Freedom hosting was forced to install malware on servers, which attacked the browsers used by tor clients.
This attack did not itself directly expose Silk Road, but Silk Road was successfully attacked at about the same time, so, possibly part of the same operation.
Silk Road was directly attacked by malware - they issued numerous complaints about this, and were repeatedly taken down by malware.  This happened at about the same time as the Freedom Hosting malware, though there is no direct evidence of a direct connection, other than timing and modus operandi.
Simply generating huge amounts of spam and firing it off at Silk Road from time to time would enable a correlation attack.  We know, however, that Silk Road was attacked both by huge amounts of spam, and malware.

Who on this list has not done so?
Of course people usually use Thunderbird on their main computer, which generally does not have a gps, but it usually has a wifi card. Thunderbird detects the nearest wifi networks .
When google does street view for Google Earth, they also detect nearby wifi networks, so the data supplied by Thunderbird is matched against the data collected by google during street view surveys.
Thus, whenever and wherever you use Thunderbird, google can supply the authorities with the closest street address to where you are using Thunderbird, and pictures taken from the street very close to that address.  Thus the authorities not only have your email, which being sent in the clear has no expectation of privacy, but also a picture of building that you are sitting in when sending the email.

David Petraeus would disagree - particularly as he got nailed for using email from an inappropriate location, not for web browsing from an inappropriate location.  Notice while your link piously gives an innocent explanation for what Firefox is doing with a list of nearby wifi points, your link does not discuss what the hell Thunderbird is doing with a list of nearby wifi points.
The document you cite says that if you OK a website knowing where you are, your browser then sends that website (not Google) your location, which can indeed happen if you fiddle with the settings.  What, however, happens in the default setting, is that if you OK a website knowing where you are, your browser does not send them a list of your nearby wifi points, but instead tells them to request your location from Google.  There seems to be no technological reason why they cannot request your location from Google without waiting for your browser to tell them to do so, though I suppose Google might be displeased.
Which procedure implies that Google already has a list of your nearby wifi points, from which it has already deduced your location.

CAs do not work very well, because no one knows or trusts the CA, the CA does not know anyone, and it is a lot jumping through hoops to persuade the CA to trust anyone.
As a result, any procedure that has the step "First the end user gets a certificate from the CA and installs that certificate" never flies. It is just too much of a pain in the ass.
This is not matter of people fearing vast powerful quasi governmental conspiracies. (Though in view of recent leaks, you should fear vast powerful quasi governmental conspiracies)
The problem is that the CA model itself does not work.  The problem is not that they are in bed with your enemies, though they probably are. The problem is that they are not in bed with you.
x.509 is evil.
x.509 is designed for universe ruled by a single state, that state the fount of all trust, all nyms, and all relationships.
Reality, however, is that relationships and trust are predominantly peer to peer, thus anything touched by x.509 somehow always develops an absolutely horrid user interface.
When we apply x.509 to a universe far more anarchic than it was designed for, bad things happen to the UI.
What your proposed system intends to provide is reputational information.  You need some entity, a server, likely a tor hidden service, to curate reputational information, and charge a fee for doing so:  You are competing with ebay, whose main asset is their large collection of other people's reputational information.
Let us call such entities, entities that collect and curate reputational information, reputational servers, ebay being the big example of a reputational server.
You would like to be able to transport reputational information, so that it is public domain, not the private property of a given reputation server.  So you don't want reputational information to be information about joe though of course you should present it that way, rather than displaying public key information directly in the UI (employ Zooko's triangle, and never throw 256 bit random numbers in the end user's face)
So, has to be the reputation of the owner of a bitcoin wallet, not the reputation of the owner of x.509 certificate.

You hope to associate a reputation with that globally unique user name.
x.509 does not actually work, as the phishers routinely demonstrate.
People are used to logging into their bank, and getting slung from one certificate to the next, none of the certificates having much resemblance to the name of their bank.
Further, the process of getting and installing an x.509 public key is too horrid for the ordinary end user to deal with.
Use zooko's triangle.  Associate reputation with a public key, and present to the user not the public key, but the account of the owner of that public key on the reputation server that curates the reputational

Two security failures:  The feds were able to find the Tor hidden web server, and, having found it, there was information on the web server that should not have been there.
My understanding is that they found a bunch of Tor machines, installed malware by means of rubber hoses, and thus located the Silk Road hidden web server.

Freedom hosting was forced to install malware on servers, which attacked the browsers used by tor clients.
This attack did not itself directly expose Silk Road, but Silk Road was successfully attacked at about the same time, so, possibly part of the same operation.
Silk Road was directly attacked by malware - they issued numerous complaints about this, and were repeatedly taken down by malware.  This happened at about the same time as the Freedom Hosting malware, though there is no direct evidence of a direct connection, other than timing and modus operandi.
Simply generating huge amounts of spam and firing it off at Silk Road from time to time would enable a correlation attack.  We know, however, that Silk Road was attacked both by huge amounts of spam, and malware.

I would expect that Julian Assange would assiduously turn off the tracking, but his playmates probably would not.

Of course people usually use Thunderbird on their main computer, which generally does not have a gps, but it usually has a wifi card. Thunderbird detects the nearest wifi networks .
When google does street view for Google Earth, they also detect nearby wifi networks, so the data supplied by Thunderbird is matched against the data collected by google during street view surveys.
Thus, whenever and wherever you use Thunderbird, google can supply the authorities with the closest street address to where you are using Thunderbird, and pictures taken from the street very close to that address.  Thus the authorities not only have your email, which being sent in the clear has no expectation of privacy, but also a picture of building that you are sitting in when sending the email.

CAs do not work very well, because no one knows or trusts the CA, the CA does not know anyone, and it is a lot jumping through hoops to persuade the CA to trust anyone.
As a result, any procedure that has the step "First the end user gets a certificate from the CA and installs that certificate" never flies. It is just too much of a pain in the ass.
This is not matter of people fearing vast powerful quasi governmental conspiracies. (Though in view of recent leaks, you should fear vast powerful quasi governmental conspiracies)

When we apply x.509 to a universe far more anarchic than it was designed for, bad things happen to the UI.
What your proposed system intends to provide is reputational information.

Freedom hosting was forced to install malware on servers, which attacked the browsers used by tor clients.
This attack did not itself directly expose Silk Road, but Silk Road was successfully attacked at about the same time, so, possibly part of the same operation.
Silk Road was directly attacked by malware - they issued numerous complaints about this, and were repeatedly taken down by malware.  This happened at about the same time as the Freedom Hosting malware, though there is no direct evidence of a direct connection, other than timing and modus operandi.
Simply generating huge amounts of spam and firing it off at Silk Road from time to time would enable a correlation attack.  We know, however, that Silk Road was attacked both by huge amounts of spam, and malware.

In a world were laws typically are many thousands of pages long, universal surveillance is a problem.
Laws and regulations have been expanding exponentially.  It is said, but is impossible to verify or falsify, that ever person with significant business interests commits around three felonies a day.
I get the impression that the rate of increase is itself increasing, which projects to a left singularity - infinite legislation in finite time in our near future, but I don't have the numbers to project when the singularity arrives.
Is there any way to find the total amount of legislation in each year?
It used to be that one could know how much regulation by sizing the federal register, but this is no longer the case.  We have already hit the event horizon of regulation, in that the federal register has ceased to have any meaning.  These days most regulations cannot be found in any well defined or meaningful place, and if they could be found it would not be much use, since current doctrine is that regulations are defeated by people merely obeying them, since this always leads to the law of unintended consequences, that mere obedience is a sneaky form of de-regulation.  Rather, those regulated should believe and have faith in the purposes for which the regulations were passed.  As was illustrated with the Bank of Beverly Hills, compliance with regulations no longer suffices: Holiness, faith, and zeal is required.  Ye shall not be saved by works, but by faith.  For Beverly Hills bank, it was insufficient to obey the regulators.  Their staff had to believe in the regulators.
We are close to reaching the same situation in legislation as we have already achieved in regulation, where legislation becomes a form of prayer, as regulation already has, so that the mere words on paper cease to have meaning or effect.

What went wrong is that all the banks were cuddling up to the regulators and telling the regulators what they wanted to hear, and in particular and especially, Washington Mutual was doing so.
Jim Bell's denial of disservice program is the opposite of cuddling up to the regulators.   Banks that cuddle will be punished, but banks that fail to cuddle will be punished more, thus he is unlikely to get support for denial of disservice, unless he disguises it as some sort of public good program to ensure that black rapists and muggers get off.
Here is a bit of background on the illegal acts committed by Washington Mutual, and how JP Morgan wound up with responsibility for these illegal acts.  I don't know what happened with Bear Sterns.
The law required equal outcomes for blacks, hispanics, and whites.
The law also required that the banks only lend to people with income and savings.  However, banks that followed that law, for example the Bank of Beverly Hills got in trouble because they were violating the equal outcomes law.
To make the regulators happy, Washington Mutual lied that its customers had income and savings.  All the banks lied, some more than others.  The bigger the lies, the happier the regulators.  The biggest liars, and the most blessed by the regulators, were Washington Mutual and Countrywide.
In 2005 November, all the lies blew up horribly in people's faces. However, from 2005 to 2008, the government required a big game of pretend and extend, in which everyone pretended the lies were true.
And, as part of the pretense that the lies were true, even though the shit had already hit the fan, JP Morgan was forced to buy Washington Mutual even though everyone knew that Washington Mutual was a stinking pile of toxic assets.
JP Morgan is now being punished for the lies told by Washington Mutual.

Ripples consensus algorithm is weight of club members, and the process for getting into the club is opaque, as are the interests and incentives of the existing club members.
I would suppose one gets into the club if no existing member blackballs you, which would be fine if there is already sufficient diversity of interests within the club.
It is not obvious to me how well the ripple consensus algorithm would work in the event of substantial conflicts between club members, or bad behavior by club members, or bad things happening to the network.
Has it been analyzed for performance in the event of bad behavior by some club members?

A sysadmin tries to keep his systems working.  Aaron Swartz was
disruptively trespassing on their systems - he was arrogantly and
obnoxiously aggressing against them.
And that, in fact, was what he was charged with, not with releasing
JSTOR IP property, but with screwing up other people's computers.
If he had been furtive about collecting the data, the way Snowden was,
there never would have been any problem.
The problem was that Aaron Swartz was an arrogant asshole who thought
he was ruling class and above the law, and that those he aggressed
against were menials beneath the law - the Henry Louis Gates
One of the things our ruling class filters against is conspicuous and
obnoxious arrogance.  They don't want us noticing them.  Aaron Swartz
failed the conspicuous arrogance filter before being granted tenure,

You are perhaps saying it frequently requires no skill, other than fraud or burglary, to muck up someone else's network.  Indeed it does not.
Nonetheless, mucking up someone else's network by such simple means is hacking in the first meaning of the word, hacking as an aggressive or criminal act.
Because hacking from a distance requires skill, particularly if a network has some halfway competent defenses, the word "hack" has also come to mean some impressively clever stuff done with computers, but the original meaning was simply bad stuff done by computer - and, in the early days of the internet, it was possible to do bad stuff by computer with very little skill.
And even today, it is possible to do bad stuff by computer with very little skill if one physically accesses a network that is not intended or expected to be accessed by outsiders.

"On Saturday, October 9, we again detected rapid downloading, this
time at an even faster rate. The downloading overloaded several
servers, disrupting access to JSTOR for users beyond MIT."
What led to his arrest was that he physically entered the building,
and physically entered the closet where their network was connected
up, and physically messed with their network wiring to attach his
laptop Burglary and physical damage.
Which physical damage led to network dysfunction.
Tracing the network failure, the sysadmins found his alterations to
their network, and left the laptop where it was, placing a camera near
the closet to detect the criminal's return to pick up the laptop.
In due course, Aaron Schwarz shows up on video picking up his laptop.
The sysadmins never displayed much interest in the fact that
he had earlier illegally downloaded huge numbers of articles.  They
got pissed, and he got charged, for entering the building and messing
with their wiring.
If he had kept his downloads non disruptive by limiting the download
rate, by being furtive as Edward Snowden was furtive, no one would
have bothered - and proof of this is that they did not bother.
He wanted to smack their faces with the fact that he was ruling class

through a bunch of zombies to disguise the IP, would have rate limited
the download so as not to stick out and not produce an obnoxious and

The term hacker first appears 1975 - 1985, shortly after the start of the information epoch, the age of information starting by convention 1972 January first.
The term was originally an epithet, but not for criminal behavior:
At that time, 1980, a hacker was someone who programs for entertainment - badly.
In 1983,  a hacker is someone whose interest in programming has damaging consequences for his social life and social skills, but he is a very good programmer.
Then we hear that the original hacker was the phone phreak captain crunch, implying that a hacker is someone who breaks into other people's systems to take control of other people's stuff, generally to give himself free stuff.
"High noon on the electronic frontier", a 1996 book, talks about rehabilitating the term, and complains that "hacker" "carries the image of persons who are dangerous" (page 151)
So, evidently, the term was in need of rehabilitation.
In 1996, esr owns the term, and gives it a positive meaning.
So, hackers were something bad, then something criminal, and then, in 1996, we had a hacker pride movement, with esr as the key figure.
Hence, esr, for all his faults, is generally regarded as the prophet of the programming subculture.
But, before he was prophet, needed his people to be in bondage so that he could lead them out of bondage.

The reason Aaron Swartz was repeatedly detected and repeatedly blocked
was because of the crudity of his attack:(sequential downloads at
maximum  speed, disrupting JSTOR with excessive load)
Had he rate limited his downloads to avoid disrupting the network, and
hidden the sequential nature of his downloads through a random
permutation, he would have been fine.  No one competent to detect him
and block him would have cared enough to do so.

Whites report that Indians, when they got the chance, killed a very
large number of buffalo and ate only the tongues.
The South American Indians had better technology than the North American Indians, and killed almost everything larger than a dog.  If the North American Indians had had metal, would have killed everthing larger than a rabbit.
Colonel Calloway, at the urging of Daniel Boone, purchased the south
side of the Kentucky River from the Indians.  They spent the money in
short order, and having spent the money, wanted the land back,
starting a war against the whites, a war against Daniel Boone and
Colonel Calloway, which turned out to be a really bad idea.
This was the general pattern, repeated over and over, with land
purchases leading to extraordinarily terrible Indian wars.  By and
large, Indian wars resulted from the short time preference of the
Indians relative to the longer time preference of the whites.  Indians
would make bad deals, a lot of land for a little whiskey, then after
the whites arrived and had created facts on the ground, the Indians
would change their minds, even though it was by then far too late to
change their minds.
If the Indians had had reasonable time preference, they would have
been able to hold out for a fair deal, and then stick to it.  Once
whites started to arrive, it was a really bad time for the Indians to
turn around and break the deal, but nonetheless it was usually the
Indians that broke the deal, usually by abducting children, sometimes
by scalping children and burning them alive.  Not only would they
break the deal, but break it at the worst time for themselves, in the
worst way for themselves, and in the most evil and horrible possible

If you call it racism and sexism when characteristically male standards are upheld, this implicitly admits that women are different from men, and therefore in some activities and aspects inferior, while in others, the properly feminine sphere, superior.
If women are equal to men, then they deserve to be called out if they fail to live up to characteristically male standards.
If on the other hand, women are not equal to men, and require special treatment,  then they deserve a condescending pat on the head when they show up in male forums and need to be gently shepherded to a properly feminine environment, where they will not feel so out of place.   You are trying to have your cake and eat it as well, one way equality, wherein women are not only equal to men, but more equal than men.
If you call it racism and sexism when characteristically male standards are upheld, this has the unfortunate result that male behavior gets replaced by female behavior: Whereupon you get Katherine Hultgreen doing an Amelia Earhart.
If feminism is the principle that women are equal to men, cannot be the Katherine Hultgreen/Amelia Earhart principle that women get special treatment to accommodate their failings and weaknesses.
That path does not work.
Characteristically male environments are characteristically male because of characteristically male virtues.  Characteristically female environment are characteristically female because of characteristically female virtues.  If we are to have integration without social decay, then females entering a characteristically male environment need to live up to difficult, stressful, uncomfortable, and unfamiliar standards, as Katherine Hultgreen demonstrated in the most dramatic and terrible possible fashion, and Cari Matchet demonstrated in a more frivolous and amusing fashion.

In an effort to manufacture a poster girl, Hultgreen was required to attempt to land on an aircraft carrier, and in due course, killed herself, demonstrating why every naval pilot is male.
You can affirmative action women to all sorts of jobs, and furtively have a white male do the actual job, but the reason all naval pilots are males is that when you affirmative action someone to naval pilot and expect them to land on a carrier, they die.  There is room in an office for males to do the actual work, but there is no room in a warplane for a second pilot to do the actual piloting.
You can put girls in the army, and all that immediately happens is that the march slows down, but you cannot put girls in the naval airforce, and make the carriers bigger and the planes slower.  In a plane built for male abilities, landing on a ship built for male abilities, they have to fly like males.  And, of course, they cannot.  They tested her, in testing she repeated made errors that would have killed her.  She was the best female pilot available, so they had her do real landings regardless, so that they could have a poster girl.
Amelia Earhart was initially given a ticker tape parade and a meeting with the president for being flown across the Atlantic like a sack of potatoes by a male pilot, but the cognitive dissonance being too great, such a poster girl attracting ridicule, they eventually had Amelia Earhart and Kara Hultgreen attempt to perform difficult piloting tasks for real, killing them.
In due course we will have female naval pilots with same uniforms as male pilots.  The unisex uniforms will be made girly.  The traditions will be made girlie or abolished.  Male camraderie will be forbidden. References to nuts and bolts will be forbidden as excessively sexist. But the female naval pilots will not actually be required to fly carrier

The reason they would not let her pilot the plane on the flight for which she got the ticker tape parade is that she could not safely pilot the plane for which she got the ticker tape parade.  That they would not let her fly it, despite extreme pressure to do so, suggests that if the had let her fly it, she would have gotten killed all the faster.
If unsafe to let her fly one plane, unsafe to let her fly another very similar plane.
They have been looking for a female pilot for the navy ever since they had aircraft carriers.  In all these years, could not find one, so, under ever increasing pressure to include women, decided to go with Kara Hultgreen, because she was the best, which is to say the least bad they could find.
PC killed Amelia Earhart, and PC killed Kara Hultgreen.
Similarly, successful businesses stuff all their female executives into HR, keeping them away from decisions that could screw up the business.
In due course, we will have non flying navy pilots with same uniforms and honors as flying navy pilots, and all the female pilots will be non flying.  All the naval pilots that actually fly will be given girly uniforms.  Emasculation will be required in order to provide a more female friendly environment for the non flying pilots.

Corporations are people.
If you grant lesser rights to corporations than to natural people, then the state can, and will, make corporations fire anyone suspected of thinking politically incorrect thoughts.
Turned on the news last night, they were interviewing some silicon valley people, and the interviewer asked about how corporations viewed this and that.  One of the interviewees replied "I am a corporation". He complained that he was subject to secret orders by a secret court, which lawless orders he could not tell anyone about, that he himself was being spied upon, that as well as being required to turn over information officially, his information was being stolen unofficially, and that foreign customers had (correctly) come to distrust him.
A corporation is freedom of association, a group of people that agree together to act as one.
In order to act as one, they delegate complete power over the collective assets of the project to one of themselves, the CEO, who is, often one of the major shareholders.  Thus a corporation is people, people agreeing to associate, and corporation is a person, in that the people agreeing to associate commonly nominate one of themselves to be that person.

They were not "ratting" on him
A sysadmin tries to keep his systems working.  Aaron Swartz was
disruptively trespassing on their systems - he was arrogantly and
obnoxiously aggressing against them.
And that, in fact, was what he was charged with, not with releasing
JSTOR IP property, but with screwing up other people's computers.
If he had been furtive about collecting the data, the way Snowden was,
there never would have been any problem.
The problem was that Aaron Swartz was an arrogant asshole who thought
he was ruling class and above the law, and that those he aggressed
against were menials beneath the law - the Henry Louis Gates
One of the things our ruling class filters against is conspicuous and
obnoxious arrogance.  They don't want us noticing them.  Aaron Swartz
failed the conspicuous arrogance filter before being granted tenure,

You are perhaps saying it frequently requires no skill, other than fraud or burglary, to muck up someone else's network.  Indeed it does not.
Nonetheless, mucking up someone else's network by such simple means is hacking in the first meaning of the word, hacking as an aggressive or criminal act.
Because hacking from a distance requires skill, particularly if a network has some halfway competent defenses, the word "hack" has also come to mean some impressively clever stuff done with computers, but the original meaning was simply bad stuff done by computer - and, in the early days of the internet, it was possible to do bad stuff by computer with very little skill.
And even today, it is possible to do bad stuff by computer with very little skill if one physically accesses a network that is not intended or expected to be accessed by outsiders.

This claim requires more justification than I gave it.
Obviously Alinsky would never use language that demeans women or black people.  His language not only implies that women and blacks are equal to white males, but that they are more equal than black males.
And yet, somehow, strangely, when he gives concrete and specific examples of the use of his tactics, it is a white male doing the manipulation, and women, blacks, and poor people being manipulated.

"On Saturday, October 9, we again detected rapid downloading, this
time at an even faster rate. The downloading overloaded several
servers, disrupting access to JSTOR for users beyond MIT."
What led to his arrest was that he physically entered the building,
and physically entered the closet where their network was connected
up, and physically messed with their network wiring to attach his
laptop Burglary and physical damage.
Which physical damage led to network dysfunction.
Tracing the network failure, the sysadmins found his alterations to
their network, and left the laptop where it was, placing a camera near
the closet to detect the criminal's return to pick up the laptop.
In due course, Aaron Schwarz shows up on video picking up his laptop.
The sysadmins never displayed much interest in the fact that
he had earlier illegally downloaded huge numbers of articles.  They
got pissed, and he got charged, for entering the building and messing
with their wiring.
If he had kept his downloads non disruptive by limiting the download
rate, by being furtive as Edward Snowden was furtive, no one would
have bothered - and proof of this is that they did not bother.
He wanted to smack their faces with the fact that he was ruling class
and they were mere minions, that the laws of the ruling class are

Aaron Swartz was not charged downloading articles without paying, but
with disrupting a network on which his menial inferiors depended.

If I had been in the closet and screwed with the network wiring (which
I would not have done since the network was wide open to competent
attack from safely far away) I would have screwed with the network
wiring in such a fashion as to produce no easily noticeable effects.
If I had been doing what Schwarz was doing, I would have proxied
through a bunch of zombies to disguise the IP, would have rate limited
the download so as not to stick out and not produce an obnoxious and
noticeable disruption, and would have done a pseudo random permutation
on the order so that it was not obvious sequential, thus not obvious
the intent was to download the entire database, so that it looked as
if particular specific articles were being downloaded.
And all that would have been overkill, for if no disruption of the
network, no one who had the skills to detect it and do something about
it would have cared.

Property rights are the boundaries between one man's plan and another man's plan.  If the ruling elite casually violate property rights, then, as with Obamacare, the result is chaos, which must be resolved by one plan imposed on all to restore order in order to avoid collapse.

The term hacker first appears 1975 - 1985, shortly after the start of the information epoch, the age of information starting by convention 1972 January first.
The term was originally an epithet, but not for criminal behavior:
At that time, 1980, a hacker was someone who programs for entertainment - badly.
In 1983,  a hacker is someone whose interest in programming has damaging consequences for his social life and social skills, but he is a very good programmer.
Then we hear that the original hacker was the phone phreak captain crunch, implying that a hacker is someone who breaks into other people's systems to take control of other people's stuff, generally to give himself free stuff.
"High noon on the electronic frontier", a 1996 book, talks about rehabilitating the term, and complains that "hacker" "carries the image of persons who are dangerous" (page 151)
So, evidently, the term was in need of rehabilitation.
In 1996, esr owns the term, and gives it a positive meaning.
So, hackers were something bad, then something criminal, and then, in 1996, we had a hacker pride movement, with esr as the key figure.
Hence, esr, for all his faults, is generally regarded as the prophet of the programming subculture.
But, before he was prophet, needed his people to be in bondage so that he could lead them out of bondage.

The reason Aaron Swartz was repeatedly detected and repeatedly blocked
was because of the crudity of his attack:(sequential downloads at
maximum  speed, disrupting JSTOR with excessive load)
Had he rate limited his downloads to avoid disrupting the network, and
hidden the sequential nature of his downloads through a random
permutation, he would have been fine.  No one competent to detect him
and block him would have cared enough to do so.

Aaron Swartz entered the closet where the networks were all wired up

MIT, however. made no real effort to identify the person responsible until he brought their network to a grinding halt.
Aaron Swartz was arrested for pissing off the sysadmins, and he pissed off the sysadmins by busting their wiring in their wiring closet.

How do you think the horse became extinct in the Americas, the

Whites report that Indians, when they got the chance, killed a very
large number of buffalo and ate only the tongues.
The South American Indians had better technology than the North American Indians, and killed almost everything larger than a dog.  If the North American Indians had had metal, would have killed everthing larger than a rabbit.
Colonel Calloway, at the urging of Daniel Boone, purchased the south
side of the Kentucky River from the Indians.  They spent the money in
short order, and having spent the money, wanted the land back,
starting a war against the whites, a war against Daniel Boone and
Colonel Calloway, which turned out to be a really bad idea.
This was the general pattern, repeated over and over, with land
purchases leading to extraordinarily terrible Indian wars.  By and
large, Indian wars resulted from the short time preference of the
Indians relative to the longer time preference of the whites.  Indians
would make bad deals, a lot of land for a little whiskey, then after
the whites arrived and had created facts on the ground, the Indians
would change their minds, even though it was by then far too late to
change their minds.
If the Indians had had reasonable time preference, they would have
been able to hold out for a fair deal, and then stick to it.  Once
whites started to arrive, it was a really bad time for the Indians to
turn around and break the deal, but nonetheless it was usually the
Indians that broke the deal, usually by abducting children, sometimes
by scalping children and burning them alive.  Not only would they
break the deal, but break it at the worst time for themselves, in the
worst way for themselves, and in the most evil and horrible possible

One way accommodation, wherein men accommodate female differences, but females do not accommodate male differences, is dysfunctional, as demonstrated by Katherine Hultgreen, and also admits the inequality that it denies.
If you call it racism and sexism when characteristically male standards are upheld, this implicitly admits that women are different from men, and therefore in some activities and aspects inferior, while in others, the properly feminine sphere, superior.
If women are equal to men, then they deserve to be called out if they fail to live up to characteristically male standards.
If on the other hand, women are not equal to men, and require special treatment,  then they deserve a condescending pat on the head when they show up in male forums and need to be gently shepherded to a properly feminine environment, where they will not feel so out of place.   You are trying to have your cake and eat it as well, one way equality, wherein women are not only equal to men, but more equal than men.
If you call it racism and sexism when characteristically male standards are upheld, this has the unfortunate result that male behavior gets replaced by female behavior: Whereupon you get Katherine Hultgreen doing an Amelia Earhart.
If feminism is the principle that women are equal to men, cannot be the Katherine Hultgreen/Amelia Earhart principle that women get special treatment to accommodate their failings and weaknesses.

In an effort to manufacture a poster girl, Hultgreen was required to attempt to land on an aircraft carrier, and in due course, killed herself, demonstrating why every naval pilot is male.
You can affirmative action women to all sorts of jobs, and furtively have a white male do the actual job, but the reason all naval pilots are males is that when you affirmative action someone to naval pilot and expect them to land on a carrier, they die.  There is room in an office for males to do the actual work, but there is no room in a warplane for a second pilot to do the actual piloting.
You can put girls in the army, and all that immediately happens is that the march slows down, but you cannot put girls in the naval airforce, and make the carriers bigger and the planes slower.  In a plane built for male abilities, landing on a ship built for male abilities, they have to fly like males.  And, of course, they cannot.  They tested her, in testing she repeated made errors that would have killed her.  She was the best female pilot available, so they had her do real landings regardless, so that they could have a poster girl.
Amelia Earhart was initially given a ticker tape parade and a meeting with the president for being flown across the Atlantic like a sack of potatoes by a male pilot, but the cognitive dissonance being too great, such a poster girl attracting ridicule, they eventually had Amelia Earhart and Kara Hultgreen attempt to perform difficult piloting tasks for real, killing them.
In due course we will have female naval pilots with same uniforms as male pilots.  The unisex uniforms will be made girly.  The traditions will be made girlie or abolished.  Male camraderie will be forbidden. References to nuts and bolts will be forbidden as excessively sexist. But the female naval pilots will not actually be required to fly carrier

If unsafe to let her fly one plane, unsafe to let her fly another very similar plane.
They have been looking for a female pilot for the navy ever since they had aircraft carriers.  In all these years, could not find one, so, under ever increasing pressure to include women, decided to go with Kara Hultgreen, because she was the best, which is to say the least bad they could find.
PC killed Amelia Earhart, and PC killed Kara Hultgreen.
Similarly, successful businesses stuff all their female executives into HR, keeping them away from decisions that could screw up the business.
In due course, we will have non flying navy pilots with same uniforms and honors as flying navy pilots, and all the female pilots will be non flying.  All the naval pilots that actually fly will be given girly uniforms.  Emasculation will be required in order to provide a more female friendly environment for the non flying pilots.

Turned on the news last night, they were interviewing some silicon valley people, and the interviewer asked about how corporations viewed this and that.

A corporation is freedom of association, a group of people that agree together to act as one.
In order to act as one, they delegate complete power over the collective assets of the project to one of themselves, the CEO, who is, often one of the major shareholders.  Thus a corporation is people, people agreeing to associate, and corporation is a person, in that the people agreeing to associate commonly nominate one of themselves to be that person.

If he had rate limited his download so as to not be disruptive,
probably would not have been detected, and would not have provoked the
people operating the network to go looking for him.
That he did not rate limit the download is an announcement "I am

A sysadmin tries to keep his systems working.  Aaron Swartz was
disruptively trespassing on their systems - he was arrogantly and
obnoxiously aggressing against them.
And that, in fact, was what he was charged with, not with releasing
JSTOR IP property, but with screwing up other people's computers.
If he had been furtive about collecting the data, the way Snowden was,
there never would have been any problem.
The problem was that Aaron Swartz was an arrogant asshole who thought
he was ruling class and above the law, and that those he aggressed
against were menials beneath the law - the Henry Louis Gates
One of the things our ruling class filters against is conspicuous and
obnoxious arrogance.  They don't want us noticing them.  Aaron Swartz

You are perhaps saying it frequently requires no skill, other than fraud or burglary, to muck up someone else's network.  Indeed it does not.
Nonetheless, mucking up someone else's network by such simple means is hacking in the first meaning of the word, hacking as an aggressive or criminal act.
Because hacking from a distance requires skill, particularly if a network has some halfway competent defenses, the word "hack" has also come to mean some impressively clever stuff done with computers, but the original meaning was simply bad stuff done by computer - and, in the early days of the internet, it was possible to do bad stuff by computer with very little skill.
And even today, it is possible to do bad stuff by computer with very little skill if one physically accesses a network that is not intended or expected to be accessed by outsiders.

"On Saturday, October 9, we again detected rapid downloading, this
time at an even faster rate. The downloading overloaded several
servers, disrupting access to JSTOR for users beyond MIT."
What led to his arrest was that he physically entered the building,
and physically entered the closet where their network was connected
up, and physically messed with their network wiring to attach his
laptop Burglary and physical damage.
Which physical damage led to network dysfunction.
Tracing the network failure, the sysadmins found his alterations to
their network, and left the laptop where it was, placing a camera near
the closet to detect the criminal's return to pick up the laptop.
In due course, Aaron Schwarz shows up on video picking up his laptop.
The sysadmins never displayed much interest in the fact that
he had earlier illegally downloaded huge numbers of articles.  They
got pissed, and he got charged, for entering the building and messing
with their wiring.
If he had kept his downloads non disruptive by limiting the download
rate, by being furtive as Edward Snowden was furtive, no one would
have bothered - and proof of this is that they did not bother.
He wanted to smack their faces with the fact that he was ruling class

through a bunch of zombies to disguise the IP, would have rate limited
the download so as not to stick out and not produce an obnoxious and

the intent was to download the entire database, so that it looked as

The term hacker first appears 1975 - 1985, shortly after the start of the information epoch, the age of information starting by convention 1972 January first.
The term was originally an epithet, but not for criminal behavior:
At that time, 1980, a hacker was someone who programs for entertainment - badly.
In 1983,  a hacker is someone whose interest in programming has damaging consequences for his social life and social skills, but he is a very good programmer.
Then we hear that the original hacker was the phone phreak captain crunch, implying that a hacker is someone who breaks into other people's systems to take control of other people's stuff, generally to give himself free stuff.
"High noon on the electronic frontier", a 1996 book, talks about rehabilitating the term, and complains that "hacker" "carries the image of persons who are dangerous" (page 151)
So, evidently, the term was in need of rehabilitation.
In 1996, esr owns the term, and gives it a positive meaning.
So, hackers were something bad, then something criminal, and then, in 1996, we had a hacker pride movement, with esr as the key figure.
Hence, esr, for all his faults, is generally regarded as the prophet of the programming subculture.
But, before he was prophet, needed his people to be in bondage so that he could lead them out of bondage.

The reason Aaron Swartz was repeatedly detected and repeatedly blocked
was because of the crudity of his attack:(sequential downloads at
maximum  speed, disrupting JSTOR with excessive load)
Had he rate limited his downloads to avoid disrupting the network, and
hidden the sequential nature of his downloads through a random
permutation, he would have been fine.  No one competent to detect him
and block him would have cared enough to do so.

Whites report that Indians, when they got the chance, killed a very
large number of buffalo and ate only the tongues.
The South American Indians had better technology than the North American Indians, and killed almost everything larger than a dog.  If the North American Indians had had metal, would have killed everthing larger than a rabbit.
Colonel Calloway, at the urging of Daniel Boone, purchased the south
side of the Kentucky River from the Indians.  They spent the money in
short order, and having spent the money, wanted the land back,
starting a war against the whites, a war against Daniel Boone and
Colonel Calloway, which turned out to be a really bad idea.
This was the general pattern, repeated over and over, with land
purchases leading to extraordinarily terrible Indian wars.  By and
large, Indian wars resulted from the short time preference of the
Indians relative to the longer time preference of the whites.  Indians
would make bad deals, a lot of land for a little whiskey, then after
the whites arrived and had created facts on the ground, the Indians
would change their minds, even though it was by then far too late to
change their minds.
If the Indians had had reasonable time preference, they would have
been able to hold out for a fair deal, and then stick to it.  Once
whites started to arrive, it was a really bad time for the Indians to
turn around and break the deal, but nonetheless it was usually the
Indians that broke the deal, usually by abducting children, sometimes
by scalping children and burning them alive.  Not only would they
break the deal, but break it at the worst time for themselves, in the
worst way for themselves, and in the most evil and horrible possible

If women are equal to men, then they deserve to be called out if they fail to live up to characteristically male standards.
If on the other hand, women are not equal to men, and require special treatment,  then they deserve a condescending pat on the head when they show up in male forums and need to be gently shepherded to a properly feminine environment, where they will not feel so out of place.   You are trying to have your cake and eat it as well, one way equality, wherein women are not only equal to men, but more equal than men.
If you call it racism and sexism when characteristically male standards are upheld, this has the unfortunate result that male behavior gets replaced by female behavior: Whereupon you get Katherine Hultgreen doing an Amelia Earhart.
If feminism is the principle that women are equal to men, cannot be the Katherine Hultgreen/Amelia Earhart principle that women get special treatment to accommodate their failings and weaknesses.
That path does not work.

If it was privilege, it would not have been necessary to kill Amelia Earhart and Kara Hultgreen in the effort to manufacture poster girls.

In an effort to manufacture a poster girl, Hultgreen was required to attempt to land on an aircraft carrier, and in due course, killed herself, demonstrating why every naval pilot is male.
You can affirmative action women to all sorts of jobs, and furtively have a white male do the actual job, but the reason all naval pilots are males is that when you affirmative action someone to naval pilot and expect them to land on a carrier, they die.  There is room in an office for males to do the actual work, but there is no room in a warplane for a second pilot to do the actual piloting.
You can put girls in the army, and all that immediately happens is that the march slows down, but you cannot put girls in the naval airforce, and make the carriers bigger and the planes slower.  In a plane built for male abilities, landing on a ship built for male abilities, they have to fly like males.  And, of course, they cannot.  They tested her, in testing she repeated made errors that would have killed her.  She was the best female pilot available, so they had her do real landings regardless, so that they could have a poster girl.
Amelia Earhart was initially given a ticker tape parade and a meeting with the president for being flown across the Atlantic like a sack of potatoes by a male pilot, but the cognitive dissonance being too great, such a poster girl attracting ridicule, they eventually had Amelia Earhart and Kara Hultgreen attempt to perform difficult piloting tasks for real, killing them.
In due course we will have female naval pilots with same uniforms as male pilots.  The unisex uniforms will be made girly.  The traditions will be made girlie or abolished.  Male camraderie will be forbidden. References to nuts and bolts will be forbidden as excessively sexist. But the female naval pilots will not actually be required to fly carrier

The reason they would not let her pilot the plane on the flight for which she got the ticker tape parade is that she could not safely pilot the plane for which she got the ticker tape parade.  That they would not let her fly it, despite extreme pressure to do so, suggests that if the had let her fly it, she would have gotten killed all the faster.
If unsafe to let her fly one plane, unsafe to let her fly another very similar plane.
They have been looking for a female pilot for the navy ever since they had aircraft carriers.  In all these years, could not find one, so, under ever increasing pressure to include women, decided to go with Kara Hultgreen, because she was the best, which is to say the least bad they could find.
PC killed Amelia Earhart, and PC killed Kara Hultgreen.
Similarly, successful businesses stuff all their female executives into HR, keeping them away from decisions that could screw up the business.
In due course, we will have non flying navy pilots with same uniforms and honors as flying navy pilots, and all the female pilots will be non flying.  All the naval pilots that actually fly will be given girly uniforms.  Emasculation will be required in order to provide a more female friendly environment for the non flying pilots.

Compare photos of men of 1950, with photos of men today.  We *are*

forced feminization, but undeniably something really bad is happening.
And the fact that no one is paying attention suggests that the problem is forced feminization rather than some mystery pollutant.

The reason the blue empire is destroying the morale and cohesion of the US military forces is that it is more afraid of those forces than it is of external enemies.

Suppose the political elite are not in agreement - and they are

footsoldiers to implement the policy, and tell their footsoldiers to
not implement the policy - and suddenly the footsoldiers are
kingmakers, making the ruling elite nervous.

Corporations are people.
If you grant lesser rights to corporations than to natural people, then the state can, and will, make corporations fire anyone suspected of thinking politically incorrect thoughts.
Turned on the news last night, they were interviewing some silicon valley people, and the interviewer asked about how corporations viewed this and that.  One of the interviewees replied "I am a corporation". He complained that he was subject to secret orders by a secret court, which lawless orders he could not tell anyone about, that he himself was being spied upon, that as well as being required to turn over information officially, his information was being stolen unofficially, and that foreign customers had (correctly) come to distrust him.
A corporation is freedom of association, a group of people that agree together to act as one.
In order to act as one, they delegate complete power over the collective assets of the project to one of themselves, the CEO, who is, often one of the major shareholders.  Thus a corporation is people, people agreeing to associate, and corporation is a person, in that the people agreeing to associate commonly nominate one of themselves to be that person.

For example, Pax Dickinson was fired for crimethink
The person who called for his firing was Anil, who holds regulatory
government powers over the company that employed Pax Dickinson.
      I was pretty amazed that he went for it. He flat out said that he
      wants his startup to be funded and wasn’t sure if it’d be
      possible after all of his, and I replied that it realistically
      wasn’t going to happen without the say-so of someone like me, and
      I wasn’t inclined to give some VC the nod on this.
So, these days, the merely wealthy need a nod from the likes of Anil,
the powerless need to run all their decisions past the powerful.

Bank issues chaumian blinded tokens.  Each token issued must appear in the merkle tree.  If you have a blinded token that is not in the tree, not a valid token.   Each node of the tree contains the sum of the value of all tokens under that node. Further you check the validity of each branch of the tree on which your tokens appear.  So total number of tokens issued is correct.
Each unblinded token cashed is added into the Merkle tree.  If not in tree, could be recashed.  So total number tokens paid out on is correct.
Difference between these two numbers is bank liabilities for outstanding bearer tokens. So bank liability is known, even if bankers are lying through their teeth.

There are always unusual weather events of some form somewhere.
In the 1950s the North pole melted in summer.  Has not happened in recent times.
There are four thousand year old sand dunes on the shores of the arctic ocean, indicating that four thousand years ago the arctic regularly melted completely for a large part of the summer.
Similarly, the antarctic ice sheet is substantially larger than it was when the first explorers mapped it.
When people get excited about unusual melting of artic ice, they ignore unusual freezing of antarctic ice.

I need to be able to do two of the following three tasks.
Generate a permutation of eighteen ones and eighteen zeros with equal probability for each permutation.  Or equivalently shuffle eighteen black cards and eighteen red cards.
Sequentially generate all possible permutations with each permutation generated once and only once.
Map between permutations and scalars, such that each permutation maps to unique number, and the set of numbers that represents valid permutations is dense.
Could someone point me to the relevant literature, or literature for converting between different representations of a permutation?
Since there are only two classes of items being shuffled, this class of permutations has a variety of special and convenient properties.

Combinatorial number system.

This is stupid.
There is plausible historical evidence that Jesus did not rise from the dead, nor did the sun stand still over one of the Empire's dominions, but we have ample historical evidence for Jesus the man, who was crucified by Pontius Pilate, and anyone who denies it is just stupid or If anything, we have better historical evidence for Jesus the man than Mohammed the Prophet.
In actual practice, the Church was founded by Paul, who used the conveniently dead Jesus as basis for what we now know as Christianity.
Lots of aspects of the founding myth of Christianity are improbable, and either supported only by suspiciously weak evidence, or contradicted by compellingly strong evidence, but that Jesus lived and was crucified by Pontius Pilate is undeniable by anyone half way sane.
The Jewish religion was in a holiness spiral which put them on course for a suicidal confrontation with Rome, therefore one would expect a prophet to condemn this holiness spiral in exactly the manner that Jesus is recorded as condemning it.  And one would expect a prophet who spoke the truth on this matter to get crucified.  As Jesus the man is recorded as being crucified.  This aspect of the founding myth is inherently plausible, and is supported by compellingly strong evidence.

This law keeps talking about physical locations on the physical border. The core thing it does is repeal any existing obstacles to building a wall and survieling that physical border.
The reason nation states exist is that people keep invading to help themselves to other people's stuff, as for example Jose Zarate, who came here to kill people like me and take our stuff, and has proceeded to do so with impunity.
One such man is just a criminal, but when he is backed and supported by other men in this common purpose, as he is, and thus enjoys immunity and impunity through this mutual support for violent men engaged in violent acts, he is an invasion, part of an invading army.

We have very few historical records about Pontius Pilate and would expect to know even less about yet another Jewish trouble maker, of which there were a plentiful supply.  Do you doubt the existence of Pontius Pilate?
We do know the Jews were in a holiness spiral.  You would expect prophets to show up and condemn it.  You would expect such prophets to be executed - which is why the holiness spiral continued.
And you would expect such a prophet to get about as much mention in history as Jesus the man did indeed receive.

Before we came, your ancestors were eating each other.  You did not have the wheel, you failed to domesticate the sheep, the goat, or the buffalo.
You don't actually have the competence or social cohesion to cause us problems, except that the democrats have created a alliance of low and high against middle, and alliance of far against near, and this alliance is run by white people, as is obvious from photographs of the "hispanics" exercising power in that alliance.  When you take over that alliance, when high gets full of people affirmative actioned into positions of power, you will wind up eating the people who organized your alliance, eating those few remaining (mostly Jewish) democrats who are still competent.

When the decadent Spanish let south America go, it fell apart, and order was restored by the power of the USA, and to a lesser extent by Soviet power.  If the confederacy had won the war of Northern Aggression, it then would have replaced the Spaniards in South America.
All wars are white on white wars.  Whites fight over other peoples, not with them.  Only the East Asians are competent in war, and they are still nowhere near as good at it as whites.  The Vietnam war was not really whites versus East Asians, it was really the blue empire of the consulates versus the red empire of the bases.  The Vietnamese were Soviet proxies, and the Soviets were blue empire proxies.  Without Soviet backing, State Department backing, and Democratic Party backing, the Vietnamese would have been toast.

The alliance between La Raza, Black Lives Matter, and the Democrats, resembles the alliance between the Populares and the Samnites.
The Populares and the Optimates were political parties in Roman Empire, "Populare" meaning "People's party"  The Populares corresponded to today's Democrats, the coalition of the fringes, weirdoes versus normal people, minorities versus the majority, the coalition of high and low against middle.
The Populares wanted to give the Samnites (equivalent to today's La Raza) a fairer deal within the Roman Empire.
The Samnites wanted to level the walls of Rome, kill all male Romans, and enslave all Roman women.
When civil war between the political parties, between the Optimates and the Populares ensued, the alliance between Populares and Samnites proved less than entirely helpful.

While one should avoid war with outgroups, (rule of acquisition thirty five) takes two to avoid war.
Democratic party policy is to hike tribalism up to the max, to have integration but resist assimilation.  This is a program bound to end in war, democide, and genocide.
Assimilation works, integration does not. If two tribes occupy overlapping territories, either war will ensue, or one will rule, and the other be second class and forced into submissive posture.  That is human nature.
Since tribalism is also human nature, need borders with walls backed by men with guns.
The peace of Westphalia is a general formula for peace between Kings, nations, peoples, cultures, tribes, and religions.  This social technology, one of Chesterton's many abandoned fences, needs to be revived and reapplied.
Lacking this, we are seeing increasing incidents of casual violence against white males, with those guilty getting away with it, being let off by police and judiciary.   This can only escalate.  One tribe must rule, one must submit.  The Democratic Party prescription is a prescription for genocidal and democidal war, and that war is beginning.

Irrespective of whether Jesus did in fact show up after his death, he is reported as showing up after his death, thus it is likely that his followers believed that he had shown up, and this likely caused problems for the Romans, causing Roman historians unaware that he had been crucified to also believe that he had indeed shown up.

Every peer has to download every transaction, in order to judge it for validity. If relying on someone else's claim about validity, not truly a peer.  It is having many peers that makes the network resistant to control and attack.
This inherently limits the number of transactions that can be made fully on the blockchain and fully peered to something that is not compatible with taking over the world.
Thus scalability, up to world conquering scales, requires an architecture where most people do not have peer wallets, but client wallets, and most transactions are consolidated into fewer and larger transactions by important peer wallets functioning somewhat like banks before the transactions are entered into the blockchain.
The Lightning Network is intended to have transactions consolidated by important peer wallets functioning somewhat like banks, but it is not altogether clear how this will work in practice, or if it will work in

The contemporary evidence for Pontius Pilate is exactly the same as the contemporary evidence for Jesus.  Josephus was there, and he mentions both of them.
Further, it is obvious that someone resembling Pontius Pilate had to exist, because the Roman Empire dominated that region, and it is obvious that prophets resembling Jesus the man had to exist, because the rabbis were in a holiness spiral, prophets would have condemned this, and would have been executed for condemning it.
Various prophets are listed as doing this, and dying because of it, Jesus and a couple of Christians being prominent on the list.

It is plausibly *suspected* that *one* of Josephus's references to Jesus is a forgery, or more likely was improved by a Christian editor.
There is no reason to doubt his other references to Jesus.
Further, we have multiple references to the disciples of Jesus. That his movement existed is undeniable.
We know that Jesus the man existed the same way we know that Pontius Pilate existed:
Someone like Jesus the man had to exist, in that the rabbis were engaged in a holiness spiral, a holiness spiral will get called out by prophets, and then those prophets get suppressed, and someone like Pontius Pilate had to exist, in that the Roman Empire ruled the area, and history records Jesus as one of those prophets, and Pontius Pilate as one of the Roman Empire's administrators.
And if our records of Jesus the man are a bit thin, our records of Pontius Pilate are not a whole lot thicker.

In this, Wikipedia accurately reports the official consensus of official However, on the dating of the gospels, the the official consensus of official academia is evidently untruthful, dating the gospels to after the fall of the temple and Jerusalem, because the gospels report Jesus as prophesying the fall of the Temple and Jerusalem.

A religion is a synthetic tribe.   A state needs a tribe, and tribe needs a state.
Jewish religious tribalism was going nuts at the time, Roman paganism was dissolving in cynicism.
Also, Roman paganism had abandoned patriarchy, and as a result Romans had stopped reproducing.  Christianity retained Jewish patriarchy, so Christians were able to form families and reproduce.
Christianity is around because the state needed a religion, and because Christians had children.   Constantine founded state Christianity, which made a disintegrating state viable, and gave the state a ruling elite that was able to reproduce successfully, a program in due course imitated by Charles the Hammer, who proceeded to defeat Islam and found Today, the ruling state religion is progressivism, but progressives, like Romans when their religion became decadent, cannot reproduce, and like Jews, when their religion became ever more insane in a holiness spiral, are engaged in ever more self destructive and warlike government Thus, self destruction, which requires replacement by a sane and patriarchal state religion.
Conservative Islam is adequately patriarchal, but, absent a Calif, tends to madness.  Maybe we will make Mormonism the state religion, or perhaps import Russia's eastern Orthodoxy.  Our current state religion, progressivism, cannot survive, the only question is whether everyone else perishes with it.

By reading the laws of Augustus, who was simultaneously emancipating women (revealing that his nominal religion was dead in the water) and pressuring men to get married (revealing that men no longer wanted to marry emancipated women).
Over and over again, throughout the last two thousand years, it has been demonstrated that people who adhere to the Pauline laws on marriage reproduce at about seven live grown children per woman if there is adequate food, people who grossly deviate from these rules reproduce at slightly less than two children per woman, even if food is abundant.
Peoples that have bad marriage laws fail to reproduce and disappear from Either we replace our current state religion of progressivism with a religion that supports marriage laws that enable people to safely form families, or we get replaced by conservative Islam.
Either way, female emancipation is going, but the second way it goes because our people, our culture, and our civilization disappears.

We have multiple independent sources suggestive of a holiness spiral in Judaism at the time, consistent with the account given by Josephus and in the gospels.
When the area was ruled by Greeks, the Jewish hereditary priesthood led a revolt against Greek secularism and established a dynasty of priest kings.
The rabbis (pharisees) challenged the power of the hereditary priesthood, on the basis of being holier than thou, and part of being holier than thou was being more willing to get into suicidal war with powerful enemies, just as today's progressives are flirting with nuclear The hereditary priesthood had led the Jews into a war with powerful enemies (Greeks) and won, so the Rabbis wanted to lead the Jews into an even bigger war with even more powerful enemies (Romans plus Greeks under Roman leadership) and win.
Now that the formerly communist regimes have turned right wing, progs are today the war party.  Similarly, rabbis were the war party back in the days of Jesus and Josephus, hence the prophecies of Jesus about the fall of Jerusalem and the temple.
Thus we know from other sources that events must have been much as depicted by Jesus and Josephus.
You suggest that Josephus made up the story of being forced to suicide to justify his betrayal of his comrades, but we have independent evidence that his comrades murdered everyone, Khmer Rouge style, as over the top fanaticism spiraled into even further over the top fanaticism. If they did not attempt to force Josephus to suicide, they forced everyone like him to suicide.

Obviously Jesus the man existed.
But even if he had not existed, it is obvious that the pharisees (rabbis) were friggen crazy, generally hateful and vicious, were making, like modern social justice warriors, a power grab through claims of superior holiness, trying to out holy the traditional hereditary priesthood, and leading their people to self destruction, thus inevitably someone claiming to be a prophet of God would have arisen to call them out, and would have been executed for his troubles.
Also inevitable that that prophet, if not of the line of Aaron, would claim to be of the line of David.
The self destructiveness of today's Jews is a faint echo of the destructiveness and self destructiveness of the rabbis at that time, who got them enslaved and exiled, and their endless legalistic interpretation and re-interpretation and re-re-interpretation of the Jewish law is what got them into trouble in the first place.  If Jews had stuck with the hereditary priesthood ordained by Moses, they would not have gotten into all this trouble, nor caused all the trouble that they have caused for other peoples.
The Rabbis got their people killed, and those that were not killed were enslaved and/or exiled, but the rabbis got what they really wanted. They got power and the hereditary priesthood lost power, at the cost of destroying Jerusalem.
So of course a prophet must have existed complaining about this crap, and of course his life and words would have somewhat resembled the life attributed to Jesus, in that he would criticize the hypocrisy and legalism of the religious establishment, in particular and especially the hypocrisy and legalism of the pharisees, and would have died of it.

Little background here.  Before World War II, England, rather than America, was dominant in the anglosphere, and from the restoration of Charles the second to end of World War II, the Royal Society socially enforced the scientific method, awarding status to people who followed it, and denying status to people who failed to follow it.
The King was the fount of all honors, mortal and divine - which means his job was to regulate status competition, so that wins at status were awarded for prosocial, rather than antisocial, activity.
In the early days of the Royal Society, some people objected, objected very strongly, to status being awarded in this fashion, and organized a mob to thump those who received status in this fashion, whereupon Charles the Second sent soldiers to physically back up the Royal Society, thumping those who objected to the status awards as if they were disorderly stray dogs, treating them like beggars, gypsies, whores and thieves, punishing them in ways that reduced their status, rather than martyring them.
Thereby ensuring that he held on to the role that his father lost, as the fount of all honors mortal and divine.
And, while the Royal Society was in charge of defining and enforcing the scientific method, science agreed that saturated fat was good for you, and eating animals was good for you.
When Britain lost World War II and America won it, Harvard got the upper hand over the Royal Society, and introduced "peer review", which means that an anonymous committee of "scientists" decide official truth behind closed doors on the basis of secret evidence, rather than following the scientific method.
Since then, the output of "science" has generally been an indicator of what is high status, rather than what is supported by the evidence, saturated fats being a spectacular example of "scientists" treating evidence, experiment, and data with total contempt.
And thus the output of "science" reveals that veganism was high status until recently, but has recently lost status, because chicks now have high status, chicks like slim men with big muscles, and slim men with big muscles are invariably meat eaters.
As a result "science" is now discovering that eating tasty animals is good for you.

You don't say "Kill Jim".  You say you are terribly sad that I have this terrible mental disease that makes it regrettably necessary to kill me.
Which makes you very sad Veganism has been cool for a very long time.  Indeed, the lies on saturated fat were manufactured back in the forties to give "scientific" endorsement to veganism, much as the lies on anthropogenic global warming were manufactured to give "scientific" endorsement to demonizing the technological and industrial civilization that white people created.
Indeed, veganism has recently ceased to be cool, has fallen out of fashion, which made it possible for scientists to notice that saturated fat is actually rather healthy.
The next fashion is going to be buying a young pig, killing it oneself, washing it down with caustic potash to remove the hair, shaving it oneself, gutting it oneself, and throwing a big party around the intact pig, with head and legs all together so it still looks like an animal, roasting on a spit over hot coals.  For organic trendiness, everyone will have lots of ice cold extra fizzy recently fermented high alcohol Kombucha while waiting for the roasting to finish and the pig to be served, plus some beer, coke and mountain dew for those who are not so Further, there are no strict vegans, only vegans that eat vegetables plus milk, cheese, and eggs. The strict vegans are just status posturing.  Strict veganism will make you sick or kill you, and will result in an uncontrollable raging hunger for steak, bacon, fried chicken, and so on and so forth.  Humans are obligate omnivores.

It is impossible to go without, and anyone who says they do without is just plain lying.

Obviously, at full scale we are always going to have immensely more clients than full peers, likely by a factor of hundreds of thousands, but we need to have enough peers, which means we need to reward peers for being peers, for providing the service of storing blockchain data, propagating transactions, verifying the blockchain, and making the data readily available, rather than for the current pointless bit crunching and waste of electricity employed by current mining.
The power over the blockchain, and the revenues coming from transaction and storage fees, have to go to this large number of peers, rather than, as at present, mostly to four miners located in China.
Also, at scale, we are going to have to shard, so that a peer is actually a pool of machines, each with a shard of the blockchain, perhaps with all the machines run by one person, perhaps run by a group of people who trust each other, each of whom runs one machine managing one shard of the blockchain.
Rewards, and the decision as to which chain is final, has to go to weight of stake, but also to proof of service - to peers, who store and check the blockchain and make it available.
All durable keys should live in client wallets, because they can be secured off the internet.  So how do we implement weight of stake, since only peers are actually sufficiently well connected to actually participate in governance?
To solve this problem, stakes are held by client wallets.  Stakes that are in the clear get registered with a peer, the registration gets recorded in the blockchain, and the peer is gets influence, and to some extent rewards, proportional to the stake registered with it, conditional on the part it is doing to supply data storage, verification, and bandwidth.

There is plausible historical evidence that Jesus did not rise from the dead, nor did the sun stand still over one of the Empire's dominions, but we have ample historical evidence for Jesus the man, who was crucified by Pontius Pilate, and anyone who denies it is just stupid or If anything, we have better historical evidence for Jesus the man than Mohammed the Prophet.
In actual practice, the Church was founded by Paul, who used the conveniently dead Jesus as basis for what we now know as Christianity.
Lots of aspects of the founding myth of Christianity are improbable, and either supported only by suspiciously weak evidence, or contradicted by compellingly strong evidence, but that Jesus lived and was crucified by Pontius Pilate is undeniable by anyone half way sane.
The Jewish religion was in a holiness spiral which put them on course for a suicidal confrontation with Rome, therefore one would expect a prophet to condemn this holiness spiral in exactly the manner that Jesus is recorded as condemning it.  And one would expect a prophet who spoke the truth on this matter to get crucified.  As Jesus the man is recorded as being crucified.  This aspect of the founding myth is inherently plausible, and is supported by compellingly strong evidence.

This law keeps talking about physical locations on the physical border. The core thing it does is repeal any existing obstacles to building a wall and survieling that physical border.
The reason nation states exist is that people keep invading to help themselves to other people's stuff, as for example Jose Zarate, who came here to kill people like me and take our stuff, and has proceeded to do so with impunity.
One such man is just a criminal, but when he is backed and supported by other men in this common purpose, as he is, and thus enjoys immunity and impunity through this mutual support for violent men engaged in violent acts, he is an invasion, part of an invading army.

Are you going to concluder that Romans had no one ruling Israel at the time?
Granted, if he was God, you would expect him to have substantially more impact than Pontius Pilate, but he generated as much historical records as one would expect of yet another prophet and trouble maker in Israel.

We have very few historical records about Pontius Pilate and would expect to know even less about yet another Jewish trouble maker, of which there were a plentiful supply.  Do you doubt the existence of Pontius Pilate?
We do know the Jews were in a holiness spiral.  You would expect prophets to show up and condemn it.  You would expect such prophets to be executed - which is why the holiness spiral continued.
And you would expect such a prophet to get about as much mention in history as Jesus the man did indeed receive.

All wars are white on white wars.  Whites fight over other peoples, not with them.  Only the East Asians are competent in war, and they are still nowhere near as good at it as whites.  The Vietnam war was not really whites versus East Asians, it was really the blue empire of the consulates versus the red empire of the bases.  The Vietnamese were Soviet proxies, and the Soviets were blue empire proxies.  Without Soviet backing, State Department backing, and Democratic Party backing, the Vietnamese would have been toast.

The alliance between La Raza, Black Lives Matter, and the Democrats, resembles the alliance between the Populares and the Samnites.
The Populares and the Optimates were political parties in Roman Empire, "Populare" meaning "People's party"  The Populares corresponded to today's Democrats, the coalition of the fringes, weirdoes versus normal people, minorities versus the majority, the coalition of high and low against middle.
The Populares wanted to give the Samnites (equivalent to today's La Raza) a fairer deal within the Roman Empire.
The Samnites wanted to level the walls of Rome, kill all male Romans, and enslave all Roman women.
When civil war between the political parties, between the Optimates and the Populares ensued, the alliance between Populares and Samnites proved less than entirely helpful.

While one should avoid war with outgroups, (rule of acquisition thirty five) takes two to avoid war.
Democratic party policy is to hike tribalism up to the max, to have integration but resist assimilation.  This is a program bound to end in war, democide, and genocide.
Assimilation works, integration does not. If two tribes occupy overlapping territories, either war will ensue, or one will rule, and the other be second class and forced into submissive posture.  That is human nature.
Since tribalism is also human nature, need borders with walls backed by men with guns.
The peace of Westphalia is a general formula for peace between Kings, nations, peoples, cultures, tribes, and religions.  This social technology, one of Chesterton's many abandoned fences, needs to be revived and reapplied.
Lacking this, we are seeing increasing incidents of casual violence against white males, with those guilty getting away with it, being let off by police and judiciary.   This can only escalate.  One tribe must rule, one must submit.  The Democratic Party prescription is a prescription for genocidal and democidal war, and that war is beginning.

Irrespective of whether Jesus did in fact show up after his death, he is reported as showing up after his death, thus it is likely that his followers believed that he had shown up, and this likely caused problems for the Romans, causing Roman historians unaware that he had been crucified to also believe that he had indeed shown up.

Every peer has to download every transaction, in order to judge it for validity. If relying on someone else's claim about validity, not truly a peer.  It is having many peers that makes the network resistant to control and attack.
This inherently limits the number of transactions that can be made fully on the blockchain and fully peered to something that is not compatible with taking over the world.
Thus scalability, up to world conquering scales, requires an architecture where most people do not have peer wallets, but client wallets, and most transactions are consolidated into fewer and larger transactions by important peer wallets functioning somewhat like banks before the transactions are entered into the blockchain.

The contemporary evidence for Pontius Pilate is exactly the same as the contemporary evidence for Jesus.  Josephus was there, and he mentions both of them.
Further, it is obvious that someone resembling Pontius Pilate had to exist, because the Roman Empire dominated that region, and it is obvious that prophets resembling Jesus the man had to exist, because the rabbis were in a holiness spiral, prophets would have condemned this, and would have been executed for condemning it.

It is plausibly *suspected* that *one* of Josephus's references to Jesus is a forgery, or more likely was improved by a Christian editor.
There is no reason to doubt his other references to Jesus.
Further, we have multiple references to the disciples of Jesus. That his movement existed is undeniable.
We know that Jesus the man existed the same way we know that Pontius Pilate existed:
Someone like Jesus the man had to exist, in that the rabbis were engaged in a holiness spiral, a holiness spiral will get called out by prophets, and then those prophets get suppressed, and someone like Pontius Pilate had to exist, in that the Roman Empire ruled the area, and history records Jesus as one of those prophets, and Pontius Pilate as one of the Roman Empire's administrators.

In this, Wikipedia accurately reports the official consensus of official However, on the dating of the gospels, the the official consensus of official academia is evidently untruthful, dating the gospels to after the fall of the temple and Jerusalem, because the gospels report Jesus as prophesying the fall of the Temple and Jerusalem.

A religion is a synthetic tribe.   A state needs a tribe, and tribe needs a state.
Jewish religious tribalism was going nuts at the time, Roman paganism was dissolving in cynicism.
Also, Roman paganism had abandoned patriarchy, and as a result Romans had stopped reproducing.  Christianity retained Jewish patriarchy, so Christians were able to form families and reproduce.
Christianity is around because the state needed a religion, and because Christians had children.   Constantine founded state Christianity, which made a disintegrating state viable, and gave the state a ruling elite that was able to reproduce successfully, a program in due course imitated by Charles the Hammer, who proceeded to defeat Islam and found Today, the ruling state religion is progressivism, but progressives, like Romans when their religion became decadent, cannot reproduce, and like Jews, when their religion became ever more insane in a holiness spiral, are engaged in ever more self destructive and warlike government Thus, self destruction, which requires replacement by a sane and patriarchal state religion.
Conservative Islam is adequately patriarchal, but, absent a Calif, tends to madness.  Maybe we will make Mormonism the state religion, or perhaps import Russia's eastern Orthodoxy.

By reading the laws of Augustus, who was simultaneously emancipating women (revealing that his nominal religion was dead in the water) and pressuring men to get married (revealing that men no longer wanted to marry emancipated women).
Over and over again, throughout the last two thousand years, it has been demonstrated that people who adhere to the Pauline laws on marriage reproduce at about seven live grown children per woman if there is adequate food, people who grossly deviate from these rules reproduce at slightly less than two children per woman, even if food is abundant.
Peoples that have bad marriage laws fail to reproduce and disappear from Either we replace our current state religion of progressivism with a religion that supports marriage laws that enable people to safely form families, or we get replaced by conservative Islam.
Either way, female emancipation is going, but the second way it goes because our people, our culture, and our civilization disappears.

We have multiple independent sources suggestive of a holiness spiral in Judaism at the time, consistent with the account given by Josephus and in the gospels.
When the area was ruled by Greeks, the Jewish hereditary priesthood led a revolt against Greek secularism and established a dynasty of priest kings.
The rabbis (pharisees) challenged the power of the hereditary priesthood, on the basis of being holier than thou, and part of being holier than thou was being more willing to get into suicidal war with powerful enemies, just as today's progressives are flirting with nuclear The hereditary priesthood had led the Jews into a war with powerful enemies (Greeks) and won, so the Rabbis wanted to lead the Jews into an even bigger war with even more powerful enemies (Romans plus Greeks under Roman leadership) and win.
Now that the formerly communist regimes have turned right wing, progs are today the war party.  Similarly, rabbis were the war party back in the days of Jesus and Josephus, hence the prophecies of Jesus about the fall of Jerusalem and the temple.
Thus we know from other sources that events must have been much as depicted by Jesus and Josephus.
You suggest that Josephus made up the story of being forced to suicide to justify his betrayal of his comrades, but we have independent evidence that his comrades murdered everyone, Khmer Rouge style, as over the top fanaticism spiraled into even further over the top fanaticism. If they did not attempt to force Josephus to suicide, they forced everyone like him to suicide.

Obviously Jesus the man existed.
But even if he had not existed, it is obvious that the pharisees (rabbis) were friggen crazy, generally hateful and vicious, were making, like modern social justice warriors, a power grab through claims of superior holiness, trying to out holy the traditional hereditary priesthood, and leading their people to self destruction, thus inevitably someone claiming to be a prophet of God would have arisen to call them out, and would have been executed for his troubles.
Also inevitable that that prophet, if not of the line of Aaron, would claim to be of the line of David.
The self destructiveness of today's Jews is a faint echo of the destructiveness and self destructiveness of the rabbis at that time, who got them enslaved and exiled, and their endless legalistic interpretation and re-interpretation and re-re-interpretation of the Jewish law is what got them into trouble in the first place.  If Jews had stuck with the hereditary priesthood ordained by Moses, they would not have gotten into all this trouble, nor caused all the trouble that they have caused for other peoples.
The Rabbis got their people killed, and those that were not killed were enslaved and/or exiled, but the rabbis got what they really wanted. They got power and the hereditary priesthood lost power, at the cost of destroying Jerusalem.
So of course a prophet must have existed complaining about this crap, and of course his life and words would have somewhat resembled the life attributed to Jesus, in that he would criticize the hypocrisy and legalism of the religious establishment, in particular and especially the hypocrisy and legalism of the pharisees, and would have died of it.

Little background here.  Before World War II, England, rather than America, was dominant in the anglosphere, and from the restoration of Charles the second to end of World War II, the Royal Society socially enforced the scientific method, awarding status to people who followed it, and denying status to people who failed to follow it.
The King was the fount of all honors, mortal and divine - which means his job was to regulate status competition, so that wins at status were awarded for prosocial, rather than antisocial, activity.
In the early days of the Royal Society, some people objected, objected very strongly, to status being awarded in this fashion, and organized a mob to thump those who received status in this fashion, whereupon Charles the Second sent soldiers to physically back up the Royal Society, thumping those who objected to the status awards as if they were disorderly stray dogs, treating them like beggars, gypsies, whores and thieves, punishing them in ways that reduced their status, rather than martyring them.
Thereby ensuring that he held on to the role that his father lost, as the fount of all honors mortal and divine.
And, while the Royal Society was in charge of defining and enforcing the scientific method, science agreed that saturated fat was good for you, and eating animals was good for you.
When Britain lost World War II and America won it, Harvard got the upper hand over the Royal Society, and introduced "peer review", which means that an anonymous committee of "scientists" decide official truth behind closed doors on the basis of secret evidence, rather than following the scientific method.
Since then, the output of "science" has generally been an indicator of what is high status, rather than what is supported by the evidence, saturated fats being a spectacular example of "scientists" treating evidence, experiment, and data with total contempt.
And thus the output of "science" reveals that veganism was high status until recently, but has recently lost status, because chicks now have high status, chicks like slim men with big muscles, and slim men with big muscles are invariably meat eaters.
As a result "science" is now discovering that eating tasty animals is good for you.

Indeed, the lies on saturated fat were manufactured back in the forties to give "scientific" endorsement to veganism, much as the lies on anthropogenic global warming were manufactured to give "scientific" endorsement to demonizing the technological and industrial civilization that white people created.
Indeed, veganism has recently ceased to be cool, has fallen out of fashion, which made it possible for scientists to notice that saturated fat is actually rather healthy.
The next fashion is going to be buying a young pig, killing it oneself, washing it down with caustic potash to remove the hair, shaving it oneself, gutting it oneself, and throwing a big party around the intact pig, with head and legs all together so it still looks like an animal, roasting on a spit over hot coals.  For organic trendiness, everyone will have lots of ice cold extra fizzy recently fermented high alcohol Kombucha while waiting for the roasting to finish and the pig to be served, plus some beer, coke and mountain dew for those who are not so Further, there are no strict vegans, only vegans that eat vegetables plus milk, cheese, and eggs. The strict vegans are just status posturing.  Strict veganism will make you sick or kill you, and will result in an uncontrollable raging hunger for steak, bacon, fried chicken, and so on and so forth.  Humans are obligate omnivores.

Obviously, at full scale we are always going to have immensely more clients than full peers, likely by a factor of hundreds of thousands, but we need to have enough peers, which means we need to reward peers for being peers, for providing the service of storing blockchain data, propagating transactions, verifying the blockchain, and making the data readily available, rather than for the current pointless bit crunching and waste of electricity employed by current mining.
The power over the blockchain, and the revenues coming from transaction and storage fees, have to go to this large number of peers, rather than, as at present, mostly to four miners located in China.
Also, at scale, we are going to have to shard, so that a peer is actually a pool of machines, each with a shard of the blockchain, perhaps with all the machines run by one person, perhaps run by a group of people who trust each other, each of whom runs one machine managing one shard of the blockchain.
Rewards, and the decision as to which chain is final, has to go to weight of stake, but also to proof of service - to peers, who store and check the blockchain and make it available.
All durable keys should live in client wallets, because they can be secured off the internet.  So how do we implement weight of stake, since only peers are actually sufficiently well connected to actually participate in governance?
To solve this problem, stakes are held by client wallets.  Stakes that are in the clear get registered with a peer, the registration gets recorded in the blockchain, and the peer is gets influence, and to some extent rewards, proportional to the stake registered with it, conditional on the part it is doing to supply data storage, verification, and bandwidth.

Your reason for not having children is the exact same reason as every other childless women.  You wasted your hottest years screwing bad boys who never texted you back the morning after, and then one morning, you noticed that you had not received a nine at night booty call in a very long time.
Some of women get off the cock carousel in time, and some of them don't want to waste one minute of their youth and beauty on a husband if they can avoid it, so they leave it too late to get off the bad boy cock carousel, misjudging how long their beauty and fertility will last. (Hint, not very long at all)
Social Justice warriors have no friends, as we see proven in the news every day.  They merely have allies, who are allies only for so long as the alliance is useful.  So you have no friends, and when you are old, you will have no kin.
Television tells women that they can stay on the cock carousel forever, and when they are fat and forty a six foot six billionaire vampire king will fall madly in love with them.  And they believe it, and get upset whenever Hollywood casts a female lead who is actually hot.
Biology is that old men can still father children, but old women cannot.   So an old man can have a second time around, more children and more love, but a woman only gets one chance at it, and so many women are so busy screwing so many bad boys that they blow their one chance.

Big words:
Observe the typical prog.
Then observe the typical gun owner.
Progs do not have a chance.
Recall the altercation outside Milo's talk when the bald man with brass knuckles and a knife and the assistance of his numerous buddies attacked the short middle aged guy in a yellow hat.
The attack went on for twelve seconds before yellow hat chose to use his gun.  Facing two new adversaries in front of him, and glancing at the bald man behind him out of the corner of his eye, he pulled his gun and cleared a line of retreat with one shot.
Despite being attacked by multiple assailants for twelve seconds, one of them employing brass knuckles, he suffered no injuries that would have impaired his ability to fight or shoot, or even provoke him to draw his gun.  He only drew his gun when the bald man got additional reinforcements cutting off his line of escape.
And this is absolutely typical of every conflict I have seen.  Progs either hit and run, or they attack a dozen on one.  They are absolutely terrified of an equal fight, and with good reason to be terrified.

James A. Donald asked a stupid question:
This would be a more convincing answer if:
1.  I had ever seen progs attack without many to one odds in their favor, or without hitting and running.
2.  If all Putin supporters and Trump supporters were not deemed nazis and fascists.
3.  If the world was not full of conspicuously subhuman people artificially designated by the state as human, which people are allowed to cause problems for the real humans.
4.  If whenever subhumans harass humans, as for example Pussy Riot desecrating a Cathedral, leftists did not react as that adding to leftist status and reducing the status of regular humans.
My point being that you depict leftists as strong and powerful, and everyone else as weak and vulnerable, but leftists in action do not in actual practice act as if they feel themselves to be strong individually.   Rather they adopt the female strategy of whining and weeping a lot and claiming to be victimized.
During the Occupy protests, an Occupy mob descended upon a Koch event. One of the Koch brothers came out with three rentacops, (I don't recall exactly how many, but it was three or so) facing perhaps something like a hundred protesters, and forced them back. Protesters called for police to intervene in favor of the protesters against the Koch brother and his horribly brutal rentacops.
Leftists identify with subhumans, supposedly because they care so deeply about far away people they have never met, but they identify primarily when subhumans do bad things to regular humans.

Fair enough.  If it is war you want, there are plenty of reasons.
Commies murdered about a hundred million.  Nazis have murdered about
eleven million. Surely it is a lot more important to kill commies like
you than Nazis.
     At Odessa the Cheka tied White officers to planks and slowly fed
     them into furnaces or tanks of boiling water; in Kharkiv,
     scalpings and hand-flayings were commonplace: the skin was peeled
     off victims’ hands to produce “gloves”; the Voronezh Cheka rolled
     naked people around in barrels studded internally with nails;
     victims were crucified or stoned to death at Dnipropetrovsk; the
     Cheka at Kremenchuk impaled members of the clergy and buried alive
     rebelling peasants; in Orel, water was poured on naked prisoners
     bound in the winter streets until they became living ice statues;
     in Kiev, Chinese Cheka detachments placed rats in iron tubes
     sealed at one end with wire netting and the other placed against
     the body of a prisoner, with the tubes being heated until the rats
     gnawed through the victim’s body in an effort to escape.
     Executions took place in prison cellars or courtyards, or
     occasionally on the outskirts of town, during the Red Terror and
     Russian Civil War. After the condemned were stripped of their
     clothing and other belongings, which were shared among the Cheka
     executioners, they were either machine-gunned in batches or
     dispatched individually with a revolver.
     Those killed in prison were usually shot in the back of the neck
     as they entered the execution cellar, which became littered with
     corpses and soaked with blood. Victims killed outside the town
     were moved by truck, bound and gagged, to their place of
     execution, where they sometimes were made to dig their own graves.
     According to Edvard Radzinsky, “it became a common practice to
     take a husband hostage and wait for his wife to come and purchase
     his life with her body.” During Decossackization, there were
     massacres, according to historian Robert Gellately, “on an unheard
     of scale”. The Pyatigorsk Cheka organized a “day of Red Terror” to
     execute 300 people in one day, and took quotas from each part of
     town. According to the Chekist Karl Lander, the Cheka in
     Kislovodsk, “for lack of a better idea,” killed all the patients
     in the hospital.
     In October 1920 alone more than 6,000 people were executed.
     Gellately adds that Communist leaders “sought to justify their
     ethnic-based massacres by incorporating them into the rubric of
     the ‘class struggle'”.
     Members of the clergy were subjected to particularly brutal abuse.
     According to documents cited by the late Alexander Yakovlev, then
     head of the Presidential Committee for the Rehabilitation of
     Victims of Political Repression, priests, monks and nuns were
     crucified, thrown into cauldrons of boiling tar, scalped,
     strangled, given Communion with melted lead and drowned in holes
     in the ice. An estimated 3,000 were put to death in 1918 alone.
  And, of course, there is the Haitian revolt.
All whites in Haiti were murdered, presaging what is likely when
America becomes nonwhite majority.
All commies should be killed, preferably dropping them into the
Pacific ocean from helicopters.  After that, we prohibit Jews,
nonwhites, women, people who do not own land, and people who are not
legally entitled to bear arms from voting or holding any government or
quasi government office which involves exercising authority over adult
white males.
You want war?  We shall see who wins.

It is the Will of god that they kill infidels and rape infidel women.
Their family, their society, and their mosque supports them in so doing, whereas if they were to kill fellow Muslims in their home town, their mosque would be mighty pissed about it.
It is the duty of Muslims to wage war on infidels until the enemy is subdued.  When you have only a few Muslims, it is possible to interpret this as crime, but when the proportion of Muslims reaches about thirty percent, it becomes rather obvious that it is war, and must be dealt by military means, rather than police means.
That means you have to use the laws of war - the old laws of war, that allow for collective punishment of hostile enemy populations and similar martial law type solutions.

Adbusters advocates for a communist command economy.  During the twentieth century, all mass murders, including the Nazi mass murders, were associated with, and arguably the result of command economies.
The Nazi mass murders were not so much the result of racism, as the command economy.  The initial plan of the Nazis was to deport the Jews to anywhere that would take them, including and especially Israel.  They had a large bureaucracy for helping Jews through other country's bureaucracies.  But other countries obstructed this program. At the same time, Germany developed the standard command economy food shortages, as Venezuela and North Korea have today, and decided to deal with this by prioritizing feeding some people over feeding other people -  Jews not being the only group de-prioritized, thus Nazi mass murders were in practice very similar to communist mass murders.
The Tides foundation also used to support terrorism and mass murder in Syria, and for all I know still does.

Meryl menaced by the Trump terror. Again…
Spectator - By Arthur Chrenkoff
A few weeks after her moral preening and posturing at the Golden Globes, when she portrayed herself and her fellow jet-setting Hollywood millionaires as the most vilified section of American society, Meryl Streep’s new “poor me” violin concerto has tugged at the left’s heartstrings once again – this time at Waldorf Astoria in New York, during her acceptance of the National Ally for Equality Award from the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues.
It’s terrifying to put the target on your forehead, and it sets you up for all sorts of attacks and armies of brownshirts and bots and worse, and the only way you can do it is to feel you have to. You have to. You don’t have an option. You have to.”As she insistently told the appreciative audience.
Who and where are these brownshirts, you might wonder, as I do too. Has Trump set up some sort of a new paramilitary force of thug-supporters to harass and beat up his political opponents, shut down public events he disagrees with, and set fires and smash things in orgies of senseless violence? So far, all this and more is being done by the self-described anti-Trump “anti-fascists”. So quite possibly when Ms Streep complains about brownshirts she really just means people who disagree with her political and cultural views…..
….. I might have more sympathy for Meryl Streep if her Waldorf Astoria appearance was shut down by hundreds of black-clad masked protesters who beat up and pepper sprayed the unfortunate attendees and set fire to the venue. But that stuff only seems to happen to Milo. Perhaps he should check his fascist privilege.

In fact even the real original Nazis did not openly deny anyone's right to exist.  Their original plan was to deport the Jews to anywhere that would take them, in particular and especially Israel, and they created a large bureaucracy to interface with other countries bureaucracies to grease the tracks and persuade other countries to take them.  But other countries aggressively obstructed this program of deportation.
When, due to socialism, they found they did not have enough food to go around they furtively and secretively decided to exterminate the Jews - a decision that bears a striking resemblance to the much larger democides committed by communists, such as yourself.
Had the Nazis won, then they would be the high status academic  and official media sources that Wikipedia deems reliable, and you would read in all the history books and in Wikipedia that no Holocaust took place, and the Jews were in fact all deported except for a few trouble making terrorists who got shot.  Also, no mention of any food shortage. National Socialism would supposedly be a complete economic success, much as North American GDP continues to supposedly rise even though the average male salary and median male salary buys substantially fewer cars and substantially fewer loafs of bread than it did in 1972, not to mention enormously less of the years in college required to get a decent job, even though a normal person used to be able to get a doctor to call when his child was sick and today he cannot.

But blacks, with great regularity, do chimp out, sometimes even upper class black professors at Ivy League universities chimp out, whereas "nazis" do not.
So, by observed bad deeds, seems more logical to engage in violence against blacks, Muslims, and commies, than against "nazis".

I see blacks chimping out.  I don't see nazis burning synagogues. I see Muslims burning synagogues, however.
An observer who watches the video closely will note a subtle absence of furtiveness in the assailants. There is an almost perceptible insouciance in live streaming a kidnapping under your own account name while revealing your own smiling faces. These are the kind of clues law enforcement personnel are trained to detect.
There’s a reason for such blithe unconcern. The obvious one is the culprits plainly did not see themselves as doing anything wrong which would necessitate concealment of their identities. That’s probably correct, but not the most correct.
The four age irrelevant teens weren’t at all wrestling with moral dilemmas they could barely process even where choices are stark. Rather, they were responding to a perceived set of rewards and punishment–stimulus and reinforcement.
The kidnappers chose to commit and openly advertise their crime because they believed doing so would produce a net emotional reward. By their own alleged account, they wanted the video to go viral. Whether considering incarceration or not, they plainly anticipated positive acclaim from publicly injuring and debasing a white man. This is a learned behavior.
American Teens have been indoctrinated to believe that whites don’t exist as beings of moral value, but rather totems of their own squalid inadequacies. Black woes always have a white face. And so what exactly is wrong with carving a small piece of that face off for posterity?
This idea is reinforced by all respectable information channels with increasing directness. Those channels that dissent are exhaustively examined for links to a defunct German political party. Regardless, when such seeds are planted in shallow intellectual soil where very few ethical qualms grow, yesterday’s event becomes surprising only in its poor quality of camerawork.
But it’s not just that these perpetrators are dumb, it is that their dumbness is intentionally exploited. Even the dullest whites quickly digest that if they so much as subject a black to faint praise an avalanche of condemnation and legal recriminations await. That doesn’t mean whites never attack blacks, it means such actions are inhibited by extreme disincentives. In contrast, blacks learn that attacking whites typically earns acclaim on Worldstar, a winking shrug from the media, possibly a hagiographic Hollywood film, and if nothing else tenure at the University of Wisconsin.
This week in Chicagoland, four Feral-Americans — two males and two females — kidnapped and tortured, live on film uploaded to Facebook, a mentally disabled White 18 year old man, cackling gleefully as they had him drink toilet water, nearly scalped him, and made him recite “Fuck Trump” and “Fuck White people”. The kidnapping and torture dragged on for nearly two days. One of the HBzeroes, Brittany Herring, narrated the torture-fest. It’s as chimptastic as you’d surmise.
YouTube scrubbed the video.
NPR refused to identify the races involved.
CNN ignored it (until late today), and finally confronted the story with a bunch of shitlib talking heads fretting over ten heavily-edited seconds of a thirty minute video.
The Chicago police chief jupmed ahead of the message machine and said it wasn’t a hate crime
If the Chicago kidnapping races were reversed, about seven Hollywood films would currently be in pre-production.
The reason white shitlibs excuse or sugarcoat the depraved violence of blacks is because they don’t really believe blacks have moral agency. And frankly, they’re right. ...
White shitlibs are undergoing a heretical threat to their religion like none they’ve experienced before; and you know from history that when a zealot is cornered and disillusioned, and his icons thrown to the ground, he will lash out in rage and demand the heads of the infidels.
the root cause is a generation of anti-white (and anti-Christian, etc.) propaganda put out by the Cathedral. Before a child even starts Kindergarten, they are taught these messages on TV, a soft form of inclusiveness and diversity that is later flipped to "white man the devil" if not before, then when they are in university. This propaganda is increasingly hateful as time goes by because Cthulhu swims left, but also because the population of minorities is growing and creating their own narratives.
Americans are reminded of the evils of lynching in the past, which of course always involved sweet innocent black victims. No, no they did not. Just look at the news records of two I wrote about here and posted the newspaper account. Many were of men guilty of crimes. Those were not for fun.
Now look at the Chiraq 4 and what they did. Detained a special needs white guy for being white, tortured, beat and mocked him. This is like a lynching. All of those "geez, wrong place wrong time" murders that people shake their heads at are modern day lynchings. Media would never call them that but what is it when someone simply takes a wrong turn and they get robbed, raped and murdered for being in the wrong neighborhood? Hollywood will have a white guy say, "Don't come 'round here boy" to some black teen in a spiffy outfit. Blacks will flip out when a white even puts the term 'boy' in a tweet in any way related to a black, yet this attack is not racial. Would Hollywood ever recreate the Knoxville horror? Of course not.

If you guys had some real hate crimes committed by non Jewish white males, you would not be reduced to making so much shit up.  There has been a flood of supposed white male hate crimes against women, blacks, and Jews since the election of Trump, and every one committed in the United States has been a hoax.
But I see huge numbers of entirely real hate crimes committed by non whites and feminists.
The Jewish problem is rather like the Muslim problem.  Not all Muslims are terrorists, but the vast majority of terrorists are Muslims, and similarly not all Jews instigate hate crimes, but if you hear anyone teaching dim witted people to commit hate crimes against whites, he is usually a sharp witted Jew.
Notice that most of the outrage about Trump turning Muslim asylum seekers away comes from people who conspicuously fail to be outraged by Israel turning Muslim asylum seekers away.
Of course they are not all hypocrites:  Soros wants Israel destroyed and Israelis murdered as much as he wants America destroyed and white Americans murdered.  On the whole I prefer the hypocrites.
Trumps ingenious tactic of giving the Jews recognition of Jerusalem but taking away the holocaust tends to split the Jewish hypocrites, so that some of them stop calling for the destruction of America, thus becoming consistent, and some of them start calling for the destruction of Israel, thus becoming consistent.

All of your Black Lives Matter stories involve blacks behaving badly in ways that made it reasonable for cops - or indeed anyone - to shoot them.
Blacks are used to their violence being indulged and overlooked, especially when they engage in violence against whites, and sooner or later they get violent with a man with a gun.  Bad idea.  Every Black lives matter incident is a rerun of George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin.
Michael Brown is a typical example.  Walking down the middle of the road after robbing a convenience store, confronts a cop for no sane reason, just for the hell of it. Unsurprisingly gets shot while attacking the cop.  And then there was that boy with the highly realistic pellet gun, who is probably whom you are thinking of when you say "shot on camera". Bad idea to shoot cops for the hell of it even with a pellet gun.
I did say in the United States and after the Trump election.  You have to sweep all of history and the entire world to find white hate crimes, whereas black hate crimes against whites happen every day in every black majority neighborhood, and no one pays attention.
Similarly, if you look at cases where a white murders a black (not a white cop, an ordinary white drug dealer or gangster) the black is almost always committing a felony at the time he was shot.  There is about one killing per year of non feloneous blacks by whites, while there are roughly three hundred killings per year of non feloneous whites by blacks.
Black people in the United States are more likely to be victims of violent confrontations with police officers than whites because they commit more violent crimes than whites.  In 2013, black criminals carried out 38% of murders, compared to 31.1% for whites, but despite that more than twice as many white people were killed by police, indicating that a white criminal is at far higher risk of being killed in a confrontation with police than a black criminal - presumably because cops know that any time they defend themselves against vicious subhuman thugs, they will get the Black Lives Matter treatment.

For no apparent reason, he confronted the cop, and then assaulted the cop, who after a remarkable display of wild and incompetent shooting, finally managed to kill his assailant.
Maybe he thought the cop was going to charge him with stealing the cigars, but in fact the cop was at the time unaware that Michael Brown had just committed a crime.

I remarked earlier that several security proposals would not in practice be useful because Hillary's main security concern was not the Russians stealing her emails, not Wikileaks stealing her emails, not the Chans stealing her emails, but Obama stealing her emails.
Similarly, it is clear that if Trump had a chat with Assad of Syria clearing a bombing run Isis in Syria, his target list would appear in the New York Times, as he bitterly complained in his latest press Indeed this appears to be what has already happened with the Trump's raid on Al Qaeda in Yemen - the information wound up in the hands of Al Qaeda, probably by the State Department electronically intercepting Trump and Pentagon communications and then leaking the information to their pet "Moderate Islamic Opposition" aka Al Qaeda and Islamic State, and as a result several American commandos were killed or wounded.  They got killed as a result of conflict between the red empire of the bases and the blue empire of the consulates.
It very much looks as if Chief Petty Officer William "Ryan" Owens was killed as a result of people in the US government leaking information to the enemies of Americans.  Trump in his recent news conference reports his phone calls are being listened into by his enemies and then made public, so the leak mechanism in the Yemen case was likely similar.
This is far from being the first deadly conflict between the red and blue empires, though the internal conflict within the US government looks to be escalating massively under Trump.
In general, your biggest spying threat is from people mighty close to you.
I am not worried about the CIA spying on me. I am worried about them spying on Trump.
To solve this problem, we need end to end encryption with the keys on your own device.  And we need everyone using by default and standard, so that Hillary's not very bright people and Trumps menials use it when communicating with Hillary and Trump.  Which means all proposals that require managing their own keys are not going to work.
For Hillary's people to use it, it needs to be so standard that even people arranging assignations on Facebook use it without being aware of it.  That is why proprietary usb dongles will not work.
It is unlikely that Trump would manage his own public keys - and he cannot trust the white house staff and government security people to manage them for him.  It is even more unlikely that Podesta would manage his own public keys.  So we need a security mechanism for the masses, a security mechanism that even the Chairman of the Board can use, a security mechanism suitable for everyone in the world, a security mechanism that requires zero clicks.

Ipsec is not very secure.  What I was thinking of is a global database linking phone numbers, email addresses, etc, to public keys with a witness mechanism to ensure that every client gets told the same story as to which public key is associated with which phone number.
So if your client looks up its own public key by phone number, it sees a hash chain connecting that association to the global witness hash, and knows that client it is talking to sees the same public key.  Clients upload and download public keys at infrequent intervals without human This works fine with phones, since people assume one phone number per physical phone.  Phone forwarding systems are assumed to forward from one phone number/physical device to another phone number physical device. Not so fine with email addresses. Just have to give people the 'Your emails are currently encrypted so that they can only be read on the following physical devices ...
"Add current device to list for future emails?"
"Edit list of devices that are empowered to decrypt your email?"
Which interface is likely to confuse and irritate them.
And if you lose or damage the physical device that currently holds all your old emails and you have not backed it up recently, thus losing all your old emails and the secret key that can decrypt them - that could be very handy if an investigation is coming up.

Illegally employing her own email server was an anti Obama security measure, not an anti Wikileaks or anti Chan measure.  She would have been more secure against Wikileaks, the Chans, and the Russians, had she done the legal thing and used the official government (aka Obama) controlled mail server.
Similarly, Google ratting out Petraeus to Obama has caused a sudden and striking disinclination to use Gmail among persons of interest.
Of course Assad would not - but the State Department is supporting Isis, and would.  And someone in the government, probably the CIA or the State Department did leak the equivalent info about the raid in Yemen to Al Qaeda, resulting in many injuries and a death.
I totally support Assad.  He stands between the US State Department, and the genocide of all Alawites, Christians, and all Shiites of Palestinian descent in Syria.  The State Department aims to do to Alawites in Syria what it did to Tutsis in the Congo, and a side effect that they do not much care about or rather like is that Christians in Syria would get genocided also.
Al Qaeda tells us that they knew what was coming.  So chances are that the site *became* well defended shortly after the decision to attack it was made.
There is a tendency to analyze security as if your home computer was secure, which it is not. But the error of analyzing security as if your organization was secure and cohesive is a greater error.  Trump is at far greater risk of being spied on by the CIA and the State Department than the Russians, and the consequences of that spying are more severe. Similarly, Hillary was primarily concerned about Obama spying on her, and was right to be concerned.  Petraeus should have been similarly So security really has to be in the hands of the end user, rather than the organization.  Trump, Hillary, Podesta, Petraeus, and the Chairman of the Board are never going to use PGP, or even correctly use browser Certification Authorities.  Podesta and Hillary's information technology guy did not seem to know what a website certificate is, or how it works.

If a Muslim is not murdering infidels, and raping children, he is a bad Muslim.

Christians spread their religion by getting non Christians to celebrate Christmas and then wishing them "Happy Christmas".  Muslims spread their religion by cutting off people's heads and enslaving enemy women.

We also see that thee interpretations of statistics that come up with reassuring pieties, interpretations of statistics that tell us Sweden is doing fine, are evasive, avoid presenting the data we are genuinely interested in, namely, Sweden's extraordinarily high rape rate, and what proportion of Sweden's extraordinarily high rape rate is the result of rapes by military age Muslims entering as refugee/asylum "children".

Revealed preference, female behavior, suggests that female emancipation was a shit test that white Christian males failed, and that conservative Muslim males passed.

Till did not deserve to be killed for whistling at her, but today it often enough happens that people are killed for similar acts.
I was in an elevator with a young lady.  A man said "Hello" to that lady and smiled at her.  I placed my hand on her shoulder and stared at him expressionlessly and silently.  From his reaction I am pretty sure he feared I was going to kill him, even though my expression was totally neutral, blank, and stone faced.
Because people do get killed for that sort of thing today.  Race has nothing to do with it.  That was a murder, not a lynching, and similar murders happen today all the time.
The Tulsa massacre was the murder of ten white men by racist blacks, followed by whites ethnically cleansing the infestation of dangerous blacks from their town.
A black man assaulted a white woman.  He was arrested.
Believing he was likely to be lynched a group of 75 armed blacks went to the courthouse and politely asked that he be secured to receive a fair trial - the white sheriff told them he would receive a fair trial and politely asked them to go home.
These seventy five armed black men confronted a large group of white men in a predominantly white area, some of them armed, who they suspected intended to lynch the black youth who had assaulted a white woman.  The blacks opened fire, killing ten of the white men.
In short, blacks started it, and whites finished it.
If the whites had actually grabbed the youth from the courthouse you would have a point.  But the blacks opened fire on suspicion that the whites might grab the youth from the courthouse, which is much the same thing as blacks lynching whites on vague suspicion, and very different from whites lynching blacks on vague suspicion.

Assault weapons were named by Hitler (or at least he signed off on the name), "Sturmgewehr", literally "Storm gun, Sturm gewehr" because unlike the considerably heavier guns of World War I, designed to be fired while kneeling in a trench, they were designed to be fired while running towards your enemies, while storming the enemy.
In consequence an assault rifle makes an excellent hunting weapon for a seven year old girl, but adult males generally prefer considerably more powerful guns for hunting, unless they are varmint shooting.
A small child using an assault rifle to hunt usually shoots while kneeling or lying down, and resting the front of the rifle on something, because the weight and recoil makes it difficult for a small child to aim while walking around.

Almost every technological advance that is brought to the masses comes from someone like Rockefeller, who improved refineries, rapidly reducing the price of refined fuel from thirty cents a gallon down to eight cents a gallon.
And every technological advance is brought to the masses by someone like For example, transistors, invented by Shockley, brought to the masses by Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory.  Shockley founded Silicon Valley. The Traitorous Eight learned how to build transistors directly from him and under him, and then, pissed off by his poor interpersonal skills, went on to found Fairchild.
Only to have the same thing happen to them, resulting in the Fairchildren and the integrated circuit and Silicon Valley.
Every modern electronic device everywhere comes from someone who learned to build transistors at the feet of someone who learned to build transistors at the feet of someone who learned to build transistors at the feet of Shockley in Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory.
Rockefeller did not invent refining, but he invented the modern type oil refinery, making it large scale, efficient, and cheap.  Shockley did invent the junction transistor, and did invent the theory and explanation of transistors.  He literally wrote the book, and every transistor everywhere, except for the early crystal radios, every transistor that people use today, is built by people who learned from people who learned from people who learned from him in personal apprenticeship, the boss telling his employees how to produce the goods and personally showing them how to do so with his own hands.

If you were familiar with alt-right and neoreactionary thought, you would know what he means.
Here is what he means:
Science largely stopped progressing shortly after World War II.  It has become a priesthood in lab coats.  Peer Review is the priesthood at synod, conspiring behind closed doors to develop a uniform party line. Instead of experimentalists telling us what they see, they are told what they will see.
Technology in West largely stopped progressing after 1972.
Compare, for example "Freedom Tower" with the Two Towers.  Its highest inhabitable floor is substantially smaller and lower than the highest inhabited floor of the two towers, and it just looks ugly, unimpressive, and sadly early twentieth century, a little bit old fashioned.  Our fastest fighter planes have smarter electronics, but they fly slower, do not fly so high, and are less maneuverable.
Technology continues to progress in East Asia, though slowly, for example ever better phone screens, LED lighting, higher energy density batteries, and so on and so forth. Which is odd, since even East Asians agree that East Asians are uncreative and need white leadership to achieve technological advance.  Why are white people, who have always led the world, taking a back seat?
Maybe the same reason as our testosterone levels and sperm counts are falling catastrophically.  Remember what happened to rocket scientist Matt Taylor.

Indeed, what a corporate raider does to a business, is what Trump is doing to the permanent government of the US.

Despite being attacked by multiple assailants for twelve seconds, one of them employing brass knuckles, he suffered no injuries that would have impaired his ability to fight or shoot, or even provoke him to draw his gun.  He only drew his gun when the bald man got additional reinforcements cutting off his line of escape.
And this is absolutely typical of every conflict I have seen.  Progs either hit and run, or they attack a dozen on one.  They are absolutely terrified of an equal fight, and with good reason to be terrified.

James A. Donald asked a stupid question:
This would be a more convincing answer if:
1.  I had ever seen progs attack without many to one odds in their favor, or without hitting and running.
2.  If all Putin supporters and Trump supporters were not deemed nazis and fascists.
3.  If the world was not full of conspicuously subhuman people artificially designated by the state as human, which people are allowed to cause problems for the real humans.
4.  If whenever subhumans harass humans, as for example Pussy Riot desecrating a Cathedral, leftists did not react as that adding to leftist status and reducing the status of regular humans.
My point being that you depict leftists as strong and powerful, and everyone else as weak and vulnerable, but leftists in action do not in actual practice act as if they feel themselves to be strong individually.   Rather they adopt the female strategy of whining and weeping a lot and claiming to be victimized.
During the Occupy protests, an Occupy mob descended upon a Koch event. One of the Koch brothers came out with three rentacops, (I don't recall exactly how many, but it was three or so) facing perhaps something like a hundred protesters, and forced them back. Protesters called for police to intervene in favor of the protesters against the Koch brother and his horribly brutal rentacops.
Leftists identify with subhumans, supposedly because they care so deeply about far away people they have never met, but they identify primarily when subhumans do bad things to regular humans.

Fair enough.  If it is war you want, there are plenty of reasons.
Commies murdered about a hundred million.  Nazis have murdered about
eleven million. Surely it is a lot more important to kill commies like
you than Nazis.
     At Odessa the Cheka tied White officers to planks and slowly fed
     them into furnaces or tanks of boiling water; in Kharkiv,
     scalpings and hand-flayings were commonplace: the skin was peeled
     off victims’ hands to produce “gloves”; the Voronezh Cheka rolled
     naked people around in barrels studded internally with nails;
     victims were crucified or stoned to death at Dnipropetrovsk; the
     Cheka at Kremenchuk impaled members of the clergy and buried alive
     rebelling peasants; in Orel, water was poured on naked prisoners
     bound in the winter streets until they became living ice statues;
     in Kiev, Chinese Cheka detachments placed rats in iron tubes
     sealed at one end with wire netting and the other placed against
     the body of a prisoner, with the tubes being heated until the rats
     gnawed through the victim’s body in an effort to escape.
     Executions took place in prison cellars or courtyards, or
     occasionally on the outskirts of town, during the Red Terror and
     Russian Civil War. After the condemned were stripped of their
     clothing and other belongings, which were shared among the Cheka
     executioners, they were either machine-gunned in batches or
     dispatched individually with a revolver.
     Those killed in prison were usually shot in the back of the neck
     as they entered the execution cellar, which became littered with
     corpses and soaked with blood. Victims killed outside the town
     were moved by truck, bound and gagged, to their place of
     execution, where they sometimes were made to dig their own graves.
     According to Edvard Radzinsky, “it became a common practice to
     take a husband hostage and wait for his wife to come and purchase
     his life with her body.” During Decossackization, there were
     massacres, according to historian Robert Gellately, “on an unheard
     of scale”. The Pyatigorsk Cheka organized a “day of Red Terror” to
     execute 300 people in one day, and took quotas from each part of
     town. According to the Chekist Karl Lander, the Cheka in
     Kislovodsk, “for lack of a better idea,” killed all the patients
     in the hospital.
     In October 1920 alone more than 6,000 people were executed.
     Gellately adds that Communist leaders “sought to justify their
     ethnic-based massacres by incorporating them into the rubric of
     the ‘class struggle'”.
     Members of the clergy were subjected to particularly brutal abuse.
     According to documents cited by the late Alexander Yakovlev, then
     head of the Presidential Committee for the Rehabilitation of
     Victims of Political Repression, priests, monks and nuns were
     crucified, thrown into cauldrons of boiling tar, scalped,
     strangled, given Communion with melted lead and drowned in holes
     in the ice. An estimated 3,000 were put to death in 1918 alone.
  And, of course, there is the Haitian revolt.
All whites in Haiti were murdered, presaging what is likely when
America becomes nonwhite majority.
All commies should be killed, preferably dropping them into the
Pacific ocean from helicopters.  After that, we prohibit Jews,
nonwhites, women, people who do not own land, and people who are not
legally entitled to bear arms from voting or holding any government or
quasi government office which involves exercising authority over adult
white males.

It is the Will of god that they kill infidels and rape infidel women.
Their family, their society, and their mosque supports them in so doing, whereas if they were to kill fellow Muslims in their home town, their mosque would be mighty pissed about it.
It is the duty of Muslims to wage war on infidels until the enemy is subdued.  When you have only a few Muslims, it is possible to interpret this as crime, but when the proportion of Muslims reaches about thirty percent, it becomes rather obvious that it is war, and must be dealt by military means, rather than police means.
That means you have to use the laws of war - the old laws of war, that allow for collective punishment of hostile enemy populations and similar martial law type solutions.

Adbusters advocates for a communist command economy.  During the twentieth century, all mass murders, including the Nazi mass murders, were associated with, and arguably the result of command economies.
The Nazi mass murders were not so much the result of racism, as the command economy.  The initial plan of the Nazis was to deport the Jews to anywhere that would take them, including and especially Israel.  They had a large bureaucracy for helping Jews through other country's bureaucracies.  But other countries obstructed this program. At the same time, Germany developed the standard command economy food shortages, as Venezuela and North Korea have today, and decided to deal with this by prioritizing feeding some people over feeding other people -  Jews not being the only group de-prioritized, thus Nazi mass murders were in practice very similar to communist mass murders.

Meryl menaced by the Trump terror. Again…
Spectator - By Arthur Chrenkoff
A few weeks after her moral preening and posturing at the Golden Globes, when she portrayed herself and her fellow jet-setting Hollywood millionaires as the most vilified section of American society, Meryl Streep’s new “poor me” violin concerto has tugged at the left’s heartstrings once again – this time at Waldorf Astoria in New York, during her acceptance of the National Ally for Equality Award from the Human Rights Campaign, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender issues.
It’s terrifying to put the target on your forehead, and it sets you up for all sorts of attacks and armies of brownshirts and bots and worse, and the only way you can do it is to feel you have to. You have to. You don’t have an option. You have to.”As she insistently told the appreciative audience.
Who and where are these brownshirts, you might wonder, as I do too. Has Trump set up some sort of a new paramilitary force of thug-supporters to harass and beat up his political opponents, shut down public events he disagrees with, and set fires and smash things in orgies of senseless violence? So far, all this and more is being done by the self-described anti-Trump “anti-fascists”. So quite possibly when Ms Streep complains about brownshirts she really just means people who disagree with her political and cultural views…..
….. I might have more sympathy for Meryl Streep if her Waldorf Astoria appearance was shut down by hundreds of black-clad masked protesters who beat up and pepper sprayed the unfortunate attendees and set fire to the venue. But that stuff only seems to happen to Milo. Perhaps he should check his fascist privilege.

In fact even the real original Nazis did not openly deny anyone's right to exist.  Their original plan was to deport the Jews to anywhere that would take them, in particular and especially Israel, and they created a large bureaucracy to interface with other countries bureaucracies to grease the tracks and persuade other countries to take them.  But other countries aggressively obstructed this program of deportation.
When, due to socialism, they found they did not have enough food to go around they furtively and secretively decided to exterminate the Jews - a decision that bears a striking resemblance to the much larger democides committed by communists, such as yourself.
Had the Nazis won, then they would be the high status academic  and official media sources that Wikipedia deems reliable, and you would read in all the history books and in Wikipedia that no Holocaust took place, and the Jews were in fact all deported except for a few trouble making terrorists who got shot.  Also, no mention of any food shortage. National Socialism would supposedly be a complete economic success, much as North American GDP continues to supposedly rise even though the average male salary and median male salary buys substantially fewer cars and substantially fewer loafs of bread than it did in 1972, not to mention enormously less of the years in college required to get a decent job, even though a normal person used to be able to get a doctor to call when his child was sick and today he cannot.

But blacks, with great regularity, do chimp out, sometimes even upper class black professors at Ivy League universities chimp out, whereas "nazis" do not.
So, by observed bad deeds, seems more logical to engage in violence against blacks, Muslims, and commies, than against "nazis".
Actual real commies abound.  No actual real nazis are to be found anywhere.  And real commies have murdered ten times as many people than real nazis.

I see blacks chimping out.  I don't see nazis burning synagogues. I see Muslims burning synagogues, however.
An observer who watches the video closely will note a subtle absence of furtiveness in the assailants. There is an almost perceptible insouciance in live streaming a kidnapping under your own account name while revealing your own smiling faces. These are the kind of clues law enforcement personnel are trained to detect.
There’s a reason for such blithe unconcern. The obvious one is the culprits plainly did not see themselves as doing anything wrong which would necessitate concealment of their identities. That’s probably correct, but not the most correct.
The four age irrelevant teens weren’t at all wrestling with moral dilemmas they could barely process even where choices are stark. Rather, they were responding to a perceived set of rewards and punishment–stimulus and reinforcement.
The kidnappers chose to commit and openly advertise their crime because they believed doing so would produce a net emotional reward. By their own alleged account, they wanted the video to go viral. Whether considering incarceration or not, they plainly anticipated positive acclaim from publicly injuring and debasing a white man. This is a learned behavior.
American Teens have been indoctrinated to believe that whites don’t exist as beings of moral value, but rather totems of their own squalid inadequacies. Black woes always have a white face. And so what exactly is wrong with carving a small piece of that face off for posterity?
This idea is reinforced by all respectable information channels with increasing directness. Those channels that dissent are exhaustively examined for links to a defunct German political party. Regardless, when such seeds are planted in shallow intellectual soil where very few ethical qualms grow, yesterday’s event becomes surprising only in its poor quality of camerawork.
But it’s not just that these perpetrators are dumb, it is that their dumbness is intentionally exploited. Even the dullest whites quickly digest that if they so much as subject a black to faint praise an avalanche of condemnation and legal recriminations await. That doesn’t mean whites never attack blacks, it means such actions are inhibited by extreme disincentives. In contrast, blacks learn that attacking whites typically earns acclaim on Worldstar, a winking shrug from the media, possibly a hagiographic Hollywood film, and if nothing else tenure at the University of Wisconsin.
This week in Chicagoland, four Feral-Americans — two males and two females — kidnapped and tortured, live on film uploaded to Facebook, a mentally disabled White 18 year old man, cackling gleefully as they had him drink toilet water, nearly scalped him, and made him recite “Fuck Trump” and “Fuck White people”. The kidnapping and torture dragged on for nearly two days. One of the HBzeroes, Brittany Herring, narrated the torture-fest. It’s as chimptastic as you’d surmise.
YouTube scrubbed the video.
NPR refused to identify the races involved.
CNN ignored it (until late today), and finally confronted the story with a bunch of shitlib talking heads fretting over ten heavily-edited seconds of a thirty minute video.
The Chicago police chief jupmed ahead of the message machine and said it wasn’t a hate crime
If the Chicago kidnapping races were reversed, about seven Hollywood films would currently be in pre-production.
The reason white shitlibs excuse or sugarcoat the depraved violence of blacks is because they don’t really believe blacks have moral agency. And frankly, they’re right. ...
White shitlibs are undergoing a heretical threat to their religion like none they’ve experienced before; and you know from history that when a zealot is cornered and disillusioned, and his icons thrown to the ground, he will lash out in rage and demand the heads of the infidels.
the root cause is a generation of anti-white (and anti-Christian, etc.) propaganda put out by the Cathedral. Before a child even starts Kindergarten, they are taught these messages on TV, a soft form of inclusiveness and diversity that is later flipped to "white man the devil" if not before, then when they are in university. This propaganda is increasingly hateful as time goes by because Cthulhu swims left, but also because the population of minorities is growing and creating their own narratives.
Americans are reminded of the evils of lynching in the past, which of course always involved sweet innocent black victims. No, no they did not. Just look at the news records of two I wrote about here and posted the newspaper account. Many were of men guilty of crimes. Those were not for fun.
Now look at the Chiraq 4 and what they did. Detained a special needs white guy for being white, tortured, beat and mocked him. This is like a lynching. All of those "geez, wrong place wrong time" murders that people shake their heads at are modern day lynchings. Media would never call them that but what is it when someone simply takes a wrong turn and they get robbed, raped and murdered for being in the wrong neighborhood? Hollywood will have a white guy say, "Don't come 'round here boy" to some black teen in a spiffy outfit. Blacks will flip out when a white even puts the term 'boy' in a tweet in any way related to a black, yet this attack is not racial. Would Hollywood ever recreate the Knoxville horror? Of course not.

If you guys had some real hate crimes committed by non Jewish white males, you would not be reduced to making so much shit up.  There has been a flood of supposed white male hate crimes against women, blacks, and Jews since the election of Trump, and every one committed in the United States has been a hoax.
But I see huge numbers of entirely real hate crimes committed by non whites and feminists.
The Jewish problem is rather like the Muslim problem.  Not all Muslims are terrorists, but the vast majority of terrorists are Muslims, and similarly not all Jews instigate hate crimes, but if you hear anyone teaching dim witted people to commit hate crimes against whites, he is usually a sharp witted Jew.
Notice that most of the outrage about Trump turning Muslim asylum seekers away comes from people who conspicuously fail to be outraged by Israel turning Muslim asylum seekers away.
Of course they are not all hypocrites:  Soros wants Israel destroyed and Israelis murdered as much as he wants America destroyed and white Americans murdered.  On the whole I prefer the hypocrites.
Trumps ingenious tactic of giving the Jews recognition of Jerusalem but taking away the holocaust tends to split the Jewish hypocrites, so that some of them stop calling for the destruction of America, thus becoming consistent, and some of them start calling for the destruction of Israel, thus becoming consistent.

All of your Black Lives Matter stories involve blacks behaving badly in ways that made it reasonable for cops - or indeed anyone - to shoot them.
Blacks are used to their violence being indulged and overlooked, especially when they engage in violence against whites, and sooner or later they get violent with a man with a gun.  Bad idea.  Every Black lives matter incident is a rerun of George Zimmerman and Trayvon Martin.
Michael Brown is a typical example.  Walking down the middle of the road after robbing a convenience store, confronts a cop for no sane reason, just for the hell of it. Unsurprisingly gets shot while attacking the cop.  And then there was that boy with the highly realistic pellet gun, who is probably whom you are thinking of when you say "shot on camera". Bad idea to shoot cops for the hell of it even with a pellet gun.
I did say in the United States and after the Trump election.  You have to sweep all of history and the entire world to find white hate crimes, whereas black hate crimes against whites happen every day in every black majority neighborhood, and no one pays attention.
Similarly, if you look at cases where a white murders a black (not a white cop, an ordinary white drug dealer or gangster) the black is almost always committing a felony at the time he was shot.  There is about one killing per year of non feloneous blacks by whites, while there are roughly three hundred killings per year of non feloneous whites by blacks.
Black people in the United States are more likely to be victims of violent confrontations with police officers than whites because they commit more violent crimes than whites.  In 2013, black criminals carried out 38% of murders, compared to 31.1% for whites, but despite that more than twice as many white people were killed by police, indicating that a white criminal is at far higher risk of being killed in a confrontation with police than a black criminal - presumably because cops know that any time they defend themselves against vicious subhuman thugs, they will get the Black Lives Matter treatment.

Michael Brown did not shove the cigars back, nor request credit.  He simply took them and roughed up the shopkeeper.  Then he walked down the middle of the street, until he encountered a cop in a cop car.  For no apparent reason, he confronted the cop, and then assaulted the cop, who after a remarkable display of wild and incompetent shooting, finally managed to kill his assailant.
Maybe he thought the cop was going to charge him with stealing the cigars, but in fact the cop was at the time unaware that Michael Brown had just committed a crime.

I remarked earlier that several security proposals would not in practice be useful because Hillary's main security concern was not the Russians stealing her emails, not Wikileaks stealing her emails, not the Chans stealing her emails, but Obama stealing her emails.
Similarly, it is clear that if Trump had a chat with Assad of Syria clearing a bombing run Isis in Syria, his target list would appear in the New York Times, as he bitterly complained in his latest press Indeed this appears to be what has already happened with the Trump's raid on Al Qaeda in Yemen - the information wound up in the hands of Al Qaeda, probably by the State Department electronically intercepting Trump and Pentagon communications and then leaking the information to their pet "Moderate Islamic Opposition" aka Al Qaeda and Islamic State, and as a result several American commandos were killed or wounded.  They got killed as a result of conflict between the red empire of the bases and the blue empire of the consulates.
It very much looks as if Chief Petty Officer William "Ryan" Owens was killed as a result of people in the US government leaking information to the enemies of Americans.  Trump in his recent news conference reports his phone calls are being listened into by his enemies and then made public, so the leak mechanism in the Yemen case was likely similar.
This is far from being the first deadly conflict between the red and blue empires, though the internal conflict within the US government looks to be escalating massively under Trump.
In general, your biggest spying threat is from people mighty close to you.
I am not worried about the CIA spying on me. I am worried about them spying on Trump.
To solve this problem, we need end to end encryption with the keys on your own device.  And we need everyone using by default and standard, so that Hillary's not very bright people and Trumps menials use it when communicating with Hillary and Trump.  Which means all proposals that require managing their own keys are not going to work.
For Hillary's people to use it, it needs to be so standard that even people arranging assignations on Facebook use it without being aware of it.  That is why proprietary usb dongles will not work.
It is unlikely that Trump would manage his own public keys - and he cannot trust the white house staff and government security people to manage them for him.  It is even more unlikely that Podesta would manage his own public keys.  So we need a security mechanism for the masses, a security mechanism that even the Chairman of the Board can use, a security mechanism suitable for everyone in the world, a security mechanism that requires zero clicks.

Ipsec is not very secure.  What I was thinking of is a global database linking phone numbers, email addresses, etc, to public keys with a witness mechanism to ensure that every client gets told the same story as to which public key is associated with which phone number.
So if your client looks up its own public key by phone number, it sees a hash chain connecting that association to the global witness hash, and knows that client it is talking to sees the same public key.  Clients upload and download public keys at infrequent intervals without human This works fine with phones, since people assume one phone number per physical phone.  Phone forwarding systems are assumed to forward from one phone number/physical device to another phone number physical device. Not so fine with email addresses. Just have to give people the 'Your emails are currently encrypted so that they can only be read on the following physical devices ...
"Add current device to list for future emails?"
"Edit list of devices that are empowered to decrypt your email?"
Which interface is likely to confuse and irritate them.
And if you lose or damage the physical device that currently holds all your old emails and you have not backed it up recently, thus losing all your old emails and the secret key that can decrypt them - that could be very handy if an investigation is coming up.

Illegally employing her own email server was an anti Obama security measure, not an anti Wikileaks or anti Chan measure.  She would have been more secure against Wikileaks, the Chans, and the Russians, had she done the legal thing and used the official government (aka Obama) controlled mail server.
Similarly, Google ratting out Petraeus to Obama has caused a sudden and striking disinclination to use Gmail among persons of interest.
Of course Assad would not - but the State Department is supporting Isis, and would.  And someone in the government, probably the CIA or the State Department did leak the equivalent info about the raid in Yemen to Al Qaeda, resulting in many injuries and a death.
I totally support Assad.  He stands between the US State Department, and the genocide of all Alawites, Christians, and all Shiites of Palestinian descent in Syria.  The State Department aims to do to Alawites in Syria what it did to Tutsis in the Congo, and a side effect that they do not much care about or rather like is that Christians in Syria would get genocided also.
Al Qaeda tells us that they knew what was coming.  So chances are that the site *became* well defended shortly after the decision to attack it was made.
There is a tendency to analyze security as if your home computer was secure, which it is not. But the error of analyzing security as if your organization was secure and cohesive is a greater error.  Trump is at far greater risk of being spied on by the CIA and the State Department than the Russians, and the consequences of that spying are more severe. Similarly, Hillary was primarily concerned about Obama spying on her, and was right to be concerned.  Petraeus should have been similarly So security really has to be in the hands of the end user, rather than the organization.  Trump, Hillary, Podesta, Petraeus, and the Chairman of the Board are never going to use PGP, or even correctly use browser Certification Authorities.  Podesta and Hillary's information technology guy did not seem to know what a website certificate is, or how it works.

This may well explain the voting patterns we see, where it is primarily women that vote to import the rapeugees, and well explain the fact that ads and articles seeking popular support for further imports of rapeugees show manly black men rather than cute children.
Revealed preference, female behavior, suggests that female emancipation was a shit test that white Christian males failed, and that conservative Muslim males passed.
I expect that if Islamic State was in the business of kidnapping white Christian women, chaining them up in shipping containers, and shipping them to Islamic state to be sold to the highest bidder, we would see a lot of white single chicks hanging around shipping containers with high

The reason that there "is no evidence of illegals voting" is that we are on the honor system.  No one is allowed to look for evidence of illegals voting.  There is absolutely no check to prevent them from voting, and no way of detecting it if they do.

She spent a short time alone with Till, during which time she now says nothing happened.  After that short time, Till whistled at her, which caused her husband to believe that something had happened.
Till did not deserve to be killed for whistling at her, but today it often enough happens that people are killed for similar acts.
I was in an elevator with a young lady.  A man said "Hello" to that lady and smiled at her.  I placed my hand on her shoulder and stared at him expressionlessly and silently.  From his reaction I am pretty sure he feared I was going to kill him, even though my expression was totally neutral, blank, and stone faced.
Because people do get killed for that sort of thing today.  Race has nothing to do with it.  That was a murder, not a lynching, and similar murders happen today all the time.
The Tulsa massacre was the murder of ten white men by racist blacks, followed by whites ethnically cleansing the infestation of dangerous blacks from their town.
A black man assaulted a white woman.  He was arrested.
Believing he was likely to be lynched a group of 75 armed blacks went to the courthouse and politely asked that he be secured to receive a fair trial - the white sheriff told them he would receive a fair trial and politely asked them to go home.
These seventy five armed black men confronted a large group of white men in a predominantly white area, some of them armed, who they suspected intended to lynch the black youth who had assaulted a white woman.  The blacks opened fire, killing ten of the white men.
In short, blacks started it, and whites finished it.
If the whites had actually grabbed the youth from the courthouse you would have a point.  But the blacks opened fire on suspicion that the whites might grab the youth from the courthouse, which is much the same thing as blacks lynching whites on vague suspicion, and very different from whites lynching blacks on vague suspicion.
So produce your example of someone wrongfully lynched.

Science largely stopped progressing shortly after World War II.  It has become a priesthood in lab coats.  Peer Review is the priesthood at synod, conspiring behind closed doors to develop a uniform party line. Instead of experimentalists telling us what they see, they are told what they will see.
Technology in West largely stopped progressing after 1972.
Compare, for example "Freedom Tower" with the Two Towers.  Its highest inhabitable floor is substantially smaller and lower than the highest inhabited floor of the two towers, and it just looks ugly, unimpressive, and sadly early twentieth century, a little bit old fashioned.  Our fastest fighter planes have smarter electronics, but they fly slower, do not fly so high, and are less maneuverable.
Technology continues to progress in East Asia, though slowly, for example ever better phone screens, LED lighting, higher energy density batteries, and so on and so forth.

Because WTC 7 was falling sideways before it fell downwards, it did not fall on its own footprint.
The building was falling apart, piece by piece, in an irregular and uneven fashion, until it finally collapsed downwards all at once
First the fuel tank fell down demolishing much of the building's interior.
Then a while after that, quite a while after that, the roof buckles. With the roof losing rigidity, there is nothing to stop the building from leaning to one side.  It proceeds to lean to one side, very slowly at first, then faster and faster, like a tree falling over, then collapses downwards all at once, no longer like a tree but like a building.
Yes, the final fall, collapsing downwards all at once is just like a controlled demolition - but the half hour leading up to that was things falling apart in a way totally unlike controlled demolition, and the few seconds leading up to collapsing downwards all at once was the building falling to one side, the complete opposite of a symmetric collapse.

There is a video of the last couple of guys inside the WTC 7, a newsman and a secret service guy.  They are searching for wounded who might need evacuation - because large parts of the building have already fallen down, and they expect the rest to come down shortly.
There is rubble everywhere, because the building is disintegrating slowly around them, and after a bit they realize it is not so slow any more and they decide it is past time to get the hell out.
They clearly expect the building to fall soon. Do you suppose that they were in on the conspiracy and were planting demolition charges?

In America, Americans are not free - as the fate of Brendan Eich To attain a similar level of freedom in the US, we will need to end elections, for everyone who goes to Harvard is taught, and required to believe, that whites are a cancer upon the earth and white civilization needs to be eradicated.
This teaching is, like "liquidation of the kulaks as a class", deliberately ambiguous as to whether whites need to be erased physically or merely culturally, but by the time the teaching filters out of Havard down to their voter banks, it necessarily simplifies to the doctrine that whites need to be erased physically, "cultural erasure" being a little bit too complicated for the more typical Democrat voter, a little bit too complicated for the low part of the high low alliance.

Some of us closer than others.
That all humans are one species is not a fact about biology, but a fact about terminology. Darwin observed that differences between races were easily large enough to categorize them as species differences, rather than race differences, but did not want to wind up drawing an arbitrary line through the Sahara.
The difference between spotted owls and barred owls is less than the difference between whites and east asians, but they get a species designation, in part because bird watchers are splitters.
I, and Darwin, have studied human evolution extensively and deeply.
Charles Darwin optimistically predicted:
civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace throughout the world the savage races. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes, as Professor Schaaffhausen has remarked, will no doubt be exterminated. The break will then be rendered wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilised state as we may hope, than the Caucasian and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as at present between the negro or Australian and the gorilla.”
Thomas Dixon correctly pointed out.
- rich beyond the dream of poet’s fancy, crunching acres of diamonds beneath his bare black feet. Yet he never picked one up from the dust until a white man showed to him its glittering light. His land swarmed with powerful and docile animals, yet he never dreamed a harness, cart, or sled. A hunter by necessity, he never made an axe, spear, or arrowhead worth preserving beyond the moment of its use. He lived as an ox, content to graze for an hour. In a land of stone and timber he never sawed a foot of lumber, carved a block, or built a house save of broken sticks and mud. With league on league of ocean strand and miles of inland seas, for four thousand years he watched their surface ripple under the wind, heard the thunder of the surf on his beach, the howl of the storm over his head, gazed on the dim blue horizon calling him to worlds that lie beyond, and yet he never dreamed a sail.”
People point out the great Zimbabwe as a supposed counter example to Thomas Dixon, but gene testing shows that local legends that the place was built by Hebrew gold miners are true.  Similarly the ancient cities of Ethiopia - built by Kings of the line of King Solomon, with the assistance of regular imports of fresh Jewish architects.
There are some hot Tutsis.   Mrs Helsinki, however, is not one of them.
If you look at Mrs Helsinki, and look at a hot Tutsi, it is obvious which one is further from the ape, and closer to modern type human. Which is why our government has been sponsoring the genocide of Tutsis in the Congo.  Like owls intermediate between the spotted and barred, Tutsis are an embarrassment, and progs need to exterminate embarrassments.

Darwin discussing whether to classify humans as one species or several:
     We will first consider the arguments which may be advanced in favour of classing the races of man as distinct species, and then and then the arguments on the other side.
     …
     The inferior vitality of mulattoes is spoken of in a trustworthy work as a well-known phenomenon; and this, although a different consideration from their lessened fertility, may perhaps be advanced as a proof of the specific distinctness of the parent races.
     …
     Now if we reflect on the weighty arguments above given, for raising the races of man to the dignity of species, and the insuperable difficulties on the other side in defining them, it seems that the term “sub-species”might here be used with propriety. But from long habit the term “race” will perhaps always be employed.
     …
     Through the means just specified, aided perhaps by others as yet undiscovered, man has been raised to his present state. Butsince he attained to the rank of manhood, he has diverged into distinct races, or as they may be more fitly called, sub-species. Some of these, such as the Negro and European, are so distinct that, if specimens had been brought to a naturalist without any further information, they would undoubtedly have been considered by him as good and true species
     Our naturalist would then perhaps turn to geographical distribution, and he would probably declare that those forms must be distinct species, which differ not only in appearance, but are fitted for hot, as well as damp or dry countries, and for the Arctic regions. He might appeal to the fact that no species in the group next to man–namely, the Quadrumana, can resist low temperature, or any considerable change of climate; and that the species which come nearest to man have never been reared to maturity, even under the temperate climate of Europe. He would be deeply impressed with the fact, first noticed by Agassiz (7. ‘Diversity of Origin of the Human Races,’ in the ‘Christian Examiner,’ July 1850.), that the different races of man are distributed over the world in the same zoological provinces, as those inhabited by undoubtedly distinct species and genera of mammals. This is manifestly the case with the Australian, Mongolian, and Negro races of man; in a less well-marked manner with the Hottentots; but plainly with the Papuans and Malays, who are separated, as Mr. Wallace has shewn, by nearly the same line which divides the great Malayan and Australian zoological provinces. The Aborigines of America range throughout the Continent; and this at first appears opposed to the above rule, for most ofthe productions of the Southern and Northern halves differ widely: yet some few living forms,as the opossum, range from the one into the other, as did formerly some of the gigantic Edentata. The Esquimaux, like other Arctic animals, extend round the whole polar regions. It should be observed that the amount of difference between the mammals of the several zoological provinces does not correspond with the degree of separation between the latter; so that it can hardly be considered as an anomaly that the Negro differs more, and the American much less from the other races of man, than do the mammals of the African and American continents from the mammals of the other provinces. Man, it may be added, does not appear to have aboriginally inhabited any oceanic island; and in this respect, he resembles the other members of his class.
     In determining whether the supposed varieties of the same kind of domestic animal should be ranked as such, or as specifically distinct, that is,whether any of them are descended from distinct wild species, every naturalist would lay much stress on the fact of their external parasites being specifically distinct. All the more stress would be laid on this fact, as it would be an exceptional one; for I am informed by Mr. Denny that the most different kinds of dogs, fowls, and pigeons, in England, are infested by the same species of Pediculi or lice. Now Mr. A. Murray has carefully examined the Pediculi collected indifferent countries from the different races of man (8. ‘Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,’ vol. xxii, 1861, p. 567.); and he finds that they differ, not only in colour, but in the structure of their claws and limbs. In every case in which many specimens were obtained the differences were constant. The surgeon of a whaling ship in the Pacific assured me that when the Pediculi, with which some Sandwich Islanders on board swarmed, strayed on to the bodies of the English sailors, they died in the course of three or four days. These Pediculi were darker coloured, and appeared different from those proper to the natives of Chiloe in South America,of which he gave me specimens. These, again, appeared larger and much softer than European lice. Mr. Murray procured four kinds from Africa, namely, from the Negroes of the Eastern and Western coasts, from the Hottentots and Kaffirs; two kinds from the natives of Australia; two from North and two from South America. In these latter cases it may be presumed that the Pediculi came from natives inhabiting different districts. With insects slight structural differences, if constant, are generally esteemed of specific value: and the fact of the races of man being infested by parasites, which appear to be specifically distinct, might fairly be urged as an argument that the races themselves ought to be classed as distinct species.

If you are white, you are racist.  If you are racist, which is to say white, a large proportion of the voters, soon to be a majority, believe you should be physically attacked.
Recall the debate on Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman:
If Martin attacked Zimmerman, Zimmerman was innocent.  If Zimmerman attacked Martin, Zimmerman guilty of murder.
Everyone who claimed Zimmerman was guilty claimed to believe that Zimmerman attacked Martin - but, as evidence for their position, presented not evidence that Zimmerman attacked Martin, but evidence that Zimmerman behaved provocatively by profiling Martin, thus justifying Martin chimping out on Zimmerman.
They claimed to believe that Zimmerman attacked Martin, but as evidence for this supposed belief presented grounds for Martin to attack Zimmerman.
They claimed to believe that Zimmerman attacked Martin, but their words betrayed the belief that blacks are entitled to physically attack whites and whites are not entitled to defend themselves.

Pretty much everyone who thought Zimmerman guilty, and pretty much everyone who prematurely condemned the Duke Lacrosse team on the testimony of a lying drunken thieving violent black whore who was trying to talk her way out of a yet another charge of violent drunken assault in a long history of violent drunken assaults and stupid violent thefts, believes that blacks have right to chimp out on whites because all whites are guilty of racism, believe that whites make Africa and Detroit poor, and that if only whites were eliminated other races would have all the stuff that whites have.
That was implicit in the arguments we heard for the guilt of Zimmerman, and implicit in the arguments we heard for the premature conviction of the Duke Lacrosse team.
Pretty much everyone who has been educated in Harvard believes that if only whites were eliminated other races would have all the stuff that whites have.
When Obama says "You did not build that", what near fifty percent of the voters hear is that wealth just springs forth from the magic dirt, and due to racism, white people get it all.
When the BLM burns down a supermarket that whites built and beats up the whites that built it, and that supermarket is not promptly replaced by a supermarket run by black women that gives out stuff for free, they think that the reason they were not given a supermarket the way white males supposedly were given ("You did not build that") is racism.
They are outraged and indignant that they do not get a new supermarket the way that Obama told them whites got a new supermarket.
That is the worldview taught in Harvard, and its logical implication is that all whites should be murdered.
Harvard, and Obama, preach slogans that like "liquidation of the kulaks as a class" preserve a careful ambiguity between erasing white culture and civilization, and erasing whites physically. Harvard engages in symbolic acts erasing white civilization, but when these symbolic acts get down to their vote bank, the mass of the voters hear Harvard instigating the physical erasure of whites, that the physical erasure of whites is desirable and morally right.

By your deeds, you admit the reality that the differences between races on many important matters are greater than the usual differences between one member of that race and another member of that race - that in many important matters the differences in behavior between one race and another are greater than a standard deviation.
I bet you, or more likely your parents, spend a great deal of money to live in a place where there are no blacks.
In America, nearly every white who can afford to, lives in a place where you cannot go anywhere without a car, because fewer blacks go to places where you need cars to go to, and where all the public spaces are in fact private, like shopping malls, so that private security can deal with blacks who act up.
In America, there are some hip white people who live in vibrant zones, but they are mostly young and male, thus better able to defend themselves, and mostly single, and thus disproportionately gay, because they would not like to expose wives and children to such danger.
Under Obama, gentrification has been reversed by ethnic cleansing.
Recall that YouTube video about a woman walking around in New York city and being harassed by males - "10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman"
It would have been more accurately captioned "10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a White"  There were a bunch of reply videos that showed that a woman could walk for ten hours in white areas and have no problems.
In areas where there are vibrants, no white person uses the buses, because a white taking a bus will be beaten up.
Remember all that stuff about sending black people to the back of the bus.  You wanted integrated buses, but instead got buses with no whites.
If you look at black countries where blacks are doing OK, they have simple laws harshly enforced, for example Botswana.  For blacks to thrive, they need to live under laws substantially different from those that enable whites to thrive.
This is pretty obvious in schools, where a disciplinary process that is fine for whites results in total chaos and major brutal violence in black schools.  For blacks to get an education, they need to be whipped from time to time.  Any black parent with an intact well functioning family will tell you that.  And that is pretty much what the Botswanan police will tell you.

I earlier pointed out how having blacks under the same laws and legal system as whites has been a disaster for blacks and a disaster for whites, resulting in a situation where for a white person to form a family, he has to spend a fortune on staying away from blacks.  Blacks cannot thrive under a legal system designed for whites. They need harsher and simpler laws like those of Burundi, and blacks cannot learn much in school without being whipped, as the chaos of black schools demonstrates.  To thrive, blacks need simpler and harsher laws, more brutally enforced, that whites.
But there is a another big difference between blacks and whites: Family Just about every white man, as near all of them as makes no difference, makes a huge effort to be a father to his children, in the face of a legal system that attempts to impose black style families on whites.
Almost no black men, as near none of them as makes no difference, make much effort to be a father to their children.
It was wrong of us to attempt to impose white style families on black people back in the 1950s, and it is wrong of us to impose black style families on white people today.
We should have one set of laws, African style marriage, for blacks reproducing, and a different set of laws, traditional European style marriage, for whites reproducing.

In practice, the consequences of applying the same laws in the same way to people of different races are so disastrous that even progs have one hundred and one hypocritical and ingenious ways of ensuring that different races are subject to different laws, de facto and de jure.
For example, obviously alcohol should be legal for whites, and illegal for feather Indians (native north Americans) and progs have one hundred and one legal rationales for making this happen, for example alcohol is commonly illegal in and near Indian reservations.
Drug laws are enforced very differently for blacks and whites, because drugs have disastrous effects on black communities, but not white communities.  Whites on marijuana do not cause problems for other people, as near to none of them as make no difference.  All blacks on marijuana cause big problems for other people, as near to all of them as makes no difference.
The closer someone's race is to apes, the worse the effect of alcohol and drugs.  This difference between races is much larger than the difference between individuals of the same race.
The difference is quite evident even with the highly evolved East Asians.  Venture capitalists usually suspect that engineers are trying to scam them (and usually engineers are trying to scam them) so they like to get drunk with the people they are considering funding, for in wine their is truth.  But even a small amount of alcohol is apt to make an East Asian badly behaved and physically ill.  So the highly evolved East Asians are reluctant to drink enough that you can rely on them to speak truth, so business deals involving East Asians tend to rely more on shared blackmail material, and less on getting drunk together.
A white engineer will cheerfully drink a lot more than an East Asian engineer, but unlike the East Asian engineer, will remain well behaved and fit as a fiddle, even though his ability and inclination to lie It is hard to get East Asian engineers drunk enough to get the truth out of them, and if you do get them drunk enough to get the truth out of them, they are likely to chuck up.
With less evolved races however, the worse alcohol affects them, the more they are inclined to drink it, lacking the self control of East Asians.
Thus in practice, even in very prog San Francisco, drug laws are enforced one way on whites, and in a very different, much harsher, way on blacks, and that is the way the black community likes it.

Even less can progs endure the disastrous consequences of applying the same laws to men and women, and they have one hundred and one hypocritical and ingenious ways of ensuring that different sexes are subject to different laws de jure, for example VAWA and Title IX, and treated very differently de facto under what is nominally the same law.
Not only is the marital contract enforced, de jure, on men but not on women, but ordinary contracts are enforced de facto on men but not on women.
Women are allowed to make their own decisions, but when those decisions go bad, as they frequently do because women are childish, illogical, irrational and emotional, white men wind up paying for the costs of decisions made by women of all races.
Libertarians and Men's Rights Activists argue that we should deal with this by demanding that women bear the costs of their own decisions, but when women were emancipated in the Victorian era, we tried that, and the result was far too many women giving birth in dark alleys in the rain, so we wound up with the disastrous system we have now, where women of all races get to make their own decisions, and white men get to pay for those decisions.
In truth, demanding that women be free to make contracts and also be held to contracts is as harsh, ridiculous, and unreasonable as demanding that children be free to make contracts and also be held to contracts, and everyone intuitively realizes this when it comes to actual practical cases, even though they claim to disagree with it in theory and in the Fertile age women therefore should always be under the tutelage of fathers or husbands.  Fertile age women who find themselves without a father or a husband should be detained in government homes for wayward girls under government supervision until they can find a husband willing to take care of them, similar to the Female Factory in late eighteenth century Australia and early nineteenth century Australia. Women in public should be under the supervision of husband or male kin, in the sense that if they behave badly it should be easy to find the responsible male and ask him to take care of the problem, just as we deal with children that misbehave in public places.

Not in half a sentence:
VAWA:  Violence Against Women Act.
effect is that in any dispute, police are required to assume the man is in the wrong and the woman in the right.
Title IX:  is a portion of the United States Education Amendments of 1972, prohibiting discrimination against women.   The major absurd effect is that women are supposed to be just as athletic as men, and if they are not, male physical activity must be punished and discouraged. Also effectively discourages teaching geometry or any area of academics were women perform egregiously worse than men, but by far the biggest and most absurd effect is on sports, because that is the area where female underperformance is most egregious.
But academic areas where women perform better than men, or it can be pretended that they do, are just fine.  Title IX prohibits discrimination against women, but not against men.  Any unequal outcomes to women's disfavor must be the result of evil hateful misogyny, but any unequal outcomes to women's favor must be the result of the fact that women are wonderful.
The practical consequence of Title IX is that despite the fact that women perform lower than men on IQ tests, and have considerably less motive than men to get an education, women are massively over represented in education.  (Which under Title IX does not count as discrimination, though any under representation of women in in any specific area, such as sports, does count as discrimination.)

Financial incentive to have a family rather than be a single parent has been tried.  Turns out that childbearing is profoundly unresponsive to merely financial incentives.
The early Victorians proceeded to emancipate women, figuring that since women were naturally virtuous and responsible, no disaster would ensue. The result, of course, was far too many women giving birth in dark alleys in the rain, eventually leading to our marginally less disastrous welfare state.   I don't have any statistics as to how many, but it was unacceptably many.
(And no, it is not the pill that made the difference.  We have had the condom since the late bronze age, and the sponge since the time of Caesar. In practice, the supposed beneficial effects of new and improved contraception, or campaigns to spread knowledge and use of contraception, only appear at the same time as the actual beneficial effects of welfare for single mothers.  The pill was effectively illegal in Japan until quite recently.  It made only a marginal difference.)
Regency period Australia had another solution to single women who were not being supervised by fathers or husbands, which solution horrifies moderns, and indeed horrified Victorians, but it undeniably worked. That solution being that you just do not allow fertile age women to follow their pussies wherever their pussies might lead. You don't allow women to sleep with men who cannot or will not marry them if pregnant, you don't allow a married woman to sleep with any man other than her husband, and you don't allow women to be disrespectful to their husbands.  You keep women under as much control as necessary to prevent sexual misbehavior.  Which turns out to be quite a lot of control.

At present three hundred million people communicate by Viber.
When you install Viber, it generates a secret key and a public key and sends the public key to Viber headquarters.
When Ann wants to message Bob, Viber headquarters sends Ann's client Bob's public key, and Bob's client Ann's public key.
And then they can message each other, no one on the network, not even Viber headquarters, can know what they are saying to each other.
Unfortunately Viber could send Ann a public key belonging to the CIA as Bob's key and Bob another key belonging to the CIA as Ann's key, and then the CIA can be in the middle as Ann and Bob send messages to each other.  Ann thinks she is sending a message to Bob, but actually she is sending it to the CIA, which then resends it to Bob.
To prevent this, to deny itself this capability, Viber could maintain a rolling global hash representing the current mapping between ids and public keys, and all past mappings between ids and public keys, and when it sends Ann the key for Bob, sends Ann the hash path connecting Bob's mapping to the current rolling hash for the entire world and all of history.
We have several mutually hostile people and organizations monitoring this rolling hash, for example the KGB, the CIA, Wikileaks, and Trump's security guy (who I think is one of his sons or grandsons). Your software picks an organization at random.  The user could intervene and pick one, or pick several, but ordinarily will not.
Suppose Viber headquarters arranges for the CIA to spy on Ann and Bob. If Ann and Bob's Viber clients have both picked the CIA for their source for the rolling hash, then they are out of luck, but if one of them has picked the KGB and the other has picked the CIA, then the one that picks the KGB will get the correct version of the rolling hash, in which case the attempted man in the middle attack will fail, and that Viber headquarters is collaborating with the CIA will be exposed to the KGB, to Ann, and to Bob.
Thus Viber could prove it is not spying on its users.

It is a lot easier, and a lot more reliable, to determine someone's race, than to determine their character.  And their race often gives a good enough prediction of certain important aspects of their character.
In particular, in the events leading to the mortgage meltdown, race was a better predictor of propensity to default on one's mortgage than any of the permissible credit characteristics.
You are walking down a dark street.  Two other people are also walking down that street.  One is a black male, one is a white male.  The black male is quite unlikely to murder you.  But if you are worried about being murdered, and you probably should be, he is one hell of a lot more likely to murder you than the white male.  About thirteen times more likely in fact.
Similarly, if you are a banker who is worried that someone is going to blow off his mortgage ... well doubtless there are a lot of blacks, probably most of those blacks with good credit ratings, who will not blow off their mortgage.  But if someone is black with a good credit rating, he is one hell of a lot more likely to blow off his mortgage than someone who is white with a good credit rating.
The more you know about a debtor, the less is race adds to accuracy of predicting the likelihood of default.  But even if you have complete credit data, race is still substantially predictive.  The chance of a white man and a black man with equal credit ratings defaulting on a mortgage is far from equal.
Similarly, if a white man and a black man both have long and horrible criminal records, they are about equally likely to murder you.  But if a white man and a black man both have minor criminal records, the chance that the black man will go on to commit murder is far from equal.

Because fertility between kinds gradually diminishes as they become more and more different, and even radically different kinds often have some limited interfertility, there is no sharp line between a species difference and a race difference.
But if interfertility is definitely zero (which is less common than you would think - you can get some mighty surprising hybrids) then it is definitely a species difference.
As Darwin explained, the origin of species is that different races are exposed to different selective pressures, and over time tend to become more different, resulting in gradual diminution of interbreeding and Darwin's account of speciation - that speciation is usually and primarily sympatric - has been confirmed by studies of speciation in fish, in particular sticklebacks, and studies of speciation in The counter theory is Gould's punctuated equilibrium, which is the scientific justification for your pseudo scientific babble.
Gould invented punctuated equilibrium in order to have a pseudo scientific theory proving that all men are created equal, since Darwin's account of speciation implies that the processes that create races create inequality.
So people looked into Gould's theory, and it was disconfirmed, and Darwin's horribly racist account of speciation (that sympatric speciation is normal, gradual, common, and happening everywhere all the time) confirmed - at least for numerous non mammalian kinds.

After the horrifying bloodbaths of the twentieth century, the doctrines of equality and demotism should be thoroughly and utterly discredited, should be seen as outrageous, shocking, and evil.
Yet strangely, they are not.
I notice that the Democrats are working their way towards rationalizing nuclear war with Russia, since a hundred million human sacrifices to equality and social justice during the twentieth century were not enough.  They have a lot of overly clever and excessively complicated rationales, but the real reason is this:
Razer sells out to the left because the arc of history supposedly is But Russia, instead of turning prog after communism, shows strong signs of turning to the faith that used to be known as Christianity before progs reinvented Christianity as yet another form of proggism.   Maybe the arc of history is not ever leftwards.  Maybe left wing movements go ever leftwards till they end catastrophically.  Maybe the arc of history peaked at Pol Pot.
Razer hears a voice in his head telling him he has sold his soul and has been speaking power to truth.
Razer wants Russia nuked to make the arc of history go the way it is supposed to so that terrible voice in his head will stop saying terrible things about him.  Nuking Russia is motivated by the same motives as "Never Trump" - that if leftist victory is not inevitable, then it is all a lie, and leftists lose status.
The US sponsored coup to seize the Ukraine is a symptom, not a cause. The actual cause is that Russians treat Pussy Riot as beggars, gypsies, whores, tramps, and thieves, as low status.
The US believes that when Pussy Riot barges into a Cathedral and vandalizes it, the Christians should stop being offensive to Pussy Riot, rather than that Pussy Riot should stop being offensive to Christians, because Pussy Riot is high status and Christians are low status - and if Pussy Riot is low status, then people who post equalist piety to this list are low status, and therefore razer is low status, therefore, they think, Russia needs to be nuked, in order that razer and other people who post off topic equalist crap to this list can be high status.

Here is a collection of the latest on the incident.
tl;dr  Leftists beat up a shitload of people.  Guy who got shot had brass knuckles and a big knife.  Employed the brass knuckles to beat up lots of people.  Got shot as a result.
Look at the video:
A short middle aged Asian man in a yellow hat is minding his own business when an a big antifa races out of the crowd, attacks him and beats him up, one of the many, many, many attacks on real, suspected, alleged, or imaginary rightists that have been happening since Trump was elected.  He chases the short guy in the yellow hat all over the place, a bunch of other antifa joined in or are about to join in, then the short Asian guy in the yellow hat shoots the antifa, or possibly a trump supporter in a red hat shoots the antifa to protect the short Asian guy in the yellow hat.
The guy who got shot is not a union organizer, but a union enforcer.  He is an antifa, one of the people in the left who maintain the ideological uniformity of the left by beating up and frequently murdering fellow leftists who deviate from the latest line.
It is not yet clear who did the shooting, and whose side the Asian guy was on, but it is clear who was shot, and whose side he was on. Regardless of who did the shooting, the shooting was defense against a left wing ideological enforcer who was doing a bit of enforcement.
The second amendment is the ultimate defense of the first.
There have been thousands of vicious attacks on real and suspected Trump supporters, and very little of it is getting coverage.

We saw on video, several videos, this union organizer pursue and attack a man much smaller than himself, and with the aid of his brass knuckles and several of his friends beat the crap out of that man.
He was in possession of brass knuckles and large knife, and since the brass knuckles saw plenty of use on the video, I suppose the knife was also used on less public occasions, that being the usual way the left does political organization and maintains ideological uniformity.
The reason people are all quiet about this incident, while they made a big deal about George Zimmerman shooting a small time mugger and burglar, is that it was all recorded on video from multiple angles. There is absolutely no doubt whatever that whoever the man being attacked was, and whoever fired the gun, the man who got shot was committing a felony, was shot to prevent him from continuing to commit that felony, and is a leftist political enforcer whose job it is to enforce leftism the way it is always enforced: by violence.

Tulsi Gabbard was always a thorn in the side of the Blue Empire, but she started speaking truth to power when Trump was elected.
Tulsi Gabbard is described as a Combat Veteran.  Normally, of course, women in combat are whores, cowards, and traitors, but Tulsi Gabbard, though forced to dress in men's clothes, did not pretend to shoot at the enemy, did not pretend to be a warrior, but instead bravely and patriotically took care of warriors injured on the battlefield, a proper role for a brave and patriotic woman, which role exposed her to real danger, though of course less danger than an actual warrior, as is only proper, for women are the precious sex, while men are the expendable sex.
However in our degenerate era, women who perform their proper roles in war and battle are forced to dress as men, and get men's job descriptions, when they should be classed as camp followers, and given more flattering costumes.
Eighty percent of our army, including all the women and nearly all the nonwhites, should be reclassified as camp followers, rather than soldiers.
Which does not make anything Tulsi Gabbard did any the less honorable, brave, and patriotic, despite being forced to dress as a trannie pervert.

In general, what do libertarians do when the other guys organize collective violence on the basis of race, religion, or ideology?
It is not just actual states, like Islamic state.  Any cohesive religion or ethnicity can and frequently does do stuff that is somewhat like what a state can do.  As for example recent drastic reversals of gentrification by black people collectively engaged in activities that are rather close to ethnic cleansing of whites.
Conversely, any functional state is held together by a ruling tribe, ethnicity, religion, or ideology, and if the ruling tribe loses cohesion, or people lose faith in the ruling ideology or religion, the state is apt to fall apart.
Orthodox Jews have enclaves in places where most nonblacks would find it difficult because they can engage in collective defense against blacks without being deemed nazis and fascists.
Cohesive groups can predate on incohesive categories and frequently do. If you find a cohesive group is predating on you, what are you going to do?

Usually through tribalism, ethnic identity, ideology, or shared

And what happens if men do not come to be a nation, or just cease to
be nation, perhaps because of loss of tribal or religious identity?

cohesion that you do, more asabiyyah than you do  Enemies take your
women, your land, and your stuff.  Whites got ethnically cleansed out
of Detroit and the inner city.  White Swedish chicks get pregnant by
brown or black Muslims and white male taxpayers who cannot get laid
pay for other men's children.
A people with high asabiyyah, like the pagan Icelanders, can get by
without a central government, provided that they are proud, brave, and
valiant warriors, but when Christianity arrived, things fell apart.
Something like anarcho capitalism worked for the pagan Icelanders,
because they had a state religion without a state, because their

That is just the first video I clicked on.  I recall several other videos in which the uneven, disorderly, irregular and asymmetric nature of the collapse was even more obvious.

Because WTC 7 was falling sideways before it fell downwards, it did not fall on its own footprint.
The building was falling apart, piece by piece, in an irregular and uneven fashion, until it finally collapsed downwards all at once
First the fuel tank fell down demolishing much of the building's interior.
Then a while after that, quite a while after that, the roof buckles. With the roof losing rigidity, there is nothing to stop the building from leaning to one side.  It proceeds to lean to one side, very slowly at first, then faster and faster, like a tree falling over, then collapses downwards all at once, no longer like a tree but like a building.
Yes, the final fall, collapsing downwards all at once is just like a controlled demolition - but the half hour leading up to that was things falling apart in a way totally unlike controlled demolition, and the few seconds leading up to collapsing downwards all at once was the building falling to one side, the complete opposite of a symmetric collapse.

There is rubble everywhere, because the building is disintegrating slowly around them, and after a bit they realize it is not so slow any more and they decide it is past time to get the hell out.
They clearly expect the building to fall soon. Do you suppose that they were in on the conspiracy and were planting demolition charges?

Darwin observed that differences between races were easily large enough to categorize them as species differences, rather than race differences, but did not want to wind up drawing an arbitrary line through the Sahara.
The difference between spotted owls and barred owls is less than the difference between whites and east asians, but they get a species designation, in part because bird watchers are splitters.
I, and Darwin, have studied human evolution extensively and deeply.
Charles Darwin optimistically predicted:
civilised races of man will almost certainly exterminate and replace throughout the world the savage races. At the same time the anthropomorphous apes, as Professor Schaaffhausen has remarked, will no doubt be exterminated. The break will then be rendered wider, for it will intervene between man in a more civilised state as we may hope, than the Caucasian and some ape as low as a baboon, instead of as at present between the negro or Australian and the gorilla.”
Thomas Dixon correctly pointed out.
- rich beyond the dream of poet’s fancy, crunching acres of diamonds beneath his bare black feet. Yet he never picked one up from the dust until a white man showed to him its glittering light. His land swarmed with powerful and docile animals, yet he never dreamed a harness, cart, or sled. A hunter by necessity, he never made an axe, spear, or arrowhead worth preserving beyond the moment of its use. He lived as an ox, content to graze for an hour. In a land of stone and timber he never sawed a foot of lumber, carved a block, or built a house save of broken sticks and mud. With league on league of ocean strand and miles of inland seas, for four thousand years he watched their surface ripple under the wind, heard the thunder of the surf on his beach, the howl of the storm over his head, gazed on the dim blue horizon calling him to worlds that lie beyond, and yet he never dreamed a sail.”
People point out the great Zimbabwe as a supposed counter example to Thomas Dixon, but gene testing shows that local legends that the place was built by Hebrew gold miners are true.  Similarly the ancient cities of Ethiopia - built by Kings of the line of King Solomon, with the assistance of regular imports of fresh Jewish architects.
There are some hot Tutsis.   Mrs Helsinki, however, is not one of them.
If you look at Mrs Helsinki, and look at a hot Tutsi, it is obvious which one is further from the ape, and closer to modern type human. Which is why our government has been sponsoring the genocide of Tutsis in the Congo.  Like owls intermediate between the spotted and barred, Tutsis are an embarrassment, and progs need to exterminate embarrassments.

Darwin discussing whether to classify humans as one species or several:
     We will first consider the arguments which may be advanced in favour of classing the races of man as distinct species, and then and then the arguments on the other side.
     …
     The inferior vitality of mulattoes is spoken of in a trustworthy work as a well-known phenomenon; and this, although a different consideration from their lessened fertility, may perhaps be advanced as a proof of the specific distinctness of the parent races.
     …
     Now if we reflect on the weighty arguments above given, for raising the races of man to the dignity of species, and the insuperable difficulties on the other side in defining them, it seems that the term “sub-species”might here be used with propriety. But from long habit the term “race” will perhaps always be employed.
     …
     Through the means just specified, aided perhaps by others as yet undiscovered, man has been raised to his present state. Butsince he attained to the rank of manhood, he has diverged into distinct races, or as they may be more fitly called, sub-species. Some of these, such as the Negro and European, are so distinct that, if specimens had been brought to a naturalist without any further information, they would undoubtedly have been considered by him as good and true species
     Our naturalist would then perhaps turn to geographical distribution, and he would probably declare that those forms must be distinct species, which differ not only in appearance, but are fitted for hot, as well as damp or dry countries, and for the Arctic regions. He might appeal to the fact that no species in the group next to man–namely, the Quadrumana, can resist low temperature, or any considerable change of climate; and that the species which come nearest to man have never been reared to maturity, even under the temperate climate of Europe. He would be deeply impressed with the fact, first noticed by Agassiz (7. ‘Diversity of Origin of the Human Races,’ in the ‘Christian Examiner,’ July 1850.), that the different races of man are distributed over the world in the same zoological provinces, as those inhabited by undoubtedly distinct species and genera of mammals. This is manifestly the case with the Australian, Mongolian, and Negro races of man; in a less well-marked manner with the Hottentots; but plainly with the Papuans and Malays, who are separated, as Mr. Wallace has shewn, by nearly the same line which divides the great Malayan and Australian zoological provinces. The Aborigines of America range throughout the Continent; and this at first appears opposed to the above rule, for most ofthe productions of the Southern and Northern halves differ widely: yet some few living forms,as the opossum, range from the one into the other, as did formerly some of the gigantic Edentata. The Esquimaux, like other Arctic animals, extend round the whole polar regions. It should be observed that the amount of difference between the mammals of the several zoological provinces does not correspond with the degree of separation between the latter; so that it can hardly be considered as an anomaly that the Negro differs more, and the American much less from the other races of man, than do the mammals of the African and American continents from the mammals of the other provinces. Man, it may be added, does not appear to have aboriginally inhabited any oceanic island; and in this respect, he resembles the other members of his class.
     In determining whether the supposed varieties of the same kind of domestic animal should be ranked as such, or as specifically distinct, that is,whether any of them are descended from distinct wild species, every naturalist would lay much stress on the fact of their external parasites being specifically distinct. All the more stress would be laid on this fact, as it would be an exceptional one; for I am informed by Mr. Denny that the most different kinds of dogs, fowls, and pigeons, in England, are infested by the same species of Pediculi or lice. Now Mr. A. Murray has carefully examined the Pediculi collected indifferent countries from the different races of man (8. ‘Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,’ vol. xxii, 1861, p. 567.); and he finds that they differ, not only in colour, but in the structure of their claws and limbs. In every case in which many specimens were obtained the differences were constant. The surgeon of a whaling ship in the Pacific assured me that when the Pediculi, with which some Sandwich Islanders on board swarmed, strayed on to the bodies of the English sailors, they died in the course of three or four days. These Pediculi were darker coloured, and appeared different from those proper to the natives of Chiloe in South America,of which he gave me specimens. These, again, appeared larger and much softer than European lice. Mr. Murray procured four kinds from Africa, namely, from the Negroes of the Eastern and Western coasts, from the Hottentots and Kaffirs; two kinds from the natives of Australia; two from North and two from South America. In these latter cases it may be presumed that the Pediculi came from natives inhabiting different districts. With insects slight structural differences, if constant, are generally esteemed of specific value: and the fact of the races of man being infested by parasites, which appear to be specifically distinct, might fairly be urged as an argument that the races themselves ought to be classed as distinct species.

If Martin attacked Zimmerman, Zimmerman was innocent.  If Zimmerman attacked Martin, Zimmerman guilty of murder.
Everyone who claimed Zimmerman was guilty claimed to believe that Zimmerman attacked Martin - but, as evidence for their position, presented not evidence that Zimmerman attacked Martin, but evidence that Zimmerman behaved provocatively by profiling Martin, thus justifying Martin chimping out on Zimmerman.
They claimed to believe that Zimmerman attacked Martin, but as evidence for this supposed belief presented grounds for Martin to attack Zimmerman.

Pretty much everyone who thought Zimmerman guilty, and pretty much everyone who prematurely condemned the Duke Lacrosse team on the testimony of a lying drunken thieving violent black whore who was trying to talk her way out of a yet another charge of violent drunken assault in a long history of violent drunken assaults and stupid violent thefts, believes that blacks have right to chimp out on whites because all whites are guilty of racism, believe that whites make Africa and Detroit poor, and that if only whites were eliminated other races would have all the stuff that whites have.
That was implicit in the arguments we heard for the guilt of Zimmerman, and implicit in the arguments we heard for the premature conviction of the Duke Lacrosse team.
Pretty much everyone who has been educated in Harvard believes that if only whites were eliminated other races would have all the stuff that whites have.
When Obama says "You did not build that", what near fifty percent of the voters hear is that wealth just springs forth from the magic dirt, and due to racism, white people get it all.
When the BLM burns down a supermarket that whites built and beats up the whites that built it, and that supermarket is not promptly replaced by a supermarket run by black women that gives out stuff for free, they think that the reason they were not given a supermarket the way white males supposedly were given ("You did not build that") is racism.
They are outraged and indignant that they do not get a new supermarket the way that Obama told them whites got a new supermarket.
That is the worldview taught in Harvard, and its logical implication is that all whites should be murdered.
Harvard, and Obama, preach slogans that like "liquidation of the kulaks as a class" preserve a careful ambiguity between erasing white culture and civilization, and erasing whites physically. Harvard engages in symbolic acts erasing white civilization, but when these symbolic acts get down to their vote bank, the mass of the voters hear Harvard instigating the physical erasure of whites, that the physical erasure of whites is desirable and morally right.

By your deeds, you admit the reality that the differences between races on many important matters are greater than the usual differences between one member of that race and another member of that race - that in many important matters the differences in behavior between one race and another are greater than a standard deviation.
I bet you, or more likely your parents, spend a great deal of money to live in a place where there are no blacks.
In America, nearly every white who can afford to, lives in a place where you cannot go anywhere without a car, because fewer blacks go to places where you need cars to go to, and where all the public spaces are in fact private, like shopping malls, so that private security can deal with blacks who act up.
In America, there are some hip white people who live in vibrant zones, but they are mostly young and male, thus better able to defend themselves, and mostly single, and thus disproportionately gay, because they would not like to expose wives and children to such danger.
Under Obama, gentrification has been reversed by ethnic cleansing.
Recall that YouTube video about a woman walking around in New York city and being harassed by males - "10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a Woman"
It would have been more accurately captioned "10 Hours of Walking in NYC as a White"  There were a bunch of reply videos that showed that a woman could walk for ten hours in white areas and have no problems.
In areas where there are vibrants, no white person uses the buses, because a white taking a bus will be beaten up.
Remember all that stuff about sending black people to the back of the bus.  You wanted integrated buses, but instead got buses with no whites.
If you look at black countries where blacks are doing OK, they have simple laws harshly enforced, for example Botswana.  For blacks to thrive, they need to live under laws substantially different from those that enable whites to thrive.
This is pretty obvious in schools, where a disciplinary process that is fine for whites results in total chaos and major brutal violence in black schools.  For blacks to get an education, they need to be whipped from time to time.  Any black parent with an intact well functioning family will tell you that.  And that is pretty much what the Botswanan police will tell you.

I earlier pointed out how having blacks under the same laws and legal system as whites has been a disaster for blacks and a disaster for whites, resulting in a situation where for a white person to form a family, he has to spend a fortune on staying away from blacks.  Blacks cannot thrive under a legal system designed for whites. They need harsher and simpler laws like those of Burundi, and blacks cannot learn much in school without being whipped, as the chaos of black schools demonstrates.  To thrive, blacks need simpler and harsher laws, more brutally enforced, that whites.
But there is a another big difference between blacks and whites: Family Just about every white man, as near all of them as makes no difference, makes a huge effort to be a father to his children, in the face of a legal system that attempts to impose black style families on whites.
Almost no black men, as near none of them as makes no difference, make much effort to be a father to their children.
It was wrong of us to attempt to impose white style families on black people back in the 1950s, and it is wrong of us to impose black style families on white people today.
We should have one set of laws, African style marriage, for blacks reproducing, and a different set of laws, traditional European style marriage, for whites reproducing.

In practice, the consequences of applying the same laws in the same way to people of different races are so disastrous that even progs have one hundred and one hypocritical and ingenious ways of ensuring that different races are subject to different laws, de facto and de jure.
For example, obviously alcohol should be legal for whites, and illegal for feather Indians (native north Americans) and progs have one hundred and one legal rationales for making this happen, for example alcohol is commonly illegal in and near Indian reservations.
Drug laws are enforced very differently for blacks and whites, because drugs have disastrous effects on black communities, but not white communities.  Whites on marijuana do not cause problems for other people, as near to none of them as make no difference.  All blacks on marijuana cause big problems for other people, as near to all of them as makes no difference.
The closer someone's race is to apes, the worse the effect of alcohol and drugs.  This difference between races is much larger than the difference between individuals of the same race.
The difference is quite evident even with the highly evolved East Asians.  Venture capitalists usually suspect that engineers are trying to scam them (and usually engineers are trying to scam them) so they like to get drunk with the people they are considering funding, for in wine their is truth.  But even a small amount of alcohol is apt to make an East Asian badly behaved and physically ill.  So the highly evolved East Asians are reluctant to drink enough that you can rely on them to speak truth, so business deals involving East Asians tend to rely more on shared blackmail material, and less on getting drunk together.
A white engineer will cheerfully drink a lot more than an East Asian engineer, but unlike the East Asian engineer, will remain well behaved and fit as a fiddle, even though his ability and inclination to lie It is hard to get East Asian engineers drunk enough to get the truth out of them, and if you do get them drunk enough to get the truth out of them, they are likely to chuck up.
With less evolved races however, the worse alcohol affects them, the more they are inclined to drink it, lacking the self control of East Asians.
Thus in practice, even in very prog San Francisco, drug laws are enforced one way on whites, and in a very different, much harsher, way on blacks, and that is the way the black community likes it.

Even less can progs endure the disastrous consequences of applying the same laws to men and women, and they have one hundred and one hypocritical and ingenious ways of ensuring that different sexes are subject to different laws de jure, for example VAWA and Title IX, and treated very differently de facto under what is nominally the same law.
Not only is the marital contract enforced, de jure, on men but not on women, but ordinary contracts are enforced de facto on men but not on women.
Women are allowed to make their own decisions, but when those decisions go bad, as they frequently do because women are childish, illogical, irrational and emotional, white men wind up paying for the costs of decisions made by women of all races.
Libertarians and Men's Rights Activists argue that we should deal with this by demanding that women bear the costs of their own decisions, but when women were emancipated in the Victorian era, we tried that, and the result was far too many women giving birth in dark alleys in the rain, so we wound up with the disastrous system we have now, where women of all races get to make their own decisions, and white men get to pay for those decisions.
In truth, demanding that women be free to make contracts and also be held to contracts is as harsh, ridiculous, and unreasonable as demanding that children be free to make contracts and also be held to contracts, and everyone intuitively realizes this when it comes to actual practical cases, even though they claim to disagree with it in theory and in the Fertile age women therefore should always be under the tutelage of fathers or husbands.  Fertile age women who find themselves without a father or a husband should be detained in government homes for wayward girls under government supervision until they can find a husband willing to take care of them, similar to the Female Factory in late eighteenth century Australia and early nineteenth century Australia. Women in public should be under the supervision of husband or male kin, in the sense that if they behave badly it should be easy to find the responsible male and ask him to take care of the problem, just as we deal with children that misbehave in public places.

Not in half a sentence:
VAWA:  Violence Against Women Act.
effect is that in any dispute, police are required to assume the man is in the wrong and the woman in the right.
Title IX:  is a portion of the United States Education Amendments of 1972, prohibiting discrimination against women.   The major absurd effect is that women are supposed to be just as athletic as men, and if they are not, male physical activity must be punished and discouraged. Also effectively discourages teaching geometry or any area of academics were women perform egregiously worse than men, but by far the biggest and most absurd effect is on sports, because that is the area where female underperformance is most egregious.
But academic areas where women perform better than men, or it can be pretended that they do, are just fine.  Title IX prohibits discrimination against women, but not against men.  Any unequal outcomes to women's disfavor must be the result of evil hateful misogyny, but any unequal outcomes to women's favor must be the result of the fact that women are wonderful.
The practical consequence of Title IX is that despite the fact that women perform lower than men on IQ tests, and have considerably less motive than men to get an education, women are massively over represented in education.  (Which under Title IX does not count as discrimination, though any under representation of women in in any specific area, such as sports, does count as discrimination.)

Financial incentive to have a family rather than be a single parent has been tried.  Turns out that childbearing is profoundly unresponsive to merely financial incentives.
The early Victorians proceeded to emancipate women, figuring that since women were naturally virtuous and responsible, no disaster would ensue. The result, of course, was far too many women giving birth in dark alleys in the rain, eventually leading to our marginally less disastrous welfare state.   I don't have any statistics as to how many, but it was unacceptably many.
(And no, it is not the pill that made the difference.  We have had the condom since the late bronze age, and the sponge since the time of Caesar. In practice, the supposed beneficial effects of new and improved contraception, or campaigns to spread knowledge and use of contraception, only appear at the same time as the actual beneficial effects of welfare for single mothers.  The pill was effectively illegal in Japan until quite recently.  It made only a marginal difference.)
Regency period Australia had another solution to single women who were not being supervised by fathers or husbands, which solution horrifies moderns, and indeed horrified Victorians, but it undeniably worked. That solution being that you just do not allow fertile age women to follow their pussies wherever their pussies might lead. You don't allow women to sleep with men who cannot or will not marry them if pregnant, you don't allow a married woman to sleep with any man other than her husband, and you don't allow women to be disrespectful to their husbands.  You keep women under as much control as necessary to prevent sexual misbehavior.  Which turns out to be quite a lot of control.

At present three hundred million people communicate by Viber.
When you install Viber, it generates a secret key and a public key and sends the public key to Viber headquarters.
When Ann wants to message Bob, Viber headquarters sends Ann's client Bob's public key, and Bob's client Ann's public key.
And then they can message each other, no one on the network, not even Viber headquarters, can know what they are saying to each other.
Unfortunately Viber could send Ann a public key belonging to the CIA as Bob's key and Bob another key belonging to the CIA as Ann's key, and then the CIA can be in the middle as Ann and Bob send messages to each other.  Ann thinks she is sending a message to Bob, but actually she is sending it to the CIA, which then resends it to Bob.
To prevent this, to deny itself this capability, Viber could maintain a rolling global hash representing the current mapping between ids and public keys, and all past mappings between ids and public keys, and when it sends Ann the key for Bob, sends Ann the hash path connecting Bob's mapping to the current rolling hash for the entire world and all of history.
We have several mutually hostile people and organizations monitoring this rolling hash, for example the KGB, the CIA, Wikileaks, and Trump's security guy (who I think is one of his sons or grandsons). Your software picks an organization at random.  The user could intervene and pick one, or pick several, but ordinarily will not.
Suppose Viber headquarters arranges for the CIA to spy on Ann and Bob. If Ann and Bob's Viber clients have both picked the CIA for their source for the rolling hash, then they are out of luck, but if one of them has picked the KGB and the other has picked the CIA, then the one that picks the KGB will get the correct version of the rolling hash, in which case the attempted man in the middle attack will fail, and that Viber headquarters is collaborating with the CIA will be exposed to the KGB, to Ann, and to Bob.
Thus Viber could prove it is not spying on its users.

It is a lot easier, and a lot more reliable, to determine someone's race, than to determine their character.  And their race often gives a good enough prediction of certain important aspects of their character.
In particular, in the events leading to the mortgage meltdown, race was a better predictor of propensity to default on one's mortgage than any of the permissible credit characteristics.
You are walking down a dark street.  Two other people are also walking down that street.  One is a black male, one is a white male.  The black male is quite unlikely to murder you.  But if you are worried about being murdered, and you probably should be, he is one hell of a lot more likely to murder you than the white male.  About thirteen times more likely in fact.
Similarly, if you are a banker who is worried that someone is going to blow off his mortgage ... well doubtless there are a lot of blacks, probably most of those blacks with good credit ratings, who will not blow off their mortgage.  But if someone is black with a good credit rating, he is one hell of a lot more likely to blow off his mortgage than someone who is white with a good credit rating.
The more you know about a debtor, the less is race adds to accuracy of predicting the likelihood of default.  But even if you have complete credit data, race is still substantially predictive.  The chance of a white man and a black man with equal credit ratings defaulting on a mortgage is far from equal.
Similarly, if a white man and a black man both have long and horrible criminal records, they are about equally likely to murder you.  But if a white man and a black man both have minor criminal records, the chance that the black man will go on to commit murder is far from equal.

Races are by definition not distinct.  If they were truly distinct, they would by definition be species, not races.
Races are, as Darwin explained, the origin of species.
Because fertility between kinds gradually diminishes as they become more and more different, and even radically different kinds often have some limited interfertility, there is no sharp line between a species difference and a race difference.
But if interfertility is definitely zero (which is less common than you would think - you can get some mighty surprising hybrids) then it is definitely a species difference.
As Darwin explained, the origin of species is that different races are exposed to different selective pressures, and over time tend to become more different, resulting in gradual diminution of interbreeding and Darwin's account of speciation - that speciation is usually and primarily sympatric - has been confirmed by studies of speciation in fish, in particular sticklebacks, and studies of speciation in The counter theory is Gould's punctuated equilibrium, which is the scientific justification for your pseudo scientific babble.
Gould invented punctuated equilibrium in order to have a pseudo scientific theory proving that all men are created equal, since Darwin's account of speciation implies that the processes that create races create inequality.
So people looked into Gould's theory, and it was disconfirmed, and Darwin's horribly racist account of speciation (that sympatric speciation is normal, gradual, common, and happening everywhere all the time) confirmed - at least for numerous non mammalian kinds.

After the horrifying bloodbaths of the twentieth century, the doctrines of equality and demotism should be thoroughly and utterly discredited, should be seen as outrageous, shocking, and evil.
Yet strangely, they are not.
I notice that the Democrats are working their way towards rationalizing nuclear war with Russia, since a hundred million human sacrifices to equality and social justice during the twentieth century were not enough.  They have a lot of overly clever and excessively complicated rationales, but the real reason is this:
Razer sells out to the left because the arc of history supposedly is But Russia, instead of turning prog after communism, shows strong signs of turning to the faith that used to be known as Christianity before progs reinvented Christianity as yet another form of proggism.   Maybe the arc of history is not ever leftwards.  Maybe left wing movements go ever leftwards till they end catastrophically.  Maybe the arc of history peaked at Pol Pot.
Razer hears a voice in his head telling him he has sold his soul and has been speaking power to truth.
Razer wants Russia nuked to make the arc of history go the way it is supposed to so that terrible voice in his head will stop saying terrible things about him.  Nuking Russia is motivated by the same motives as "Never Trump" - that if leftist victory is not inevitable, then it is all a lie, and leftists lose status.
The US sponsored coup to seize the Ukraine is a symptom, not a cause. The actual cause is that Russians treat Pussy Riot as beggars, gypsies, whores, tramps, and thieves, as low status.
The US believes that when Pussy Riot barges into a Cathedral and vandalizes it, the Christians should stop being offensive to Pussy Riot, rather than that Pussy Riot should stop being offensive to Christians, because Pussy Riot is high status and Christians are low status - and if Pussy Riot is low status, then people who post equalist piety to this list are low status, and therefore razer is low status, therefore, they think, Russia needs to be nuked, in order that razer and other people who post off topic equalist crap to this list can be high status.

Well, of course, there is FORTH, the world's smallest operating system, development environment, assembler, compiler, and metacompiler.
You start by programming the bootstrap in binary, and the bootstrap then assembles and compiles an increasingly powerful assembler, compiler, and Of course FORTH relies heavily on the developer to do tasks that are more suited to the operating system or the compiler, making it of limited value for programs larger than 32K or so and disks larger than ten megabytes or so, though Forth can theoretically address disks as large as two hundred and fifty six megabytes. Also file deletion in Forth is not really practical.  But if you have enough Forth related stuff that you need to worry about deletion on a ten megabyte disk, your Forth environment is already too big and complex.
But it would be not too difficult to have Forth compile a common lisp interpreter, the common lisp interpreter generate a C compiler, the C compiler generate a common lisp compiler and a C++ compiler, the C++ compiler and the Forth compiler generate an actually useful operating system, and there you are.

Here is a collection of the latest on the incident.
tl;dr  Leftists beat up a shitload of people.  Guy who got shot had brass knuckles and a big knife.  Employed the brass knuckles to beat up lots of people.  Got shot as a result.
Look at the video:
A short middle aged Asian man in a yellow hat is minding his own business when an a big antifa races out of the crowd, attacks him and beats him up, one of the many, many, many attacks on real, suspected, alleged, or imaginary rightists that have been happening since Trump was elected.  He chases the short guy in the yellow hat all over the place, a bunch of other antifa joined in or are about to join in, then the short Asian guy in the yellow hat shoots the antifa, or possibly a trump supporter in a red hat shoots the antifa to protect the short Asian guy in the yellow hat.
The guy who got shot is not a union organizer, but a union enforcer.  He is an antifa, one of the people in the left who maintain the ideological uniformity of the left by beating up and frequently murdering fellow leftists who deviate from the latest line.
It is not yet clear who did the shooting, and whose side the Asian guy was on, but it is clear who was shot, and whose side he was on. Regardless of who did the shooting, the shooting was defense against a left wing ideological enforcer who was doing a bit of enforcement.
The second amendment is the ultimate defense of the first.
There have been thousands of vicious attacks on real and suspected Trump supporters, and very little of it is getting coverage.

We saw on video, several videos, this union organizer pursue and attack a man much smaller than himself, and with the aid of his brass knuckles and several of his friends beat the crap out of that man.
He was in possession of brass knuckles and large knife, and since the brass knuckles saw plenty of use on the video, I suppose the knife was also used on less public occasions, that being the usual way the left does political organization and maintains ideological uniformity.
The reason people are all quiet about this incident, while they made a big deal about George Zimmerman shooting a small time mugger and burglar, is that it was all recorded on video from multiple angles. There is absolutely no doubt whatever that whoever the man being attacked was, and whoever fired the gun, the man who got shot was committing a felony, was shot to prevent him from continuing to commit that felony, and is a leftist political enforcer whose job it is to enforce leftism the way it is always enforced: by violence.

It is the Trumpening.
Tulsi Gabbard was always a thorn in the side of the Blue Empire, but she started speaking truth to power when Trump was elected.
Tulsi Gabbard is described as a Combat Veteran.  Normally, of course, women in combat are whores, cowards, and traitors, but Tulsi Gabbard, though forced to dress in men's clothes, did not pretend to shoot at the enemy, did not pretend to be a warrior, but instead bravely and patriotically took care of warriors injured on the battlefield, a proper role for a brave and patriotic woman, which role exposed her to real danger, though of course less danger than an actual warrior, as is only proper, for women are the precious sex, while men are the expendable sex.
However in our degenerate era, women who perform their proper roles in war and battle are forced to dress as men, and get men's job descriptions, when they should be classed as camp followers, and given more flattering costumes.
Eighty percent of our army, including all the women and nearly all the nonwhites, should be reclassified as camp followers, rather than soldiers.
Which does not make anything Tulsi Gabbard did any the less honorable, brave, and patriotic, despite being forced to dress as a trannie pervert.

In general, what do libertarians do when the other guys organize collective violence on the basis of race, religion, or ideology?
It is not just actual states, like Islamic state.  Any cohesive religion or ethnicity can and frequently does do stuff that is somewhat like what a state can do.  As for example recent drastic reversals of gentrification by black people collectively engaged in activities that are rather close to ethnic cleansing of whites.
Conversely, any functional state is held together by a ruling tribe, ethnicity, religion, or ideology, and if the ruling tribe loses cohesion, or people lose faith in the ruling ideology or religion, the state is apt to fall apart.
Orthodox Jews have enclaves in places where most nonblacks would find it difficult because they can engage in collective defense against blacks without being deemed nazis and fascists.
Cohesive groups can predate on incohesive categories and frequently do. If you find a cohesive group is predating on you, what are you going to do?

Usually through tribalism, ethnic identity, ideology, or shared
religion.  Religion is how Mohammed did it.
And what happens if men do not come to be a nation, or just cease to
be nation, perhaps because of loss of tribal or religious identity?

of Detroit and the inner city.  White Swedish chicks get pregnant by
brown or black Muslims and white male taxpayers who cannot get laid
pay for other men's children.
A people with high asabiyyah, like the pagan Icelanders, can get by
without a central government, provided that they are proud, brave, and
valiant warriors, but when Christianity arrived, things fell apart.
Something like anarcho capitalism worked for the pagan Icelanders,
because they had a state religion without a state, because their
religion gave them strong social cohesion.  When universalist

So let me define instead a donald tree.   :-)  (just kidding)
A donald tree is a tree where every node contains the hash of its immediate children.  Thus the hash of the root of any subtree guarantees the contents of all its descendants, just as the hash of a file guarantees the contents of the entire file.
This means that we can keep on adding to the tree, while keeping the past immutable, which is a useful feature for tracking who owns what, and who owes what.  If many people see the current hash at time X, you cannot change details about the past of time X without revealing what you have been up to.
Any tree can be severely unbalanced, for example a binary tree where every node has a right hand child, and very few nodes have a left hand child, in which case the depth of the tree is approximately proportional to the total number of nodes in the tree - and the tree grows to enormous depth when the total number of node is enormous.
Or it can be approximately balanced, in which case the depth of the tree is approximately proportional to the log of the number of nodes, which is always a reasonably small number even if the number of nodes is enormous.
And a hash that testifies to every transaction that anyone ever did is going to be the hash of an enormous number of nodes.  But if it is at the root of a tree of moderate depth, then we can validate any part of the tree for conformity with the rules without validating the entire tree for conformity to the rules.

It was designed from the beginning for the purpose, hence the excellent integration between the posting and commenting, which is analogous to WordPress, and the private messaging, which is analogous to skype. Facebook is pretty much Skype+WordPress, and all the others are competing for the same market niche, though Facebook totally dominates the sexual assignation and booty call niche by far.
Specialist systems, for example the Cupid system for international dating have the same basic architecture - posts plus tightly integrated private messaging.
The trouble is that the major systems, especially twitter, are heavily politicized and censored, and so people are forming alt-tech, such as Gab, to escape from politics and censorship.
If you want to read a science paper about the nut gathering activities of the gray squirrel, or an adventure comic about the Mighty Thor, or a science fiction story about flash Gordon traveling to the far stars, you instead get politics.
You think you are reading about the nut gathering activities of the gray squirrel, and it turns into the effect of global warming on the gray squirrel, which effect we are told is extremely bad, though no concrete evidence of this is provided, the evils of global warming upon the squirrel being asserted but not actually shown.
But it is not actually about the effect of global warming on the gray squirrel, rather it is about global warming itself. We are told that global warming is even worse than we thought, though how bad we used to think it was is never precisely specified, and how bad now we think it is not specified either, and the evidence that we should now think it even worse is alluded to rather than given.
But it is not actually about global warming itself, rather it is that the industrial civilization that white people created is destroying the But it is not actually about the destruction of the earth by white civilization, rather it is that heterosexual white males are horribly bad, and extremely harmful to all other kinds of creatures.
Similarly, when one read the adventures of Thor, one encounters female Thor.  But it is not actually about female Thor, it is that gender binary is false and evil.  But it is not actually about gender binary, it is that ... heterosexual white males are horribly bad, and extremely harmful to all other kinds of creatures.
And similarly, when Flash Gordon travels to the far stars, it turns out that an evil corporation run by white heterosexual patriarchal males is oppressing blue skinned tree living aliens to steal their natural resources ... bad, and extremely harmful to all other kinds of creatures.
This endless insulting, ignorant, stupid, and offensive hectoring happens all the time, everywhere, on every topic, in every medium, on every platform, from Facebook to Twitter, from Scientific American to Marvel comics, from romance novels to first person shooter games, and if you complain, you are racist, sexist, homophobic, Islamophobic, and a denier and you get banned.  Observe for example that the only people allowed to be good fathers on television or the comics are blacks, and even black males are still required to have broken families.  Evidently the depiction of a good father ruling over a happy family is homophobic, bastardphobic, sexist, racist, whatever.
Recall that the movie "Man in a high castle" used a happy intact family on its poster as a symbol of Nazism. We are so accustomed to being lectured, shouted at, and spat upon that the shouting is felt to be normal and non political, and any easing up of the shouting and the spitting, as for example a science fiction writer who gives us a science fiction story rather than a lecture, is deemed to be extreme right wing politics.  If you hoist an umbrella against the spit, you are a Nazi and you are planning to murder the Jews.  And you probably really are a Nazi and probably really are planning to murder the Jews, because only really hard cases like actual Nazis planning to murder actual Jews are willing to defy public opinion by hoisting an umbrella against being spat upon.
To deal with this problem, people are developing alt tech, for example gab.ai, which is Twitter without mandatory left wing propaganda all the time on every topic.  Similarly 8chan is a reaction to the endless tedious left wing agitation and fierce censorship of 4chan
The most interesting conversations are happening on secretive invitation only sites, because it is only safe to say true things on a secretive invitation only site.
So, what I am thinking of is a way to integrate secretive invitation only sites in a messaging network of public sites.
It would be nice if when you clicked on a commenters id, you got a link to his posts, and to his comments on other people's posts - but if some of these posts and comments were on invitation only sites, you would only see those comments and posts if you were able to browse those sites, if you could have seen those comments and posts without necessarily following the link, and, more importantly, only be able to detect the existence of such comments and posts if you were able to browse those sites.  Even if you were using special software, not the regular client but a hostile client, you should not be able to detect that the commenter posts to secretive websites, or that such websites exist.

You would have a point if there was one virtuous white father in Marvel comics presiding over a happy intact family.  You would have a point if, like the original superman, superheroes usually came from happy intact families and internalized and expressed the moral code they learned from their wise and good fathers.
The trouble is that the disgusting, the destructive, the self destructive, and the evil is the norm, and the good and the normal is absolutely nowhere to be seen.
It is all like girly Thor, all the time.  Not that specific sexual deviation, but there is always some deviation.  There is always something wrong. Right is presented as wrong, and wrong as right.  It all politics all the time, overruling and disrupting story, plot, and character development.

The courts are corrupt.  We need Duterte's solution to judicial corruption and lawlessness.
The courts are no substitute for a disciplined police force - it is easier for judges to get away with wicked, abusive, and corrupt behavior than it is for police.  As for example patent law and the silicone lawsuits.
The various protections for criminals are part of an endless effort to get black conviction and imprisonment rates down to white levels, thus in practice these protections apply to black criminals, not to law abiding cishet whites.  Consider, for example the conviction of Martha Stewart, supposedly for insider trading - but what she was actually convicted of was obstruction of justice, which she obstructed by not confessing to things that they they could not prove her guilty of.
She sold a bunch of shares just before bad news hit, which is illegal if you know the bad news because of your insider position, and have neglected to make it public before you sell the adversely affected shares.
But they could not prove that she knew the bad news before she sold the shares, so she was in fact convicted for obstructing injustice, convicted her for not confessing to a crime that they plausibly suspected, but were never able to prove.
Compare the Martha Stewart case to a recent supreme court case, where some blacks in a car doing a drug deal drove in a reckless and dangerous manner, because they were distracted by the drug deal.  The supremes ruled that though police could ordinarily arrest them for dangerous driving, and, surprise surprise, find the drugs, it was improper to do that in this case because the dangerous driving arrest might be motivated by the fact that they saw them dealing drugs, and seeing them dealing drugs has been deemed insufficient grounds for search.
Had police not noticed the drug deal going down, then they could have arrested them for dangerous driving and found the drugs.  But because police saw the drug deal going down, the drugs that they found were ruled inadmissable.
If you are doing a characteristically black crime, police are not allowed to see what is right in front of them.  If you are suspected of doing a characteristically white middle class crime, you are subject to the most lawless and arbitrary inquisition.

I have asked this question, how to do a secret handshake that reveals common membership of the group without giving away your membership to non members, several times before, and not been happy with the answers, so I guess I am asking it badly.
I will try to be clearer about the problem I am trying to solve.
These days, people no longer communicate on Usenet and email lists. Rather they use something for which we have not formed a word. I will call it a social blogging platform, unless someone has a better word.
Twitter, Facebook, and to a lesser extent WordPress, and such are all examples of this.
In a blogging platform, you post and people comment on your post. WordPress is the classic example
Plus, it is a communication medium, you can chat privately to people and groups, like viber.
Viber and skype are messenger with very little blogging, WordPress is blogging with very little messenger, Facebook is the two integrated. Viber is currently the best messaging system, WordPress the best blogging, Facebook the best integrated messaging and blogging system, but the world is moving to tighter integration.  Every messaging platform is adding some blog like features, every blogging system is adding some messaging type features.

Singapore has socialist health care and genuine free market health care.   Most people use the free market healthcare, and pay for it out of their own pockets (not quite their own pockets - out of mandatory savings accounts)
It is best healthcare system in the world.  The prices are fairly similar to the free market health care sectors in India and Thailand.
When government guarantees free healthcare for everyone, the hospitals get overrun by bums seeking a free bed and free meals, and by drug addicts seeking free drugs, as for example in Canada.  And then the government starts bumping off old people to make room.
The problem in America today is that lots of people get free healthcare, and these people go in by the same door, and see the same triage nurse as you do, so there is always a long queue of bums and drug addicts in front of you running up the cost of healthcare.
If you are not prepared to let bums and drug addicts drop dead, you wind up bumping off retirees.  Which is the Obamacare crisis. Ann Coulter cannot buy health insurance at any price, because bums and drug addicts are in front of her.
She can buy what Obama calls health insurance, but it does not cover cancer, broken legs, etc, and has extremely high deductibles, so is effectively not health insurance.  And that is the collapse of Obamacare.

And then, people got used to using bank notes, and came to trust banks. Until the US started to run out of gold.  Whereupon Nixon said that US dollars were money, and gold was not money, and sort of got away with saying that.

And people said that gold was not money, and for a while, it seemed like it might be true, that gold was not money, that only the US dollar was But somehow, gold never really stopped being money, and after a while people gave up on saying that gold was not money.

Fine: What black man was put to death without legal authority unjustly?
Name him.
Or, if you want to define every murder of a black man as lynching, let us start counting whites murdered by blacks as compared to blacks murdered by whites.
If you want to count every murder of a black as lynching, observe that there are approximately five hundred white people killed by blacks every The number of black people killed by whites, counting whites as hispanic is roughly comparable, about two hundred per year, but there is a big difference, a huge difference, in the character of the killings:  Almost every black man killed by a white man was engaged in a felony at the time he was killed.  Only about one non felonious black is killed by a "white" man (actually hispanic) per year.

Someone wants a new feature, similar to the existing features, and the easy way to do it is not to properly factorize the existing code, but to copy and paste a huge pile of code that provides an existing feature, and make a few minor changes in this huge pile of code, so that it provides the new feature rather than the existing feature.
This is very bad.  Further it is true that PHP is a language for stupid people. - well not stupid people, for there are no stupid engineers, but engineers that are substantially less smart than other engineers, like the guys they bring over from India to work for slave wages. Indians tend to be not so bright, and people who work for slave wages tend to be not so bright, so when your company goes looking for cheap code monkeys, it gets what it deserves.

Edison himself personally with his own hands built the prototype for the first light bulb that was sufficiently useful and sufficiently buildable that people could and did buy it to light their facilities, which light bulb was substantially based on the work of Swan, who also built prototypes with his own hands.  The first light bulbs that you could actually buy were produced by a company owned and run by Edison and Swan, and everyone who actually built the early light bulbs that were actually sold learned how to build them at the feet of Edison and Swan.
Just as the first junction transistor was built by Shockley with his own hands, and every single person in the entire world today who builds transistors learned at the feet of someone who learned at the feet of someone who learned at the feet ... of Shockley.

Emmett Till was not lynched, he was quietly and furtively murdered for the same reasons and in the same way as lots of white people are furtively and quietly murdered today.  Hitting on someone else's girl, or merely being alone in private with someone else's girl remains today one of major causes of murder.
If you had one plausibly innocent black victim of lynching, in all of the United States, in the entire history of the United States, you would not be reduced to the absurdly desperate expedient making the victim of an entirely routine murder your poster boy.
A lynching is conducted openly in public by high status people who believe themselves, and are believed by others, to be defending the community.  Emmett Till, on the other hand, quietly vanished, and his hidden corpse was later discovered.

Presumably there is a distinction between being "put to death" and furtively bumped off in a dark alley.
Fine: What black man was put to death without legal authority unjustly?
Name him.
Or, if you want to define every murder of a black man as lynching, let us start counting whites murdered by blacks as compared to blacks murdered by whites.
If you want to count every murder of a black as lynching, observe that there are approximately five hundred white people killed by blacks every The number of black people killed by whites, counting whites as hispanic is roughly comparable, about two hundred per year, but there is a big difference, a huge difference, in the character of the killings:  Almost every black man killed by a white man was engaged in a felony at the time he was killed.  Only about one non felonious black is killed by a "white" man (actually hispanic) per year.

Today, blacks are killed by whites in the course of that black man committing a crime.  In the days of lynchings, a lynching consisted of killing a black man after he committed a serious crime, instead of while he was committing a crime.

The work for which Ada is most famous consists of writing up Babbage's algorithm descriptions.  She did not create them herself, but from Babbage's notes.
Babbage hired her to generate publicity for his difference engine because she was famous, and she was famous because she was a *female* scientist and mathematician, as a dancing bear is famous not for dancing well, but for dancing at all.
Grace Hopper cause Cobol to be created, a language infamous for being bad, but popular with authority figures.  She issued a bunch of extremely bad specifications, reflecting what authority figures who do not understand computing are likely to mistakenly think that they want, and then programmers who were actually competent then gave effect to her incompetent and bad idea.
There are no great female scientists.  If there were you would not have been reduced to giving Marie Curie not one but two Nobel prizes for work that no male would have received a Nobel prize for.  (For the similar but far more important discovery of Radon made at about the same time got no Nobel prize), work that she did as the least important member of a team of three scientists, all of them greater than her, and yet the two males did not get the Nobel prize.
There is one great female mathematician, Noether, of whom it was said "I can testify that she is a great mathematician, but that she is female I am far from sure."

I have written in PHP.  Large PHP projects get out of control, develop a great deal of almost duplicated code.  And then you want to change something, and you have to find every piece of almost duplicated code, and make the same change everywhere, and you don't, or cannot.
Someone wants a new feature, similar to the existing features, and the easy way to do it is not to properly factorize the existing code, but to copy and paste a huge pile of code that provides an existing feature, and make a few minor changes in this huge pile of code, so that it provides the new feature rather than the existing feature.
This is very bad.  Further it is true that PHP is a language for stupid people. - well not stupid people, for there are no stupid engineers, but engineers that are substantially less smart than other engineers, like the guys they bring over from India to work for slave wages. Indians tend to be not so bright, and people who work for slave wages tend to be not so bright, so when your company goes looking for cheap code monkeys, it gets what it deserves.
There is a well known old programming joke "You can write Fortran in any language".  I suppose that today, now that no one writes in Fortran, the joke is not funny any more.  What it means is that you can always write C in C++.
Most languages, especially Lisp and C++ provide support for very clever ways of programming, clever ways of dealing with the kind of almost-the-same-but-slightly-different feature that in PHP leads to massive code duplication.  PHP does not provide the kind of tools that a clever programmer makes heavy use of.  Which is part of the reason you find that in a big PHP the same change has to be made in a hundred different places, in a hundred pieces of almost-but-not-quite identical PHP tends to be written by stupid people, because clever people notice the lack of certain features, tools, idioms more than stupid people, and tend to be the people that make heavy use of those features, tools, and

It is not exactly a hoax.  Rather, they cherry pick the evidence, torture the data, use nonsensical statistical methods, and reject unwanted evidence as error, as for example The Hockey stick curve is not exactly a lie.  Rather, what they did is use an estimate for recent twentieth century warming, and took any data that correlated with that during the twentieth century, declared anything that correlated to be a proxy for temperature, and took the weighted average of all these "proxies"
Since they were, for the most part, not measures of temperature, they tended to cancel out except for the period where they had been selected for correlating, thus producing a hockey stick.
If your data is random noise, and you select those noise sequences that rise from 1970 to 1990, and take their average, you get a hockey stick blade from 1970 to 1990, and everything before 1970 flat, *and* *everything* *after* *1990* flat, because except for the period on which you are selecting, everything cancels out.
Of course, as time passed, they proceeded to once again cancel out, so the hockey stick curve developed a sudden dip - the proxies were reporting that the earths temperature was falling back to its long term average - not because it was falling back, but because these proxies were not in fact proxies, but just random noise.

Each substring constitutes a vector in a space of enormously high dimension, the space of all possible strings of moderate length.

Two identical substrings in two separate documents will be mapped to the same vector in the space of moderate dimension.
Each document is then given a position in the space of moderately high dimension by summing all the vectors, and then normalizing the resulting vector to length one.
Thus each document is assigned a position on the hypersphere in the space of moderately high dimension.
If two different documents contain some identical substrings, will tend to be closer together.

Seventy thousand years of evolution since Africa.
The white race is only ten thousand years old, the East Asian race not much older.
The original settlers from Africa were very different from us and from today's black Africans.  Seventy thousand years is a long time.
The white race originated from a mingling of brownish brown eyed farmers from what is now the middle east, and blue eyed hunted gatherers of unknown skin color and hair color, probably red haired and yellowish brown skinned, a combination that never occurs in moderns, in Eastern Europe or Siberia, originating from what is now Europe. Neither of these races corresponded all that much to any present day race.
The blue eyed Siberian people were descended from the same race that did the cave paintings in Europe. The hunter gatherers retreated from the farmers, then, in Eastern Europe or Siberia, mingled with them and took up cattle herding with cattle dogs.  The cattle herders then re-entered Europe in repeated waves of genocidal conquest, pretty much eradicating the farmer people that originally farmed Europe.

Assume that, instead of everyone being a peer, we have two dozen or so peers, the peers distributed among several nuclear armed jurisdictions, and each peer has a hundred million or so clients.
OK, we are talking rather large peers.  A terabyte of storage, a hundred dollars worth, will keep one of them going for a week.  I don't think cost of storage is going to be a significant problem.
Scaling, however, is the hard problem.  Making enormous amounts of storage actually useful and effective is the problem.  The amount of storage per client is absolutely insignificant.  The amount of bandwidth per client is absolutely insignificant.  Having a useful connection between enormous numbers of clients and enormous amounts of storage is the hard part.

Suppose you have an undirected graph in which every vertex is connected to at least three other vertexes (because we collapse vertices with only one connection or two connections)
Now suppose we want to make sure that the total graph is well connected - that every subgraph is connected to at least three vertexes of the rest of the graph.  We want to collapse subgraphs that are only connected to the rest of the graph by one connection into the vertex by which they are connected, and collapse subgraphs that are only connected to rest of the graph by two connections into a single edge.
And suppose our graph is very large, thousands, perhaps millions, of Purported peers that have only one connection are clients of the entity to which they are connected, and he is responsible for their good behavior, similarly those that have only two connections.  Three good peer connections make you a peer of all the other peers, two good connections do not make you a peer - don't get equal treatment to the vertices by which you are connected, get graylist treatment.

Seventy thousand years of evolution since Africa.
The white race is only ten thousand years old, the East Asian race not much older.
The original settlers from Africa were very different from us and from today's black Africans.  Seventy thousand years is a long time.
The white race originated from a mingling of brownish brown eyed farmers from what is now the middle east, and blue eyed hunted gatherers of unknown skin color and hair color, probably red haired and yellowish brown skinned, a combination that never occurs in moderns, in Eastern Europe or Siberia, originating from what is now Europe. Neither of these races corresponded all that much to any present day race.
The blue eyed Siberian people were descended from the same race that did the cave paintings in Europe. The hunter gatherers retreated from the farmers, then, in Eastern Europe or Siberia, mingled with them and took up cattle herding with cattle dogs.  The cattle herders then re-entered Europe in repeated waves of genocidal conquest, pretty much eradicating the farmer people that originally farmed Europe.

What you think it means is a myth.
Modern humans and modern chimps are both descended from a group of chimp like creatures that lived in Africa.  That does not make chimps human, nor does it necessarily make black Africans human.
That black Africans are human is a fact about scientific nomenclature, not a fact about biology.  They are human because Charles Darwin did not feel like drawing a line down the middle of the Sahara.

The supposedly Jewish tradition that girls were not women is far from ancient.  Nineteenth century at earliest.
Ancient Judaism, fourth century, had no lower age limit on marriage, and generally dealt with sexual misconduct by shotgun marrying the offenders, ("sanctifying" them) regardless of age, including female offenders as young as three.  It was youthful male offenders who were excused from marriage on the grounds that it was obviously physically impossible for them to have done what they seemed to be doing.
That supposedly ancient tradition is twenty first century.  It is not even twentieth century.  Rabbis are always inventing ancient traditions as of last week, and falsely attributing them to some ancient source.
The Sadducees were complaining about this rabbinical creativity back in second temple times, and the rabbis have been at it ever since the Maccabees lost their grip, endlessly and rapidly re-inventing the past of judaism, usually in accord with current year values.

This supposedly ancient tradition seems to be nineteenth century with some rather thin justifications claiming it is twelfth century.
It is clearly post biblical.  It was not in effect during the fourth century, when in the event of real or reasonably suspected sexual misconduct, the offenders got "sanctified" like it or not.
Women rather like serial monogamy.  If women get sexual choice, if they are free to always be on the prowl to trade up, rather than stuck with the first guy they have sex with, you get women defecting on men, men respond by defecting on women first (spin plates) in the reasonable expectation that women are likely to defect on them, so you always need a few spares in the kitty.
So, have to enforce on women the old testament rule that they are stuck with the first guy they have sex with.
If you enforce that rule, then in an alarmingly large minority of cases, you will find that the first guy they have sex with, they have sex with him at a disturbingly young age, Disney  princess age, well before puberty.
Thus societies that attempt to enforce that rule tend to lock up their daughters starting one or two years before Disney princess age, but this fails surprisingly often, so if you attempt enforce virgin marriage, you really have to allow marriage long before puberty in problem cases, and indeed quite forcefully impose marriage long before puberty in a minority of problem cases.

Trump's vulgarity conveys a vital and important truth.
No one gets charged with rape for actually raping women, no one gets charged with sexual harassment for actually sexually harassing women.
If you are sufficiently alpha, you *can* grab them by the pussy.
Casual observation and common sense is that all charges of sexual harassment are lustful women shit testing hapless timid men, and those timid men failing their shit tests.
This anecdotal evidence is confirmed by statistical evidence, in that female majority workplaces have a much larger proportion of females claiming sexual harassment than male majority workplaces.
Similarly, most rape complaints are actually lack of rape complaints.
The university of Virginia dealt with a big pile of rape and sex complaints, and dismissed every single one without disciplinary action. So Rolling Stone investigated University of Virginia looking for poster girls and trouble, came up empty.
Worse than empty, came up with what was very obviously some woman's rape fantasy.  As I said when the "rape on campus" article first appeared, it read as if typed up one handed.  Reading the article, it was obvious that if there really was a college fraternity of high status white males who were so high status they could get away with brutally and savagely glass raping women, and so manly that they were apt to do so, the women who wrote the article would be hanging around the frat house with glasses in both hands.
Similarly Crystal Mangum had semen from five men in her when she complained of being raped by the Lacrossw team - none of it from members of the Lacrosse team.
Chances are if the Lacrosse team had gang banged her good and hard they would have had no problems, for the guys who did gang bang her good and hard had no problems.

The cost of housing reflects the fact that deplorables, bitter clingers, and Trump voters are being driven out of the places that they built and not allowed to build new places.

Trump's vulgarity conveys a vital and important truth.
No one gets charged with rape for actually raping women, no one gets charged with sexual harassment for actually sexually harassing women.
If you are sufficiently alpha, you *can* grab them by the pussy.
Casual observation and common sense is that all charges of sexual harassment are lustful women shit testing hapless timid men, and those timid men failing their shit tests.
This anecdotal evidence is confirmed by statistical evidence, in that female majority workplaces have a much larger proportion of females claiming sexual harassment than male majority workplaces.
Similarly, most rape complaints are actually lack of rape complaints.
The university of Virginia dealt with a big pile of rape and sex complaints, and dismissed every single one without disciplinary action. So Rolling Stone investigated University of Virginia looking for poster girls and trouble, came up empty.
Worse than empty, came up with what was very obviously some woman's rape fantasy.  As I said when the "rape on campus" article first appeared, it read as if typed up one handed.  Reading the article, it was obvious that if there really was a college fraternity of high status white males who were so high status they could get away with brutally and savagely glass raping women, and so manly that they were apt to do so, the women who wrote the article would be hanging around the frat house with glasses in both hands.
Similarly Crystal Mangum had semen from five men in her when she complained of being raped by the Lacrossw team - none of it from members of the Lacrosse team.
Chances are if the Lacrosse team had gang banged her good and hard they would have had no problems, for the guys who did gang bang her good and hard had no problems.

Enslavement on the basis of war was generally result of pacification campaigns, rather than "slave raids" - kings enslaved those who were persistently causing them trouble, with the objective of deterring troublemakers and getting rid of them.  As, for example, the Irish.
And most enslavement was not on the basis of war.  It was more typically for petty theft, particularly stealing from one's employer, and vagrancy.  (Not having visible means of support.)
Slavery was driven by supply, rather than demand.  It was a way of dealing with problem people.  And Africa had, and still has, more problem people.

Kill (or expel, or somehow make sure that everyone from group X is just not around any more) is a very common tactic, and one that is with great regularity hugely successful.
It gets massively under reported, because it embarrasses the winners. But if you look at demographics and voting patterns, it is obvious that there has been a huge amount of it going on, and it works just great for group not-x.

In any situation where it is probable that group x is going to do us, we need to do them first.

No one is motivated to reduce the likelihood of this tactic being used, as long as one side gets deemed to be good guys when they use it, and the other side bad guys when they resist it.

Turns out that the typical highly trained female "soldier" is more than one standard deviation below the typical male soldier in marksmanship, even though no upper body strength is required, just hand eye coordination, which you would think females would be better at.
Substantially higher variance in female marksmanship though, which means that among the very best marksmen, the difference is considerably less.
With white and black criminality, the mean for black criminality is way higher than the mean for white, but the variance is way lower.  Hence the good behavior of blacks in societies with draconian law enforcement, and the bad behavior of Harvard blacks earning six figure incomes.

I don't talk much about my personal life, because I see you guys planning to murder Christians, whites, and males, and I don't want me, my children, my lovers, or my friends to be easily identified in case they get to be the first slice in the salami slicer.
When you lot cannot find someone (and you will never find me even if you find some of my true names) you go after their kinfolk, their parents or their children if you can identify them.  And that is why I am quiet about my personal life.   My parents are dead, but I fear for my children.

Because you cannot find my home, or my children's homes.  And if you do find my home, which I am sure you will not, I am heavily armed for the eventuality that your allies show up.
Oh, and about your allies.  Recollect that the Khmer Rouge tortured the Khmer Rouge to death, that Pol Pot not only had no children, like you, but tortured to death everyone in Cambodia related to himself, and everyone he could find in Cambodia who had known him while he was young.
Famously, the Khmer Rouge hated intellectuals, especially foreign educated intellectuals - but this was because the Khmer Rouge were foreign educated intellectuals.  The left hates itself, and when it gets the power to destroy its enemies, it makes a start on destroying its enemies, and then destroys itself.  The Nazis killed thousands of commies, but the commies killed tens of millions of commies.  This has happened over and over again, and there is a good chance it will happen in the American empire before long.

Pretty sure he did read my messages, which only personally attacked you by calling your personal attacks on me "projection".  "Social Justice Warriors always project."
You asserted that I was alone and unloved, something that people of my sex and my political leanings seldom experience, and people of your sex and your political leanings regularly experience, in part because our ideology tells us that "love your neighbor" means your actual neighbor, not hostile angry people in Africa, and that our duty to close kin is greater than our duty to friends, and our duty to friends exceeds our duty to far away strangers. (1 Timothy 5:16)
And those few of us males that suffer from it are seldom much troubled. Women need to be loved much more than men, and women, having a much shorter period of sexual attractiveness and fertility than men, frequently blow their one short chance.  Men are troubled by not getting their dicks wet, by lack of sex, not by lack of love. But if they neglect to use a condom, likely to wind up getting stuck with being loved.
For a man, love is in plentiful, indeed excessive, supply, particularly if he hates condoms, just as sex is in plentiful supply for women.  If a man who feels he needs love, he has plenty of time in which to find it, whereas a woman has only a short time in which to find it, and is apt to waste her time partying, getting an education, and building a career during that terribly brief period when she should be building a family.
Because of the social environment of social justice warriors, and because of the sexual misconduct valorized by social justice warriors, female social justice warriors regularly and routinely blow their one short chance by sleeping with men who do not call them back, and by cuckolding any man so foolish as to call them back, until they stop getting nine at night booty calls from Jeremy Meeks.

Veganism has been cool for a very long time.  Indeed, the lies on saturated fat were manufactured back in the forties to give "scientific" endorsement to veganism, much as the lies on anthropogenic global warming were manufactured to give "scientific" endorsement to demonizing the technological and industrial civilization that white people created.
Indeed, veganism has recently ceased to be cool, has fallen out of fashion, which made it possible for scientists to notice that saturated fat is actually rather healthy.
The next fashion is going to be buying a young pig, killing it oneself, washing it down with caustic potash to remove the hair, shaving it oneself, gutting it oneself, and throwing a big party around the intact pig, with head and legs all together so it still looks like an animal, roasting on a spit over hot coals.  For organic trendiness, everyone will have lots of ice cold extra fizzy recently fermented high alcohol Kombucha while waiting for the roasting to finish and the pig to be served, plus some beer, coke and mountain dew for those who are not so Further, there are no strict vegans, only vegans that eat vegetables plus milk, cheese, and eggs. The strict vegans are just status posturing.  Strict veganism will make you sick or kill you, and will result in an uncontrollable raging hunger for steak, bacon, fried chicken, and so on and so forth.  Humans are obligate omnivores.  We don't have to eat veggies, though it is difficult to go without.  We do have to eat animals, or at least eat milk, cheese, and eggs in place of animals.  It is impossible to go without.
And yet you appear to believe, and enthusiastically endorse, tall tales that, if true, would justify killing me, and indeed killing Christians, whites, and males, would make killing me, people like me, and people vaguely resembling me, justifiable self defense.

And where is your wonderful anti capitalist society that did not murder a large proportion of the population, including a very large proportion of the leftists that imposed it?
Leftists hate everyone, and they hate those closer to themselves more than they hate those further from themselves.  They hate their friends, they hate their kin, they hate their family, they hate their children, and most of all, they hate themselves.   See, for example "10:10 No They reject Christian particularism, that God commanded you look after family first, then neighbors, that at Babel, the semi mythical first city, first Kingdom, and first empire, located in the area that archaeology tells us first practiced farming,  (which is logically where one would expect the first Kingdom and first empire to first appear, irrespective of whether it was actually called Babel and actually founded by Nimrod) God ordained the existence of tribes and nationalities.
And if God did not ordain them, Darwin tells us that Gnon did.  And chances are that the will of Gnon was demonstrated where farming started, when someone first tried empire.  Irrespective of whether Babel actually existed or what happened there, farming would have led to the first city, the first city likely became the first Kingdom, the first Kingdom likely became the first empire, and then the proverbial would have hit the fan.
And then, being holier than thou, leftists demonstrate that holiness by rejecting those closest to themselves even more, like the worshippers of Moloch, who demonstrated their loyalty to the state faith by casting their children into the fire.  For leftists, abortion is a sacrament. The logic of leftism starts with "invade the world, invite the world", proceeds to the murder of taxpayers and property owners, as in Detroit and Ferguson, then proceeds to white genocide, and then proceeds to The final stage of leftism is always the red terror, when leftists devour each other for insufficient holiness.

Let us recollect the Khmer Rouge.
Before 1973 the Khmer Rouge were brutal totalitarian terrorists who infamous for sometimes practicing one way portage.
You need to transport supplies from A to B, so you round up some peasants at A and have them carry your stuff to B.  You don't feed them, but you tell them there will be food and water at B.  When you arrive at B, you kill them.
And of course, most tenured academics in the western world thought they were great guys, and if any tenured academic doubted it, he remained silent.  If there was a single tenured academic in the entire western world who doubted their goodness and greatness, he remained silent.
After 1973, the Khmer Rouge were brutal totalitarian terrorists who engaged in red terror, endlessly searching for imaginary capitalists, kulaks, capitalist roaders, elitists, and CIA agents.
And of course, most tenured academics in the western world thought they were great guys, and if any tenured academic doubted it, he remained silent.  If there was a single tenured academic in the entire western world who doubted their goodness and greatness, he remained silent.
Around 1978 or so, the Khmer Rouge went far out rabid space bat crazy, torturing to death everyone who fell short of the immeasurable goodness and greatness of the Khmer Rouge, including, indeed especially, their fellow Khmer Rouge.
And of course, most tenured academics in the western world thought they were great guys, and if any tenured academic doubted it, he remained silent.  If there was a single tenured academic in the entire western world who doubted their goodness and greatness, he remained silent.
Towards the end of 1978 the Khmer Rouge were running seriously short of Khmer Rouge, and those few who remained were generally under sentence of death by torture.
And of course, most tenured academics in the western world thought they were great guys, and if any tenured academic doubted it, he remained silent.  If there was a single tenured academic in the entire western world who doubted their goodness and greatness, he remained silent.
Towards the end of December 1978, or early in January 1979, the Khmer Rouge, those of them still alive, lost power.   And then every academic everywhere felt free to criticize the Khmer Rouge.
Which they did by claiming that the Khmer Rouge had been installed in power by Ronald Reagan and the CIA.

g2s is trying to manufacture tribalism on the basis of covetousness, envy, and theft.
Libertarianism is a response to this effort
The left wing effort to turn econonomic categories into tribes was never terribly successful, and now the left is more focused on trying to generate tribalism on the basis of sexual identity and race, generate tribalism on the basis of actually existent tribes.
Which is a lot more successful.
Also a lot more likely to lead to genocide.
Libertarianism is paralyzed by this turn, which renders libertarianism Instead of stealing the bakery, or price controlling baker's inputs and outputs, they demand the baker cheer at a gay wedding.
Which, on the face of it, does not directly lead to mass murder the way stealing, covetousness, and envy does.
But fighting over status is just as likely, indeed more likely to turn deadly as fighting over stuff.
It has become apparent that there is no stopping point.  Males are just naturally superior to women in the male sphere, and white males are just naturally superior to nonwhites in most spheres.
This results in endless, and endlessly escalating efforts, to crush this natural superiority.  And this endless escalation has no stopping point but genocide.
OK, white men cannot jump and cannot dance, and our running is seriously underwhelming, but in most spheres, obviously superior.  In particular and especially, white males are superior soldiers to any other race by far. Notice the hilarious underperformance of the black posterboys of both sides in the civil war.  Similarly, notice that any military that incorporates females as soldiers never wins a war against a military that does not, irrespective of the races.  You might argue that the Vietnam war was a counter example to this, but that was a proxy war between the blue empire and the red empire, whites fighting over browns, rather than with browns.
Today's chinese art is obviously superior to today's white art, but this reflects our current decadence.  China is coming out of a dark age, while we are sliding into a dark age.   Some blame the Jews for the current undeniably crappy state of white art.  But the Chinese always had good art, even in their dark age.    We have done better in the past than now, but OK, whites are not obviously better than East Asians at art, and it is plausible that East Asians are better at art than whites.
Whites, on the other hand, are better at technological creativity than anyone, even East Asians (though the Japanese are pretty good), and, closely related to this, better at war.  The current technological superiority of East Asia is substantially dependent on white and Eurasian emigres, among them emigres fleeing the tribal violence and political repression in California and Silicon Valley.
The current white inferiority at war is the result of women in the military.   If we return to the early nineteenth century style army, where logistics are classified as camp followers rather than soldiers, and part of the duty of camp followers is getting soldier's dicks wet, where the soldiers are all male and the camp followers disproportionately female, we will return to winning.

If so, you will not get far using that argument against affirmative action.
Google up some pictures of high school valedictorians.
Observe that they are mostly brown, or female, or brown and female.  And I bet the rare light skinned males are Jews or light skinned hispanics.
If you are white and not Jewish, and you have a have a son at school, he is going to be discouraged and punished for showing ability, and for being male.
If you complain that that this is racist, if you complain when a pack of blacks who are biologically adults, even though the same chronological age as your son, beat him up, you will be called a racist, no matter how piously you condemn me.
"Racist" is just a hate word for "white".  When you call me a racist, it is no different from you calling a black man a nigger, or a Jew a kike. It is just an angry hateful word for people of a particular ethnic group.  Observe that no one called Trayvon Martin a racist even though the he indicated to his girlfriend that the fact that Zimmerman was light skinned was a major reason Martin decided to attack Zimmerman.
Because Martin Trayvon was not racist.
When a gang of blacks beat up a white man because he is white, that is not racism, that is anti racism.  Everyone instinctively calls it anti racism.  Because that is what it is.
No one is going to spontaneously call Martin Trayvon "racist" because he was in the habit of physically attacking people for being lighter skinned than himself, any more than they are going to call me "gay" for being light hearted and happy.

In context, Juan is probably referring to the claim that the Khmer Rouge murdered one hell of a lot Cambodians, and especially murdered the Khmer Rouge themselves.
The new government (nominally communist) did a house to house survey, asking people about disappearances.  Found about three million missing.
Which is consistent with what individual Cambodians I have met tell me, were telling people well before 1978 December.
Defenders of the Khmer Rouge regime claimed that was just commies defaming other commies.
The new government proceeded to dig up the killing fields.  Found a bit over two million people dumped in mass graves.
So, not entirely made up.

Fascist governments most certainly do not advocate killing their own citizenry, but are apt to define "citizen" in an alarmingly narrow fashion. From her name, I would suspect that Marina might not necessarily be defined as a citizen were a fascist government take power in America.
Left wing governments generally advocate killing class enemies, or royalists, or aristocrats, and this time around will probably advocate killing "racists" and "sexists"
At the time that they start killing people belonging to this category, no one remains who believes that they belong to this category, but pretty soon, very large numbers of people belonging to this category are And soon after that, even larger numbers of such wicked people.
And not long after that, even more.
Right wing dictatorships generally forbid interest in politics.  As Charles the first told us, politics is the King's business and no one elses.  Thus right wing political killings are necessarily self limiting.  If you start killing large numbers of people for taking excessive interest in politics, people lose interest in politics.
Left wing dictatorships generally insist on interest in politics.  The personal is political.  Which rapidly becomes terrifying, and soon after that, increasingly terrifying.  Thus left wing political repression, unlike right wing political repression, is not self limiting.
Reflect on the infamous "Dear Colleague" letter from the Obama administration, recently rescinded by the Trump administration.
The practical effect of the letter is that if a third party deems some woman has been raped the evil rapists life must be very publicly destroyed without bothering with any inconveniences like charges, investigation, or evidence.
The circumstances leading to this letter was that we established the principle that women always tell the truth about rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment.
Well, actually we established the principle that women always lie when they deny rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment, but if a woman arguably changes her story during a struggle session after three big fat hairy lesbians have been screaming in her face for two hours straight, *then* she is telling the truth.
Hence the significance of the reference to "third parties" in the Dear Colleague letter. Note that the accused cannot cross examine the complainant, or even learn who the complainant is.
Recollect that when Crystal Mangum was detained by police for drunken violence after a night of industrious whoring, she gave numerous different stories, only one of which accused the Duke University sports team of rape, but the authorities insisted on going with the story that accused the sports team.  She could easily have been steered towards a less dramatic story, or steered to claiming flying saucer abduction, or best of all, steered to confessing to drunken violence after a night of industrious whoring.  But hey, if sexual violence is on the table, women are always the victims, and men always the aggressors, even if it needs two cops to restrain the "victim".
So if police catch a drunk woman in a criminal act, she just has to say "sexual assault, domestic abuse, domestic violence", and she is golden. Just as restraining illegal immigrants who murder white people for racial reasons might deter illegal immigrants from exercising their rights, restraining drunken violent women from criminal acts might deter them from complaining about sexual harassment and sexual violence.  And we cannot have that, can we?
We also saw this principle in operation in the safe space conflict.  If someone said something that might make a member of the umpteenth gender uncomfortable, no actual complainant of the umpteenth gender need to be produced, nor any evidence that a single member of the umpteenth gender exists anywhere near the incident. And what with "microaggression" the possibility of making someone of an ever increasing number of ever smaller categories uncomfortable expands without limit.

If you talk to any Cambodian, (a lot of donut shops seem to be operated by Cambodians) you will learn that several members of his family were murdered regardless of their real or imagined politics.
Which indicates total killings of several millions, approximately consistent with the new government's house to house survey and their exhumation of the killing fields.  The testimony of any one Cambodian proves that the new government's estimates are plausible, are in the right ballpark.
If you visit the Khmer Rouge killing fields, you will be shown evidence that guards who could read numbers were replaced by innumerate guards, indicating that the former guards were killed by the same apparatus of mass murder that they themselves operated, consistent with reports that towards the end of 1978, few Khmer Rouge remained, as a result of Khmer Rouge torturing other Khmer Rouge to death.
And if you yourself did not intend to torture tens of millions of Americans to death, you would have no inclination to deny the obvious and undeniable truth about the Khmer Rouge - and every radical left regime starting with the French Revolution.

Though I suspect that you classify *everyone* on wall street as a thief, in which case you will come to a different conclusion.  If you classify them all as thieves, Jews are still disproportionately over represented, but not by nearly as much.

But just as if you allow people to commit burglary, you will find that most of your burglars look remarkably like Trayvon Martin, if you allow people to defraud investors, you will find that most of your fraudsters look remarkably like Bernie Madoff.

Maybe other scams are not so one sidely Jewish - obviously Jon Corzine's operation in European debt were not especially Jewish, and the great Mortgage meltdown was primarily "white hispanic" rather than Jewish.

But I am not terribly interested in this topic.
It is a general problem, not specifically limited to Jews, that when outsiders of group A have disproportionate power in the country of group B, they are going to behave badly to members of group B.
Therefore, Jews should not be allowed to have quasi state positions outside of Israel, and non Jews should not allowed to have quasi state positions inside of Israel.

"Hispanic" means that Angelo Mozilo got charge of a bank by affirmative action, and got other banks handed to his control by affirmative action.
Initially a white anglo guy had the real control, and Angelo Mozillo was just there for the bank to get favorable treatment by the regulators, the token minority with the big desk in the big office, but no meaningful stuff in his in tray, but then his sponsor retired, Angelo Mozilo got real charge of the bank, and totally screwed everything up.
And then he got real charge of a bunch of other banks, thanks to escalating favorable treatment by the regulators.
And then proceeded to run his bank, and the entire banking system, into the ground in the great Minority Mortgage Meltdown.  Subsequently he faced a bunch of criminal charges for numerous fraudulent activities, bribery, and corruption.  Hard to say if he was actually criminal and fraudulent, or just too hopelessly incompetent to do banking regulatory paperwork correctly and keep proper track of bank assets. (Which assets tended to disappear into his pockets and the pockets of the regulators, which tendency definitely hints at crime, fraud, and corruption, or at least a curious level of forgetfulness on his part and the part of the regulators.   Search for "Friends of Angelo" to get more details.)
You would be wrong:  CEO Citigroup who fucked up during the great mortgage minority meltdown and stole everything not nailed down, was Vikram Shankar Pandit, South Asian.
South Asians are massively over-represented when financial crime goes down, even more overrepresented than Jews.  Not that there are not plenty of Jews at Citigroup, but it seems that at Citigroup, the great Minority Mortgage Meltdown was a South Asian caper, not a Jewish caper.
Morgan Chase has a Jewish CRO, who is notoriously hostile to hasidic Jews, and notoriously ethnic nepotist towards reform Jews, but does not seem to be associated with anything obviously dishonest.

It follows there are five thousand African Americans smarter than me, fifty three thousand whites smarter than me.
But this is irrelevant, since you are committing Lewontin's Fallacy
Blacks differ from whites in many respects, not just IQ.  These differences make them inherently a separate tribe.  If they differed only in IQ, they could likely be assimilated, but they do not, one other big difference, one of many, being the propensity to criminal behavior.
Two tribes cannot coexist in the same territory.  One must rule, one must be ruled.  When we get ruled by blacks, cities burn.
Recall Obama saying "You did not build that"
Though, of course, we did build that.  Industrial civilization is the gift of whites to the world, along with the rule of law, and all that.
Now recall Juan saying what Obama said, but spelling out the implications: "a casual look at 'race' and crime shows that whites got the world record on crime."
Our crime being that we have a disproportionate share of the nice stuff, therefore, since we "did not build that", must have stolen it.
The remedy for this terrible theft being mass murder, since Juan in the same paragraph denies the crimes of the Pol Pot regime.
By the way, what race are you?  If Trayvon Martin caught you alone would he attack you on the basis of your race?
Would Obama hold the police back while a mob of blacks burned down your home and business as he did in Ferguson, because 'You did not build that".
When Ayn Rand was a young girl in Russia, you could not tell who were the looters and who were the builders by race, because the left was trying to mobilize people, tribalize people, on the basis of their relationship to the means of production.

The reason the banks needed to be bailed out was affirmative action lending, that they were pressured to lend money to illegal immigrants with no income, no job, and no assets to buy million dollar houses in the Bay Area.
It is not exactly that they were forced to do it, though the Bank of Beverly Hills was destroyed because the regulators sensed insufficient enthusiasm for the program, which seems very close to forcing them to do it, rather it was politically correct to do it, and politically correct bankers, most infamously Angelo Mozilo, were empowered by the regulators to take over less politically correct bankers.

Buying something and selling it is not theft, nor is it a scam if the thing is as it is represented to be.
The thieving scammers were those who purchased houses with no intention or ability to repay the mortgage - people who purchased houses with no assets.  And you cannot purchase a house with no assets, unless you are a beneficiary of affirmative action.
Thus precisely zero white males or married white women were thieving scammers in housing boom.
The financial crisis was the result of dud mortgages.
The dud mortgages, all of them, were affirmative action mortgages.  What drove the housing boom is that *if* *you* *were* *a* *beneficiary* *of* *affirmative* *action* *then* you could buy an expensive house despite being stone broke.
The housing boom was the result of affirmative action mortgages.
White males were involved in this process only as flipping houses with the intent of unloading the houses on affirmative action purchasers.
A white male would buy a house with the intention and capability of paying the mortgage if things went bad, but with the expectation that he could unload on an affirmative action borrower before things went bad.
And for the most part, that is exactly what we did.
And the reason we chose to do this is that we know that white males are forced to honor contracts, while affirmative action beneficiaries can walk away with no problems.
So we, unlike the end purchasers, told the truth and honored all agreements.
The housing boom was the result of affirmative action loans.  The financial crisis was the result dud mortgages.  The dud mortgages, all of them, were affirmative action loans.

Not what I see.
The ability of State Department NGOs to hire rentamobs to demand that the government does what it wants to do is collapsing, as Trump reduces their NGO funding.  He has not reduced by much, but even a small reduction has a large effect, because most of the money winds up being stolen by high placed leftists, rather than used to hire the river of meat.  The mobs are financed by what is left over, and a small reduction in the total means a large reduction in what is available to hire mobs.
Consider, for example, the mighty mob that protested the Keystone pipeline under Obama.
Remember all those mighty and entirely spontaneous protests demanding that the Obama regime do what it quite obviously wanted to do and was quite obviously looking for justifications for doing, protests demanding that the government block every form of energy production in every white country, which obstructions have made the US into an energy importer for sixty years or so.
And, of course, with deep reluctance the Obama regime would invariably yield to the justified and entirely spontaneous and genuine rage of the mighty masses. Overnight (well, over the first one hundred and fifty days of the Trump regime), the US became an energy exporter. Trump would repeal a regulation by executive order, and the next day coal miners would be digging coal, repeal another regulation, and the next day drillers would be pumping oil. One day he makes an executive order, the next day Americans in flyover country are back to work. The next day after that he makes another executive order, and the day after that, more Americans in flyover country are back to work.
You did not hear of this.
Probably because the mighty and justifiable enraged masses strangely failed to spontaneously show up to spontaneously demonstrate their might and spontaneous justified rage. They were always demanding that Obama shut down energy, but somehow, when Trump turns the energy policy of every previous Democratic and cuckservative president for the last sixty years arse over tit, no protests happen.
Funny thing that.
By increasing jobs in flyover country, and decreasing jobs in the big urban centers (his current tax bill soaks the big Democratic Party cities) Trump ensures that white males move to places where their votes are likely to make a difference, while the people living on crime and welfare are in big cities, which will vote democrat by ten to one, instead of five to one, so that though Democrats continue to import people to live on crime and welfare and voting Democrat, they don't actually effect the election outcome all that much, being wasted in voting districts that are already overwhelmingly Democratic.
Obama attempted to dump Islamic terrorists imported from Somalia on marginal electorates in flyover country, with some success, but they tended to up stakes and head for the bright lights of the big city, a far from marginal electorate.

If you don't genuinely want the temple back, then modern Judaism is a religion of exile and not a religion of Israel.  The Maccabees wanted the temple back.  Do you think Jonathan Maccabee would be wailing at the western wall?
Israel was founded by secular socialist Jews, because religious Jews were frightened of getting the temple back, and still are frightened of getting the temple back.
If you get the temple back, sixteen hundred years of excuses and rationalizations for phariseeism vanish, and the pharisees are back to being the guys who lost the war and caused the exile, while the Kohens are the guys who won the war with the Greeks.

There is in fact a negative relationship between political contributions and above market profits.
This suggests that when politicians want some contributions, they threaten to harm a business, and then get paid to leave them alone.
Thus, for example, the upsurge in political correctness, political censorship, and massive political contributions by silicon valley corporations reflects the end of the Silicon Valley exemption.  Silicon valley used to be able to get away with meritocracy, unlike the rest of America, but now the eye of Sauron has fallen upon it.  We would expect this to decrease, rather than increase, the profitability of Silicon Valley, and that indeed is what has happened.
A pretty good example of big corporations doing evil was Transpacific a system of economic regulation by the “International Community”.  Free Trade for corporations big enough to own a skyscraper in a major city and fill it full of lawyers. Lesser businesses would find themselves criminals because of a thousand pages of regulation that no one reads and no one understands, least of all those enforcing it.
The practical consequence of the Transpacific Partnership would have been regulation by far away bureaucrats rather than near at hand bureaucrats.  Now arguably this would benefit corporations who are big enough to afford skyscrapers full of lawyers at the expense of smaller corporations, but it is mighty obvious that the chief beneficiaries would have been "the international community", rather than evil giant

The caja subset of javascript has no access to the dom, and runs in a sandbox.  So it can only screw things that you put into the sandbox.

You asserted that I was alone and unloved, something that people of my sex and my political leanings seldom experience, and people of your sex and your political leanings regularly experience, in part because our ideology tells us that "love your neighbor" means your actual neighbor, not hostile angry people in Africa, and that our duty to close kin is greater than our duty to friends, and our duty to friends exceeds our duty to far away strangers.

And those few of us males that suffer from it are seldom much troubled. Women need to be loved much more than men, and women, having a much shorter period of sexual attractiveness and fertility than men, frequently blow their one short chance.  Men are troubled by not getting their dicks wet, by lack of sex, not by lack of love. But if they neglect to use a condom, likely to wind up getting stuck with being loved.
For a man, love is in plentiful, indeed excessive, supply, particularly if he hates condoms, just as sex is in plentiful supply for women.  If a man who feels he needs love, he has plenty of time in which to find it, whereas a woman has only a short time in which to find it, and is apt to waste her time partying, getting an education, and building a career during that terribly brief period when she should be building a family.
Because of the social environment of social justice warriors, and because of the sexual misconduct valorized by social justice warriors, female social justice warriors regularly and routinely blow their one short chance by sleeping with men who do not call them back, and by cuckolding any man so foolish as to call them back, until they stop getting nine at night booty calls from Jeremy Meeks.

And if God did not ordain them, Darwin tells us that Gnon did.  And chances are that the will of Gnon was demonstrated where farming started, when someone first tried empire.  Irrespective of whether Babel actually existed or what happened there, farming would have led to the first city, the first city likely became the first Kingdom, the first Kingdom likely became the first empire, and then the proverbial would have hit the fan.

Let us recollect the Khmer Rouge.
Before 1973 the Khmer Rouge were brutal totalitarian terrorists who infamous for sometimes practicing one way portage.
You need to transport supplies from A to B, so you round up some peasants at A and have them carry your stuff to B.  You don't feed them, but you tell them there will be food and water at B.  When you arrive at B, you kill them.
And of course, most tenured academics in the western world thought they were great guys, and if any tenured academic doubted it, he remained silent.  If there was a single tenured academic in the entire western world who doubted their goodness and greatness, he remained silent.
After 1973, the Khmer Rouge were brutal totalitarian terrorists who engaged in red terror, endlessly searching for imaginary capitalists, kulaks, capitalist roaders, elitists, and CIA agents.
And of course, most tenured academics in the western world thought they were great guys, and if any tenured academic doubted it, he remained silent.  If there was a single tenured academic in the entire western world who doubted their goodness and greatness, he remained silent.
Around 1978 or so, the Khmer Rouge went far out rabid space bat crazy, torturing to death everyone who fell short of the immeasurable goodness and greatness of the Khmer Rouge, including, indeed especially, their fellow Khmer Rouge.
And of course, most tenured academics in the western world thought they were great guys, and if any tenured academic doubted it, he remained silent.  If there was a single tenured academic in the entire western world who doubted their goodness and greatness, he remained silent.
Towards the end of 1978 the Khmer Rouge were running seriously short of Khmer Rouge, and those few who remained were generally under sentence of death by torture.
And of course, most tenured academics in the western world thought they were great guys, and if any tenured academic doubted it, he remained silent.  If there was a single tenured academic in the entire western world who doubted their goodness and greatness, he remained silent.
Towards the end of December 1978, or early in January 1979, the Khmer Rouge, those of them still alive, lost power.   And then every academic everywhere felt free to criticize the Khmer Rouge.
Which they did by claiming that the Khmer Rouge had been installed in power by Ronald Reagan and the CIA.

g2s is trying to manufacture tribalism on the basis of covetousness, envy, and theft.
Libertarianism is a response to this effort
The left wing effort to turn econonomic categories into tribes was never terribly successful, and now the left is more focused on trying to generate tribalism on the basis of sexual identity and race, generate tribalism on the basis of actually existent tribes.
Which is a lot more successful.
Also a lot more likely to lead to genocide.
Libertarianism is paralyzed by this turn, which renders libertarianism Instead of stealing the bakery, or price controlling baker's inputs and outputs, they demand the baker cheer at a gay wedding.
Which, on the face of it, does not directly lead to mass murder the way stealing, covetousness, and envy does.
But fighting over status is just as likely, indeed more likely to turn deadly as fighting over stuff.
It has become apparent that there is no stopping point.  Males are just naturally superior to women in the male sphere, and white males are just naturally superior to nonwhites in most spheres.
This results in endless, and endlessly escalating efforts, to crush this natural superiority.  And this endless escalation has no stopping point but genocide.
OK, white men cannot jump and cannot dance, and our running is seriously underwhelming, but in most spheres, obviously superior.  In particular and especially, white males are superior soldiers to any other race by far. Notice the hilarious underperformance of the black posterboys of both sides in the civil war.  Similarly, notice that any military that incorporates females as soldiers never wins a war against a military that does not, irrespective of the races.  You might argue that the Vietnam war was a counter example to this, but that was a proxy war between the blue empire and the red empire, whites fighting over browns, rather than with browns.
Today's chinese art is obviously superior to today's white art, but this reflects our current decadence.  China is coming out of a dark age, while we are sliding into a dark age.   Some blame the Jews for the current undeniably crappy state of white art.  But the Chinese always had good art, even in their dark age.    We have done better in the past than now, but OK, whites are not obviously better than East Asians at art, and it is plausible that East Asians are better at art than whites.
Whites, on the other hand, are better at technological creativity than anyone, even East Asians (though the Japanese are pretty good), and, closely related to this, better at war.  The current technological superiority of East Asia is substantially dependent on white and Eurasian emigres, among them emigres fleeing the tribal violence and political repression in California and Silicon Valley.
The current white inferiority at war is the result of women in the military.   If we return to the early nineteenth century style army, where logistics are classified as camp followers rather than soldiers, and part of the duty of camp followers is getting soldier's dicks wet, where the soldiers are all male and the camp followers disproportionately female, we will return to winning.

Observe that they are mostly brown, or female, or brown and female.  And I bet the rare light skinned males are Jews or light skinned hispanics.
If you are white and not Jewish, and you have a have a son at school, he is going to be discouraged and punished for showing ability, and for being male.
If you complain that that this is racist, if you complain when a pack of blacks who are biologically adults, even though the same chronological age as your son, beat him up, you will be called a racist, no matter how piously you condemn me.
"Racist" is just a hate word for "white".  When you call me a racist, it is no different from you calling a black man a nigger, or a Jew a kike. It is just an angry hateful word for people of a particular ethnic group.  Observe that no one called Trayvon Martin a racist even though the he indicated to his girlfriend that the fact that Zimmerman was light skinned was a major reason Martin decided to attack Zimmerman.
Because Martin Trayvon was not racist.
When a gang of blacks beat up a white man because he is white, that is not racism, that is anti racism.  Everyone instinctively calls it anti racism.  Because that is what it is.
No one is going to spontaneously call Martin Trayvon "racist" because he was in the habit of physically attacking people for being lighter skinned than himself, any more than they are going to call me "gay" for being light hearted and happy.

In context, Juan is probably referring to the claim that the Khmer Rouge murdered one hell of a lot Cambodians, and especially murdered the Khmer Rouge themselves.
The new government (nominally communist) did a house to house survey, asking people about disappearances.  Found about three million missing.
Which is consistent with what individual Cambodians I have met tell me, were telling people well before 1978 December.
Defenders of the Khmer Rouge regime claimed that was just commies defaming other commies.
The new government proceeded to dig up the killing fields.  Found a bit over two million people dumped in mass graves.
So, not entirely made up.
Supporters of terror, torture, and mass murder, will condemn such numbers, but will never propose any substantially lower alternate numbers.

Fascist governments most certainly do not advocate killing their own citizenry, but are apt to define "citizen" in an alarmingly narrow fashion. From her name, I would suspect that Marina might not necessarily be defined as a citizen were a fascist government take power in America.
Left wing governments generally advocate killing class enemies, or royalists, or aristocrats, and this time around will probably advocate killing "racists" and "sexists"
At the time that they start killing people belonging to this category, no one remains who believes that they belong to this category, but pretty soon, very large numbers of people belonging to this category are And soon after that, even larger numbers of such wicked people.
And not long after that, even more.
Right wing dictatorships generally forbid interest in politics.  As Charles the first told us, politics is the King's business and no one elses.  Thus right wing political killings are necessarily self limiting.  If you start killing large numbers of people for taking excessive interest in politics, people lose interest in politics.
Left wing dictatorships generally insist on interest in politics.  The personal is political.  Which rapidly becomes terrifying, and soon after that, increasingly terrifying.  Thus left wing political repression, unlike right wing political repression, is not self limiting.
Reflect on the infamous "Dear Colleague" letter from the Obama administration, recently rescinded by the Trump administration.
The practical effect of the letter is that if a third party deems some woman has been raped the evil rapists life must be very publicly destroyed without bothering with any inconveniences like charges, investigation, or evidence.
The circumstances leading to this letter was that we established the principle that women always tell the truth about rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment.
Well, actually we established the principle that women always lie when they deny rape, sexual assault, and sexual harassment, but if a woman arguably changes her story during a struggle session after three big fat hairy lesbians have been screaming in her face for two hours straight, *then* she is telling the truth.
Hence the significance of the reference to "third parties" in the Dear Colleague letter. Note that the accused cannot cross examine the complainant, or even learn who the complainant is.
Recollect that when Crystal Mangum was detained by police for drunken violence after a night of industrious whoring, she gave numerous different stories, only one of which accused the Duke University sports team of rape, but the authorities insisted on going with the story that accused the sports team.  She could easily have been steered towards a less dramatic story, or steered to claiming flying saucer abduction, or best of all, steered to confessing to drunken violence after a night of industrious whoring.  But hey, if sexual violence is on the table, women are always the victims, and men always the aggressors, even if it needs two cops to restrain the "victim".
So if police catch a drunk woman in a criminal act, she just has to say "sexual assault, domestic abuse, domestic violence", and she is golden. Just as restraining illegal immigrants who murder white people for racial reasons might deter illegal immigrants from exercising their rights, restraining drunken violent women from criminal acts might deter them from complaining about sexual harassment and sexual violence.  And we cannot have that, can we?
We also saw this principle in operation in the safe space conflict.  If someone said something that might make a member of the umpteenth gender uncomfortable, no actual complainant of the umpteenth gender need to be produced, nor any evidence that a single member of the umpteenth gender exists anywhere near the incident. And what with "microaggression" the possibility of making someone of an ever increasing number of ever smaller categories uncomfortable expands without limit.

The "Nazi kid" was driving a car that came under attack by antifa thugs. The windows were smashed in.  Trying to get away, he crashed at high speed into another car, which was pushed into another car, which was pushed into a several people, among them the fat woman, who was injured, along with several other people. Her injuries were not particularly serious, but she had a heart attack as a result of this incident.
"The Nazi kid" did not intentionally kill anyone.  There is no persuasive evidence he intended to harm anyone.  At most he recklessly caused collateral damage during his efforts to get away from antifa.
If he had been trying to harm people, it would have been _his_ car that hit her.

If you talk to any Cambodian, (a lot of donut shops seem to be operated by Cambodians) you will learn that several members of his family were murdered regardless of their real or imagined politics.
Which indicates total killings of several millions, approximately consistent with the new government's house to house survey and their exhumation of the killing fields.  The testimony of any one Cambodian proves that the new government's estimates are plausible, are in the right ballpark.
If you visit the Khmer Rouge killing fields, you will be shown evidence that guards who could read numbers were replaced by innumerate guards, indicating that the former guards were killed by the same apparatus of mass murder that they themselves operated, consistent with reports that towards the end of 1978, few Khmer Rouge remained, as a result of Khmer Rouge torturing other Khmer Rouge to death.
And if you yourself did not intend to torture tens of millions of Americans to death, you would have no inclination to deny the obvious and undeniable truth about the Khmer Rouge - and every radical left regime starting with the French Revolution.
Leftists hate everyone, and they hate those nearest to themselves more, and they hate themselves the most.  This is obvious every time they open their mouths, and proven by the historical record.

That the thieves on wall street are predominantly Jewish, most notoriously Bernie Madoff, former Chairman of the NASDAQ stock market, is well known.
And of the thieves on wall street that are not Jewish, the remainder are for the most part middle easterners or South Asians.
Though I suspect that you classify *everyone* on wall street as a thief, in which case you will come to a different conclusion.  If you classify them all as thieves, Jews are still disproportionately over represented, but not by nearly as much.
Also, the second most notorious thief on Wall Street is Jon Corzine, who is undeniably white anglo saxon protestant, so Jews are not in themselves the problem.
If we had adequate enforcement, Jews would cut out their predatory misconduct.  The problem is not Jews, it is inadequate enforcement.  But just as if you allow people to commit burglary, you will find that most of your burglars look remarkably like Trayvon Martin, if you allow people to defraud investors, you will find that most of your fraudsters look remarkably like Bernie Madoff.
Similarly trading in "Binary Options".  That scam is as Jewish as a Bar Mitzvah.  Maybe other scams are not so one sidely Jewish - obviously Jon Corzine's operation in European debt were not especially Jewish, and the great Mortgage meltdown was primarily "white hispanic" rather than Jewish.

"Hispanic" means that Angelo Mozilo got charge of a bank by affirmative action, and got other banks handed to his control by affirmative action.
Initially a white anglo guy had the real control, and Angelo Mozillo was just there for the bank to get favorable treatment by the regulators, the token minority with the big desk in the big office, but no meaningful stuff in his in tray, but then his sponsor retired, Angelo Mozilo got real charge of the bank, and totally screwed everything up.
And then he got real charge of a bunch of other banks, thanks to escalating favorable treatment by the regulators.
And then proceeded to run his bank, and the entire banking system, into the ground in the great Minority Mortgage Meltdown.  Subsequently he faced a bunch of criminal charges for numerous fraudulent activities, bribery, and corruption.  Hard to say if he was actually criminal and fraudulent, or just too hopelessly incompetent to do banking regulatory paperwork correctly and keep proper track of bank assets. (Which assets tended to disappear into his pockets and the pockets of the regulators, which tendency definitely hints at crime, fraud, and corruption, or at least a curious level of forgetfulness on his part and the part of the regulators.   Search for "Friends of Angelo" to get more details.)
You would be wrong:  CEO Citigroup who fucked up during the great mortgage minority meltdown and stole everything not nailed down, was Vikram Shankar Pandit, South Asian.
South Asians are massively over-represented when financial crime goes down, even more overrepresented than Jews.  Not that there are not plenty of Jews at Citigroup, but it seems that at Citigroup, the great Minority Mortgage Meltdown was a South Asian caper, not a Jewish caper.
Morgan Chase has a Jewish CRO, who is notoriously hostile to hasidic Jews, and notoriously ethnic nepotist towards reform Jews, but does not seem to be associated with anything obviously dishonest.  In particular, did not get his hands all that dirty during the great Minority Mortgage Meltdown, unlike his co-religionist, Jordan R. Belfort, also known as "the wolf of wall street"

But, if you are in a street with hundred black men and no cop in sight, you will be mugged.  If you are in a street with a hundred white men, you don't need a cop, you will not be mugged.

It follows there are five thousand African Americans smarter than me, fifty three thousand whites smarter than me.
But this is irrelevant, since you are committing Lewontin's Fallacy
Blacks differ from whites in many respects, not just IQ.  These differences make them inherently a separate tribe.  If they differed only in IQ, they could likely be assimilated, but they do not, one other big difference, one of many, being the propensity to criminal behavior.
Two tribes cannot coexist in the same territory.  One must rule, one must be ruled.  When we get ruled by blacks, cities burn.
Recall Obama saying "You did not build that"
Though, of course, we did build that.  Industrial civilization is the gift of whites to the world, along with the rule of law, and all that.
Now recall Juan saying what Obama said, but spelling out the implications: "a casual look at 'race' and crime shows that whites got the world record on crime."
Our crime being that we have a disproportionate share of the nice stuff, therefore, since we "did not build that", must have stolen it.
The remedy for this terrible theft being mass murder, since Juan in the same paragraph denies the crimes of the Pol Pot regime.
By the way, what race are you?  If Trayvon Martin caught you alone would he attack you on the basis of your race?
Would Obama hold the police back while a mob of blacks burned down your home and business as he did in Ferguson, because 'You did not build that".

The reason the banks needed to be bailed out was affirmative action lending, that they were pressured to lend money to illegal immigrants with no income, no job, and no assets to buy million dollar houses in the Bay Area.
It is not exactly that they were forced to do it, though the Bank of Beverly Hills was destroyed because the regulators sensed insufficient enthusiasm for the program, which seems very close to forcing them to do it, rather it was politically correct to do it, and politically correct bankers, most infamously Angelo Mozilo, were empowered by the regulators to take over less politically correct bankers.

In a few cases, we unloaded them on white people, but still white people who were single white females, usually recent immigrants with  no income, no job, no assets, and no credit rating.

Buying something and selling it is not theft, nor is it a scam if the thing is as it is represented to be.
The thieving scammers were those who purchased houses with no intention or ability to repay the mortgage - people who purchased houses with no assets.  And you cannot purchase a house with no assets, unless you are a beneficiary of affirmative action.
Thus precisely zero white males or married white women were thieving scammers in housing boom.
The financial crisis was the result of dud mortgages.
The dud mortgages, all of them, were affirmative action mortgages.  What drove the housing boom is that *if* *you* *were* *a* *beneficiary* *of* *affirmative* *action* *then* you could buy an expensive house despite being stone broke.
The housing boom was the result of affirmative action mortgages.
White males were involved in this process only as flipping houses with the intent of unloading the houses on affirmative action purchasers.
A white male would buy a house with the intention and capability of paying the mortgage if things went bad, but with the expectation that he could unload on an affirmative action borrower before things went bad.
And for the most part, that is exactly what we did.
And the reason we chose to do this is that we know that white males are forced to honor contracts, while affirmative action beneficiaries can walk away with no problems.
So we, unlike the end purchasers, told the truth and honored all agreements.
The housing boom was the result of affirmative action loans.  The financial crisis was the result dud mortgages.  The dud mortgages, all of them, were affirmative action loans.

Not what I see.
The ability of State Department NGOs to hire rentamobs to demand that the government does what it wants to do is collapsing, as Trump reduces their NGO funding.  He has not reduced by much, but even a small reduction has a large effect, because most of the money winds up being stolen by high placed leftists, rather than used to hire the river of meat.  The mobs are financed by what is left over, and a small reduction in the total means a large reduction in what is available to hire mobs.
Consider, for example, the mighty mob that protested the Keystone pipeline under Obama.
Remember all those mighty and entirely spontaneous protests demanding that the Obama regime do what it quite obviously wanted to do and was quite obviously looking for justifications for doing, protests demanding that the government block every form of energy production in every white country, which obstructions have made the US into an energy importer for sixty years or so.
And, of course, with deep reluctance the Obama regime would invariably yield to the justified and entirely spontaneous and genuine rage of the mighty masses. Overnight (well, over the first one hundred and fifty days of the Trump regime), the US became an energy exporter. Trump would repeal a regulation by executive order, and the next day coal miners would be digging coal, repeal another regulation, and the next day drillers would be pumping oil. One day he makes an executive order, the next day Americans in flyover country are back to work. The next day after that he makes another executive order, and the day after that, more Americans in flyover country are back to work.
You did not hear of this.
Probably because the mighty and justifiable enraged masses strangely failed to spontaneously show up to spontaneously demonstrate their might and spontaneous justified rage. They were always demanding that Obama shut down energy, but somehow, when Trump turns the energy policy of every previous Democratic and cuckservative president for the last sixty years arse over tit, no protests happen.
Funny thing that.
By increasing jobs in flyover country, and decreasing jobs in the big urban centers (his current tax bill soaks the big Democratic Party cities) Trump ensures that white males move to places where their votes are likely to make a difference, while the people living on crime and welfare are in big cities, which will vote democrat by ten to one, instead of five to one, so that though Democrats continue to import people to live on crime and welfare and voting Democrat, they don't actually effect the election outcome all that much, being wasted in voting districts that are already overwhelmingly Democratic.
Obama attempted to dump Islamic terrorists imported from Somalia on marginal electorates in flyover country, with some success, but they tended to up stakes and head for the bright lights of the big city, a far from marginal electorate.

Judaism is an obnoxious religion (though genuine Jewish believers are massively under represented among criminals, even in the crime of white collar fraud) because its exilic nature makes it hostile and angry.  The religion has a permanent chip on its shoulder.  Jews have returned. Judaism needs to return.
Religious Jews are still pissed about the temple, which theoreticaly they want back.  Actually they do not want it back because of the theological implications.  They could easily take it back, but would rather have something to be permanently pissed about.

No temple, don't actually want the temple back, because of the disturbing theological implications of actually having the temple, because actually having the temple immediately re-activates a pile of ancient Jewish law that today's pharisees do not want to touch with a ten foot pole.
If you don't genuinely want the temple back, then modern Judaism is a religion of exile and not a religion of Israel.  The Maccabees wanted the temple back.  Do you think Jonathan Maccabee would be wailing at the western wall?
Israel was founded by secular socialist Jews, because religious Jews were frightened of getting the temple back, and still are frightened of getting the temple back.
If you get the temple back, sixteen hundred years of excuses and rationalizations for phariseeism vanish, and the pharisees are back to being the guys who lost the war and caused the exile, while the Kohens are the guys who won the war with the Greeks.  The Kohens defeated a mighty formidable enemy, which victory looked astonishingly like a divine miracle, so the Pharisees thought that they would Jew God by provoking an even bigger war with an even more formidable enemy.

When Jews demanded that they be allowed to join the golf club, was that not coveting?

Trump is a political genius who is subcommunicating and dog whistling things to his voters that need to be said, and that no one dares say:
In this case, he is telling the voters that when the government shuts down, the Democrats are shutting it down because they want to bring in voters who will vote for turning America into a shithole.

Trump is a political genius, and the latest "shithole" drama proves it.
Every time PBS says "shithole, shithole, shithole, shithole, shithole, shithole, shithole, shithole, shithole, shithole, shithole, shithole, shithole, shithole" every American hears that if the shutdown happens, it is because the Democrats want to import voters who will vote for America becoming a shithole.

There is in fact a negative relationship between political contributions and above market profits.
This suggests that when politicians want some contributions, they threaten to harm a business, and then get paid to leave them alone.
Thus, for example, the upsurge in political correctness, political censorship, and massive political contributions by silicon valley corporations reflects the end of the Silicon Valley exemption.  Silicon valley used to be able to get away with meritocracy, unlike the rest of America, but now the eye of Sauron has fallen upon it.  We would expect this to decrease, rather than increase, the profitability of Silicon Valley, and that indeed is what has happened.
A pretty good example of big corporations doing evil was Transpacific a system of economic regulation by the “International Community”.  Free Trade for corporations big enough to own a skyscraper in a major city and fill it full of lawyers. Lesser businesses would find themselves criminals because of a thousand pages of regulation that no one reads and no one understands, least of all those enforcing it.
The practical consequence of the Transpacific Partnership would have been regulation by far away bureaucrats rather than near at hand bureaucrats.  Now arguably this would benefit corporations who are big enough to afford skyscrapers full of lawyers at the expense of smaller corporations, but it is mighty obvious that the chief beneficiaries would have been "the international community", rather than evil giant

The caja subset of javascript has no access to the dom, and runs in a sandbox.  So it can only screw things that you put into the sandbox.

The left passionately denied the bloodbath in Cambodia as they passionately denied the bloodbath in Vietnam:
They only admitted to the bloodbath when Vietnam successfully invaded Cambodia - and only then did they blame it somehow on the Americans.
Back then when Chomsky and Herman wrote, the left, myself among them, all knew that something terrible was happening in Vietnam, though most now claim to remember otherwise. Today even Chomsky himself now remembers that no one in the press even suggested such a thing [12], though back then two months before he and Herman so indignantly complained of the failure to report the bloodbath as “missing”. the National Review told us [13]:
"THE BLOODBATH is motivated not so much by hatred or revenge as by the necessity for the Communist system to purge itself of undesirable elements From a Marxist viewpoint political purge is a necessity in order to achieve political purity, a precondition to the building of socialism. Political purity ensures single mindedness, which in turn achieves high efficiency. The Vietnamese Communists, as they showed in their conduct of the war, are doctrinaire single minded, efficient. But not until all Vietnamese men, women, and children think the Communist way will political purity be achieved for the new nation as a whole. This is why indoctrination (“re-education” as they call it) is of prime importance. For those who are too old or too stubborn to change elimination is the only alternative."
The crimes committed by the North Vietnamese regime against the Vietnamese people were smaller than the crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge against the Cambodians, but for us on the left they were emotionally far more significant.
When these Vietnamese crimes became known, the reaction of the left was ignore the facts, the details and evidence of the accusations, and attack the messenger, a reaction that was strikingly inconsistent with our self image as the conscience of the world, our image of ourselves as people who cared deeply about the welfare of faraway strangers. Today, most of the radical left comfortably remember these accusations that they so venomously and savagely condemned as never having been made.

Corvee was typically one day a week working on the fields or some such. Which is a lot less than I spend working for the government.  The ancient regime did not and could not send a generation off to Russia to die.
There was the important difference that though John Law could inflate away the paper money in your pocket, he did not and could not try to force bakers to supply bread for worthless money, unlike Venezuela today and unlike Revolutionary France.
But that is because they, and you, lie.
Progressives have destroyed science, and socialists' attempts at industrialization were second rate (reflect on soviet cars), relied on buying or stealing technology developed by capitalists (soviet cars and car factories were copied from the US under American engineers) and came at horrifying human cost.

And not just legalistic technicalities, which is what they have been nailing people associated with Trump for - for example the man who failed to reveal on his loan application that the rental was not arms length.  Rather, hideous and disgusting stuff, and "lying to the FBI", which always means merely that the FBI asked you the same question in a dozen different ways, and once you gave a different sounding question a different sounding answer.

The violence of leftists is continually and rapidly escalating.  War The only question is:  Do they wipe themselves out after killing a few million or so, as in Khmer Rouge Cambodia and Szechuan province, or does someone seize absolute power like Stalin, Sulla, or Cromwell, and put a stop to it.
Sulla was a rightist, Cromwell a moderate and reasonable leftist, Stalin a relatively sane radical leftist, but they all did a job that had to be done, and which was not done in Cambodia.

The supposed mechanism by which the Pentagon empowered the Khmer Rouge was by bombing the hell out of them, which story does not make any sense at all, and in any case the bombing stopped two years before they took power, so looks like it was effective in stopping them for as long as it And the predicted bloodbath in Vietnam did in fact take place as expected and predicted, and all you guys loved it at the same time as you denied.

The left passionately denied the bloodbath in Cambodia as they passionately denied the bloodbath in Vietnam:
They only admitted to the bloodbath when Vietnam successfully invaded Cambodia - and only then did they blame it somehow on the Americans.
Back then when Chomsky and Herman wrote, the left, myself among them, all knew that something terrible was happening in Vietnam, though most now claim to remember otherwise. Today even Chomsky himself now remembers that no one in the press even suggested such a thing [12], though back then two months before he and Herman so indignantly complained of the failure to report the bloodbath as “missing”. the National Review told us [13]:
"THE BLOODBATH is motivated not so much by hatred or revenge as by the necessity for the Communist system to purge itself of undesirable elements From a Marxist viewpoint political purge is a necessity in order to achieve political purity, a precondition to the building of socialism. Political purity ensures single mindedness, which in turn achieves high efficiency. The Vietnamese Communists, as they showed in their conduct of the war, are doctrinaire single minded, efficient. But not until all Vietnamese men, women, and children think the Communist way will political purity be achieved for the new nation as a whole. This is why indoctrination (“re-education” as they call it) is of prime importance. For those who are too old or too stubborn to change elimination is the only alternative."
The crimes committed by the North Vietnamese regime against the Vietnamese people were smaller than the crimes committed by the Khmer Rouge against the Cambodians, but for us on the left they were emotionally far more significant.
When these Vietnamese crimes became known, the reaction of the left was ignore the facts, the details and evidence of the accusations, and attack the messenger, a reaction that was strikingly inconsistent with our self image as the conscience of the world, our image of ourselves as people who cared deeply about the welfare of faraway strangers. Today, most of the radical left comfortably remember these accusations that they so venomously and savagely condemned as never having been made.

Within my lifetime there have been two enormous mass murders committed by the left overseas, and each of them was simultaneously supported and denied by the American left.
I ceased to be a leftist when I saw the flood of refugees fleeing the bloodbath in Vietnam and fleeing the Khmer Rouge autogenocide, not so much because these enormous crimes horrified me, but because the reaction of my fellow leftists to these gigantic crimes horrified me.
And, since that is how they reacted to the liquidation of the kulaks, the great leap forward, the Vietnamese bloodbath, and the Cambodian autogenocide, that is likely what is coming for America.

And yet, while the kulaks were being liquidated, you guys sure thought it was communism.  You only ceased to think it was communism when they refrained from murdering as many people as you think should be murdered.
And here is Chomsky supporting and denying the Cambodian autogenocide while millions of refugees fled the terror:
Shortly before he denounced it with equal vigor - denounced it not because any new facts had become available, but because the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia now needed to justified.
That is exactly what you guys, for example Chomsky,  were saying about Khmer Rouge Cambodia, until suddenly you started saying the opposite about Cambodia, because it suddenly became convenient to do so.
You lie, you lie in support of mass murderers, because you intend to commit mass murder.
Millions of refugees fled Vietnam.  They said there was a bloodbath, and they were fleeing it, just as millions fled Cambodia, and said there was a genocide and they were fleeing it.

Video shows Flight 77 flying into the Pentagon at almost ground level, and small bits of Flight 77 and its passengers were sprayed all over the Pentagon.  Small spatters of the passengers' bones are still turning up in the Pentagon.

Each tower starts its fall by leaning sideways into the hole smashed by the plane, like a tree notched by the axe man.

Real molten iron is too bright to be viewed with the naked eye, so bright as to be very difficult to video.  If you look at videos of real molten iron pours, the intense light of molten iron overwhelms the camera, intensely illuminating everything around it, so that near the molten iron the light is too bright to register, looking like a Star Wars light saber, rather than a fluid or a flame, and away from the molten iron, full sunlight looks like darkness, as the camera or the camera operator turns its sensitivity down to minimum to avoid damage. Similarly, thermite.  If there was "nano thermite" or "thermate" involved in the fall of the towers, it would have been obvious.
I have seen real molten iron pours, and they look like most videos of molten iron pouring - blinding the eyes in the same way as they blind the cameras.  To video molten iron, you have to video it through welding goggles.  If you look at a Youtube video of molten iron taken in full sunlight by an ordinary camera without special measures, the sunlight turns to darkness as the camera attempts to accommodate the molten iron, and it still cannot accommodate the molten iron.
You knowingly lie about all these things, and proof that you know you are lying is that you do not link to the video evidence, you link to videos of talking heads telling lies about the video evidence.  If you genuinely thought that the videos show what you say they show, you would link to the videos themselves, rather than linking to videos of liars talking about what the videos supposedly show.  If there was thermite and such in the fall of the towers, we would not need talking heads to tell us what we were seeing.  Everyone would have seen it.
You are lying to cover the misconduct of Robert Mueller, and in defense of the Deep State / Democratic Party program of race replacement, in particular their program of moving vast numbers of black male Muslim military age rapist voters into marginal federal electorates.  They are not moving millions of Israeli voters into marginal federal electorates, and if they were, they would not be raping white women and children.

In the final image, the part of the line furthest from you, south end, has dropped as much as the penthouse, while the part of the line closest to you, north end, has dropped as much as the front of the building.
Measure it.
This shows that penthouse is not collapsing inside the building, the entire building is tilting away from you like a falling tree, tilting towards the holes blasted into the south side of the building by the planes piloted by the terrorists, like a tree falling over towards the notch cut by the axeman.
In any case, World Trade Tower was only designed to survive three hours of uncontrolled fire before the steel softened and the building fell. Because of the damage done by the planes, there was no water, with the result that the building experienced seven hours of uncontrolled fire, before falling.

The tilt is not minor.  It is the major part of the initial movement, possibly the entirety of the initial movement.
The penthouse does not collapse into the building.  Rather it goes out of sight because the building is tilting away from the camera to the south.
The image below, shot from the east side, shows it half way through its fall, transitioning from falling sideways like a tree, to collapsing downwards like a building.
After about two or three seconds into the collapse it starts to fall downwards, as if in a demolition, but the start of the collapse is that building seven tilts and rotates sideways like a tree falling towards the notch cut by the axeman.

The instructions to the bidders for the WTC 7 job were to bid on a 3 h rating for the columns and a 2 h rating for the metal deck and floor support steel, which corresponded to the more stringent fire resistance requirements for Type 1B (unsprinklered) construction.  These ratings were to be achieved by application of Monokote MK-5, a gypsum-based SFRM that contained a vermiculite aggregate.  According to the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) Fire Resistance Directory (1983), these ratings required a thickness of 22 mm (7/8 in.) of Monokote MK-5 to be applied to the heavy columns, 48 mm (1 7/8 in.) to be applied to the lighter columns, 13 mm (1/2 in.) to be applied to the beams, and 10 mm (3/8 in.) to be applied to the bottom of the metal deck.

Presumably he intended to dive into the pentagon from  above, as the other two planes dived into their target from above, missed, and pulled out of his dive at the last minute.
He went in the first floor, but his landing gear and one of his engines came out the second floor, suggesting that he had pulled out of his dive and was actually climbing when he hit.
Consistent with this, he also hit the Pentagon off center relative to his direction of approach.  He was flying North East, and hit the west side of the Pentagon, not the south west side of the Pentagon.

If it rated for three hours, this implies that the columns will cease to be protected after three hours.
That steel columns in tall buildings need a fire protection coating, need fire protection material implies, that if allowed to get too hot, the steel will soften, and the building will fall.
World Trade Center Building Seven fell in large part because fires raged uncontrolled for seven hours.  Steel frame buildings just are not designed to handle really prolonged fires.  This is a well known issue that people who build tall buildings talk about and design around all the time.

It takes time, work, and thought to rebut claims, no time at all to make up claims.
Lie.  World Trade Center Building Seven Fell slowly at first.  The penthouse fell first, then the entire outer frame of the building tilted to the south like a falling tree.  The penthouse wound up on the building's footprint, but the outer frame of the building wound up well south of the building's footprint.
The outer frame of the building did not go into free fall until after it had rotated a considerable distance south, like a tree leaning towards the notch cut by the axeman.
The fall eventually went into free fall downwards, but it started out by falling sideways like a tree
The details are complicated, but the basic story is simple:
Steel frame construction, massive damage on the South side, out of control fires raging for seven hours on steel columns only rated for three hours.  The interior of the building collapsed, and then shortly afterwards, the outer shell of the building fell sideways towards the South like a tree.
If you throw a rock at a glass window, it will shatter in a complicated way and if you want to explain the particular details of the shattering you wind up with a complicated explanation, but the basic story is simple:
Smash a big hole in a tall steel frame building, set it on fire. Deactivate the water sprinkers and send the fire fighters away to deal with more urgent matters, and eventually that building will fall.
The way that World Trade Center Bulding Seven fell is complicated, as a glass window hit with a brick shatters in a complicated way, but that it fell is no more mysterious than that a window hit with a brick shatters.

World Trade Center Building Seven fell after seven hours of uncontrolled fire, which is roughly what one would expect, and it fell largely sideways, not on its own footprint, which is roughly what one would expect in collapse by fire,  and it fell piece by piece, not all at the same time, with the outer shell collapsing after everything else, after the innards were gutted by internal collapses, which is roughly what one would expect in a building where the inner floors had a lower fire rating than the columns.
And when the outer shell finally collapsed, it started its fall by tilting sideways to the south like a tree notched by a woodman, which is what one would expect in a building that suffered massive damage on the south side, though the primary cause of the collapse was the fire, not the notch on the south side.

It is unusual for a building to be smashed up by the collapse of an adjacent building, and for there then to be no water with which to fight the fires and firemen facing considerably more urgent matters.
That World Trade Center Seven was designed to withstand at least three hours of fire implies that the designers expected the fires to be controlled in less than three hours.  And, of course, they were not.
But the fires, being unfought, then joined together in subsequent hours as one big fire.

The purpose of these lies is to deny the culpability of Robert Mueller, and to persuade us that importing millions of young male military age Muslims from Saharan Africa and dumping them on marginal federal electorates is not a problem.
Video shows Flight 77 flying into the Pentagon at almost ground level, and small bits of Flight 77 and its passengers were sprayed all over the Pentagon.  Small spatters of the passengers' bones are still turning up in the Pentagon.
Video shows the towers falling like trees, not like demolitions, particularly Trade Tower Seven.  Each tower starts its fall by leaning sideways into the hole smashed by the plane, like a tree notched by the axe man. Each tower starts by falling sideways like a tree notched by the axe man, and *then* goes into free fall.
The video showing burning fluid pouring out of the Trade Tower shows a stream of burning jet fuel carrying burning seat cushions and burning body parts.  The liquid pouring out is only flame hot and flame bright, not molten iron hot and molten iron bright.
Real molten iron is too bright to be viewed with the naked eye, so bright as to be very difficult to video.  If you look at videos of real molten iron pours, the intense light of molten iron overwhelms the camera, intensely illuminating everything around it, so that near the molten iron the light is too bright to register, looking like a Star Wars light saber, rather than a fluid or a flame, and away from the molten iron, full sunlight looks like darkness, as the camera or the camera operator turns its sensitivity down to minimum to avoid damage. Similarly, thermite.  If there was "nano thermite" or "thermate" involved in the fall of the towers, it would have been obvious.
I have seen real molten iron pours, and they look like most videos of molten iron pouring - blinding the eyes in the same way as they blind the cameras.  To video molten iron, you have to video it through welding goggles.  If you look at a Youtube video of molten iron taken in full sunlight by an ordinary camera without special measures, the sunlight turns to darkness as the camera attempts to accommodate the molten iron, and it still cannot accommodate the molten iron.
You knowingly lie about all these things, and proof that you know you are lying is that you do not link to the video evidence, you link to videos of talking heads telling lies about the video evidence.  If you genuinely thought that the videos show what you say they show, you would link to the videos themselves, rather than linking to videos of liars talking about what the videos supposedly show.  If there was thermite and such in the fall of the towers, we would not need talking heads to tell us what we were seeing.  Everyone would have seen it.
You are lying to cover the misconduct of Robert Mueller, and in defense of the Deep State / Democratic Party program of race replacement, in particular their program of moving vast numbers of black male Muslim military age rapist voters into marginal federal electorates.  They are not moving millions of Israeli voters into marginal federal electorates, and if they were, they would not be raping white women and children.

In the final image, the part of the line furthest from you, south end, has dropped as much as the penthouse, while the part of the line closest to you, north end, has dropped as much as the front of the building.
Measure it.
This shows that penthouse is not collapsing inside the building, the entire building is tilting away from you like a falling tree, tilting towards the holes blasted into the south side of the building by the planes piloted by the terrorists, like a tree falling over towards the notch cut by the axeman.
In any case, World Trade Tower was only designed to survive three hours of uncontrolled fire before the steel softened and the building fell. Because of the damage done by the planes, there was no water, with the result that the building experienced seven hours of uncontrolled fire, before falling.

The tilt is not minor.  It is the major part of the initial movement, possibly the entirety of the initial movement.
The penthouse does not collapse into the building.  Rather it goes out of sight because the building is tilting away from the camera to the south.
The image below, shot from the east side, shows it half way through its fall, transitioning from falling sideways like a tree, to collapsing downwards like a building.
After about two or three seconds into the collapse it starts to fall downwards, as if in a demolition, but the start of the collapse is that building seven tilts and rotates sideways like a tree falling towards the notch cut by the axeman.

The instructions to the bidders for the WTC 7 job were to bid on a 3 h rating for the columns and a 2 h rating for the metal deck and floor support steel, which corresponded to the more stringent fire resistance requirements for Type 1B (unsprinklered) construction.  These ratings were to be achieved by application of Monokote MK-5, a gypsum-based SFRM that contained a vermiculite aggregate.  According to the Underwriters Laboratories (UL) Fire Resistance Directory (1983), these ratings required a thickness of 22 mm (7/8 in.) of Monokote MK-5 to be applied to the heavy columns, 48 mm (1 7/8 in.) to be applied to the lighter columns, 13 mm (1/2 in.) to be applied to the beams, and 10 mm (3/8 in.) to be applied to the bottom of the metal deck.

Presumably he intended to dive into the pentagon from  above, as the other two planes dived into their target from above, missed, and pulled out of his dive at the last minute.
He went in the first floor, but his landing gear and one of his engines came out the second floor, suggesting that he had pulled out of his dive and was actually climbing when he hit.
Consistent with this, he also hit the Pentagon off center relative to his direction of approach.  He was flying North East, and hit the west side of the Pentagon, not the south west side of the Pentagon.

If it rated for three hours, this implies that the columns will cease to be protected after three hours.
That steel columns in tall buildings need a fire protection coating, need fire protection material implies, that if allowed to get too hot, the steel will soften, and the building will fall.
World Trade Center Building Seven fell in large part because fires raged uncontrolled for seven hours.  Steel frame buildings just are not designed to handle really prolonged fires.  This is a well known issue that people who build tall buildings talk about and design around all the time.

It takes time, work, and thought to rebut claims, no time at all to make up claims.
Lie.  World Trade Center Building Seven Fell slowly at first.  The penthouse fell first, then the entire outer frame of the building tilted to the south like a falling tree.  The penthouse wound up on the building's footprint, but the outer frame of the building wound up well south of the building's footprint.
The outer frame of the building did not go into free fall until after it had rotated a considerable distance south, like a tree leaning towards the notch cut by the axeman.
The fall eventually went into free fall downwards, but it started out by falling sideways like a tree
The details are complicated, but the basic story is simple:
Steel frame construction, massive damage on the South side, out of control fires raging for seven hours on steel columns only rated for three hours.  The interior of the building collapsed, and then shortly afterwards, the outer shell of the building fell sideways towards the South like a tree.
If you throw a rock at a glass window, it will shatter in a complicated way and if you want to explain the particular details of the shattering you wind up with a complicated explanation, but the basic story is simple:
Smash a big hole in a tall steel frame building, set it on fire. Deactivate the water sprinkers and send the fire fighters away to deal with more urgent matters, and eventually that building will fall.
The way that World Trade Center Bulding Seven fell is complicated, as a glass window hit with a brick shatters in a complicated way, but that it fell is no more mysterious than that a window hit with a brick shatters.

Myanmar recently did what was necessary, and China is now doing what is necessary in Xinjiang province.  No lesser means have every succeeded. Every civilization, every culture, every people, every race, every religion, has tried other means, and have been trying for over a thousand years.

World Trade Center Building Seven fell after seven hours of uncontrolled fire, which is roughly what one would expect, and it fell largely sideways, not on its own footprint, which is roughly what one would expect in collapse by fire,  and it fell piece by piece, not all at the same time, with the outer shell collapsing after everything else, after the innards were gutted by internal collapses, which is roughly what one would expect in a building where the inner floors had a lower fire rating than the columns.
And when the outer shell finally collapsed, it started its fall by tilting sideways to the south like a tree notched by a woodman, which is what one would expect in a building that suffered massive damage on the south side, though the primary cause of the collapse was the fire, not the notch on the south side.

It is unusual for a building to be smashed up by the collapse of an adjacent building, and for there then to be no water with which to fight the fires and firemen facing considerably more urgent matters.
That World Trade Center Seven was designed to withstand at least three hours of fire implies that the designers expected the fires to be controlled in less than three hours.  And, of course, they were not.
But the fires, being unfought, then joined together in subsequent hours as one big fire.

Attorney General William P. Barr issued the following statement:
morning from an apparent suicide while in federal custody. Mr. Epstein’s death raises serious questions that must be answered. In addition to the FBI’s investigation, I have consulted with the Inspector General who is opening an investigation into the circumstances of Mr. Epstein’s death."
It took two years for Trump to start the wall.  It will take a year and a half to clean up the FBI.
Cleaning up the FBI is a counter coup, an autocoup.  In a counter coup, you don't show your hand till you are in a position to nail the traitor's hides to the wall and survive doing so.
Black pilling on Trump bringing the jobs back was a mistake.  Black pilling on Syria turned out to be a mistake.  Black pilling on the wall turned out to be a mistake.  Black pilling on legal immigration and H-1B turned out to be a mistake.
Let's not black pill on cleaning up the FBI and draining the swamp.  We now have dueling investigations into the latest suicide of someone who knew too much about the Clintons.
Epstein knew too much about too many important and powerful people.
In particular he knew too much about the Clintons.
His continuing usefulness depended on him being pals with Trump, and thus potentially having the goods on Trump.  The mainstream media was salivating over the Trump connection.   So they put the heat on him to give them the goods on Trump.  And then it comes out that though he says he is pals with Trump, though he told his girls he was pals with Trump, they never saw Trump palling with him.
Hence not useful.  And, a few hours after this comes out, a few hours after it becomes known he is not useful, there is a convenient camera malfunction and he hangs himself in a room with nothing to hang himself Yet another tragic suicide by someone who knows stuff about the Clintons.
The connection with Israel is that Epstein was blackmailing a wealthy Jew who had connections with Israel. (That Jew claims that Epstein was embezzling from him, but strangely took no action to prosecute that supposed embezzlement) That is a mighty thin connection to Israel, but there is a mighty thick connection to the Clintons, to Mueller, and to the FBI.
And there is, of course, a long history of the FBI doing dirty work for the Clintons.
Whenever the FBI is caught up to no good, they are apt to blame Mossad and the Jews, as with Mueller's "Dancing Israelis", (though lately Mueller has been blaming Russian Trolls).
So when someone implies that Mossad abducted Epstein or murdered Epstein, I suspect that the person telling me this is an FBI shill, and that the FBI murdered Epstein to shut him up.

When Kathryn Steinle was shot in the back on the embarcadero, how did her killer know she believed she had privilege?
White people are second class citizens.
A white person does not dare be rude to a nonwhite, but it is just fine for nonwhites to be rude to whites.
Police are more likely to shoot whites in a confrontation, because they know they can get away with it.  There are a lot more confrontations between police and nonwhites, in part because nonwhites know they can get away with confronting police when whites cannot.
When non whites walk down the street, they take up more space on the pavement than whites, expecting whites to get out of the way.

Sarah Jeong issued, over many years, an enormous pile of tweets expressing hatred of white people, and among those tweets a few expressing intent to murder all white people.
Naturally she was appointed to the editorial board of the New York Times.
Needless to say this appointment has been stoutly defended by every goodthinking leftist, though I see some white male leftists showing symptoms of mental breakdown, their mask of sanity slipping.

In the past year, all of the following headlines have appeared, in well-read publications:
What is new is the direct indictment of white people as a race. This happened through a strange rhetorical transformation over the past few years. At first, “white men are our greatest threat” postings tended to be ironic, a way of putting the racist shoe on the other foot. They were meant to show that blaming an entire race for the harmful actions of a few individuals is senseless.
Then the tenor changed. What started as irony turned into an actual belief that white people, specifically white men, are more dangerous and immoral than any other people, and that systematic state discrimination against them is therefore moral, necessary, virtuous, and deserved.

Leftism is defection against near, and alliance with far in order to destroy near.
Thus white leftists ally with none whites in order to destroy their nearby white enemies in the pursuit of power.  Democrats import non whites to live on crime, welfare, and voting democrat, without thinking beyond the next election.  Hatred of white males is the KKKrazy glue that holds the Democratic Party coalition of the fringes together.  To seize despotic power and loot the country, you need an enemy, and the deplorables in flyover country have been nominated as the enemy, much as Trotsky nominated the more successful peasants.
Without that KKKrazy glue, the mestizo portion of the Democrat coalition would be shooting  the black portion of the Democrat coalition in the streets, and the Muslim portion of the Democrat coalition would be tossing the gay portion of the Democrat coalition from high buildings.
Thus, for example, the Populares, who wanted a more democratic Roman Empire, allied with the Samnites, who wanted to kill every Roman male and overthrow the walls of Rome.  And similarly the Democracy protestors in China ally with the USG state department (far), who want China to return to poverty and chaos.
Facebook is controlled by a Jew, and Jews notoriously fail to identify as white, and delusively imagine that the pets that they have affirmative actioned into positions of power will go along with Jews adopting white or nonwhite identity as convenient at any given moment, hence the Jewish enthusiasm for the Islamic conquest of Europe, even though it is obvious that they will be the next to be liquidated.
The Jew Trotsky, a failed urban money lender, told the peasants that he too was a peasant, and their real enemy was the kulak, that the enemy of the peasant with one cow was the peasant with two cows.  Meanwhile he told the Jews that he too was a Jew, and that together with him, they would murder the peasants - except that he soon noticed it was more lucrative to torture the Jew for hoarded gold coins, than to torture the peasant for buried seed corn, and the disproportionately Jewish Russian communists wound up murdering far more Jews than Hitler did.
Trotskyists, who are mostly Jewish, hate Jews more than Nazis do, just as white Democrats hate whites.

Democracy has been tried before.  It always self destructs much the way it is self destructing now, leading, after a longer or shorter period of chaos and ruin, to rule by Caesar.
One of the common modes of self destruction is that people vote their tribe, ethnicity, race, and religion, which eventually results in tribal warfare and the recreation of states with a common race and religion, which is the failure mode that we are entering into now.
The reactionary movement is people positioning themselves for the coming end of democracy.  We hope to survive it, we hope for our children to survive it, and our politics and plots are aimed at making the transition shorter, smoother, and less bloody.  We look at how people in the past have successfully dealt with the problems we are now encountering, and look at the past how people in the past have bloodily and catastrophically responded unwisely to the problems we are encountering now, to learn from past success and past failure.
Trump as holy American Emperor (King under God) would be the ideal solution, God Emperor Trump (cult of personality and all that) a more realistic and practical solution, but a long period of bloody chaos is more realistic and likely.  Trump is a deal maker, not a warrior, therefore not the best candidate for God Emperor.  But war approaches, and you go with the leader you have, not the leader you want.

When war comes, the brown democrats will see Jews as white Europeans, as you do, but this is going to come as a mighty big shock to a great many Many, probably most Jews, do not think of themselves as white Europeans.
And as we drift towards tribal war, one of the major failure modes of democracy, this matters a lot.  People are voting and organizing on race, ethnicity, tribe, and religion, not class.
The Holodomor, which murdered about ten million or so, was in substantial part caused by Jewish animus towards Christians.
Note also the historical tendency of Jews to back Muslims in the never ending war between Christians and Muslims, even though Jews have only ever prospered under Christian rule.
Similarly observe Jewish support for the Islamic conquest of Europe, even though it is absolutely obvious that Muslims are already beginning to expel Jews from Europe.  This echoes the similarly self destructive Jewish behavior during the crusades.  It always seems to come as shock to Jews when they ally with anti Christian factions, and the anti Christian factions do not ally back.  In the crusades, the Jews supported the Muslims, but the Muslims did not support the Jews, a story that the brown Democrats are now re-enacting.
And if, not what 'race' do you think they belong to?
What matters is not what race I think they belong to, but what race they think they belong to.
There is always a ruling class.  The problem is that our ruling class is losing internal cohesion, partly due to tribalization, and partly due to loss of moral character in our ruling class.
The purpose of political correctness is to humiliate and degrade by demanding that people accept an obvious lie, thus demonstrating who has the power and who shall submit.
Point deer, make horse. PC is the opposite of the old honor codes. Instead of an honor code, we have a dishonor code. Instead of compliance testing young potential elite members for courage, honor, and dignity, we compliance test them for cowardice, lying, and groveling.  And so we get a ruling elite that fails to hold together.
Right and left were defined in the FrenchRevolution.
Left is the party for knocking over the apple cart to grab some apples. They loudly announce that this will produce an abundance of apples, and for a short while it does.  Right is the party of order, as exemplified in the French Revolution.
When a mysterious apple shortage ensues, they launch a hunt for the witches casting the magic spells causing the mysterious shortage of apples, and a hunt for some more apple carts to knock over.  Thus most of the people murdered in the French Revolution were not aristocrats, but rather people accused of "hoarding", "profiteering", and ""price gouging".  Typically bakers and peasants.
This not only describes socialism, but also such innovations as the sexual revolution and the destruction of marriage.  They figured that men would get more sex, but most men are getting less sex.  Similarly, about fifty percent of men who transition to the female role suicide, and the rest are mostly working as whores.

Jews vote on their ethnicity, not on their economic class.  The problem is not that I am "racist", but that every voting block mobilized by the Democrats is "racist".
Persuade them of that.
Reactionaries don't believe in the Marxist class analysis, neither did Lysander Spooner, whom you claim to be an adherent of.
The reactionary class categorization is priests (including professors, the mainstream media, public intellectuals, lawyers, judges, etc) warriors (including officers, soldiers, police, rentacops, mercs, etc) merchants (capitalists, entrepeneurs, businessmen, and such) and the masses.
In which categorization I am primarily a merchant, trying out for the priesthood.  But I spend more time on merchant stuff.
 > And what are your political beliefs? The only reason I ask is
 > because the very first author that shows up on jim.com is
 > Lysander Spooner, but, YOU NEVER READ A WORD HE WROTE.
You interpret Lysander Spooner as a commie.  I interpret him otherwise.
I was an anarcho capitalist, but as tribalism grew, I realized that anarcho capitalism was incapable of defending itself against tribes and religions (defining religions broadly, as I have defined priests broadly, to include communism and progressivism)
Something like anarchocapitalism worked in saga period Iceland because it was a state enforced theocracy, and the official religion upheld the right of every man to himself avenge wrongs done to him - the official religion denied the state the monopoly of legitimate of violence.  The fragility of that system became apparent when Christianity hit them.
  I have therefore come to the conclusion that the best system is a long established and stable monarchy, as exemplified by the Emirate of Dubai, and such monarchies can only grow out of military dictatorship.  So I now favor military dictatorship, thinly disguised as the Republic, for America, as Augustus become military dictator of Rome, under a thin disguise of the Republic continuing.
Which is the usual outcome when democracy self destructs, as it is self destructing now.
The outcome I hope for is Holy American Emperor Trump, King under God, but a more likely and more readily achievable outcome is God Emperor Trump.
And a far more likely outcome than either of those is a long period of chaos and ruin.
One King three thousand miles is a lesser problem than a thousand kings three miles away. The loss of cohesion in the ruling elite leads to anarcho tyranny, not anarcho capitalism.  Yesterday I was trying to transfer a sum of money while avoiding tax impact, and one bank thought the legalities worked one way, and the other bank thought the legalities worked a different way, and they could not agree because the laws and regulations are complicated, intrusive, obscure, incomprehensible, there is no one who actually knows what that mean, except that no matter what you do, if they want to charge you with something, they will probably find something to charge you with.
What the french left supported in place of monarchy, feudalism, and theocracy was terror, mass murder, socialism, total war, and the enlightenment, the enlightenment being a state imposed religion immensely more destructive than Christianity.
 > So AGAIN, why does jim.com pretend to be libertarian when you are
 > a RIGHT WINGER, AND SO A MONARCHIST?
I want liberty.
If you want liberty, China is better than the US, but Dubai (Monarchy) and Thailand (Monarchy plus military dictatorship) a lot better than either the US or China.
The greatest period of liberty was England from 1660 to 1820, when Kings had real power.

The King of the emirate of Dubai, the land of which Dubai is the capital, quite obviously exercises real power, Dubai is largely his personal property, and Dubai is, for its citizens, and for the better sort of people among its non citizen majority, the most free country in the world (for other non citizens, not so free)
The King of Thailand exercises a lot of power, though less than the King of Dubai.  He has to accommodate the military, but the military have to accommodate him.  You are free to say bad things about the military, but the one substantial restriction on freedom in Thailand is that you are not free to say bad things about the King.

Subsaharan Africans in Africa, who never experienced slavery, behave worse than whites, (check the murder rates) and some kinds of Africans behave worse than others.
While subsaharan Africans are inherently worse behaved than whites, there is a marked difference  between those who came here as slaves, and those who came here under their own power.
When those blacks that sold their brethren to us migrate to the US under their own power, they and their children are far better behaved than the descendants of those that they sold, even though their children are raised in exactly the same environment.
The problem is obviously a genetic propensity to bad conduct, a propensity considerably worse among the those descended from those who got enslaved for hunting other people's cattle and gathering from other people's gardens.

If you look at the location of the defaults in 2009, they are all in hispanic, or black and hispanic areas.
Those guys did not have trillions to transfer to wall street scum.
Those loans were issued largely to stony broke hispanics by hispanics affirmative actioned into power over white people's money, the most infamous hispanic, the one who pissed away more white people's money than anyone else, was Angelo Mozillo.
What happened was that trillions of dollars were pissed away on minority loans, and then the banks received a trillion dollar bailout, and no one dared point to where the money was lost.

If you are anti feminazi, tell us about shit tests in the workplace.  I see a whole lot of disruptive shit testing in the workplace.  Companies go down the tubes in shit tests.  If you are anti feminazi, tell us about that.
True, but not the disturbing truth that is likely to get you into trouble.  True enough  that you might not be familiar with, or might not know or care about, the politically incorrect answer, but it is distinctly odd that you are unable to give politically incorrect answers to any of these questions.
You might genuinely forget the role of races in Darwin's big idea, lots of people genuinely do, but if you don't remember his big idea, it is because it gets you dangerously close to the role of races in his big idea and you don't even want to go near that.
Any person who is self employed is likely to give a thought crime answer to at least one of those questions.  Why is it that women are totally relaxed about widespread Muslim rape and tightly wound about nonexistent fraternity rape?
You are employed to shill communism to anarcho capitalists, in the same way that so many pastors are employed to shill gay sex, divorce, and fatherlessness to Christians, and the FBI employs so many people posing as anti semites to attack Trump.  And your place of employment has an HR department that prevents same thought crimes as every other HR department prevents.

The theory that capitalists are the ruling class is your spin on the anarchism of Spooner, Bastiat, and Gustav de Molinari.  It is not what they say.
You are commie telling anarcho capitalists that communism is the real anarcho capitalism, similar to the large supply of shills explaining that progressivism is the real antisemitism, the real reaction, and the real Christianity.
"Hail fellow Christian, I love God and Jesus, and by the way God demands gay marriage and you need to transition your boys at age nine to attend drag queen story hour"
"Hail fellow white male heterosexual, I hate Jews, and, by the way, Trump is an orange crypto Jew who fails at everything, so you should vote for a brown commie Democrat."

Here is how one can tell a paid shill from someone who actually believes what he is saying:
A paid shill can never commit a thought crime, because he is posting from an FBI office or university office on an FBI or university computer, and Human Resources would black list him if he committed thought crime.
So, to prove you are not yet another paid shill working from a shill office, commit a thought crime.
Here is a selection of questions with potential thought crime answers.
To prove you are not a paid shill working from a shill office, answer whichever question has the most unthinkable thought crime answer.
What caused the great minority mortgage meltdown?  (This question should be as easy as "what color is a black hole", but describe the mechanism and process)?
Why do a larger proportion of women in female majority workplaces report sexual harassment than women in workplaces that have only a small female Why are women extremely steamed about entirely imaginary fraternity rape, and totally relaxed about massive and widespread Muslim rape?
What proportion of new ventures headed by women, or with mixed male and female heads, fail, and why do almost all off them fail?
What is the cause of the high imprisonment rate of blacks, and the particularly high imprisonment rate of American blacks? hint, it might have something to do with your relative safety in certain streets.
What is the origin of Ashkenazim Jews, what is the connection between Ashkenazim and the crusades?

The "partnership" is one sided and brutally unequal, as becomes painfully visible every time a woman cries "sexual harassment"
You are a commie shill, shilling communism to anarcho capitalists.  And if you were not paid to shill and supervised by Human Resources in your shilling, you would have been able to commit a thought crime.
I challenged you to commit a thought crime, on any topic whatsoever, and you did not do so.  Dead giveaway that you are being paid to shill and supervised in your shilling.
All sexual harassment complaints, and all rape complaints about successful rapes by whites, as near to all of them as make no difference, are women running shit tests against men that they are sexually interested in.
When a man is sexually interested in a woman, he is nice to her.  When a woman is sexually interested in a man, she gives him shit to see if he is the shit, women being hypergamous, something that used to be routinely depicted in old movies, but is now no longer depicted in videos produced in the USG Hegemony, even in porn.
And the brutal one sidedness of the "partnership" is apparent whenever women deploy shit tests in the workplace.
Probably your employer is a university, since the FBI shills mainly shill trooferism, anti trump black pills, and solicit white people to commit stupid acts of pointless terrorism, while the university shills target the intellectuals.

The refusal to commit thought crimes is the tell tale giveaway of a shill - it shows he is working on a computer owned by his employer, and that HR can see what he writes.
Trooferism is an FBI operation to distract attention from the fact that they ignored the terrorists, being under orders from Mueller to ignore Muslim terrorism even when it got in their faces, and find white male Christian terrorism irrespective of whether it existed or not.
You blame the military, because the left hates the military, but you will not blame the FBI, which is the organization that regularly creates fake crimes, and which behaved very suspiciously in ignoring the terrorists.
And proof that Troofersim is an FBI shill operation is that Troofers will not criticize Mueller, or suggest his involvement, will not crticize the FBI, despite it being up to its neck in every real deep state conspiracy and they will not commit thought crimes.

Obviously Epstein had a little bit of help in his suicide.  From the screaming and the neck injuries, quite a lot of help.
And obviously whoever gave him that help had a lot of power, since they got the prison system to cooperate.
So, of the many many people who wanted him dead, the people in the best position to do it were the Clintons, who as we have seen in Inspector General Report, still have a lot of pull with the FBI.
So, most likely suspect, FBI acting on behalf of the Clintons.

You are blowing smoke to direct attention to anyone other than the Clintons and the FBI.
There are a whole lot of odd and suspicious deaths of people that the Clintons had reason to get rid of, Epstein's death being the most suspicious one yet.
Epstein is dead, because people inconvenient to the Clintons tend to wind up dead.
The criticism of  is that this would require a vast and improbably competent criminal conspiracy.
The FBI is vast, and you don't need to be competent in committing crimes if you have the FBI and the Justice Department in your pocket.  Notice that the FBI is investigating Epstein in a manner that reveals it does not want to discover anything about his death.
The striking difference between the way Barr is investigating, and the way the FBI is investigating, suggests FBI involvement in Epstein's suicide. The Justice Department was obviously in the Clintons' pocket until Barr was appointed, hence competent murder was not a requirement.

We cannot support a world population of billions without large amounts of energy.  Green energy projects invariably mean less energy, which invariably shuts down people's lifestyles.  People want to continue traveling around, hence the riots in Chile.
If warmists believed a word of their own bullshit, the money received for carbon offset credits would be spent on actually offsetting carbon emissions, for example by pulverizing olivine rocks and dumping them in the shallow ocean, stimulating the natural process where by calcium silicates get converted into silica and calcium carbonate.
Instead carbon credits money is spent on jetsetting around the world to pontificate on global warming.
If warmists believed a word of their own bullshit, green energy projects would produce useful energy, instead of superior holiness.
What green energy projects produce is shakedowns of the power grid.  You get higher energy prices, and frequently get blackouts and brownouts.
We could in fact produce the required energy without carbon emissions either using nuclear power, or by mining olivine to offset the carbon emitted by burning coal or oil, but the warmists have shown zero interest in actually producing energy without emitting net carbon.
That green energy projects never actually work shows that warmists do not in fact believe what they purport to believe.
Some of them want to murder billions of people, some of them want to seize the means of production, and most of them want to shake down the energy grid.
Revealed preference is that actually reducing CO2 emissions is mighty low on their list of priorities - or at least reducing CO2 emissions in ways that do not destroy industrial civilization and result in the deaths of billions of people is mighty low on their list of priorities.

You are talking of stuff you are incapable of understanding.  The two dimensional surface of a balloon has no edge, and the big bang has no edge.
It was not that everything was getting further away from some central point.  It was that everything was getting further away from everything.
At the hypothetical start of the big bang, everything was in one place, near enough, and there was no other place.  The very concept of dimensionality was ill defined since everything was close to everything else, there was no elsewhere.  You cannot even define the number of dimensions until some places are further away from other places.  There was no space as we understand space in ordinary daily life, and if there was time, not as we understand time.
The explosion was the three dimensions of space and the dimension of time coming into being, distance becoming large enough to be meaningful, so that it became possible for space and time to even have dimensionality, and then rapidly becoming enormous, so enormous that stuff that was once in the same place as us, there being no other place, indeed no places at all, is now so distant as to be outside our light cone, and likely to remain forever outside our light cone.

Morales used violence to "win" an election, electing him for an unconstitutional fourth term.
He then used violence against legislators and government officials. The army therefore had to threaten him with horizontal removal.
The army is now ensuring that the letter and spirit of the constitution is being followed to hold new elections.
Which elections strike me as likely to result in more of the same, since too much is up for grabs for people to follow the rules, and too many people on all sides have broken the rules.  Also people are voting their tribe, faith and ethnicity, which apt to end in tribal war.
We are already seeing this stuff in USA, with the deep state illegally tapping Trump's phone and fabricating evidence against him, and the governor of a Democratic party state sending thugs to break up a Trump rally, and police to protect those thugs against rally security (fed cops and rentacops), which tactics are bringing us closer in the US to political outcomes being resolved by security forces.  We got rather close to a fight between rally security and anti rally security.  As the 2020 election draws closer, and if Trump starts draining the swamp, we are likely to see such battles.
This is likely to result in a contested election, with the outcome being resolved by whether Trump manages to arrest the Democratic candidate for quid pro quo (Plenty of Biden quid pro quo, notably him pulling the Ukraine prosecutor off investigating his son, and him collecting billions while negotiating a mysteriously terrible trade deal with China) or Trump gets arrested for quid pro quo.
Democrats committed no end of arguably illegal acts when they thought that they would be in power forever, and if Trump drains the swamp, which he has ample legal grounds to do, he is likely to get through a constitutional amendment allowing him to exceed term limits, which amendment the Democrats will protest was not legally passed, and we will find ourselves in the same Bolivian situation - too much up for grabs for people to accept election outcomes, and security forces playing an ever increasing role in elections.

The alternative to people saving, investing and creating capital for return on capital is that the party creates capital by confiscating from the peasants, and tens of millions of peasants starve.
Profits are the return on capital, and the return on entrepreneurship. The alternative to entrepreneurship is the party tells you what to produce, and what you may consume, and we have seen how that works out.

The Nazis kidnapped Wernher von Braun from the rocket club, and put him in charge of building rockets.
Then the Americans kidnapped Wernher von Braun from the Nazis and gave him to what became NASA, and NASA asked him how to build rockets. And NASA built rockets, but their rockets *still* did not work.
So, they put him in charge, and *then* their rockets worked.
And eventually he retired, and then their rockets gradually stopped working.  Rockets stagnated and declined, until Musk started building Similarly everything electronic contains transistors.  Shockley wrote the book on transistors, and I suppose everyone in the business read the book, but somehow, in practice, every transistor everywhere in the world is built by an engineer who learned how to build transistors working under an engineer who learned how to build transistors working under .... an engineer who learned how to build transistors working in Shockley's company under Shockley.
You cannot even make a pencil, unless the boss provides you with tools and materials and tells you how to use those tools and materials.  You can no more make a pencil than you can make a rocket.

For a group of people to get anything done, someone has to be in charge.   And it will not be done right unless the guy in charge knows how it should be done.   I am sure we have both attended more than enough committee meetings.
When Wernher von Braun was merely sharing information and tutoring at NASA, the rockets did not work.  They had to put him in charge.
And when he retired, they still had all that information and the people he had tutored, but the rockets stopped getting better, started to get worse, and started to fail.
Shockley shared information and advised, he wrote the book, but transistors did not get built, except for a tiny number of not very reliable prototype transistors and those he personally and individually made.  When he formed a company of which he was the boss, *then* transistors were mass produced.
Rather more people can successfully operate a restaurant than can build rockets or transistors, but still, the vast majority of people cannot successfully operate a restaurant.  The vast majority of people who attempt to do so, fail.

The reason you need a boss to make a pencil is that almost no one knows how to make pencils - or any other common object, and the guy who does know is probably the boss of a pencil factory.

They are arguments against one big central plan, arguments for having lots of plans by lots of people, rather than one big plan.  But to build a rocket, build a building, or make a pencil, or run a restaurant, the *restaurant* needs one man with one plan, and everyone working at the restaurant follows his plan.
A business, like a family, has to be internally socialist, has to be externally market oriented.  But that a father has to run his family does not mean it is a good idea for the King, or the family court, to run everyone's family.

If you had even started to think about what would be necessary to make a pencil, you would have sketched in an outline of how you would go about it.   How for example, would you form graphite into pencil leads?  How do you form anything?  With your bare hands?  What tools would you need?
Hint:  You cannot buy a machine for forming pencil leads, because that kind of machine is a one off - most machines for forming specific shapes are one offs.  You have to make the machine, just as Ivan the Troll had to make one off devices that formed high strength, high melting point steel into gun parts, for those parts of a gun where one cannot use anything more easily shapeable, those parts where one cannot use a threedee printer or a numerically controlled lathe.
And the fact that you have not sketched an outline tells me that you lack the knowledge to even think about what would be needed.
Machines exist for making arbitrary threedee shapes using additive or subtractive technologies, but there are rather severe limits to the materials they can shape, and the shapes they can achieve, so that in practice you wind up using several such devices to make the things that make the things that make the thing that you actually want to make. They cannot shape pencil lead or wood, or rather they can, but not to the shapes you need for a pencil.
So you would need to think about the kind of devices you would need for making a pencil, and then think about how to make those devices.

We have plenty of existing societies that approximate anarchism.  In large parts of South East Asia the writ of the state runs mighty thin when you leave the cities.
All existing such societies are neither capitalist nor socialist.  It is dangerous for an outsider to wander about alone.  Rather they practice self sufficiency and gift economy.  Large scale economic activity is impractical.  As a result, they are mighty poor, which poverty is alleviated by remittances from young men and women sent away to work in more orderly places.
Capitalistic anarchic societies have existed, most famously Saga Period Iceland.  But though the state in Saga Period Iceland was barely existent, and did not possess a monopoly of legitimate force, Saga Period Iceland had a state religion - which state religion endorsed the right of individuals to themselves punish wrongs done to themselves and others, hence the weakness of the state.
It seems that you cannot get people to agree on what is lawful or unlawful without some sort of rather coercive imposition.  Some group of people is always going to concoct a real or imaginary grievance and demand compensation for real or imaginary sins. Saga period Iceland could have a market economy because they had substantial agreement on what constituted taking, and what to do about people who took stuff, substantial agreement on what was lawful or unlawful, this agreement being mediated by the Godar.  "Godar" is sometimes interpreted as chieftain, and they had a lot of power, but it means not chieftain, but God botherer, someone who prays, preaches to the congregation, and conducts religious rites.
What tends to happen in a state of anarchy is that people form tribalistic groups on the basis of race, religion and ethnicity, and then impose law that favors their group against outsiders.  Which leads to the development of the state, and when that somehow does not happen all that much, or the ensuing government is only strong in major population centers, life is insecure, and property considerably more insecure outside those centers.

There is an obvious problem with the non-aggression principle.  What do you do about large organized groups of people who aggress, and loudly proclaim the other guy is aggressing, and have crew of noisy public intellectuals (priests) explaining why the organized and dangerous group is in the right and doing good?  The other guy is supposedly price gouging, or emitting CO2, or hording, or engaging in usury (people who talk about usury are seldom aware of or interested in the way Christianity defined usury.  They just free money and to never have to pay it back.)
The union says that the employer is aggressing by locking unionized workers out and hiring non union labor, and bring up some cannon to make their point.
The Christian priest says that the priests of the Icelandic religion are aggressing, because they follow, and preach their followers to follow, the pagan rules on violence and law enforcement, which if successfully followed, are apt to result in Christians getting the short end of the stick, which was not a problem when everyone in Iceland followed the rules of the Icelandic gods, except for a few evildoers which evildoers tended to wind up dead.
The Christian priests argued for a Kingly monopoly of force, and they had a point, in that Icelandic priests were notoriously prone to ruling in favor of the guy with largest mob of armed supporters at the courtroom.
Hence the reactionary doctrine that you always wind up with a state religion.  In our case, instead of being required to believe in things unseen, we are required to disbelieve in things seen, such as racial and sexual differences, and bad female behavior in the workplace.

Just search uncensored social media.  You will find huge numbers of
videos of black gangs attacking whites.
Search the official organs of the state, such as the New York Times or CNN.
What do you find?
What do you find on the official organs of our officially unofficial
state religion?
You find a black "jogger" who was accosted by three white men after
committing a minor burglary, and grabbed the gun of one them by the
wrong end.
They are lying to you because it makes them holy.  It is like Christians
claiming to have witnessed miracles.
If any of miracles that they had witnessed actually happened, they would
be in the front page of the New York Times every day for the next twenty
Everyone remembers Emmett Till, who was not in fact lynched, but
murdered, like no end of men of all races who made a pass at someone
else's wife.  The problem was not that she was white and he was black,
but that she had a jealous husband.
If in the entire history of the all of the United States, one black had
been lynched who was not plausibly accused of some serious crime, that
black man would be the poster boy for lynchings, not Emmett Till.
If these things are happening, how come we cannot walk down the street
without being reminded of it by big character posters every ten feet?
Remember Jussie Smollet.  If she was telling you the truth, why is every
single such story that media hears turn out to be a lie?
Remember the  Covington Boys.
The media are so hungry for such incidents, that they invent them.  They
search high and low for such incidents, and have not found one such
incident in the past several decades.  Remember all the drama about a
garage door opener that someone thought looked vaguely like a noose.
Are you sure they did not express dislike of her because of theft and
assault?  Are you sure she did not just stop turning up to college
because she got bored, and told a better sounding story?
If white people actually broke down the door of a black college student
while expressing dislike of blacks, you would not be hearing it from her
and I not be hearing it from you.  I would be hearing it on television
for days or weeks or months.
There has not been one arbitrary lynching for frivolous cause anywhere
in the United States ever, nor one such incident as you describe
anywhere in the United States in the past few decades.
The media has shouted no end of such stories from the rooftops, and not
one single one has ever held up.

Every person in the world has seen the George Floyd video until they are
sick of it.
George Floyd was wrongfully killed, after engaging in violent acts
against black and white people, police among them, again and again again
and again all his life, among them two armed robberies, one of a
pregnant woman in her home, and getting a slap on the wrist for each of
his crimes.
If one keeps getting in fights with authority figures, eventually one of
them may well wrongfully kill one, but all the other times, they
wrongfully let him go on his merry way.
George Floyd wrongfully started a fight with police, while out of his
mind on drugs.  Police wrongfully ended it - but it happened to him, and
not to a white man, because George Floyd was out of his mind on a
cocktail of drugs that might well have killed him if the police did not,
and which certainly contributed to his death.
Meanwhile, at the George Floyd protests, many people have been
wrongfully killed, many innocent people have had their homes and
businesses burned down, many good men, many of them white, have suffered
grave injuries.
The number of black unarmed non felons killed by police is absolutely
insignificant.  The number of white unarmed non felons killed by police
is enormously larger, because black privilege means that cops cannot get
away with doing that to blacks, and can get away with doing that to
whites.  There is clear and overwhelming discrimination by cops and
judges against white people.
If a white man had George Floyd's record, he would not have been killed
by police because he would still be in jail.
And if, when he eventually, at long, long, long last, got out of jail,
he was killed the way George Floyd was killed, no one would notice and
no one would care.

Anyone who says "abolish the police" is saying some lives don't matter.
Civilized people who live among other civilized people don't need police
and policing, and for them police are a dangerous nuisance who give you
traffic tickets and whom the family court will send to kick down your
door.  But blacks need police very much, because blacks tend to live
around black people, and people who live around black people are subject
casual violence and high risk of violent death.

At 5:26, Floyd tells the police officers that he is “claustrophobic” —
this, to say that he does not want to get into the police SUV. Remember
that the supposedly claustrophobic Floyd had been pulled out from behind
the wheel of his own car. This claustrophobic man is not so afraid of
confined spaces that he can’t stand being in a car. A reasonable person,
by this point, might conclude that the clearly agitated Floyd is just
talking trash to keep the cops from arresting him. He has been talking
almost non-stop since the police first approached him, trying to
convince the police to let him go.
At 5:38, Floyd denies for a second time that he is on drugs.
What’s striking too at this point is how polite and non-confrontational
the police have been. They ask him repeatedly to get into the SUV.
“I’m gonna go in!” says Floyd, at 6:18.
“No, you’re not!” one of the cops replies — meaning in context, you’re
saying you’re going to do this thing, but you are in fact refusing to do it.
They order him four or five more times to get into the SUV. He keeps
refusing. He claims that he is afraid, that he’s claustrophobic, that he
won’t be able to breathe. Voices of bystanders tell him to do what the
cops tell him to do, to quit trying to “win.” Floyd says he’s “not
trying to win.”
And then several more times, they order him to get in the car. One
officer goes around to the other side, to try to pull Floyd in. Floyd
offers to get into the front seat. No, an officer says. Floyd keeps
resisting. At 7:48, he’s still resisting and shrieking, and the
frustrated voice of an officer says, “Take a seat!”
Around 8:12, they finally put Floyd on the ground. He is continuing to
protest, “I can’t breathe!”
That’s the end of the above video. We know what happened next
Because Floyd was lying about not being on drugs, and lying about being
claustrophobic, cops did not believe he could not breath.  Probably he
was lying about being unable to breath, because he could still speak.
Because he was unreasonably persistent in resisting, they put pressure
on his neck for considerably longer than is safe to do so, and because
he had coronary disease, that hold was even less safe than it usually
is. (And it is not very safe if you continue longer than twenty seconds
or so, which is all that is normally necessary.)

Slaves in Africa were generally people seized by the local authorities
for vagrancy and petty theft (the penalty for everything else being
death)  Some of them were populations engaged in stubborn but
unsuccessful rebellion.  If they had not been sold off, would probably
have been eaten.
They were vastly better off in America then, and their descendants are
vastly better off than the descendants of those that remained behind.
Segregation was good for whites and good for blacks.  Look at the school
cafeteria.  Blacks don't want to hang out with whites, and whites don't
want to hang out with blacks.
Diversity plus proximity equals war.
Segregation created a black middle class, that had real jobs and real
families, because it needed black shops, black cops, black judges, and
black lawyers.  Before desegregation, black men had wives, and black
universities turned out blacks with skills in something other than
hating white.
Desegregation has destroyed city after city, starting with Detroit, and
it has destroyed black people, who are now fatherless and now live on
crime and welfare.
Whites fled Detroit because black people were beating up white people
and burning down their homes.  Without white people to keep everything
running, Detroit collapsed.
When blacks were no longer sent to the back of the bus, white people
stopped using buses because they got beaten up.
Blacks commit more crime, and the most severe inequalities in
incarceration are in Democratic states with an indulgent attitude
towards crime, especially black crime.
The question is not what proportion of a race get imprisoned, but what
proportion of criminals of a race get imprisoned, and it is absolutely
obvious that blacks are more likely to get away with crimes, or not be
punished even if caught, than whites.
It is absolutely obvious that blacks can get away with crimes more than
white people, due to less enforcement, a revolving door policy by
judges, and a remarkably indulgent attitude to attacks by colored people
on whites.
And strange to report, the more indulgent the State Government towards
crime, especially black crime, the more unequal the incarceration rate.
 If racism caused inequality in incarceration rates, why are the
inequalities distributed the way they are. By and large, the more
progressive the state government the worse the disparity.
Try to imprison less people, you are apt to wind up with a larger
proportion of blacks in prison relative to whites in prison.
What happens is that if you simply imprison less and police less, this
decreases white imprisonment considerably but does not much decrease
black imprisonment because it increases crime, and increases black crime
more than white crime. Imprisoning lots of people reduces crime, but it
reduces black crime considerably more, reducing the disparity in
imprisonment rates.  Black crime seems to be more sensitive to policing
and enforcement than white crime, perhaps because blacks get less
policing and enforcement than whites, so increasing enforcement on
whites yields decreasing returns.
If you make an effort to rehabilitate prisoners, and get them out of
jail without them promptly needing to be returned, this tends to have
more success with white prisoners, and again your disparity increases.
George Floyd being a good example of someone who just needed to be kept
permanently out of circulation as a danger to himself and others.
Letting him out of prison with a slap on the wrist did not work out well
for anyone.

The Topic was Karl's deluded belief that whites were physically
attacking blacks in America with impunity today, while the reality is
that this simply never happens, hence the desperate and ever
unsuccessful efforts of the mainstream media to find a poster boy, while
in fact there are continual group attacks by blacks on whites with
impunity, which attacks are indulged and tolerated by authority.
There were white slaves in America before there were black slaves in
America.  The Muslim world had been raiding white countries for slaves
for a long time.
The Barbary wars were fought over Muslims enslaving white Americans.
American slaves were not enslaved by Americans but purchased from black
people who had enslaved other black people, for the most part enslaved
them for cause (petty crime or rebellion) and according to law
applicable at the time, and the descendants of those black people are
still selling slaves to Muslims today, as for example in Libya.
Those slaves sold by their black owners to Americans were vastly better
off in America than they would have been in Africa, and their
descendants are vastly better off in America than in Africa.
Their descendants in America live largely on crime and welfare, and are
dependent on the wealth produced by whites, as was illustrated when they
drove whites out of Detroit.

Under segregation, blacks generally had fathers and real families, and
performed meaningful and productive jobs under a black middle class that
segregation and Jim Crow artificially created.
Under desegregation, they generally do not have fathers, and are

on crime and welfare, or work in meaningless affirmative action jobs

it does not get any interesting secret keys, because the master key for

Government is demonstrably incapable of creating technology.
Like government radar, NASA’s government rockets did not go anywhere.
If socialism could do science and technology, then the Soviet Union and
Mao’s China would have had better stuff.
Wherever you see a military with decent technology, it is because they
have a healthy private sector to buy it from or confiscate it from.
If socialism could produce high tech …
The difference is so obvious and enormous that you can see it from
space: The difference is simple and glaringly obvious. Government cannot
produce science and technology, except by buying it or confiscating it
from private actors.
When the US captured Wernher von Braun it tried to build rockets and
failed. It asked him how his rockets were built, it looked at his
rockets, and it still failed. When it put him in charge, then it
succeeded. And when he died, rocketry stopped advancing until Space X.
Government funded him to build bigger rockets, probably bigger than the
private sector would have or could have. But it funded him because he
was already building rockets, as Hewlett Packard had already been
building electronic equipment, which work was disrupted, not sponsored,
by the wartime electronic counter measures work.
German rocketry started with the Verein für Raumschiffahrt (Society for
space travel). German rockets were based on VFR work, and American and
Russian rockets based on German work. And the Nazis shut down VFR, as
the American Government shut down Hewlett Packard.
Silicon Valley was not born of the Harvard Group’s Electronic Counter
measures. If it had been, Silicon Valley would be located in Harvard,
where almost every member of the Electronic Counter Measures group was
and remained. Rather, the Harvard group’s electronic counter measures
were born of seizing what was in Hewlett Packard’s garage, much as the
V2 and the space program was born of seizing what was in the garages of
VFR members.
That Silicon Valley happened where the government stole technology from,
(Hewlett Packard’s garage in Palo Alto) not where they stole technology
to (Harvard) shows that government did not cause Silicon Valley.
Similarly, NASA could not build rockets, except they put a man the Nazis
kidnapped from the VFR, and that they kidnapped from the Nazis, in charge.
Observe the Soviet Union.  Before the revolution, Russians were among
the world leaders in creating planes and such.
After the revolution, Lenin had to hire American experts, and all Soviet
cars were inferior knockoffs of American cars.
They did OK in building guns and suchlike, but that was Russian
socialism competing with American socialism.

Reality is that all government technology is stolen or purchased from
the private sector, and that when the government steals technology from
the private sector, it has to kidnap the people who created it, and when
those people retire, the technology gradually goes to shit.
The historical fact is that the VFR, not the German government, created
liquid fuel rockets, and a man kidnapped from the VFR created the moon
rocket.  And when that man retired from NASA, rockets started going
downhill until Musk created a private rocket with private money from his
own wealth, and the wealth of similar people.
Russian nukes were stolen American technology, which were based on
stolen private technology and people kidnapped from the private sector,
as NASA's big liquid fueled rockets were based on the VFR's tiny liquid
fueled rockets and a man kidnapped from the VFR.
And since those men have, like Von Braun, retired, nukes have been going
downhill.  America can no longer make lithium six, tritium, or plutonium
238, which makes it unlikely that our nukes still work.
The people in charge of our nukes want a lead time before testing a
nuke, which lead time just happens to be long enough that they are
likely to get a different, and perhaps more malleable, president before
the inconvenience of actually testing a nuke.
If they cannot test a bomb at short notice, unlikely to be able to blow
up an enemy at short notice.
Russian nuclear reactors stagnated with ours, until Putin, whose new
improved nuclear reactors were created by private sector contractors.

Nah, the intent is not to rule the skies, but to rule the ground.
Turkey has radically transformed the nature of war.
One drone can take out four tanks, or four mobile artillery, or four
small groups of soldiers.  Then fly back to a hastily improvised very
small air strip, and reload.
Its small size plus its excellent stealth makes it hard to shoot down.
It makes tanks, artillery, and large groups of soldiers obsolete,
because it can do most of the things and tank or mobile artillery can
do, plus it can blow up tanks and mobile artillery, and tanks and mobile
artillery cannot blow it up.
The peak of technology is the fighter plane.  Why do you need fighter
To blow up ground support planes like the famous A10, the warthog.
Well, the Turkish drone is a ground support plane that your fighter
cannot easily find.  Most of our military apparatus has become obsolete.
Each drone carries four end guided anti tank or anti personnel missiles
or bombs, that it can land right on a pocket handkerchief from a

Republic (elections, due process, etcetera dead) there is no means of
resolving conflicts within the elite, which will turn increasingly
violent.  Eventually one man will seize total power - either a rightist,

Right now we have Soros and Trump looking for the job, but chaos may

Whoever it is will punish them - if a leftist, the Revolution devours

Either way whoever becomes dictator will kick down the ladder by which

This comment has not aged well.
I have confidence in Trump, and waited to see.  Lots of people have underestimated Trump, and it has seldom worked out well for them.
He responded to Iran's response as I expected and hoped.
And Iran's response (symbolic escalation covering actual de-escalation, revealing that the killing of Solemieni was successful in deterring them from the war effort that they have been escalating ever since Obama's nuke deal) was what I had hoped it would be and doubtless what Trump expected it to be.
It takes two to make peace, only one to make war.  Iranians are not chanting "America should get off the bloodstained sands so that we can make them even bloodier".  They are chanting "Death to America". Similarly, read the comment section of internet articles that appeared about Khamenei's response to Trump's threat, shortly before Trump nailed Lots of Iranians in the comment sections promising to kill us, confidently telling us we are weak and will be destroyed.
The comment sections have fallen silent about our weakness and their prospects for destroying us.
The timeline of events was Twitter diplomacy:
Trump on New Year's day:
 > Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat.
To which Khamenei responded on Twitter:
 > You can’t do anything.
Comment sections fill with Shiites gloating "Death to America", telling us America is weak, that they will destroy us.
Whereupon Trump kills Khamenei's buddy and top general.
Comment sections fill with rage, but optimism that we are weak and that they will destroy us evaporates.
That is a mighty good outcome.  We have no alternative but to make those that hate us, fear us.  Where the comment sections were full of gloating at our weakness, now fear at our strength.
Obama's nuke deal was seen as weakness, and escalated their messianic expectation that they would conquer us, however absurd that expectation seems to some of us.

Soros and the Southern Poverty Law center are Jewish, a lot more Jewish

ranting about Jews (but not progressive Jews in power like Soros and
Victoria Nuland, but instead powerless Orthodox Jews wearing funny hats,
nationalist Jews in Israel, and Jews that are dead and their descendants
out of power for nearly a century), is a counter narrative intended to
shut down the Soros narrative.
This counter narrative (Rothschilds, Rothschilds, Rothschilds,
Rothschilds, Israel, Netanyahue, Orthodox Jews, blah blah blah) appears
to come from Soros shills.
Marxism is a Jewish heresy, that parallels the digger heresy of
Christianity, and Marxists have always had it in for Orthodox Jews,
Marxism being one of the many religions that has sprung from that father
of religions.
Dialectics is Talmudism rebranded, "History" is the Jewish God
rebranded, and "Vanguard of the proletariat" is the replacement for the
Jewish people.

A single source of truth is convenient, user friendly, and efficient.
Trouble is it becomes entrenched, and thus becomes a high value target,
what economists call an attractive nuisance.  Evil people infiltrate,
enter, take it over, and make it a source of lies instead of truth.
Hence the purging of Linus and Stallman.  And hence when I add a valid
desktop file to ~/.config/autostart in Debian running Gnome3, it dies.
The best solutions combine both, with an automatic failover mechanism
should the single source crash or go off the internet, or if any
subgroup of peers stop  accepting its truth.
What should happen if it goes down is that few people notice, they just
wind up, after a slight delay, connecting to the peer that was next in
line to become the single source of truth if the one first in line went
down.  Maybe the most recent updates get lost and have to be resubmitted.
Git was designed on the no single source of truth model, and a lot of
its user hostility in collaboration is a result of this architecture,
so anyone trying to facilitate collaboration using git is apt to drift
away from this model to the locked in, locked down, single source of

Should we make pornography illegal?
[A] No, because male desire for sexual gratification is not causing
society any problems. Now, we should ban gay, tranny, and cuck porn. And
we should ban romance novels, i.e. porn for women. But heterosexual
porn, especially if it depicts violent rape, will be allowed, and
documentation of little prepubescent girls fucking their dogs will be
required material for anyone who wants to be a member of the priesthood,
not because it is nice to watch, but because it is incredibly red pilling.
[B] No, because pornography allows us to learn about various fetishes
and alternative sexual practices, and that is valuable knowledge.
[C] Yes, because pornography is how the (((Synagogue of Satan)))
destroyed our TFR. Before the advent of pornography, there were fecund
marriages and stable families, but then we let in these Semitic
parasites, and they singlehandedly turned all our women to porn sluts
and all our men to incels. Were it not for Jewish pornographers, we
would all have big families, just like we had in Hitler’s Germany.
Similarly to Brave New World, the Jews are using our own desires to
control us – so it’s more like a Brave JEW World, am I right?
[D] No, but Child Porn should still be illegal, because whenever you
look at an image of a child being abused, you are both encouraging the
production of more CP, and repeating the original abuse.
[E] No, but we should require all porn actors to wear condoms, in order
to protect the actors and actresses from venereal diseases, and to teach
the viewers — who are often our own sons — to use contraceptives. Porn
is spiritual poison, but it’s not realistic to ban all of it, so we
should focus instead on protecting the sex workers — who are often our
own daughters in college — from exploitation and bad working conditions.

This is true, and is the argument for anarcho capitalism.
If people are left alone to live their lives, they need to have stuff to
live it with, property.  Other people will covet their stuff, and their
entire lifestyle, if it is a peaceful, cooperative and happy lifestyle,
which covetousness fueled rage has been spectacularly on display in
antifa and BLM attacks on the suburbs.
They will demand inclusion, and if included will destroy the productive
high trust, cooperative, community, so need to be excluded.  Observe the
catastrophic impact of codes of conduct on the open source community.
So people gang up to predate on other communities, and other communities
have to gang up to protect themselves.
And thus you get states and state religions, the largest scale ganging
up, and the most extreme for of violence by the gang.  If you don't have
a state and state religion, you get conquered.  When a hostile elite
fails to protect the community that created it, you get state failure,
as is happening in the US.
And the only way out is a loyalist elite, and loyalist state religion.
Trump and the Trumpists love America and the greatness of our ancestors,
and the Christianity that Trump trumpets, but probably does not take too
seriously, loves America.  Trump's God loves America and the greatness
of our ancestors.
The deep state elite hates America and Americans, as was apparent in the
Paris Treaty and the Trade Pacific Partnership.
It is also apparent in their art of the deep state elite and the Harvard
If you twit a member of the elite over the shittiness of a Mondrian or a
Picasso, he may well condescend that he is a sophisticated art
appreciator and you are  not.  Maybe he is, though I doubt it.  Twit him
over the dog poop statue in the bay area, the reply is likely to amount
to "Racist".
That statue is just our elite giving us the finger, same as tearing down
the statue of Lincoln and vandalizing Churches.
You reckon that when they smash their way into a Church and behead the
statue of the mother of Christ, it is a signal of sophistication?
Nah, it is a signal they have power, we don't, and they hate us.  Same
thing the dog poop statue signals.  They want to erase all signs of our
past greatness.
Compare and contrast with Putin's great Cathedral, which celebrates the
past greatness of Russia and Western Civilization.
If you try to get an member of the elite to give you the supposed
rationale for the dog poop statue, he will garble it incoherently, if he
responds at all, thereby not even trying to display sophistication.  The
reply, if you get a reply at all, is going to be "racist" - If you
object to our erasure, you are racist.  That is what it is all about,
and the reply is likely to be related to what it is in fact about.
When people make a show of appreciating Mondrians, they are usually
indeed signaling sophistication, as well as signalling their progressive
credentials, that they support the erasure of our history and
civilization.  If they appreciate the dog poop statue, they are
performing a victory dance over their defeated enemies, and if you twit
them on it, they are unlikely to even try to signal sophistication.  It
is analogous to what we saw with debate on George Zimmerman - the people
arguing that George Zimmerman assaulted Trayvon Martin were not making
arguments that supported their supposed story, they were making
arguments that Trayvon Martin was entitled to attack George Zimmerman,
that black people have aristocratic privilege to use violence on peons
when treated with less respect than they are rightly entitled to by
virtue of their superior status, that a white person is guilty of
assault should he attempt to defend himself.

The easy money policies of Greenspan had nothing to do with it.
The problem was criminal misconduct.  Vast numbers of dud mortgages were

The basic problem was that the Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating
Organizations (NRSROs) had long been committing criminal misconduct
without going to jail, and the financial crisis was them committing even
more criminal misconduct and not going to jail for it.
Which made the criminal misconduct by Angelo Mozilo possible.

Race is based on ancestry - different groups have different evolutionary
histories, resulting in important inward differences.
Some of the descendants of the common ancestor of chimp and man remained
in an environment very similar to that of chimps, and were in
consequence subject to less evolutionary pressure to make them into a
creature very different from a chimp.
Some of the descendants of the common ancestor of chimp and man headed
north, a long way north, and eventually inland, and adapted to extremely
cold winters and large changes in seasonal availability of food, not by
changing physically, but by changing mentally - making much higher use
stored food, shelter, clothing, and tools.
This required higher levels of forethought and more extended cooperation

The poster girl rule is that the if the poster girl or poster boy for X

Obama administration told University campuses that there was a rape
crisis on campus - which in a sense is true, but not at all true in the
sense that the Obama administration intended.  From the point of view of
women, the problem is that white high status big men on campus are not
raping them.  Women really don't like consent culture. In their bones,
they feel that consent is failing a shit test.  But they cannot express
this, even to themselves, so they express it in words that are socially
approved, but the real meaning of the words is inverted.
Obama administration, finding it strangely impossible to punish these
supposed rapes through the courts, commanded university admin to punish
them administratively.

We, meaning we white straight Christian males, would love to suppress
rape and sexual harassment, but women are not cooperating.
The only way to suppress it is to go back to eighteenth century, or
better, the very similar Old Testament, law and custom on sex and
family, in which the victim and complainant is the man who has rightful
authority over the woman's sexual and reproductive services, and her
consent is only relevant to her guilt, not to the guilt of the man who
had sex with her, or took her behind closed doors.

Musk is not aiming at people in the cities, and probably will not aim at
them until he get forty thousand satellites up.
His initial target is underserved locations, and with only eight hundred
satellites up, cities would overwhelm his capability.
Eight hundred is the bare minimum needed to provide rural service in
northerly areas.
He is hoping to launch another fifteen hundred satellites in the next
year, which should suffice for world wide service, but only in thinly
populated regions, the countryside, the exurbs, and small towns - quite
small towns.
He does not intend to provide substantial service to urban centers ever.
 Fiber and 4G makes more sense in dense areas.  In city centers,
Starlink will be a high priced premium service for people who want short
ping times to the other side of the earth.
But, once he gets enough satellites up, it is going to make economic
sense to put modest sized server clusters out in the middle of nowhere,
and going to be easier to have a multiple server cluster around the
world that acts like a single large server cluster from the point of
view of its customers.

@_subject: US Homeland Security Can Now Track Privacy Crypto Monero 
I have examined Monero's security.
I did not find a way to break it, but it failed to inspire me
with confidence.
There are lots of cryptographers vastly better than I am, but they
tend to suffer from the mighty unbreakable fortress wall syndrome.
They build crypto that is utterly unbreakable against the threat
as defined, and all the ways around their unbreakable wall are
declared to be out of scope.
And there are lots of cryptographers, me being one of them, who
are aware of the fact that you need walls on all sides, but are
apt to screw up the crypto.  Monero struck me as being of even
less than my own regrettable level of cryptographic competence,
(I would not have fucked up over non prime order elliptic points)
and somewhat less than my level of awareness of the need for walls
to properly link up with each other.
The problem with Monaro, is that though it avoids the direct linking
of transactions that bitcoin suffers from, it leaks a whole lot of
data about networks of people transacting with each other, and I
suspect that some of the time, the data that it does leak is
sufficient to make a pretty good guess of what is going on behind
the mighty fortress walls of cryptography, that sometimes it
is bulletproof, and sometimes the bullets get through.
I don't think anyone has broken it - I certainly could not -
but I expect that the adversaries are making efficient use of
what it does leak - that they can find interesting information in
what is out of scope of its security model.
I favor Wasabi wallet, which mingles your bitcoins with those of a
large number of other people.
The Lightning network solves the problem that bitcoin has of
transaction linkability, but you then have the correspondence
banking problem, that too many "trusted" intermediaries know
who is transacting with whom.
There is a flaw in the human user interface of the Lightning
network's system of trust.  We need a Lightning network that
has less need for trust, and a human interface that is more human,
so you know whom you are trusting.

Monero's blockchain necessarily leaks quite a bit of information.
Perhaps the information is completely useless to an attacker.
It is certainly useless to an attacker who attempts to to figure
out who is transacting with whom by performing the attacks
specifically defined and addressed.  Monaro is clearly invulnerable
to the bitcoin problem.
Whether the attacker can put the bits and pieces together and
frequently make a good guess as to what is happening behind the
curtain is unclear to me, and I doubt it is much clearer to
the developers of Monero.
I don't see a survey and and analysis looking for the gaps between
the  mighty unbreakable fortress walls, and am disinclined to
perform such an analysis.
If _I_ was a Monero contributor and developer, I would have such
a survey and analysis at my fingertips.  What _can_ an attacker do
by analyzing the blockchain, and what patterns in the blockchain
would he notice?  In what ways do your activities when you use
Monero cause the blockchain to differ from white noise to someone
without your private keys?
It is really hard to do new stuff securely while using a group of
composite order.
It did not seem to me that they were aware of how hard it is.
The problem was not that their algorithms were necessarily new.  The
problem was that these new algorithms were necessarily implemented on a
group of composite order.
We know he screwed up.  Would I have screwed up?   You don't know and
I am not sure, but I know I would have sweated bullets, being aware
of how difficult it is to avoid such screw ups, and having studied
other people's efforts to work around the problem.
The problem is vastly less worse than Bitcoin.  Monaro is better
in this regard than Bitcoin.  Whether it is enough better to make
a big important difference is disturbingly unclear.
I have not attempted to scrutinize Zcash, which uses cryptography well
beyond my limited competence.
But I am sufficiently competent to understand Wasabi, which is what I am
indeed promoting.
If zcash works as described, the blockchain should look like white
noise to an attacker without the private keys.
Whether it _does_ look like white noise is beyond my abilities
to determine.
This is the sudoko attack.
When Wasabi was issued, it was vulnerable to the sudoko attack,
which could typically track about half the coins through a
transaction, but _now_ countermeasures have been applied against
that attack.
The sudoko attack should have been foreseen, and it was not.  But
_now_ there is an effort to check the mighty fortress walls to make
sure there are no gaps between the mighty fortress walls that an
attacker who declines to play by your security model can use.
Yes, this is an important vulnerability of Wasabi transactions.  They
can detect that you have laundered money, though once the money has been
laundered, they can track it no further. But Monaro _itself_ stands out,
while Wasabi transactions are just more bitcoin transactions.
If everyone used Monaro, Monaro would not stand out, and if everyone
used Wasabi, Wasabi transactions would not stand out.
To use crypto currency, you are apt to wind up laundering bitcoin by
converting it to Monaro, which transaction tends to be highly traceable,
and then converting it back to Bitcoin, which transaction tends to be
highly traceable, and then actually paying someone with bitcoin, whereas
if you are using wasabi, you are paying with the equivalent of crumpled
used notes that the mafia collected from the laundry.

The lightning network could in principle solve both scaling problems

The lightning people have a forked bitcoin, but I think their fork

Maybe they will get it right eventually.  Satoshi proved that it

network - and easy to criticize bitcoin itself, but bitcoin changed
