@_subject: what to install on a secure communication device 
libpurple may be a "rat's nest of zero days", but irssi+otr is a nightmare
to get working properly.  I've given up on it, and I've started using
mcabber+otr instead.
bitlbee+otr might be a better choice, and might provide the same network
access as libpurple, with irssi as the interface.  However, I can't comment
as to the usability of such a configuration.
