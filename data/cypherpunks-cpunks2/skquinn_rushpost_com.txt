@_subject: patents in a free society (Re: Brother can you help a  fiber?) 
I agree with the concepts of copyrights, patents (for physical
inventions only), trademarks, trade dress, and trade secrets.
I disagree completely with the use of the term "intellectual property"
because the laws governing copyrights, patents, trademarks, trade dress,
and trade secrets are not property laws. Not only is the term
"intellectual property" deceptive, misleading, and ambiguous, the people
who brought it to us are the same ones who would love to shut down
BitTorrent and similar information sharing technologies.

It is worth the extra $20 or so per year to not have Google be able to
cross-reference my search history with my email, and better still to be
free of Google's stupid irrelevant or sometimes overly relevant ads in
my email. It's bad enough when I browse a site and immediately see both
Google ads when I browse elsewhere, and then Facebook ads for it when I

As best I can tell, the article refers to blocking access from the

connections to external corporate web servers. They also recommend
things like blocking personal VPN servers.
My concern is that they take the stance that allowing Tor is a
liability. Sure, there are people who will abuse Tor, but the benefits
of being able to access, say, Pepsi's web site without revealing you're
doing so from Coca-Cola's corporate network should not be ignored.
That's what Tor was originally intended to be used for, among other
things. I concede it was inevitable that some would use it for evil, but
isn't that true about a lot of things?

The thing that really irks me the most about TrueCrypt being withdrawn
was that it was the only true multi-platform (GNU/Linux and Windows at
least, was there a Mac OS X version?) full-disk encryption software
available under a free software license. Every other full disk
encryption solution out there is either proprietary, only available for
one operating system, or both.
To me, any true successor to TrueCrypt will be available under GPLv3
(not sure I like the idea of someone forking a BSD/MIT licensed clone
and then not sharing the source, aka the "BSD/MIT Tuck And Run"), and
for at least GNU/Linux and Windows (ideally Mac OS X as well). While I
never really needed something like TrueCrypt while it was maintained,
that doesn't mean I won't in the future, and I know there are others who

with "family-friendly" filtering built in. Spyware or logging of sites
accessed wouldn't be too far of a leap from this.

packages to not consider "parental control" type tools as spyware and

There's no easy way to detect screenshots being taken. You would need to
check the local hard disk for copies of the screenshots, and outbound
network traffic for something that could be a screenshot being uploaded.
This is difficult at best without administrator access.
It would be best, but it may not be possible if the computer is secured
correctly. The parent threat model (as a minor child) is a particularly
tough nut to crack. Even if you subvert the technical spying measures,
there could be consequences for doing so. At least where I live in the
US, minors can't own property legally, so parents can spy on a computer
that  "belongs to" their kids.
If your friend's parents feel the need to spy on his/her Internet
access, there are issues beyond the technological ones. There is a basic
lack of trust on the part of the parents, possibly caused by their poor
parenting of your friend when he/she was younger, that needs to be
addressed. In other words, find out why they feel spying is necessary.
In the meantime, your friend may want to do the majority of his/her
Internet access from the local library; it may not be completely
uncensored but there is a much lower chance of being individually spied
on there.

It's really hard to take a site seriously when it opens with a pop-up
for a boycott of a cereal company (Kellogg's) that just did what any
company would do when a site they advertise on continues to act contrary
to that company's values.
I actually wanted to blog about this, but absent a source for a similar

The manner in which it was said did play a role. A banner off to the
side talking about the boycott (which I was aware of) would have been a
bit more reasonable. Yes, I'm equally annoyed about it when progressive
news sites do the same thing, but usually there's some justification to
it (i.e. Nestlé and this urge of theirs to bottle up water, especially
in places like Michigan not too far outside of Flint).
Breitbart is calling for the boycott themselves, just because Kellogg's
pulled their ads. They are making it sound like Kellogg's is attacking
the company, even though their PR guy clearly said the move is not
political in nature.
It's funny how both Rush Limbaugh and Breitbart seem to have problems
keeping advertisers. Pop quiz: what do they have in common?

@_date: 2016-12-03 23:25:45
@_author: Shawn K. Quinn 
@_subject: USA Universities learn the consequences of disrespecting free 
Apparently customers of Kellogg had complained after seeing ads on
Breitbart. The stories I'm seeing are light on details.
They should be calling for boycotts on Allstate, Warby Parker, and BMW
And those four brands are the start of an undoubtedly long list,
combined with many other companies, some of which have yet to be
actually launched, who have removed advertising on Breitbart from
consideration but said nothing about it.
Profit. The same reason Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Procter & Gamble, and...
well all the companies listed here:
sell in China. I guess you're going to boycott all of them too?
You'd have to ask them to be sure, but I'm pretty sure it's about
maximizing profits and market share. Abandoning the market just ensures
someone else will step in and take those same profits, and that will not
keep the shareholders happy.
Note that I'm not saying it's right that this is the way things are.
Public companies have to do what is in the best interests of the
shareholders, or they can get sued. Among other tragedies, this is why
there's a huge grassy field where Six Flags Astroworld used to be.

No E
There is no obligation that they advertise with Breitbart. Or, for that
matter, that they even advertise at all. (See No-Ad sunscreen, which as
its name implies hasn't been advertised, and has been sold most of the
time I've been alive and is still out there. It's actually pretty good
sunscreen too. I guess you'd boycott them too, as they don't advertise
on Breitbart either?)
Kellogg's wanted to retain their customers. Their customers didn't want
the company supporting Breitbart with advertising. So, they quit
advertising on Breitbart. I don't blame them; their shareholders would
throw a shitfit if they lost customers by continuing to run their ads in
spite of known customer dissatisfaction with what is being paid for by
those ads, and the lost profit that would result from lost customers had
they simply maintained the status quo.
And yeah, 1 + 1 = 2 (see Lou Bega - A Little Bit of Mambo, track 9)

Companies decide that an advertising contract no longer suits their
business needs, whatever those needs may be, all the time. Often they
don't write a press release about it and explain their choices, but
apparently in this case Kellogg's got enough complaints that they felt
this was necessary.
Again, purchases of advertising in the past do not in any way create an
obligation for purchases of advertising in the future.
"Free speech" refers to freedom, not price. You can say what you like,
but don't expect an advertiser to fund it for you if it is hate speech,
conflicts with their company values, or their customers' values. You are
welcome to do what you like, of course; personally I'm inclined to
celebrate the willingness of Kellogg's to take a stand with a bowl of
Frosted Flakes (or maybe Frosted Mini-Wheats, I haven't decided yet).

First, why the hell are you running an anonymous FTP server in 2016?!
FTP needs to die... it was designed in an era where it was acceptable to
send passwords across the internet in plain text. That era is long gone.
HTTP (really HTTPS now) for downloads, and SFTP/SCP for the use cases
where HTTP(S) won't really fit.
Second, if I remember right, .scr *is* a type of Windows executable
(originally used for screensavers). Thank Microsoft for that one... most
people wouldn't recognize .scr the way they would, say, .exe, .dll, and
the like. This is why I like the Unix method a lot better: if you want
to run something, you either have to feed it to something like bash or
python on the command line, or give it execute permissions. Of course,
the flip side of this is that mounting stuff over SMB has the executable
bit set on everything, even stuff for which an execute action would not
make any sense... which kind of shoots down this rudimentary security
mechanism. (Again, blame Microsoft, who clearly thinks the existence of
an execute permission bit is redundant.)

It's really hard to take a site seriously when it opens with a pop-up
for a boycott of a cereal company (Kellogg's) that just did what any
company would do when a site they advertise on continues to act contrary
to that company's values.
I actually wanted to blog about this, but absent a source for a similar
article without a ridiculous pop-up in front of it, I'm probably not
going to. Which is sad.

My point is not that the pop-up is there. My point is how such a
one-sided, deceptive message discredits everything on that site.

The manner in which it was said did play a role. A banner off to the
side talking about the boycott (which I was aware of) would have been a
bit more reasonable. Yes, I'm equally annoyed about it when progressive
news sites do the same thing, but usually there's some justification to
it (i.e. Nestlé and this urge of theirs to bottle up water, especially
in places like Michigan not too far outside of Flint).
Breitbart is calling for the boycott themselves, just because Kellogg's
pulled their ads. They are making it sound like Kellogg's is attacking
the company, even though their PR guy clearly said the move is not
political in nature.
It's funny how both Rush Limbaugh and Breitbart seem to have problems
keeping advertisers. Pop quiz: what do they have in common?

Apparently customers of Kellogg had complained after seeing ads on
Breitbart. The stories I'm seeing are light on details.
They should be calling for boycotts on Allstate, Warby Parker, and BMW
And those four brands are the start of an undoubtedly long list,
combined with many other companies, some of which have yet to be
actually launched, who have removed advertising on Breitbart from
consideration but said nothing about it.
Profit. The same reason Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Procter & Gamble, and...
well all the companies listed here:
sell in China. I guess you're going to boycott all of them too?
You'd have to ask them to be sure, but I'm pretty sure it's about
maximizing profits and market share. Abandoning the market just ensures
someone else will step in and take those same profits, and that will not
keep the shareholders happy.
Note that I'm not saying it's right that this is the way things are.
Public companies have to do what is in the best interests of the
shareholders, or they can get sued. Among other tragedies, this is why
there's a huge grassy field where Six Flags Astroworld used to be.

No E
There is no obligation that they advertise with Breitbart. Or, for that
matter, that they even advertise at all. (See No-Ad sunscreen, which as
its name implies hasn't been advertised, and has been sold most of the
time I've been alive and is still out there. It's actually pretty good
sunscreen too. I guess you'd boycott them too, as they don't advertise
on Breitbart either?)
Kellogg's wanted to retain their customers. Their customers didn't want
the company supporting Breitbart with advertising. So, they quit
advertising on Breitbart. I don't blame them; their shareholders would
throw a shitfit if they lost customers by continuing to run their ads in
spite of known customer dissatisfaction with what is being paid for by
those ads, and the lost profit that would result from lost customers had
they simply maintained the status quo.
And yeah, 1 + 1 = 2 (see Lou Bega - A Little Bit of Mambo, track 9)

Mr. Harkness,
I refuse to engage in debate with anyone who is willing to basically say
they approve of the KKK and the type of hate they are involved in. If
you are willing to apologize and completely disavow your association
with known racists and bigots such as David Duke, I might reconsider.

Companies decide that an advertising contract no longer suits their
business needs, whatever those needs may be, all the time. Often they
don't write a press release about it and explain their choices, but
apparently in this case Kellogg's got enough complaints that they felt
this was necessary.
Again, purchases of advertising in the past do not in any way create an
obligation for purchases of advertising in the future.
"Free speech" refers to freedom, not price. You can say what you like,
but don't expect an advertiser to fund it for you if it is hate speech,
conflicts with their company values, or their customers' values. You are
welcome to do what you like, of course; personally I'm inclined to
celebrate the willingness of Kellogg's to take a stand with a bowl of
Frosted Flakes (or maybe Frosted Mini-Wheats, I haven't decided yet).

Dude... I'm not arguing for anything. I'm simply explaining the way
things work in the corporate world, particularly regarding advertising
and the decisions behind it (I worked in marketing for a while and some
would say in a way I still do). I'm not saying I like it or that I'm an
advocate of it. There is a huge difference.

First, why the hell are you running an anonymous FTP server in 2016?!
FTP needs to die... it was designed in an era where it was acceptable to
send passwords across the internet in plain text. That era is long gone.
HTTP (really HTTPS now) for downloads, and SFTP/SCP for the use cases
where HTTP(S) won't really fit.
Second, if I remember right, .scr *is* a type of Windows executable
(originally used for screensavers). Thank Microsoft for that one... most
people wouldn't recognize .scr the way they would, say, .exe, .dll, and
the like. This is why I like the Unix method a lot better: if you want
to run something, you either have to feed it to something like bash or
python on the command line, or give it execute permissions. Of course,
the flip side of this is that mounting stuff over SMB has the executable
bit set on everything, even stuff for which an execute action would not
make any sense... which kind of shoots down this rudimentary security
mechanism. (Again, blame Microsoft, who clearly thinks the existence of
an execute permission bit is redundant.)

I am all for freedom of speech, but a list started for a specific
purpose becomes useless if most, or even many, of the posts are
off-topic. The tor-talk list (which I do not subscribe to) was started
for a specific purpose, and allowing the continued posting of off-topic
garbage defeats the whole purpose of having such a list.
I don't work for the US military or US government, but I support the TOr
Project's and Graham Boyce's efforts to restore order to the list in
principle. Those who have threatened to rejoin the list under other
identities have committed a despicable and reprehensible act and deserve
the ban from the forum they have received. I will admit that sometimes our governments in the US sometimes get it
wrong when passing laws. We as a nation have learned from our mistakes
and the history of the laws reflect this. To infiltrate an e-mail list
originated from private computer systems with off-topic posts, and then
to threaten to continue doing so despite being banned from that list is
against the law in most states and I believe violates Federal law as
well. It is the right of the Tor Project and the people behind it to
refuse to re-publish off-topic messages. To that effect, I support the
Tor Project taking legal action against any such offenders if that
becomes necessary.
Before anyone even asks, my beliefs are the same regardless of whether
or not Jacob Applebaum is guilty of what he has been accused of. (I do
consider it noteworthy that so far such accusations have only been made

Any project like Tor relies on its fair share of volunteers to make
stuff happen. That doesn't necessarily mean those volunteers are on the
government payroll, if anything it would mean quite the opposite. It's
also unnecessarily pejorative to call that "dirty work." I really think
all the majority of the tor-users list readership wants, is an on-topic
list. That's what Mr. Boyce gave them. Their list, their rules. If you
don't like it, start your own list with whatever topic you want.

Standing up for someone's right to pollute the list with messages that,
in all honesty, contribute nothing to civil discussion, is bad enough.
Your suggestion that I unsubscribe is many times worse than that.
Maybe circa 2003-2006 or so, it used to not be like this. At least, I
don't remember it being anywhere near this bad, even when there was the
occasional flaming going on. I've never seen someone spew one attack

Getting banned from a mailing list, in general, should serve as a

He's a dishonest jerk who thinks he is above the law (inciting riots
during the campaign in North Carolina comes to mind). If you check
Politifact he told far more lies during the debates than Hillary. The
parallels to what Hitler promised Germany during the latter's campaign
in the 1930s are also damned frightening.
I really hope Rump (as I call him) changes a lot over the next couple of
months. Someone needs to tell him this is not just a taping of The
Apprentice or some other reality TV show, this whole president thing
*is* REALITY.
I didn't really want to vote for Hillary, but it was the best choice to
help turn Texas blue. If we were successful turning Texas blue, we'd be
talking about president-elect Hillary Clinton right now.
Forgive me if I don't jump with joy that Mister "Grab 'Em By The Pussy"
is going to protect us from rapists. I'll believe it when I see it.
He was endorsed by the KKK and said nothing to distance himself from it.
He said he'd build a wall on the Mexican border and get Mexico to pay
for it (which I think is a bit overkill and not the best use of
resources). He mentioned banning all Muslims from immigrating to the US.

1. The candidate with the most votes takes all the electoral votes in
that state.
2. As a result of  a vote for any candidate who finishes below second
place is effectively the same as voting for the eventual winner. Put
another way, it robs the second place candidate of the votes needed to
So... in Texas, Trump won. That means voting for Gary Johnson was the
same as voting for Trump. Voting for Jill Stein was the same as voting
for Trump. Voting for Evan McMullin was the same as voting for Trump.
If everyone in Texas who had voted just for Gary Johnson had voted for
Hillary instead, we'd be having an entirely different discussion because
Trump would not have won.
I will say this: at least Jill Stein or Evan McMullin couldn't have been
any worse than Trump. But the system as it stands now doesn't even give
them, or others who run outside of the two major parties, a realistic
chance to win the presidency. This sucks, but it is what it is.

Exactly. Sure, technically you can write in anybody and vote for anybody
on the ballot. But the reality is, unless an overwhelming number of
people vote third-party, it's just going to take more votes away from
the second-place candidate and it's effectively a vote for the eventual
winner. Doesn't matter if the votes are for Jill Stein, Gary Johnson,
Evan McMullin, or Mickey Mouse.

It doesn't do what you think it does. It does nothing to break the
system. In Texas, if you voted for Stein, Johnson, McMullin, or Mickey
Mouse... you effectively voted for Trump and made it that much more
difficult to turn Texas blue.

that actually thought Trump would be a good president.

If you're saying Bernie would have slayed it against the Donald in the

campaign did make quite a few mistakes that hurt whatever chance she had.
I wouldn't say "worse than worthless and less than useless" but I am
definitely disappointed in the Democratic party leadership. Of course,
the Republican party proved itself worthless by nominating Trump, who
still got elected despite former presidents urging voters not to vote
for him! Despite being the biggest jerk that I've ever seen a
presidential candidate be. Despite openly violating laws against
inciting a riot (I'm still not sure how he got away with that). Despite
asking "why can't we just nuke Russia?" three times in the span of an

He's a dishonest jerk who thinks he is above the law (inciting riots
during the campaign in North Carolina comes to mind). If you check
Politifact he told far more lies during the debates than Hillary. The
parallels to what Hitler promised Germany during the latter's campaign
in the 1930s are also damned frightening.
I really hope Rump (as I call him) changes a lot over the next couple of
months. Someone needs to tell him this is not just a taping of The
Apprentice or some other reality TV show, this whole president thing
*is* REALITY.
I didn't really want to vote for Hillary, but it was the best choice to
help turn Texas blue. If we were successful turning Texas blue, we'd be
talking about president-elect Hillary Clinton right now.

enough people do it, they go out of business and some of you might even
have a party where you all sing "Ding Dong The Witch Is Dead" etc.
I'm not a huge fan of GoDaddy nor am I a current customer. The reality
is, on GoDaddy's servers, GoDaddy sets the rules (terms of
service/acceptable use policy). That's not shilling, that's just a
simple statement of fact.

Honestly, I think we're overdue for SCOTUS to make some new rulings on
the First Amendment, though I am not sure I want the current SCOTUS to
be the one making those rulings. (We all know Merrick Garland should be
on the bench in place of Gorsuch, or at least should have gotten a
proper "nay" vote.)

I saw something mentioned about 1.3 million IP addresses involved. Well,
as I replied to a posting of this story on Facebook, they can have 1.3
million copies of my middle finger. It's so obvious to me this is
partisan crap from DJT. Say what you will about Hillary, she would have
handled this with far more grace and wouldn't be resorting to such
tactics to silence her critics.
I hope we get Bernie in 2020. To be fair though, we can't possibly elect
anyone much worse than DJT, so voting Democrat will almost certainly be
an improvement over the status quo (assuming we still have DJT then,
hopefully at least DJT will be impeached and Pence will be in).

The move towards 64-bit is not about security, but about the fact that
32-bit hardware is becoming increasingly more rare. My friend's 64-bit
PC has a BIOS copyright date in 2006, and by no means is he usually an
early adopter of new technology; by 2010 if not earlier it was much
easier to get a new system that was 64-bit capable than one that
specifically was not. I decommissioned my last 32-bit PC in 2011, and
the only time I might need the 32-bit version of something is to run it
in a VM on my laptop (it can only do 32-bit VMs, not 64-bit).
For most code which does not actually require a 64-bit processor to run,
it should be possible to compile 32-bit binaries. However we are moving
towards a world where 64-bit is the rule not the exception and 32-bit is
today what 16-bit was in, say, 20 years ago (1997-ish).

Alternatively, how about Viber redesigning their software such that
Alice and Bob can give each other their public keys without Viber
headquarters even having to get involved, if that's what they want? Or,
alternatively, use some other mutually trusted (by both Alice and Bob)
third party server to negotiate the key exchange.
This was poor design by Viber, especially if there's no way for Bob to
verify Alice's key is the same one he has in his Viber client and vice
versa. One has to wonder if it was designed this way by Viber on purpose.
I guess the lesson here is "don't use Viber, use something else".

Unfortunately, as long as you keep using Gmail, it rings hollow. If you

from as many other Google products/services that you possibly can
(YouTube, Blogger, etc). For videos there's Vimeo among others, and for
blogging there's WordPress.com (or the self-hosted version of WordPress)
among others.
There's also DuckDuckGo for most searches if you want to start giving

What I'm getting at is the only real way to get Google's attention is
for people (like you) to stop using their services. For as long as I
could I avoided even emailing Gmail address until it just became
impossible to avoid.
As an aside I wish there was an alternative to Android that was truly
free (as in freedom). Android is the least of the three (remaining)
evils, but having the three choices whittled down to Apple, Microsoft,
or Google is enough to make me sick at my stomach when I really think
about it. The lack of decent apps available as free software (as in
freedom, as in GPL/MIT/BSD license) is also a huge disappointment, on
top of the gymnastics required to compile and install from source (it's
so obvious they intend for almost nobody to do so).

What I'm getting at is the only real way to get Google's attention is
for people (like you) to stop using their services. For as long as I
could I avoided even emailing Gmail address until it just became
impossible to avoid.
As an aside I wish there was an alternative to Android that was truly
free (as in freedom). Android is the least of the three (remaining)
evils, but having the three choices whittled down to Apple, Microsoft,
or Google is enough to make me sick at my stomach when I really think
about it. The lack of decent apps available as free software (as in
freedom, as in GPL/MIT/BSD license) is also a huge disappointment, on
top of the gymnastics required to compile and install from source (it's
so obvious they intend for almost nobody to do so).

FYI, version 0.2 just came out, and adds quite a few features from 0.1
(unfortunately it is not backward compatible with 0.1). From my
experience, you will need Go 1.7 to compile it as a feature specific to
that version and later is now used.

If you're in the US, call your Representative and Senators, especially

impeached. If they actually do their damn jobs, the probable cause for
an impeachment is damn near staring them in the face.

The nice thing about free software is anyone can add those features, or
pay for them to be added. So even your non-government or non-US

The features you mention don't even break compatibility with the rest of

So strictly speaking, I was a bit off the mark. However, I think neither
the OTF nor the NSF are able to exert the kind of pressure that was asserting to be the reason that there is no chaff-filled network
feature in Tor.

Right. In other words, it's not laundered NSA money to put a subtle

The "free market" is what is wrong with "health care" in the US.
For-profit hospitals have to make money, so they charge outrageous
prices. For-profit "health insurance" companies want to make money, so
they negotiate the best deals with hospitals. If you don't have health
insurance, you don't get the rate charged to the insurance companies,
you get a much higher rate. There is no limit to what a for-profit
hospital can charge, especially for ER (what we call A&E) visits.
I am not the first to say this: the US has among the best medical care
in the world, if you can afford it. And the last five words in that
statement are the problem.
The ACA (Obamacare) wasn't perfect, but it was the first step towards
fixing a broken system: 80% of premiums had to go towards paying for
care, and pre-existing condition exclusions were no longer allowed
(since if you look hard enough, almost everyone has a pre-existing
condition somewhere). If Mitt Romney was elected and they called it
Romneycare, the Republicans would praise it and praise Mittens like he
was the greatest president since George Washington. Is it any
coincidence that they didn't? (Hint: look at pictures of Mittens and Obama.)

$500+ for six ounces of saline solution is outrageous by any reasonable
standard. Compared to that, even $10 for a six-inch hotdog in some
places might not be too bad of a deal, though personally I'm unlikely to
pay more than about $5-6 on an actual street corner. (Sidenote: On my
last visit to James Coney Island here in Houston, two Texas style hot
dogs and a large Coke came out to $10.79, which I don't consider

The difference, though, is you usually can compare prices of hot dog
street vendors before deciding where to have your lunch. If you have a
heart attack, there's no shopping around for the cheapest ER. This is
where the "free market" fails; under a "free market" that heart attack
could easily bankrupt you if you are a self-pay customer.
I believe medical care is a human right. We've failed at that in the US
because even though there exists a nominal public-funded health care
system, it's vastly lower quality compared to what even moderately
well-off people get.

And now that I look again, LoC is probably a better system for this
purpose, if for the only reason the Dewey system is supposed to be
licensed by libraries using it.
Yes, it's weird to group geography, anthropology, and recreation under
one main category, but I'm not sure there's a better place for it under
the other broad categories. It's much the same problem as the
shortcomings of the original Encyclopedia of Chess Openings scheme of
classifying chess openings has started to show its limitations, with a
lot of codes being devoted to openings no longer played and a lot of
lines of common openings being stuck under the exact same code. Thus the
reason for the unofficial "Scid extensions" etc.
If neither LoC nor (a bootleg use of) Dewey fit your needs, there's
always the option of rolling your own.

@_subject: What is a secure computer? 
Because Tor requires a properly set clock, especially for hidden
services. HTTPS also requires a properly set clock to validate certificates.
If you start Tails and tell it not to connect to the network at all, I
don't think it tries to set the clock. Almost everything Tails does with
networking goes over Tor, so if Tor is broken on Tails, networking is
broken. (If it sets the clock over NTP, that doesn't, but it's no more
incriminating than anyone else's use of NTP.)
Okay, why does everything use HTTP/HTTPS if it possibly can?
Because there are so many birdbrained administrators that block just
about every other protocol. You'd think they think the Internet is only
ports 80 and 443.
Not that long ago, I was on a hospital's public wifi and I could not
even connect to my PC back home on SSH port 22, much less over OpenVPN
or even Iodine (IP tunneling over DNS requests). Now, OpenVPN and SSH
work from the Starbucks locations around me... for now. In the future I
may have to tunnel those over HTTPS as well. I shouldn't have to; you're
right. But blame the birdbrained network admins that block everything else.

I'm not a fascist. I do think the length of copyright restrictions have

every damned time the original Mickey Mouse is about to enter public
domain). From Wikipedia:
However, I don't have a problem the general concept of copyright; my
problems are with the obscenely long terms that Hollywood has bought and
paid for, that have effectively killed the public domain.
Copyright pre-dates WWII and Nazi Germany by centuries, and the US by at
least decades, originating in 1709 with the Statute of Anne in England.
It is not, by any means, an American invention. Given that it predates
Hitler by centuries, calling it a "Nazi" law is at best unintentionally
misleading, and at worst outright wrong.

I agree with the other examples you cited, but I would not call illegal
(re-)immigration a victimless crime in all circumstances. I agree our
immigration laws are broken as currently written and enforced; however,
dealing with illegal aliens takes resources away from the rest of us,
especially given that they often do not pay the appropriate amount of
taxes back into the system compared to someone here legally.

The campaign is still ongoing. Maybe we have lost in the case of the
vast majority of marketing/advertising lists, but Thunderbird and other
email clients (thankfully) offer the option to not automatically load
external links by default.
I do think a future version (actually, the next version) of Thunderbird
and/or Enigmail need to put up a big huge "danger" warning when they
detect HTML email mixed with encrypted content, especially when it looks
like someone has tried to put an encrypted blob as the destination of a

good reason to do this, and plenty of bad reasons.

This is a new thread for civil discussion about the deletion of the
Nicolás Morás article from Spanish-language Wikipedia.
I will start this by including an automatically translated version of
the discussion page (the online translator I'm using has a 5000
character limit so this took a couple of go-rounds). I originally wasn't
going to do this. I did omit a portion that appears to be from a known
sockpuppet ("CPP") and which was left on the page in strikethrough. If
you don't care for all this skip to the end and/or search for the other
string of three dashes on a line by itself I have used to delineate the
translated portion.
("Remove yourself" is apparently how "delete" was translated and "keep
yourself" is how "keep" or "don't delete" was translated at least some
of the time. Other acronyms appear to be specific to the
Spanish-language version of Wikipedia and did not translate.)
The following discussion is an archived deletion query. Please, do not
modify it. The following comments should be made on the appropriate
discussion page (the article discussion or in a restoration
consultation). No further edits should be made on this page.
The result was Delete. Aleposta (discussion) 00:39 13 Jun 2019 (UTC)

    Keep yourself Stay - I think the article as it is meets all the
requirements to stay. The content is encyclopedically relevant. The
knowledge of the biography is due to his career as a journalist and
political activist and not to factors other than his abilities,
sensationalism or heart programs. It is not about self-promotion, it is
a notable public person for more than a single event, which is clear
from the diverse and solid sources. I do not observe unsupported content
or use of wikipedia as a primary source. In addition, other solid
sources can be found on the web coinciding with those already listed.
The current wording is accurate, precise and neutral. It complies with
everything established for Wikipedia: Encyclopedic relevance and

delete Bórrese The character is irrelevant. The article seems to seek to
promote it. None of the sources is reliable, or are blogs or promotional
pages or are not independent sources of the biography, for example,
links to YouTube videos created by him or related people to promote
their ideas. References to the Indymedia forum, Webzine blog or social
networks have no value for Wikipedia. The only sources that could be
independent lead us to links that do not exist or can not be accessed
(for example, I wanted to enter the link to Infobae, which is a known
medium and which is accessed without payment and I am told that can
access because they ask me to pay and "it is possible that the attackers
are trying to steal your information (for example, passwords, messages
or credit cards)" which I suspect are links to malicious sites. I did
not even name the biographer, that is, they are misleading, other
sources refer to unreliable sites, such as this Kontrainfo reference
(and since we are, we should add Wikipedia to that list of sinister
sites "supported by the Open Society Foundation" and that it is a great
donor of those who sustain our work.) This source is reliable but the
only thing about it is that it appears on the list of signatories, this
reference could be used to an article about the group "Libertad &
Equidad" but not for his biography since he does not tell us anything
about its relevance. I want to say that anyone can sign something. I
also tried to enter the references that put to HispanTV but it appeared
to me that «It was not possible to find the IP address of the server».
In short, many references but most misleading, not found, unreliable or
not named. Unknown character in my country that probably seeks to
promote. Career without encyclopedic relevance. Does not comply with the
established in Wikipedia: Encyclopedic relevance. --Jalu (discussion)

why the remark that the Open Society Foundation is a "great donor" of
Wikipedia? I think it has no relevance in this debate if the article in
question speaks well or badly of Open Society, nor should it be
understood that it is better not to speak badly of said foundation just
because it provides donations to the page. It's the only thing that
stands out from your comment, the rest seems to me to be in line with
the debate. Martin Xicarts (discussion) 13:39 3 June 2019 (UTC)

    Comment Comment for the librarian who is going to close the query.
LefontQ (disc. · Contr.) Is a CPP created to exclusively edit articles
related to Nicolás Morás. From 2016 until the start date of this
consultation. He had bleached his diff discussion so he would not see
the different ads he received for promotional since he created the
article. All his interventions in the TAB were to defend this article,
and avoid its deletion, for example diff. Godivaciones (disc. · Contr.),
On the other hand, is an account created after starting this query, CPP
whose sole purpose seems to be that this article is not deleted. He has
dedicated himself to proselytizing, de-legitimizing this consultation,
inviting him to support:

    Vitor
    Waka Waka
    Marcomogollon
    Arkangel414
    Verent

It is very striking that, in all these invitations, he has forgotten to
tell Hades7 (disc. · Contr.), Who had been opining about the lack of
relevance of this biography, diff and who is the one who placed the
template without relevance , diff. --Jalu (discussion) 17:43 6 Jun 2019

intolerable. Just kidding. But well ... it smells like spam and the
character does not stand out for its tremendous importance. Maybe later,
with accounts less involved, going to the point, sneaking less trash and
with a more sincere interest ... He has a lot of life ahead of Nicolás
Morás, there is no hurry to create an article. strakhov (discussion)

    Keep yourself Stay really I do not see that the article has any
self-promotion dyes, at any time I appreciate it. Regarding relevance,
which is apparently the main problem here, I see that most of the
sources used belong to media without any affiliation with the subject.
When searching the web I find a lot of information about Morás, so I
assume that media notoriety has. Likewise, its association with media
such as Hispan TV and Telesur confirm my idea of ​​its relevance.
Therefore, I think that the article should be maintained, also
appreciating the improvements that have been made in recent
days.Darthvader2 (discussion) 05:03 11 Jun 2019 (UTC)
    Keep yourself Stay - As other users said, I do not see
self-promotion in the article (although certain paragraphs should be
rewritten). There are sources and references in different parts of the
article and I do not think that it seeks to generate controversy; in
fact, it has a section where the "controversies" are mentioned.
I do not see the difference between this article and that of, for
example, Baby Etchecopar or Javier Milei, who also have controversies.
Now, if we go with respect to relevance, I do not see why they consider
that it does not have; the fact of being a journalist from the Argentine
south does not make it less important than those of the Federal Capital.
In fact, if we follow the line of relevance, in Wikipedia there are
articles by less relevant people such as Charlotte Caniggia
 or Barbara Vélez
 B% C3% A1rbara_V% C3% A9lez that are not
just very relevant people, but "children of" other celebrities.
In short, none of the arguments that are used to delete the article
seems valid: 1. the article does not seem self-promoting because it also
talks about disputes. 2. I do not think it is very relevant, since
Wikipedia has articles from less relevant people (like the ones I
mentioned above), added to the fact that I believe that the person is
discredited a little because it is not Capital. 3. I DO NOT see that it
breaks rules, since it contains sources and references. For all this, I
vow to keep the article. DMAC89 (discussion) 18:08 June 11 2019 (UTC)

see that you have 108 contributions in the main space of Wikipedia and
since 2015 that you do not edit. How did you appear 4 years later and
you entered directly to this opinion to give your opinion? You do not
even know how to make an internal link to Charlotte Caniggia or Baby
Etchecopar or Javier Milei. Also, what do the articles by Baby
Etchecopar or Javier Milei have to do with it? How is the person being
discredited because he or she is not a Capital? Who said that being a
journalist from the Argentine south is less important than the ones from
the Federal Capital? and, fundamentally, how do you know that it is from
the south if the article does not say it? --Jalu (discussion) 18:23 11

    I was observing the debate about maintaining or not maintaining this
article, although some find errors in the links area for example, I will
also deny link 10 because it is found to be in a private browsing.
Perform a research on Nicolás Morás and showed results of interviews
conducted on his personal opinion on the political situation of the
country, and publication in independent newspapers and regional scope.
Also watch a total of 37 videos of him offering interviews and debates
on television and universities. Being an audiovisual source, it bases
the validity of this article.
    Some users have commented on the topic of what is a more
self-referential article perhaps it would be good if the article is
re-edited and detected those links that will really have to be deleted
because they do not have direct access.
    He is an independent journalist who is venturing into activities of
his profession, every young journalist begins working with independent
journalism and is something that should not be underestimated. That is
why I share with DMAC89 his perspective of point two where he explains
that anyone has an article in a wikipedia and that these characters are
not very relevant. I observed that it is part of the "Civic Freedom and
Equity Movement" this is proven in the work with respectable characters
in the area of ​​culture and thinkers. - The previous unsigned comment
is the work of Florencia Cayuela (disc. • contribs). 23:11 11 Jun 2019
(UTC) -Florencia Cayuela (discussion • contributions) has made few or no
edition in other articles.
Keep greetings, I do not intend to argue, but I want to reason my vote:
I find it reasonable that the publication of the article may lead to the
conclusion that it is self-promotional because of the way it was
initially published and the way in which some users have intervened.
However on the other hand the way in which it is judged so that it is
discarded, so fervently in some cases, could also lead to think that
there is this type of motivations but in the other sense. Even more
after seeing the surprising argumentation in relation to the OSF of Mr.
Soros that although it was noticed as irrelevant by another user
immediately, but I think it has enough relevance that without any blush
it is said that the donations of the OSF have some impact in the
publication, discarding or deletion of an article in the Wikipedia
according to the interests of this foundation according to the donations
made to Wikipedia "because it is a great donor of those who support our
work." Let's put the case upside down. Let's say that Mr. Morás makes a
significant contribution to the Wikipedia cause. Would this be a
determining factor to be considered relevant and articles related to it
would be relevant? Skinny favor to our "free" encyclopedia. This calls
me a lot of attention, because those who argued that the article was
rejected rejected not only refute (which I applaud) but they went
directly to suspect (which I do not applaud) the opinion of the other
participants because of its recent incorporation or lack of activity,
when it was enough to counteract them (as some have done) and when
Wikipedia has as a principle the presumption of good faith and it would
not be desirable for some editor or librarian to begin to point out the
detractors of this page due to suspicions of act pro NGO, without some
evidence. So we find an ad hominem argument that can come back as a
boomerang on anyone. In this query the vehemence of the accusations,
some argument lazy, etc. Everything can be used as a pretext to erase or
incorporate the article, if we start pointing at each other. Undoubtedly
throughout Latin America there are less relevant characters and
situations that have overcome deletion queries or that have not even
gone through this filter. And the only doubt that this article sends to
consultation, tells me that it was not subject to quick deletion for
something. In my opinion Mr. Morás has some relevance, not the greatest,
nor the best, but some notoriety has reached with his journalistic work
revealing financing schemes to politicians of various tendencies,
reading about this was that I found about him. I invite you to leave
arguments ad hominem aside and polish Wikipedia, including this article.

    remove yourself. What beautiful and ethical speeches from the users
who come here to defend the indefensible. Self-promotion, lack of
neutrality, accounts with a particular purpose, references sought with a
magnifying glass, what else do we want? It would be good if they really
edited something acceptable in an encyclopaedia and that they did not
ride on the podium of political speeches. And to know thoroughly what is
Wikipedia, so they would know that the free word is nothing but a bad
translation that we drag from remote times. It is free because you do
not have to pay a dime to consult it, copy it, etc. But the freedom of
opinion within the texts of the articles does not exist here, it is very
much against the neutrality that we demand. Lourdes, messages here 13:43

remove yourself. It has no relevance. Also, I see that there is a
certain distortion. The references do not say what the article says. For
example: Liberty and Equity is not a "movement," as the entradilla
states, but a "platform," as the biography defines (ref 37). -

    Keep yourself Stay Good afternoon, in my opinion thanks to the
editions that have been made in the last month, the article no longer
has any statement as a primary source. I do not see that it has a lack
of neutrality or that it is of a promotional nature.
About the sources, I agree that they are quite, however, mostly medium
and large media and the links I reviewed work well. I think Morás's
journalistic activity is a relevant article in Wikipedia terms and
therefore it should be kept on the platform. This without rejecting the
idea of ​​improving it, which would be a separate question. Angela.O

    stay Stay Stay I can not comment on the relevance of an article
referring to a political activist. We can not ignore that questioning
the relevance of these social actors is not innocent. It is a dialelo
that we should write "relevant" articles based only on what the mass
media reports. The shortage of articles and that these are neutral are
anathema to this free encyclopedia. Our task is to offer users
information about people that even in our opinion may seem irrelevant.
We all know that correcting political articles is a difficult, sensitive
task in which the quality of information is especially tested. This
information may be relevant for some users who are in favor or even
against this alleged character. If the alleged character is irrelevant,
no one will enter this article or anyone will read it. For this reason I
am opposed to deletion. In my opinion, article should be totally
restructured and summarized. The format should not suggest political
propaganda as it is currently. The article should provide sufficient and
neutral information to understand who this activist is and what he
thinks. HANNAN Orange color.jpg23: 47 12 Jun 2019 (UTC)

Comment Comment I have my doubts. On the one hand, the character, in
itself, seems relevant to me (even if he is a controversialist rather
than an intellectual); However, I am worried about this wave of users
who came to defend this article, because more than a spontaneous
reaction, it seems to be a recruitment other than Wikipedia. I do not
have much evidence, but in places like Workana and Freelancer (I see
that it was mentioned before) they have been calling people to answer in
erasure queries. Therefore, I am inclined to think that the article is
self-promotional. --Luis Alvaz (discussion) 23:55 Jun 12 2019 (UTC)
     The previous discussion is kept as a record of the debate. Please,
do not modify it. This page should not be edited anymore.
What I gather from this discussion (given the half-assed and partially
mangled English typical of automatic translation in the late 2010s), is
that the article appears to have been deleted because it appeared to be
more self-promotional than encyclopedic. I don't think feminism or other
political ideology entered into it (what Jalu appears to be saying in
what was translated as "the character is irrelevant"). That someone
would assume radical feminism is behind such a decision is something I
find rather sad.
As nominally off-topic as this may be, I wouldn't mind discussing this
further here. However, I would ask that in this thread, we have no
personal attacks and use neutral terms to refer to the parties involved,
in particular avoiding the use of slurs such as one perpetuated by a
certain conservative US talk show host. Let's keep the debate in this
thread rubbish-free and focus on the facts and the issues, not personal

RAM + 8GiB swap if that is an option. However, modern operating systems
are designed to swap out out certain things to make the best use of all

RAM upgrade going this route. It may be, however, that your usage

Q: How does account self-destruction work?
Telegram is not a commercial organization, and we value our disk space

six months, your account will be deleted along with all messages, media,
contacts and every other piece of data you store in the Telegram cloud.
You can change the exact period after which your inactive account will
self-destruct in Settings.

If you can spare the extra overhead to run a crypto filesystem, yes, do
that. (On systems as old as my current laptop, it's barely a workable
option, and I did notice better performance when I went back to an
unencrypted filesystem. Then again, my threat model was strictly
protecting against my laptop getting stolen when out and about, less of
a concern now especially with the COVID-19 pandemic limiting the need to
take it out of the hose.) However it still can't hurt to wipe deleted
files and free space as a matter of routine privacy protection.
However, do be aware of things like encrypted filesystems complicating
data recovery in the event of software/hardware failure. Sure, maybe the
cops can't get your data, but it can bite you in the ass when Shit

@_subject: Any Cypherpunk there ? 
I'm still scratching my head wondering what  flagrant racism,
antisemitism, etc have to do with the cypherpunk movement and/or
securing technology through encryption. Just kidding... they don't,  but
apparently since a certain other list is moderated (or if you'd believe
some people, "censored"), all that stuff just gets posted here. I've
even seen this list cc'd or even threads outright redirected here when
it wouldn't pass muster on the other list. Yes, that list is a
"technical" list, and I'm not saying this list should become a carbon
copy of it, but this is what I'm talking about regarding topic drift.
I support the original mission of the cypherpunks movement. As stated in
the Wikipedia article:
There are times and places where one must protect themselves from
security risks wearing blue and carrying badges and guns as much as the
ones wearing black and balaclavas, or whatever disguise garb criminals
wear these days. In a perfect world the cops could be trusted to obey
the same laws they are supposed to be enforcing and living up to the
standard of "'s finest" as they are often called. We,
unfortunately, do not live in anything close to a perfect world.
The way it's looking though, regularly slinging antisemitic, racist, and
other slurs, and sticking up for the right to spew outright bullshit
where it's not wanted, appear to be someone's idea of de facto
qualifications to be a "true cypherpunk". I refuse to do either; I see
the ideal form of the cypherpunk movement as egalitarian, where those of
all ethnicities and backgrounds are treated equally and given the same
chance to participate in beneficial social and political change. Yes,
this specifically includes Jews and people of color, as well as LGBTQ+
populations and other marginalized groups.
Honestly, if you're going to shut out some people, or use exclusionary
language such as well-recognized slurs that are avoided by people who
use the word "fuck" like they would use salt and pepper on bland food,
then you're no better than the authorities you pretend to hate. United

I don't get it. Why even the mention of what religion they are? What the
hell does being Jewish have to do with anything, except for possible
justification of anti-Semitic slurs when correlated with (perceived) wealth?

What specific crimes have they committed, and what courts of law have
adjudicated these crimes?
That is false, I merely asked a question. I'm not shilling for anyone.

To everyone:
There are good and bad people of every religion/world view, nationality,
skin color, gender identity, and income level. Labeling an entire
nationality or religion as criminals only serves to divide humanity, not
unite it. Labeling anyone as criminals, when they haven't actually
committed a crime under existing laws, comes dangerously close to
slander/libel, if not right smack over the line.
I will admit many of our legal/judicial systems aren't perfect, but
conspiracy theories like this aren't helping.
I'm also trying to figure out what relevance this has toward the
cypherpunk movement as I see it.

False, I have never worked for the US Government. I have never received
any monetary compensation as wages to work for the US Government, nor
have I received any other non-cash consideration to work for the US
Government. I have stated this on the list in the past.
False, I am not Jewish. False, I am not a fascist.
I have not ignored this, it just has not been relevant to anything
regarding the cypherpunks movement.
I am in favor of a two-state solution to the long-running
Israel-Palestine conflict. To say the least, I think it is unfortunate
the conflict has raged on this long. I prefer peace to war; the harsh
reality, though, is fewer people make money off of peace than war.
Also, Jewish Nazis seems to be self-contradictory, last I checked it was
the German Nazi party that committed the atrocity of killing millions of
(Jewish) people.
Not that this has any relevance to the nominal topic of the list, but I
cannot let obvious lies go unchallenged.

I disagree with all three of these. Religion and government should be
separate, especially in the US where the Constitution specifically says
so. In general theocracies are problematic for world peace (which I'd
like to see happen in my lifetime). Of course, some corporations
(military contractors) profit more off of war than peace...

Just kidding... I've been involved with anti-spam efforts for a while so
I know false positives do happen. We have made progress since the
Wallace/C&S era but yet some things never change.

On 9/1/20 03:08, the following dropped into my email box via the
cypherpunks list:
The link via banned.video works if you access it via infowars.com, and
of course there's always setting sail for The Pirate Bay (*cough*
*cough cough*. Decentralized BitTorrent, even if lacking in the
anonymity protection department, is surprisingly censorship resistant if
enough people seed a given torrent. I've tried to seed it, but no takers
so far. It's just under a gigabyte, admittedly not that much space in an
era in which 32GB thumb drives can be had for under US$5 if you know
where to look, so something I'll keep around for a while in case anyone
wants it, and to laugh at in 10 years when it's patently obvious it's
the load of bovine excrement it's been made out to be.
As far as due diligence, I tend to trust USA Today and Politifact over
sources with a questionable track record of neutrality. Evaluating the
sum total of what known reliable sources have to say about a given
documentary film (or other item) *is* my due diligence.

Personally, I swear by Micro Center branded devices, they seem to be
quite reliable for the price point. Not too long ago I rolled the dice
with some no-name 16 GB disks from Amazon (at about the same price point
as Micro Center's media) I was intending to use as boot media, and other
than being rather slow even for USB 2.0 and identifying as "VendorCo
ProductCode" they are decent.
I'm hearing modern DVD+R/DVD-R media can be a bit more finicky, though,
particularly the dual layer variants.

The US elections are serious business this time around; there's even
more riding on them than there was in 2016. Not just for the US, but for
the world. As a US citizen, I don't particularly like that our country
has such a strong influence on the rest of the world, but it is what it is.
It still boggles my mind that someone denied a casino license in Nevada
still managed, somehow, to not only win a major party nomination but the
 general election as well.
