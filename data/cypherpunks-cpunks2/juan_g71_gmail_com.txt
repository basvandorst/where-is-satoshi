Seems to me that it's rather easy for terrorists to create simple
hardware for at least secure text messaging (or more). The recipe goes something like this :
1) a microcontroller.
2) a keyboard 3) an 'old' lcd text display
4) eeprom memory - sd card
5) a bunch of discrete components for a noise generator.
The idea is to mix all those ingredients plus code to get a system that
can 1) generate random data to be used as key in 'one time pad' encryption
2) input text messages (and encrypt them of course)
3) decrypt text messages to the screen
(if the microcontroller can act as an usb host it maybe possible to get
data from devices like cameras and encrypt it)
The thing is, distribution of the key material should be trivial for
any 'terrist' worth his salt.  So the only drawback of the allegedly
secure one time pad isn't really an issue. I'm guessing that any real 'spies' out there have been using something
like this for a while.

...what's the deal? Is it a scam? "David Irvine began work on MaidSafe in 2006. He raised $5 million for
the project" april 2014  "It raised over $7 million in Mastercoins and Bitcoins." They've been working on it for almost 10 years and still...nothing?

@_subject: One Laptop Per Terrorist 
Seems to me that it's rather easy for terrorists to create simple
hardware for at least secure text messaging (or more). The recipe goes something like this :
1) a microcontroller.
2) a keyboard 3) an 'old' lcd text display
4) eeprom memory - sd card
5) a bunch of discrete components for a noise generator.
The idea is to mix all those ingredients plus code to get a system that
can 1) generate random data to be used as key in 'one time pad' encryption
2) input text messages (and encrypt them of course)
3) decrypt text messages to the screen
(if the microcontroller can act as an usb host it maybe possible to get
data from devices like cameras and encrypt it)
The thing is, distribution of the key material should be trivial for
any 'terrist' worth his salt.  So the only drawback of the allegedly
secure one time pad isn't really an issue. I'm guessing that any real 'spies' out there have been using something
like this for a while.

A couple of people have sent me pinging messages, asking about my
status on the Cypherpunks list....apparently it has taken several weeks
for folks to notice my absence! :-}  This may speak volumes about why I
have left the list, and what the list has become.....
I chose not to write a "departing flame" (or message, but some might
call it a flame) when I unsubscribed several weeks ago--within an hour
of reading that John and Sandy had decided to make "their" list a
moderated list, by the way--as I saw little benefit. I was also fed up
with things, and saw no point in wasting even more of my time arguing
against the New Cypherpunks World Order, as the NCWO was clearly
presented as a fait accompli, not something ablut which opinions of
list members (or even list _founders_, at least not me) were being
sought. It's my nature to just say "Fuck it" and leave when I feel I
have overstayed my time, or things are no longer fun, or I am made to
feel unwelcome.
But since several people have pinged me, asking about my status, I'll
take some time to say a few things. I've had access to the hks.net
archive site, and/or the Singapore site, to occasionally see what was
being said on the list (old habits die slowly, so I sometimes drop in
to see what you people are flaming each other about...not
surprisingly--in fact utterly predictably--I see vast amounts of
bandwidth consumed by arguments about moderation, about the putative
biases of the Moderator and Director of the New Cypherpunks World
Order, about alternative moderation strategies (which is stupid, as
John and Sandy announced what they were going to do, not just some of
their preliminary thoughts), and so on. I've also noticed fewer
substantive essays. With no false modesty I tried awfully hard to
compose substantive essays on crypto-political topics, often more than
one per day. (Others did too, but they seem to be tapering off as well,
leaving the list to be dominated by something called a "Toto," the
"O.J. was framed!" ravings of Dale Thorn, the love letters between
Vulis and someone name Nurdane Oksas, and the occasional bit of crypto
news. Ho hum. I'm glad I'm not reading the list in e-mail, and thus can
easily avoid replying to these inanities...which would probably not be
approved for reading by Sandy, so why bother anyway?)
Rather than compose a traditional essay, I'll take the  easy way out and
list some bulleted points.
* First, I don't argue that John Gilmore is unfree to do as he wishes
  with his machine, toad, which has been the major machine host for the
Cypherpunks list. John can tell us we have to write in Pig Latin if he
wishes. Much of the debate I saw in the archives was debate that missed
  the point about what John could and couldn't do. No one can seriously
  question the right of the owner of a machine, or the owner of a
  restaurant, etc., to set the policies he wishes. The owner of a
  restaurant is perfectly free--or used to be, and still is to anyone
  with even slightly libertarian or freedom tendencies--to set the
  rules of his "house." He may insist that shirts and shoes be worn, or
  that smoking is not allowed (or even is required, in theory), etc. He
  may say "All those eating in my restaurant must wear funny hats and
  have their costumes approved by Sandy Sandfort." This is
  unexceptionable.
* However, anyone who disputes these rules (disputes in the sense of
disliking or disagreeing with them, not legally challenging them) is
  free to leave. Those who don't like crowded, noisy, smoke-filled
  sports bars are encourgaged to leave. And so on. Again,
  unexceptionable.
(The more complicated case of contracts, verbal or written, and
"changing the rules," does not apply here. No one had a contract with
John, or Sandy, or Hugh, etc., so this is not germane.)
* But the really important issue is this: is the _physical hosting_ of
  the Cypherpunks mailing list coterminous with the "Cypherpunks"? If
  the list was hosted by, say, UC Berkeley or PGP Incorporated, would
  we consider these hosts to be the "owners" of the Cypherpunks group?
  Would we think that a corporate host, say, would have the authority
  to direct what we could say on the list? (Again, not disputing their
  corporate property rights...as a libertarian, I cannot. Other issues
  are what I'm getting at.)
* If a Boy Scout troop meets at a local church, and has for several
  years, continuously, would we consider the church to be the owner of
  the troop? Could the church insist on avoidance of certain "cuss
  words" and demand that prayers be said before each gathering?
  Certainly the church could tell the troop what policies were to be
  followed if the the facilities were to be used, etc., and the troop
  could leave if it didn't like the terms (or, in parallel with my
  situation, any troop member could choose to leave....). This is what
  we mean by "property rights": the legal right of a property owner to
  do with his property as he wishes, modulo prior contractual
  relationships, criminal laws, etc.
* How did the mailing list for the group, now called Cypherpunks, get
started, and how did it end up being run off of John's hardare? Hugh
  Daniel got the actual mailing list rolling, based on a discussion
  Eric Hughes, Hugh, and I had the day after the first physical
  meeting, in September 1992. We thought the group we had just spent
  the day with ought to be able to stay in touch, and that a mailing
  list was the right way to go. There was talk of siting it on the UC
  Berkeley computers (actually, the Undergraduate Association
  computers, a la the Cypherpunks archive site at "csua"), but Hugh
  thought he might be able to use "toad," and this is what happened. (I
  have not heard from Hugh on his views of this New and Moderated
  Non-Anarchic List.)
* I think we should all be very grateful to John for agreeing to let it
  run on his hardware, but not let our gratitude turn into some sort of
subservience and blather about how John "owns" the Cypherpunks group.
* Again, is the "Cyherpunks community" the same as the mailing list?
  And is the mailing list, hosted at toad, the "property" of John
  Gilmore?
* In my view, neither John nor Sandy in any sense "own" our group. It
  is a virtual community which sometimes has physical meetings at
  various places (including corporations, restaurants, and bookstores,
  none of which are even partial "owners" of the group) and which has
  had several instantiations on the Net, including sub-lists not
  connected to toad.com in any way. While John is of course free at any
  time to suspend his hosting of the list, I think it a serious
  misapprehension of the basic nature of virtual communities to accept
  the claim that John should decide on what is appropriate to bear the
  "Cypherpunks" list imprimatur and what is to be consigned to the
  flame list.
* The mechanics of the announcement troubled me greatly. To be blunt, I
  was seething with anger. I was mightily annoyed to read that John had
  made a decision to appoint Sandy as his Moderator, with no discussion
  on the list. I don't know if Eric Hughes and Hugh Daniel were asked
  their opinions, but I certainly know I was not. I feel that as one of
  the two or three founders, depending on how one is counting, and as a
  frequent contributor to the list since its inception, and so on, I
  (and others) should at least have been told of this plan. Better yet,
  have the plans discussed on the list, as some good ideas may have
  been generated.
I'll have more to say about my problems with how things were handled.
Frankly, it smacked of the same kind of fait accompli decision John made
with the unsubscribing of Vulis. While John had (and has) every legal
right to do with his property as he wished, the effect was very
negative. First, Vulis found other ways to post (duh). Second, the list
was consumed with flames about this, many from Vulis, and many from
others. Third, journalists (who love sizzle over substance any day of
the week) lept into the fray with articles which gave Vulis the
publicity he craved. Fourth, it sent a message to enemies of liberty
that "Even the Cypherpunks have found it necessary to abandon their
anarchic ways."
(I'm well aware of the issues with pests like Vulis, who seek to destroy
virtual communities like ours. But the solution John used did not work,
and generated more crap. As you all should know, it was John himself
who coined the wonderful saying, "The Net interprets censorship as
damage and routes around it." A delicious irony.)
* In the archives, I did see a bunch of "I support Sandy" and "John is
  our leader" comments from reasonable people. The obvious noise of
  Vulis and his cohorts like Aga made a "Do something!" attitude
  somewhat understandable. I don't think the decision made was a wise
  one, and I strongly doubt it will work to make the list a better one.
* The proper solution to bad speech is more speech, not censorship.
Censorship just makes opponents of "speech anarchy" happy--it affirms
  their basic belief that censors are needed.
* "Censorship" is another overloaded term. I don't think the
  "Definition 1" of dictionary definitions, about _governmental_
  restrictions, is the only meaningful definition. Everybody knows what
  it meant when we say that "Lockheed is censoring the views of
  employees," even though we know Lockheed is not using government
  power. A censor is one who censors. And even my "American Heritage
  Dictionary" gives this as its "definition 1":
"censor n. 1. A person authorized to examine books, films, or other
material and to remove or suppress morally, politically, or otherwise
(Other dictionaries of course give similar definitions. The notion that
censors are confined to being government employees is a misconception.)
* OK, even given that John had decided to censor "his" list, what about
  his choice of Sandy Sandfort as the censor? I've known Sandy for
  several years (I was the one who invited him to the second
  Cypherpunks meeting), but he's a poor choice as a censor, moderator,
  whatever. First, because he has so often gotten involved in
  protracted flame wars, such as with Vulis (remember the dozens of
  messages about the "bet" to bring Vulis out? I stayed out of the
  charade completely.), with Hallam-Baker, and with others. Second,
  because he has not been actively composing essays for a while,
  perhaps because of his job with Community Connexion. Other reasons,
  too.
(I count Sandy as a friend, but I'm just being honest here. Sandy is
just not a "Peter Neumann" (moderator of the "RISKS" list).
* Nor do the announced criteria make any sense. While the inane one-line
scatological insults have been filtered out, many "flames" make it
  through, based on what I've seen in perusing the hks archive site.
  And some reasonable comments get dumped in the flame bucket.
* As expected, those who only want to talk about cryptography (but who
rarely do, themselves, also as expected) waste bandwidth saying the
"anarchist" and "libertarian" stuff ought to go in to the "rejected"
  list. More bandwidth wasted, as each group lobbies to have its
  ideological opponents censored by Sandy.
* I would have had no problem had John announced that he was creating a
  new list, the "Good Stuff" list, with Sandy has his Chooser of Good
  Stuff. After all, both Eric Blossom and Ray Arachelian already offer
  just such lists, and more would not hurt.
But by making the _main list_ the censored one, this skewed things
* (Frankly, one of my considerations in leaving was the feeling that I
would never know if an essay I'd spent hours composing would be
  rejected by Sandy for whatever reasons....maybe he might think my
  essay was off-topic, or used one of the Seven Deadly Words, or was
  "too flamish." Whatever. I realized that life is too short to have
  Sandy Sandfort deciding whether my essays should go out to the main
  list (which is really just a list like Eric Blossom's best-of list,
  except it is be edict now the main list) or be dumped into the flames
  list, to be read by a handful of people.)
* Why, many reasonable people may ask, did I not simply unsubscribe from
the "Cypherpunks" list and subscribe to the "Cypherpunks-Unedited) (or
whatever it is called) list? Because of my overall anger with the issues
raised above. The imperiousness of the decision, the notion of favoring
Sandy's tastes in a more "first class" way than, say, the tastes of Eric
Blossom, Ray Arachelian, or, for that matter, me.  "Some censors are
  more equal than others."
* The decision to "moderate" (censor) the Cypherpunks list is powerful
ammunition to give to our opponents, and Vulis is certainly gleeful that
his fondest wishes have been realized. And it won't work. People are
consuming even more bandwidth arguing the merits of John's decision, the
traffic is presumably being slowed down by the need for Sandy to wade
through the traffic and stamp "Approved" or "Rejected" on what he
  glances at, and people are "testing the limits" of what they can say
  and what they can't say.
* It also sends a message that people are incapable of filtering out bad
speech, that they need a censor to do it for them. (Again, I have no
problem with competing "screeners," a la having Ray, Eric, or David
Sternlight filtering what they think is OK and what is not. Let a
  thousand filtering services bloom.) But the clear message by having
  Sandy censor the main list (the default list, the list name with the
  main name, the list we all know about, etc.) is that Cypherpunks need
  Big Brother to shelter them from Bad Thoughts, from Naughty Words,
  from Evil Flames, and from Impure Desires. Foo on that.
* Psychologists might point to random reinforcement, even to the
  effects of terror. How many of us are likely to write controversial
  posts knowing that Sandy might wake up having a "bad hair day" and
  thus reject our posts? How many will begin to skew their opinions to
  match those of Sandy? (I would venture a guess that a Duncan Frissell
  would almost certainly get a libertarian rant past Sandy while a
  Phill Hallam-Baker might easily fail to get a leftist rant past him.)
* Those who want "less noise" should subcontract with the filter
  services of their own choosing. This is the "Cypherpunk Way." Having
  Sandy as the censor is the easy way out.
* By the way, the moderated list "RISKS"  works pretty well. But it is
  not a _discussion_ group. It is, rather, a digest of news items
  related to computer and technology risks, with some discussion by
  various contributors, and with a long turnaround time of a few issues
  per week, tops. Peter Neumann also devotes a lot of time to making it
  run smoothly and bases part of his professional career on running it.
  I surmise that Sandy is not prepared to do the same. Nor would this
  be a good idea, as this would kill the spirit of the debate.
* Had there been a debate about the policy, I can think of several
approaches I'd like better. But inasmuch as John made it clear that
  there would be no debate (and, perhaps as part of the "problem," John
  has not really been a active member of the mailing list, in terms of
  participating in the debates), this is all moot.
In any case, my several years with the list have taken a huge amount of
my time. Given the way this whole thing was handled, and the way the
list is degenerating even further, it looks like it's good that I'm
moving on to other things.
* To summarize:
- the decision to censor the list was made without any discussion on the
list, without any discussion with at least some of the longterm core
contributors, and was presented as a "fait accompli."
- while John has every right to do with his hardware as he wishes, he
  does not "own" the Cypherpunks group (though whether he owns the
  "list" is a semantically debatable point)
- whatever our group once was, or still is, is not dependent on having a
particular mailing list running on someone's home machine...and it
  cannot be claimed that any person "owns" the Cypherpunks group.
- there is some talk of creating another Cypherpunks list, on other
machines; I don't know whether or not this will fly, or if I'll devote
  any time to such lists.
- the effect of censorship, such as I have seen it so far, is not
  producing a better list. In fact, as I would have expected, it is
  producing a more boring and sheltered list.
And so there you have it.
I had no plans to set down my views, feeling it was a waste of my time
and your time. Rather than foam and rant the way some did (and Vulis
must have posted 100 messages on the subject), I chose to simply make
my exit, quickly.
But as I have recently seen several mentions of my absence (including a
particularly complimentary comment from Asgaard--thanks), I do feel I
owe it to you all to explain my views.
Which I have done. Have a nice year, and a nice millenium in a couple
of years.

A couple of people have sent me pinging messages, asking about my
status on the Cypherpunks list....apparently it has taken several weeks
for folks to notice my absence! :-}  This may speak volumes about why I
have left the list, and what the list has become.....
I chose not to write a "departing flame" (or message, but some might
call it a flame) when I unsubscribed several weeks ago--within an hour
of reading that John and Sandy had decided to make "their" list a
moderated list, by the way--as I saw little benefit. I was also fed up
with things, and saw no point in wasting even more of my time arguing
against the New Cypherpunks World Order, as the NCWO was clearly
presented as a fait accompli, not something ablut which opinions of
list members (or even list _founders_, at least not me) were being
sought. It's my nature to just say "Fuck it" and leave when I feel I
have overstayed my time, or things are no longer fun, or I am made to
feel unwelcome.
But since several people have pinged me, asking about my status, I'll
take some time to say a few things. I've had access to the hks.net
archive site, and/or the Singapore site, to occasionally see what was
being said on the list (old habits die slowly, so I sometimes drop in
to see what you people are flaming each other about...not
surprisingly--in fact utterly predictably--I see vast amounts of
bandwidth consumed by arguments about moderation, about the putative
biases of the Moderator and Director of the New Cypherpunks World
Order, about alternative moderation strategies (which is stupid, as
John and Sandy announced what they were going to do, not just some of
their preliminary thoughts), and so on. I've also noticed fewer
substantive essays. With no false modesty I tried awfully hard to
compose substantive essays on crypto-political topics, often more than
one per day. (Others did too, but they seem to be tapering off as well,
leaving the list to be dominated by something called a "Toto," the
"O.J. was framed!" ravings of Dale Thorn, the love letters between
Vulis and someone name Nurdane Oksas, and the occasional bit of crypto
news. Ho hum. I'm glad I'm not reading the list in e-mail, and thus can
easily avoid replying to these inanities...which would probably not be
approved for reading by Sandy, so why bother anyway?)
Rather than compose a traditional essay, I'll take the  easy way out and
list some bulleted points.
* First, I don't argue that John Gilmore is unfree to do as he wishes
  with his machine, toad, which has been the major machine host for the
Cypherpunks list. John can tell us we have to write in Pig Latin if he
wishes. Much of the debate I saw in the archives was debate that missed
  the point about what John could and couldn't do. No one can seriously
  question the right of the owner of a machine, or the owner of a
  restaurant, etc., to set the policies he wishes. The owner of a
  restaurant is perfectly free--or used to be, and still is to anyone
  with even slightly libertarian or freedom tendencies--to set the
  rules of his "house." He may insist that shirts and shoes be worn, or
  that smoking is not allowed (or even is required, in theory), etc. He
  may say "All those eating in my restaurant must wear funny hats and
  have their costumes approved by Sandy Sandfort." This is
  unexceptionable.
* However, anyone who disputes these rules (disputes in the sense of
disliking or disagreeing with them, not legally challenging them) is
  free to leave. Those who don't like crowded, noisy, smoke-filled
  sports bars are encourgaged to leave. And so on. Again,
  unexceptionable.
(The more complicated case of contracts, verbal or written, and
"changing the rules," does not apply here. No one had a contract with
John, or Sandy, or Hugh, etc., so this is not germane.)
* But the really important issue is this: is the _physical hosting_ of
  the Cypherpunks mailing list coterminous with the "Cypherpunks"? If
  the list was hosted by, say, UC Berkeley or PGP Incorporated, would
  we consider these hosts to be the "owners" of the Cypherpunks group?
  Would we think that a corporate host, say, would have the authority
  to direct what we could say on the list? (Again, not disputing their
  corporate property rights...as a libertarian, I cannot. Other issues
  are what I'm getting at.)
* If a Boy Scout troop meets at a local church, and has for several
  years, continuously, would we consider the church to be the owner of
  the troop? Could the church insist on avoidance of certain "cuss
  words" and demand that prayers be said before each gathering?
  Certainly the church could tell the troop what policies were to be
  followed if the the facilities were to be used, etc., and the troop
  could leave if it didn't like the terms (or, in parallel with my
  situation, any troop member could choose to leave....). This is what
  we mean by "property rights": the legal right of a property owner to
  do with his property as he wishes, modulo prior contractual
  relationships, criminal laws, etc.
* How did the mailing list for the group, now called Cypherpunks, get
started, and how did it end up being run off of John's hardare? Hugh
  Daniel got the actual mailing list rolling, based on a discussion
  Eric Hughes, Hugh, and I had the day after the first physical
  meeting, in September 1992. We thought the group we had just spent
  the day with ought to be able to stay in touch, and that a mailing
  list was the right way to go. There was talk of siting it on the UC
  Berkeley computers (actually, the Undergraduate Association
  computers, a la the Cypherpunks archive site at "csua"), but Hugh
  thought he might be able to use "toad," and this is what happened. (I
  have not heard from Hugh on his views of this New and Moderated
  Non-Anarchic List.)
* I think we should all be very grateful to John for agreeing to let it
  run on his hardware, but not let our gratitude turn into some sort of
subservience and blather about how John "owns" the Cypherpunks group.
* Again, is the "Cyherpunks community" the same as the mailing list?
  And is the mailing list, hosted at toad, the "property" of John
  Gilmore?
* In my view, neither John nor Sandy in any sense "own" our group. It
  is a virtual community which sometimes has physical meetings at
  various places (including corporations, restaurants, and bookstores,
  none of which are even partial "owners" of the group) and which has
  had several instantiations on the Net, including sub-lists not
  connected to toad.com in any way. While John is of course free at any
  time to suspend his hosting of the list, I think it a serious
  misapprehension of the basic nature of virtual communities to accept
  the claim that John should decide on what is appropriate to bear the
  "Cypherpunks" list imprimatur and what is to be consigned to the
  flame list.
* The mechanics of the announcement troubled me greatly. To be blunt, I
  was seething with anger. I was mightily annoyed to read that John had
  made a decision to appoint Sandy as his Moderator, with no discussion
  on the list. I don't know if Eric Hughes and Hugh Daniel were asked
  their opinions, but I certainly know I was not. I feel that as one of
  the two or three founders, depending on how one is counting, and as a
  frequent contributor to the list since its inception, and so on, I
  (and others) should at least have been told of this plan. Better yet,
  have the plans discussed on the list, as some good ideas may have
  been generated.
I'll have more to say about my problems with how things were handled.
Frankly, it smacked of the same kind of fait accompli decision John made
with the unsubscribing of Vulis. While John had (and has) every legal
right to do with his property as he wished, the effect was very
negative. First, Vulis found other ways to post (duh). Second, the list
was consumed with flames about this, many from Vulis, and many from
others. Third, journalists (who love sizzle over substance any day of
the week) lept into the fray with articles which gave Vulis the
publicity he craved. Fourth, it sent a message to enemies of liberty
that "Even the Cypherpunks have found it necessary to abandon their
anarchic ways."
(I'm well aware of the issues with pests like Vulis, who seek to destroy
virtual communities like ours. But the solution John used did not work,
and generated more crap. As you all should know, it was John himself
who coined the wonderful saying, "The Net interprets censorship as
damage and routes around it." A delicious irony.)
* In the archives, I did see a bunch of "I support Sandy" and "John is
  our leader" comments from reasonable people. The obvious noise of
  Vulis and his cohorts like Aga made a "Do something!" attitude
  somewhat understandable. I don't think the decision made was a wise
  one, and I strongly doubt it will work to make the list a better one.
* The proper solution to bad speech is more speech, not censorship.
Censorship just makes opponents of "speech anarchy" happy--it affirms
  their basic belief that censors are needed.
* "Censorship" is another overloaded term. I don't think the
  "Definition 1" of dictionary definitions, about _governmental_

* But the really important issue is this: is the _physical hosting_ of
  the Cypherpunks mailing list coterminous with the "Cypherpunks"? If
  the list was hosted by, say, UC Berkeley or PGP Incorporated, would
  we consider these hosts to be the "owners" of the Cypherpunks group?
  Would we think that a corporate host, say, would have the authority
  to direct what we could say on the list? (Again, not disputing their
  corporate property rights...as a libertarian, I cannot. Other issues
  are what I'm getting at.)
* If a Boy Scout troop meets at a local church, and has for several
  years, continuously, would we consider the church to be the owner of
  the troop? Could the church insist on avoidance of certain "cuss
  words" and demand that prayers be said before each gathering?
  Certainly the church could tell the troop what policies were to be
  followed if the the facilities were to be used, etc., and the troop
  could leave if it didn't like the terms (or, in parallel with my
  situation, any troop member could choose to leave....). This is what
  we mean by "property rights": the legal right of a property owner to
  do with his property as he wishes, modulo prior contractual
  relationships, criminal laws, etc.
* How did the mailing list for the group, now called Cypherpunks, get
started, and how did it end up being run off of John's hardare? Hugh
  Daniel got the actual mailing list rolling, based on a discussion
  Eric Hughes, Hugh, and I had the day after the first physical
  meeting, in September 1992. We thought the group we had just spent
  the day with ought to be able to stay in touch, and that a mailing
  list was the right way to go. There was talk of siting it on the UC
  Berkeley computers (actually, the Undergraduate Association
  computers, a la the Cypherpunks archive site at "csua"), but Hugh
  thought he might be able to use "toad," and this is what happened. (I
  have not heard from Hugh on his views of this New and Moderated
  Non-Anarchic List.)
* I think we should all be very grateful to John for agreeing to let it
  run on his hardware, but not let our gratitude turn into some sort of
subservience and blather about how John "owns" the Cypherpunks group.
* Again, is the "Cyherpunks community" the same as the mailing list?
  And is the mailing list, hosted at toad, the "property" of John
  Gilmore?
* In my view, neither John nor Sandy in any sense "own" our group. It
  is a virtual community which sometimes has physical meetings at
  various places (including corporations, restaurants, and bookstores,
  none of which are even partial "owners" of the group) and which has
  had several instantiations on the Net, including sub-lists not
  connected to toad.com in any way. While John is of course free at any
  time to suspend his hosting of the list, I think it a serious
  misapprehension of the basic nature of virtual communities to accept
  the claim that John should decide on what is appropriate to bear the
  "Cypherpunks" list imprimatur and what is to be consigned to the
  flame list.
* The mechanics of the announcement troubled me greatly. To be blunt, I
  was seething with anger. I was mightily annoyed to read that John had
  made a decision to appoint Sandy as his Moderator, with no discussion
  on the list. I don't know if Eric Hughes and Hugh Daniel were asked
  their opinions, but I certainly know I was not. I feel that as one of
  the two or three founders, depending on how one is counting, and as a
  frequent contributor to the list since its inception, and so on, I
  (and others) should at least have been told of this plan. Better yet,
  have the plans discussed on the list, as some good ideas may have
  been generated.
I'll have more to say about my problems with how things were handled.
Frankly, it smacked of the same kind of fait accompli decision John made
with the unsubscribing of Vulis. While John had (and has) every legal
right to do with his property as he wished, the effect was very
negative. First, Vulis found other ways to post (duh). Second, the list
was consumed with flames about this, many from Vulis, and many from
others. Third, journalists (who love sizzle over substance any day of
the week) lept into the fray with articles which gave Vulis the
publicity he craved. Fourth, it sent a message to enemies of liberty
that "Even the Cypherpunks have found it necessary to abandon their
anarchic ways."
(I'm well aware of the issues with pests like Vulis, who seek to destroy
virtual communities like ours. But the solution John used did not work,
and generated more crap. As you all should know, it was John himself
who coined the wonderful saying, "The Net interprets censorship as
damage and routes around it." A delicious irony.)
* In the archives, I did see a bunch of "I support Sandy" and "John is
  our leader" comments from reasonable people. The obvious noise of
  Vulis and his cohorts like Aga made a "Do something!" attitude
  somewhat understandable. I don't think the decision made was a wise
  one, and I strongly doubt it will work to make the list a better one.
* The proper solution to bad speech is more speech, not censorship.
Censorship just makes opponents of "speech anarchy" happy--it affirms
  their basic belief that censors are needed.
* "Censorship" is another overloaded term. I don't think the
  "Definition 1" of dictionary definitions, about _governmental_
  restrictions, is the only meaningful definition. Everybody knows what
  it meant when we say that "Lockheed is censoring the views of
  employees," even though we know Lockheed is not using government
  power. A censor is one who censors. And even my "American Heritage
  Dictionary" gives this as its "definition 1":
"censor n. 1. A person authorized to examine books, films, or other
material and to remove or suppress morally, politically, or otherwise
(Other dictionaries of course give similar definitions. The notion that
censors are confined to being government employees is a misconception.)
* OK, even given that John had decided to censor "his" list, what about
  his choice of Sandy Sandfort as the censor? I've known Sandy for
  several years (I was the one who invited him to the second
  Cypherpunks meeting), but he's a poor choice as a censor, moderator,
  whatever. First, because he has so often gotten involved in
  protracted flame wars, such as with Vulis (remember the dozens of
  messages about the "bet" to bring Vulis out? I stayed out of the
  charade completely.), with Hallam-Baker, and with others. Second,
  because he has not been actively composing essays for a while,
  perhaps because of his job with Community Connexion. Other reasons,
  too.
(I count Sandy as a friend, but I'm just being honest here. Sandy is
just not a "Peter Neumann" (moderator of the "RISKS" list).
* Nor do the announced criteria make any sense. While the inane one-line
scatological insults have been filtered out, many "flames" make it
  through, based on what I've seen in perusing the hks archive site.
  And some reasonable comments get dumped in the flame bucket.
* As expected, those who only want to talk about cryptography (but who
rarely do, themselves, also as expected) waste bandwidth saying the
"anarchist" and "libertarian" stuff ought to go in to the "rejected"
  list. More bandwidth wasted, as each group lobbies to have its
  ideological opponents censored by Sandy.
* I would have had no problem had John announced that he was creating a
  new list, the "Good Stuff" list, with Sandy has his Chooser of Good
  Stuff. After all, both Eric Blossom and Ray Arachelian already offer
  just such lists, and more would not hurt.
But by making the _main list_ the censored one, this skewed things
* (Frankly, one of my considerations in leaving was the feeling that I
would never know if an essay I'd spent hours composing would be
  rejected by Sandy for whatever reasons....maybe he might think my
  essay was off-topic, or used one of the Seven Deadly Words, or was
  "too flamish." Whatever. I realized that life is too short to have
  Sandy Sandfort deciding whether my essays should go out to the main
  list (which is really just a list like Eric Blossom's best-of list,
  except it is be edict now the main list) or be dumped into the flames
  list, to be read by a handful of people.)
* Why, many reasonable people may ask, did I not simply unsubscribe from
the "Cypherpunks" list and subscribe to the "Cypherpunks-Unedited) (or
whatever it is called) list? Because of my overall anger with the issues
raised above. The imperiousness of the decision, the notion of favoring
Sandy's tastes in a more "first class" way than, say, the tastes of Eric
Blossom, Ray Arachelian, or, for that matter, me.  "Some censors are
  more equal than others."
* The decision to "moderate" (censor) the Cypherpunks list is powerful
ammunition to give to our opponents, and Vulis is certainly gleeful that
his fondest wishes have been realized. And it won't work. People are
consuming even more bandwidth arguing the merits of John's decision, the
traffic is presumably being slowed down by the need for Sandy to wade
through the traffic and stamp "Approved" or "Rejected" on what he
  glances at, and people are "testing the limits" of what they can say
  and what they can't say.
* It also sends a message that people are incapable of filtering out bad
speech, that they need a censor to do it for them. (Again, I have no
problem with competing "screeners," a la having Ray, Eric, or David
Sternlight filtering what they think is OK and what is not. Let a
  thousand filtering services bloom.) But the clear message by having
  Sandy censor the main list (the default list, the list name with the
  main name, the list we all know about, etc.) is that Cypherpunks need
  Big Brother to shelter them from Bad Thoughts, from Naughty Words,
  from Evil Flames, and from Impure Desires. Foo on that.
* Psychologists might point to random reinforcement, even to the
  effects of terror. How many of us are likely to write controversial
  posts knowing that Sandy might wake up having a "bad hair day" and
  thus reject our posts? How many will begin to skew their opinions to
  match those of Sandy? (I would venture a guess that a Duncan Frissell
  would almost certainly get a libertarian rant past Sandy while a
  Phill Hallam-Baker might easily fail to get a leftist rant past him.)
* Those who want "less noise" should subcontract with the filter
  services of their own choosing. This is the "Cypherpunk Way." Having
  Sandy as the censor is the easy way out.
* By the way, the moderated list "RISKS"  works pretty well. But it is
  not a _discussion_ group. It is, rather, a digest of news items
  related to computer and technology risks, with some discussion by
  various contributors, and with a long turnaround time of a few issues
  per week, tops. Peter Neumann also devotes a lot of time to making it
  run smoothly and bases part of his professional career on running it.
  I surmise that Sandy is not prepared to do the same. Nor would this
  be a good idea, as this would kill the spirit of the debate.
* Had there been a debate about the policy, I can think of several
approaches I'd like better. But inasmuch as John made it clear that
  there would be no debate (and, perhaps as part of the "problem," John
  has not really been a active member of the mailing list, in terms of
  participating in the debates), this is all moot.
In any case, my several years with the list have taken a huge amount of
my time. Given the way this whole thing was handled, and the way the
list is degenerating even further, it looks like it's good that I'm
moving on to other things.
* To summarize:
- the decision to censor the list was made without any discussion on the
list, without any discussion with at least some of the longterm core
contributors, and was presented as a "fait accompli."
- while John has every right to do with his hardware as he wishes, he
  does not "own" the Cypherpunks group (though whether he owns the
  "list" is a semantically debatable point)
- whatever our group once was, or still is, is not dependent on having a
particular mailing list running on someone's home machine...and it
  cannot be claimed that any person "owns" the Cypherpunks group.
- there is some talk of creating another Cypherpunks list, on other
machines; I don't know whether or not this will fly, or if I'll devote
  any time to such lists.
- the effect of censorship, such as I have seen it so far, is not
  producing a better list. In fact, as I would have expected, it is
  producing a more boring and sheltered list.
And so there you have it.
I had no plans to set down my views, feeling it was a waste of my time
and your time. Rather than foam and rant the way some did (and Vulis
must have posted 100 messages on the subject), I chose to simply make
my exit, quickly.
But as I have recently seen several mentions of my absence (including a
particularly complimentary comment from Asgaard--thanks), I do feel I
owe it to you all to explain my views.
Which I have done. Have a nice year, and a nice millenium in a couple
of years.

 Subject: from Zenaan - was Fwd: Delivery Status
Notification (Failure)
OK, new threads by me are definitely getting rejected, and
instantaneously too...
Due to a separate rejection, I take it that cross-posting has also
been banned for my email address.
I will not do any run around of creating (or using) an alternate email
address especially for cp
That's just an arms race and as I've always said:
- it has been and remains my intention to respect the intentions of
the founders/ creators of this mailing list
So whoever is running/ administrating this list has decided they want
to clip my wings. In principle that's fair enough, BUT:
- no one ever emailed me offlist or onlist saying that they are an
administrator of the list and that they wanted me to post less, or to
meet some other conditions
- such behaviour is cowardly, like a stab in the back
- such behaviour provides no opportunity for me to respect the
administrator(s) of the list - since they never owned up to being an
administrator, and never admitted to me their requirements about
posting less or in some other way, they are being cowardly and
providing no opportunity to me, to meet their requirements
- I do not accept cowardly behaviour from list administrators
- I thought cp@ was not a list of cowards, or for cowards
I am not interested in participating in half a mailing list (one where
I can only receive emails and reply to other people, but not post new
threads and not cross-post).
I am not interested in participating in a mailing list where temporary
(or permanent) restrictions are put in place without notice to the
person being restricted. I will not accept such cowardly behaviour.
SO, short of the cypherpunks list administrator(s) apologising to me
for their cowardliness, and reinstating my posting privileges for my
primary email address, and stating clearly their requirements for
posting to the list, and doing this publicly on the list so other
people know the requirements for posting to the list, then I shall
remove myself from this so-called "community" and find some other
place where who I am is respected, and where cowards are told to grow
the fuck up! Some place where children are not pretending they're
adults with their cowardly behaviour.
Alex, Juan, Jim, coderman and Steve, in one way or another you have
eached gained my respect. Thank you each for being who you are. If any
of you have a suggestion for an alternate mailing list, I would
certainly consider joining. I am still not in a stable enough living
environment nor with any ADSL internet access, so I am still not in a
position to set up an email server myself - but I am confident that
this situation will change within about 1 year.
Best regards,
PS, if anyone wants to post this email publicly, I certainly consent
to you doing so.

OK, new threads by me are definitely getting rejected, and
instantaneously too...
Due to a separate rejection, I take it that cross-posting has also
been banned for my email address.
I will not do any run around of creating (or using) an alternate email
address especially for cp at .
That's just an arms race and as I've always said:
- it has been and remains my intention to respect the intentions of
the founders/ creators of this mailing list
So whoever is running/ administrating this list has decided they want
to clip my wings. In principle that's fair enough, BUT:
- no one ever emailed me offlist or onlist saying that they are an
administrator of the list and that they wanted me to post less, or to
meet some other conditions
- such behaviour is cowardly, like a stab in the back
- such behaviour provides no opportunity for me to respect the
administrator(s) of the list - since they never owned up to being an
administrator, and never admitted to me their requirements about
posting less or in some other way, they are being cowardly and
providing no opportunity to me, to meet their requirements
- I do not accept cowardly behaviour from list administrators
- I thought cp@ was not a list of cowards, or for cowards
I am not interested in participating in half a mailing list (one where
I can only receive emails and reply to other people, but not post new
threads and not cross-post).
I am not interested in participating in a mailing list where temporary
(or permanent) restrictions are put in place without notice to the
person being restricted. I will not accept such cowardly behaviour.
SO, short of the cypherpunks list administrator(s) apologising to me
for their cowardliness, and reinstating my posting privileges for my
primary email address, and stating clearly their requirements for
posting to the list, and doing this publicly on the list so other
people know the requirements for posting to the list, then I shall
remove myself from this so-called "community" and find some other
place where who I am is respected, and where cowards are told to grow
the fuck up! Some place where children are not pretending they're
adults with their cowardly behaviour.
Alex, Juan, Jim, coderman and Steve, in one way or another you have
eached gained my respect. Thank you each for being who you are. If any
of you have a suggestion for an alternate mailing list, I would
certainly consider joining. I am still not in a stable enough living
environment nor with any ADSL internet access, so I am still not in a
position to set up an email server myself - but I am confident that
this situation will change within about 1 year.
Best regards,
PS, if anyone wants to post this email publicly, I certainly consent
to you doing so.

country will be forever blameless. Adams: 	[holding a slice of chocolate

(south park - season 7 ep 1)
Adams: 	We must go to war!
Dickinson: 	But what about the violence?! The lives lost?! If we
found a country, it should be founded on peace and diplomacy.
Congressman 1: 	England will only understand one thing: Force.
Congressman 2: 	[rises] I must state again for the record that
South Carolina, North Carolina,
 Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Georgia are against war! [pounds the table
 with his fist] Congressman 3: 	Yeah, because you don't care
 about the fate of the Colonies like we do! You're all unpatriotic! And
 if you don't like the Colonies, then you can git out!  	Don't you call us unpatriotic! We're protesting this war
 because we care so deeply for the fate of our Colonies! You are all
 unpatriotic for leading the Colonies into a war that half of them
 don't want! [the various Congressmen begin squabblig with each other]
Cartman: 	[observing] Whoa, how very very relevant. Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble
Rabble Rabble! Dickinson: 	We cannot found a country based on
war! Adams: 	We cannot found a country that is afraid to fight!
Congressman: 	Rabble!
Congressmen: 	Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble Rabble!
[the doors open and in walks an august figure. The boisterous voices
become hushed] Oh my, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.
It's Benjamin Franklin. [they keep murmuring this as Franklin walks
towards the main desk] Cartman: 	Oh, it's Benjamin Franklin. It's Benjamin Franklin.
It's Benjamin Franklin. Hancock: 	Mr. Franklin, where do you stand on the war issue? Franklin: 	I believe that if we are to form a new country, we
cannot be a country that appears war-hungry and violent to the rest of
the world. However, we also cannot be a country that appears weak and
unwilling to fight to the rest of the world. So, what if we form a
country that appears to want both? Jefferson: 	Yes. Yes of course. We go to war, and
protest going to war at the same time. Dickinson: 	Right. If the people of our new country are allowed
to do whatever they wish, then some will support the war and some will
protest it. Franklin:      And that means that as a nation, we could go to war
with whomever we wished, but at the same time, act like we didn't want
to. If we allow the people to protest what the government does, then the
country will be forever blameless. Adams: 	[holding a slice of chocolate
cake] It's like having your cake, and eating it, too. Congressman 2:	Think of it: an entire nation founded on saying
one thing and doing another. Hancock: 	And we will call that country the
United States of America. Think of it: an entire nation founded on saying one thing and
doing another.

JESUS CHRIST - NO HISTORICAL EVIDENCE
IN ONE OF THE MOST CAREFULLY DOCUMENTED PERIODS OF ROMAN AND ANCIENT
HISTORY The time that Jesus Christ supposedly existed is one the most heavily
documented periods in ancient history.  Yet there is virtually zero
historical evidence of his supposed existence in any contemporary
historical record.  It is also important to understand that an absolute
reign of terror was instituted when Christianity seized power in the
Roman Empire as documented in our Christian Totalitarianism Report.
The Church appointed an official historian of dubious ethics, Eusebius,
to write an official history.  Meanwhile, Christian launched the
largest book burning campaign in history, destroying a vast part of the
wisdom and history of the ancient world forever. The Account of Josephus is a Fraud
When discussing the alleged existence of Jesus Christ, one piece of
"evidence" that frequently gets mentioned is the account of Flavius
Josephus, the famed Jewish general and historian who lived from 37 to
100 C.E. In Josephus's Antiquities of the Jews there is a notorious
passage regarding Christ called the "Testimonium Flavium."
"Now, there was about this time, Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to
call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works,--a teacher of
such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both
many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ; and
when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had
condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not
forsake him, for he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the
divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful
things concerning him; and the tribe of Christians, so named from him,
are not extinct at this day." (Whitson, 379).
This brief piece of evidence which supposedly contributed the best
"proof" of Jesus's existence has actually been proven to be a fraud. It
has been demonstrated continuously over the centuries that "Testamonium
Flavium" was a forgery manufactured by the Catholic Church, and was
inserted into Josephus's works. The Testamonium Flavium account is so
thoroughly refuted, that biblical scholars since the 19th century have
refused to refer to it, unless to mention its false nature.
Dr. Gordon Stein gives a further explanation for this forgery. The
History of Jesus: A Reply to Josh McDowell.
Another source is The Jesus Forgery: Josephus Untangled.
First Written Accounts of Jesus's Life Occur Decades After His
Purported Existence
Most written accounts of the life of Jesus did not exist until a couple
decades after his purported existence. These accounts were presented by
a number of different authors and had somewhat conflicting stories
about his existence. These written accounts are known as the Gospels.
Also, it is worth knowing that not all of the gospels that were written
even made their way into the bible. Only four gospels became the
canonical writings for the church. The rest were burned, destroyed or
lost. Historians estimate that the first written gospel, the gospel of
Mark, was written sometime after 70 C.E, which means that at the
earliest, it would have been written 40 years after the alleged
crucifixion of Jesus.
PLINY, TACITUS AND SUETONIUS: NO PROOF OF JESUS
Nero's Persecution of Christians and Mention of Jesus is Highly Doubtful
There is widespread belief that Nero blamed the burning of Rome on the
Christians; however, there are many holes in this theory.
This belief comes from the account of the Roman historian Tacitus
(56-120 CE) about how Emperor Nero (37 - 68 CE) blamed the burning of
Rome on "those people who were abhorred for their crimes and commonly
called Christians." The passage then states that the fire agitators
were followers of "Christus" who "was put to death as a criminal by the
procurator Pontius Pilate." The passage then also states that
Christians constituted a "vast multitude at Rome" and goes on to
discuss the ghastly ways in which they were persecuted.
However, there are many troubling details about the historical accuracy
of this passage. Some critics call into question whether Tacitus wrote
this account at all, or if it was yet another forgery. Around the date
of Nero's Fire, 64 AD, there were no "multitude of Christians" in Rome.
At this time, there was not even a multitude of Christians in Judea.
Therefore, it is highly doubtful that Nero would refer to Christians in
this way.
This is also the only mention of Christians in the work of Tacitus,
despite the fact that he wrote several volumes
Also, the supposed persecution of the Christians by Nero is not
recorded by any other historian of Nero's time. If the persecution of
Christians were really that widespread, wouldn't other historians be
writing about it? (Truth Be Known)
Pliny's Letter About "Christiani"
In addition to the Testomonium Flavianum, there exists another tenuous
piece of evidence that some have tried to use as proof for the
existence of Jesus. The Roman Historian, Pliny The Younger (62-113CE),
wrote a letter to the Emperor Trajan in 110 CE requesting his
assistance in the proper punishment of a group of "Christiani" who were
causing trouble and would not bow to the image of the emperor.
According to Pliny, these Christiani would meet before daylight and
sing hymns with responses to "Christ as God."
However, this letter does not provide concrete evidence for the
existence of Jesus as a person since it makes no direct mention of
"Jesus of Nazareth," nor does it refer to his life. Also, there are
many critics who have argued that this letter is a forgery. (Truth Be
Suetonius's Reference to "Chresto"
The last piece of questionable historical evidence we'll discuss here
is the passage in Suetonius's Life of Claudius, dating around 110 CE.
There is a reference in this work to a figure named "Chresto" who
caused the Jews to riot in Rome. First of all, if Jesus Christ did
exist, it is not possible that he would have been in Rome at this time.
Claudius reigned from 41-54 CE, this is at the time of Christ's alleged

@_subject: USA: National Security Strategy, Juan's Wet Dream 
This article written by former Interim President and current member of
the Board of Directors Frank Zindler and is reprinted from the Summer
1998 edition of American Atheist magazine.
    I have taken it for granted that Jesus of Nazareth existed. Some
    writers feel a need to justify this assumption at length against
    people who try from time to time to deny it. It would be easier,
    frankly, to believe that Tiberius Caesar, Jesus’ contemporary, was
    a figment of the imagination than to believe that there never was
    such a person as Jesus. – N. T. Wright, Jesus and the Victory of
    God (Fortress, 1996)
For most of my life, I had taken it for granted that Jesus, although
certainly not a god, was nevertheless an historical personage – perhaps
a magician skilled in hypnosis. To be sure, I knew that some of the
world’s greatest scholars had denied his existence. Nevertheless, I had
always more or less supposed that it was improbable that so many
stories could have sprung up about someone who had never existed. Even
in the case of other deities, such as Zeus, Thor, Isis, and Osiris, I
had always taken it for granted that they were merely deified human
heroes: men and women who lived in the later stages of prehistory –
persons whose reputations got better and better the longer the time
elapsed after their deaths. Gods, like fine wines, I supposed, improved
with age.
About a decade ago, however, I began to reexamine the evidence for the
historicity of Jesus. I was astounded at what I didn’t find. In this
article, I would like to show how shaky the evidence is regarding the
alleged existence of a would-be messiah named Jesus. I now feel it is
more reasonable to suppose he never existed. It is easier to account
for the facts of early Christian history if Jesus were a fiction than
if he once were real. Burden of Proof
Although what follows may fairly be interpreted to be a proof of the
non-historicity of Jesus, it must be realized that the burden of proof
does not rest upon the skeptic in this matter. As always is the case,
the burden of proof weighs upon those who assert that some thing or
some process exists. If someone claims that he never has to shave
because every morning before he can get to the bathroom he is assaulted
by a six-foot rabbit with extremely sharp teeth who trims his whiskers
better than a razor – if someone makes such a claim, no skeptic need
worry about constructing a disproof. Unless evidence for the claim is
produced, the skeptic can treat the claim as false. This is nothing
more than sane, every-day practice.
Unlike N. T. Wright, quoted at the beginning of this article, a small
number of scholars have tried over the centuries to prove that Jesus
was in fact historical. It is instructive, when examining their
“evidence,” to compare it to the sort of evidence we have, say, for the
existence of Tiberius Cæsar – to take up the challenge made by Wright.
It may be conceded that it is not surprising that there are no coins
surviving from the first century with the image of Jesus on them.
Unlike Tiberius Cæsar and Augustus Cæsar who adopted him, Jesus is not
thought to have had control over any mints. Even so, we must point out
that we do have coins dating from the early first century that bear
images of Tiberius that change with the age of their subject. We even
have coins minted by his predecessor, Augustus Cæsar, that show
Augustus on one side and his adopted son on the other.Citation 1 Would
Mr. Wright have us believe that these coins are figments of the
imagination? Can we be dealing with fig-mints?
Statues that can be dated archaeologically survive to show Tiberius as
a youth, as a young man assuming the toga, as Cæsar, etc.Citation 2
Engravings and gems show him with his entire family.Citation 3
Biographers who were his contemporaries or nearly so quote from his
letters and decrees and recount the details of his life in minute
detail.Citation 4 There are contemporary inscriptions all over the
former empire that record his deeds.Citation 5 There is an ossuary of
at least one member of his family, and the Greek text of a speech made
by his son Germanicus has been found at Oxyrhynchus in Egypt.Citation 6
And then there are the remains of his villa on Capri. Nor should we
forget that Augustus Cæsar, in his Res Gestæ (“Things Accomplished”),
which survives both in Greek and Latin on the so-called Monumentum
Ancyranum, lists Tiberius as his son and co-ruler.Citation 7
Is there anything advocates of an historical Jesus can produce that
could be as compelling as this evidence for Tiberius? I think not, and
I thank N. T. Wright for making a challenge that brings this disparity
so clearly to light.
There is really only one area where evidence for Jesus is even claimed
to be of a sort similar to that adduced for Tiberius – the area of
biographies written by contemporaries or near contemporaries.Note A It
is sometimes claimed that the Christian Bible contains such evidence.
Sometimes it is claimed that there is extrabiblical evidence as well.
Let us then examine this would-be evidence. The Old Testament “Evidence”
Let us consider the so-called biblical evidence first. Despite the
claims of Christian apologists, there is absolutely nothing in the Old
Testament (OT) that is of relevance to our question, apart from the
possible fact that some prophets may have thought that an “anointed
one” (a rescuer king or priest) would once again assume the leadership
of the Jewish world. All of the many examples of OT “predictions” of
Jesus are so silly that one need only look them up to see their
irrelevance. Thomas Paine, the great heretic of the American
Revolution, did just that, and he demonstrated their irrelevance in his
book An Examination of the Prophecies, which he intended to be Part III
of The Age of Reason.Note B The New Testament “Evidence”
The elimination of the OT leaves only the New Testament (NT) “evidence”
and extrabiblical material to be considered. Essentially, the NT is
composed of two types of documents: letters and would-be biographies
(the so-called gospels). A third category of writing, apocalyptic,Note
C of which the Book of Revelation is an example, also exists, but it
gives no support for the historicity of Jesus. In fact, it would appear
to be an intellectual fossil of the thought-world from which
Christianity sprang – a Jewish apocalypse that was reworked for
Christian use.Citation 8 The main character of the book (referred to 28
times) would seem to be “the Lamb,” an astral being seen in visions (no
claims to historicity here!), and the book overall is redolent of
ancient astrology.Citation 9
The name Jesus occurs only seven times in the entire book, Christ only
four times, and Jesus Christ only twice! While Revelation may very well
derive from a very early period (contrary to the views of most biblical
scholars, who deal with the book only in its final form), the Jesus of
which it whispers obviously is not a man. He is a supernatural being.
He has not yet acquired the physiological and metabolic properties of
which we read in the gospels. The Jesus of Revelation is a god who
would later be made into a man – not a man who would later become a
god, as liberal religious scholars would have it. The Gospels
The notion that the four “gospels that made the cut” to be included in
the official New Testament were written by men named Matthew, Mark,
Luke, and John does not go back to early Christian times. The titles
“According to Matthew,” etc., were not added until late in the second
century. Thus, although Papias ca. 140 CE (‘Common Era’) knows all the
gospels but has only heard of Matthew and Mark, Justin Martyr (ca. 150
CE) knows of none of the four supposed authors. It is only in 180 CE,
with Irenæus of Lyons, that we learn who wrote the four “canonical”
gospels and discover that there are exactly four of them because there
are four quarters of the earth and four universal winds. Thus, unless
one supposes the argument of Irenæus to be other than ridiculous, we
come to the conclusion that the gospels are of unknown origin and
authorship, and there is no good reason to suppose they are eye-witness
accounts of a man named Jesus of Nazareth. At a minimum, this forces us
to examine the gospels to see if their contents are even compatible
with the notion that they were written by eye-witnesses. We cannot even
assume that each of the gospels had but one author or redactor.
It is clear that the gospels of Matthew and Luke could not possibly
have been written by an eye-witness of the tales they tell. Both
writers plagiarizeNote D (largely word-for-word) up to 90% of the
gospel of Mark, to which they add sayings of Jesus e and would-be
historical details. Ignoring the fact that Matthew and Luke contradict
each other in such critical details as the genealogy of Jesus – and
thus cannot both be correct – we must ask why real eye-witnesses would
have to plagiarize the entire ham-hocks-and-potatoes of the story,
contenting themselves with adding merely a little gravy, salt, and
pepper. A real eye-witness would have begun with a verse reading, “Now,
boys and girls, I’m gonna tell you the story of Jesus the Messiah the
way it really happened…” The story would be a unique creation. It is
significant that it is only these two gospels that purport to tell
anything of Jesus’ birth, childhood, or ancestry. Both can be dismissed
as unreliable without further cause. We can know nothing of Jesus’
childhood or origin! Mark
But what about the gospel of Mark, the oldest surviving gospel?
Attaining essentially its final form probably as late as 90 CE but
containing core material dating possibly as early as 70 CE, it omits,
as we have seen, almost the entire traditional biography of Jesus,
beginning the story with John the Baptist giving Jesus a bath, and
ending – in the oldest manuscripts – with women running frightened from
the empty tomb. (The alleged postresurrection appearances reported in
the last twelve verses of Mark are not found in the earliest
manuscripts, even though they are still printed in most modern bibles
as though they were an “authentic” part of Mark’s gospel.) Moreover,
“Mark” being a non-Palestinian non-disciple, even the skimpy historical
detail he provides is untrustworthy.
To say that Mark’s account is “skimpy” is to understate the case. There
really isn’t much to the gospel of Mark, the birth legends,
genealogies, and childhood wonders all being absent. Whereas the gospel
of Luke takes up 43 pages in the New English Bible, the gospel of Mark
occupies only 25 pages – a mere 58% as much material! Stories do indeed
grow with the retelling.
I have claimed that the unknown author of Mark was a non-Palestinian
non-disciple, which would make his story mere hearsay. What evidence do
we have for this assertion? First of all, Mark shows no first-hand
understanding of the social situation in Palestine. He is clearly a
foreigner, removed both in space and time from the events he alleges.
For example, in Mark 10:12, he has Jesus say that if a woman divorces
her husband and marries another, she commits adultery. As G. A. Wells,
the author of The Historical Evidence for JesusCitation 10 puts it,
    Such an utterance would have been meaningless in Palestine, where
    only men could obtain divorce. It is a ruling for the Gentile
    Christian readers… which the evangelist put into Jesus’ mouth in
    order to give it authority. This tendency to anchor later customs
    and institutions to Jesus’ supposed lifetime played a considerable
    role in the building up of his biography.
One further evidence of the inauthenticity of Mark is the fact that in
chapter 7, where Jesus is arguing with the Pharisees, Jesus is made to
quote the Greek Septuagint version of Isaiah in order to score his
debate point. Unfortunately, the Hebrew version says something
different from the Greek. Isaiah 29:13, in the Hebrew reads “their fear
of me is a commandment of men learned by rote,” whereas the Greek
version – and the gospel of Mark – reads “in vain do they worship me,
teaching as doctrines the precepts of men” [Revised Standard Version).
Wells observes dryly [p. 13], “That a Palestinian Jesus should floor
Orthodox Jews with an argument based on a mistranslation of their
scriptures is very unlikely.” Indeed!
Another powerful argument against the idea that Mark could have been an
eye-witness of the existence of Jesus is based upon the observation
that the author of Mark displays a profound lack of familiarity with
Palestinian geography. If he had actually lived in Palestine, he would
not have made the blunders to be found in his gospel. If he never lived
in Palestine, he could not have been an eye-witness of Jesus. You get
the point.
The most absurd geographical error Mark commits is when he tells the
tall tale about Jesus crossing over the Sea of Galilee and casting
demons out of a man (two men in Matthew’s revised version) and making
them go into about 2,000 pigs which, as the King James version puts it,
“ran violently down a steep place into the sea… and they were choked in
the sea.”
Apart from the cruelty to animals displayed by the lovable, gentle
Jesus, and his disregard for the property of others, what’s wrong with
this story? If your only source of information is the King James Bible,
you might not ever know. The King James says this marvel occurred in
the land of the Gadarenes, whereas the oldest Greek manuscripts say
this miracle took place in the land of the Gerasenes. Luke, who also
knew no Palestinian geography, also passes on this bit of absurdity.
But Matthew, who had some knowledge of Palestine, changed the name to
Gadarene in his new, improved version; but this is further improved to
Gergesenes in the King James version.
By now the reader must be dizzy with all the distinctions between
Gerasenes, Gadarenes, and Gergesenes. What difference does it make? A
lot of difference, as we shall see.
Gerasa, the place mentioned in the oldest manuscripts of Mark, is
located about 31 miles from the shore of the Sea of Galilee! Those poor
pigs had to run a course five miles longer than a marathon in order to
find a place to drown! Not even lemmings have to go that far. Moreover,
if one considers a “steep” slope to be at least 45 degrees, that would
make the elevation of Gerasa at least six times higher than Mt. Everest!
When the author of Matthew read Mark’s version, he saw the
impossibility of Jesus and the gang disembarking at Gerasa (which, by
the way, was also in a different country, the so-called Decapolis).
Since the only town in the vicinity of the Sea of Galilee that he knew
of that started with G was Gadara, he changed Gerasa to Gadara. But
even Gadara was five miles from the shore – and in a different country.
Later copyists of the Greek manuscripts of all three pig-drowning
gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) improved Gadara further to Gergesa, a
region now thought to have actually formed part of the eastern shore of
the Sea of Galilee. So much for the trustworthiness of the biblical
Another example of Mark’s abysmal ignorance of Palestinian geography is
found in the story he made up about Jesus traveling from Tyre on the
Mediterranean to the Sea of Galilee, 30 miles inland. According to Mark
7:31, Jesus and the boys went by way of Sidon, 20 miles north of Tyre
on the Mediterranean coast! Since to Sidon and back would be 40 miles,
this means that the wisest of all men walked 70 miles when he could
have walked only 30. Of course, one would never know all this from the
King James version which – apparently completely ignoring a perfectly
clear Greek text – says “Departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon,
he came unto the Sea of Galilee…” Apparently the translators of the
King James version also knew their geography. At least they knew more
than did the author of Mark! John
The unreliability of the gospels is underscored when we learn that,
with the possible exception of John, the first three gospels bear no
internal indication of who wrote them. Can we glean anything of
significance from the fourth and latest gospel, the gospel of John? Not
likely! It is so unworldly, it can scarcely be cited for historical
evidence. In this account, Jesus is hardly a man of flesh and blood at
all – except for the purposes of divine cannibalism as required by the
celebration of the rite of “holy communion.”
“In the beginning was the word, and the word was with god, and the word
was god,” the gospel begins. No Star of Bethlehem, no embarrassment of
pregnant virgins, no hint that Jesus ever wore diapers: pure spirit
from the beginning. Moreover, in its present form, the gospel of John
is the latest of all the official gospels.[Note F]
The gospel of John was compiled around the year 110 CE. If its author
had been 10 years old at the time of Jesus’ crucifiction in the year 30
CE, he would have been 80 years old at the time of writing. Not only is
it improbable that he would have lived so long, it is dangerous to pay
much attention to the colorful “memories” recounted by a man in his
“anecdotage.” Many of us who are far younger than this have had the
unpleasant experience of discovering incontrovertible proof that what
we thought were clear memories of some event were wildly incorrect. We
also might wonder why an eye-witness of all the wonders claimed in a
gospel would wait so long to write about them!
More importantly, there is evidence that the Gospel of John, like
Matthew and Luke, also is a composite document, incorporating an
earlier “Signs Gospel” of uncertain antiquity. Again, we ask, if “John”
had been an eye-witness to Jesus, why would he need to plagiarize a
list of miracles made up by someone else? Nor is there anything in the
Signs Gospel that would lead one to suppose that it was an eye-witness
account. It could just as easily have been referring to the wonders of
Dionysus turning water into wine, or to the healings of Asclepius.
The inauthenticity of the Gospel of John would seem to be established
beyond cavil by the discovery that the very chapter that asserts the
author of the book to have been “the disciple whom Jesus loved” [John
21:20] was a late addition to the gospel. Scholars have shown that the
gospel originally ended at verses 30-31 of Chapter 20. Chapter 21 – in
which verse 24 asserts that “This is the disciple which testifieth of
these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is
true” – is not the work of an eye-witness. Like so many other things in
the Bible, it is a fraud. The testimony is not true. Saint Saul And His
Having eliminated the OT and the gospels from the list of possible
biblical “evidences” of the existence of Jesus, we are left with the
so-called epistles.
At first blush, we might think that these epistles – some of which are
by far the oldest parts of the NT, having been composed at least 30
years before the oldest gospel – would provide us with the most
reliable information on Jesus. Well, so much for blushes. The oldest
letters are the letters of St. Saul – the man who, after losing his
mind, changed his name to Paul. Before going into details, we must
point out right away, before we forget, that St. Saul’s testimony can
be ignored quite safely, if what he tells us is true, namely, that he
never met Jesus “in the flesh,” but rather saw him only in a vision he
had during what appears to have been an epileptic seizure. No court of
law would accept visions as evidence, and neither should we.
The reader might object that even if Saul only had hearsay evidence,
some of it might be true. Some of it might tell us some facts about
Jesus. Well, allright. Let’s look at the evidence.
According to tradition, 13 of the letters in the NT are the work of St.
Saul. Unfortunately, Bible scholars and computer experts have gone to
work on these letters, and it turns out that only four can be shown to
be substantially by the same author, putatively Saul. g These are the
letters known as Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Galatians. To these
probably we may add the brief note to Philemon, a slave-owner,
Philippians, and 1 Thessalonians. The rest of the so-called Pauline
epistles can be shown to have been written by other and later authors,
so we can throw them out right now and not worry about them.
Saul tells us in 2 Corinthians 11:32 that King Aretas of the Nabateans
tried to have him arrested because of his Christian agitation. Since
Aretas is known to have died in the year 40 CE, this means that Saul
became a Christian before that date. So what do we find out about Jesus
from a man who had become a Christian less than ten years after the
alleged crucifixion? Precious little!
Once again, G.A. Wells, in his book The Historical Evidence for Jesus
[pp. 22-23], sums things up so succinctly, that I quote him verbatim:
    The…Pauline letters…are so completely silent concerning the events
    that were later recorded in the gospels as to suggest that these
    events were not known to Paul, who, however, could not have been
    ignorant of them if they had really occurred. These letters have no
    allusion to the parents of Jesus, let alone to the virgin birth.
    They never refer to a place of birth (for example, by calling him
    ‘of Nazareth’). They give no indication of the time or place of his
    earthly existence. They do not refer to his trial before a Roman
    official, nor to Jerusalem as the place of execution. They mention
    neither John the Baptist, nor Judas, nor Peter’s denial of his
    master. (They do, of course, mention Peter, but do not imply that
    he, any more than Paul himself, had known Jesus while he had been
    alive.)
    These letters also fail to mention any miracles Jesus is supposed
    to have worked, a particularly striking omission, since, according
    to the gospels, he worked so many.
    Another striking feature of Paul’s letters is that one could never
    gather from them that Jesus had been an ethical teacher… on only
    one occasion does he appeal to the authority of Jesus to support an
    ethical teaching which the gospels also represent Jesus as having
    delivered.
It turns out that Saul’s appeal to the authority of Jesus involves
precisely the same error we found in the gospel of Mark. In 1 Cor.
7:10, Saul says that “not I but the Lord, [say] that the wife should
not separate from the husband.” That is, a wife should not seek
divorce. If Jesus had actually said what Saul implies, and what Mark
10:12 claims he said, his audience would have thought he was nuts – as
the Bhagwan says – or perhaps had suffered a blow to the head. So much
for the testimony of Saul. His Jesus is nothing more than the thinnest
hearsay, a legendary creature which was crucified as a sacrifice, a
creature almost totally lacking a biography. Extrabiblical “Evidence”
So far we have examined all the biblical evidences alleged to prove the
existence of Jesus as an historical figure. We have found that they
have no legitimacy as evidence. Now we must examine the last line of
would-be evidence, the notion that Jewish and pagan historians recorded
his existence. Jewish Sources
It is sometimes claimed that Jewish writings hostile to Christianity
prove that the ancient Jews knew of Jesus and that such writings prove
the historicity of the man Jesus. But in fact, Jewish writings prove no
such thing, as L. Gordon Rylands’ book Did Jesus Ever Live? pointed out
nearly seventy years ago:
    …all the knowledge which the Rabbis had of Jesus was obtained by
    them from the Gospels. Seeing that Jews, even in the present more
    critical age, take it for granted that the figure of a real man
    stands behind the Gospel narrative, one need not be surprised if,
    in the second century, Jews did not think of questioning that
    assumption. It is certain, however, that some did question it. For
    Justin, in his Dialogue with Trypho, represents the Jew Trypho as
    saying, “ye follow an empty rumour and make a Christ for
    yourselves.” “If he was born and lived somewhere he is entirely
    unknown.”
    That the writers of the Talmud [4th-5th centuries CE, FRZ] had no
    independent knowledge of Jesus is proved by the fact that they
    confounded him with two different men neither of whom can have been
    he. Evidently no other Jesus with whom they could identify the
    Gospel Jesus was known to them. One of these, Jesus ben Pandira,
    reputed a wonder-worker, is said to have been stoned to death and
    then hung on a tree on the eve of a Passover in the reign of
    Alexander Jannæus (106-79 BC) at Jerusalem. The other, Jesus ben
    Stada, whose date is uncertain, but who may have lived in the first
    third of the second century CE, is also said to have been stoned
    and hanged on the eve of a Passover, but at Lydda. There may be
    some confusion here; but it is plain that the Rabbis had no
    knowledge of Jesus apart from what they had read in the
    Gospels.Citation 11
Although Christian apologists have listed a number of ancient
historians who allegedly were witnesses to the existence of Jesus, the
only two that consistently are cited are Josephus, a Pharisee, and
Tacitus, a pagan. Since Josephus was born in the year 37 CE, and
Tacitus was born in 55, neither could have been an eye-witness of
Jesus, who supposedly was crucified in 30 CE. So we could really end
our article here. But someone might claim that these historians
nevertheless had access to reliable sources, now lost, which recorded
the existence and execution of our friend JC. So it is desirable that
we take a look at these two supposed witnesses.
In the case of Josephus, whose Antiquities of the Jews was written in
93 CE, about the same time as the gospels, we find him saying some
things quite impossible for a good Pharisee to have said:
    About this time, there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought
    to call him a man. For he was one who wrought surprising feats and
    was a teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly. He won
    over many Jews and many of the Greeks. He was the Messiah. When
    Pilate, upon hearing him accused by men of the highest standing
    amongst us, had condemned him to be crucified, those who had in the
    first place come to love him did not give up their affection for
    him. On the third day he appeared to them restored to life, for the
    prophets of God had prophesied these and countless other marvelous
    things about him. And the tribe of the Christians, so called after
    him, has still to this day not disappeared.Citation 12
Now no loyal Pharisee would say Jesus had been the Messiah. That
Josephus could report that Jesus had been restored to life “on the
third day” and not be convinced by this astonishing bit of information
is beyond belief. Worse yet is the fact that the story of Jesus is
intrusive in Josephus’ narrative and can be seen to be an interpolation
even in an English translation of the Greek text. Right after the
wondrous passage quoted above, Josephus goes on to say, “About the same
time also another sad calamity put the Jews into disorder…” Josephus
had previously been talking about awful things Pilate had done to the
Jews in general, and one can easily understand why an interpolator
would have chosen this particular spot. But his ineptitude in not
changing the wording of the bordering text left a “literary seam” (what
rhetoricians might term aporia) that sticks out like a pimpled nose.
The fact that Josephus was not convinced by this or any other Christian
claim is clear from the statement of the church father Origen (ca.
185-ca. 154 CE) – who dealt extensively with Josephus – that Josephus
did not believe in Jesus as the Messiah, i.e., as “the Christ.”
Moreover, the disputed passage was never cited by early Christian
apologists such as Clement of Alexandria (ca.150-ca. 215 CE), who
certainly would have made use of such ammunition had he had it!
The first person to make mention of this obviously forged interpolation
into the text of Josephus’ history was the church father Eusebius, in
324 CE. It is quite likely that Eusebius himself did some of the
forging. As late as 891, Photius in his Bibliotheca, which devoted
three “Codices” to the works of Josephus, shows no awareness of the
passage whatsoever even though he reviews the sections of the
Antiquities in which one would expect the disputed passage to be found.
Clearly, the testimonial was absent from his copy of Antiquities of the
Jews.Citation 13 The question can probably be laid to rest by noting
that as late as the sixteenth century, according to Rylands,Citation 14
a scholar named Vossius had a manuscript of Josephus from which the
passage was wanting.
Apologists, as they grasp for ever more slender straws with which to
support their historical Jesus, point out that the passage quoted above
is not the only mention of Jesus made by Josephus. In Bk. 20, Ch. 9, §1
of Antiquities of the Jews one also finds the following statement in
surviving manuscripts:
    Ananus… convened the judges of the Sanhedrin and brought before
    them a man named James, the brother of Jesus who was called the
    Christ, and certain others. He accused them of having transgressed
    the law and delivered them up to be stoned.
It must be admitted that this passage does not intrude into the text as
does the one previously quoted. In fact, it is very well integrated
into Josephus’ story. That it has been modified from whatever Josephus’
source may have said (remember, here too, Josephus could not have been
an eye-witness) is nevertheless extremely probable. The crucial word in
this passage is the name James (Jacob in Greek and Hebrew). It is very
possible that this very common name was in Josephus’ source material.
It might even have been a reference to James the Just, a first-century
character we have good reason to believe indeed existed. Because he
appears to have born the title Brother of the Lord,Note H it would have
been natural to relate him to the Jesus character. It is quite possible
that Josephus actually referred to a James “the Brother of the Lord,”
and this was changed by Christian copyists (remember that although
Josephus was a Jew, his text was preserved only by Christians!) to
“Brother of Jesus” – adding then for good measure “who was called
According to William Benjamin Smith’s skeptical classic Ecce
Deus,Citation 15 there are still some manuscripts of Josephus which
contain the quoted passages, but the passages are absent in other
manuscripts – showing that such interpolation had already been taking
place before the time of Origen but did not ever succeed in supplanting
the original text universally.
Pagan Authors Before considering the alleged witness of Pagan authors,
it is worth noting some of the things that we should find recorded in
their histories if the biblical stories are in fact true. One passage
from Matthew should suffice to point out the significance of the
silence of secular writers:
    Matt. 27:45. Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all
    the land unto the ninth hour… Jesus, when he had cried again with a
    loud voice, yielded up the ghost. 51. And, behold, the veil of the
    temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth
    did quake, and the rocks rent; 52 And the graves were opened; and
    many bodies of the saints which slept arose, 53 And came out of the
    graves after his resurrection [exposed for 3 days?], and went into
    the holy city, and appeared unto many.
Wouldn’t the Greeks and Romans have noticed – and recorded – such
darkness occurring at a time of the month when a solar eclipse was
impossible? Wouldn’t someone have remembered – and recorded – the name
of at least one of those “saints” who climbed out of the grave and went
wandering downtown in the mall? If Jesus did anything of significance
at all, wouldn’t someone have noticed? If he didn’t do anything
significant, how could he have stimulated the formation of a new
Considering now the supposed evidence of Tacitus, we find that this
Roman historian is alleged in 120 CE to have written a passage in his
Annals (Bk 15, Ch 44, containing the wild tale of Nero’s persecution of
Christians) saying “Therefore, to scotch the rumour, Nero substituted
as culprits, and punished with the utmost refinements of cruelty, a
class of men, loathed for their vices, whom the crowd styled
Christians. Christus, the founder of the name, had undergone the death
penalty in the reign of Tiberius, by sentence of the procurator Pontius
Pilatus…” G.A. Wells [p. 16] says of this passage:
    [Tacitus wrote] at a time when Christians themselves had come to
    believe that Jesus had suffered under Pilate. There are three
    reasons for holding that Tacitus is here simply repeating what
    Christians had told him. First, he gives Pilate a title, procurator
    [without saying procurator of what! FRZ], which was current only
    from the second half of the first century. Had he consulted
    archives which recorded earlier events, he would surely have found
    Pilate there designated by his correct title, prefect. Second,
    Tacitus does not name the executed man Jesus, but uses the title
    Christ (Messiah) as if it were a proper name. But he could hardly
    have found in archives a statement such as “the Messiah was
    executed this morning.” Third, hostile to Christianity as he was,
    he was surely glad to accept from Christians their own view that
    Christianity was of recent origin, since the Roman authorities were
    prepared to tolerate only ancient cults. (The Historical Evidence
    for Jesus; p.16).
There are further problems with the Tacitus story. Tacitus himself
never again alludes to the Neronian persecution of Christians in any of
his voluminous writings, and no other Pagan authors know anything of
the outrage either. Most significant, however, is that ancient
Christian apologists made no use of the story in their propaganda – an
unthinkable omission by motivated partisans who were well-read in the
works of Tacitus. Clement of Alexandria, who made a profession of
collecting just such types of quotations, is ignorant of any Neronian
persecution, and even Tertullian, who quotes a great deal from Tacitus,
knows nothing of the story. According to Robert Taylor, the author of
another freethought classic, the Diegesis (1834), the passage was not
known before the fifteenth century, when Tacitus was first published at
Venice by Johannes de Spire. Taylor believed de Spire himself to have
been the forger.
So much for the evidence purporting to prove that Jesus was an
historical figure. We have not, of course, proved that Jesus did not
exist. We have only showed that all evidence alleged to support such a
claim is without substance. But of course, that is all we need to show.
The burden of proof is always on the one who claims that something
exists or that something once happened. We have no obligation to try to
prove a universal negative.Note J
It will be argued by die-hard believers that all my arguments “from
silence” prove nothing and they will quote the aphorism, “Absence of
evidence is not evidence of absence.” But is the negative evidence I
have referred to the same as absence of evidence? It might be
instructive to consider how a hypothetical but similar problem might be
dealt with in the physical sciences.
Imagine that someone has claimed that the USA had carried out atomic
weapons tests on a particular Caribbean island in 1943. Would the lack
of reports of mushroom-cloud sightings at the time be evidence of
absence, or absence of evidence? (Remember, the Caribbean during the
war years was under intense surveillance by many different factions.)
Would it be necessary to go to the island today to scan its surface for
the radioactive contamination that would have to be there if nuclear
explosions had taken place there? If indeed, we went there with our
Geiger-counters and found no trace of radioactive contamination, would
that be evidence of absence, or absence of evidence? In this case, what
superficially looks like absence of evidence is really negative
evidence, and thus legitimately could be construed as evidence of
absence. Can the negative evidence adduced above concerning Jesus be
very much less compelling?
It would be intellectually satisfying to learn just how it was that the
Jesus character condensed out of the religious atmosphere of the first
century. But scholars are at work on the problem. The publication of
many examples of so-called wisdom literature, along with the materials
from the Essene community by the Dead Sea and the Gnostic
literature from the Nag Hammadi library in Egypt, has given us a much
more detailed picture of the communal psychopathologies which infested
the Eastern Mediterranean world at the turn of the era. It is not
unrealistic to expect that we will be able, before long, to reconstruct
in reasonable detail the stages by which Jesus came to have a
biography. They Should Have Noticed
John E. Remsburg, in his classic book The Christ: A Critical Review and
Analysis of the Evidence of His Existence (The Truth Seeker Company,
NY, no date, pp. 24-25), lists the following writers who lived during
the time, or within a century after the time, that Jesus is supposed to
have lived: Josephus 	Juvenal 	Lucanus Philo-Judæus
Hermogones Silius Italicus Pliny Elder 	Plutarch 	Statius
Arrian 	Pliny Younger 	Ptolemy Petronius 	Tacitus
Paterculus 	Apollonius 	Phædrus Suetonius
Quintilian 	Valerius Maximus Pausanias 	Dio Chrysostom
Lucian 	Valerius Flaccus 	Appion of Alexandria
Quintius Curtius 	Damis 	Theon of Smyrna
Aulus Gellius 	Favorinus 	
According to Remsburg, “Enough of the writings of the authors named in
the foregoing list remains to form a library. Yet in this mass of
Jewish and Pagan literature, aside from two forged passages in the
works of a Jewish author, and two disputed passages in the works of
Roman writers, there is to be found no mention of Jesus Christ.” Nor,
we may add, do any of these authors make note of the Disciples or
Apostles – increasing the embarrassment from the silence of history
concerning the foundation of Christianity. Notes
    It is sometimes claimed that the “miraculous” spread of
    Christianity in the early Roman Empire is evidence of an historical
    Jesus – that such a movement could not have gone so far so fast had
    there not been a real person at its inception. A similar argument
    could be made, however, in the case of the earlier rapid spread of
    Mithraism. I am unaware of any Christian apologists who would argue
    that this supports the idea of an historical Mithra! A profusely
    annotated paperback edition of Paine’s book is available from
    American Atheist Press for twelve dollars. (Order No. 5575, click
    here) [back] An apocalypse is a pseudonymous piece of writing
    characterized by exaggerated symbolic imagery, usually dealing with
    the expectation of an imminent cosmic cataclysm wherein the deity
    destroys the wicked and rewards the righteous. Apocalyptic writing
    abounds in hidden meanings and numerological puzzles. Parts of a
    number of Judæo-Christian apocalypses other than Revelation have
    been preserved, but only the latter (if one does not consider the
    Book of Daniel to be entirely apocalyptic) was accepted into the
    Christian canon – and it almost didn’t make it, having been
    rejected by several early Church Fathers and Church Councils. The
    opposite theory, often referred to as “Griesbach’s hypothesis,”
    that the author of Mark had “epitomized” the two longer gospels,
    keeping only the “essential” details, is today almost entirely
    rejected by bible scholars. While the arguments to support this
    nearly universal rejection are too involved to even summarize here,
    it may be noted that shortening of miracle stories is completely
    out of keeping with the principles of religious development seen
    everywhere today. Stories invariably get “better” (i.e., longer)
    with the retelling, never shorter! There is compelling evidence
    indicating that these alleged sayings of Jesus were taken from
    another early document known as Q (German, for Quelle, ‘source’).
    Like the so-called Gospel of Thomas found at Nag Hammadi in Egypt,
    Q appears to have been a list of wisdom sayings that at some point
    became attributed to Jesus. We know that at least one of these
    sayings (“We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced…” Matt.
    17:11; Luke 7:32) derives from Æsop’s Fables, not from a sage of
    Galilee! I say “official gospels” because there are, in fact, many
    other gospels known. Once people started making them up, they sort
    of got stuck in over-drive. Only later on in Christian history did
    the number get pared back to four. Even the letters supposed to
    contain authentic writings of Saul/Paul have been shown by a number
    of scholars to be as composite as the gospels (e.g., L. Gordon
    Rylands, A Critical Analysis of the Four Chief Pauline Epistles:
    Romans, First and Second Corinthians, and Galatians, Watts & Co.,
    London, 1929). According to such analyses, the core Pauline
    material in these letters is what might be termed a pre-Christian
    Gnostic product. This material is surrounded by often contradictory
    material added by proto-Catholic interpolators and redactors who
    succeeded thus in claiming a popular proto-Gnostic authority for
    the Church of Rome. In any case, the Greek text of these letters is
    heavy with terms such as Archon, Æon, etc. – jargon terms popular
    in the more astrologically conscious forms of Gnosticism. It would
    appear that the Christ of Paul is as astral a being as the Lamb of
    Revelation. Like the god of Revelation, the god of Paul
    communicates via visions, not physically, face-to-face. Originally,
    this would have been the title born by a member of a religious
    fraternity associated with the worship of Yahweh, who in Greek was
    always referred to as kurios (‘Lord’). This was carried over into
    primitive Christianity, where we know from I Cor. 9:5 that there
    existed a governing class coordinate with apostles that was called
    “Brothers of the Lord.” Misunderstanding of the original meaning of
    the title led to the belief that Jesus had siblings – an error that
    can be found already in the earliest of the canonical gospels.
    Interestingly, the embarrassing passages in the gospels where Jesus
    is rude to his mother and brethren would seem to derive from a
    period where a political struggle had developed between
    apostolically governed sects and those governed by “Brethren of the
    Lord,” who claimed authority now by virtue of an alleged blood
    relationship to Jesus – who had by then supplanted Yahweh as
    “Lord.” The apostolic politics of the gospel writers could not
    resist putting down the Brethren Party by having Jesus disregard
    his own family. If Jesus didn’t pay serious attention to his own
    family, the argument would go, why should anyone pay attention to
    their descendants? This is the only plausible explanation for the
    presence of such passages as John 2:4 (“Woman, what have I to do
    with thee?”) or Mark 3:33 (“Who is my mother, or my brethren?).
    Latinists often dispute the possibility of the passage being a
    forgery on the grounds that Tacitus’ distinctive Latin style so
    perfectly permeates the entire passage. But it should be noted that
    the more distinctive a style might be, the easier it can be
    imitated. Then too, there is a lapse from normal Tacitean usage
    elsewhere in the disputed passage. In describing the early
    Christians as being haters “of the human race” (humani generis),
    the passage reverses the word order of normal Tacitean usage. In
    all other cases, Tacitus has generis humani. Curiously, in the
    present case, it would seem that such proof is in fact possible.
    Since Jesus is frequently referred to as “Jesus of Nazareth,” it is
    interesting to learn that the town now called Nazareth did not
    exist in the first centuries BCE and CE. Exhaustive archaeological
    studies have been done by Franciscans to prove the cave they
    possess was once the home of Jesus’ family. But actually they have
    shown the site to have been a necropolis – a city of the dead –
    during the first century CE. (Naturally, the Franciscans cannot
    agree!) With no Nazareth other than a cemetery existing at the
    time, how could there have been a Jesus of Nazareth? Without an Oz,
    could there have been a Wizard of Oz?

JESUS CHRIST - NO HISTORICAL EVIDENCE
IN ONE OF THE MOST CAREFULLY DOCUMENTED PERIODS OF ROMAN AND ANCIENT
HISTORY The time that Jesus Christ supposedly existed is one the most heavily
documented periods in ancient history.  Yet there is virtually zero
historical evidence of his supposed existence in any contemporary
historical record.  It is also important to understand that an absolute
reign of terror was instituted when Christianity seized power in the
Roman Empire as documented in our Christian Totalitarianism Report.
The Church appointed an official historian of dubious ethics, Eusebius,
to write an official history.  Meanwhile, Christian launched the
largest book burning campaign in history, destroying a vast part of the
wisdom and history of the ancient world forever. The Account of Josephus is a Fraud
When discussing the alleged existence of Jesus Christ, one piece of
"evidence" that frequently gets mentioned is the account of Flavius
Josephus, the famed Jewish general and historian who lived from 37 to
100 C.E. In Josephus's Antiquities of the Jews there is a notorious
passage regarding Christ called the "Testimonium Flavium."
"Now, there was about this time, Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to
call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works,--a teacher of
such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both
many of the Jews, and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ; and
when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had
condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not
forsake him, for he appeared to them alive again the third day, as the
divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful
things concerning him; and the tribe of Christians, so named from him,
are not extinct at this day." (Whitson, 379).
This brief piece of evidence which supposedly contributed the best
"proof" of Jesus's existence has actually been proven to be a fraud. It
has been demonstrated continuously over the centuries that "Testamonium
Flavium" was a forgery manufactured by the Catholic Church, and was
inserted into Josephus's works. The Testamonium Flavium account is so
thoroughly refuted, that biblical scholars since the 19th century have
refused to refer to it, unless to mention its false nature.
Dr. Gordon Stein gives a further explanation for this forgery. The
History of Jesus: A Reply to Josh McDowell.
Another source is The Jesus Forgery: Josephus Untangled.
First Written Accounts of Jesus's Life Occur Decades After His
Purported Existence
Most written accounts of the life of Jesus did not exist until a couple
decades after his purported existence. These accounts were presented by
a number of different authors and had somewhat conflicting stories
about his existence. These written accounts are known as the Gospels.
Also, it is worth knowing that not all of the gospels that were written
even made their way into the bible. Only four gospels became the
canonical writings for the church. The rest were burned, destroyed or
lost. Historians estimate that the first written gospel, the gospel of
Mark, was written sometime after 70 C.E, which means that at the
earliest, it would have been written 40 years after the alleged
crucifixion of Jesus.
PLINY, TACITUS AND SUETONIUS: NO PROOF OF JESUS
Nero's Persecution of Christians and Mention of Jesus is Highly Doubtful
There is widespread belief that Nero blamed the burning of Rome on the
Christians; however, there are many holes in this theory.
This belief comes from the account of the Roman historian Tacitus
(56-120 CE) about how Emperor Nero (37 - 68 CE) blamed the burning of
Rome on "those people who were abhorred for their crimes and commonly
called Christians." The passage then states that the fire agitators
were followers of "Christus" who "was put to death as a criminal by the
procurator Pontius Pilate." The passage then also states that
Christians constituted a "vast multitude at Rome" and goes on to
discuss the ghastly ways in which they were persecuted.
However, there are many troubling details about the historical accuracy
of this passage. Some critics call into question whether Tacitus wrote
this account at all, or if it was yet another forgery. Around the date
of Nero's Fire, 64 AD, there were no "multitude of Christians" in Rome.
At this time, there was not even a multitude of Christians in Judea.
Therefore, it is highly doubtful that Nero would refer to Christians in
this way.
This is also the only mention of Christians in the work of Tacitus,
despite the fact that he wrote several volumes
Also, the supposed persecution of the Christians by Nero is not
recorded by any other historian of Nero's time. If the persecution of
Christians were really that widespread, wouldn't other historians be
writing about it? (Truth Be Known)
Pliny's Letter About "Christiani"
In addition to the Testomonium Flavianum, there exists another tenuous
piece of evidence that some have tried to use as proof for the
existence of Jesus. The Roman Historian, Pliny The Younger (62-113CE),
wrote a letter to the Emperor Trajan in 110 CE requesting his
assistance in the proper punishment of a group of "Christiani" who were
causing trouble and would not bow to the image of the emperor.
According to Pliny, these Christiani would meet before daylight and
sing hymns with responses to "Christ as God."
However, this letter does not provide concrete evidence for the
existence of Jesus as a person since it makes no direct mention of
"Jesus of Nazareth," nor does it refer to his life. Also, there are
many critics who have argued that this letter is a forgery. (Truth Be
Suetonius's Reference to "Chresto"
The last piece of questionable historical evidence we'll discuss here
is the passage in Suetonius's Life of Claudius, dating around 110 CE.
There is a reference in this work to a figure named "Chresto" who
caused the Jews to riot in Rome. First of all, if Jesus Christ did
exist, it is not possible that he would have been in Rome at this time.

This article written by former Interim President and current member of
the Board of Directors Frank Zindler and is reprinted from the Summer
1998 edition of American Atheist magazine.
    I have taken it for granted that Jesus of Nazareth existed. Some
    writers feel a need to justify this assumption at length against
    people who try from time to time to deny it. It would be easier,
    frankly, to believe that Tiberius Caesar, Jesus’ contemporary, was
    a figment of the imagination than to believe that there never was
    such a person as Jesus. – N. T. Wright, Jesus and the Victory of
    God (Fortress, 1996)
For most of my life, I had taken it for granted that Jesus, although
certainly not a god, was nevertheless an historical personage – perhaps
a magician skilled in hypnosis. To be sure, I knew that some of the
world’s greatest scholars had denied his existence. Nevertheless, I had
always more or less supposed that it was improbable that so many
stories could have sprung up about someone who had never existed. Even
in the case of other deities, such as Zeus, Thor, Isis, and Osiris, I
had always taken it for granted that they were merely deified human
heroes: men and women who lived in the later stages of prehistory –
persons whose reputations got better and better the longer the time
elapsed after their deaths. Gods, like fine wines, I supposed, improved
with age.
About a decade ago, however, I began to reexamine the evidence for the
historicity of Jesus. I was astounded at what I didn’t find. In this
article, I would like to show how shaky the evidence is regarding the
alleged existence of a would-be messiah named Jesus. I now feel it is
more reasonable to suppose he never existed. It is easier to account
for the facts of early Christian history if Jesus were a fiction than
if he once were real. Burden of Proof
Although what follows may fairly be interpreted to be a proof of the
non-historicity of Jesus, it must be realized that the burden of proof
does not rest upon the skeptic in this matter. As always is the case,
the burden of proof weighs upon those who assert that some thing or
some process exists. If someone claims that he never has to shave
because every morning before he can get to the bathroom he is assaulted
by a six-foot rabbit with extremely sharp teeth who trims his whiskers
better than a razor – if someone makes such a claim, no skeptic need
worry about constructing a disproof. Unless evidence for the claim is
produced, the skeptic can treat the claim as false. This is nothing
more than sane, every-day practice.
Unlike N. T. Wright, quoted at the beginning of this article, a small
number of scholars have tried over the centuries to prove that Jesus
was in fact historical. It is instructive, when examining their
“evidence,” to compare it to the sort of evidence we have, say, for the
existence of Tiberius Cæsar – to take up the challenge made by Wright.
It may be conceded that it is not surprising that there are no coins
surviving from the first century with the image of Jesus on them.
Unlike Tiberius Cæsar and Augustus Cæsar who adopted him, Jesus is not
thought to have had control over any mints. Even so, we must point out
that we do have coins dating from the early first century that bear
images of Tiberius that change with the age of their subject. We even
have coins minted by his predecessor, Augustus Cæsar, that show
Augustus on one side and his adopted son on the other.Citation 1 Would
Mr. Wright have us believe that these coins are figments of the
imagination? Can we be dealing with fig-mints?
Statues that can be dated archaeologically survive to show Tiberius as
a youth, as a young man assuming the toga, as Cæsar, etc.Citation 2
Engravings and gems show him with his entire family.Citation 3
Biographers who were his contemporaries or nearly so quote from his
letters and decrees and recount the details of his life in minute
detail.Citation 4 There are contemporary inscriptions all over the
former empire that record his deeds.Citation 5 There is an ossuary of
at least one member of his family, and the Greek text of a speech made
by his son Germanicus has been found at Oxyrhynchus in Egypt.Citation 6
And then there are the remains of his villa on Capri. Nor should we
forget that Augustus Cæsar, in his Res Gestæ (“Things Accomplished”),
which survives both in Greek and Latin on the so-called Monumentum
Ancyranum, lists Tiberius as his son and co-ruler.Citation 7
Is there anything advocates of an historical Jesus can produce that
could be as compelling as this evidence for Tiberius? I think not, and
I thank N. T. Wright for making a challenge that brings this disparity
so clearly to light.
There is really only one area where evidence for Jesus is even claimed
to be of a sort similar to that adduced for Tiberius – the area of
biographies written by contemporaries or near contemporaries.Note A It
is sometimes claimed that the Christian Bible contains such evidence.
Sometimes it is claimed that there is extrabiblical evidence as well.
Let us then examine this would-be evidence. The Old Testament “Evidence”
Let us consider the so-called biblical evidence first. Despite the
claims of Christian apologists, there is absolutely nothing in the Old
Testament (OT) that is of relevance to our question, apart from the
possible fact that some prophets may have thought that an “anointed
one” (a rescuer king or priest) would once again assume the leadership
of the Jewish world. All of the many examples of OT “predictions” of
Jesus are so silly that one need only look them up to see their
irrelevance. Thomas Paine, the great heretic of the American
Revolution, did just that, and he demonstrated their irrelevance in his
book An Examination of the Prophecies, which he intended to be Part III
of The Age of Reason.Note B The New Testament “Evidence”
The elimination of the OT leaves only the New Testament (NT) “evidence”
and extrabiblical material to be considered. Essentially, the NT is
composed of two types of documents: letters and would-be biographies
(the so-called gospels). A third category of writing, apocalyptic,Note
C of which the Book of Revelation is an example, also exists, but it
gives no support for the historicity of Jesus. In fact, it would appear
to be an intellectual fossil of the thought-world from which
Christianity sprang – a Jewish apocalypse that was reworked for
Christian use.Citation 8 The main character of the book (referred to 28
times) would seem to be “the Lamb,” an astral being seen in visions (no
claims to historicity here!), and the book overall is redolent of
ancient astrology.Citation 9
The name Jesus occurs only seven times in the entire book, Christ only
four times, and Jesus Christ only twice! While Revelation may very well
derive from a very early period (contrary to the views of most biblical
scholars, who deal with the book only in its final form), the Jesus of
which it whispers obviously is not a man. He is a supernatural being.
He has not yet acquired the physiological and metabolic properties of
which we read in the gospels. The Jesus of Revelation is a god who
would later be made into a man – not a man who would later become a
god, as liberal religious scholars would have it. The Gospels
The notion that the four “gospels that made the cut” to be included in
the official New Testament were written by men named Matthew, Mark,
Luke, and John does not go back to early Christian times. The titles
“According to Matthew,” etc., were not added until late in the second
century. Thus, although Papias ca. 140 CE (‘Common Era’) knows all the
gospels but has only heard of Matthew and Mark, Justin Martyr (ca. 150
CE) knows of none of the four supposed authors. It is only in 180 CE,
with Irenæus of Lyons, that we learn who wrote the four “canonical”
gospels and discover that there are exactly four of them because there
are four quarters of the earth and four universal winds. Thus, unless
one supposes the argument of Irenæus to be other than ridiculous, we
come to the conclusion that the gospels are of unknown origin and
authorship, and there is no good reason to suppose they are eye-witness
accounts of a man named Jesus of Nazareth. At a minimum, this forces us
to examine the gospels to see if their contents are even compatible
with the notion that they were written by eye-witnesses. We cannot even
assume that each of the gospels had but one author or redactor.
It is clear that the gospels of Matthew and Luke could not possibly
have been written by an eye-witness of the tales they tell. Both
writers plagiarizeNote D (largely word-for-word) up to 90% of the
gospel of Mark, to which they add sayings of Jesus e and would-be
historical details. Ignoring the fact that Matthew and Luke contradict
each other in such critical details as the genealogy of Jesus – and
thus cannot both be correct – we must ask why real eye-witnesses would
have to plagiarize the entire ham-hocks-and-potatoes of the story,
contenting themselves with adding merely a little gravy, salt, and
pepper. A real eye-witness would have begun with a verse reading, “Now,
boys and girls, I’m gonna tell you the story of Jesus the Messiah the
way it really happened…” The story would be a unique creation. It is
significant that it is only these two gospels that purport to tell
anything of Jesus’ birth, childhood, or ancestry. Both can be dismissed
as unreliable without further cause. We can know nothing of Jesus’
childhood or origin! Mark
But what about the gospel of Mark, the oldest surviving gospel?
Attaining essentially its final form probably as late as 90 CE but
containing core material dating possibly as early as 70 CE, it omits,
as we have seen, almost the entire traditional biography of Jesus,
beginning the story with John the Baptist giving Jesus a bath, and
ending – in the oldest manuscripts – with women running frightened from
the empty tomb. (The alleged postresurrection appearances reported in
the last twelve verses of Mark are not found in the earliest
manuscripts, even though they are still printed in most modern bibles
as though they were an “authentic” part of Mark’s gospel.) Moreover,
“Mark” being a non-Palestinian non-disciple, even the skimpy historical
detail he provides is untrustworthy.
To say that Mark’s account is “skimpy” is to understate the case. There
really isn’t much to the gospel of Mark, the birth legends,
genealogies, and childhood wonders all being absent. Whereas the gospel
of Luke takes up 43 pages in the New English Bible, the gospel of Mark
occupies only 25 pages – a mere 58% as much material! Stories do indeed
grow with the retelling.
I have claimed that the unknown author of Mark was a non-Palestinian
non-disciple, which would make his story mere hearsay. What evidence do
we have for this assertion? First of all, Mark shows no first-hand
understanding of the social situation in Palestine. He is clearly a
foreigner, removed both in space and time from the events he alleges.
For example, in Mark 10:12, he has Jesus say that if a woman divorces
her husband and marries another, she commits adultery. As G. A. Wells,
the author of The Historical Evidence for JesusCitation 10 puts it,
    Such an utterance would have been meaningless in Palestine, where
    only men could obtain divorce. It is a ruling for the Gentile
    Christian readers… which the evangelist put into Jesus’ mouth in
    order to give it authority. This tendency to anchor later customs
    and institutions to Jesus’ supposed lifetime played a considerable
    role in the building up of his biography.
One further evidence of the inauthenticity of Mark is the fact that in
chapter 7, where Jesus is arguing with the Pharisees, Jesus is made to
quote the Greek Septuagint version of Isaiah in order to score his
debate point. Unfortunately, the Hebrew version says something
different from the Greek. Isaiah 29:13, in the Hebrew reads “their fear
of me is a commandment of men learned by rote,” whereas the Greek
version – and the gospel of Mark – reads “in vain do they worship me,
teaching as doctrines the precepts of men” [Revised Standard Version).
Wells observes dryly [p. 13], “That a Palestinian Jesus should floor
Orthodox Jews with an argument based on a mistranslation of their
scriptures is very unlikely.” Indeed!
Another powerful argument against the idea that Mark could have been an
eye-witness of the existence of Jesus is based upon the observation
that the author of Mark displays a profound lack of familiarity with
Palestinian geography. If he had actually lived in Palestine, he would
not have made the blunders to be found in his gospel. If he never lived
in Palestine, he could not have been an eye-witness of Jesus. You get
the point.
The most absurd geographical error Mark commits is when he tells the
tall tale about Jesus crossing over the Sea of Galilee and casting
demons out of a man (two men in Matthew’s revised version) and making
them go into about 2,000 pigs which, as the King James version puts it,
“ran violently down a steep place into the sea… and they were choked in
the sea.”
Apart from the cruelty to animals displayed by the lovable, gentle
Jesus, and his disregard for the property of others, what’s wrong with
this story? If your only source of information is the King James Bible,
you might not ever know. The King James says this marvel occurred in
the land of the Gadarenes, whereas the oldest Greek manuscripts say
this miracle took place in the land of the Gerasenes. Luke, who also
knew no Palestinian geography, also passes on this bit of absurdity.
But Matthew, who had some knowledge of Palestine, changed the name to
Gadarene in his new, improved version; but this is further improved to
Gergesenes in the King James version.
By now the reader must be dizzy with all the distinctions between
Gerasenes, Gadarenes, and Gergesenes. What difference does it make? A
lot of difference, as we shall see.
Gerasa, the place mentioned in the oldest manuscripts of Mark, is
located about 31 miles from the shore of the Sea of Galilee! Those poor
pigs had to run a course five miles longer than a marathon in order to
find a place to drown! Not even lemmings have to go that far. Moreover,
if one considers a “steep” slope to be at least 45 degrees, that would
make the elevation of Gerasa at least six times higher than Mt. Everest!
When the author of Matthew read Mark’s version, he saw the
impossibility of Jesus and the gang disembarking at Gerasa (which, by
the way, was also in a different country, the so-called Decapolis).
Since the only town in the vicinity of the Sea of Galilee that he knew
of that started with G was Gadara, he changed Gerasa to Gadara. But
even Gadara was five miles from the shore – and in a different country.
Later copyists of the Greek manuscripts of all three pig-drowning
gospels (Matthew, Mark, and Luke) improved Gadara further to Gergesa, a
region now thought to have actually formed part of the eastern shore of
the Sea of Galilee. So much for the trustworthiness of the biblical
Another example of Mark’s abysmal ignorance of Palestinian geography is
found in the story he made up about Jesus traveling from Tyre on the
Mediterranean to the Sea of Galilee, 30 miles inland. According to Mark
7:31, Jesus and the boys went by way of Sidon, 20 miles north of Tyre
on the Mediterranean coast! Since to Sidon and back would be 40 miles,
this means that the wisest of all men walked 70 miles when he could
have walked only 30. Of course, one would never know all this from the
King James version which – apparently completely ignoring a perfectly
clear Greek text – says “Departing from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon,
he came unto the Sea of Galilee…” Apparently the translators of the
King James version also knew their geography. At least they knew more
than did the author of Mark! John
The unreliability of the gospels is underscored when we learn that,
with the possible exception of John, the first three gospels bear no
internal indication of who wrote them. Can we glean anything of
significance from the fourth and latest gospel, the gospel of John? Not
likely! It is so unworldly, it can scarcely be cited for historical
evidence. In this account, Jesus is hardly a man of flesh and blood at
all – except for the purposes of divine cannibalism as required by the
celebration of the rite of “holy communion.”
“In the beginning was the word, and the word was with god, and the word
was god,” the gospel begins. No Star of Bethlehem, no embarrassment of
pregnant virgins, no hint that Jesus ever wore diapers: pure spirit
from the beginning. Moreover, in its present form, the gospel of John
is the latest of all the official gospels.[Note F]
The gospel of John was compiled around the year 110 CE. If its author
had been 10 years old at the time of Jesus’ crucifiction in the year 30
CE, he would have been 80 years old at the time of writing. Not only is
it improbable that he would have lived so long, it is dangerous to pay
much attention to the colorful “memories” recounted by a man in his
“anecdotage.” Many of us who are far younger than this have had the
unpleasant experience of discovering incontrovertible proof that what
we thought were clear memories of some event were wildly incorrect. We
also might wonder why an eye-witness of all the wonders claimed in a
gospel would wait so long to write about them!
More importantly, there is evidence that the Gospel of John, like
Matthew and Luke, also is a composite document, incorporating an
earlier “Signs Gospel” of uncertain antiquity. Again, we ask, if “John”
had been an eye-witness to Jesus, why would he need to plagiarize a
list of miracles made up by someone else? Nor is there anything in the
Signs Gospel that would lead one to suppose that it was an eye-witness
account. It could just as easily have been referring to the wonders of
Dionysus turning water into wine, or to the healings of Asclepius.
The inauthenticity of the Gospel of John would seem to be established
beyond cavil by the discovery that the very chapter that asserts the
author of the book to have been “the disciple whom Jesus loved” [John
21:20] was a late addition to the gospel. Scholars have shown that the
gospel originally ended at verses 30-31 of Chapter 20. Chapter 21 – in
which verse 24 asserts that “This is the disciple which testifieth of
these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is
true” – is not the work of an eye-witness. Like so many other things in
the Bible, it is a fraud. The testimony is not true. Saint Saul And His
Having eliminated the OT and the gospels from the list of possible
biblical “evidences” of the existence of Jesus, we are left with the
so-called epistles.
At first blush, we might think that these epistles – some of which are
by far the oldest parts of the NT, having been composed at least 30
years before the oldest gospel – would provide us with the most
reliable information on Jesus. Well, so much for blushes. The oldest
letters are the letters of St. Saul – the man who, after losing his
mind, changed his name to Paul. Before going into details, we must
point out right away, before we forget, that St. Saul’s testimony can
be ignored quite safely, if what he tells us is true, namely, that he
never met Jesus “in the flesh,” but rather saw him only in a vision he
had during what appears to have been an epileptic seizure. No court of
law would accept visions as evidence, and neither should we.
The reader might object that even if Saul only had hearsay evidence,
some of it might be true. Some of it might tell us some facts about
Jesus. Well, allright. Let’s look at the evidence.
According to tradition, 13 of the letters in the NT are the work of St.
Saul. Unfortunately, Bible scholars and computer experts have gone to
work on these letters, and it turns out that only four can be shown to
be substantially by the same author, putatively Saul. g These are the
letters known as Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Galatians. To these
probably we may add the brief note to Philemon, a slave-owner,
Philippians, and 1 Thessalonians. The rest of the so-called Pauline
epistles can be shown to have been written by other and later authors,
so we can throw them out right now and not worry about them.
Saul tells us in 2 Corinthians 11:32 that King Aretas of the Nabateans
tried to have him arrested because of his Christian agitation. Since
Aretas is known to have died in the year 40 CE, this means that Saul
became a Christian before that date. So what do we find out about Jesus
from a man who had become a Christian less than ten years after the
alleged crucifixion? Precious little!
Once again, G.A. Wells, in his book The Historical Evidence for Jesus
[pp. 22-23], sums things up so succinctly, that I quote him verbatim:
    The…Pauline letters…are so completely silent concerning the events
    that were later recorded in the gospels as to suggest that these
    events were not known to Paul, who, however, could not have been
    ignorant of them if they had really occurred. These letters have no
    allusion to the parents of Jesus, let alone to the virgin birth.
    They never refer to a place of birth (for example, by calling him
    ‘of Nazareth’). They give no indication of the time or place of his
    earthly existence. They do not refer to his trial before a Roman
    official, nor to Jerusalem as the place of execution. They mention
    neither John the Baptist, nor Judas, nor Peter’s denial of his
    master. (They do, of course, mention Peter, but do not imply that
    he, any more than Paul himself, had known Jesus while he had been
    alive.)
    These letters also fail to mention any miracles Jesus is supposed
    to have worked, a particularly striking omission, since, according
    to the gospels, he worked so many.
    Another striking feature of Paul’s letters is that one could never
    gather from them that Jesus had been an ethical teacher… on only
    one occasion does he appeal to the authority of Jesus to support an
    ethical teaching which the gospels also represent Jesus as having
    delivered.
It turns out that Saul’s appeal to the authority of Jesus involves
precisely the same error we found in the gospel of Mark. In 1 Cor.
7:10, Saul says that “not I but the Lord, [say] that the wife should
not separate from the husband.” That is, a wife should not seek
divorce. If Jesus had actually said what Saul implies, and what Mark
10:12 claims he said, his audience would have thought he was nuts – as
the Bhagwan says – or perhaps had suffered a blow to the head. So much
for the testimony of Saul. His Jesus is nothing more than the thinnest
hearsay, a legendary creature which was crucified as a sacrifice, a
creature almost totally lacking a biography. Extrabiblical “Evidence”
So far we have examined all the biblical evidences alleged to prove the
existence of Jesus as an historical figure. We have found that they
have no legitimacy as evidence. Now we must examine the last line of
would-be evidence, the notion that Jewish and pagan historians recorded
his existence. Jewish Sources
It is sometimes claimed that Jewish writings hostile to Christianity
prove that the ancient Jews knew of Jesus and that such writings prove
the historicity of the man Jesus. But in fact, Jewish writings prove no
such thing, as L. Gordon Rylands’ book Did Jesus Ever Live? pointed out
nearly seventy years ago:
    …all the knowledge which the Rabbis had of Jesus was obtained by
    them from the Gospels. Seeing that Jews, even in the present more
    critical age, take it for granted that the figure of a real man
    stands behind the Gospel narrative, one need not be surprised if,
    in the second century, Jews did not think of questioning that
    assumption. It is certain, however, that some did question it. For
    Justin, in his Dialogue with Trypho, represents the Jew Trypho as
    saying, “ye follow an empty rumour and make a Christ for
    yourselves.” “If he was born and lived somewhere he is entirely
    unknown.”
    That the writers of the Talmud [4th-5th centuries CE, FRZ] had no
    independent knowledge of Jesus is proved by the fact that they
    confounded him with two different men neither of whom can have been
    he. Evidently no other Jesus with whom they could identify the
    Gospel Jesus was known to them. One of these, Jesus ben Pandira,
    reputed a wonder-worker, is said to have been stoned to death and
    then hung on a tree on the eve of a Passover in the reign of
    Alexander Jannæus (106-79 BC) at Jerusalem. The other, Jesus ben
    Stada, whose date is uncertain, but who may have lived in the first
    third of the second century CE, is also said to have been stoned
    and hanged on the eve of a Passover, but at Lydda. There may be
    some confusion here; but it is plain that the Rabbis had no
    knowledge of Jesus apart from what they had read in the
    Gospels.Citation 11
Although Christian apologists have listed a number of ancient
historians who allegedly were witnesses to the existence of Jesus, the
only two that consistently are cited are Josephus, a Pharisee, and
Tacitus, a pagan. Since Josephus was born in the year 37 CE, and
Tacitus was born in 55, neither could have been an eye-witness of
Jesus, who supposedly was crucified in 30 CE. So we could really end
our article here. But someone might claim that these historians
nevertheless had access to reliable sources, now lost, which recorded
the existence and execution of our friend JC. So it is desirable that
we take a look at these two supposed witnesses.
In the case of Josephus, whose Antiquities of the Jews was written in
93 CE, about the same time as the gospels, we find him saying some
things quite impossible for a good Pharisee to have said:
    About this time, there lived Jesus, a wise man, if indeed one ought
    to call him a man. For he was one who wrought surprising feats and
    was a teacher of such people as accept the truth gladly. He won
    over many Jews and many of the Greeks. He was the Messiah. When
    Pilate, upon hearing him accused by men of the highest standing
    amongst us, had condemned him to be crucified, those who had in the
    first place come to love him did not give up their affection for
    him. On the third day he appeared to them restored to life, for the
    prophets of God had prophesied these and countless other marvelous
    things about him. And the tribe of the Christians, so called after
    him, has still to this day not disappeared.Citation 12
Now no loyal Pharisee would say Jesus had been the Messiah. That
Josephus could report that Jesus had been restored to life “on the
third day” and not be convinced by this astonishing bit of information
is beyond belief. Worse yet is the fact that the story of Jesus is
intrusive in Josephus’ narrative and can be seen to be an interpolation
even in an English translation of the Greek text. Right after the
wondrous passage quoted above, Josephus goes on to say, “About the same
time also another sad calamity put the Jews into disorder…” Josephus
had previously been talking about awful things Pilate had done to the
Jews in general, and one can easily understand why an interpolator
would have chosen this particular spot. But his ineptitude in not
changing the wording of the bordering text left a “literary seam” (what
rhetoricians might term aporia) that sticks out like a pimpled nose.
The fact that Josephus was not convinced by this or any other Christian
claim is clear from the statement of the church father Origen (ca.
185-ca. 154 CE) – who dealt extensively with Josephus – that Josephus
did not believe in Jesus as the Messiah, i.e., as “the Christ.”
Moreover, the disputed passage was never cited by early Christian
apologists such as Clement of Alexandria (ca.150-ca. 215 CE), who
certainly would have made use of such ammunition had he had it!
The first person to make mention of this obviously forged interpolation
into the text of Josephus’ history was the church father Eusebius, in
324 CE. It is quite likely that Eusebius himself did some of the
forging. As late as 891, Photius in his Bibliotheca, which devoted
three “Codices” to the works of Josephus, shows no awareness of the
passage whatsoever even though he reviews the sections of the
Antiquities in which one would expect the disputed passage to be found.
Clearly, the testimonial was absent from his copy of Antiquities of the
Jews.Citation 13 The question can probably be laid to rest by noting
that as late as the sixteenth century, according to Rylands,Citation 14
a scholar named Vossius had a manuscript of Josephus from which the
passage was wanting.
Apologists, as they grasp for ever more slender straws with which to
support their historical Jesus, point out that the passage quoted above
is not the only mention of Jesus made by Josephus. In Bk. 20, Ch. 9, §1
of Antiquities of the Jews one also finds the following statement in
surviving manuscripts:
    Ananus… convened the judges of the Sanhedrin and brought before
    them a man named James, the brother of Jesus who was called the
    Christ, and certain others. He accused them of having transgressed
    the law and delivered them up to be stoned.
It must be admitted that this passage does not intrude into the text as
does the one previously quoted. In fact, it is very well integrated
into Josephus’ story. That it has been modified from whatever Josephus’
source may have said (remember, here too, Josephus could not have been
an eye-witness) is nevertheless extremely probable. The crucial word in
this passage is the name James (Jacob in Greek and Hebrew). It is very
possible that this very common name was in Josephus’ source material.
It might even have been a reference to James the Just, a first-century
character we have good reason to believe indeed existed. Because he
appears to have born the title Brother of the Lord,Note H it would have
been natural to relate him to the Jesus character. It is quite possible
that Josephus actually referred to a James “the Brother of the Lord,”
and this was changed by Christian copyists (remember that although
Josephus was a Jew, his text was preserved only by Christians!) to
“Brother of Jesus” – adding then for good measure “who was called
According to William Benjamin Smith’s skeptical classic Ecce
Deus,Citation 15 there are still some manuscripts of Josephus which
contain the quoted passages, but the passages are absent in other
manuscripts – showing that such interpolation had already been taking
place before the time of Origen but did not ever succeed in supplanting
the original text universally.
Pagan Authors Before considering the alleged witness of Pagan authors,
it is worth noting some of the things that we should find recorded in
their histories if the biblical stories are in fact true. One passage
from Matthew should suffice to point out the significance of the
silence of secular writers:
    Matt. 27:45. Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all
    the land unto the ninth hour… Jesus, when he had cried again with a
    loud voice, yielded up the ghost. 51. And, behold, the veil of the
    temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom; and the earth
    did quake, and the rocks rent; 52 And the graves were opened; and
    many bodies of the saints which slept arose, 53 And came out of the
    graves after his resurrection [exposed for 3 days?], and went into
    the holy city, and appeared unto many.
Wouldn’t the Greeks and Romans have noticed – and recorded – such
darkness occurring at a time of the month when a solar eclipse was
impossible? Wouldn’t someone have remembered – and recorded – the name
of at least one of those “saints” who climbed out of the grave and went
wandering downtown in the mall? If Jesus did anything of significance
at all, wouldn’t someone have noticed? If he didn’t do anything
significant, how could he have stimulated the formation of a new
Considering now the supposed evidence of Tacitus, we find that this
Roman historian is alleged in 120 CE to have written a passage in his
Annals (Bk 15, Ch 44, containing the wild tale of Nero’s persecution of
Christians) saying “Therefore, to scotch the rumour, Nero substituted
as culprits, and punished with the utmost refinements of cruelty, a
class of men, loathed for their vices, whom the crowd styled
Christians. Christus, the founder of the name, had undergone the death
penalty in the reign of Tiberius, by sentence of the procurator Pontius
Pilatus…” G.A. Wells [p. 16] says of this passage:
    [Tacitus wrote] at a time when Christians themselves had come to
    believe that Jesus had suffered under Pilate. There are three
    reasons for holding that Tacitus is here simply repeating what
    Christians had told him. First, he gives Pilate a title, procurator
    [without saying procurator of what! FRZ], which was current only
    from the second half of the first century. Had he consulted
    archives which recorded earlier events, he would surely have found
    Pilate there designated by his correct title, prefect. Second,
    Tacitus does not name the executed man Jesus, but uses the title
    Christ (Messiah) as if it were a proper name. But he could hardly
    have found in archives a statement such as “the Messiah was
    executed this morning.” Third, hostile to Christianity as he was,
    he was surely glad to accept from Christians their own view that
    Christianity was of recent origin, since the Roman authorities were
    prepared to tolerate only ancient cults. (The Historical Evidence
    for Jesus; p.16).
There are further problems with the Tacitus story. Tacitus himself
never again alludes to the Neronian persecution of Christians in any of
his voluminous writings, and no other Pagan authors know anything of
the outrage either. Most significant, however, is that ancient
Christian apologists made no use of the story in their propaganda – an
unthinkable omission by motivated partisans who were well-read in the
works of Tacitus. Clement of Alexandria, who made a profession of
collecting just such types of quotations, is ignorant of any Neronian
persecution, and even Tertullian, who quotes a great deal from Tacitus,
knows nothing of the story. According to Robert Taylor, the author of
another freethought classic, the Diegesis (1834), the passage was not
known before the fifteenth century, when Tacitus was first published at
Venice by Johannes de Spire. Taylor believed de Spire himself to have
been the forger.
So much for the evidence purporting to prove that Jesus was an
historical figure. We have not, of course, proved that Jesus did not
exist. We have only showed that all evidence alleged to support such a
claim is without substance. But of course, that is all we need to show.
The burden of proof is always on the one who claims that something
exists or that something once happened. We have no obligation to try to
prove a universal negative.Note J
It will be argued by die-hard believers that all my arguments “from
silence” prove nothing and they will quote the aphorism, “Absence of
evidence is not evidence of absence.” But is the negative evidence I
have referred to the same as absence of evidence? It might be
instructive to consider how a hypothetical but similar problem might be
dealt with in the physical sciences.
Imagine that someone has claimed that the USA had carried out atomic
weapons tests on a particular Caribbean island in 1943. Would the lack
of reports of mushroom-cloud sightings at the time be evidence of
absence, or absence of evidence? (Remember, the Caribbean during the
war years was under intense surveillance by many different factions.)
Would it be necessary to go to the island today to scan its surface for
the radioactive contamination that would have to be there if nuclear
explosions had taken place there? If indeed, we went there with our
Geiger-counters and found no trace of radioactive contamination, would
that be evidence of absence, or absence of evidence? In this case, what
superficially looks like absence of evidence is really negative
evidence, and thus legitimately could be construed as evidence of
absence. Can the negative evidence adduced above concerning Jesus be
very much less compelling?
It would be intellectually satisfying to learn just how it was that the
Jesus character condensed out of the religious atmosphere of the first
century. But scholars are at work on the problem. The publication of
many examples of so-called wisdom literature, along with the materials
from the Essene community by the Dead Sea and the Gnostic
literature from the Nag Hammadi library in Egypt, has given us a much
more detailed picture of the communal psychopathologies which infested
the Eastern Mediterranean world at the turn of the era. It is not
unrealistic to expect that we will be able, before long, to reconstruct
in reasonable detail the stages by which Jesus came to have a
biography. They Should Have Noticed
John E. Remsburg, in his classic book The Christ: A Critical Review and
Analysis of the Evidence of His Existence (The Truth Seeker Company,
NY, no date, pp. 24-25), lists the following writers who lived during
the time, or within a century after the time, that Jesus is supposed to
have lived: Josephus 	Juvenal 	Lucanus Philo-Judæus
Hermogones Silius Italicus Pliny Elder 	Plutarch 	Statius
Arrian 	Pliny Younger 	Ptolemy Petronius 	Tacitus
Paterculus 	Apollonius 	Phædrus Suetonius
Quintilian 	Valerius Maximus Pausanias 	Dio Chrysostom
Lucian 	Valerius Flaccus 	Appion of Alexandria
Quintius Curtius 	Damis 	Theon of Smyrna
Aulus Gellius 	Favorinus 	
According to Remsburg, “Enough of the writings of the authors named in
the foregoing list remains to form a library. Yet in this mass of
Jewish and Pagan literature, aside from two forged passages in the
works of a Jewish author, and two disputed passages in the works of
Roman writers, there is to be found no mention of Jesus Christ.” Nor,
we may add, do any of these authors make note of the Disciples or
Apostles – increasing the embarrassment from the silence of history
concerning the foundation of Christianity. Notes
    It is sometimes claimed that the “miraculous” spread of
    Christianity in the early Roman Empire is evidence of an historical
    Jesus – that such a movement could not have gone so far so fast had
    there not been a real person at its inception. A similar argument
    could be made, however, in the case of the earlier rapid spread of
    Mithraism. I am unaware of any Christian apologists who would argue
    that this supports the idea of an historical Mithra! A profusely
    annotated paperback edition of Paine’s book is available from
    American Atheist Press for twelve dollars. (Order No. 5575, click
    here) [back] An apocalypse is a pseudonymous piece of writing
    characterized by exaggerated symbolic imagery, usually dealing with
    the expectation of an imminent cosmic cataclysm wherein the deity
    destroys the wicked and rewards the righteous. Apocalyptic writing
    abounds in hidden meanings and numerological puzzles. Parts of a
    number of Judæo-Christian apocalypses other than Revelation have
    been preserved, but only the latter (if one does not consider the
    Book of Daniel to be entirely apocalyptic) was accepted into the
    Christian canon – and it almost didn’t make it, having been
    rejected by several early Church Fathers and Church Councils. The
    opposite theory, often referred to as “Griesbach’s hypothesis,”
    that the author of Mark had “epitomized” the two longer gospels,
    keeping only the “essential” details, is today almost entirely
    rejected by bible scholars. While the arguments to support this
    nearly universal rejection are too involved to even summarize here,
    it may be noted that shortening of miracle stories is completely
    out of keeping with the principles of religious development seen
    everywhere today. Stories invariably get “better” (i.e., longer)
    with the retelling, never shorter! There is compelling evidence
    indicating that these alleged sayings of Jesus were taken from
    another early document known as Q (German, for Quelle, ‘source’).
    Like the so-called Gospel of Thomas found at Nag Hammadi in Egypt,
    Q appears to have been a list of wisdom sayings that at some point
    became attributed to Jesus. We know that at least one of these
    sayings (“We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced…” Matt.
    17:11; Luke 7:32) derives from Æsop’s Fables, not from a sage of
    Galilee! I say “official gospels” because there are, in fact, many
    other gospels known. Once people started making them up, they sort
    of got stuck in over-drive. Only later on in Christian history did
    the number get pared back to four. Even the letters supposed to
    contain authentic writings of Saul/Paul have been shown by a number
    of scholars to be as composite as the gospels (e.g., L. Gordon
    Rylands, A Critical Analysis of the Four Chief Pauline Epistles:
    Romans, First and Second Corinthians, and Galatians, Watts & Co.,
    London, 1929). According to such analyses, the core Pauline
    material in these letters is what might be termed a pre-Christian
    Gnostic product. This material is surrounded by often contradictory
    material added by proto-Catholic interpolators and redactors who
    succeeded thus in claiming a popular proto-Gnostic authority for
    the Church of Rome. In any case, the Greek text of these letters is
    heavy with terms such as Archon, Æon, etc. – jargon terms popular
    in the more astrologically conscious forms of Gnosticism. It would
    appear that the Christ of Paul is as astral a being as the Lamb of
    Revelation. Like the god of Revelation, the god of Paul
    communicates via visions, not physically, face-to-face. Originally,
    this would have been the title born by a member of a religious
    fraternity associated with the worship of Yahweh, who in Greek was
    always referred to as kurios (‘Lord’). This was carried over into
    primitive Christianity, where we know from I Cor. 9:5 that there
    existed a governing class coordinate with apostles that was called
    “Brothers of the Lord.” Misunderstanding of the original meaning of
    the title led to the belief that Jesus had siblings – an error that
    can be found already in the earliest of the canonical gospels.
    Interestingly, the embarrassing passages in the gospels where Jesus
    is rude to his mother and brethren would seem to derive from a
    period where a political struggle had developed between
    apostolically governed sects and those governed by “Brethren of the
    Lord,” who claimed authority now by virtue of an alleged blood
    relationship to Jesus – who had by then supplanted Yahweh as
    “Lord.” The apostolic politics of the gospel writers could not
    resist putting down the Brethren Party by having Jesus disregard
    his own family. If Jesus didn’t pay serious attention to his own
    family, the argument would go, why should anyone pay attention to
    their descendants? This is the only plausible explanation for the
    presence of such passages as John 2:4 (“Woman, what have I to do
    with thee?”) or Mark 3:33 (“Who is my mother, or my brethren?).
    Latinists often dispute the possibility of the passage being a
    forgery on the grounds that Tacitus’ distinctive Latin style so
    perfectly permeates the entire passage. But it should be noted that
    the more distinctive a style might be, the easier it can be
    imitated. Then too, there is a lapse from normal Tacitean usage
    elsewhere in the disputed passage. In describing the early
    Christians as being haters “of the human race” (humani generis),
    the passage reverses the word order of normal Tacitean usage. In
    all other cases, Tacitus has generis humani. Curiously, in the
    present case, it would seem that such proof is in fact possible.
    Since Jesus is frequently referred to as “Jesus of Nazareth,” it is
    interesting to learn that the town now called Nazareth did not
    exist in the first centuries BCE and CE. Exhaustive archaeological
    studies have been done by Franciscans to prove the cave they
    possess was once the home of Jesus’ family. But actually they have
    shown the site to have been a necropolis – a city of the dead –
    during the first century CE. (Naturally, the Franciscans cannot
    agree!) With no Nazareth other than a cemetery existing at the
    time, how could there have been a Jesus of Nazareth? Without an Oz,
    could there have been a Wizard of Oz?

In 1802, Humphry Davy used what he described as "a battery of immense
size",[13] consisting of 2,000 cells housed in the basement of the
Royal Institution of Great Britain,[14] to create an incandescent light
by passing the current through a thin strip of platinum, chosen because
the metal had an extremely high melting point. It was not bright enough
nor did it last long enough to be practical, but it was the precedent
behind the efforts of scores of experimenters over the next 75
Over the first three-quarters of the 19th century many experimenters
worked with various combinations of platinum or iridium wires, carbon
rods, and evacuated or semi-evacuated enclosures. Many of these devices
were demonstrated and some were patented.[16]
In 1835, James Bowman Lindsay demonstrated a constant electric light at
a public meeting in Dundee, Scotland. He stated that he could "read a
book at a distance of one and a half feet". However, having perfected
the device to his own satisfaction, he turned to the problem of
wireless telegraphy and did not develop the electric light any further.
His claims are not well documented, although he is credited in
Challoner et al. with being the inventor of the "Incandescent Light
In 1838, Belgian lithographer Marcellin Jobard invented an incandescent
light bulb with a vacuum atmosphere using a carbon filament.[18]
In 1840, British scientist Warren de la Rue enclosed a coiled platinum
filament in a vacuum tube and passed an electric current through it.
The design was based on the concept that the high melting point of
platinum would allow it to operate at high temperatures and that the
evacuated chamber would contain fewer gas molecules to react with the
platinum, improving its longevity. Although a workable design, the cost
of the platinum made it impractical for commercial use.
In 1841, Frederick de Moleyns of England was granted the first patent
for an incandescent lamp, with a design using platinum wires contained
within a vacuum bulb. He also used carbon.[19][20]
In 1845, American John W. Starr acquired a patent for his incandescent
light bulb involving the use of carbon filaments.[21][22] He died
shortly after obtaining the patent, and his invention was never
produced commercially. Little else is known about him.[23]
In 1851, Jean Eugène Robert-Houdin publicly demonstrated incandescent
light bulbs on his estate in Blois, France. His light bulbs are on
display in the museum of the Château de Blois.[24]
In 1872, Russian Alexander Lodygin invented an incandescent light bulb
and obtained a Russian patent in 1874. He used as a burner two carbon
rods of diminished section in a glass receiver, hermetically sealed,
and filled with nitrogen, electrically arranged so that the current
could be passed to the second carbon when the first had been
consumed.[25] Later he lived in the US, changed his name to Alexander
de Lodyguine and applied and obtained patents for incandescent lamps
having chromium, iridium, rhodium, ruthenium, osmium, molybdenum and
tungsten filaments,[26] and a bulb using a molybdenum filament was
demonstrated at the world fair of 1900 in Paris.[27]
Heinrich Göbel in 1893 claimed he had designed the first incandescent
light bulb in 1854, with a thin carbonized bamboo filament of high
resistance, platinum lead-in wires in an all-glass envelope, and a high
vacuum. Judges of four courts raised doubts about the alleged Göbel
anticipation, but there was never a decision in a final hearing due to
the expiry date of Edison's patent. A research work published 2007
concluded that the story of the Göbel lamps in the 1850s is a
legend.[28]

Then came a big monster of an ambulance which took me from
Liverpool to Watertown and delivered me to a white-coated Army staff. A
young nurse volunteered to make me comfortable with a glass of orange
juice, to relieve my thirst, but at the bottom of the orange juice I saw an
unmistakable layer of undissolved white crystalline solids. I wasn't going
to be hoodwinked by a bunch of soldiers! The juice was obviously a
sophisticated cover-up for the administration of some dramatic sedative
or presurgical anesthetic which was expected to render me placid and
unconcerned about the medical procedures they had planned for me.
I resolved to prove my masculinity and control of the situation by
simply denying the white crystals their power. I would drink the whole
mixture down, but I would stay awake and alert. I would be wheeled into
the surgical bay as an attentive sailor who would challenge the Army
surgeons with analytical perception and penetrating questions which would
reveal to them the integrity of my mental status.
It didn't work. The drug that rested undissolved under my orange
juice was undeniably a pretty effective drug, because I succumbed to it
and went completely unconscious. I have no memory of the intravenous
Pentothal anesthetic that was administered to me for my surgery. And I
was later told of the unprecedented half-hour I required for recovery from
The bone infection was surgically removed, and to this day my left
thumb is almost a half-inch shorter than my right.
.....Eventually I healed, and had to become reoriented to military reality, but in the mean-
time I had learned a couple of facts.
....The second fact was not expected at all, and it was this that
started me on my career as a psychopharmacologist. I was told that the
white "drug" which was undissolved at the bottom of my orange juice
glass, and which had finally plopped me over the line from being an
alert and defensive surgery candidate to being a comatose subject
available to any and all manipulation by the operating physician, was
nothing but undissolved sugar.
A fraction of a gram of sugar had rendered me unconscious, because I
had truly believed that it could do just that. The power of a simple placebo
to radically alter my state of consciousness impressed me deeply. The contribution of the mind to the observed action of a drug was certainly
real, and I decided it was possible that this contribution was a major one.
Over the intervening years, I have come to believe that the mind is the
major factor in defining a psychoactive drug's action. One has been taught
to assign the power of a drug to the drug itself, without considering the
person into whom it goes. A drug by itself can be a powder, a spoonful of
sugar, without any curative value whatsoever. But there is a personal
reality of the recipient of the drug that plays a major role in the definition
of the eventual interaction. Each of us has his own reality, and each of us
will construct his own unique drug-person relationship.

unconcerned about the medical procedures they had planned for me.
I resolved to prove my masculinity and control of the situation by
simply denying the white crystals their power. I would drink the whole
mixture down, but I would stay awake and alert. I would be wheeled into
the surgical bay as an attentive sailor who would challenge the Army
surgeons with analytical perception and penetrating questions which would
reveal to them the integrity of my mental status.
It didn't work. The drug that rested undissolved under my orange
juice was undeniably a pretty effective drug, because I succumbed to it
and went completely unconscious. I have no memory of the intravenous
Pentothal anesthetic that was administered to me for my surgery. And I
was later told of the unprecedented half-hour I required for recovery from
The bone infection was surgically removed, and to this day my left
thumb is almost a half-inch shorter than my right.
.....Eventually I healed, and had to become reoriented to military reality, but in the mean-
time I had learned a couple of facts.
....The second fact was not expected at all, and it was this that
started me on my career as a psychopharmacologist. I was told that the
white "drug" which was undissolved at the bottom of my orange juice
glass, and which had finally plopped me over the line from being an
alert and defensive surgery candidate to being a comatose subject
available to any and all manipulation by the operating physician, was
nothing but undissolved sugar.
A fraction of a gram of sugar had rendered me unconscious, because I
had truly believed that it could do just that. The power of a simple placebo
to radically alter my state of consciousness impressed me deeply. The contribution of the mind to the observed action of a drug was certainly
real, and I decided it was possible that this contribution was a major one.
Over the intervening years, I have come to believe that the mind is the
major factor in defining a psychoactive drug's action. One has been taught
to assign the power of a drug to the drug itself, without considering the
person into whom it goes. A drug by itself can be a powder, a spoonful of
sugar, without any curative value whatsoever. But there is a personal
reality of the recipient of the drug that plays a major role in the definition
of the eventual interaction. Each of us has his own reality, and each of us
will construct his own unique drug-person relationship.

well if the cheap sci-fi scenario with a benevolent super 'AI'

  the last thing they want is to give up their power.   but the idea that stupid humans are going to create a super human
  benvolent god is so very...stupid...and, surprise surprise, it is the
  same kind of garbage found in joo-kristianity. The 'benevolent' 'god'
  guiding the sheep, making the sheep happy bla bla.
  yeah, and AI simply means image recognition and similar techniques
  applied to other areas of surveillance.   I don't think better weather forecasting, if at all possible,
  requires any 'intelligence'. It's just a matter of more accurate
  simulation of basic physics.  Likewise there isn't any real
  'intelligence' involved in more fucked up or more 'efficient'  systems
  of surveillance.   in other words "artificial intelligence" is "marketing bullshit"
  om the other hand, the 'transhumanist' 'movement' is a threat that is
  a lot more real than 'ai'. What 'transhumanism' boils down to is the
  supreme scum of the planet (mentioned above) being able to buy some
  sort of 'inmortality'. So  there won't be any 'artificial'
  intelligence, but the pseudo-intelligent predators from google and
  goldman sachs would morph into a mix of animals with machine
  extensions and control over all the 'automatic' garbage that makes
  joe six pack's life so 'amazing'.   also as more stuff gets 'automated' it may make sense for the

  answered?   But just for you : yes, they can find all the 'intelligence' they want
  to frame anybody for any 'crime'. Among other things.   ...
   oh sure, they don't know how       so you are in the cpunks mailing list telling people that they are
    tin foil hat wearing crazies because they think govt surveillance
    is a real serious threat.
    and you think using jargon from the supreme scum of the earth, the

Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or about 12KB per day.  Only people trying to create new coins would need to run network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with that one node.
The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.
If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal. Satoshi Nakamoto

(I forgot to send this reply sooner)   not surprising I guess. A quick look at that page makes my head hurt.   So that may  be a good excuse for them to build more jails.   increasing the number of judges and other associated criminal
   parasites may be harder, for bureaucratic reasons I'd
  guess, so that may be a bottleneck for the system.   still your idea seems to depend on two assumptions   1) people would be let off if the state can't judge them (dubious I'd
  say)
  2) enough people will demand a trial. And why? Because you offer them
  $3000?  So, they don't plead 'guilty', they get a trial and they get
  3 times the sentence? That is still a big risk. Getting $3000
  inflated dollars doesn't cover that risk at all it seems.   your idea can only work IF enough people don't plead guilty AND the
  state doesn't just keep them in jail waiting for a trial.
  I don't think the part about getting enough people to cooperate can
  be solved by offering them $3000.

but isn't that pretty much the basis of the whole system?   either confess to whatever they accuse you of, or they will add 5 new
  charges?   so you can confess to, say, smoking pot, and get two years, or you
  can go to trial for "smoking pot while being near a gun' and that will
  get you 20 years. You might win at the trial but the chances are
  (very) low and the stakes a lot higher.   I'd assume that's not "vindicative sentencing" because in the later
  case they are charging you with 'real crimes' and you are getting a
  'fair' trial.    yes, though I just realized I overlooked the calculation/got it
   wrong. If you have 10 millions and distribute them among 5000 people
   that's 2000 per person. I was thinking the $3000 figure came from 10
   millions divided by 70,000 people. So got a zero in math.    bottom line is, as far as I understand it, pleading not guilty is a
   high risk gamble and it doesn't look as if getting $3000 or
   $30000 or even $300000 is a reasonale price for risking say 10 MORE    years in jail.    so recapitulating : if a number of people agree to cooperate and
   demand a trial (even with no money incentive) that can throw a wrench
   in the system BUT the coordination required to do that seems to be a
   literal case of the so called prisioner's dilemma.    then, on the other hand, the bureaucratic 'legal' procedure may play
   a crucial role here. If people can plead not guilty but then change
   their mind then it may be possible for them to see if they can
   reach a big enouhg number to be effective?

Is that the case? Seems to me that prosecutors have the discretion to
  do whatever they want. Just like jefferson and washington founded a
  slave society. All 100& perfectly 'legal'. By definition. Their own
  definition, upheld by their guns.
  Also, I haven't researched it yet, but seems that this complete
  travesty of extorting confessions has been going on for a long time,
  if not since 1776 or before that?
  Anyway, I'd certainly call the process of extorting confessions   'vindictive sentencing' just like I call taxation theft, but I doubt
  the government would admit what they actually do.
  And that step is?   I'm not following. I was just describing how the system works in
  practice. Confess or go to trial for more fake charges you can't
  fight. I wasn't talking about what would happen under your system,
  but about what happens now. In order to highlight what the
  'incentives' for prisioners are.   yeah but there's no appeal here?   Again, you are charged with A, confess, get a 'benign' sentence.   OR   You are charged with A, don't confess, get then charged with A + B +
  C, and then get your first (way longer) sentence.   That's how the USA 'justice' system works (at all levels if I
  understand correctly) so it must be 'legal'.
        So unless you've actually jammed the court system, pleading not
        guilty IS still a high risk gamble.
  I  looked at a couple of articles. Here's a case
   so  200,000,000 times 0.04 = 8,000,000    8,000,000 / 4000 = that's 2000 per person.    Again, do you think 4000 people would risk way longer sentences
   for $2000....? Either I am missing something obvious or you are...
  ONLY if the people who plead not guilty are able to plead guilty
  later and avoid longer sentences.    That's not what I'm talking about. I'm referring to the
   details/timing  of the 'legal' procedure dictated by the state.

likely that Big Brother will know what the proles are talking about, less
likely that participants in a plan will be targetted for investigation and

"If Pablo Escobar could defend himself with guns, why did he need crypto in

of the older participants in the battles, and e) those who are interested
in our topics have mostly already found us (meaning, the rich hunting
period is over). ;
This has an obvious answer. Guns are a last resort. Crypto makes it less
likely that Big Brother will know what the proles are talking about, less
likely that participants in a plan will be targetted for investigation and
Wei, your question could be paraphrased this way:
"If Pablo Escobar could defend himself with guns, why did he need crypto in
his cellphone?"
(The answer being that P. Escobar was detected by using a cellphone without
security. The NSA then told the DEA and its allies where he was and they
took him out on a rooftop.)
Final comment: If I find the motivation, I may finish an essay I've been
working on about how we, the Cypherpunks and the World, are *retrogressing*
in crypto areas. Most of the exotic applications are no longer being
discussed, and various mundane commercial products are the main focus. Yawn.

"I don't give a shit about the power structure -- I just think
that anyone telling me what I can and cannot see, what I can and
cannot write, and what I can and cannot sell, is my enemy." that's an interesting quote of course cause metzger is the same asshole
who tells people what they can or cannot write in 'his' mailing list.
a form of fascist censorship that you coincidentally support, right?

J. Eric Townsend says:
This is silly. Its like saying "I'm not in favor of banning guns --
but I want victims to be able to sue the gun manufacturers for
negligence". Dworkin is a fascist in feminist clothing -- for all
intents and purposes she believes that any act of heterosexual sex is
on some level rape. She's nuts.
This white male het computer geek marches in the Gay Pride Parade
every year. (Well, not this year -- I was sick. Mea culpa.) He also
thinks that Andrea Dworkin is about as anti-censorship as Rev.
Wildmon. I don't give a shit about the power structure -- I just think
that anyone telling me what I can and cannot see, what I can and
cannot write, and what I can and cannot sell, is my enemy.

here's a guy called craig wright, also known as 'satoshi nakamoto'  (LMAO!!!)
the points he makes are quite interesting : his and the bloomberg-journo-asshole's criticism of the lightning network is that LN users(nodes) would be 'unlicensed money transmitters' and so would be doing 'illegal money laundering'.
'satoshi nakamoto' then rants against even more people who are 'redesigning' bitcoin to be 'illegal', that is have some privacy built in.  "I'm going to shut them down with SV". "We are going to take legal action" et cetera. No doubt that the guy is Real Libertarian.
It should be mentioned that  wright or 'satoshi nakamoto'(LMAO!!!) used to be a buddy of roger ver's but ver has finally disowned him.
