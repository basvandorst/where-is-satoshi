There are many alternative tor hidden drug-free markets portals that work
well and use bitcoins/litecoins, Silk Road Market was just the biggest one.
Regarding "Bitcoin image" vs. Silk Road, BTC is falling down significantly because of Silk Road market shutdown. From this point of view as a bitcoin
owner, I am just loosing a lot of money :(
(and this is the second time why I am loosing my money because of FBI/CIA actions, the first time it was because of megaupload.com shutdown, of course
I had paid my megaupload lifetime subscription).

There are hundreds cases they did really nasty things.

together with the artistic group Satori, we have finished and released Visual Digital Freedom Manifesto  text description is here It is a realtime visual contemporary-art demo written in _pure_ Javascript with optional WebGL support (it took many people few months to develop it). Original goal was to make a pure company commercial demo (we do IT security), but finally it ended up more like a cryptoanarchistic project.
Yesterday we released this demo at NVScene 2014 (the biggest US demo party in San Jose) with the following feedback We were inspired by Second Realm (Book on Strategy)
and The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto
Enjoy 4 minutes of awesome visualizations,

@_subject: Paralelni Polis Congress (cryptoanarchist conference) 9-12.10.2014 
it would be my pleasure to invite all of you to a unique cryptoanarchist conference - Parallel Polis Congress that will take place during 9-12.10.2014 in Prague / Central Europe.
* Parallel Polis in theory
Parallel Polis is a theoretical concept developed by Czech dissident Vaclav
Benda (1942–1999) during the height of communist domination in Czechoslovakia
in the 1970s. It was translated into English in 1978.
Benda argues that in a repressed state, it is impossible to overturn corrupt
social, economic and political institutions. Such efforts are futile.
Instead, he suggests the creation of new "parallel institutions" that are more
responsible to human needs.
* Parallel Polis in practice
We were impressed by the concept of Vaclav Benda’s Parallel Polis and
Timothy C May’s Crypto Anarchistic Manifesto and Cyphernomicon.
Embracing the current crypto-technologies we have realized a practical
feasibility of these utopian theories and started a unique freedom think tank
focused on the promotion of digital freedom, cryptocurrencies, anonymization
networks and free markets.
For this purpose we decided to rent a big 3-floor house (with almost 1000m2)
in the center of Prague (Holešovice) - one floor dedicated to Bitcoin
coffee-house, hub and hackerspace called Institute of Cryptoanarchy. :)
* Founders of Parallel Polis
Parallel polis is 100% state-free project, based on voluntary contributions only of our members and donors.
Founding members are people from Czech contemporary-art group Ztohoven ( see their recent projects Moral Reform (hack of Czech Parliament)  and Citizen K and group of cryptoanarchists from Czech and Slovak hackerspaces.
* When & Where
Parallel Polis Congress takes place in Parallel Polis building (Dělnická 43, Prague) during 9-12.10.2014.
If you prefer to take public transport, take the tram number 1, 12, 14, 25, 53 or 54 to the tram station Dělnická.
* Parallel Polis Congress and why we need you!
Parallel Polis Congress is an opening party of a new era of our freedom. If you want to participate on this event as a speaker, please let me know -
if your presentation is interesting, we can cover you all travelling and accommodation expenses (including plane tickets from US). In the case of interest, also please send me:
+ the name of your presentation
+ a short description of your presentation (you can have a 30-minutes long
presentation with 10 minutes for Q/A or 5-10 minutes lightning talk)
+ your PGP or S/MIME key if you prefer encrypted communication
* Stay in touch
Thanks a lot and see you in Prague!
