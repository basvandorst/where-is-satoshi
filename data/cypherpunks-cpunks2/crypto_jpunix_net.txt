Hello Everyone!
It appears that Bitcoin Armory, supposedly one of the most secure Bitcoin wallets isn't so secure after all. Check out this forum post for more details.

@_subject: New XMPP servers 
Hash: SHA1
Hello Everyone!
For those that are using secure XMPP clients (Jitsi and the like) I'd
like to announce two new Prosody servers. Both are located in the
Netherlands and are available for public use. If you would like to try
them out they are located at chat.jpunix.net and chat.cpunk.us. Both
are fully-featured. Give them a try if you're so inclined!

You're very welcome! Just to be sure, I run chat.jpunix.net.
chat.cpunk.us is a sister site that is under different management.

@_subject: Help me test =?UTF-8?Q?Alpha=3F?= 
Hello Everyone!
If you would like to help test alpha.jpunix.net I'd be willing to set up a FREE email account for you. Please note that the account is NOT anonymous unless you take the necessary precautions! Just contact me directly if you are interested.
* SSL 4096 RSA/SHA512 certificate with PFS enabled. Please note this is a self-signed certificate that is for encryption only.
* POP3/IMAP supported - same caveats as above.
* SpamAssassin learning SPAM filter
* Optional YubiKey Authentication
* Optional Google Authenticator 2FA authentication
* Roundcube web interface
If you have any questions or comments please let me know. As I said this is *NOT* anonymous! It's up to you to take the necessary precautions!

For the time being I'm not offering my site as a bonafide service. I'm
just testing private mail solutions. The test server is NOT anonymous
as previously mentioned (anonymity is up to the user to
define/create). The server is located in Amsterdam and is hosted by
Digital Ocean. DO's corporate office is on U.S. soil so as to whether
LEO's can request the archived emails from an account is debatable. As
it stands I'm just offering it as a free service to anyone that would
like to help me test my personal service.
While we're on the subject, based on comments from a few people from
this list that have subscribed I've updated the following:
* Modified the server so that connections using older, insecure
protocols has been disabled (RC4 and such)
* PFS is now supported for IMAP
* SpamAssassin will "learn" SPAM outside of the web browser. For
instance if you are using Thunderbird with IMAP and you move a SPAM
message to the Junk folder SA will "learn" about it.

Hello Everyone!
     About once a week I go in search of TOR hidden services that may be
of interest to me. I found one this morning that I think is really
great! I purchased a Ebook reader a couple of weeks ago and have been
looking for sites to download books on the cheap (free). I found The
Reading Room this morning at  I
don't usually promote ANY website but I think whoever did this site
deserves a pat on the back (or a donation). I downloaded several Ebooks
with no problems.
     Pardon my posting this if you are offended but I'm SO happy to find
a website that will help feed my Ebook addiction!
