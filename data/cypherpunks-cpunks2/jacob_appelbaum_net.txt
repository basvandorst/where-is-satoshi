There are quite a few news articles and most of them have focused on the
iPhone backdoor known as DROPOUTJEEP - they largely miss the big picture
asserting that the NSA needs physical access. This is a
misunderstanding. The way that the NSA and GCHQ compromise devices with
QUANTUMNATION does not require physical access - that is merely one way
to compromise an iPhone. Generally the NSA and GCHQ compromise the phone
through the network using QUANTUM/QUANTUMNATION/QUANTUMTHEORY related
attack capabilities.
An example of a vulnerable Apple user is shown:
"note: QUANTUMNATION and standard QUANTUM tasking results in the same
exploitation technique. The main difference is QUANTUNATION deploys a
state 0 implant and is able to be submitted by the TOPI. Any ios device
will always get VALIDATOR deployed."
They're not talking about Cisco in that slide, I assure you.

The QUANTUM programs are extremely powerful but largely because our

to fix their products rather than sabotaging American companies?
