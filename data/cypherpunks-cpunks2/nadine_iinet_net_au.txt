 It's not anymore about 'should encrypt by default'... continuing
 to give yourselves the lazy fallback excuse of oppurtunistic crypto
 and waiting for someone else to do it. It's not anymore about asking
 your masters for permission to do what is not regulated today, or
 giving them seats and chance to muddle / dictate your protocols
 before they're developed / deployed.
 It's about 'must encrypt' and turning plaintext completely off NOW!
 It's about telling all the lazy oppurtunistic fiber tapping passive
 surveillors, (who are today breaking fundamental inalienable human
 rights not just regulations, and without asking first)... to FUCK
 OFF! This is not a time to play nice and compromise... it's war,
 one which they started against you. So deploy your crypto now, far
 and wide, and faster than the enemy can respond. Mass internet
 entrenchment has a winning history against subsequent fiat.
 We won the first crypto war, now it's time to win the second one.
 Flip the crypto switch, from off to on. Don't ask, don't tell, just
 do it.
 Mail providers and web services... turn plaintext off!
 Banks, schools, utilities, blogs, socialnets, OS distributions,
 user applications... the public facing, used by the public, whole
 lot of you... everyone, everywhere... just turn plaintext off!
 All plaintext transports over the internet... OFF!
 Even decentralized P2P applications such as chat / filesharing apps
 that wish no model using CA certs, can still enforce crypto by
 skipping cert checking under self-signed certs or using [EC]DHE
 style crypto session negotiation.
 There's no lack of capability or support among all these internet
 facing services and apps used by the general public anymore. Every
 OS / library can deal with TLS 1.0+ or key negotiation for that.
 And you don't need some grand crypto scheme that you all love to
 pontificate in endless circles about right now either. Just turn
 the damn plaintext OFF and tell everyone to go read the FAQ and
 update their end if they can't connect. Then worry about your pie
 in the sky later. It doesn't have to be perfect, all you need to
 do is shift the game from taking cheap passive global wire
 up the ass, to requiring more expensive targeted active attacks.
 Simply turning off the plaintext does that, it's a huge win!
  And while you're at it, set up a nonprofit CA foundation to issue
 free certs and get it added to the Mozilla and MS cert stores
 specifically for the purpose of accomplishing 'plaintext off'. CA's
 are useless profiteers who couldn't authenticate their own ass as
 customers anyways, and cert stores are uselessly bloated with both
 them and enemy entities... so just give the damn certs away to
 anyone who can publish a proof of ownership flag / TLS cert on the
 forward reference to their own services... simply to quiet
 warnings Nice to see something like this just dropped as I write:
  Pick July 4 2015 as the day to disable plaintext, since by then
 everything worth anything will support TLS 1.2 / good negotiation
 parameters, and it's a fitting meme.
 And if you don't like that flag, hoist another one...
  Now quit reading, making excuses and waiting... the enemy will just
 stomp all over your flag. Go get started on your code, updates and
 crypto configs... you've got a flag day to make.

@_subject: Free speech - front lines in Australia - 
freedom of speech does not protect hate speechand that is what 18c
which Bernard supports being removed.
He is free to say
"I wouldn't let a gay person teach my children and I am not afraid to
say it," a Twitter post from Mr Gaynor read.
but there is a line and that is what 18c is about.
He is free to be a dick in private. Clearly with his being dismissed
he has trouble with what private is.
 >>Bernard Gaynor is a controversial Australian with conservative
 pro-family views whom some would say is ultra-conservative, to which
 would counter "that's just your post-modern moral relativism which
 dominates the current Western public and social dialogue".
 So, notwithstanding anyone's particular views on any particular issue
 which Bernard Gaynor stands for and champions (at least one of which
 strongly disagree with), his stand for freedom of speech is superb,
 courageous, persistent, and thyankfully a following has formed which
 donates to keep him and his family afloat in the face of the legal
 and the many personal sacrifices he has chosen to make, and some
 he has and continues to suffer at the hands of his opponents,
 the chief of the Australian Army who stepped down to an early
 in "moral disgrace" and knowing that he would not survive his very
 political attack against Bernard Gaynor's personal stands as an
 Australian Army reserve man (he sacked Bernard amongst other things).
 So plenty to debate, but the guts of this is free speech and the long
 standing statutory infractions against our right to freedom of
 and in particular as we name it for necessary but quirky reasons in
 Australia for legal and constitutional purposes:
 freedom to communicate on political and related matters
 Good luck Bernard,

 From: Bernard Gaynor  To: Zenaan Harkiss  Reply-To: Bernard Gaynor  Subject: Update: battle for free speech
 View this email in your browser
  Dear Zenaan,
 Contents
 * Free Speech Update (
 * Fundraising Dinner (
 * Please help - donate $1 per week today (
 Since I last wrote to you on 22 August, there has been plenty of
 in the battle to speak the truth and speak it freely.
 First of all, I must thank all those who donated to assist in this
 battle. I incurred over $23,000 in fees last month. There is simply
 way that I could afford to wage this fight without your support. I am
 deeply grateful and humble for that assistance.
 Secondly, the New South Wales Supreme Court of Appeal held a
 Hearing on 31 August. The court room was packed and there was
 room only. I counted at least 18 barristers and solicitors there. The
 Commonwealth has intervened and so has the state of New South Wales.
 This matter is attracting high levels of attention, even if the media
 are not paying any interest (yet).
 Importantly, the Court accepted an amendment to our summons that we
 obtain a:
 Declaration that sections 49ZS and 49ZT of the Anti-Discrimination
 (NSW) 1977 are invalid in that they impair the Plaintiff's right to
 freedom of political communication or impair his freedom of religion
 under Constitution section 116.
 I have been busy this week preparing submissions and other
 to support our case. Obviously, I will not discuss our arguments in
 detail here and will respectfully leave them for the consideration of
 the New South Wales Supreme Court of Appeal.
 The matter has been set down for hearing in November. Suffice to say
 that a victory against the Anti-Discrimination Act (NSW) 1977 will
 very serious ramifications for all other anti-discrimination laws,
 including S18C of the Racial Discrimination Act (Cth) 1975. In other
 words, the outcome of this case may well destroy anti-free speech
 before the politicians in parliament ever get around to repealing
 As such, when it comes to free speech, this battle is the number one
 game in town. And let's all hope that it is successful. Australians
 should not be forced to apologise for their conservative views on
 and morality. I, for one, won't.
 Thirdly, the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal held a
 Case Conference yesterday and decided to proceed with an additional 8
 complaints against me from Garry Burns, even though these matters are
 before the New South Wales Supreme Court of Appeal and even though
 Tribunal has already determined that there is no jurisdiction under
 South Wales anti-discrimination law to lodged complaints against
 in Queensland.
 Don't ask me to explain the logic here. I can't. But the matter has
 set for another Case Conference on 14 December 2016.
 As far as I am concerned, the Tribunal and the Anti-Discrimination
 below it are acting far beyond their powers. However, I will deal
 that issue after the main game, which is the action in the Court of
 Appeal.
 I was very grateful for the support I received at a fundraising
 held at the Coorparoo RSL on 27 August. Robyn Sully did a tremendous
 organising it and nearly 100 people attended.
 We are now in the early stages of planning to organise other such
 dinners across Australia. From the feedback received, attendees found
 a very good way of understanding these matters and their importance.
 From my perspective, it was an extremely effective way of getting
 particular story out and explaining to Australians how all of us are
 affected by totalitarian laws that seek to target conservative
 beliefs.
 If you are interested in attending the next dinner in Brisbane it

There is also a difference between publicly stating an opinion and

likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or
intimidate another person [2] or a group of people; and

Section 46P of the _Australian Human Rights Commission Act

Commission about unlawful acts. However, an unlawful act is not
necessarily a criminal offence. Section 26 says that this Act does
not make it an offence to do an act that is unlawful because of this
Part, unless Part IV expressly says that the act is an offence.
an act is taken not to be done in private if it:

 * Free Speech Update (
 * Fundraising Dinner (
 * Please help - donate $1 per week today (
 Since I last wrote to you on 22 August, there has been plenty of
 in the battle to speak the truth and speak it freely.
 First of all, I must thank all those who donated to assist in this
 battle. I incurred over $23,000 in fees last month. There is simply
 way that I could afford to wage this fight without your support. I am
 deeply grateful and humble for that assistance.
 Secondly, the New South Wales Supreme Court of Appeal held a
 Hearing on 31 August. The court room was packed and there was
 room only. I counted at least 18 barristers and solicitors there. The
 Commonwealth has intervened and so has the state of New South Wales.
 This matter is attracting high levels of attention, even if the media
 are not paying any interest (yet).
 Importantly, the Court accepted an amendment to our summons that we
 obtain a:
 Declaration that sections 49ZS and 49ZT of the Anti-Discrimination
 (NSW) 1977 are invalid in that they impair the Plaintiff's right to
 freedom of political communication or impair his freedom of religion
 under Constitution section 116.
 I have been busy this week preparing submissions and other
 to support our case. Obviously, I will not discuss our arguments in
 detail here and will respectfully leave them for the consideration of
 the New South Wales Supreme Court of Appeal.
 The matter has been set down for hearing in November. Suffice to say
 that a victory against the Anti-Discrimination Act (NSW) 1977 will
 very serious ramifications for all other anti-discrimination laws,
 including S18C of the Racial Discrimination Act (Cth) 1975. In other
 words, the outcome of this case may well destroy anti-free speech
 before the politicians in parliament ever get around to repealing
 As such, when it comes to free speech, this battle is the number one
 game in town. And let's all hope that it is successful. Australians
 should not be forced to apologise for their conservative views on
 and morality. I, for one, won't.
 Thirdly, the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal held a
 Case Conference yesterday and decided to proceed with an additional 8
 complaints against me from Garry Burns, even though these matters are
 before the New South Wales Supreme Court of Appeal and even though
 Tribunal has already determined that there is no jurisdiction under
 South Wales anti-discrimination law to lodged complaints against
 in Queensland.
 Don't ask me to explain the logic here. I can't. But the matter has
 set for another Case Conference on 14 December 2016.
 As far as I am concerned, the Tribunal and the Anti-Discrimination
 below it are acting far beyond their powers. However, I will deal
 that issue after the main game, which is the action in the Court of
 Appeal.
 I was very grateful for the support I received at a fundraising
 held at the Coorparoo RSL on 27 August. Robyn Sully did a tremendous
 organising it and nearly 100 people attended.
 We are now in the early stages of planning to organise other such
 dinners across Australia. From the feedback received, attendees found
 a very good way of understanding these matters and their importance.
 From my perspective, it was an extremely effective way of getting
 particular story out and explaining to Australians how all of us are
 affected by totalitarian laws that seek to target conservative
 beliefs.
 If you are interested in attending the next dinner in Brisbane it
 be held at the Coorparoo RSL on 29 October at 6pm.

Zenaan it was difficult to read your reply. Not sure if I get your
We have a high court that determines where the slippery slope is and
seriously why should anyone be too worried that since 1975 we need to
take out the ability to stop hate speech in our courts?
Basically the proof is in the pudding as it were.
Australia is not America, we don't feel the need to enshrine and wine
about our rights.  We prefer to stop people from behaving as dicks.
Australia is not perfect and in some very obvious ways our social
policies are behindbut we are a country that is fine with robust
debate and aren't easily fooled into believing that hate speech needs
to be protected.

 > but there is a line and that is what 18c is about.
 Please, to make your post of the extract of 18c relevant, explain if
 are able why and how it is not a slippery slope (even assuming any or
 all aspects of that act are justifiable).
 And first, go check out, carefully, the definition of "slippery
slope" -
 Wikipedia is a reasonable first stop on some things like that.
 Next, in your response re the slippery slope, try if you can to
 consider the viewpoint of those who hold that there might be real
 problems with 18c which must be handled, and to give acknowledgement
 that position, so that your assessment can be seen as nuanced, rather
 than a black and white dichotomy.
 Nadine there are plenty folks much smarter than I who might
 to such a conversation, but most of us have had a gutful of "he's a
 dick, and you're all idiots for not seeing it" superficiality.
 Finally, an actual example of a public statement by Bernard Gaynor,
 which you say ought be held by the courts as illegal, and for the
 specific reasons you name and can identify. Feel free to use the
 you've already posted, but you might find it hard to ultimately
 that as "unlawful" speech, either way let's see if you have a nuanced
 argument.
 Sincerely,
 Zenaan

the bottom line is that assholes cant hide behind their vile and call
it free speech and find protection
im fine with finger pointing at the asshat and calling them out on
being what they are
i also believe in gun control and legal abortion. 
encypt your conversations and be a dick in private with other
dicksthis i think you have the right to.importantly that you have
right to privacy. the right to be free, to talk openly in private
without being monitored by others.
this is what I think freedom of speech is.

No I don't agree with you. Sorry but you dont get to define what free
speech is.
In 18c we arent talking about what is unpopular but what is public
vilification. There is a difference between debate and personal
attacks.Personal attacks whether physical or verbal are not acceptable
and are criminal in civilized society.
Free speech like guns can hurt when in the wrong hands, it is not

 Tribunal has already determined that there is no jurisdiction under
 South Wales anti-discrimination law to lodged complaints against
 in Queensland.
 Don't ask me to explain the logic here. I can't. But the matter has
 set for another Case Conference on 14 December 2016.
 As far as I am concerned, the Tribunal and the Anti-Discrimination
 below it are acting far beyond their powers. However, I will deal
 that issue after the main game, which is the action in the Court of
 Appeal.
 I was very grateful for the support I received at a fundraising
 held at the Coorparoo RSL on 27 August. Robyn Sully did a tremendous
 organising it and nearly 100 people attended.
 We are now in the early stages of planning to organise other such
 dinners across Australia. From the feedback received, attendees found
 a very good way of understanding these matters and their importance.
 From my perspective, it was an extremely effective way of getting
 particular story out and explaining to Australians how all of us are
 affected by totalitarian laws that seek to target conservative
 beliefs.
 If you are interested in attending the next dinner in Brisbane it
 be held at the Coorparoo RSL on 29 October at 6pm.
 Please email Robyn at robynsully at hotmail.com
 (mailto:robynsully at hotmail.com?subject=Fundraising%20Dinner) to book
 for further details.
 Thank you once again to all who have assisted financially, especially
 over the past month. We are slowly getting through all the thank you
 emails and I would like to thank the volunteers who have been able to
 provide support in this task.

 I am also looking for volunteers who can assist with video

 Finally, it was pleasing to see that over 65,000 people visited my
 webpage in August. Australians are looking for conservative views
 are not filtered out by the politically correct media. That is why
 radical left want the anti-discrimination laws that we are fighting.
 They want webpages like mine shut down and to deny Australians the
 opportunity to hear from anyone willing to stand up to their Safe
 Schools programs, their support of Islam and their attacks on our
 Western Christian traditions.
 Thank you once again for your support.

This is what we are engaging in and those who think differently than
me here will dismiss me with a simple - moron - tagbut this is exactly
what free speech is. We hold different opinions and voice them without
fear of personal attack.
Verbally attacking someone is not freedom its abuse. We are not free
to abuse others.

 View this email in your browser
  Dear Zenaan,
 Contents
 * Free Speech Update (
 * Fundraising Dinner (
 * Please help - donate $1 per week today (
 Since I last wrote to you on 22 August, there has been plenty of
 in the battle to speak the truth and speak it freely.
 First of all, I must thank all those who donated to assist in this
 battle. I incurred over $23,000 in fees last month. There is simply
 way that I could afford to wage this fight without your support. I am
 deeply grateful and humble for that assistance.
 Secondly, the New South Wales Supreme Court of Appeal held a
 Hearing on 31 August. The court room was packed and there was
 room only. I counted at least 18 barristers and solicitors there. The
 Commonwealth has intervened and so has the state of New South Wales.
 This matter is attracting high levels of attention, even if the media
 are not paying any interest (yet).
 Importantly, the Court accepted an amendment to our summons that we
 obtain a:
 Declaration that sections 49ZS and 49ZT of the Anti-Discrimination
 (NSW) 1977 are invalid in that they impair the Plaintiff's right to
 freedom of political communication or impair his freedom of religion
 under Constitution section 116.
 I have been busy this week preparing submissions and other
 to support our case. Obviously, I will not discuss our arguments in
 detail here and will respectfully leave them for the consideration of
 the New South Wales Supreme Court of Appeal.
 The matter has been set down for hearing in November. Suffice to say
 that a victory against the Anti-Discrimination Act (NSW) 1977 will
 very serious ramifications for all other anti-discrimination laws,
 including S18C of the Racial Discrimination Act (Cth) 1975. In other
 words, the outcome of this case may well destroy anti-free speech
 before the politicians in parliament ever get around to repealing
 As such, when it comes to free speech, this battle is the number one
 game in town. And let's all hope that it is successful. Australians
 should not be forced to apologise for their conservative views on
 and morality. I, for one, won't.
 Thirdly, the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal held a
 Case Conference yesterday and decided to proceed with an additional 8
 complaints against me from Garry Burns, even though these matters are
 before the New South Wales Supreme Court of Appeal and even though
 Tribunal has already determined that there is no jurisdiction under
 South Wales anti-discrimination law to lodged complaints against
 in Queensland.
 Don't ask me to explain the logic here. I can't. But the matter has

OFFENSIVE BEHAVIOUR BECAUSE OF RACE, COLOUR OR NATIONAL OR ETHNIC

likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or
intimidate another person [2] or a group of people; and
because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the
other person [3] or of some or all of the people in the group.
Section 46P of the _Australian Human Rights Commission Act
1986 _allows people to make complaints to the Australian Human Rights
Commission about unlawful acts. However, an unlawful act is not
necessarily a criminal offence. Section 26 says that this Act does
not make it an offence to do an act that is unlawful because of this
Part, unless Part IV expressly says that the act is an offence.
an act is taken not to be done in private if it:
images or writing to be communicated to the public; or
place; or
or hearing of people who are in a public place.

or not a charge is made for admission to the place.

Zenaan it was difficult to read your reply. Not sure if I get your
We have a high court that determines where the slippery slope is and
seriously why should anyone be too worried that since 1975 we need to
take out the ability to stop hate speech in our courts?
Basically the proof is in the pudding as it were.
Australia is not America, we don't feel the need to enshrine and wine
about our rights.  We prefer to stop people from behaving as dicks.
Australia is not perfect and in some very obvious ways our social
policies are behindbut we are a country that is fine with robust
debate and aren't easily fooled into believing that hate speech needs
to be protected.

 > but there is a line and that is what 18c is about.
 Please, to make your post of the extract of 18c relevant, explain if
 are able why and how it is not a slippery slope (even assuming any or
 all aspects of that act are justifiable).
 And first, go check out, carefully, the definition of "slippery
slope" -
 Wikipedia is a reasonable first stop on some things like that.
 Next, in your response re the slippery slope, try if you can to
 consider the viewpoint of those who hold that there might be real
 problems with 18c which must be handled, and to give acknowledgement
 that position, so that your assessment can be seen as nuanced, rather
 than a black and white dichotomy.
 Nadine there are plenty folks much smarter than I who might
 to such a conversation, but most of us have had a gutful of "he's a
 dick, and you're all idiots for not seeing it" superficiality.
 Finally, an actual example of a public statement by Bernard Gaynor,
 which you say ought be held by the courts as illegal, and for the
 specific reasons you name and can identify. Feel free to use the
 you've already posted, but you might find it hard to ultimately
 that as "unlawful" speech, either way let's see if you have a nuanced
 argument.
 Sincerely,
 Zenaan

the bottom line is that assholes cant hide behind their vile and call
it free speech and find protection
im fine with finger pointing at the asshat and calling them out on
being what they are
i also believe in gun control and legal abortion. 
encypt your conversations and be a dick in private with other
dicksthis i think you have the right to.importantly that you have
right to privacy. the right to be free, to talk openly in private
without being monitored by others.
this is what I think freedom of speech is.

  Dear Zenaan,
 Contents
 * Free Speech Update (
 * Fundraising Dinner (
 * Please help - donate $1 per week today (
 Since I last wrote to you on 22 August, there has been plenty of
 in the battle to speak the truth and speak it freely.
 First of all, I must thank all those who donated to assist in this
 battle. I incurred over $23,000 in fees last month. There is simply
 way that I could afford to wage this fight without your support. I am
 deeply grateful and humble for that assistance.
 Secondly, the New South Wales Supreme Court of Appeal held a
 Hearing on 31 August. The court room was packed and there was
 room only. I counted at least 18 barristers and solicitors there. The
 Commonwealth has intervened and so has the state of New South Wales.
 This matter is attracting high levels of attention, even if the media
 are not paying any interest (yet).
 Importantly, the Court accepted an amendment to our summons that we
 obtain a:
 Declaration that sections 49ZS and 49ZT of the Anti-Discrimination
 (NSW) 1977 are invalid in that they impair the Plaintiff's right to
 freedom of political communication or impair his freedom of religion
 under Constitution section 116.
 I have been busy this week preparing submissions and other
 to support our case. Obviously, I will not discuss our arguments in
 detail here and will respectfully leave them for the consideration of
 the New South Wales Supreme Court of Appeal.
 The matter has been set down for hearing in November. Suffice to say
 that a victory against the Anti-Discrimination Act (NSW) 1977 will
 very serious ramifications for all other anti-discrimination laws,
 including S18C of the Racial Discrimination Act (Cth) 1975. In other
 words, the outcome of this case may well destroy anti-free speech
 before the politicians in parliament ever get around to repealing
 As such, when it comes to free speech, this battle is the number one
 game in town. And let's all hope that it is successful. Australians
 should not be forced to apologise for their conservative views on
 and morality. I, for one, won't
 Thirdly, the New South Wales Civil and Administrative Tribunal held a
 Case Conference yesterday and decided to proceed with an additional 8
 complaints against me from Garry Burns, even though these matters are
 before the New South Wales Supreme Court of Appeal and even though
 Tribunal has already determined that there is no jurisdiction under
 South Wales anti-discrimination law to lodged complaints against
 in Queensland.
 Don't ask me to explain the logic here. I can't. But the matter has
 set for another Case Conference on 14 December 2016.
 As far as I am concerned, the Tribunal and the Anti-Discrimination
 below it are acting far beyond their powers. However, I will deal
 that issue after the main game, which is the action in the Court of
 Appeal.
 I was very grateful for the support I received at a fundraising
 held at the Coorparoo RSL on 27 August. Robyn Sully did a tremendous
 organising it and nearly 100 people attended.
 We are now in the early stages of planning to organise other such
 dinners across Australia. From the feedback received, attendees found
 a very good way of understanding these matters and their importance.
 From my perspective, it was an extremely effective way of getting
 particular story out and explaining to Australians how all of us are
 affected by totalitarian laws that seek to target conservative
 beliefs.
 If you are interested in attending the next dinner in Brisbane it
 be held at the Coorparoo RSL on 29 October at 6pm.
 Please email Robyn at robynsully at hotmail.com
 (mailto:robynsully at hotmail.com?subject=Fundraising%20Dinner) to book
 for further details.
 Thank you once again to all who have assisted financially, especially
 over the past month. We are slowly getting through all the thank you
 emails and I would like to thank the volunteers who have been able to
 provide support in this task.
 Please consider small regular donations if you would like to assist:

 I am also looking for volunteers who can assist with video
 or who live on the south side of Brisbane and who can assist with
 administrative support. If you would like to help, please email me.
 Finally, it was pleasing to see that over 65,000 people visited my
 webpage in August. Australians are looking for conservative views
 are not filtered out by the politically correct media. That is why
 radical left want the anti-discrimination laws that we are fighting.
 They want webpages like mine shut down and to deny Australians the
 opportunity to hear from anyone willing to stand up to their Safe
 Schools programs, their support of Islam and their attacks on our
 Western Christian traditions.
 Thank you once again for your support.
 Kind regards,
 Bernard Gaynor
 Christ is our king!

@_subject: Free speech - front lines in Australia - 
"True free speech demands that you allow horrible small minded idiots
the right to say vile things in public so that all unpopular but valid
opinions can be debated and society can grow." 
No I don't agree with you. Sorry but you dont get to define what free
speech is.
In 18c we arent talking about what is unpopular but what is public
vilification. There is a difference between debate and personal
attacks.Personal attacks whether physical or verbal are not acceptable
and are criminal in civilized society.
Free speech like guns can hurt when in the wrong hands, it is not
something that hatefull fwits can hide behind.
as of right or by invitation, whether express or implied and whether
or not a charge is made for admission to the place

So, free speech is ok so long as it is only used t o say yhe things
you find acceptable? :D
freedom of speech does not protect hate speechand that is what 18c
which Bernard supports being removed.
He is free to say
"I wouldn't let a gay person teach my children and I am not afraid to
say it," a Twitter post from Mr Gaynor read.
but there is a line and that is what 18c is about.
He is free to be a dick in private. Clearly with his being dismissed
he has trouble with what private is.
 >>Bernard Gaynor is a controversial Australian with conservative
 pro-family views whom some would say is ultra-conservative, to which
 would counter "that's just your post-modern moral relativism which
 dominates the current Western public and social dialogue".
 So, notwithstanding anyone's particular views on any particular issue
 which Bernard Gaynor stands for and champions (at least one of which
 strongly disagree with), his stand for freedom of speech is superb,
 courageous, persistent, and thyankfully a following has formed which
 donates to keep him and his family afloat in the face of the legal
 and the many personal sacrifices he has chosen to make, and some
 he has and continues to suffer at the hands of his opponents,
 the chief of the Australian Army who stepped down to an early
 in "moral disgrace" and knowing that he would not survive his very
 political attack against Bernard Gaynor's personal stands as an
 Australian Army reserve man (he sacked Bernard amongst other things).
 So plenty to debate, but the guts of this is free speech and the long
 standing statutory infractions against our right to freedom of
 and in particular as we name it for necessary but quirky reasons in
 Australia for legal and constitutional purposes:
 freedom to communicate on political and related matters
 Good luck Bernard,

This is what we are engaging in and those who think differently than
me here will dismiss me with a simple - moron - tagbut this is exactly
what free speech is. We hold different opinions and voice them without
fear of personal attack.
Verbally attacking someone is not freedom its abuse. We are not free
to abuse others.

 In a free and open society, even the invalid opinions have to be
allowed.  Fools should be allowed to make fools of themselves in
public.  And other fools should be allowed to ridicule them.
