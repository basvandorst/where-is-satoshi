Lol.  The InterPlanetary File System is a surveillance meme pushed on
image boards.
Let's take a look at what happens when you add files to IPFS:
- Each file and all of the blocks within it are given a unique
fingerprint called a cryptographic hash.""
- IPFS removes duplications across the network and tracks version
history for every file.""
- Each network node stores only content it is interested in, and some
indexing information that helps figure out who is storing what.""
- When looking up files, you're asking the network to find nodes storing
the content behind a unique hash.""
Their reasoning is even better:
Remember GeoCities? We don't.""
TL;DR: p2p + git = more accurate surveillance
