Hash: SHA512
Hi all,
Just an idea. In theory : is it possible to implement bitcoin wallet
into tor-relay and TBB 1) ? TBB users could tip tor-relays (f.e. 1
satoshi for guard and middle relay,  3 satoshi for exit-node per
circuit). Running tor-relays could be profitable or at least cheaper.
1).I think Cody Wilson is working on a bitcoin wallet in a browser.
