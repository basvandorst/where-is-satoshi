@_subject: HCPP20 Digital Totality 
We do not know if there will be a second wave of COVID-19. But we know
for sure the  will happen this year. Whether in a physical world
or a virtual one.
Alarming, topical, and disturbing, reflecting the rise of Digital Totality.
This is one of the last active cypherpunk/crypto-anarchist conferences
to be still held yearly. I was incredibly lucky to attend and
participate last year and I thought this would be one of the best places
to spread the word.

Hello all,
This is my first time posting, but I've been subscribed for months and I
even occasionally read some of the mails.
I've been reading the really old Usenet messages from people like Tim
May (RIP) and while I think a lot of it is inane BS, a lot of it is very
interesting especially in the pre-bitcoin speculation about what a
digital currency would be like.
I have two questions, why did the group die and what needs to happen to
bring it back? Afterall, you can still get usenet access for free if you
look for it and as long as you know how to create filters/killfiles, the
spam problem really isn't that bad.

Hi Karl,
Your message was blank, but I thought I would share a couple of
tutorials I wrote on this subject earlier this year. 
I chose Thunderbird, not because it is the best newsreader but because
it is one of the easiest to use and is the most cross-platform. I also
did a local Cypherpunk conference a couple of weeks ago and presented on
Usenet. If anyone is interested, I'll share the link to the video once
it goes up on YouTube.
