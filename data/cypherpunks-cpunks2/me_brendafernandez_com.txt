Crowdfunding + marketing smoke was the whole business plan. The only actual

Consider this: W10 is free and it's being pushed hard by MS. They even
force W7 and W8 users to download it when they aren't interested in
'upgrading'. So, if the product is free for you, who is the customer?

Windows TrueCrypt Fatally Flawed

Continued research after the first TrueCrypt audit yielded inconclusive
results has discovered fatal privilege escalation vulnerabilities allowing
for complete takeover
(archived ). So far this is known to affect
TrueCrypt on Windows boxes
but there is still potential for other flaws to be discovered in TrueCrypt
on other platforms. Details of the vulnerabilities are not yet disclosed,
but this supports the possibility that it may not be possible at all to
develop software offering any level of security on the Windows platform.
