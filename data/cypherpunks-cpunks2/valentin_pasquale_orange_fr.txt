@_subject: A new form of mailing list ? 
A friend showed my that : Which is someone trying to seek for people to talk with on the blockchain
Anyone here tried that ?
Is it a better form of mailing list for you cypher punks against censorship or whatever ?

The Ethereum blockchain support smart contract, therefore to interact with them you need to fill a "data form" in your transaction
Because you can fill in with the hexa you want (in any transaction), you can "write", and upload anything you want. The site etherscan.io can display the ASCII, for example here (it's written "Hi here") : Not my code but here is a JavaScript client using the etherscan API : Howerer because it's expensive (the more data you upload the expensive it is) I guess people would talk on one of the ethereum test net (on rinkeby you can get a dozen of ether for free, enough to talk for a while) (ethereum or another one it doesn't matter)
I guess next generation of Internet puzzle (like CICADA3301) will be upload on blockchains instead of twitter
I found the concept "cool" therefore seeking for your feedback being not a cypherpunk

It's not the "blockchain code" same way transactions (and the money you have) are not part of the code (the open source code can be modified not what you wrote), but this is the same thing yep except anyone can write (not just IE devs)
