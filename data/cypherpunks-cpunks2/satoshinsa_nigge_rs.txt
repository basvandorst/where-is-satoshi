HOW TO MAKE A MINT: THE CRYPTOGRAPHY OF ANONYMOUS ELECTRONIC CASH

1.WHAT IS ELECTRONIC CASH?
    1.1 Electronic Payment
    1.2 Security of Electronic Payments
    1.3 Electronic Cash
    1.4 Multiple Spending
2.A CRYPTOGRAPHIC DESCRIPTION
    2.1 Public-Key Cryptographic Tools
    2.2 A Simplified Electronic Cash Protocol
    2.3 Untraceable Electronic Payments
    2.4 A Basic Electronic Cash Protocol
3.PROPOSED OFF-LINE IMPLEMENTATIONS
    3.1 Including Identifying Information
    3.2 Authentication and Signature Techniques
    3.3 Summary of Proposed Implementations
4.OPTIONAL FEATURES OF OFF-LINE CASH
    4.1 Transferability
    4.2 Divisibility
5.SECURITY ISSUES
    5.1 Multiple Spending Prevention
    5.2 Wallet Observers
    5.3 Security Failures
    5.4 Restoring Traceability
Electronic payment systems come in many forms including digital checks,
debit cards, credit cards, and stored value cards. The usual security
features for such systems are privacy (protection from eavesdropping),
authenticity (provides user identification and message integrity), and
nonrepudiation (prevention of later denying having performed a
transaction) .
The type of electronic payment system focused on in this paper is
electronic cash. As the name implies, electronic cash is an attempt to
construct an electronic payment system modelled after our paper cash
system. Paper cash has such features as being: portable (easily
carried), recognizable (as legal tender) hence readily acceptable,
transferable (without involvement of the financial network), untraceable
(no record of where money is spent), anonymous (no record of who spent
the money) and has the ability to make "change." The designers of
electronic cash focused on preserving the features of untraceability and
anonymity. Thus, electronic cash is defined to be an electronic payment
system that provides, in addition to the above security features, the
properties of user anonymity and payment untraceability..
