@_subject: [cryptography] three crypto lists - why and which 
Crypto List It's probably not worth mentioning the sci.crypt newsgroup, is it? There is *occasionally* some intelligent discussion there.

@_subject: [cryptography] The Unbreakable Cipher 
If the message is chosen from a uniform distribution over n bits (and assuming that the message is not used for something else after it is deciphered), the adversary will not be able to distinguish a correctly deciphered message from an incorrectly deciphered message, no matter how short the key is in comparison to the data.
Now, you could easily argue that there is absolutely no reason to send a message with those properties, but that isn't really the point.

@_subject: Fwd: Chaos theory 
Sorry that this question is only tangentially related to cryptography.
Then again, a lot of the stuff here is only tangentially related.
Could anybody here link me to some good resources on chaos theory? I'm
not looking for anything specifically about certain chaotic systems
(like the Lorentz Attractor or Chua's circuit), but instead about
general methods to identify and evaluate chaotic systems. Maybe
something related to calculating fractional dimensions, &c.
This would be a great help.
