Radioactivity is almost uniquely insensitive to tampering through environmental
influences, though, owing to the large energy scale of nuclear processes [1].
Unfortunately, it does not automatically follow that the circuit used to
detect it is also similarly robust, and NSA would probably be able to
easily develop the capability to eavesdrop on Geiger-counter based RNGs
if they become widespread.  A high DC voltage, and abrupt current pulses -
this is sounding rather similar to a spark-gap transmitter.
[1] A handful of exceptions exist involving low-energy beta decays, such as
Dy-163 and Re-187.

Geez, sounds like things have taken a turn for the worse at LL since I worked
there. :/
I think there's a significant probability LL has been subject to some sort
of TLA interference of that type, although I can't comment on this matter
in particular.
In about Nov. 2011, while I worked there, there was a very odd incident
in which word came down from on high that management wanted OTR banned from
private user-to-user chat.  The official viewer didn't support it, but some
third-party viewers did, and the stated justification was to avoid
"fragmenting the user experience" and "creating an exclusionary environment"
 - as if private chat weren't exclusionary by its very nature!
At this point, I will note that, as of the last time I had source access
to it, the SL server logged the full text of all chat even in its production
All this seemed really not-very-okay to me and suspicious in light of the
flimsy justifications given and the lack of apparent association with any
of the product-type people one would expect such concerns to originate from.
It all seemed to be Rod Humble and the corporate counsel.
This came up in one of the server-side engineering staff meetings, and
seemed to incite a good deal of opposition - which eventuated in Rod showing
up himself to argue the point.  He actually backed down, or at least gave
the appearance of doing so - I'm not sure whether to count myself proud or
embarrassed at having lost my temper a bit and accused him of being a fascist.
I didn't hear anything more about it during the time I worked there, but I
didn't stay that long after, having gotten a distinct sense that these were
not the sort of people I wanted to be working for.
I don't definitively know what degree of outside pressure was involved,
although at one point Rod Humble seemed to let slip implied confirmation of
my suspicion with the phrasing "why would I want to stand up to the FBI?" or
phrasing to that effect.  I think it's clear that the current management
of LL are very decidedly *not* on the side of freedom, although I think the
*engineers* there mostly are.
