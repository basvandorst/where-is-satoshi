"Reset Safari" doesn't really clean all the cookies of Safari web browser
"Caches - This folder has the potential to be a gold mine of historical
data for the examiner.  The contents include information of application
usage, web sites visited, buddy lists, downloaded files, etc.  The best
general advice that can be given regarding this directory is explore.  Look
in the folders here and see how the information may apply to your specific
case.  Keep in mind that many folders here will remain even after an
application has been removed from the system"

Apple Safari web browser version 5 and higher started to have a new "privacy
option" in a main menu, "Reset Safari".  It's supposed to clean all the
private data saved by the browser.  Instead of that it's giving the user a
false sense of privacy, because many other files survive on the computer's
hard drive.
Let's see, how precise is Safari when cleaning cookies Reset Safari... --> Remove all cookies. But something resides in ~/Library/Safari/LocalStorage still:
cd ~/Library/Safari/LocalStorage
ls [and hunderds of others]
whats inside? sqlite3 http_ .dump
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
CREATE TABLE ItemTable (key TEXT UNIQUE ON CONFLICT REPLACE, value TEXT NOT
NULL ON CONFLICT FAIL);

Another place where unknown content resides is Adobe Flash's LSO cookie
cache, located at: ~/Library/Caches/Adobe/Flash Player/
The most interesting is this file:
~/Library/Caches/Metadata/Safari/History/.tracked\ filenames.plist
Suspicious is especially the fact, the file is hidden (starting with a dot)
and saved in 'History folder', bypassing probably "Clean Cookies.."
Some users have met this under unknown conditions. The puropose of this file is still not well known. If you get it, analyze!

It's like cleaning the hands. You wash them after touching something rotten. And you clean them before touching something clean. Comments requested

My script delete simply everything. Advancing welcomed. Much more interesting seems to be the file:
~/Library/Caches/Metadata/Safari/History/.tracked\ filenames.plist
No satisfactory description found and seems to resists "History clean" as
well... Unable to simulate the conditions to get the file again. Did anyone?
