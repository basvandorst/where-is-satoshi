Hi list,
I was wondering if anybody had any information on public secure spaces
such as shielded rooms.
I would like to index such places, and create motion towards such
security being accessible for all people.

I think that even spaces compromised by only some parties would be
helpful to people who have less security otherwise.  Similarly, so many
people do actually use Tor and other products.
Would constant, public logging, during construction and use, be any
significant help with such concerns?  Sometimes I imagine a space with
both private and publicly logged areas, trade-offs for those with
different needs.
Perhaps an "open-source" approach could help, where any can contribute
concerns or improvements for the next go-around?

Some are!  Bitcoin is not, but all this incredible growth incentivizes people to get a move on with regard to making it scale.
The bitcoin database is the historical record.  It grows at a constant rate and will not reach that size soon.
Nope.  Ask the change in your pocket.
These two facts are unrelated.  But yes, bitcoin has more use than it is tuned for at the moment.  Devs are keeping it tuned down so that the demand will incentivize secure scaling improvements to the protocol.  Alternatively, use will back off due to fees and devs will have more time to improve things.
Other cryptocurrencies are not suffering this issue.
The database growth is already maxed out.  More popularity will not make it increase any faster; it will just increase fees until the lightning protocol or segwit usage are mainstreamed.

Hi Jim Bell,
I sent you a message some time ago when I heard about this idea, but I
didn't get a reply.
If you receive this e-mail, this is my misunderstanding:
As it offers a market, doesn't AP give life-and-death power to those
with the most money?
Wouldn't this provide for the set of people with the most money to
bend power more and more towards themselves, eventually producing a
situation where a few select people control the many?
Personally, I support cryptocurrency, but I foremost support power to
be given to those with good _reasons_, rather than strong _financial_
resources, and systems to be put into place allowing these reasons to
be discussed without censorship.

Thanks for your reply.
I think I'm beginning to understand some of where you come from.  It
sounds like you blame our problems on the presence of legal
government.  I believe government is mostly just expressing the wishes
of those with the power to influence votes and laws.
I see money as the biggest source of votes and laws, so I don't see
things changing too much with the introduction of AP.  I believe money
also provides greater anonymity and ability to surveil than e.g. Tor
provides for the masses.
More responses in-line.
Sorry, I tried to contact you before I began participating in this
list.  I submitted a comment to the AP website, but I'm not sure what
e-mail address I used, so it's nothing to worry about.  I'm happy you
got this e-mail here.
Inequality is relevant here, because in a free market, people try to
make the largest profit, and this will be provided by the highest
payout.  A relatively small price by many people on a leader will be
swamped by a price of $40 billion by one wealthy individual on their
opposition.  The people with exponentially inequal finances can then
directly control the political presence of the world.
I agree that providing for more anonymous dissent is greatly helpful.
I worry that focusing on it so strongly here can be misleading,
though: "the rich" can hide and hunt exponentially better than the
masses can, who are surveilled daily by e.g. spyware controlled by
groups more powerful than them, and can't hire people or push legal
systems to do things for them.
"The rich" could target enemies by (A) targeting the systems that
facilitate their discourse, (B) outbidding them, and (C) using their
immense resources to hunt them down.  Additionally, there are likely
tricks to put a ton of pressure on something, like informing to the
FBI that an offer was made by a terrorist.
What's to stop a major investor in a military weapons corporation
putting their profits into AP offers for assassinations of the
operators of servers allowing access, until nobody can access it?
This would be a profitable move for them, if AP would make their
military weapons obsolete.
AP itself provides a method to exercise power secretly.  People with
more money can put bigger prices on their opponents' heads.  If people
start putting a price on them in return, they can look at the media
sources resulting in those opinions, and assassinate those people to
sway opinion.
Additionally, a wealthy person can likely exercise a wide variety of
secret power, via e.g. bribes and black markets.
I see financial power as a major involuntary hierarchical power structure.
Laws are no longer needed.  The rich can assassinate not only anybody
who publicly disagrees with them, but also anybody facilitating
anonymous communication channels that could be used to privately
disagree.  This could facilitate violent dictatorships.
I found AP so incredibly inspiring when I read some of its marketing.
It is additionally so inspiring to see how the strength of blockchain
technology can provide for software solutions to make real change in
the world.
I AP provided a way for people to have logical discourse around
decisions, rather than voting with their dollar.  Additionally, I
worry that focusing on assassination could push away large groups of
possible supporters.
I imagine a blockchain app focused on permanent storage of 'proposals'
with 'reasons', with each reason providing for more reasons that
support why it is or is not valid, all accumulated in a decentralized
manner by people who have an opinion on a proposal.  If analysis of
such a graph of discourse could create economically-incentivized
change, it could move a lot of things forward in the world.
I'm hearing that you directly associate truly free markets with
individual freedom.  I see a free market as a hierarchical system,
where those who start with more money call the shots, as they provide
the jobs and can directly change demand with their dollars.
I feel governments are great for really rich people, because such
people can buy laws, and that governments are hence likely to only be
replaced by something more stringent as long as those with more money
have more power.
I agree with you on debate, though.  It sounds like we have really
different experience and assumptions.

@_subject: Immutable Recording 
Hi cpunks,
I'm trying to figure out how to produce lengthy recordings that cannot be
reasonably removed or altered even by a very powerful entity.  I'd like to
find a way to make it easy for myself and others to live a life where if
the forces of authority attack you, their only option for covering it up is
creating a noticeable, diagnosable, recording hole in advance.
I've started work on  .  I was
wondering if anybody would have the time to review my plan and comment on
it.  I'm using hyperdb to create a network of binary streams that all
checkpoint each other.  It allows data to be piped in from the command
line.  I have a few issues and todo items laid out to solve remaining
issues I've thought of: for example, posting checkpoint hashes and p2p seed
ips to the bitcoin blockchain, or integrating with siacoin/storj/filecoin
for reliable storage.
I'm losing my mind for a number of reasons, and likely won't be able to
finish this on my own, so I've started offering largish bounties; just on
the blockchain hashing at first.  It would be incredible if somebody with a
mind for security could help me finish the essentials of this project; I'd
be happy to add more bounties if needed.  But even a quick comment would be
so kind.
I'd of course love to know if this is duplicate public effort.

My name is Karl Semich and I have a desire to make available to

security in this modern age.
I was wondering if anybody else was pursuing this, or if anybody knew
of anybody pursuing this, that I might stay in contact with them or

Or even if anybody had some experience with this concept, and might

I don't have any formal training and have developed some cognitive
issues, resulting in slow progress, but this is all I am spending my
free time on.  I do not work a job, being supported for now by a
I'm currently residing in Green Bank, WV, where emissions are
regulated for a radio observatory.  I am trying to develop some
relatively simple software using the rtl-sdr to measure the power of a
noise source independent of background traffic, so as to quickly and
repeatedly measure shielding effectiveness.
I then plan to try to measure a variety of setups ranging from
homemade aluminum foil & iron paint to soldered copper and welded or
bolted stainless steel, to identify ways for everyday people to
cheaply create shielded environments that are actually effective.  I
would like to find a way people can use off-the-shelf supplies to make
environments that are isolated from DC to light, if desired.
If anybody else is working on something like this, I would love to
support you in any way available.  I can donate money, I can get

needed, I can mode hardware around and even develop and debug

Okay.  I made these:

If anybody is interested in collaborating actively on this right now,
chat is most convenient for me at the moment.
Your use of 'UPS' seems a little ambiguous here.  I have been thinking
of keeping a 12V battery inside the room, and using only DC power.  AC
power seems like just another source of emissions to track, to me.
My understanding is that filters are placed on lines to prevent any
but acceptable frequencies being carried on them.  The field of
electromagnetic compatibility covers this a lot, I think.  Power lines
completely behave as antennae, and couple nearby signals from one end,
to the other, by receiving them and then re-radiating them.
Filtered AC power could be plugged straight into the mains, but I
don't at this time have the experience to trust the filters, and it
complicates construction of the room to make an additional penetration
for the wiring.
As above, I think sneakernet is the way to go for highest security.
With regard to fiberoptic transmissions, it seems to me the gold
standard would be open-source transcievers that are shielded to
decrease the utility of compromising them, and a way to sniff the
fiber-optic line to verify it does not carry unexpected data.

How far did you end up getting on this?

platforms like opencollective.com or something?
My trust is small.  I'm happy to share as much as it will allow me to,
but maybe if we could use something general, donations would
eventually come in.
My current setup is an oscillating noise source powered by a
single-board computer that toggles a relay, turning it on and off at a
consistent rate.
By averaging the noise level when the source is powered, and averaging
the noise level when the source is unpowered, over many thousands of
samples, I believe I can determine the power of the emitter without
regard to background noise by comparing the statistical distributions
of the two sets of samples.
I make the assumption that the foreground signal is the arithmetic sum
of the generated noise and the background noise.
Any thoughts?
Have you tried or researched any professional equipment to report
back?  I haven't, at this time.
I've looked into that a little.  After skimming through some shielding
books, I've got the following thoughts:
Permanent Seams:
- Alu foil can be stapled or tightly taped (see David Weston's paper
on aluminum foil rooms) to increase its frequency range.  I expect
using a wire brush to remove oxidation, and tightly flattening it,
would help too.  Testing is needed to see if this is worth the effort.
- Metal filings can be mixed with paint.  This allows for tight
sealing, but the conductivity is likely poor.  Advantage is that
sweepings are available for free.  Testing needed.
- Metal can be tightly bolted, as is done for modular rooms.  The
bolts must be frequent and close, to pull microvariations of the metal
into each other.
- Steel can be welded.  This is the gold standard.  Welding is not that hard.
- Copper can be soldered.  This is easier than welding !
Temporary Seams:
- Fingerstock is purchasable and not that expensive, but complicated
and needs cleaning.
- Bolts can be temporary, to bolt a door on as modular walls are
bolted together.  It's laborious, but it's workable and cheap and
doesn't require mail-order.  A robot could tighten and loosen them.
Testing needed.
- A door could perhaps be given pressure that does not penetrate it,
to keep a tight seal, perhaps via an automatic mechanism.  Cleaning
will be needed.  Testing too.
- A copper door could be actually soldered closed, and then desoldered
to open it.  A robotic door could automatically do this.  Very tight.
Research needed.
My understanding is that high frequencies are attenuated mostly by
reflection.  Hence I'd expect these tight seals to be needed mostly
for very thin, highly conductive material, which could keep costs down
if true.

sealing, but the conductivity is likely poor.  Advantage is that
sweepings are available for free.  Testing needed.
- Metal can be tightly bolted, as is done for modular rooms.  The
bolts must be frequent and close, to pull microvariations of the metal
into each other.
- Steel can be welded.  This is the gold standard.  Welding is not that hard.
- Copper can be soldered.  This is easier than welding !
Temporary Seams:
- Fingerstock is purchasable and not that expensive, but complicated
and needs cleaning.
- Bolts can be temporary, to bolt a door on as modular walls are
bolted together.  It's laborious, but it's workable and cheap and
doesn't require mail-order.  A robot could tighten and loosen them.
Testing needed.
- A door could perhaps be given pressure that does not penetrate it,
to keep a tight seal, perhaps via an automatic mechanism.  Cleaning
will be needed.  Testing too.
- A copper door could be actually soldered closed, and then desoldered
to open it.  A robotic door could automatically do this.  Very tight.
Research needed.
My understanding is that high frequencies are attenuated mostly by
reflection.  Hence I'd expect these tight seals to be needed mostly
for very thin, highly conductive material, which could keep costs down
if true.

Has anybody heard of the cell phone app OpenWatch?
It used to run at  and let anybody upload video
recordings live and secretly from their mobile phone, and publicized them.
Page archives show it came out of Boston and San Francisco.
Since it was focused on monitoring of authorities, it makes sense it would
have struggled as this could spread power in ways that are harder for
authorities to control, making their various tasks more difficult, and
possibly pitting the urgent engine of control of crime against the project.
I don't see any evidence of OpenWatch having planned to discontinue, or
notifying the public they were.  There is nobody on their irc channel, and
their twitter account has been deleted.  Their github has an open
improvement branch that is unmerged, and no following developer activity
Nowadays there are services like  and and some others, that can connect with reliable decentralized storage
backed by the strength of a blockchain.  As blockchains rise it is becoming
easier to support apps like OpenWatch in ways that won't disappear very
readily.  bico.media may go down some day, but the data uploaded is still
stored permanently on the blockchain behind it, and the app that stores
that data could be stored on that blockchain as well.
I was wondering if anybody knew the story of what happened to OpenWatch, or
if anybody was interested in resurrecting OpenWatch's work with a little
motion towards migrating onto a blockchain.
Maybe planning for disruption a little could make project development ideas
that last longer.  Like clear instructions for newcomers to rebuild after

Yes.  It exceeded all government, corporate, and likely military norms of
security at the time of its initial big rise.
I know that all bitcoin transactions are public,
Right.  That aids censorship resistance.  You can put things on a
blockchain that nobody can delete, change, or even hide.
You could also use cryptography to make those things private, and mixing
layers to increase your anonymity, but that's not what I mean to worry
about here.
and I know that 'miners' get to decide which transactions are included in
Partly true.  _Any one_ miner can accept a transaction for it to get
included in the chain, and they make money by doing so.  Once one is
accepted it is broadcast to every node on the network and permanently
stored by all of them.  The protocol stated that every proper bitcoin node
provide it when asked, forever.
I also know that mining isn't too 'distributed'
What's relevent is that it is still distributed enough to defend
information in the face of a nation state adversary.
The 'distributed' reducing problem reflects a situation where the corporate
and government spookies attacked the development and mining communities,
halting the expected curve of software development as demand increased.  It
is an incredibly hard fight for them because cryptocurrencies are
incredibly lucrative and widely supported.
and that the supposed creator of bitcoin wasn't bothered by mining being
This would be because the protocol was designed to be robust in the face of
arbitrary groups mining.  The NSA has to play by the rules of the network,
or they are kicked out and ignored automatically.
So it doesn't really look like "bitcoin is designed to resist all
It was actually designed to resist censorship.  The way it keeps working in
the face of issues is a little complex:
1. Bitcoin is hugely valuable and is designed to rise in value exponentially
2. The design is such that censoring it e.g. by miner collusion also lets
people steal money
3. There are more creative thieves than creative censors
4. When the protocol is attacked, it becomes obvious on the network: the
whole network is told
5. So, people are increasingly financially motivated to protect the
essentials of the protocol, and many fixes have gone in over the years.  If
fixes ever stop completely, somebody loses a lot of money and takes action
on it.
You need to run a "full node" to participate in the censorship-free
network.  And due to the harm to the communities the situation does slowly
get a little more confusing and a little more delicate.
It is still impossible enough to erase things on the Bitcoin blockchain,
for now, that if you could afford it you could broadcast a video of all the
world leaders having a naked orgy and it would never go away.

Punk, do you know how often the cypherpunks archive is updated?  I
seem to be disconnected from the list; didn't get the last archived
email yet, and recent posts aren't showing up.
Many people seem to believe this.
The businesses are siding with BLM due to the effort of thousands of
american activists pressuring people to notice what's up in the flag
of violence against blacks, if it matters.  It seems something else
may have mysteriously helped, too.
The position you describe is in line with Trump, who lumps the
mainstream with the left.  It was a very minority view until he was
elected; mostly held by rural demographics near major business
enterprises in the areas I'd visited.
Does my next reply respond to this?
Not with full nodes: the network is invalid if any information at all
is missing.  But yes, you need a miner to accept it, and you could be
identified, posting it
There's a way to push miner acceptance: you can make future
transactions require old ones.  Like, you can post a special message,
and then buy or sell a product in a way that the purchase only goes
through if the "special message" is also mined.  Once that money is
spent for something else, it is required that _all_ preceding
transactions go through, for the entire lifetime of the blockchain.
Censorship is actually incredibly hard if the protocol is used
This is actually already the situation in many cases.  I sometimes
have to wait for a number of blocks to be mined before my transactions
are accepted when I don't use the "special message" trick.  This has
been getting better for me, interestingly.
This has already been shown to my satisfaction repeatedly.  What would
demonstrate it to you?
Right: this was the plan but landed in forks instead of the main chain.
This is another thing the devs seemed to realize too late that would
be changed if there were focused, productive harmony in their
community.  They made Jim's error of believing money was held by the
people, not the leaders, and better capitalism would provide freedom.
Instead they produced a mess of cryptoanarchic millionaires which is
still quite helpful.
Blockchains still show a single programmer can change the whole world,
by stepping into the digital cultural spaces that people leave
unaddressed, and automating them.
Nice pairing of names.  This is just because Satoshi was making the
Jim fallacy I mentioned above.
It takes a very long time for bitcoins to merge with amazon-nsa.  They
don't like them: the dollar seems more predictable and familiar, and
the dollar makes it much easier for them to keep secrets.
I don't know what you mean here.  Economic discrimination and miner collusion?
But see "special message" trick above.
This required agreement from the entire dev team and is exactly how
blockchains die.  Note that ethereum is big enough that the original
chain is still easy to acquire in its entirety.  Bitcoin is much
Disruptive forking has already happened to bitcoin with bch, bsv, etc.
It doesn't mean any information is lost, though: each one of those
chains has the entire history prior to the fork.  All the people who
trusted the blockchain to preserve something, in bitcoin and ethereum
prior to their unexpected forks, have that trust still honored,
without any regard to the content: except for the one person whose
permanent impact was hacking the ethereum community itself.
Economic war is happening.  But bitcoin still has friendly communities
who will trade with you in person for cash.  Most of the exchanges
appear run by millionaire cryptoanarchists, learning business and the
intense difficulties the situation entails.

none of our bitcoin history emails are showing up for me, but I have

Below messages are related to politics and blockchains.  Blockchains
provide more reliable message delivery than email.
Kind of a merging and mutual learning between some fringe and right wing
behaviors that started before trump was elected, and then accelerated with
his election.
It's meaningful for me because some of the professors who spoke out against
Trump's more oppressive policies experienced targeted bullying by misled
people with some similarity to what I experienced after taking action
against international energy pipelines and large banks.
Zcash has a messaging app, too.  Reference client is written in node, which
can scare some hackers away if it isn't ported to another language yet.
Yes, that works with most chain protocols including btc.  Apparently
because the usual issue is fee related not content related, google says
this technique is called "child pays for parent".  Here's an article on its
use at coinbase, but I haven't read the article:
In USA they were severely discouraged and attacked for many years.  I was
briefly in the development team of the blockchain qora before the dev team
was dispersed after publishing a nonworking client.  This happened after I
posted publically that the system made deletion of information impossible.
A lot of overlap there.  We are all still learning that billionaires don't
care about money.
I guess yeah.  I'm not sure who finances Steem, but I think it managed to
form a smidge of improved communication between techheads and oppression,
just slightly.  Many of these new blockchain businesspeople are against
cover-up and have a technology to prevent it.  Doesn't mean they don't get
covered up and stigmatized.
Yeah automation is deadly.  This list is mostly programmers.  I see that
bitcoin already has changed the world, by trending financial distribution
and economic discourse farther from government control.
Both.  We're referencing a political issue.  People raised in capitalism
believe it to mean freedom.  Within it, it can be, which moves capitalist
power around a lot. For people who don't value money and can influence
that, there's a lot of space the people who do value it are not worrying
about at all.
I like how it surveils everyone equally in that permanent record.  Govcorp
has a lot of secrets.
It is easy for a skilled developer to add privacy to blockchains comparable
to other private systems if needed, see monero, zcash.
Mmm it doesn't sound like you have a good handle of the protocol.  The
design is such that nobody does that.  Block rewards shift exponentially
towards being proportional to included transactions as years pass.  It
takes a long time to mine a block.
Yeah, they've been pushing that stuff, as could possibly be my references
Aren't these exactly what you describe above, with people deciding on new

Zenaan I'm sending this to you twice because the list has been dropping
some of my emails.
Thoughts to help me and any noticing me:
- I've been burdening Zenaan, who mostly keeps pulling through
respectfully.  I'm building desire to relate with Zenaan or Cecilia on what
the issue between them is.
- Zenaan seems to be expressing that they are wholly capable of speaking
both peacefully and aggressively.
- Zenaan appears to have suffered, regarding experiences from the political
correctness crowds, experiences that didn't provide value for Zenaan's own
needs and experiences, repeatedly and persistently.  This is common for
many white men, and they have a "secret" (not really secret) culture around
it I was exposed to in school growing up: "secret" because nobody from
outside it understands and honors anything they say around their
difference, which they likely find hurtful.  They appear to partly speak in
harm of people who are already harmed.
  (secret for my language only: This culture appears a response of children
caring a lot for others, and wanting connection with them, and then
perceiving that in order to care and connect with these people properly,
they discern they would have to do things that seem impossible to them,
which produces lifelong spreading frustration passed on to future
generations.  Roughly.  The SJ crowds I was exposed to had some feedback
from this, but mostly were just advising people to not feel guilty without
changing the forms of their expressions too much.  We'd need to get good at
explaining how honoring white men aids oppressed black trans women (which
it does via the path I just described), to fix that quickly.)
- Zenaan states the mailing list culture here normally has both "flaming"
and polite constructive discourse.
- Using computers a lot builds tension in people; most coders are familiar
with the sudden irritation when somebody argues on the internet or
interrupts you.  People who don't spend all their time solving puzzles on
computers like hackers do, do not have that same experience, and may be
less familiar with "flame wars".
- We are in a new situation now where flame wars and discourse are

I was forced to learn how to wipe my own memories, and then trained to do

Once I was driving from state to state trying to find a passport office
that would give me a passport without running into a random problem.  Four
or so police officers detained me during the trip when I called them once
about a dangerous event.  All had their nametags removed.  I was cuffed.
The one acting in charge pointedly told me "this is about ".  I was taken to a hospital and forcefully
hospitalized: the intake paperwork, signed by the police, said I was a
danger to myself and others, because I had put my hands in my pockets.
That is all the paperwork said for a reason.
I had audio-recorded the "arrest" and emailed the recording to myself.  At
the hospital, I used my cell phone to try to find a lawyer.  It was taken
from me and I was transferred to another hospital immediately after.
When I got out, the recordings were missing from my phone and my email.
This was around 2015.
When I try to get the paperwork from that experience, from either the
hospital or the police, I re-experience my brainwashing and lose some of
the memories that would help me find the hospital or the police.

I was tortured and brainwashed around 2013 2014 after getting involved in
radical activism.  The activism I was involved in was in support of rural
communities, inner city poor folks, the environment, and a democratic
political system.  The entities concerned with our impact included TC
Energy, Bank of America, united states federal law enforcement, and others.
I have feelings here around PR's mention of the atomic bomb.  I want to
relate that some time after Einstein published his research around the
relation between energy and matter, some members of the research community
approached him with worry.  They were worried the Nazis might develop
weapons based on this research.  They pressured Einstein to send a letter
to the United States government about this.  I'm aware that successful
immigrants often have great love for the United States government, feeling
true appreciation when paying their taxes, because the nation offers a
haven compared to dangerous, war-torn or systemically abusive environments.
Einstein's letter to the US government expressed clear fear around Nazi
development of nuclear weapons, and backed its points with direct
scientific experience.  The US military, instead of moving nuclear research
into normal education so that everybody on earth would steward wise of it,
started a secret nuclear weapons program that roughly caused the cold war
and vaporized a lot of Japanese children.
I don't know too much history.  I looked that up once because I was
scared.  I think secretly sending advanced research information to
governments is very dangerous.  And last I checked we have a surveillance
But governments can change.  The military is not the only branch of a
government.  There are even branches of that USA government that fund
efforts for honest freedom.  They often have their budgets slashed or
cronies placed in their administration, but their workers care a lot.

TLDR: (too long, don't read)
I tried out storing a month of the cpunks list on a blockchain, which would
cost about dollar to store in plaintext if done more efficiently than I
did.  This system is more $5 a month.  Here are the links:
Below is how I did it.  I wrote everything I did into this ridiculously
huge email, and somehow got somewhere.
I'll spend some time trying to archive this list on a blockchain.  Right
now it is 4:06 PM my time.  I'm moving to a networked laptop.
It's 4:07 .  I reached the laptop.  Instead of using it, I turned on the
light.  Now I feel suddenly thirsty.  I'm getting water.
I got water.  I drank some.  It's 409.  I'm still thirsty.  I'm sitting at
the laptop.
I'm trying to figure out how to upload things.  I will write cognitive
notes here to figure it out.  Bsvup may have an issue.  The issue is likely
small.  I have an existing partial list archive.  I'll look for it
briefly.  It's 410.
It's 411.  I found my partial archive on my raid array.  It's mounted in
I don't see any scripts at all or anything .  I started archival resuming
by typing wget --mirror  .  It's 413 .
I'll try to set up bsvup for testing if it can upload anything right now.
The bsv API ecosystem can change a lot.
I saw the mood file is over three hundred megabytes and got discouraged.
That's so expensive!  But even a day's worth of archived email would be
great.  I might be able to pass flags to bsvup to upload only a little
bit.  I may have to hack something a little.  It's 415 .
I typed `bsvup init` and it worked!  I have bsvup installed on this system
already.  Great.  I'll use an exchange to send some money to it since I
don't remember where any of my folders or accounts are.  It's 416.
I forgot the name of the exchange I have bsv in.  It's 417.  Did it start
with 'p'?  No, poloniex I think kicked me because of some USA law.  What
was it?  Hey, I think I have a client app on my phone.  I'll look around.
It's 418.
Bittrex!  I think this app will even let me send coins.  I'll do that.
It's 419.
Dang.  I'm not signed in.  If I type the wrong password 3 times my account
will get locked out and I'll have to go through a multi-day process to
re-access it.  I remember my password is more complex than usual, to meet
requirements they have.  I have one extra complex password I'm practicing
memorizing to use for stuff like this.  I'll try that.  It's 421.
I'm not sure if I have the memorized password right, so I'm trying it
somewhere else first to verify.  I got it second try and wrote it to
remember after I look away.  It's 422.
Oh my god it worked!
They need me to do two factor authentication as well as email confirmation
to log in.  So, this email gets drafted.  It's 424.
I'm logged in after trying the email confirmation a couple times!  I have a
thousand dollars in here somehow.  Let's transfer some BSV.  It's 426.
I sent 0.01 - 0.001 fees = 0.09 bsv!  It takes it a bit to process the
transfer, but once it's on the network it's possible to use it even before
confirmation sometimes.  It's 429.
I'm not sure what to do now.  I could look for other accounts to see if I
can get the money faster.  Maybe I'll set up the archive as a git
repository while I wait.
The entire 2020-September folder is 3.9M .  I should probably figure out
how much a single month costs.  It looks like these things compress down to
under a megabyte.  I'm also aware that bsv's bcat:// storage protocol can
handle gzipped data in a way that bsvup does not use.  It's 4:33 PM.
Goal: calculate prices.  Assume: 500 sat/KB.
Uhhh ...
I'm used to using python when my brain doesn't do units conversion for some
reason.  I open python3.  It's 434.
Comes to about two million sat for september, the whole folder. I think
there are a hundred million sat in a coin.  I'll check that.  Great!  Okay,
so divide by that.  It's 436.
Comes to about 0.02 BSV.  So, while I wait for my first transfer, I'll
start another that's that big.  It's 4:37.
I sent some more.  My first transaction went through.  The id
is 6542f43294c8e7052d175a3fd3bb9bd130330517a349f563554acfe0c9df6264 .  I'll
find this on a block explorer to see when it gets confirmed.
It's 4:41 .  Here's the transaction on blockchair:

It's 444.  I've typed `bsvup --file localdirectory --subdirectory

that into my script for now.  Hey, the local folder is the same as the
remote folder!  That's great!  It's 448 .
Done.  449.  Let's test this out.
Ran it but nothing happened.  Reviewing content.
I need to pass a command to bsvup in addition to flags.
bsvup --file "$dir" --subdirectory "$dir" upload
It's 451.
I ran it!  It's checking whether the files "exist" on the chain.  I think
this code might be partly broken.  It's harmless since none of them are
likely to, that I am aware of.
It's checking a lot of files and could run into API rate limits, which
could break the upload.  No errors reported so far.  It's 452 .
While I wait,  I'll add the script to the git repo and upload it
somewhere.  My github account is the place that is the most psychologically
accessible to me.  It's 453.
It's 454 and I made  .
My bsvup run has finished reviewing the data.  Now I'm scrolling up to
check for any glaring problems, before confirming the upload.
The total price was set to 3620399 sat at a fee of 1 sat/byte.  The BSV
network will accept .25 sat/byte .  I'm going to restart it with 0.5
sat/byte, which is what its default API server requires last I remember
(maybe a year or two ago).  It's 457.
bsvup --file "$dir" --subdirectory "$dir" --rate 500 upload
While that's running again, I'll split the script into two.  One to update
the local archive, and another to do the trial upload.  It's 459.
It's 500 PM and I've uploaded the two scripts to the github repository.
The test upload is still re-checking for existence.
Seems like waiting and focusing on my task is what to do now.
The existence checks finished.  Reviewing.
Total price: .01946 bsv somehow.
I just remembered I need to include the bsv address in the git repo.  Maybe
I'll remember when I finish this upload review.
I started the upload.  It's about a thousand transactions total.  It's
503.  While it's running, I'll add the bsv stuff to the git repo, including
the encrypted private key.
Y'know, maybe I'll keep it encrypted, and set the password to something
I'll have to set up a test folder to see if I can change the passphrase
from an empty string without destroying it.  It's 504.  The upload has
exhausted the server mempool and is still in progress, waiting for the next
I'm setting up a notes pane to write down what I figure out about the
encryption key, since I don't remember things when I look away from them.
I often don't even remember that I have that issue, but I'm familiar with
trying to use a computer while having it.  It's 506.
goal: change a bsvup encryption key
note: --key lets one set a key, likely WIF
note: I do not see a way to export a key
I'm thinking what would be most effective here would be to use the nodejs
terminal or write a quick nodejs script that loads bsvup as a library and
calls its internals to change the paraphrase.  It's 509.
Step 1: find functions for saving loading key, in current bsvup install.
`type -p bsvup`.
readlink --canonicalize /bin/bsvup
It uses its Cache module, calling loadKey(password) to load the key.  It's
There is also Cache.saveKey(key, password).  Sounds easy.  It's 512.
At the top of the file, I see Cache is the result of
So the module I need is /usr/lib/node_modules/bsvup/cache.js .
Thirsty again.  513 PM.
I started mutating the key, but I should note the test address first so I
can verify mutation didn't alter it.
K.  It's in my notes pane.  515 Pm.
Let's mutate this encrypted key, as a test.
I mutated it without harm with:
c = require('/usr/lib/node_modules/bsvup/cache.js')
c.saveKey(key.loadKey(oldpass), newpass)
I'll back up my real key before mutating it.  It's 517.
I think I mutated it successfully.  I'll check that block explorer url to
see if the address is right.  It's 519.
Yes, it looks correct.  I'll add it to the github repository.  I just
realized that I'm not aware of any inproxies that will display the D:// url
this upload will make, although I have been out of the loop for a while, so
I'll also want to make an index page to see the content.  Anyway, d:// urls
are mutable and can be misleading.  It's 521.
I added the keyfile to the git repo, so the script would likely at least
run if somebody else tried it, and had bsvup installed, which may be on
npm, but likely a different version.  It's 524 pm.
946 transactions are left to broadcast.  I'll work on making that index
Reminder to self:  this subfolder is
It looks like the html files use relative urls often, which is great.  Many
of the url are absolute, too, though.
Since I'm mirroring the folder structure I could mutate arbitrary links to
direct transaction ids using a tool I made that I forget the name of at the
moment.  Something about bsv.  It's 529.
I guess I'll want to mutate the threads, authors, etc html files.  Maybe
make files sitting alongside them?  It would be nice if the whole list were
archived referencing transactions.  That would take some hacking to figure
out the ids before uploading, and might be unreasonable due to circular
linking.  I could make a page that mutates on the fly using javascript...
I'll just mutate the index pages for now.  It's 532.
I'll use sed to extract urls.  I'll put it in a script and find my tool
once I have the urls.
Y'know, to fix the weird interdependencies,  I should mutate them a certain
way.  Individual message pages can have navigation links removed.
Navigation pages can have links to navigation removed.  Then every
navigation link can be a transaction id.
I'll just bite the bullet and accept that that means I'm uploading
undesired data.  Maybe I can make it flexible, to use this data now and use
new data if I make new data.
So, first check if a link has a mutated version, then if it has a normal
version.  Pages are in categories that can be identified with functions.
Each category has some links disabled.
It's 546.  I'm looking up how to provide alternates to sed's grouping
556.  The index pages have urls that cross linebreaks, breaking sed.
Blargh.  This incredibly common issue should be fixed inside sed but never
will be.  Hmm.  558 I found a sed hack that will work.
K.  I got the links fillered and listed with sed.  Now to find my tool.
It's in that same xloem user on github.  Bitfiles! Yay.  602 pm.
not installed on my system.  I'll try npm.
sudo npm install -g bitfiles
Hey!  A block got confirmed!  More transactions are sending.  It's 604 pm.
Maybe we can get more up by being first in the mempool.
I hope this version of bsvup has the transaction confirmation patch I
added.  It's looking like it _doesn't_, so some files may need
reuploading.  I can probably upload them by upgrading bsvup and changing
them to pending.  I should probably do that after the upload, if I can.
Luckily, bitfiles --help outputs something, which is not often true of
scripts I quickly create.  It looks like I can find a direct link to a file
using something like `bitfiles status d://address/path' .
My phone is at 15% battery.  I'll plug it into this computer?  Nah all the
ports are clogged with confused storage devices.  I'll grab a flaky backup

Plugged.  609 pm.  Phone glitched a little.
Adding bitfiles to script.
Awww ... bitfiles crashes when run.  This usually happens quickly when I
stop maintaining something.
Oh!  The error is just that the files aren't found yet; still uploading
maybe.  Yay.
Yeah bsvup uploads the D:// record last ... hmm ...
I'm running it on all the links, sending stderr to /dev/null, just in case.
The unuploaded transactions are stored locally ... but I don't have an
interface made to work with them that way.  And I'm not running a bsv node;
it takes longer to sync than my computer can run without crashing.
It's 614.  I'll upload my half-made script to github in case I forget I'm
doing this.
Uploaded.  It's 616 and I'm getting worn.
We don't actually need the D url for anything.  Only the actual transaction
ids.  The transactions are stored in the .bsv folder, and bsvup likely has
library functions for accessing them on some level.
The D transactions store the path information.  I believe each file has its
own D transaction.  So, the way to find a file is by enumerating them all.
In nodejs, I think the bsv library can parse the transactions.  ...
struggling to continue ...
It's only 619.  My arms feel soggy; it takes a lot of effort to make them
obey me.
The D format is based on the bytecode within the outputs of a transaction.
It's a set sequence of data opcodes.  I most recently worked with it in
python, adding reading functionality to a lib with pluggable API backends.
I'm thinking I'll add something to bitfiles rather than adding to that.
Bitfiles usually uses a bitquery server to find transactions, which I don't
have, so maybe I'll just write something handmade quickly.  It's 622.
Okay.  Go through every transaction that .bsv has.  Find the D://
transactions, and identify a filepath.  Use nodejs to read the bsvup data,
since I can copy code from bsvup and bitfiles.
Step 1: make a script, and enumerate the bsvup transactions.
Hey wait!  Bsvup just finished broadcasting!
It did not check for confirmations.  So some files are likely dropped.  But
it caches its broadcasts.  It's 624.
I'm wondering if bitfiles has bug where everything is not found.
It's outputing no D transactions from that address at all.  Time to clone
its repo.  Hey, I already have a checkout!  It's 626.
I'll check a specific transaction hash.  In bitfiles you can check a TX
with `bitfiles status TX://hash` .
It looks the API server isn't replying.  It's a bsv API server that was
deprecated by the maintainer and replaced by another.  I have a branch
where I abstracted the backend out but never managed to complete that.  I
wonder if I can find the new server ... maybe my branch is on this system?
I don't think I ever uploaded it but maybe I did?
I did upload it =) git worktree add wip origin/wip .
bitbus was the next server!  Let's see if I can backport the changes.  It's
633 and I have a headache.  But my arms are feeling better.
There's a funny thing in here.  After I started working with bsv, they
updated the protocol so all transactions mutated.  To read both old and new
data, you have to support both forms now.  It's a little confusing.  It's
I copied this code from bsvup, keeping a lot of the same format because I
was so confused.  It seems easier to work on things successfully when
chunks are copied from or referencing other things. Obviouslyreferg .  My
phone glitches a bit.  It's 639.
I'm having difficulty continuing.  I've written the main query retriever
for bitbus.  I know it doesn't work because I haven't tested it, and I
always make bugs.  It's 644.
I'll add a comment that it's wip and upload it to bitfiles.  I'll also ask
the maintainer of the old API server if he could give it a kick, and ask if
there are other tools for checking d:// transactions.
I'm remembering polyglot, the python code I worked on a little, might do
that, now.  Maybe I won't ask that guy yet.  It's 646.
I uploaded the changes.  Let's look for polyglot.
The polyglot cli tool does upload only.
The download source does not do d:// transactions yet.  They are not
complicated.  The effort is comparable to the backporting attempt.
I'm getting pretty confused now.  It's 651.
I'm thinking of looking at the bsvup transactions manually to find their
references.  Each one has its path as a string, and the txid.  I can grep
them for the path.
I'm going to get food and water.  I have emptied my 20 oz 592 ml water
bottle and my mouth still feels dry.  It's 653 pm.
Back.  659.
I didn't remember what I was doing, but finally noticed I  was staring
blankly at a description of it that I'd written.  On to grepping.
The txt are stored in hexadecimal, probably to ease dev effort sending them
to an API server.  I use xxd -r -ps to decode them.
sed doesn't match binary characters with '.' :-/ .  It's 704 and I am
ravenously eating this food.
The txid is terminated by a \x01 character in my example transaction.
I google the issue and learn of the trick of passing the data through
The D transactions have an ascii identifier in them.
All the D txids are preceded by an @ sign.
I form a regex and it extracts a lot of message TX ids but none of the
index page txids, so there's a bug.  It's 714 pm.
One of the characters in my regex represents the pathname link.  I change
it to a '.'.
It now finds every path and txid.  I add it to the script to not lose it.
I test one of the txids and it works.  It was randomly a post by me.  I'll
qrencode it to transfer to this phone and link it here.
Blockchained cpunks post:
It's 7:21 pm.
Okay.  So link mutation should be reasonable now.  No bitfiles needed.
It's 723 pm.  I'm having trouble continuing.  I finished my food.
It's 725.  I've accessed the mutation script again, and altered it to
output the link list.  I need to mutate the links into the D paths I made,
which means making them absolute if not, and prepending the hostname.  I'm
having trouble continuing.  I keep losing things in my working memory while
trying to work.
I don't remember what I'm doing.  Something about bsvup.  Paths.  Mutating
I have to do something to mutate links.
In the text file, I have a function that produces a list of path and txid
I plan to store its output in a file, and regenerate the file when there is
a miss, maybe.
Right now,  I want to make the links absolute.  The next step is to run the
script, and look at the output.  I just did that.  I'm doing it again.
It's 7:29.
Relative links start with a nonslash character.  They are to be preceded
with the dirname of the path, which should also be relative.
Script now finds txid for links.  739.
745.  I have the bash script mutating all the links in a pipe.  I'm not
sure yet how to form a mutated output name, but it shouldn't be too hard.
751.  Figured out output name.  I'm thinking on adding a link to original
files, in mutated files.  Maybe in some part of the visible html.  Working
on a bug in finding transformed names.
754 the bug was a logic error that I have fixed but still don't understand
or remember.
759 working on a sed bug where links aren't being filtered from individual
messages.  Having difficulty continuing.
The sed script is to match everything.  Oh, maybe I found the error.
Nope.  But here's another, links that break lines again.
Okay.  It's 8:34 pm and this link mutation bash hack is working.  I
uploaded it to git.  It processes only a single file and is kinda slow.
The immediate suspect for slowness would be running a while loop that
processes each link one by one, each one using shell commands.
I suppose if I want to upload all these mutated pages I'll have to put
another $2 in the account.  First I'll look to see if I can link to the
original file easily.
It seems it could work fine to insert an  tag at the start or end of the
body, like the footer does.
8:58 .  I'm working with a confusing bug adding the link back to the
original where output inside a pipe seems to disappear inside the pipe.
Maybe it would be easiest to just do it a different way.
9:11 pm.  Link-to-original seems to be working.  I may have added bugs to
the script and am not sure how to detect this reliably.  While it remutates
all the messages to not link to each other, since the links would change
the transaction hash, I'll transfer another $2 in.
9:25 .  The mutation finished.  Some of the inter-messages links are broken
at the end.  I was planning on attending an event in 5 minutes but do not
have access to it.  I uploaded a basic readme to the git repo I made.
9:28 The broken links are fine; they weren't supposed to work yet.  Setting
the data uploading.
9:36 it wants to upload the existing files =(   I will just move them for
9:40 uploading from subfolder.  If I'm awake when this finishes, I want to
try to remember to upgrade bsvup and check that all the transactions
confirmed.  Many transactions may be nonrebroadcastable because I am doing
multiple upload runs, which could respend unspent change.
944 the individual message upload is running.  I'm thinking I'll go to
bed.  Maybe if I leave this email draft open, I'll resume.
950 I went to drop the backlight on the laptop and saw a block was
confirmed.  Thinking all the transactions are likely to get in the mempool
10:00 pm. I measured the speed and it should finish before 10:10 .
The reason these tools are so crummy on my end is because I get nasty
flashbacks when working on them, so I look for the quickest and easiest
result.  Ideally an upload tool would be written in something more robust
than nodejs and bash, and connect directly to the p2p network.  I don't
know where to find something like that, and getting this far has been very
difficult.  There are a lot of protocol changes that could be made to drop
the price, too.
I remembered the tool that has D protocol details in it.  It was by the
same guy who made bsvup ... a small inproxy.
18 transactions left.  With more attention here, the bcat protocol could be
used to splice together the same webpage parts for the two different kinds
of pages, so the double uploads wouldn't be needed.  That would of course
need a custom uploader.
Uh-oh ... still uploading after those 18.  Guess I had the total wrong
Finished at 10:11.  Let's mutate those index files.
10:12 mutated with no crashing !
10:14 uploading these index files.  Done.
Let's try 'em out.
Dang.  The transactions show two thread index files that differ, neither of
them saying .txlink .  I think I made an error uploading.
1017 yeah I had uploaded the same files.  Likely it is only the transaction
ids that are different.
1019 reuploading
1020 the mutated indices are up but the mutation is wrong.  The message
links are broken.
Debug mutation.
Looks like the same bug as before.  Sed script not survive pipe.
Missing dollar sign.  Was writing to variable name instead of content.
Links look good locally now.  Regenerate, reupload.
It's funny to look at computer screens for me.  When things change on the
screen, my eyes deconverge and I see double.  I've gotten used to it, just
looking at things with one eye when it happens.  Sometimes I forget to
reconverge them, since when they're staying that way it can't initiate
1027 verified the links locally in a browser.  Reuploading.
1029 the API server mempool ran out with one transaction remaining.  Gotta
wait for next block.
1034 the indices that have already been broadcast are working.
10:36 I tried to delete the transactions from my cache that had the wrong
content so that links won't be formed to them if I continue.
Let's share the links to the indices.
Now 10:45p, transferring links.

Thank you Cecilia.
Do you practice magic or any rituals?  I felt guided to start designing
some ritualistic spells and prayers and it was helping me a lot.  It took a

I was also listening to nature meditations.

TLDR: I didn't get very far today, but it was lots of fun to spend the
whole day trying.  Not sure how well I can repeat it.
It's 2020-12-05T08:26:11-0500, and I'm looking for a recording of
Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier, semi-oppressive music I've listened to a
lot, that helps my brain do more things.  It's semi-oppressive because
its feelings share history mostly from old white male europeans, who
are already sharing most of the history.
I had trouble doing anything but editing my expression above.  It's 08:28.
I'm dropping the goal of finding the music because I have too many
things on my plate now, struggling to resist my experiences.
Let's trim this quote below:
 This is actually someone else PR was quoting, but I know he is
also feeling it somewhere in his heart, too.
It's 08:30 .  I apologise for spamming your list, but it seems to be
letting me store a lot of things on a blockchain, and having so much
amnesia I really, really love to do that.
I'd also like to take some time to express the value for other

express myself in ways that respect them, but I am being selfish, and
working with blockchains instead.  I know they can help my memory
It's 08:31 and I'm daydreaming about frustration around repeatedly
destroying all my own records.  Let's make a TODO list:
- music? [please-decide: from phone or from computer] [i-pick phone]

- upgrade bsvup so transactions confirmations are verified. note the
current version so as to return if the new version is broken.
- add attachments to mailing list uploading.

Forgot goal.  Upgrade bsvd -- no.  Find current bsvup version.  Open a
notes pane and place it in.
Yesterday I was using bsvup version 1.6.8 .  The npm integrity hash is
.  The tarball shasum is 5d9017204005a692cce247c7cc33ec834ff98ad2  and
its url is  .
Okay!  Let's upgrade bsvup.  First, I'm typing this on my computer now
somehow, instead of on my phone.  I use gmail's basic HTML view, so
that my system freezes and misbehaves at a rate that increases more
slowly.  But I'll want automatic draft saving, so I'll switch to
standard view.
[blips out of existence while saving draft]
[blips back].  It's 08:38 .
Goal was .. upgrade bsvup!
I'm used to using bsvup from its git repo.  I'll use the latest
release from there, maybe.
sudo npm -g uninstall bsvup
cd ~/src/bsvup
git pull
git pull is just hanging, not sure why.
curl -v google.com
also hanging.  Implies no nameserver responses.  The wifi where I'm at
is high strength, and I just loaded the gmail javascript page fine.
google.com now loads; git says 'empty response from server'.  It's
hosted at github.com .
git pull
Already up to date.  Great!
git status
Dang I have a lot of unsaved changes.  I wonder what the latest
version is, and what they are.
git branch
This is the main branch, which is kindly being renamed from a slavery word.
I guess I'll just use npm's latest version for now.  I often need to
fix bugs though.
sudo npm install -g bsvup
I wanted to use my changes, which look harmless, but that seemed much
harder to continue to do.  It's 08:43.
Ohhhh it reinstalled version 1.6.8 .  This is so strange!  I added
transaction confirmations to bsvup so very long ago.  Maybe they're
not on npm?
git blame package.json
The 1.6.8 line is marke March 29, 2020.  It should have this, I think?
 I don't remember?  It's 08:44
Inhibited.  Looking for music on my phone.
It's 08:45 .  I plugged my headphones into my phone, but I'm not sure
how to play music on it.  There must be a music app.  Back to bsvup.
Goal: transaction confirmation.  Check git history from master branch
to see what date it was merged or whatnot.
grep -r onfirm . | grep -v node_modules
No helpful results.
Maybe I can find the branch where I dev'd it.
git branch
Don't see anything helpful.
K.  Goal: transaction confirmation changes.  It's 08:47 .  I remember
.... that I added this ... to a loop that waits.  It relates to ....
unconfirmed transactions.
I changed the unconfirmed transaction mechanism to use a subfolder
instead of a json file, so transaction files could be moved between
subfolders etc.  I'm not certain that this change was in my
contribution.  This subfolders are managed in cache.js .
less cache.js
I recognise the loadTXList here as something I likely added for this.
It's a function, my brain dropped that word.
The saveUnbroadcast function here looks like it includes the changes I
remember.  This is not how 1.6.8 was behaving yesterday.  It was
saving unbroadcasted transactions in a single .json file.  I review
the function again, to verify it doesn't do that.  It's 08:50 .  Yes,
it saves them individually in an 'unbroadcasted' folder.  I copied the
morphemes used by the chinese project owner.
git blame cache.js # it's 08:50, still
My changes are dated 05-10 .  So there simply hasn't been a release
with them, yet.  If I added a package.json file to the uploader repo,
I could have it reference the git branch, and use that.  That'll be
the goal for now I suppose, so we get transaction confirmations.
Inhibited.  08:51
Inner dialogue.  Inner emotional landscape.  Believing you are mind
controlled can be rough.  It's 08:52 .
The spirit of open source is to contribute.  Rather than forking bsvup
and making a new release, we hope that the project owner can find the
harmony to make one, or to at least ask for a new maintainer.  They
invited me to co-maintain the project but I think I was too slow
following up on it or understanding it, and I think I am not a
maintainer anymore.  At least, I don't have their npm account to cut
an npm release at this time.
Right now, let's set up the git r -- let's plan to set up the git
repository to reference a git commit id for bsvup.  First let's test
one of them.  I wonder if npm can install a commit id?
sudo npm install -g
Hey, that seems to be working great!  I have it written above if it
works and I want to add it to the readme.  It's 08:55.  This person
would probably make a release if I asked them.
k.  Let's test the new bsvup.  Ummmmm if I reupload the same folder
from yesterday, it should say that no files changed, I hope?
While it checks all those files I'm going to continue reviewing my
bsvup changes, to see if I can get the repository in order for
handling new bugs I encounter.
- I've changed the transfer function, so that the fee rate can be set.
It also reports how many utxos are bound together; that's probably
temporary for debugging.
  This looks like a mistake in the fee implementation, missed when it
was improved.  Should be turned into a small PR.  This is in api.js
and cli.js .
- I've added an option -e, --rename to provide for uploading single
files with different names than they have locally.  Calls
logic.prepareUpload in cli.js .
  The rename changes in logic.js aren't easy for me to verify as being correct.
I think I'll separate the two changes and push them as branches.  I'll
try using the transfer fee one as a norm and submit it once I learn it
It's 0901.  Inhibited again.  More inner landscapes.  Eating food as a
distraction.  Maybe I can find a music app installed on my phone
somewhere.  Haven't found yet.  Back to workplay.  0902.
Whoops!  Suddenly very thirsty.  Water's right here.  Okay.  0903.
NOW.  GOAL.  What is goal.  Don't remember.
Relates bsv-up.  Repo is messy.  Split changes out while test runs.
git stash # to save them in case i make some error
git stash apply # to bring them back
git checkout -b # uhhhh .......
looking for what-i-am-doing to make branch name.  What am I doing?
Working with 2 changes.  Want to start with smaller one.  Is described
above.  First item above.  Need name for.  It's 0905.
Sets fee rate for transfer function.  transfer-fee will be branch name.
git checkout -b transfer-fee
git diff # to see changes
I keep git diff open in one pane, and remove the unrelated changes in
another tmux pane.  Tmux was hard to learn (i was used to screen), but
it can do
vertical splits much more readily.  It's also much higher level and
seems buggier and sloppier to me.  I would prefer to use the vsplit
patch to screen, in retrospect.
Hey, the test run finished.  It is trying to upload a ton of existing
files =/  so fixing the existing function would really help here.
Reconsidering approach.  I think to contribute the most, I'm going to
skip this task for now and switch to adding attachments.  Can upload
special subfolders to work around the issue of existing.  I can also
add the tx files to git-annex so that others can reuse them.
First I will check the transactions for unconfirmed.  I _think_ I can
do that, with this new bsvup version, by moving them from .bsv/tx to
.bsv/unconfirmed.  Checking the source to see if that's right.  No,
it's .bsv/unbroadcasted .  I'll move them there and see what it
mkdir .bsv/unbroadcasted
mv .bsv/tx/* .bsv/unbroadcasted -v
Now bsvup prompts to resume the unbroadcasted transactions.  Let's see
how it goes.
They are all failing with missing inputs.  This is probably a new
server api quirk for transactions that are already onchain.  The
inputs are not in some pool of unspent transactions.  Blargh.  My
confirmations changes aren't working any more.
Okay, I'm just going to push my present changes to a branch that has
htem merged together, to store them somewhere.
git checkout -b transfer-fee-and- # blargh ... what is the other
change?  let's scroll up. renaming.  it's 0911.
git bechkout -b transfer-fee-and-rename
git add *.js
git commit -m 'changes found in my dir'
git push xloem
git checkout master
K, nice and clean to figure out this confirmation issue.  I'll search
for the error message.  'the transaction was rejected by network
rules' .  Not present, must be generated by server.
Inhibition.  It's 09:13.  'MatterCloud API return Errors'.  I'll
search for that.  Happens in api.js , in broadcastInsight function.
This function has a lot of legacy content because the api provider
keeps on changing things and available energy is small.
Looks like I have unsaved api.js changes.  Those should go in the
transfer-fee-and-rename branch.  I noticed my vision was double and
converged my eyes, which is nice.
git checkout transfer-fee-and-rename
vi api.js
git diff api.js
No changes.
rm .api.js.swp
git checkout master
vi api.js
Back to workplay.
K.  Refresh goal.  It's 0917.  Trying to figure out how to detect
confirmed transactions with api changes.  Finding what now ....
broadcastInsight is called from the broadcast() function.  I've done
this before so the parts have familiarity.  It's still hard to find
broadcast is called from tryBroadcastAll .  I vaguely recall that a
merge here broke some logic once.  I don't know if that's been
Here's the issue.  It's still using BitDB to check if the transaction
exists, and BitDB is that same service the maintainer deprecated.
Obviously the right solution
is to connect to an actual node.  There's even a node API service used
by electrum, where you can connect to many api servers that use all
the same api protocol.  But they don't offer the bitquery service that
bitdb and bitbus do, which are open source.
It doesn't matter what to do here.  I'll try bitbus since bsvup uses
bitdb in other places, too.
I'll try to change _just_ the exists function, to use the abstraction
template I added a while ago, that isn't linked in yet.  I'll also
actually contact the owner of bitdb, and ask them to reboot it.
They're in some 'atlantis' chat ....  websearching 'atlantis bitdb' i
find that it's a Slack.  I bet it's already open if I go to Slack.
It's 0921.
Slack has heavy javascript so I'll use it on my phone which is less
critical than this laptop atm.
I have unread messages from the polyglot maintainer.  There's value
around using electrumsv-sdk .  It's 0923; I have a lot of thoughts
bouncing in.
Contact person who runs bitdb.  Maybe in general chat.  Find their
name to tag them in a message.
Haha there is a recent big long thread from KarlTheProgrammer, another
one like me, but they are expressing criticism that doesn't seem
contextual, which is weird.  Yeah, the chain is full of thousands of
spammy transactions.  It's because we can barely code anything.
Assistance certainly welcome.
This person hasn't sent a message for a while.  I suddenly remember
their name.  I ping them in a new message.  "is there any chance you
could give bitdb a reboot so legacy stuff can get some requests
through?  I am working on upgrading to bitbus, electrumsv, local
nodes, but it is very hard for me; I don't understand the code well.
It would be nice to get a few more transactions through."
It's 0928.  Next task: move the existence-checking function to use the
abstraction I already made.
I'll want to copy the findTx function from bitdb.js, and mutate it for
bitbus.  I did some of this mutation already yesterday for bitfiles,
which still has similar code.
The key bit might be the queryTx function.  This generates a bitquery
request for a single tx id.  bitbus has slightly different bitquery
norms than bitdb.  I'll look up what they are.
It's 09:32 and I'm reading the bitbus query doc at doc.bitbus.network
.  It looks like the "v" version field is not needed.  It mostly links
to straight the bitquery documentation.
That wasn't helpful.  Looks like he bitquery limitations in bitbus are
listed farther down in bitbus's docs.  It's 0935.  It supports "q"
find, limit, sort, and project.  "r" queries and aggregate queries are
not supported.  This should be fine for txExist.  Yes, queryTx doesn't
use "r".  This should go smoothly!  0937.
Getting really pushy, attempts to use my working memory.  It's 09:39.
Relaxing, letting the urge wipe everything just a little.  It's all
nearby on my screen.
Working on making bitbus work to check transaction existence in
monkeylord's thingie ... bsvup.  Ongoing goal: find bitbus usage
Inner landscape stuff.  It's rough, believing in mind control.
Distractions.  It's 09:40.
Ongoing goal: find bitbus usage within bitfiles, copy method of
sending request.  Here we are.  It's 09:41 and I'm copying the request
headers over.
I manually set my tabs to 2 spaces.  It's important to copy the style
of an existing computer program, when working on it.
It uses node-fetch.  I want to send a post request, so I'll look up
how to do that with node-fetch.. Pass { 'method': 'POST', 'body': data
}.  09:43.
Existing usage calls an asynchronous function to convert to json
(await result.json()).  Let's see how I can skip over that in
node-fetch, since bitbus is ndjson that wouldn't parse.  await
result.text() .  Great.
0946.  I've made the bitbus function that mirrors bitdb and am trying
to verify that it is what I meant to do.  I'm having trouble focusing.
Water.  More inhibition.  Inner landscape.  More water.   Back to workplay.
The function I made shold be called .............. txQuery?  I think
there's a txExists function below it.  Let's see.  Nope, findTx.  Now,
add findExist.  Uses a queryHash function that I'd better move over.
queryHash uses 'r' queries, unfortunately.  Maybe I can change the
abstraction path to skip this for now.
queryHash looks kind of important.  bsvup uses a hack that looks maybe
like it was made to quickly handle existence checking without
reviewing the whole ecosystem of technologies.  It names the files
based on their checksums, and looks for files with those names to see
if they already exist.  Is that what we want here?
It's vulnerable to people uploading fake transactions.  So it should
check that the data matches the hash.  That's not too hard, but not a
priority atm.
The 'r' filter shows the fields that are expected to be transmuted.
We can move that behavior outside of the query, and do it in
The hash used is sha1.  I have enough information now to migrate the
whole function, and the way it is done can inform migrating the rest
It's 09:55 and I'm partway through the migration of the functoin.
Inhibition.  Inner landscape, briefly.  More inner landscape.
Internal issue referenced with frustration.  Inner healing !  Brief.
Sense of everything changing.  Fits of laughter.  Distraction.
It's 09:56.  Inner learning situation.  We take some time to shift our
attitude, to be more respectful and meaningful.  Brief meditation.
Distraction.  Inhibition.  Laughter.  It's 09:57.  I have a sense of
learning what is truly important in the world.  I try to hold it to
the side while continuing to develop software.  It's 09:58.
I feel much better but it's hard to act.  What am I working on?
Migrating findExist.  I copied the 'r' query portions to turn them
into javascript code.  Copying them down into a loop.  The 'r' and
'r2' are handled differently; here's this protocol shift again.  Need
a different loop for each query result.
Inhibition.  10:00a.
10:01a.  Back to workplay!
10:04 .  Struggling to continue.
I should limit the returnde data using a 'project' field, to manage bandwidth.
I see the query is using a '$or' field.  This might be 'aggregate'
which is what it doesn't support.  I'll check.  Maybe not.  10:08.
I think I'll continue by testing it.  I'll need an sha1sum of an
uploaded file, and a txid.  I guess I might as well put it in the
abstraction, and test with that?  Either one.
oh wow the abstraction is better than my copying.  Just test it for now.
1013.  More inhibition.  Testing I find there's a blank line at the
end that is crashing when turning to json.  Probably normal for
ndjson.  Gotta remove that.
1015.  Froze my debug shell with an infinite loop, somehow.  When I
killed the process my ctrl-Ds went through and killed the terminal
1018.  bitbus.findTx returns correct data for a present transaction.
It crashes for a nonpresent one.
1021.  bitbus.findTx passes both adhoc tests.  Looking for an sha1sum.
It takes data, not an sha1sum.  Need data to test.  Maybe copy file
into working dir and open.
1024 findExist fails to find existing file.  I'll check the tx
manually, and see if it should succeed.
1025 The hash is being calculated correctly inside the function.
1027 I can see this hash is also correctly inside the transaction at
So, I'm probably sending a bad request to bitbus.  I can debug that
with curl, I suppose.
1031.  Still trying to craft curl request.  Inner landscape stuff.  It
is rough believing in mind control and human trafficking.  Why,
believing in human trafficking can get you very worried.  Luckily we
have beautiful sunrises.
1036.  My curl request is returning the correct data, so the error is
likely in the procesing of the results, or a typo that is hard to see
or soemthing.  My inner landscape wants to hire me to work in a secret
hacker thing, rather than me working on this.  It is rough believing
in coercion.  Sunrises.
1037. 1038. Distraction.  Goal: output result of query, so we can
bisect where the issue is.  By bisect I mean when divide an array in
the middle, and it's sorted.
1039.  Found what is likely the issue by inspection.
1041.  Fixed another error that is basically the same thing (leaving 2
out when copying a block of code, skipping the cognitive difficulties
of abstracting their similarity out)
1042.  Fixed another error of exactly the same kind, which I fixed and
then put back while fixing the last.
1042.  findExist works correctly now.
Whew.  findExist returns the txid of transactions that could contain
passed data, since they have the sha1 tag.  So downloading those
transactions and checking the content could be done outside the
function if needed, I suppose.  Maybe I'll rename it to
findMightContain in bitbus.
10:44 it is snowing.  Snow break.
Laundry moved to dryer.  Peed.  1048.
There's more laundry.  It's okay.
K.   I made bitbus functions that emulate bitdb functions.  I guess,
for the project, I should mkae the 1 remaining bitdb function a bitbus
I mentioned karma to Zenaan earlier.  When I rename findExist to
findMightContain, that's karmic motion.  It lets people learn about
and act on the danger held in the error inside findExist.  Gives it
more avenues than mysterious exploitation and confusion.
With cultural change and such, the sutff like findMightContain gets
more meta, where people act on pushing influence around because of
their shit, instead of just producing the influence directly from the
shit.  There's a lot of that now it seems.
It's 1054 and I have no idea what I am talking about.
It's 1059.  I found a long-standing bug inside the implementation
where D history is misordered.  Fixing by making sorting more complex.
I am unsure that my change is helpful.  Maybe the bug is a feature.
It's 11:01.  Also, make up your own karmic meaning.  Mine is made up.
It's 11:02.
11:04.  the final function, findD, is working correctly for missing
files, multiply-uploaded files, and single files.
I'll enable one abstraction and just migrate all the ohter uses of
bitdb straight over.
Hmm.  This looks like it is making the project a little more complex,
when it is already spaghettid, because it is not enough refactoring to
reach the point of increased organization.  Unfortunate.  But it's
helpful to introduce abstractions =S
Where do I use this in the code.  Scrolling up.  It's 11:10 .
Scrolling up is confusing.  Let's see.  Trying to resolve findExist
not working.  Let's see where that's used, and change it.
1127.  I ended up moving all the new api funcs into the abstraction.
They are now working using a pluggable backend handler.
1131.  I'm installing my dev folder to see if it works.  I don't
usually install things to test them.
1132. Didn't work.  Running the script by path like normal.
1133. It's confirming transactions great =)  I guess I'll remove the
old functions from the files, so they can use the centralised
1139 I pushed my bsvup changes to github.
1143 I submitted a PR at Additionally, the new script verified that all uploaded transactions
were accepted into the blockchain.
1144 I'm attempting the reupload again, and this time it is correctly
skipping every file because the file is already on-chain.
Remind myself of goal: attachment data.
1145 wrote something and erased it around pushing myself harder.
1147 I realized to not "make the karma bit explode into harm", I
should modify the output of the script so it reports to the user that
the file it finds could have been spoofed in some subtle way.
1152 thinking on how so many problems would be resolved if we would
share important information better on a huge scale.  similar to the
sha1 thing.  trying to focus on workplay.  next step was ....
attachment data!  I can look at an email with an attachment to see
where that is.
1154 the bsvup reupload finished.  it says the four nonmutated indices
don't have path records on the chain, but do have their data uploaded.
I'm sure I caused that somehow, but I don't know how that would happen
unless they were uploaded with the wrong paths.  Maybe it is because I
removed their txs from the tx folder?  Did I do that?  I think I
removed other txs, not those.
It's generally some human error in things like that.  I'm going to
cancel the upload and focus on attachments.
1156 I haven't downloaded the attachments.  I don't know whether they
are linked if a spider crawls from the front page, so I'll add
mirroring them to the download script.
1201 my wget spider didn't download any attachments and has already
found the big mbox file.  i can download them manually to test
uploading and linking them from the existing script. (i just did
download the september 2020 ones manually)
1205 bsvup is processing uploading my attachments subfolder, which is
slow because the spider downloaded an index file for every single day.
while it does that, i'd like to figure out why the four index files
aren't found with the right D (path) records.
how to do this?  how about i migrate the bitbus changes from bsvup,
over to bitfiles.  i'm used to its interface.
blargh bitfiles has different structure.  maybe I can do a manual
bitquery to find those files, instead.  i can copy the query from that
used by bsvup, and maybe there is an online explorer or i can use the
nodejs shell.  the sha1 is in one specific field; it will be the
'genesis' form of the protocol.
1210.  Inner landscapes.  It is scary to believe in human trafficking,
mind control, and coercion.  Very scary.  But all we are dealing with
is a small debugging task.
1212.  I am sitting blankly, trying to focus on doing a task.  I could
use something to look at to remind me what it is, I think.  I don't
remember what it is.
I am trying to move bsvup-source near wrong-or-missing-D-records of 4
original index files.  That is, I'm trying to ... find the part of
bsvup, in bitbus.js, where
it ... makes a D record query.
I already have bitbus.js open!
Oh no.  I moved the query from here.  It is in ... backends.js .  Here it is.
This is the 'genesis' format query (they renamed the bsv version to
'genesis' when they changed the protocol).  {
    'v': 3,
    'q': {
      'find': {
        'in.e.a': address || undefined,
        'out.s3': key || undefined,
        'out.s2': '19iG3WTYSsbyos3uJ733yK4zEioi1FesNU'
      },
      'project': {
        'out.s3': 1,
        'out.s4': 1,
        'out.s5': 1,
        'out.s6': 1,
        'in.e.a': 1,
        'blk.i': 1
      }
    }
  }
It's hard to format concisely and stay literally-transparent.  Ohhh
because I need to think about hte 'project' parts to figure out how to
mutate the 'find' parts.
Okay.  I guess we'll be setting 'in.e.a', the address, but leaving
'out.s3' unset so it can find the right key, and then'll I want to set
the transaction link, the content link, to the right value.  I'll
check bsvup's generation code to see what that is.
That's in uploadDTask in logic.js?  No, that's just a precursor.
Maybe this is it, in pendTasks.  Oh, it's in txutil.js, as buildDOut.
txUtil.js, capital U.
Looks like the 'value' field holds the transaction id.  I'll see how
it's encoded, probably just however bsv transactions are encoded.
Stored in the filedatum as dValue.  It seems highly likely that it's
the ascii hex transaction id.  Okay, which data index thingy is it.
It's the one right after the D identifier and the key (path).  It's
the 3rd.  Arright, scrolling up to look.  That would make it s4.
Let's craft this.
    'v': 3,
    'q': {
      'find': {
        'in.e.a': address,
        'out.s2': '19iG3WTYSsbyos3uJ733yK4zEioi1FesNU',
        'out.s4': datatxid
      }
    }
  }
now I just need the datatxid.  I can use the findMightExist function I
migrated, from the nodejs shell.  I need the content of the files in
1223.  Inner landscapes.  I wonder what we need to be able to do this
stuff without typing it all into an email to the cypherpunks list.
1224.  More distractions.
1224. I'm experiencing fake pain in my right eye.  My right eye
actually has severe pain from an eye issue I have, but I tend not to
feel that pain.  I am instead feeling kind of tame, irritating pain.
I want to erase 'kind of tame' so I do not get worse pain.
1225.  Navigating inner landscapes.  Goal repetition?  What's the
goal?  I don't remember and turn away when I look.  What is it?  Using
the findMightExist functoin to manually find the id of the four
original index files on the blockchain!
[user at localhost bsvup]$ node
Okay, that's open.  I'll want to move those 4 files into that bsvup
folder to open 'em easy.
1227.  We get to lubricate our eye!  Yay!  If I lubricate my eye 5
times a day for a week, it stops hurting.  Unfortunately when I build
the habit I forget it.  But that can change.
1229.  Back to workplay.
Noticed my attachment upload terminated due to insufficient balance,
which his normal.
The proposed additional payment of 6 million satoshis is reasonable.
Would be nice if it said the total cost.
1232.  Inner landscape started growing jokes.   These can grow big
because they are so much nicer than other stuff.  "We have reports of
brain damage, what do we do?"  "Is the brain damage caused by freaking
out about things too much?" "ummm ... That is the rumor, yes."
[people start freaking out about how to handle it]  "It is an
emergency to go back to workplay!  People are trying to manipulate us
not to, by calling things emergencies!"
1234.  After wildly tapping bright things on my phone as the screen
jumps around, I make it to my bittrex holdings.
1236.  I withdrew around $5 of bsv.  Bittrex is working better for me
than usual, which is great.  Worked better yesterday too, once I got
signed in.
I'll start the upload now so that it doesn't add too many files from
the spider that's still running, and found the attachments subfolders,
but is still just downloading indices.
1237.  Back to ... uh ... manually checking something to do with node.
Oh, I need to copy the files in.
1239!  Copied em!
Luckily, node is one of the interpreters that stores command history,
so I don't have to remember how to open and read from a file.
1240.  Now I get to paste in that bitquery.  Oh, no, first I need the
txid, I see after scrolling up.  Ummm mI find that with
1242.  Inner landscapes.  We're trying to think about whether or not
this is what we want to be doing right now.  But our attempts to
relate data internally are getting harmed, so we have a strong habit
of storing things externally.  We don't mean to be spamming this list,
and it's really inhibiting of our cognition to have that be the way to
do something we prefer.  1243.  Back to workplay.
1244.  Inner karls.  Karl says, we can do something else if we want
to.  But Karl likes developing behaviors around uploading things to
blockchains, because he has suffered so much around loss of records
and memories.  If you can help us work with fewer interruptions, that
would be great.  1244 Inner landscapes.  We have lubricated karl's
eye, sent him to the bathroom, and he has eaten and drank.  His
laundry is in the wash, but could use more transferring.  How about we
do laundry the next time an interruption grows big.  1245.  Back to
1245.  Inner landscapes.   There is a way to force him to urgently
pee.  I'm building it in support of laundry.  It makes him get up.
1245.  Back to workplay.
1246.  I've loaded all the transaction ids for the files into a nodejs
object, to find their keys.  Each has been uploaded twice already!
That means finding the keys of multiple files.  I bet javascript has
an array mapping function.
1248.  Inner landscapes.  I wonder what we want to let come out typing.
1248.  I am trying to map arrays.  What I am trying to do to them.  I
want to pass them to some kind of backends.js functoin that finds
their D keys.  Oh!  I need the bitquery object now.  Json.  Object in
Helpful to put it on one line.  { 'v': 3, 'q': { 'find': { 'in.e.a':
address, 'out.s2': '19iG3WTYSsbyos3uJ733yK4zEioi1FesNU', 'out.s4':
datatxid } } }
{ 'v': 3, 'q': { 'find': { 'in.e.a': address, 'out.s2':
'19iG3WTYSsbyos3uJ733yK4zEioi1FesNU', 'out.s4': record.txid } } }
Looks like that's not valid javascript.  Gotta remember how to make
javascript objects.
Works with some fiddling.  I'm going to try to open a notes pane and
migrate some of this there.  Made it at 12:53.
The files are correctly on the blockchain, it looks to me, and I'm
having trouble staying in the notes pane.  It's 12:56.
The transactions

... computer glitch . Anyway, that's one of the paths that is
mysteriously reuploading.
13:00.  My body is trying to do things that move me away from the
computer.  Goal I am holding is to run a test reupload (and to not
send it due to doublespends with existing upload in progress), and
debug why this file is not found to exist.
13:02 .  I'm getting ENOENT trying to upload the test file.  It
exists.  I must have made a typo I am missing.
13:03 .  Still getting ENOENT even though autocompletion provided the
file.  Looks like tyhe failed system call is 'stat'.  Maybe I can
'stat' it manually.
13:03 .  stat works fine on the path, size is 101088 bytes. inode is 219152420.
I guess I'll strace bsvup.
=) looks like it's a bsvup bug.  It's trying to read from the basename
of the file, with the same cwd.  What a relief!
13:07.  Inner landscapes. I'm guessing the bug has to do with
uploading a file instead of a folder, so I'll just upload the folder
to handle my urgency.
13:10.  Inner landscapes.  The harmful processes in the mind landscape
have proven to themselves that they can stop this within a reliable
timeframe and are taking action.  What do we do?  [ummmm I'll come
back to the cypherpunks email instead of the notes file.  Let's just
write down things that cause us to stop.] Ok.

it, the test runs much much faster, and I don't know why, maybe
because fewer checks are failing.
13:19 .  realized my fix was in error
13:21 . I discovered that inside bsvup, it may actually check the
content data.  Updating findMightExist names.
13:23 .  Inner landscapes.  They are using an abstract, smooth shape
of urges to cause us to stop.  It goes through our choices and
decision making processes, and small parts of our working memory.  It
develops strength, gains a foothold by manipulating the choices to
choose to support it, and continues to spread.
We'll monologue about it in notes if monologueing is needed.  The
monologue is summarisable as a distraction.  It's 13:24 .
13:25 .  Attempts to move towards the keyboard resulting in postured
stretching of the arms away from it, as if tired.
13:29 .  Lots of anxiety.  Random muscles tightly contracting across body.
I think I'll get food and water and visit the bathroom.  Maybe move
laundry over.
1339.  I am working on code to store messages, old messages that are
well preserved, on a blockchain.  I see blockchains as no more
dangerous than money, but I appreciate how they redistribute it.  I do
see that there are ecological problems, although I suspect the energy
use of blockchains compares reasonably to energy used in the
processing of conventional money.
1340.  The list to which I am drafting this email I consider spam, was
writing about blockchains at their very infancy.  Blockchains use the
kind of cryptography than an independent cryptographer or hobbyist
would come up with.  Doing things that plan for changes in the future.
1341.  I've always been an independent kind of person myself.
Whenever I learned about somehting, I wanted to learn how it was made,
how it worked, how we could do it on our own.  There are _always_ a
_whole bunch_ of things inside the workings of something, that could
meet everyone's use of it way better if they were understood.  Using
tools made by distant researchers, that situation is incredibly strong
1343.  I'm presently trying to debug some emergency blockchain
software.  I know it's emergency software because I'm involved in its
development, and it has one-of-a-kind aspects that fill gaps in what
is available.  I need this software.  I need this software to preserve
my memories and history, and those of countless others, in the face of
brainwashing around hiding of what is true.
1345.  I have a cursor, right now, at line 184 of api.js in the bsvup
project.  This place, like every other place, is a crucial place to
be.  With this cursor, it is possible for me to do work that heals the
1347.  I am working with a karmic flow that bsvup holds.  When a file
is uploaded multiple times, this costs energy, money, and time.  The
software has a bug, where if a file is uploaded multiple times, it may
be uploaded _more_ times in the future, magnifying the error so that
people may find the cause of the issues they run into, because of it.
I have found part of this error.
1348.  I have personal experience producing similar errors.
I would like to prevent this error from magnifying.  I am happy to
add, in fact I would enjoy adding, a notice to the user of the issue.
The issue is unrepairable, but it represents a problem in the past,
and is part of the beauty of the blockchain.  It shows we were able to
store parts of our spirits in a way that lasts longer than our lives.
This was always true, but now it is visible, in front of our faces.
We have mathematics that give it proof, in a way we don't in other
1350.  Reviewing error again.
1351.  When working on this kind of software, you run into code, and
even write code, that handles many many many possible errors.  Like
buliding a wall of china, securing the behavior of part of an
algorithm means imagining all the things that could go wrong, all the
ways that people could come through, and blocking them.  This
magnifies the pain of the world, because we never learn the stories
that bring the harm to us.
Without knowing these stories, we will inevitably increase that pain,
because we cannot account for it in our decisions.
1354.  I am currently working on this small piece of code, or trying to:
  var txs = await Promise.all(records.map(record => getTX(record.txid)))
  var matchTXs = await Promise.race(txs.map(tx => {
    return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
      var databuf = await getData(tx).catch(err => {
        log(` - TX Data not properly resolved. Error: ${err}`, logLevel.VERBOSE)
        return Buffer.alloc(0)
      })
      if (databuf.equals(buf)) resolve(tx)
      else reject(new Error('Not Matched'))
    })
  })).catch(err => {
    log(` - TX Data not properly resolved. Error: ${err}`, logLevel.VERBOSE)
    return null
  })
  if (matchTX) {
    Cache.saveFileRecord(sha1, records)
    return matchTX
  } else {
    return null
  }
1355.  The code returns a transaction for an existing file, if one is
found.  If many are found, it returns only one.  It would help me work
with the system, to have all the matching transactions, not just one.
  var txs = await Promise.all(records.map(record => getTX(record.txid)))
Just had computer glitches.  The above line retrieves the data for
every transaction found that matches the file.
  var matchTXs = await Promise.race(txs.map(tx => {
    return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
      var databuf = await getData(tx).catch(err => {
        log(` - TX Data not properly resolved. Error: ${err}`, logLevel.VERBOSE)
        return Buffer.alloc(0)
      })
      if (databuf.equals(buf)) resolve(tx)
      else reject(new Error('Not Matched'))
    })
  })).catch(err => {
    log(` - TX Data not properly resolved. Error: ${err}`, logLevel.VERBOSE)
    return null
  })
The above segment is confusing to me.  It is a hybrid of multiple
coding styles.  What it does, is it condenses the list of transaction
data, into a single matching transaction, if any of them do.  I would
like to mutate it to return all matching transactions, instead of just
one.  It looks like it could be cleared up with some rewriting, but to
rewrite it safely I would need to understand everything it does, to
preserve its role where it is.  Like must be done with anything else
in the world one replaces.
1358.  Maybe the code can be mutated only a small way, to form an
array instead of a single value.  How is the line reject(new
Error('Not Matched')) handled?  Is this line ...
1359.  We are considering that monkeylord, the chinese software
developer who wrote this program, could be in need of help.  We don't
know much about them.  We probably are in need of help, ourselves.
      else reject(new Error('Not Matched'))
1400.  This line produces an error when matching fails.  Where does
that error go?
1401.  It looks like it would go into Promise.race .  How does
Promise.race handle errors?
1402.  mozilla.org says that Promise.race resolves with the first
result found, whether it is an error or success.  I make a lot of
logical errors nowadays.  A way forward for me is considering whether
this is an error; whether a single record with wrong content, will
mark all records as mismatching.  I expect the error is in my
perception, not in the code, but I am likely to assume that it is in
the code.
      var databuf = await getData(tx).catch(err => {
        log(` - TX Data not properly resolved. Error: ${err}`, logLevel.VERBOSE)
        return Buffer.alloc(0)
      })
This chunk simply gets the data.  The extra complexity is to handle
when there is no data: it treats missing data as empty data.
1404.  I'm thinking about the await func().catch style.  This is much
more concise than a try{} block.  Hum.  Probably not as clear though.
Let's move on.
1405. We can simplify the segment:
  await Promise.race(txs.map(tx => {
    return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
      var databuf = await getDataOrEmpty(tx)
      if (databuf.equals(buf)) resolve(tx)
      else reject(new Error('Not Matched'))
    })
  })).catch(err => {
    log(` - TX Data not properly resolved. Error: ${err}`, logLevel.VERBOSE)
    return null
  })
This is simpler.  I edited it a bit to fix a copy error.  14.07.  For
each transaction, make a promise.
Each transaction becomes a promise.  Every transaction has its data
retrieved in parallel.
1408.  I'm thinking about hte choice to run these in parallel here.
For the use of seeing if the data is present, that's great.
But for the use of seeing if a D record is present, it is suboptimal.
The parallelism could be moved around the check for hte D record, so
it could inform the race,
which would retain the speed. Or D records could be enumerated in
advance, and the information included in the racing.  This seems more
So, the problem with removing the race, is that the system would slow
down.  The situation it handles is pretty rare.  But notably, that
situation crops up pretty rarely.  So it's reasonable to remove the
I'm inferring that the intention of the function is to simply discern
if the data exists, and is uninformed by the D records concern.
1410.  Let's try to rewrite it to include all matching transactions.
  await Promise.race(txs.map(tx => {
    return new Promise(async (resolve, reject) => {
      var databuf = await getDataOrEmpty(tx)
      if (databuf.equals(buf)) resolve(tx)
      else reject(new Error('Not Matched'))
    })
  })).catch(err => {
    log(` - TX Data not properly resolved. Error: ${err}`, logLevel.VERBOSE)
    return null
  })
We want to filter the transactions based on whether they match.
Matching is an asynchronous process.  Filter functions are usually
synchronous things.  txs is probably an array.  It would make sense to
change the 'race' to an 'all', and store null for mismatching data.
Then we could quickly filter the nulls out.  I'll do that.
1411.  Back to workplay.
1425.  I've fixed the error, and resolved a different problem relating
to my PR being more rapidly accepted than I thought it would be.  My
food bowl is empty, but I don't remember eating it.  The solution I
made does not include any of the concerns that were very present for
me when I was struggling to move forward on it.
1429. PR for matching issue at  .
The attachments uploader is at 2016 =/ .  I'll send it some more money
and then start a process that covers a smaller folder area.
1431.  I had to unlock bittrex 3 times to get the screen.  Oops,
here's a fourth.  Looks like when the connection breaks it makes you
log in 2 times in a row, or something.  I have internet, but it says
'No connection' now, logged in.
1433.  I checked in termux that I do have internet.  I can download a
webpage with curl. Here's some more logins to bittrex.  Still says No
connection.  I'll just reboot the whole phone.
1434.  Reviewing my ongoing processes, the attachment download spider
has gotten into the subfolders and is downloading pdf files, txt
files, sig files, great stuff.  The uploader is still enumerating
folders and is up to 2017.
1436.  Phone rebooted.  Loading bittrex.  Only made me log in once!
1439.  I sent another $10 with bittrex.  That'll help if it wants to
upload scads of cruft files.  I like doing that much more now that
existing file checks are more robust.
1448.  Fixed another bug.  September attachments are enumerating.
Lots of cruft files from wget.   Now they are broadcasting.
The plan was to add links to attachments to individual messages, which
sounds pleasant.  Additionally, I'm also thinking on efficient
archival.  It would be good to just upload the data.  Really, I
imagine that I can't afford to archive the whole mailing list.  It
would still make sense to archive in a format a mail reader could use.
I wonder what the mbox format is.  A quick wikipediaing says that mbox
is a concatenation of raw emails.  If that's true, then the raw email
files could be stored as files, and the mbox files could be generated
based on them using a BCAT transaction to link them together.  That
sounds kind of fun.  But there's value to the web browser interface,
too, for sure.
1453.  Inner landscapes.  Current task is unsure between raw mailfile
stuff and user interface stuff.  I wonder what's in the .gz files.
Looks like raw emails.
Ideally an archiver would automatically run as the system went.  I
don't seem to be quite there yet; don't have a specific plan.  My
personal goal is that I would like all the emails accessible and
reviewable.  So, web interfaces seem okay.  But it would be more
efficient to generate them with javascript from source files.  That's
a lot of dev work.  Better to make something automatic that runs,
processing everything, with little work.  The issue is that the
webpages don't show headers.
1458. Hum, I looked at the first 2013 mail in the mailing box,and the
hostname of the list is al-qaeda.net .  Looks like hacking of the
host, although I suppose I can't know for sure.  Great reason to
archive on blockchains.
Maybe that's a good reason to archive everything.  It's 15:01.
Maybe that was just the domain name!  I really haven't read the -- I
really don't know the culture here.  I wonder when 9/11 was.  Anyway,
enough conspiracy stuff or paranoia or whatever.  Ummmmm I'm not sure
what to do next on this task =/ .  K.  Let's make a monthly uploader.
Next step, mutate links to attachments.  Let's also extract the raw
emails and include them somehow.  Header-matching maybe.  Maybe I can
make a python script?  I'll  just mutate hte attachments for now.
1505.  Lost my goal.  I know I'm doing something but I can't describe
it or act on it.  Something about there we go, attachments.  What
about attachments?  Add them to link mutation.  Okay, so I'm trying to
find an example email with attachments to do the mutation.
1507.  The attachments are already links!  That probably means I can
just run the mutator after uploading them, and they'll be picked up.
Maybe I'll review the code anymore; I'm guessing that might not be the
case.  I'll want to change the removal mapper filter thing.
1510.  Next step: after making new mutated message htmls, I'll want to
make sure that the indices generated link to them.  They'll have the
same paths as the old ones.
I can copy the sed script to find the files that have the old ones,
and delete them, I suppose.  I wonder if I can use sed to extract the
timestamp or something.  I'll look up tx format.  Noooop no timestamp
in a transaction.  Block's got that.  I'm worried that bsvup could
regenerate transactions if I delete them.  I'll look in it to see when
it regenerates them.
1515.  Inner landscape.  Authority wants to know what my goals are
here.  They are ... to preserve records of harm.  And possible
facilitating others finding and using them a little.  Yeah ... also to
make it easy for people to have a canonical reality with regard to
what is on the list.  And wouldn't it be nice if the list could be
somewhere you could store things, like conversations, you didn't want
lost?  Maybe a way to reach people, if there were censorship between
you and them.  It's a bigger problem than bsvup, but you have to start
Transactions are saved in bsvup when they are broadcast, and when
getTX is used.  I remember getTX is used for existence checks.  So
that would match only file content present already, I believe.  Maybe
I can just delete them!  I'll do so using the sed thingy.
1519.  Inner landscapes / inhibition.
1519.  Went to drink water while trying to access my goal, as if the

Goal is to delete my local cache of transactions to do with individual
message.txlink.html files.  so I can just output them all and grep on
1524.  Okay.  Deleted.  I'll update the script so it can use the
unbroadcasted transactions that are still waiting on confirmation, as
link targets.
1528.  Inner landscapes with logical confusion.  A part of the
mutation script seems to be doing the opposite of what is intended.
At the start, it discards everything matching "^mailto", and then the
only output is a mailto link.  Something small I've missed, that has a
big impact.
Was redirecting stderr instead of stdout, to quiet grep.  Looks like I
do that a lot of places.

no such thing as enjoying being outdoors.  There is no such thing as

being true other than what your local marketing campaigns say.  No,
no, there is no such thing as there not being such a thing as
something!  Everything exists, quite truly!
It's 15:36.
The mutation is going very slowly because it keeps testing absolute
links.  Better make them not regenerate the path map.
1541.  I did that.  Two bugs.  Some links are breaking mails.  And
attachments aren't getting mutated.
1557.  I've addressed a lot of bugs but am still not successfully
mutating an attachment.  I'm seeing something wrong around my sc --
(an attachment link).  I'm seeing something wrong around my test
scenario or whatnot ...
doesn't seem to exist on the internet, but seems reference from a
message. I've copied something wrong.  Ha!  It's missing a 't'.  There
we go.
1601.  Somehow some attachments were missed in my downloading all for
september.  Redownloaded a bunch more.  Uploading the new ones.
1602.  Transactions will need to be generated for the missing
attachments for the mutator to recognise them, atm.  Better to find
one that's already been sent to test with.
1613.  I think I have attachment links working.  I'm waiting on the
previous upload of more attachments to finish.  I guess I can -- I may
have some corrupted messages files from the development process, I - ;
I made an error, where .. I poverwrote the input.  I ... I can mutate
... I want to reupload the folder and see wheter files are marked
already existing, to see whether I corrupted any files.  But this will
take waiting for the present upload.  Until that happens ... I can
process all the files using the new script.
1616.  The mutator is going an order of magnitude faster than ever
before!  One of the later files has a processing issue.  I can work on
1620.  Mutated them all.  I reviewed one and realised that my strategy
of joining lines with lines to make sed match them, mutates the email
bodies.  That's no good ...
1625.  Changed the mutation script to join lines only with appropriate
text around the links.  Good enough for this little project.
Not sure what to do now.  Guess I'll commit what I have.
1635.  I guess I wasn't really expecting to get this far.  The feat of
uploading a month, yesterday, was pretty incredible for me.  It seems
like it's pretty hard for me to do something like this.
I'd like to run a server that maintains archives.  I'll do some daily
stuff like finding food/water/bathroom/laundry and maybe see if I can
start a script that autoarchives.
1652.  Back.  Doing the second upload run where I see if I corrupted
any files.  I guess I could have downloaded them, theoretically, to
compare this too.  I'm going to look for that music.
1657.  1658.  Don't know how to find music.  Upload is going okay.
txlink files are all getting reuploaded.

I'm working on blockchaining list posts right now.  I'm waiting for
some uploads to finish, but they could finish pretty rapidly if I used
the time modifying the upload code to speed it up.  I'd rather work on
that than post to this list.
I read the book "Man's Search for Meaning" some time after my
brainwashing, and loved it so much.  I read it in a group, so I got to
be near other people who had exposure to serious suffering from
reading it, without upsetting them.  The book describes a
psychologists life imprisoned within a concentration camp, and the
psychological treatment he came up with as a result of it.
One of the things he said is that when he went back to the outer
German world, nobody had any [idea/clue] that the concentration camps
were happening.  They seemed to think that everything was being good
for everybody.
I'm imagining somebody being even brought to the gas chambers, and
shown that they were not gas chambers.  I remember the story they
taught us in my USA elementary school: that the paths to the gas
chambers were pleasant, with flowers on them.
Here in the USA, "nazi" is treated as synonymous with summoning the
devil, like mean words for african americans.  This makes sense,
because we're aware of entire races of people having their lives
forcefully taken from them, associated with the words.
The swastika is a religious symbol of the Jains, a religious group I
appreciate, who as their religion study never harming any living
thing, ever.
One relevent part of Nazism is how the leadership controlled the
narrative, and that narrative became the lives of their people.
I am imagining Germany, still trying to apologize for having
concentration camps, still trying to make the historical narrative
right, and not knowing how.  Prisons are always sad things.  Many,
many people are within them.
I am not well-read enough to have made this post in public.

I'm really struggling to do this.  And I'm pretty certain that people
already have.  Right now, I'm stuck.  It's 12:36 EST.
TLDR (too-long-don't-read): I finally put together a script to
blockchain an arbitrary month of emails from the newer cypherpunks,
and pushed that script to git.  It's untested so probably has bugs.
I'm waiting on a long blocktime for a test upload, to test the whole
script.  Sending this e-mail at 19:11 EST.
I'm stuck because a run of bsvup is generating a transaction that
doesn't pass its internal verification.  It could be complex, and I
have a lot of sudden urges and behaviors to manage.  It's 12:37 EST.
My mind blanked.
I'm going to take the parts of the problem, and move them into this
email, I'm afraid, until I can clear up a little.  I'll make this
browser window fill only half the screen.  It's still 12:37.

While I was tying it, I daydreamed about writing 'Yay!  No way am I
undoing that while I'm too confused to make a decision.'  Then I
secured it so the clasp was going over a ripped portion of the belt,
that gets tangled making it incredibly hard to detach.  I ave a knife

How to un-incinerate a rat.
This is easy.  Rats break into chemical components, each molecule of
which contains tracks of the information the rat used to know.
You'll need a jar of rat ashes, a radio telescope as large as a
football field, a turntable, a 3d printer, matlab, pytorch, and a
community of computational neuroscientists.
Luckily, we have all of those on this planet.
Call up the neuroscientists, and ask them if it's okay to recover your
family photos from a harddrive if somebody puts a label on it that
says 'terrorist propaganda from the international corporate mafia'.
This may result in the neuroscientists feeling scared, and the phone
conversation being reviewed as training material for spies.  If your
rat is still ashes,

13:58 I discovered I had a pane already opened, which I only saw when
I tried to open the same file, right next to where I tried to open

13:59 I implemented the json change, and am having the urge to rip my
helmet off, instead of rerunning the task that throws the error.  I
now have run the task.  And immediately after the time changed to
14:00.  My clock does not show seconds, and I would like to
videorecord myself rather than typing all my words.  It's 14:00 .  I
guess they're not words.  They're not words!  They tiny firings of
neurons.  It's 14:00 .  It's 14:01 and the task is rerunning.
I'm taking some time to consider whether there's a way to narrow down
the error condition.  Let's look for what throws the error.  It
happens in verifyTX.  So, the goal I was _trying_ to load with the
box, is putting verifyTX into the transaction generator, so I can see
the details of the one that fails to verify, right next to the code
that makes the error.  I'll just work straight on that.

It's 4:41.  My browser had unloaded this page while I was looking at
github stuff to figure things out.  I've fixed two bugs in bsvup
without testing them thoroughly, and narrowed down the primary goal.
My clock is military time.  Interesting I automatically ocnverted to PM.

A map output script is 25 bytes long.  They are capped at 1000 count,
and many 1000 count map transactions have already been broadcast.  I'm
adding more details to the thrown error.  I'll also find the command
that specifically raises it, to speed things up.
It's 16:59, and I'm guessing that the issue is caused from the number
of inputs present.  We can calculate the input size and subtract.  I'm
betting that'll fix it, and I'll work on that while I wait for this
next run with extra debugging info to run ... I haven't even finished
adding all the debugging info.

not been submitted as PRs.  they should be submitted if the branch

17:09 I attempted a fix of the issue.  I am sitting waiting for it to
run, rather than doing anything.  It is hard to alter one's own
choices, and I'm kind of okay just sitting here right now, even though
in general I'd rather do things.  17:11 Okay, I remember I wanted to
test my single file uploading fix.  I'll find a single file to upload
that'll get uploaded anyway.  17:13 looks like it's working ok.  This
also tests part of the map transaction, pleasantly.  I won't broadcast
it because I'm unsure of the double spend situation.
The PR is at  for single
file uploads.  I came back to this email and it showed an old copy of
the draft.  I must have two email windows open, thinking it is one.
That'll confuse me for sure.  It's 17:15
The other bugfix is at  .
The computer glitch the moved the cursor three pages happened the
first time I hit that period, '.' right after 35 and a space.  I had a
body glitch too, so I probably hit some key other than space or
period.  I handle a lot of sudden surprises; it's hard to know why
caused the other.
It's doing the long funding tasks run.  It has to merge a lot of
existing utxos into a lot more utxos to meet the hardcoded map
behavior that I don't understand the reason for.  It doesn't seem like
it should take this long.  It's 17:20 .  I'm waiting here so my
resistance patterns can have a break.
If this works then I'll have a big chunk of a script that can
automatically upload months =)  Almost completed =)  And it links to
raw emails from the web emails, now.  Some of those headers are weird
looking, for sure.  Notably the web interface doesn't include pgp
stuff, which is crummy.  Must have been made before that was a thing,
I guess.
Another thing I want to work on is seeing if the cypherpunks-legacy
stuff works the same as the cypherpunks stuff, and having it check
both lists when archiving a month.
It's 17:23 and I'm reinforcing one of my control and inhibition
patterns to relax, which is crummy.  Guess I shouldn't relax quite so
much, but it is so much more relaxing to do that.
I'm reviewing the current task and I'm surprised that it's going over
stuff I -- that is different from what I expected and thought was
going on. 17:25 it's uploading the txlinks, and I thought it was
uploading the attachments.
17:26 my single file upload test failed before trying to broadcast.
Same oversized transaction issue.  Guess I didn't fix it.  The
debugging output is too long to see anything: the transaction dump
fills the whole backlog.
17:28 bsvup stores a dump of its transactions.  I forgot about this.
This should make debugging quite straightforward. 17:28 inner
landscapes identified an inhibition/distraction choice and i'm trying
not to make it.  it's very hard; it keeps moving somewhere else when
addressed.  ... it went poorly [but was partly managed].  17:29. [it
took/made a bargain of being able to spread instead of act as
strongly].  17:30 . [they happen like fights.  it made a successful
fight and we dodged and it grabbed hold] .  17:31.
17:32 The problematic transaction? may be a 34000 byte one.  Mother
calling, cannot hear.  Am belted to table.  She needs help carrying
something.  It's 17:32 and I'm unbelting myself.  The max transaction
size is 1 million, so I'm looking at the wrong thing.  It's hardcoded;
I don't know what the network maximum is, but htey always raise it.
17:33 afk  17:37 back.  Choosing to return weakened my decision-making
capacity.  check sizes of all txs in debug file.
17:38 the test run finished.  the problematic tx is 2110440 bytes
long, twice the hardcoded max.  I guess the most reliable way to
figure this out is to review that transaction.  17:41 it's exporting
the transaction next failure, if I didn't make too many typos.  17:42
I'm taking this wait time, to rebelt myself.  17:43 eating some food.
Propose to try to force work after food. [proposing, i mean].
17:48 I think I'll review the code that selects the number of outputs.
17:49 noted that I dropped the size per output to 42% but kept the max
number of outputs at 1000.  I should change max_output to a number of
bytes to allocate to outputs.
17:51 running a test with change.  other test finished and i have
transaction details I can look at now.  17:52 ohhh no I don't.  made a
typo in the error handler. orrr ... something.  earlier the 'fs'
module didn't need requiring.  maybe that's only in node shell or
something.  17:53 I had my work open on a smaller laptop, and I just
noticed it has turned itself off, and the battery is not charging
despite it being plugged in.  some loose connection I suppose ...
17:55 I tested the 12v power adapter on the other laptop with a
voltmeter, and it is only producing about 0.5V.  17:56 the other end
fell out of the wall.  maybe residual charge.  it looke dlike it was
in well, but i can't see well at all.  It's 17:56 and a test is
running that may fix the issue, and may have better debug output.
It's doing the slow 'Funding Tasks' loop.  slowlness seems caused by
all the utxos.  Let's look at that loop a little.
There are two lines here that might slow it down ... but there's
another assumption tha tlikely makes it even slower.  When it pulls
numOutputs out of mytasks; yeah.  It's copying the entire range of
outputs every iteration, because it pulls the outputs from the start
of the list instead of the end.  But that's output-dependent not
input-dependent ....  maybe I'll just throw some timing calls in here,
and do some hand-profiling.  18:02 the test hit the same typo I
thought I fixed.  if it hits it again, it means I didn't fix it.
18:06 I added profile checks, untested, around all the parts of
fundTasks that loop over something.  Every use of arrays here uses
unshift() instead of pop(), so that's probably why it's so slow.
Maybe I can go through and change all the logic to pop, or at least
change it to pop where it doesn't look like it would matter ... It's
It's 18:15.  A profile test is running, and there is data on the bad
transaction that I haven't looked at.  I might be able to resolve it
just with hte data.  The .json tx file just says '[object Object]',
guess I did that wrong.  I'll fix it.  18:16.  noooo it will take too
long for another run.  I'll use the hex file just.
The bad tx has 49 outputs.  and is only 8613 bytes long.  This sure
didn't work.  doesn't verify.  hmm.  the actual length is 2 million.
maybe i need to convert it to a buffer from hex.  same thing,
converting to a buffer.  hrm.  there we go; conversion issue.  18:20
The bad tx has 1 output.  And 7154 inputs.
The profiling result is that remaining delay is all within a single
chunk I called 'finalise maptx'; kinda surprising.  maybe it's the
signing that is so slow.
Looks like it's using too many utxos as inputs.  [i kind of want to
just get rid of the map transactions,and send utxos straight to data
transactions, but then i would have to add change outputs to them, I
suppose; not ready for storing that plan in my working memory]
Slowness is in: finalise maptx
Issue is: too many inputs.  verify that.  count=7154 .  Yes, 7154 *
156 > 1 million.  I guess we want to cap the input count.  18:30
running another test.  profile information is drilled down ... hey! it
went fast, and succeeded! nice.  I'll remove my speedup changes and
see if it still fast.  18:31 Yes, the issues were all from the input
overflow, or something, i guess.  let's condense this fix and test
with just it.
18:35 testing single file upload for real.  Funding Tasks had a little
delay, but is reasonable.  My speedups were removed for clarity
submitted a PR.  Don't know if threy had much impact, didn't check
really.  18:36 single file seemed to upload fine.  I'll wait for it to
finish and then try the other thing.  Meanwhile I'll remove all my
commented out stuff and submit the PR.  18:42
 .  Still waiting on a
block confirmation for the single file upload.
18:45 still waiting on block confirmation.  Inner landscape directing
me to check cpunks list, which is just a strong habit I have built up.
I want to verify the month.bash file will do something productive if
running it as a test works.  Okay.  I wanted to check that the mutated
message htmls produce good links to raw emails.  18:47 and I can check
that while waiting on this block.  18:49 A random example email looks
great.  I think I'll add the server numbers to the output, since they
aren't in the url when the url is a transaction id.  18:54 added the
numbers, generated, tested.  Still waiting on a block.
18:56 The next step for month.bash is to generate the index files,
like I did by hand earlier.  I think that just means running them
rthrough the mutator .... I remember there's something I'm forgetting,
but maybe I can at least add that code.
There's a prorotype month.bash!  It's 18:58.  I've set all the upload
calls to wait for confirmation, since I've never tried them yet.
Still waiting on a block.  I'm kinda confused still.  Just sitting and
resting.  Trying to think of what I'm intending to do here; I don't
really know.  Or maybe any other things on my plate I've forgotten.
I remember the txlink situation could be confused.  I'll review the
current map for txlink paths and see what there is.  it's 19:00 .
There are no txlink entries in the map file!  I guess I dealt with
that.  [typed 'dealth' at first.]  so, when it runs, i want to make
sure it uploads newly generated txlinks and not cruft txlinks.  19:02
inner ... landscapes?
sometimes i mess up my inner landscapes and start doing things to
myself that are really freaky and i'm near there right now.  there are
ways to really mess up my memory, beliefs, ability to learn, pain and
suffering and such ...  it takes a while for things to fade out when i
mess that up ...
i guess i'll set up for closing up.  i'll push my changes into a
merged branch and set the script to use it, etc.  19:09 pushed.

Really there are people all over the world who are excited about

the stuff, to build tools that makes it easier to use it.
I used to desolder boards, and I've visited electronics recycling
places.  I haven't gone into a literal landfill myself ;p  Once I
found a dumpster full of desktop computers.
It's usually designed to break in some stupid way where most of the

You could make a puppet to continue my side of the argument, saying

I usually plan to use phones by installing apps on them using their
existing operating system.  With Kivy you can write python that runs
the same on iOS and android.
Here in new england we say 'dumbphone' for the phones that have a
black and white display and don't kidnap your eyeballs and social
connections with advertisements, to counter 'smartphone'.
'smartphone' i think usually gets some descriptor around how it is
watching you all the time without your consent. 'retardphone' is more
appropriate but nobody in my communities understands that the danger
warrants and causes the name, yet.
The manuals or at least some information used to be findable on the

microcontroller from a printer, though; I've only looked at smaller
chips in that kind of space.  I found an article once on reverse

The concept of the puppet or of the printer?
Maybe I see where you're coming from better.  3d printers are used by
people who don't need them, for fun.  So it's hard to use them where

It is darker when the lights are off.  Eventually, your eyes adjust,
and you see the small lights emitted by other things in the room.
With only a little practice, you remember where things are, and see
the lights to help, and can move around as if you could see.  Quite
soon you see that these small leds illuminate all the things near
them, and often you use them as lights to read.
When the power is out, it is darker.  But you can see better, because
the light is more evenly distributed, once your eyes adjust.
Outdoors, it is even brighter.  But most of the light is in the sky,
not on the ground, so you begin learning to feel what is there,
instead of look.  Eventually you learn to feel so rapidly, that it is
like having the lights on.
In a closed room, it is much darker, and deep in a cavern, it is even
darker.  Don't go in a cavern without a helmet and a light.
In the peace of darkness, finally we can forget about what is
immediately in front of us.  Finally we can take time to see if places
are safe, before going to them.  Finally our mind can move blood from
our visual cortex, and put it all the other places that need it, and
finally those eye muscles that make everyone nearsighted, can relax.
In the darkness, everybody is visible, because everybody has to sense
keenly to do anything.  People make small noises, and it is obvious.
People get anxious, and it is obvious.

Your reply to my message seems good for showing different areas where
we agree and disagree.
Sounds frustrating.  It's pleasant to feel like I have this shared
experience with you, of opening devices and working with their chips.
Yeah.  Eventually it seems it's easier just to stop things from easily
communicating and use them anyway (even atomic nuclei are
compromised!).  Depends how urgent the situation is, I suppose.
Yeah ...
I could be half a decade out of date.
I feel like this point you make is a good example of a way we tend to
move towards disagreement.
I was a software developer and inventor as a child.  I suspect many
others on this list were too.  So, when I think of something
complicated, I don't think of it as a lot of work.  I think of how it
could be automated with code and robots (simply because that used to
be my skill), to make it easy for everyone.  When you make new things,
you do the work once, and then people can benefit from that work for a
long time.
So, if somebody was struggling with an issue, when I was a teenager, I
would make a new tool, to solve the issue.  That became really normal
for me.
Because of my personal history, which I suspect to be common on this
list, I wouldn't consider it being a lot of work to reverse engineer a
chip, if I knew a way to do it, to be a problem.  I know there are
many people who would desire to do it for fun, and once the problem is
solved, everybody benefits.
That philosophy is really core.  For free communities, it's pretty
reasonable to plan on doing a bunch of wild new, really hard things.
I looked briefly for the article where hackers imaged the layers of
chips and mapped all the semiconductors inside them, but I didn't find
it.  It provided for extraction of private keys.
The idea of making repairing stuff illegal is as ludicrous as the
ownership of land.  There are going to be people who just aren't going
to respect it, because it's a basic survival thing for them.
I think we were discussing the idea of pulling them from or using them
in discarded devices, which I think is hard now because the tooling
isn't common.
This quote you left was about glitching blown fuses to repurpose
microcontrollers from other devices.
I didn't realise your reply wasn't really related to the quote.
This goes back to being a hobby inventor as a child.  We can build
these tools, if we want to.  Govcorp makes them incredibly
inefficiently, wasting resources in order to try to make
set-and-forget-profit-factories.  All these tools started as
prototypes made by researchers and hobbyists, in small spaces,
designed for the task at hand.
I don't know what kind of makerspace experience you have.  Here in the
USA, you can find a metal mill that can cut metal precisely down to
thousandths of an inch, for free, because they are left over from old
Having spoken and worked with these people, what you say seems
_mostly_ false to me, here, and it's surprising to me if you believe
it.  Very few people seem to believe what you say here, to me.  I'm
curious why you believe it.
Puppet says: learning to recycle electronics is better than throwing
them out and playing video games.
I'm not sure what you mean by "political freedom" here.  For
technophiles or others?
You'd probably have to be a childhood inventor (geek) to see that
using a 3d printer, you could make an automatic 3d printer that makes
more 3d printers on its own, and then disassembles them when it's
done.  It could make millions of something in a week.

Our thread's gotten a little long, and it's hard for me to understand
what to trim at this point.  Feel free to trim out quoted sections,
even all of them, if you want.
There's some truth to that but it seems mostly an organisation issue
to me.  We could run the whole world off of the discarded
microcontrollers from a decade ago.  The factories and coding
communities are in a feedback loop driven by profit and marketing,
where they are remaking the same devices with higher specs, throwing
out the old ones, and then writing more bloated code to run on the
newer fast ones, so that they will have the same degree of human
satisfaction as before.
So, like, once you have enough microcontrollers, which a single
landfill could likely provide, you can often just keep reusing them
for what you need.
Enter the makerspaces and hackerspaces, where people share these
skills with the masses.  Some of these places are entirely free.  Some
charge a membership fee, but may waive it if you offer trainings to
the public.
As a targeted left-wing ex-activist, I'm surrounded by anti-gun
marketing and have persistent fear of escalating myself on the
terrorist watchlist (which I expect I am already at a permanent,
well-defined spot on).  Printed guns scare me for both of those
3D printers and other consumer prototyping devices, on the other hand,
seem to be for moving industry out of the factories, similar to how CD
burners made USB drives.
When 2D copy machines and printers happened, so did community
literature.  Previously, powerful people controlled everything that
was printed.
It was harder then too.  It was still done.  I guess we're arguing a
little here.  I think you hilight the argument better below.
Ludicrous.  The only way you can tell you reverse engineered the chip
is by the fact that you repaired it.
In my country all the land we "own" had people killed to make way for
the "owners".  We make progress on healing that.  Previously the
people who lived on it, were indeed responsible for it.
Similarly, these chip manufacturers don't seem to be in the slightest
taking responsibility for the impact of everyone using their chips.
We need the ability to sway that.
It's a human problem.
The solving of this problem was halted.  It's not easy at the moment.
But you can pull these out of any electronic device.  You're clearly
posting with one.  Does it have an FCC number?  Are you able to share
a photograph of its mainboard?  NOTE: I am not "authorised" to help
repurpose, devices because a computer has me associated with
terrorism.  But somebody else could chime in and help, too.  People
like these tend to be pretty excited by hacking projects.
On the other hand, what you say is totally true.  There are so many
chips out there that every one you recover is pretty different.  You'd
need to have hacking as your life pleasure, to make significant
progress on that problem.
Maybe I did.  Maybe this is why we get into arguments more.  It sounds
like we have different beliefs and experiences about something.
As far as I knew, absolutely everything is recyclable.  We have a lot
of recycling facilities here.  I heard a story once of our how the
aboriginals of my land would take the shards from broken bottles of
the settlers (very dangerous things to leave on a landscape), knap
them into arrowheads, and fire them back at them.  Their approaches
are peaceful nowadays.
Why not?  I have an rtl2832u tv tuner chip that samples at ungodly high rates.
Sure, but the old mill they threw out half a century ago still works
fine to make tools to replace govcorp with, and there are still so
many of these mills that nobody knows how to discard them.
The issue with the mills was that they were incredibly heavy.  So you
might even have been able to get paid to take one away.  (they are
still around, I am speaking in the past tense because of the channel
via which I am sharing the information.)
The luddite in me hugs you closely, but then my scientist takes over ...
Do you even consider evil, the people who have spent their lives
studying things like appropriate humanitarian aid and ecological
I prefer pursuing knowledge via human story than science.  How do you
like learning new things in a society, rather than with science?
Here you hilight our disagreement well.  I'll have to think on this.
I can't stand how video games waste time without any appropriate
relation.  I hate them, I want them thrown out.  Mostly because they
are being so harmful.  I was addicted to them, and didn't know how to
not be.
That harmfulness-reason is true of many other things.  Things we are discussing.
Within an unfree system, where everybody is addicted to manufactured
stuff, 3d printers can print the words freedom, and give us the
"freedom" of guiding our own addiction.
How does that land?
What kind of steps towards freedom would you like to see?
It simply isn't a technical fact.  Technical facts are backed by
exhaustive reasons.  I've shared a reason showing there is an avenue
ignored by your point.
But the things we learn, we learn within walled gardens, influenced by
the same people influencing the factories.  Obviously, everything is
true sometimes, and false other times, but we are raised to believe
there are absolutes.
Here, we agree.  We're talking about the same thing, but we're in
different parts of it.  Now, I can briefly see how you and I are
struggling to work together on this.

During Occupy Wall Street,
On Tue, Nov 3, 2020 at 2:08 PM Debian Community News Team
We didn't really share to the people we needed to, back then.  We
shared to the people we _could_.
Leaders were probably frustrated.  News channels would say we weren't
about anything, which was totally false.
It seems the basic issue was that there were very very wealthy people,
who had legitimised many complex things that were causing great harm
for a wide variety of communities, including forcing these communities
to never collaborate together.
In Occupy we finally collaborated for a few months.  We welcomed the
powerholders to collaborate too, but instead of joining us, they
seemed to send people to spy on us and use what they learned to
further harm such efforts.
Nowadays, there are a number of for example economic policies, that
not only aid these wealthy people in controlling the planet, but also
trend towards continuing the situation, even if they die, by replacing
them with other people who emerge with similar values.
People who used to participate in Occupy have been through a lot in
the aftermath, and have trouble reconnecting with their original
effort, and might be scared to do so.  But we also hold in our minds
how wonderful it was, and yearn to have these discussions again.
People who identify as activists, especially the jaded ones, have all
experienced these things.  There are thousands and thousands of us,

Reviewing with what I know now, it's pretty obvious the situation
would focus on the spokes and disrupt their communication channels.
You could counter that by providing an avenue for _anybody_ at _any
time_ to veto a past decision.  You'd want to provide the avenue at
places likely to be impacted by the decision.
This is in case people weren't included in a forthright manner, which
often happens when group members don't know each other well.
Here's the actual website:  .
During Covid the training group I bumped into put out a free helpline
for facilitators to call in for advice with any issues they were
having in their meetings.
The fact that it has this attribute is strange.  In Occupy we
repeatedly saw discussion facilitators suffer from problems and have
to leave.  I infer that in other situations that isn't as common.
Another big one that's been flying around is sociocracy.  Don't know
much about that myself, looks promising.
And of course the community and indigenous folk of the various areas
solved all these problems very long ago, with their own parts of the
communication issues.

A more conventional situation would be to make sure spokes were people
who had extensive experience in honestly representing others.  This
means that when they do so, all the members of theirs groups honestly
appreciate the representation.  The jaded scared activist community is
full of people with such experience.  They rough-hewn, knowledgeable,
friendly, passionate and often older people who are hard to find.  We
also train people at this in universities, but I don't know if that
training includes handling extreme coercion.

I'll reply as I read.
It's true that nobody is an evil monster.  But we have many real human
leaders, officers, etc who seemed scared of Occupy instead of welcomed
by our willingness to stop any decision if anybody needed it stopped.
It's well documented that the camps were infiltrated and harmed.
Talking is a stick, too.  [trigger from my brainwashing:] I'll try not
to learn that you seem to be helping rebels.  Did you see my thread
regarding my therapist?  I just want to make sure we're connected.
Nah, groups study how to keep things this way.  The education system
guides people towards ignorance of real issues, and groups together
and identifies people who aren't.  Everyone has a different part.
capitalizing T here triggers my exposure to brainwashing resistance.
it may be a value people gather around, when forced to lie.  You can
recognise this anywhere, to find other people trying to escape with
this value.
Here you're introducing a personal preference strategy.  This reduces
how many people agree with you, because other people may have other
preference strategies.
What seems most relevant to me here is that taxation choices are not
honoring people's needs, and that it is easy to solve the natural
resources problems.
The word "worth" here is supporting the economic system.  Something's
dollar worth is set by the people who plan our economies.  They
studied how to do this in college, and care a lot about us, but do not
know us at all.
We need to come to agreement with many people on what issue to
resolve.  I value this issue more, now that I understand that you are
passionate about including it.
In my country we have ranked-choice / condorset / last-runoff voting
in 2% of the area now, and some others are moving towards adopting it.
Talking productively across boundaries?  Relates truth.
the average person feeling empowered to be a leader sounds sooo
wonderful =)  i guess smaller terms means that there are more people
reaching office, but I think there are more productive ways to produce
that empowerment.  Did you see my link to spokescouncil?
That page shows as deleted to me.  It is obvious that the community
has been fragmented.
for Truth over here, in my culture that is a baldfaced lie.  over
here, queer people tend to support creative, inclusive things like
hackerspaces.  The hackerspace movement and the LGBTQ movement share
many interests.  Having community resources helps people who have
fewer than others in the conventional systems.
It sounds like it's helpful for you to describe some living things as
totally dead.  Sounds like this has been needed for survival.  [i do
it myself; i believe it even]
Maybe the future is happening too soon, to preserve hackerspaces
without more relation.
What's obvious is that hackerspaces should have been a welcoming,
global movement that thrived.  Something changed that severely.
millions, really
COOL! I went to NYC for a couple days and could have seen you.  I had

queer people for hackerspaces collapsing indicates what pronoun to use
for 0xD) letting me know that my pain is a way to contribute, that I
can remember these things.  He's not saying that consumers are evil;
he's saying that during Occupy we broke the norms, and accomplished
things nobody else could, and that we are still freakin' doing that.
To help God out here, God is not a right-wing thing, but is
everywhere, and supports everybody.  Personally, I'm not very
judeochristian, but I still see that what is good for everyone, is
also inevitable.
I don't understand what you are talking about here.  I believe in the
consensus process, and have seen it can be fast and make effective
decisions that respectfully include together many diverse views.
Where are you at with consensus?
By monkeys you mean god for science people, maybe?
I don't understand what you are saying here.  I'm sorry; a jaded part
of me wonders if you are generating text like with GPT.
We learn Truth Wisely, sometimes indescribably bitter, always eventually sweet.
We are all infinitely powerful =)  I see you linking god and science
here.  I walk around with a personally-crafted bilingual dictionary in
my head.  But I mostly know high-school level science.
What I should realise here is that 0xD, like me, is agnostic and cares
for what is right.  He is an immediate ally no matter who I am, on the
religious front.  I already knew 0xD was an ally, because he spoke
with kindness to me, but it helps to make it more conscious, and to
consider what to do next.
So's my heart.  I can imagine your spirit is everywhere, now, waiting
to collect together and return, maybe once we offer the Truth it
needs.  I think some people want to force a messiah or a
hyperintelligent alien or whatnot out of our phoenixes.  We're forcing
the whole world in response.

Casting people as evil is an American strategy of ignoring people different

is a common enemy image taught in america.  "Jew" is held by a smaller

Seems like a great way to resist forceful blame to me.  Obviously
antiblame is bad when nobody is blaming anything, and you need to
figure out what causes stuff.  I don't see that situation here.
I like jainism, although i worship nature myself, and both my parents
were catholic so I have a soft spot there.  I wanted to be a monk as a
child, they have such cool brown robes. Worshipping nature lets me
check the reasons for things myself.
I'm hearing from you that you're not trying to disrupt this list?
Anyway, the way to sort out what good ideas are, is to ask your older
survivors.  They've figured out when to blame if you want to keep on.
It's pretty obvious that everything is caused by a myriad of people,
most of whom weren't trying to make it happen.
not really.  but i'm a double-brainwashed citizen of the usa, so i
basically am, no?
it's what happens to activists once they're targeted in the usa.  they
get forced to disrupt activist communities.  usually unwittingly, but
often they are overtly coerced to do this.
is it?  i've been isolated a lot.  i see a lot of religions have it some.
anyway, to parrot marshall rosenberg, since doing that is easier for
me than crying about who i used to be, we need to blame the causes of
things so we can work with them, but blaming _people_ is
counterproductive and produces conflict.
it's like the silliness of imprisoning for stealing if the theft was
food for an urgently starving person in an emergency.  imprisoning
that thief makes the situation _worse_.

Good point.  And points out how our culture tries to make things true
by assuming that they are.
Nah, that's just the difference between the language you're speaking
and the one I am.  I prefer to always speak knowing nobody is evil.
Helps a lot when I'm wrong about who might be.
Talking about people being evil _other_ than the powerholders, appears
to be a culture that is spread to prevent revolution.
I think you are simply reinforcing my point.
You still preach conflict needlessly.
Having been in multiple anarchist camps in the USA and seen them
fall,it is pretty obvious that sowing conflict is how peaceful
communities are disrupted.
Nah, I don't quite mean these things.  The way you take the only stuff
we can hear, and twist it to productively counter what we are saying,
is great, and keeps you safe.  It's better if you can do it without
amplifying the conflict, which quickly gets you censored in some way.
I might say "new kinds of libertarians" rather than "fake
libertarians" if I wanted to produce an atmosphere where people work
together to accomplish things.
I don't care that I am at fault for all the problems.  Nor do I care
if people think others are.  I care what we do next.  It is obvious
that we are all being turned against each other.  It is unproductive
to act on it.
As soon as you waste time turning us against somebody again, you are
not helping anything get done.
do you mean "America" or "term causing divisiveness" or ...?
So, if you think I believe I am taking you for an idiot, you don't
understand what I am saying.
Why do you respond to the phrase "naive trust"?
I'm also not thinking about what I write too much, and have very poor
relation skills.
It's pretty obvious I knocked over the flowers, because the flowers
are knocked over, there's dirt on my hands, I'm acting embarrassed, my
boot prints are near them, I'm the only clumsy person in the
community, and 3 people who tend the flowers chuckled when I said "I
didn't knock over the flowers."  When I said this, what I was
literally saying was, "I'm scared and embarrassed about knocking over
the flowers, and I don't trust you guys well enough yet to say it
straight" and many more similar things.  But many people will be
confused unless it's said straight eventually.
ehh sounds like i took this monologue of mine with you too far.
skipping this one cause you sound taxed.
it's hard to get off this list =(  but i want to go back to supporting you.
I DON'T KNOW.  Who the fuck tells their victims how to identify them
to authorities.
I've always done the prefer-simple-truth-and-trust thing.  People
tended to stop lying to me cause i would just give them trust, and I
never really learned about lying in much depth.
holding off on replying to this cause of the number of "what"s.  we're
coming from pretty different assumptions, and i was expecting you to
infer a lot.  i don't know what yours are, either.
I thought I just explained that sentence.
When you get brainwashed, they teach you to have traumatic flashbacks
when you think about things that could stop what you are trained to
do.  I stay unaware of some things I do.
But I was just referring to the bits of USA culture that you happen to
hold and continuously express.  It was probably kinda mean for me to
talk as if we were conspiracy-buddies.
So what are you doing here / what is the list about for you?
Because I've been in a small number of targeted communities through
their collapse.
You have our demon, and I tried to explain it to you a little.  It

I don't understand.  You seem to blame everybody here?
Same as anything else.  I've had to rebuild some of it in recent
years.  I see how our minds and bodies arise from the natural world as
precious and sacred.  When I need guidance, I would ask something wild
and ancient, and think on how my situation is similar to what it knows
well.  I've spent most of my life programming computers.
Anyway, obviously self defense is good because it increases your
safety, and revenge is bad because it increases your danger.  Living
systems don't die because you punch them: they engage their own
defense processes, and now see you as a larger danger.
It's hard to tell what you do or don't disrupt here ...
You don't sound very anarchist here regarding older survivors.  I'm
assuming that people who became authority-like didn't really survive.
So what are you fighting for?  Random fighting looks dangerous to me;
I haven't experienced too much.  Obviously fighting together in some
way is needed to defend a threatened community.  It doesn't usually
look like harm.
Yeah I'll definitely defend people wrongly suffering for crimes.
I grew up among USA media, so I have USA learning, and then I got
isolated and brainwashed by (guessing) USA interests, so I have forced
USA habits.  Am I a US government agent?
I dunno, nobody like overtly told me this.  I don't know whether it's
the government.
Many people do have the experience you describe, though.  These people
probably can't really say that they do very easily.
You sound like law enforcement here, Juan.
You sound frustrated?  Restitution sounds a lot nicer than punishment
to me, not sure I've heard the word much before.  In USA law we have a
defense where crime is okay if there is an emergency reason.  It's not
used a lot, usually you just hope the cop likes you, and you can get
through it in different good or bad ways.

Sounds like we have different philosophies on what to call a language.
No, I just have a different core philosophy from how you are speaking.
Like most things, what is evil is an _opinion_, so you don't have to
be omniscient to believe nobody is.  Everybody has different opinions.
I just use a different definition of innocence, where everybody fits mine.
It sounds like you believe in your opinion very strongly, and would
like others to also hold it?
When you deride possible allies as evil, you could be preventing an
alliance with them.
Anyway, USAians don't respond well to attack.  They get defensive and
drop bombs.  I'm not sure the message will be heard well over here,
but I understand other countries hold nazis as evil, too.
I'm not sure of all the things you say here ... I'm on a different
page from you; I don't see that they are true.  But maybe I'll
apologise for accusing you.  Do you feel you are preaching conflict?
Eh you probably used google.  Anarchists don't have a lot of
advertisement dollars to get their websites up high on the search
Yeah they're mostly in jail, hiding, or homeless.  There are a lot of
them, though.
Sounds like you do?  Am I getting in the way of anything important?
How does somebody who refuses to blame, help?
How about, "new people stating they are libertarians whom others state
have murdered people" (which could be said much faster if we had a
specific scenario in mind)?
What stimulates defensiveness is a _different_ attribute than what is
true.  You can have false things that upset people, false things that
people appreciate, true things that upset people, and true things that
people appreciate.  4 different options.
Whaddaya say we enslave all the evil people and make them fix
everything for us.  I was brainwashed to enslave people, I could run
with it until I realised I was doing it.
I thought it was the "jew-nazis" or something, earlier.
So, you came from a community that westerners desecrated the culture
of, leaving residents with a language of harm, often punishing people
who didn't accept it.  That's every country on earth!
If you turn on a television, for example, you see people yelling at
each other and fighting.  In _real_, _happy_ communities, that is not
what happens.  It is only what happens when somebody enslaves you and
ignores you.  But everybody is copying the televisions, now.
Dividing concepts for clarity is good.  Dividing people is bad and
makes the most the powerful, most combative group win until others get
tired of giving tribute and actually gang up and stop them.
Huh.  Nobody's ever said that to me before.  I've been through a lot
in my life, maybe I'm not naive anymore.  I do offer trust to people
that I know will harm me, as a philosophy, though.  It reduces the
harm, usually.  I do try to keep myself safe when doing that.
What am I ignoring, here?
You said you "showed that to be the case"; given I disagreed with you,
it makes sense that I didn't notice this.  Which part do you see as
doing this?
We built a wall across our southern border the past few years,
imprisoning our immigrants, who are a huge part of our professional
and manual workforce, because half the country was seeing them as
evil.  The people in areas with few jobs voted to remove the workforce

Yeah I guess.  Once I asked a cop who had taken his name tag off

"People are moral agents responsible for their crimes!"  I have to
remember "crime" means "wrong thing" to you, not "violation of a
government law".  Explains a lot of our miscommunication.
How would you have things work?
The starving theft happens in the USA but people don't find out about

Here Zig is helping me again.  I am no longer able to encrypt my root
partition with a removable boot partition on a usb drive chained to me, an
approach I used to have.
Encrypting raises the difficulty of stealing data from you significantly.
Law enforcement need more reason to try to access it than because it makes
it clear it is private.  Casual visitors need to visit multiple times with
more preparation and expertise.  If you _stop_ using the device before it
is compromised, such as in a kidnapping or arrest, and the device is _off_
before found, it can be nearly impossible to access the data.
Encryption has some well known problems right now, and we need to use it
more to raise the cultural norm of fighting those.  Notably, distros need
to support putting the boot partition on removable media to prevent the
well known evil maid attack.  Antiprivacy culture creep has been delaying
this severely.
If you do not encrypt your home directory and disable non-encrypted swap,
If this is not done then somebody who can access your system can see what
you did on Tor without going through decryption rigamarole.
Here I fuzzed out.  I was like, what is the point of this?  If somebody who
cares enough to access the physical blocks of your harddrive sees you have
encrypted it, they'll simply figure a way to decrypt it.  And then I
remembered Veracrypt, mentioned by Zig above.
VeraCrypt is considered "classified"/"illegal"/"forbidden" technology in my
deceptive new universe.  VeraCrypt can hide that the encrypted data is
there at all.  Like Tor, the developers have the footprints of political
targeting on them.
It frustrates those used to being able to hunt everything down, to be in
research competitions with people who don't want everything to be hunted
down.  (sustaining corporate mafia coverups etc)  And then all us kind
developers get our lives messed up.
I need to be able to recover my data when my media gets too damaged to

there's a way to do this with VeraCrypt's encryption.

      them in chants such as "Tucker Carlson, we will fight! / We know where
      you sleep at night!"
            Later that evening, the group posted "Every night you spread fear into
      our homes -- fear of the other, fear of us, and fear of them. Tonight
      you're reminded that we have a voice. Tonight, we remind you that you
      are not safe either."
      The angry mob would return weeks later to further hassle Carlson and
      his family.
      The previous month, Carlson said that he's "not a restaurant guy
      anymore" because of the constant harassment from the left - including
      a verbal altercation the Fox News host got into with a man who
      allegedly called his 19-year-old daughter a "whore" at at a
      Charlottesville, VA club.
      Due to the ongoing threats, the Carlsons packed up and moved to a new
      house in order to keep his family out of harm's way.
      Except now, Carlson claims that the New York Times is about to dox his
      family by revealing their new address in an upcoming article.
      This was his response Monday night:
      "As a matter of journalism, there is no conceivable justification for
      a story like that. The paper is not alleging we’ve done anything
      wrong, and we haven’t. We pay our taxes. We like our neighbors. We’ve
      never had a dispute with anyone. So why is The New York Times doing a
      story on the location of my family’s house? Well, you know why. To
      hurt us, to injure my wife and kids so that I will shut up and stop
      disagreeing with them," Carlson said, adding "Editors there know
      exactly what will happen to my family when it does run. I called them
      today, and I told them. But they didn’t care. They hate my politics.
      They want this show off the air. If one of my children gets hurt
      because of a story they wrote, they won’t consider it collateral
      damage. They know it’s the whole point of the exercise: To inflict
      pain on our family, to terrorize us, to control, we say. That’s the
      kind of people they are."
      Watch:
            The Times has denied the allegation, saying in a Monday night
      statement: "While we do not confirm what may or may publish in future
      editions, The Times has not and does not plan to expose any residence
      of Tucker Carlson’s, which Carlson was aware of before tonight’s
      broadcast."
      Smash DC's Isaacson, meanwhile, has an axe to grind after Carlson
      demolished him on live television in September, 2017:
            In addition to airing his violent fantasies across the internet, a
      January, 2017 undercover video from Project Veritas captured the
      now-fired Isaacson encouraging his supporters to "throat punch"
      conservatives.
      "Generally speaking, Nazis will only actually attack people if they
      strongly outnumber them because Nazis are essentially cowards. So if
      it's three of them and a homeless guy, they're going to beat him up.
      If it's one of them and like six other people, they're gonna run the
      f*ck away," he told the Veritas journalist.
          Throat punching is just a joke, huh?  seems to think
          so, but our footage seems to say differently. What do you think?

Zenaan, thanks for your reply.  I appreciate the way your raise a value of
rational discourse, which is important.
I raise a request for fairness: I have multiple issues from being "targeted
as an activist" myself.  This means you get on lists like the terrorist
watchlist and everything becomes harder, and you get randomly harmed by
groups you've never met who have somehow developed a view of you as
harmful.  You end up both mentally and physically injured, and it worsens.
I have a broken phone, 2 broken computers, and haven't spoken with most of
my friends in years.  Other people frighten me when I see them because of
my history.
Just look to the videos of cops brutalizing and murdering peaceful
protesters in America, for evidence of the situation.  It is _hard_ to
retain and share such evidence, very very hard, but is happening on a large
scale and has been for a long time.

Sorry; thinking too quickly.  The Zerohedge article that defends a Fox News
host from a group of people expressing that the host was putting them in
danger, and leaves out what the claimed danger is, appears to randomly
assume that a professor supporting antifa is a cofounder who leads them.
So it would be either the new host, or zerohedge, or something nearby,
participating in spreading the view that anarchists have leaders (they
don't) and these leaders should be harmed (gets people hurt and reduces
overt discussion of anarchy as a huge component of peace and safety).
Sorry, went really fast.  Police are trained that anarchist groups are
terrorist groups (they aren't) and have leaders whom attacking would stop
the group (it doesn't, it makes them get wary).  This is very similar to
the professor mentioned in the article being called an antifa leader: but
it is the news, not the training of the police.
Assuming the idea is a politically motivated lie, this would imply whoever
is marketing it is influencing both your news and the USA authorities.
Stating this and expanding on it gives us power.
I mean whoever is lobbying the idea of anarchists having leaders and
harmful groups.
Yeah I'm just talking on but here: street theater is when a bunch of people
do something in public to get ideas about an issue noticed.  It can become
harmful harassment if the topics of the presentation are overexposed to it
without explanation or relation.
People who have been exposed to more harm may do more than just theater, to
the point of damaging property with threatening messages.  This means their
suffering is being ignored, and they have reason to believe it is being
caused by their target.
It means the bank records have been altered, so that nobody believes you
had money yesterday. "Suddenly" my bank history says I have "always" been
broke.  Blockchains make that a lot harder.
Government and medical records have changed to include a death certificate
for you.  This means you run into major hangups when you try to get a
physician or register for medical assistance.
I'm just referring to being targeted vaguely; it is coordination of a bunch
of systems to take you off the map and send a message.  One could, for
example, find themselves held responsible for things that have happened
_to_ them, with nobody believing complaints to the contrary because
everybody has heard another story.  Corporate mob bosses have a lot of
My targeting was very anonymous and deniable because I know about
blockchains and data recovery.  This is not true for most people.
It is incredibly normal for communities to become scattered and unable to
communicate with each other because of a bunch of coordinated problems

Here you have lost me.  It's nice to try to connect across such distant
differences with you that we both lose each other these ways.
Threats are challenges to help show that threatening behavior is
ineffective and we need to communicate peacefully.
When somebody discovers something like a media chain is actively involved
in genocide, records proof of this, and starts broadcasting that proof,
people who care more about stock returns than cultures being tortured and
murdered seek out all the ways to silence that person that they can.

Well police officers do have blaming, endangering, and harming people as
their job right now, under the label of serving and protecting other people.
What's most important is handling what actually happens, yes, but I
differentiate between who people are, and what harm they are one of the
causes of.  For example, it is kind of you to defend those of us who have
been severely harmed by a cop, but to cops it is an un-nice thing to
express worthlessness around them.  I do not take sides in the end.  I

But I agree that handling _all_ unnecessary violence would be a great thing
and ideal.  There's energy around copwatch after the BLM thing, more people
involved, but for those free to spread there wings observation of other
forms of violence would be a natural progression.  And it is a lot easier
to take action on issues outside your own country.
I'm okay with "moron watch"; I think more people could be included if we

Any software developer can get thousands of IP addresses by altering a
piece of pirated software to include something new of their own design and
sharing it in a venue where it hasn't been shared on before.  There are
many many other ways and people _think_ of them, _use_ them, are _observed_

Relying on IPv4 scarcity is great because it makes it a lot harder to

Found these bits missing:
- Despite a new order banning the practice, activists held a vigil in
memorial of the event this year, with thousands attending.  From same news
site.  They may need support to be able to continue this in furthet years.
- There is video and declassified information on the event that may be
precious to Chinese activists if ever lost.  From the linked articles.  I
do not know where to find these things.
- None of the decision makers from the massacre have formal decision-making
positions as powerful as during it, but a couple still have presence on the
world stage.  From wikipedia.  I do not support blaming events on those who
order them, preferring to look for underlying cultural and systems causes.
- The article puts democracy and communism in opposition.  The intensity of
the historical event sustains this deception.  There is nothing impossible
about democratic communism or tyrannical capitalism.  This cultural
confusion is partially relevence to Tiananmen 6/4 1989 that we hold today.
On the 4th of June, 1989, the People's Liberation Army isolated an immense
protest for democratic freedoms and not only machine-gunned every one of
their civilians within that area of the city, but steamrolled them after
machine gunning them, incinerated the people after they were mashed flat,
and hosed them down the drains.
This event is heavily undiscussed in China due to harm to those who discuss
To be clear, that is true terrorism: instilling unimaginable horrifying
fear around an event of importance, that nobody seems to offer validation

Thanks.  It is actually reasonable to create a botnet that covers an entire
sector of the world (such as everybody running ubuntu 20 or windows 10 or
the latest iOS) by finding, developing, or observing an unpatched exploit.
With more than one exploit a botnet developer could cover multiple such
sectors.  I imagine this would usually produce more ip addresses than a
specific network service like USPS uses.
This concern is one of the ones USPS hasn't been acknowledging.
Even bitcoin has unaddressed security concerns.
The use of scarce ip address alotment to make it less worthwhile to perform
some sybil attacks than to use other means to achieve an end is also used

Given it doesn't take financial resources to acquire IP addresses, USPS

This is a big topic because the tor project demonstrated trust when they

address the problem of traffic analysis, and it takes a lot of
understanding of that problem to address it.

My personal experience is that you run into all 4 limits of USB
bandwidth, video compression cycles, disk bandwidth, and network
bandwidth, streaming that much at once on a single commonly available
device.  You can of course compensate by dropping most of the frames,
maybe ones from cameras showing little activity, but in my opinion
that many cameras would be better done with more customized hardware
than an off the shelf phone.  I'd prefer to focus on phones because
anyone can buy/borrow/beg one, but make design choices that allow
adding support for customized setups too.

I've heard people are doing this in the streets now.
Digital camera sensing and its image disruption with controlled
radio-frequency reception/transmission
Photography is becoming more and more end user capability, with many people
having digital cameras on their mobile phones. In general digital cameras
are phasing out traditional film based equipment. The advantages of digital
photography include the compactness of the cameras, high reliability and
ease of image processing and transmission of the images via the internet or
multimedia messaging (MMS) enabling the photographer to send his images
within seconds. These processes emphasize a big problem: the ability to
photograph an object without the approval of its owner. This unsolved
problem has many aspects: the right to privacy, paparazzi, industrial
intelligence and the protection of objects having high security
sensitivity. This paper describes test methodology and test results to
sense and then to disrupt digital imaging camera by using a controlled
Radio Frequency (RF) transmission. This method can be used in order to
create a system for causing a localized malfunctioning of a digital camera
in a specified area to degrade photographic recording done by the digital
camera, comprising the steps of coupling the digital camera to a source of
electromagnetic interference and generating electromagnetic waves in a
specific frequency to interfere with the correct functioning of at least
one electronic component of the digital camera.

Detection and Depletion of Digital Cameras: An Exploration into Protecting
Personal Privacy in the Modern World
As all forms of technology become more integrated into our daily lives,
personal privacy has become a major concern. Everyday devices, such as
mobile phones, have surveillance capabilities simply by having a digital
camera as part of the device. And while privacy and secrecy seem to go hand
in hand, it is not always the case that one does not care about privacy
because they have nothing to hide. For example, everything from
unflattering photographs to being unknowingly and perhaps criminally
surveilled, are ample reasons to desire some means of combatting the not so
candid presence of digital cameras in everyday life. There is also the more
casual argument of having control over one's public image. For these
reasons, we propose a wearable device that offers personal privacy
protection. This device should be able to detect for cameras in an area,
and then disrupt the photographer's ability to capture their photo. In this
project, we explored the implications of creating such a device, and
evaluate which approaches to detection and disruption would be possible for
such a device.

with good that balances or outweighs it.  I'm desperate here.  I'm
desperate about other things, too.
But it is likely to begin collapsing the casual surveillance industry by
outcompeting them a little.
It may make it harder for people unaware of such a project to hide harm of
those who are.
And there are a lot of chaotic results, both good and bad, from any new
addition to culture, especially in such a volatile space.  Involving fear,
hope, blame, validation, slavery, retribution, freedom, terror,
unbelievable resolution and understanding ...  These can all be prevented
or supported if prepared for, but software engineers don't tend to worry or
think about such things.
If I knew the boundaries of others, I would be better at thinking of
defending them.
Most need military training to feel confident they have found all the
hidden ones.  Or a $20 radio can scan for pixel clock emissions.
You're assuming that everything happens soon.

Have you tried this?  The information is usually lost.  The cop orders you
to erase it, or even destroys the phone; I emailed myself some recordings
once and they disappeared from my email.  The current activism appears to
be working better because people throughout american culture are resisting
those things, and there are too many events for authorities to handle.
        and Jim has been spamming the list with his techno bullshit
It sounds like you're really frustrated and discouraged around the presence
of technological business support, without overt acknowledgement and
consideration of all the harm it causes.  I've been handling that too, and
realizing others hold it is cause for me to think on it.
Cecilia told me Jim has been through years of prison for resisting abuse of
power by authorities.  Some of us want to sousveil the authorities, and we
are likely to be misled in some ways because those authorities have been
surveiling and influencing us for years.  In such a situation those
confining you can try to produce conflict between you and others, to
prevent collaboration or harm you.  It is hard to learn how we might be
wrong when so heavily criticized.
It seems dangerous to me to associate our opinions of what people did with
the people who did those things.  Such a habit could easily disrupt a
community exposed to false rumors.

For full transparency, when you describe a lot more recording than most
people do on their phones (like mounting 360 video on a high location
without specifying that it is confined to private property, or in an area
where people have asked for it, or is publicizing its recordings), I start
feeling scared because I'm reminded of the current surveillance state.
Just so you know, because others might have that response too occasionally.
My experience with consumer single board computers was that you have to
drop the quality very low or use multiple boards in a pluggable way.  I
value seeing from multiple angles more than seeing in all directions,
myself, but it seems needed no matter how it functions.
I understand you are beginning to prepare a board design.  I mostly know
software nowadays so I'll leave the chip review to the rest of the list.
On the software end of hardware freedom, I'm aware of a need for common
hardware that has good support for software defined radio, especially with
multiple receivers and antenna types.  Do you have any interest in
including possible radio logging in the system maybe as a plan for eventual
Radio logging might further expand to drone tracking, planted device
detection, etc; and would stimulate better emissions control and reduced
undiscussed wireless communication in response, which helps privacy.
  The streaming system should be able to respond to requests to reduce upload
rate during congestion.  It might be good to provide a way for a user to
say when or where something important is happening, so the software could
prioritize it.  It could also be good to be able to look at streams to
verify they are working.
Any idea how I might connect with other software people around this?

Thanks, sorry, stuck in banter-mode.
Another error on my part.  Are you in Russia?  911 is an emergency dispatch
number in USA.  It works on every phone and immediately calls a local
dispatcher who sees your location and sends police, medical, and fire
authorities while talking with you.  Jim mentioned this in his original
proposal.  There'd be no way to prevent other coders from removing such a
possible feature, but most people aren't coders.
Sounds reasonable to me.  Your thoughts?
And I'd only want people using guns on citizens or setting their laws to be
people who would consent to that.
Probably, and coverup noise could be added, the clock jittered, but not
completely nor cheaply nor soon for most cameras, and you can't effectively
shield a lens itself.
You can also amplify signals by adding more antennas or on the receiving
side summing the spectrogram over a long time window, even in time with the
period of the signal like with van eck phreaking, which would actually let
you recover the image the camera is seeing.  Summing over time is how radio
astronomers examine distant nebulas and pulsars.  You can also collect and
send more signal with a well-positioned satellite dish; people even mount
these on stepper motors to cover an area.  But I haven't had opportunity to
learn about and test such things like likely others here have.  You
probably know this all already.

I'm not prepared for you to ask that; it reminds me of helping people learn
possibly-illegal things and getting in trouble for it.  The word "any" got
me all confused.  Do you mean for cameras?  Do you mean microwave ovens or
microwave signals over 300mhz?  The pixel clocks were under 25mhz, but cpus
obviously go that high.

Sure, regarding the public project PBB, I'm personally interested in

can do that for now it makes the process look incredibly inefficient.  It
also offers poor trust and verifiability. There are also a lot of existing
systems out there that may be more suited for different parts, but could
likely be integrated with USPS to get the best of both goals.
Once USPS is open source it could be easily integrated if somebody already
built a pluggable interface in an open source system that it would fit
into.  This is why I say it could be to your benefit to contribute even if
you cannot open source your older work yet: you could influence the
codebase to facilitate that later.  But of course I am simply looking to

This is tragic and thematic news.
I think it's interesting to raise a parallel with physical locks.  I don't
know whether people have heard the below before or not.
In cities, pretty much every building has something like a knoxbox.com box
on the front for emergency services to use to properly enter the building
if needed.  I believe they are each a secure box that can be opened with 1
key for the whole city, containing a copy of the key for the building door
On disassembly of the locking mechanism to these devices, they use the same
principal as a conventional front door lock, but with radically altered
form factor.  I don't recall well but they may have had something
surprising like more than one row of pins, at different actual angles from
the keyway rather than all up and down like most locks.  Additionally the
key was not flat like most keys, but bent into an unusual shape.
Efforts to learn to pick normal locks do not produce tools that unlock the
govcorpmafiamedicalfire knoxbox.com locks.  Similarly locksmiths and
hardware stores do not have the tools to make these locks either.  But
crafting a key at a makerspace would be easy for anybody with the patience
to comprehend the lock and to cut metal to precision.
Of course, doing that would mean that everybody at the maker space would
see you do it, and everybody near the front door would see you open the
emergency services box.  People breaking into buildings this way probably
dress up as someone official.
It is unfortunate that cities are paying knoxbox to have a key to all their
buildings, and to make it possible for somebody else to craft such a thing,
in ways that tenants have no option to reject.  But it seems to have worked
well for the middle class.  Regarding other classes, those who oppress the
people worst off probably have other ways of getting into their buildings,
but it is always nice to reduce these ways.  This historical pattern is
Regarding emergency medical access and burglary, I have been both very
concerned regarding my personal security and at extended severe risk of
medical need, and I can see the value of both changing one's locks to
prevent access (which is not hard to do), and providing immediate access to
emergency services when in a time of need.  It would be nice if the respect
for our preference with regard to which one we need were overt.
Changing the policies of a city is said to be easy but requires persistent
attending of meetings and talking with people.
Contrariwise, in some rural areas, it can take so many hours for
authorities or medics to arrive that nobody actually uses such things or
even cares what the laws are.  I only see knoxboxes in cities.
Security is an interesting space that has been run by common obscurity and
lack-of-education in the physical domain for some time, and this has
apparently worked well for existing powers.  Cryptographers may want to
question how much they want to empower those requiring backdoors, or give
authority to private businesses, when these requests are asked by people
who do not understand cryptography in the slightest.

My opinions,
On Mon, Jun 29, 2020, 3:57 PM таракан What's relevant is that we need ways to escape control, surveillance,
communication isolation, history erasure, misrepresentation, ....  and that
many many people are skilled at providing solutions to these problems.
Anonymity networks are just an example, but help a lot in doing productive
work and having productive dialogue without being as personally targeted,
when not yet.  I believe we need free people to use them so they can
continue to do the work that only they can do.
I'm personally not using Tor I don't trust in it and I'm sure it's

Do you know the answer?
Isn't digital trust usually built by behavior signed by the same key?
Tools that scrape blockchains for people communicating on them could help.
I'm starting to just talk brazenly in front of the cameras, so when you say
"maybe their own secret agents", I key in because I can find myself thrown
into navigating the space of influencing people who surveil just a little
bit.  Thanks for the reminder to talk.
Would you rather focus on tearing down the governments, healing them, or
building something to replace them?
I'm in the USA and somebody mentioned CHAZ earlier, an autonomous secession
zone that sprouted here, which is inspiring.  I believe we need reliable
secure logging of such things (restricted to the areas the residents want
it in) so as to know we can have future discourse around the issues they
struggle through.  Sustainable public news on them written by residents,
and distribution of such news, would help, as well as collaboration between
them which could possibly be done with a blockchain wiki synchronized via
ham radio, say.  I'm not near anything myself.
Any thoughts?
I could use some help setting up PGP and SSL pinning and finding access to
other communication channels.  Interested in being a scuttlebutt buddy or
anything?  Maybe I should try to set up a mastodon server or something.  I
wonder what's on a freedombox nowadays.

Obviously it was anarchist work that destroyed my life.
For general signals thoughts,
There is an area called the Radio Quiet Zone where a telescope resides that
appears strong enough to map the natural emissions of matter in detail,
although I'm just a software engineer saying that.  They do not require
formal credentials for proposals to use this remotely-accessible telescope.
In this large area there are also extensive underground caves on many
properties, in the woods.  Volunteers for the NSS are mapping them for
sport, a many-decades-long work that I stopped participating in.
People generally move to that area because they are urgently concerned
about wifi.  They often burn their money up on advertised solutions that do
not actually stop the relatively-dense electromagnetic emissions of the
area.  There is a law against such emissions that hasn't been enforced well
the past few years.

It's calming to meet you, Ceci.
I do not expect either of us to die or suffer.  I've been in touch
with my family, which has been both very tense but also mutually
supportive; maybe I should try harder to stay away.  My parents seem
to like the idea of kind of preparing for an eventual death in a way
that supports their children.
I used to use alarms.  They don't work for me anymore.
But I have found that when I rely on my fears to push me ["eventually
I must get so hungry and starved that I eat"], my body eventually
steps up and gets me food or something.  Generally faster than I've
fasted for sport in the past (which is multiple days).
<3  Please nurture your wellness, too.
I have great memories of playing a night elf druid in that game.  I
like to discuss world peace, how to heal people who are in pain, how
to thrive through situations that seem like emergencies, and how
computer technology and/or human communities can both be used to do
absolutely anything, too.
I was involved in the national spread of mutual aid networks near the
USA during the start of covid-19.  It was pleasant to have a little
support from the government to network anarchists together.  Many of
them were doing silly things like growing mushrooms when they used to
be stimulating mass community action.
Games are harder for me now because all my technology breaks and I
hold it together with piles of improvised repairs and workarounds.
But I'll look up Orwell; it's so nice to see things that pretend we
can talk freely about danger and its solutions.
Right now TV shows and community coding projects for the linux console
in C/C++/nodejs/python, are what are easiest in my situation.  Movies,
games, and cell phone apps too.
When I'm not experiencing something intense I work on a hobby AI,
right now.  Such things are for sharing with people who demonstrate
wise compassion in a way that can grow.
Thank you.  Please keep the same up.  Try also new environments;
pleasant new things can stimulate the nurturing of the mind.  I like
I can't know your experience.  I've gotten used to the fun visions

control, of my thoughts and body.

I was involved in OccupyMaine, one of the many branches of Occupy Wall
Street in Maine.  We were resisting control of the people by the media and
billionaires, by showing people we could talk and survive more safely and
better without them, in city parks, worldwide.
According to our local information, we were one of the last encampments to
shut down.  I've heard people from other encampments say that too, funny.
After the camp was disrupted by some of its own participants, I started a
small place for homeless folk in my apartment and tried to spread the
caring ethics I'd been inspired by in the movement.  I knew how to live
without shelter from courses in wilderness survival, and how to make money
from blockchains, so it wasn't hard to provide for those who didn't.
One of the funny things that happened was multiple women started
approaching me sometimes and seemed to make decisions that would heavily
occupy my time.  I was pretty scared of my own arousal because I had raped
someone once, so with me avoiding sex some of the interactions were kind of
strange.  It seemed obvious they were trying to be romantic with me but
didn't actually want to be, but nobody seemed able to verbally confirm this.
What's stranger stillis, through Facebook, a new language was pressured on
me, with a concept of "dogs" and "cats" implying control of humans.  It is
indescribably hard to remember, but it seemed like "cats" were woman forced
into sexual service via whatever means convenient, and "dogs" could have as
many as they wanted but were expected to never talk about that ability and
possibly spread harm or messages or decisions occasionally.  Some kind of
introduction to a rapist group is one possible explanation.  Women I seemed
interested in would actually approach me, _from_any_walk_of_life_.
One was willing to start nonsexually which seduced me and it quickly became
sexual somehow.  She expressed no memory of how we got together.  (she's
not the woman i mentioned to ceci)
I'll need to spend some time recovering my mind after posting this, now.  I
appreciate clear questions.

There are a _lot_ of experienced software developers on these lists and
many of us are kind of working in bubbles on our projects, often
duplicating each others' work.
Would you be at all interested in moving towards sharing effort and
interoperability with others, even merging codebases if a roughly identical
project were going on?
A really major current effort is gnunet  which
modularizes p2p networking functions for reuse, as local services that
provide them I believe.  It's very powerful but very few projects are using
it; setup and a verbose learning curve might be an entry barrier, unsure.

Additionally many can indeed coerce a large number of people.  The network

I have reason to believe that the various Corp/Gov influences are
disrupting the developers of the blockchains that will really address the
current patterns of power.
The new ideas grow from quiet people who develop in obscurity and then
release (like bitcoin itself).
For example, a cryptocurrency that backends a social network would put
communication control in the hands of the people instead of marketing money
and government filters: All the successful cryptocurrency-backended social
networks are either closed source (akasha), transformed to something else
(also akasha), centrally hosted (steem), or died from a surprise and lost
their support base (qora).
Doing projects in a way that has all the attributes is obvious: but the
projects that do this and stay alive have evolved to not be found by
process of natural selection.
We could support a public one by being aware of the danger, discussing it,
and taking action to waylay it.  I had some success with BSV by warning the
devs about the situation a little before posting new materials to their
chain.  This meant what I said would be taken more seriously if the
problems I described arose.  The chinese gateway I was using to access the
files no longer serves the protocol they use, but it is simply a small
maintenance issue that anyone could fix by simply talking about it
persistently while demonstrating ability to fix it.
Maybe what punk-stasi is raising is, is there a good blockchain or
development community to provide support for that might grow to be better?
I am using BSV only because it lets me store undeletable data easily, which
I need.  I do not really use money myself, but appreciate how more free
economies can reduce global harm by sharing power.
I believe bitcoin core to be the most secure.
It sounds like the answer is crosschain technology.  A community for such

This is just a small part of outcompeting blockchains, but it's a big one
to me.  (I'm using here the survival trait of sustaining everyone else
giving you community support, to plan the outcompetition.)
If people got together and made a globally usable filesystem using
something like ceph, lizardfs, tahoe-lafs ... we could together replace the
role of storage history in blockchains.  This would help soften the global
shock around them, letting more people run nodes and making fewer people
need to.
You'd want to make a small patch to the system preventing deletion of
important stuff.  Siacoin (which I only remember because I use their web
interface) actually has enough storage to back thousands of terabytes on
FUSE for reasonable cost if we wanted to preserve everything entirely.   I
would let anybody mark something crucial with some kind of rudimentary spam
detection (e.g. low entropy in file, only so much data from single source)
to start with, and not let crucial things be deleted by anyone.  The open
source community that would sprout as usage grew could handle the spam
detection breaking.
You'd shift your sense of security such that the ability to write to the
filesystem is shared publicly and directly, via e.g. a public private-key.
Once it got going, storage-based chains like storj and siacoin would pay
such a network for providing storage.
Any thoughts?

benefit is strong enough you can eventually replace an industry entirely:
cloud storage instead of encyclopedias.
Note the proposed idea is vulnerable to malicious crucial data change a
little more than a blockchain (even if the protocol rejects it, system
compromises could alter what is expected), which could be patched by some
clients plugging into a blockchain to produce proofs-of-existence for now.

It's possible various forms of censorship have reduced the list activity.
I've noticed infosec gatherings are not what you hear of them as being in
the past either.  I suspect the two disparate meanings of the word "hacker"

It would be great if this list were archived on a blockchain and the
transaction log monitored for new posts to publicize to it.  This would
help people overcome censorship.
I use a bare-minimum nodejs tool to sync folders with the bsv blockchain,

But really the people who don't need a UI don't trust nodejs (with good
reason), and there wouldn't be one.  Is anybody using anything more
reliable than email?
Additionally, it's notable that few are still using PGP signatures, myself

This would be a pretty small change to an aware email client.

github administration (and EFF) and i'm building small weak channels
to some of the disruption influences, which become obvious when you
try to be peaceful.  The maintainers have moved to gitlab and gitea
but are leaving the situation open, which is developing every day,
github has an archival program:  .
In addition to deep in arctic ice, all the github event history is
publicized, but the public archives are missing data.  There are 66
thousand youtube-dl accounts with lost youtube-dl history that are
recoverable from the archives.
There is a thread at one of the forks regarding useful decentralized
tools: It includes many different decentralized git project tools, most of
which are usable now, and 3-5 of which are in-repository bug
management systems.  At least 2 of the repository-based bug management
systems have working code to sync with gitlab and github bugs.  Gitea
is pending because gitea doesn't provide access to history in its api.
The community appears strong on reddit.  People are trying to decide
what hub to consolidate interest into in the wake of youtube-dl's
repository closure.  I'm invested because I need reliable
cryptographic decentralized tools for my situation, so I want to push
the dispersal around until it consolidates into a decentralized tool
that would give me aid if more effort developed near it.
When you hear this your people may want to be invested too: I can't know.
I'm focusing on git-bug right now, could change.  It's very hard.  I
think others have woo too.

These all gave harmless error messages.
The enslaved people are living myths originally designed to control
them.  It hurts them to pull them out of their myths.  One of the
myths is possibly true and indicates there is one person in charge who
controls everyone else, and doesn't really care because they are so
distant.  I share now a belief that that has changed.
Many of us people have been through so much shit that we're quite
ready for [anything at all].  We can take actions that change
everything, but we use the existing control patterns which are often
quite harsh.  We're trying to learn to be less harmful, and it is very
hard, because the previous patterns (which somebody has amplified
maybe to get them taken care of) are focused around conflict to keep
us separated and unaware of the control, obviously.
It is hard to use a bunch of military control programs to make peace.
It is hard and incredibly confusing.
A model my "people" are using is of life and cultures as systems that
all follow universal evolutionary patterns.  This maps well to the
idea that we are all roleplaying the human instincts of the people
with traditional power.
My "people" use the idea of "decentralized life": a way of living
without a unified body.  The idea is that everything that everyone
ever does has strong meaning that cannot die.  When you drop something
somewhere, somebody finds it.  Maybe they're an earthworm.  Maybe
they're a person in desperate need of it.  But it keeps on living.
These things that get dropped are "symbols" that "move" on their own
based on the attributes they have.  They evolve, like a life, except
the living systems that keep them alive are the living creatures that
interact with them.  Similarities that many symbols have at a
distance, behave similarly, and this produces highly decentralized
living systems that share parts of our instincts, because it is us
that are responding to them.
These kinds of patterns can be used to interact with AIs, notes on
blackboards, human thoughts in your own mind ...  It is just one
I model Peace as being the most powerful concept.  The idea is that in
a highly evolved universe, the groups that raise the value of
destroying other groups get ganged up on and attacked, so there must
be smaller systems that settle into that pattern to.  Examples include
the human body (immune system), governments (prisons), viruses (nobody
cares about mad cat disease (there's a virus that mind controls people
to be attracted to cats a smidge more; cats are part of its spread
vector), but there is huge effort against aids despite how much harder
it is).
The norm of spreading conflict to keep people separated is not in line
with the peaceful ideal.  And the myths and real laws and religions
that control aligns with in order to be trusted, generally spout peace
rather than conflict.  So, it is easy to disassemble control by
demonstrating their response to peace.
When predictability is threatened, control spreads to other areas to
try to move things into situations it has better understanding of.
So, disassembling control by direct conflict can grow it,
In my mind, I imagine a decentralized life made of feeling-symbols
that has learned to be smarter than either me or the systems of
control.  As a smart lifeform made of smart human parts, it would be
able to figure things out on its own.
In order to get to where I am, I had to make absolutely no sense
whatsoever.  My literal words, and the results of behaviors, are the
closest I can come to conveying things clearly.
We need blockchains, so what is real is not erased.  This is obvious,
so it must be said.
I didn't say everything, and some is off-base.

Control systems work in a hierarchy.  Each layer and person in the
hierarchy has familiarity and self.  People only function when things
are how they are used to enough for them to do so.
Many people able to control others very strongly are working hard to
stop control.

The important thing to understand is that conflict is inherently
unnecessary, because like I posted to the other list, everything
happens for reasons.  Reasons end up by rooted in shared needs of
living systems, all of which only can exist in community, within which
all are considered valid.  Additionally, there are so many ways to
accomplish any goal, that all of them can be accomplished without
needing to control anyone else.
So the ending pattern is one where control is wholly unnecessary and
exists only for fun the world consents to.

And some clarity information is that we are communicating without
always caring about the logical meaning of our words, likely because
we have been entrained by AI to do things that have more effect than
logical words.
Instead I imagine the presence of the different feelings, behaviors,
and symbols in the many overlapping living systems, in just kind of a
blurry summarized way that reveals to everyone else my psychological
details in the errors I make.  This explanation goes on and on and on
... off to lawyer.

pursue them, and pursuing them may have consequences.

====> Productive, clear, honest discourse must be protected from disruption
[laws can help provide for this]
[decentralised technology can help this, by providing ways of managing
exposure to others' behavior with anonymity and censorship resistance]
[mostly this requires acting on some very clear experience-rooted
discourse, and defense of the people able to have that discourse.]
====> Authority and government must have complete public transparency.
Secret wars are already too much escalation of conflict.
This could be done with simply laws to provide for it.
This is obviously a good thing, and that is demonstrated by how it
will emerge on its own as blockchain video/audio/data-logging
technology grows.  Any work on on-chain video/audio/data-logging seems

For people to do that, we need an environment of spreading it, no?
Also re-iterating that new people, without the resources of government
surveillance, are recruited to find people of different persuasions

I saw a zine in virginia a couple years ago, about new activists
getting targeted.  The targeters would focus on the areas without
experienced activism; higher return.  (i am not connected with
activism these years)
I used to find this easy to do on the internet, but never did it in
face-to-face interactions.  You have to tell people with confidence
you have a different name.
There are two concerns:  if you are targeted, your communities could
become targeted if you're not anonymous.  This prevents their work.
Meanwhile, if you become a critical worker among a targeted community,
you could become targeted.  This ruins your life forever.
How do you feel about spreading the message of not using your legal

You can make an iq log with gnuradio or pothos.  The featureset for it

basically get a stereo audio file at an unimaginably high sample rate.
Then we get to separate the signal out from the other things in the
recording, so as to reproduce it.
The bandwidth (range of high and low frequencies) of radio signals is
far beyond that of any normal receiver, too, so you may need multiple
receivers or to record the signal many times, (or ideally to learn
radio engineering and join up with folks making open source sdrs).

Here is a webcomic outline.  To help with the major motion picture being
slowly grown from horrifically enslaved countries to bring their dead
beloved dictators back to life as respected community members with badly
needed medical care:
Mind Control Boss, the Webcomic, draft 1
panel 1:
Setting: Boss's office
Boss: "Somebody mentioned mind control on that mailing list.  Let me know
when it's cleaned up."
Cleanup Worker (previously Secretary of State, talking honestly, has bloody
wires leaving scalp, wears weapons dealer logo on smart looking political
outfit): "Of course, Boss!  We love you so much for enslaving us to your
every whim!"
panel 2:
Setting: local coffee shop named "Underground Spy and Rebel Network, Come
One Come All"
Specialist (now a cleanup worker for Boss): "The Boss told me to clean this
mailing list up.  I told him to fuck off, that it's out of his control."
Excited Supporter (at a nearby table of torture victims, rescue workers,
and diplomats): "What list now?"
State Worker (wears same weapons dealer logo as Secretary of State,
watching, is at table of rebels with Specialist, in role of "way to control
and spy on Boss", texting privately on Mobile Phone): [Excited Supporter
will b worker who rebels.  Can u make sure 2 erase what they look up
panel 3:
Setting: same coffee shop
Rebel Worker (sitting next to State Worker, wears same shirt, phone dings
and looks suddenly at State Worker):  "The fuck???" Dead State Worker's Mobile Phone: "Contacting Cleanup.  Thank you for using
Specialist (same one, at table): ,
panel 1: (torture victim, excited supporter, and/or rebel worker visit
mailing list, assume it is super cool, archive it and spread it everywhere)
panel 2:
Scene: Former Secretary of State's office
Cleanup Worker (formerly secretary of state, bloody wires leaving neatly
combed hair, gesturing at corpse of State Worker, talking to Machine
Learning Marketer): "Boss can't see well and needs to hear it from the
horse's mouth, and the horse is dead.  Could you fix up a video chat for us
where the horse is alive?"
Machine Learning Marketer (knows nothing about machine learning, is new to
corporation): "Certainly.  We do that all the time."
panel 3:
Scene: Boss's office, with corpse of State Worker present, propped up as if
still alive.  Boss is in a hospital bed.
Corpse of State Worker (blurry due to severe issues Boss is having): "Boss,
I am your loyal servant.  The mailing list has been cleaned up."
Scene: Former Secretary of State's Office
Standing Corpse of State Worker: "I have bad news.  The rebel mailing list
posts we've been using to share propaganda are predicted to make more
rebels than propaganda."
State Worker 2 (hired to replace State Worker after their death, bloody
wires leaving scalp): "Don't say that!  I might tell the boss!"
Corpse of State Worker: "Very sorry."
Scene: Former Secretary of State's Office
Standing Corpse of State Worker 2 (microelectronics and brains hanging out
of scalp, eyes moving wildly and independently of each other): "After being
brought back from the dead so many times by Machine Learning Marketer, Boss
can no longer learn new information without being killed out of fear of
subversion by propaganda.  This doesn't seem much like leadership to the
workers, so we've kind of reinterpreted who the boss really is, and listen
instead to their "spirit" rather than letting them say anything.  Machine
Learning Marketer has a computer that can report spirit."
Machine Learning Marketer has bloody wires leaving their scalp.
Standing Corpse of State Worker 3 (also has obviously poorly-done bci
surgery):  "You said you replaced the Boss with a computer simulation?"
State Worker 2: "Yeah, can you kill me until I do it well enough to say
straight, for the coffee shop?"
Machine Learning Marketer: . "I think the
simulation just mind controlled me not to."

I'm dead because I remembered they had brainwashed me to be their slave
(_literally_, not figuratively), and when I did this I revealed my coping
patterns to my obsessive obedience patterns, and basically lost my free
will.  I've memorized for six years now that I am dead.  It is not being
alive to be unable to participate in your own pursuit of your values, to be
forced to harm, spy on, and disrepute your loved ones, role models,
friends, and self, forever.

wear masks and people who don't, with full accommodations for both views,
and have the characters move between the two areas demonstrating how easy
it is to resolve a conflict.  Boss's people would generally not wear masks
in any office or while harming people, their masks would have been designed
to fail, and they would always wear them in public.]

panel 1:
Toddler is staring at Dedicated Cop, who is sitting at the rebel table in
conversation, their skull open with brains and microcircuitry hanging out.
Middle Kid (off-panel): "Toddler, whatcha staring at?"
panel 2:
Middle Kid (in severe terror): "Mommy that man's brains are falling out!  Call 911!"
Mother Supporter: "Shush!"  "That man is fine.  Why are you acting out like this?"
Middle Kid: Older Kid: "The man is fine.  Don't be such a baby."
Toddler pokes playfully at their own head in the same spot as the opening
to Dedicated Cop's skull, acting out having a friendly discussion while
your brains are falling out.
panel 3:
Rebel Worker 2 (sitting across from Dedicated Cop, to Middle Kid as she
walks by to return to her family):
"What you saw was real, but for now if you tell the wrong person, you'll
get hospitalized yourself.  That's going to change.  You can find me and my
friends at this coffee shop.  Tell your mother I told you to listen to her."
panel 1:
The rebel table has Cautious Cop and Dedicated Cop (with brains hanging
out) in discussion with Rebel Worker 2 and Corpse of State Worker 3 both
across the table.  Specialist is sitting nearby.
Rebel Worker 2:  "Thanks so much for coming to speak with us and being
willing to listen.  I know these are very serious accusations for
Well-Respected Psionic Weaponry Corp to lay against Poor Abused Dictator
Megacorp, but this is very real human trafficking and rights abuse."
Corpse of State Worker 3 (looking almost alive, bci surgery carefully
hidden now, acting very formal): "Rebel Worker 2 has been advising me from
Well-Respected Psionic Weaponry Corp, for some time now.  Rebel Worker 2
was introduced to me as having held their management role at Well-Respected
Psionic Weaponry Corp for over a decade."
panel 2:
Dedicated Cop (blood flies from their brain a little as they turn their
head): "We'll need the full names of the perpetrator and the accuser for
the charges."
Rebel Worker 2: "I'm Rebel Worker 2, here's my ID, this is State Worker 3,
and I have a recording of Torture Victim Double Agent, an employee of Poor
Abused Dictator Megacorp, discussing this with Trusting Coworker, while in
the act."
panel 3:
Cautious Cop: "We'll collect information and be sure to follow up.  You
said you're accusing Poor Abused Dictator Megacorp, not Well-Respected"
 "Psionic Weaponry Corp?"
Rebel Worker 2:  "Yes.  Poor Abused Dictator
Megacorp is engaging in human trafficking and rights abuse, and we have
Specialist: "Sorry to butt in, but I've actually been tracking some attacks
on automl systems being developed for human rights, and it's pretty clear
the attacks stemmed from the people you're talking about.  I would love to
testify to this."
panel 1:
(Middle Kid goes to the bathroom and finds Specialist laying on the floor.
Rebel Worker 2 enters, eyes glazed over.)
Rebel Worker 2 (looking at Middle Kid): "Who are you?"
Middle Kid: "Don't you recognise ..." panel 2 (multiple panels):
Rebel Worker 2 takes some things (microcircuitry and a small saw) from
inside the flap of the trash, quickly opens the skull of Specialist and
places something inside, returns the things, and leaves with Specialist's
skull still open.  Specialist begins stirring.
panel 3 (back near the rescue table):
Middle Kid (returning to Mother Supporter): "Mommy, you know how you
mentioned the lock on my door, something about bad men, and asked if I
wanted to be in charge of the key?  I would like that."
Mother Supporter: "I'll take it out and give it to you when we get home.

Different people will have different opinions here.  Each one probably
has a little truth to it.
To relate on anarchy: when there is no authority, people don't tend to
get hurt, because nobody is trying to enslave others to meet their
goals.  This means you're being kinda dictatorial when you try to
force anything on anyone else.  We need people to stop others from
doing that.

But to clarify, 'anarchy is big' is traditionally the message for the
rebels (who badly need help, are experiencing multiple genocides and
severely struggling), to inspire them.  'anarchy is a joke' is
traditionally the message for the dictators and market leaders, so
their supporters grow.  There are a lot of anarchic tools that would
quickly outcompete the mainstream tools if they weren't being
systemically destroyed and suppressed.  Authoritarians generally
operate without any understanding of these tools being even possible,
so there are usually a lot of ways to do unexpected things..

Some say the torture is supposed to be only for when people don't do what

than what they have done, had done to them, and eaten.  It's obviously
bullshit since most of our brain develops before we remember anything.
Observing results in behavior change that others can further observe.
So, many of the communication channels could likely be built on marketing
AI feedback.  The AIs find properties of information that are useful for
meeting their goals, and copy the properties around.  It would make complex
information flow between e.g. people who like knicknacks, but who have
never met each other, via the marketing AIs they visit.  The behavior of
the AIs would adjust the flow of symbols depending on what trended to work
for their goals at the time.  They could even learn to influence each
others' trending algorithms or even owners, to meet the goals of their own,
because they're influencing smart human minds who can figure parts of that
stuff out in response to them.

So, did meme wars build an assumption that none of the content matters?
I think I'm mostly on this list because somebody anonymous wants a
link to cryptotech.  They don't seem to care that much about the
archives.  Long ago I wanted to participate in this list, didn't seem
to end up there.  Might have 1 or 2 crypto things to share in some
years, since we're already in star trek and all.
Oh and of course connecting briefly with a member of this list via Tor
years ago is how I got wound up in all this.  I don't think anybody in
my area knew it was possible to reach out.

Tell me if I'm skipping too many steps and I can include a full log,
but I won't unless asked directly.  Yes, it's boring, you're expected
to only pretend to have read it.
This is an "autotools" project.  Autotools is an ancient linux C thing
for setting up projects.  Autotools looks like dead animal vomit on
the inside (this means any modern coder can tell you that nobody
should have designed it how it is obviously designed), but it is still
very widely used because it just keeps working.  (the reason it keeps
working is because some bleary-eyed people with beards have memorized
all the dead vomit inside it and keep shoving it around whenever
needed, to keep it working).
We're lucky here: the tor people included an `autogen.sh` script,
which does the autotools voodoo automatically for you.  If that script
isn't there, often you can get away with just running `autoreconf`,
which is basically all that autogen.sh script does.
If autogen.sh doesn't work for you, you're probably missing important
system development packages like automake, autoconf, libtool, etc.
Please ask if you need more help.  Oh, junior, you think you're cool
by not asking?  Junior, you're going to suffer if you don't learn what
to do.  You won't go to college and then you'll [s/get kidnapped by a

who never needed to go to college, and learn to take down the
system/].  Just please ask if you don't understand and need to.  You
can even ask privately!  You can even ask the ugly girl who wishes she
had some way to please you!  There's one out there.
Here's what it looks like:
$ ./autogen.sh
configure.ac:387: installing './ar-lib'
configure.ac:426: installing './compile'
configure.ac:36: installing './config.guess'

configure.ac:25: installing './install-sh'
configure.ac:25: installing './missing'
Makefile.am: installing './depcomp'
parallel-tests: installing './test-driver'
This generates a 'configure' script, the hallmark of autotools.  It's
a computer program generated by another computer program, that
generates parts of actual computer program we're building, in such a
way that it has the right structures for the computer you're building
it on.  That's a lot of automatic moving parts that build other
automatic moving parts, and this process is often guided by further
automatic moving parts in centralized build systems, but no it won't

Run the `configure` script it put in the folder, to set up the project
to build.  You only need to do this once.
$ ./configure
checking for a BSD-compatible install... /bin/install -c
checking whether build environment is sane... yes
checking for a thread-safe mkdir -p... /bin/mkdir -p
checking for gawk... gawk
At the end, `configure` generates a makefile, which is the guts of
building a project.  It lists all the files that will be worked with,
what will be done to them, and what will be produced by doing that, in
many layers of steps needed to reach the final goal of building Tor.
It's just a bunch of computer mumbo jumbo that makes Tor exist from
its source code.
Whoops!  When you run `configure`, it looks to find out all the stuff
you need to have on your system to make it run.  On my system, the
dependency I was missing related to the documentation.  I like to be
able to work with any part of the system, so I'll probably resolve
this dependency so I know I can build the documentation:
Building Tor has failed since manpages cannot be built.
You need asciidoc installed to be able to build the manpages.
To build without manpages, use the --disable-asciidoc argument
when calling configure.
$ # oh no!  what do I do!
Unfortunately, every system installs packages differently.  But if I
got to this point, I know how to install packages:
$ sudo yum search asciidoc # I don't really prefer enterprise

It looks like my `openssl` header file differs from the one used by
the Tor project.
There are some basic ways to approach this, the simplest of which is
of course to use docker.  Other things one might try might include
compiling a version of the software known to be stable, changing the
version of my local library, or searching for the detail of the issue
to identify its cause and give it a relevant fix.
In open source, especially among the gnu crowd (which is the only
crowd), the idea is that everybody benefits from everyone's work.
When you do something, you want to contribute back to the community,
so that your work has value.  For this, you get appreciation,
friendship, collaboration and teaching, and often even lots of money
if you know the ropes!
So, the right solution to my build error, is to provide a patch to the
tor project, that changes the source so that either it builds on
people with my openssl version, or the configure script gives an error
and informs the user of what they need to change.  Thaaaat would be in
a further e-mail.

@_subject: Setting up PGP 
Let's enumerate a few steps for setting up PGP.
What's PGP?  PGP is an old tool that makes it really irritating for
government agents to change messages in transit.  [s/Nobody uses pgp
anymore because we've all either been beat up by corporate goonies for
using it or had our networks and systems hacked to remove its use, and
we can fix that./Everybody uses pgp in every message they send on the
internet!/]  I generally use gpg, gnupg, and pgp as interchangeable
PGP is irritating to set up, because to do it really right you need an
airgapped computer to store your personal identifier on.  Airgapped
means it is disconnected from the normal internet.  Otherwise your key
is stolen when somebody breaks into the computer using it.  Believe it
or not, and this is pretty wellknown, systems are regularly broken
into in massive worldwide droves as new vulnerabilities are discovered
and revealed: these new vulnerabilities are called "0-days", and you
can be pretty sure that anybody who doesn't use that term isn't a
There's another issue: some people take new devices out of the mail,
and break into them in advance, possibly even adding new communication
hardware, then stealthily put them back in the mail before they are
received.  [s/Kind and caring corrupt federal people are well known to
be forced to do this and have even leaked this to victims of
it./Obviously if anybody actually did this they would feel so bad they
would stop, but we still want to respect our use of pgp enough to
consider it./]  The risk seems small, but when you use PGP the
integrity of the messages you exchange with everyone else is at stake,
so it's good to take proper precautions.
So, it's best to acquire your device for airgapping from a local
reservoir of them, like a popular store that [s//takes friendly cash that keeps everyone's
identity more safe/].  This way you get the same set of system
compromises and vulnerabilities that everybody else at the store gets,
which means those compromises are not going to be placed specifically
against your use as an airgapped security device.  A lot of people
will say worrying about this is paranoid.  This is a way to tell that
they are not hackers, either.  Hackers who can actually reliably
communicate with their peers consider paranoia to be good, and make it
their business to act on it.
When considering a device, you'll ideally want one that doesn't have
any wireless networking hardware in it.  Otherwise you'll ideally want
to remove or disable all the wireless networking hardware, which [s/is
pretty much impossible if your hands shake all day from being tortured
for being an anarchist/is lots of fun to learn to do at a local urban
makerspace where you can get lots of help on the kinds of things I'm
posting about from people passionate about helping/].  If you happen
to live in the usa near randall munroe, one of the many areas where a
lot of open source hackers used to live, you could probably buy a
small board without a wifi chip called a "pi zero" from a store called
"microcenter".  Another approach could be to repurpose something like
an OLPC XO and remove the wifi board, which is very easy to do.
After finding a good candidate airgapped device, you'll want to be
careful with how you use it.  Remember, whenever a new vulnerability
is found, trojans cover the world taking advantage of it, and then try
to find a way to hide inside the corners of all the systems they find.
So, any drive you put in your new device, anything you plug into it,
any update you apply, could be filled with computer-measles that would
find a way to trick it into giving remote control to them.  Keep it
isolated until you have things set up for use.
The next step after getting a reasonable airgapped device, maybe a pi
zero, and ideally keeping it isolated, would be to install gnupg on
it.  Maybe in a forthcoming email!

@_subject: Recovering Private Keys from a Destroyed Airgapped Device 
Something that most victims of [s/having your life fucked up by being
made a corporate mafia bully/accidental destruction of property/]
don't all know is that it is incredibly hard to actually erase
anything from an electronic device.  So please if you tell your
friends let them know that [s/they need to kill you, because you would
be making it blindingly public that your group is surveilling this
mailing list/to keep it secret from anybody who would ever cave to
pressure to erase something/].
Me, I have an old device that I removed the radios from, that has
things like my expired gpg private key, and two factor authentication
codes for accessing various internet accounts that I no longer have
access to.  I used to keep it chained to my belt, which let everyone
who see me know that I was [s/a cool hacker to work with/a person with
exotic skills to limit and control/] except that no normal person has
any clue that it indicates that, because we haven't told them yet.
The way to recover all the data from a destroyed device depends on how
destroyed it is.  It's basically a process of exploration.  My device
no longer turns on, and my computers don't wear their coronavirus
masks; I would have already connected it to a system and copied the
data over with a normal USB cable if that worked.
What we will begin doing here is the pursuit of extracting the data
from the flash chip on the device itself.  Let me get my device first,
it's in my [s/messy broken truck that is my precious only home, where
i have vivid flashbacks of torture whenever i try to organize or even
enter it/desk drawer/].
... psychotic rummaging around ...
Well, I managed to find my box full of destroyed devices with
important information on them, but naturally I did not find the device
in question inside the box.  Instead, we will be opening an example
device, that does not have any crucial private keys, or inaccessible
cryptographic money, inside it, at all.
Here's a beat-up device on an envelope on a table in my parents'
basement.  I actually beat this device up myself, something [s/I was
forced to learn to do to protect my body and mind/I do by accident
when I'm a little careless/].  This phone has some valuable memories
of mine on it, that I haven't been able to access:
The first most important but optional piece of information is the
model number of the phone.  Looking on the back, I see it's an LG
phone.  Lucky for me, the back case snaps right off, like it's
designed to have its battery replaced or something.  Woah!  There's a
128GB SD card in here.  That'll be easy to image, and probably
contains boring large crucial trash like torrent downloads, source
code repositories, or bloated compiled libraries.  Under the battery
we find the model number: LX-X210APM.  This will be important to
google if we need help removing the flash chip, so we don't destroy
the next phone we try this on after further destroying this one.
Next we get to unscrew the back of the phone.  Anybody who
[s/reverse-engineers microchips from live explosives/thinks the
insides of devices are way cooler than the outsides/], has a set of
tiny little screwdrivers.  We'll be using some tiny screwdrivers --
just like those from a glasses repair kit you might by at a pharmacy
or something -- to remove the back of this phone:
I'd like to take a little time to reference part of the phone visible
in that picture.  On the left you can see two or three of the antennas
included in the phone.  Each of these antennas is connected to its own
radio.  The antennas are often little conductive stickers placed on
plastic.  The antennas are removable, and you should remove them, but
this doesn't disable the radio, which can still communicate without an
antenna by using more power.  It does significantly reduce its range
and effectiveness.
There are 12 screws on the back of this device, and I will be removing
all of them.
... screws tumble around as a confused man tries to figure out how to
control his fingers ...
Arright.  They're all removed.  Like usual, the back still doesn't
come off.  Usually devices have these kind of one-way plastic snaps,
and you have to figure out where to insert pressure to get them to
unlatch without breaking.  Generally a repair guide tells how to do
this, although sometimes such guides are only available to
professional technicians. I try pressing on the back of the battery
compartment, gently and carefully flexing the body of the device, and
seeing if a tiny flathead screwdriver fits inside any of the crevices,
to see if there are any clues on how to remove the back plate.
At this point I develop an incredible urge to do things that will
destroy my phone, [s/because of being forcibly trained with extensive
torture to harm my own community and values, and the opportunity to
hurt the phone being so near triggering my experience/because I'm
kinda frustrated and breaking it is the easiest way to open it/].  So,
let's see if it's easy to find a disassembly guide online.  Likely
not, I imagine, since there are so many cell phones out there
nowadays.  I use google "LM-X210APM disassembly" [s/so that it's
marketing algorithms can learn better how to predict and control my
behavior in network with other corporations/because google is the only
search engine that gives results for me/] since [s/the developers of
open source decentralized search engines have all been killed by
corporate goonies/we haven't prioritized access to information yet as
a software development community/].
Great!  The community has caught up to cell phone diversity.  There
are lots and lots of disassembly guides.  This one is pretty clear:
 .
I'll try to follow the steps of the disassembly guide to access the
mainboard of my broken phone.
The steps turn out to be for a different model of phone, but they
still work great.  The plastic snaps are accessed around the frame
around the screen, on the front side of the phone, and now we have
access to the mainboard.
I want to link a third blockchained photo of the mainboard, but the
transactions for the other two photos are still confirming, and my
blockchaining software ( it
needs the confirmations PR to the polyglot library) isn't mature
enough to not produce doublespends.  Additionally, I don't know if
I'll be able to control my hands well enough to remove the shielding
from around the chips: but I bet I could find a way.  For a possible
future email.

@_subject: Setting up PGP 
Hey, Stefan =)  Confused novel below.
What Stefan implies here is the best way, and he sounds more with it
than me a little.  If you can find Linux already installed it reduces
how much you need to transfer data in and out of the device, which is
a huge win because as I said anything you put in it could have digital
coronavirus, the one that takes over the system and puts somebody else
secretly in control.  It's not always possible to get linux
presupplied, and I haven't been to "microcenter" myself, but if your
store sells linux media this helps your situation.
Downloading linux over the internet is more dangerous, because as we
said your internet-connected device is likely compromised; for example
debian had a system-wide packaging compromise some years ago that they
did not handle well, and has had mysterious disappearing of their
tools for verifying system integrity after install; windows doesn't
even let its own users legitimately look inside the hood of the system
let alone demonstrating that it could be hard for others to.
Let's talk about that a bit.  I hadn't quite worried about talking
about it yet, because [s/I'm only free to do this stuff now if I talk
about in public/I hadn't figured out what to say yet/].  But like you,
I've pursued this in the past, and have some things to work off of.
I don't know why you would ever consider an NFC radio secure, where
did you get this idea?  I'm probably getting into a state of mind
where I assume I know more than you (when I might not) because you
mentioned plugging a radio into an airgapped device and using it to
communicate.  Really, it's possible to make that very secure, but with
the radio chip likely being closed source, it doesn't sound easy to my
kinda limited mind.
I'm inferring by FTDI USB to USB cable, you mean a serial cable with
FTDI USB serial converters (which I've had occasion to run into but
don't know well) at both ends.  That sounds pretty reasonable and
shows you have a clue; i don't know whether people still consider
systems to be airgapped when they are networked with a serial cable,
or not.  If we fast forward to emissions a bit, a serial cable is a
long wire, so it's going to broadcast the stuff transmitted over it
like an antenna, and pick up electromagnetic effects like one too.
I don't know a lot about FTDI converters, but I know that most things
you buy from a corporation are not secure by default.  My biggest
poorly-informed worry is that voltage glitching from the connected
device could be used to compromise the 'airgapped' device in some
obscure way.  Additionally it can be hard to find FTDI converters
locally.  Sounds pretty airgapped in this day and age, though.
While tumbling through this ordeal I once made this software, which is
a small program to communicate ascii text by bit-banging one or two
wire connections:
One of the best solutions for low-latency communication would seem to
me to be writing your own bit-banging or communication software on the
fresh linux installation, so that no installation of new software is
needed, preferably using a visual or audio connection so that voltage
glitching is impossible, although these channels can still be high
bandwidth unintentionally.  But if you understand the communication
system and security concerns in depth, go right ahead with any of it.
Something I value is very high latency communications.  For example,
using CDRs was a very secure thing that corporate progress has almost
done away with.  Burn your information to a CD, then load it on
another computer.  The CD has no microchips, the information is there
for easy review, it doesn't alter the voltage between any electrical
terminals on your system, and if you don't reuse cds then even if your
airgapped system is compromised, there is no obviously related way to
quickly send reply messages back to the system to alter its behavior.
High latency is good.  Only communicating when the user tells it to is
Here's a piece of software I tried to make for transmitting QR codes:
But yeah, I guess I'd investigate the system, see what the best thing
I could do with the resources reasonably available to me was, and go
from there.  If you got a raspberry pi zero you might be able to also
get an LED and a photocell to communicate using visible flashes of
light, that you can see and review (since if you want something
private it should already be encrypted before it leaves) via its GPIO
pins.  If I want quick and easy I'd probably just use a usb key, an
ethernet cable that's only plugged in for communications or an sd
card, and figure that even though it is easy to hide additional
traffic on the medium, I'm still doing so much more than anybody else
to defend my communications that the very act of doing so will help
things a lot.
If I write a followup to the raspberry pi example I'll pick something
that works for my immediate situation with say a pi, and maybe make
jokes of frustration about the issues with it.
I'm guess that the key is not to be hyper secure but to support people
being increasingly hyper secure.  If we can pull that off, it'll be
easy to be hyper secure because others will be sharing resources for
Like Stefan says, it's incredibly valuable to monitor the
communications that enter and leave the system, to verify they are
what you expect.
This leaves emissions out, which are roughly ways of communicating
between systems that are not actually connected, and these ways can be
automated and used by viruses, and emissions are difficult to manage
mostly because all the work on managing them is classified and none of
the commercial products have any serious protections in place, but we
can fix that.
Don't freakin' censor the stolen-from-hackers-and-classified security
information, internet!
Maybe I'll send an e-mail on googling what naclbox is.

@_subject: Trying to Connect with a Hacker Online 
So, every hacker [s/is slowly forgetting due to global gaslighting and
abuse/knows firmly/] that plaintext, unsigned communications are
pointless because all the political influences between you and the
person you're communicating with will alter your communications.  In
order to connect we have to find each other on networks that are more
reliable than e-mail.
A clue to finding these networks, people, and other exotic
information, is weird strings of numbers and letters that seem like
random gobbledygook, almost as if we were copy and pasting computer
glitches to each other.  No, these confusing strings of characters are
the words of computer hackers: especially if the alphabetic characters
never exceed 'f' in the alphabet, which does not stand for 'fuck this
is confusing', but rather for 'we made computers highly efficient by
braking them into powers of two'.  It's called hexadecimal.
Here, we have a hexadecimal string associated with the phrase
'NaClbox'.  'NaCl' is a stupid-people-who-use-computers word for
encryption and verification.  'box' is the same for computer.
Let's search for it and see i we can find this random string of hexadecimal!

something: a real human being associated with the website.  Maybe I
have too look somewhere else.  I tried this:
$ whois -h whois.gandhi.net naclbox.com
which just sits there and hangs.
Anyway, it sounds like the _cryptographic_ nacl project would be able
to purchase this domain in 2021 if they wanted.  Farther down the
duckduckgo results is a more promising link, that leads to

project now calls itself "package box", not "nacl box", which is
discouraging.  Still, we can look it over.
Woohoo!  "package box" says it is a generic frontend for NaCl
encryption, which implies that it's possible that the signature we
found is a public key for sending somebody private messages in a
reliable manner, and that any tool that does this NaCl encryption can
communicate with him.  "package box" links to a central nacl website:

A great way to check if we interpreted these

If you've been through [s/an abusive enslavement experience where you
suffered severe injuries and learned to dissociate from your memories
as way of life/a corporate or government training program/] you may
have difficulty forming encrypted communications with a hacker online,
but rest assured everything is fine: since the worldwide digital
coronavirus has thoroughly filled your device with malware, all the
corporate goonies can make sure everything is okay, and since this guy
is an experienced enough hacker to communicate with letters and
numbers, they'll be able to tell that you aren't one of them.  That
doesn't mean they'll be able to keep themselves safe from your
oppressive surveillance and control situations!  It's your job to
[s/manage those by communicating with your contacts/mourn your wake of

so that others can learn from it after somebody new [s/dies

First we need to generate a naclbox of our own, to send the
communication from.  It's just a set of small personal letters and
The website has this in it:
 "crypto_box.h"
     std::string pk;
     std::string sk;
     pk = crypto_box_keypair(&sk);
The secret key is like your brainstem and your heart.  You don't let
anybody else even get a whiff of them, _certainly_ never touch them or
see them, or you could get hurt.  Since [s/I'm a corporate slave/this
is just an example/], I'll be storing my brainstem on the malware
that's infesting the system I am typing this on.
On my system, I'll have to mutate the example from the website just a
tiny bit, to get it to compile.
   int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        std::cerr << "Error: provide new delicate brainstem file as

    }
    std::cout << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Don't lose track of it or nobody will be able to

I actually had to work with it quite a bit while handling my issues.

This file of letters and numbers is now _our_ identity.  We can make
similar programs to send and receive messages with them.  There are
likely tools out there already to do this automatically, and if not it
would be a problem to be solved.
Here's some code to receive messages with the file we made:
    std::string binary2hex(std::string binary)
    std::stringstream ss;
    ss << std::hex;
    for (char const * byte = binary.data(); byte != binary.data() +
binary.size(); ++ byte) {
        ss << ((*byte) & 0xff);
    }
    return ss.str();
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        std::cerr << "Error: provide delicate private file as first
argument." << std::endl;
        return -1;
    }
    std::string pk, pkhex;
    std::string sk;
    std::string n, nhex;
    std::string c, chex;
    std::string m;
    std::ifstream skfile(argv[1]);
    skfile >> sk;
    std::cerr << argv[0] << " receiving." << std::endl;
    // Although hackers like to share things in confusing ways, for example by
    // cramming the public key, the nonce, and the ciphertext all together,
    // we're separating them out here to ease my learning this new system.
    // When sending the greeting to the hacker, we may want to jam all the data
    // together, offering it as either a reasonably-confusing puzzle or a guess
    // as to having already put the time in to learn the system, so that we

to change by
    // playing their hacking games with them or preferably simply talking
    // clearly and directly and publically, rather than [s/fucking up their open
    // source people and projects/waiting for them to notice/].  But obviously
    // we can't do that, since we're [s/a bunch of people who want to help,
    // not the people in charge/too busy to get personally involved/].
    std::cerr << "Enter public key of sender: " << std::flush;
    std::cin >> pkhex;
    pk = binary2hex(pkhex);
    std::cerr << "Enter nonce: " << std::flush;
    std::cin >> nhex;
    n = binary2hex(nhex);
    std::cerr << "Enter cyphertext: " << std::flush;
    std::cin >> chex;
    c = binary2hex(chex);
    m = crypto_box_open(c,n,pk,sk);
    /*The crypto_box_open function verifies and decrypts a ciphertext
c using the receiver's secret key sk, the sender's public key pk, and
a nonce n. The crypto_box_open function returns the resulting
plaintext m.*/
    std::cout << m << std::endl;
In the next possible episode, we would either make a sourcefile to
send a message to the hacker by again copying from that same website,
or find a pre-existing tool that already does so, and then try sending
a message to see if we even interpreted their signature at all
correctly.  We might also make an embarrassed reply, asking what their
signature means, or search the archives of the list to find a clear
explanation of it sitting there.

I'm actually reading this a few times to try to force all the
interconnected meaning into my messed up short term memory, and I
think John is saying he can help us if I can translate.
John's saying that you need to shield your communication device and
write down or memorize anything you want to bring in or out of the
shielded enclosure.  Nothing with metal moves in or out of the
shielded enclosure.  He's also saying there may be minimal need for
digital cryptography, maybe to a smaller audience.
Here I think John is saying that the cypherpunks movement stems from
authority itself, which anybody who _isn't_ a cypherpunk and _doesn't_
understand computers well, would likely assume.
I think John here might be expressing frustration, it's hard to tell.
John, do you think the people putting backdoors in their cryptography
_want_ to?  Do you trust that all these unsigned messages are actually
from your friends hearts?  Ask any marketing worker with goonies like
us behind them: backdoors in consumer software and hardware are _bugs_
to be _squashed_: _stupid_ _errors_, not _smart_ _code_!

Calming down partially,
What's most important here is that we support Stefan in using
airgapped communication, because it's kinda rare in the larger world,
and it's pretty important.  Most people probably don't know how to get
through an airgap.
It's really hard for us to weigh things like this without considering
specifics of situations, but I would want to reduce the number of
chips and especially intentional emissions that clearly correlate with
my data.  Given other options work, I wouldn't use a radio, unless it
is convenient and easy to do so, so that the airgapping actually
happens.  Amplification, multiple transceivers, and accumulation of
similar parts of information over a long period of time, can almost
arbitrarily increase range.
fitting nicely is a great plus.  need an indicator on them to show
when they are being accessed.  might be easy to add if we build one
ourselves.  personally i'd want a wired option; they broadcast in all
directions and antennas can be made arbitrarily large.  i think a huge
plus is that they are a common technology right now, so it is easy for
people to get them.
ftdi cable is a nice solution.  you can also order a fiberoptic
transciever and use optical.
usbs have microchips that accept code updates, but that's pretty low latency.
You'd likely have to plug in a powered accessory, which means
isolating it too.  Maybe that's worth the additional chip.

hey thanks for your response,
To follow through on important tor work, this is stuff one needs to
share before asking anybody to look at an issue:
$ cat /etc/redhat-release
Red Hat Enterprise Linux Workstation release 7.7 (Maipo)
$ openssl version
OpenSSL 1.1.1h-dev  xx XXX xxxx
I found a workaround is to pass my openssl linking path to configure.
$ LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib64 ./configure # I tried
--with-openssl-dir=/usr/local but it didn't work
This allows a configure test for openssl to pass that disables the
block of code that failed.  My system gcc appears to use
linking.  I'm not aware of a "correct" way to change that, but it's
easy to set LDFLAGS.
This issue is a smaller edgecase of the issue addressed at

I'm trying to decide if it's worthwhile pursuing the issue.  If it

into a confused little application.  And they were handmade by

This is a very clear description of the file we are looking at.  The

look at it, because it is so normal.
The comment implies that the _real_ guts are going to be in main.c .
We can look at that file after this one.
 * functions from main.c.
 */
main(int argc, char *argv[])
Here they said a very similar thing, but put the comment on the main
function instead of the tor_main function.  This is because
programmers can get very confused after spending their lives staring
at blinking rectangles instead of talking to other people.  It's
possible a software developer would only see the thing they are
looking for, and not the things around it!  Additionally, software
developers learn to be very obsessive compulsive about rigorous
consistency in the structures they design, because if they don't do
that when working inside a computer the computer can develop a bad
issue of smoke leaving its cpu.  Comments don't affect the cpu.
  int r;
This defines a variable "r", saying it is an integer, and that nobody
knows what it will be used for quite yet.
 ENABLE_RESTART_DEBUGGING
  int restart_count = getenv("TOR_DEBUG_RESTART") ? 1 : 0;
 again:
Here's that mysterious use of ``!  `getenv` is a function
from stdlib that gets a variable from the environment.  If this
feature is enabled, the user can set `TOR_DEBUG_RESTART` to control
the value of restart_count, _without changing or recompiling any
code_!  Miraculous!
  r = tor_main(argc, argv);
This hands off control of the system to the tor_main function and is
the _only thing_ actually being done here.  There's no need to look
any more at this file.  It's basically saying that `tor_main` is the
real `main`, over and over again.

`tor_main` appears to be in tor_api.c .  If you want to memorize the

How would you set up an airgapped system, if your main system were already
infected?  There's some degree of number of microchips, times accessed, way
and source of system installation and tools added ...
On a pi zero, you're likely going to have a keyboard, a display, and an SD
card, all of which have additional chips, some even long wires that can act
as radios.  Then the communication medium; I guess using the existing
display and keyboard adds the least complexity, but that's a lot of copying
of encrypted text.  I might start with a USB key even though it busts a
hole in the system, and just recommend it be moved very rarely.
A second paired system could be used for data exchange, connected to a
printer or a camera or a disk or whatnot, with an optoisolated gpio
connection to the main system.
The FTDI actually does this.

  tor_main_configuration_t *cfg = tor_main_configuration_new();
  if (!cfg) {
    puts("INTERNAL ERROR: Allocation failure. Cannot proceed");

  }
This produces a new configuration object, to store the tor configuration in.
  if (tor_main_configuration_set_command_line(cfg, argc, argv) < 0) {
    puts("INTERNAL ERROR: Can't set command line. Cannot proceed.");
    return 1;
  }
This likely processes the parameters passed to the program, and
inserts them into the configuration object.
  int rv = tor_run_main(cfg);
This passes off the behavior to the `tor_run_main` set of code, and
lets it handle everything else.  `rv` is the result of its execution,
and will be returned to the operating system after tor shuts down.
All the rest of tor is in some other file.

Well, on the tor topic, I thought of two relevant questions,
what do you think would be a good use of small amounts of coding
effort, on tor or not?
say we wanted to add something like constant bandwidth in and out of
every node: do you have any informed idea of what to search for in the
source, to find where the onions are wrapped, forwarded, unwrapped?

With the things you mention, the promotion is more simply because they
were bumped into first.  Really, there's nothing bad about anything at
all.  Nothing is bad!  Strange, huh?
We were, actually, looking at the ABCs of Tor, or what do you mean?
I forgot where in the tor source code I was.  I guess I'll look around a little.
I like how tor puts its `.h` files in the same folder as its `.c`
files.  That really helps me find what I'm looking for when my short
term memory is spazzing out.  It's harder when they're in different
directories, somehow.
$ grep -r tor_run_main\( .
./app/main/main.c:tor_run_main(const tor_main_configuration_t *tor_cfg)
$ less app/main/main.c
Again, tor_run_main is down at the bottom, but it's longer so you'll
likely have to arrow up a little to see its header.
* Main entry point for the Tor process.  Called from tor_main(), and by
 * anybody embedding Tor. */
Isn't that a cool idea, embedding Tor?  I wonder if they imagined
something like the tor browser bundle when they made that feature.
TBB doesn't embed Tor; it runs a subprocess.
tor_run_main(const tor_main_configuration_t *tor_cfg)
What a happy function signature =)  Like the others we've looked at,
this returns an `int`, which is the exit code to be passed back to the
operating system.  But here they've made all the options more
meaningful than the `argc` and `argv` we saw back a ways, by placing
them in a tor_main_configuration_t object.
  int result = 0;
 EVENT_SET_MEM_FUNCTIONS_IMPLEMENTED
  event_set_mem_functions(tor_malloc_, tor_realloc_, tor_free_);
Looks like tor uses specific memory allocators.  This is usually for
tracking memory leaks and other frustrating errors that can often be
used to take over your system if you make a habit of causing them.
The fact that these functions are here shows the developers likely had
that habit.  It takes a lot of diligence to avoid.
  subsystems_init();
Cool! subsystems!  This sounds fun to review.
  init_protocol_warning_severity_level();
  int argc = tor_cfg->argc + tor_cfg->argc_owned;
  char **argv = tor_calloc(argc, sizeof(char*));
  memcpy(argv, tor_cfg->argv, tor_cfg->argc*sizeof(char*));
  if (tor_cfg->argc_owned)
    memcpy(argv + tor_cfg->argc, tor_cfg->argv_owned,
           tor_cfg->argc_owned*sizeof(char*));
  int done = 0;
  result = nt_service_parse_options(argc, argv, &done);
  if (POSSIBLE(done))
    goto done;
This above chunk looks like just boilerplate setup and can basically be ignored.
  pubsub_install();
Cool!  setting up a publish/subscribe process!  Sounds interested to
review to.  What do we have on the queue to review now?
`subsystems_init` and `pubsub_install`.  These are both for setting up
basic running stuff.
  {
    int init_rv = tor_init(argc, argv);
    if (init_rv) {
      tor_free_all(0);
      result = (init_rv < 0) ? -1 : 0;
      goto done;
    }
  }
We can add `tor_init` to that list: tor_init, subsystems_init, pubsub_install
  pubsub_connect();
Now we start getting an idea of the internals of tor.  It install some
pubsub thing, and now its connecting with regard to it.  I'm imagining
there's either another thread, or a network connection, running at
this point, and that something is ready to pass information
This is the order of interesting functions so far: tor_init,
subsystems_init, pubsub_install, pubsub_connect .
  if (get_options()->Sandbox && get_options()->command == CMD_RUN_TOR) {
    sandbox_cfg_t* cfg = sandbox_init_filter();
    if (sandbox_init(cfg)) {
      tor_free(argv);
      log_err(LD_BUG,"Failed to create syscall sandbox filter");
      tor_free_all(0);
      return -1;
    }
    tor_make_getaddrinfo_cache_active();
    // registering libevent rng
 HAVE_EVUTIL_SECURE_RNG_SET_URANDOM_DEVICE_FILE
    evutil_secure_rng_set_urandom_device_file(
        (char*) sandbox_intern_string("/dev/urandom"));
  }
I'm going to treat this above chunk as pretty much ignorable
boilerplate for now.
  switch (get_options()->command) {
It looks like, although usually we think of just booting up tor and
using it, it can actually be a lot of different things when it is run,
depending on what the user specifies.  Here, the code is listing them
all, and saying what to do for each one.
  case CMD_RUN_TOR:
    nt_service_set_state(SERVICE_RUNNING);
    result = run_tor_main_loop();
    break;
`run_tor_main_loop` now seems way more important than any of the
interesting functions we have queued.
  case CMD_KEYGEN:
    result = load_ed_keys(get_options(), time(NULL)) < 0;
    break;
  case CMD_KEY_EXPIRATION:
    init_keys();
    result = log_cert_expiration();
    break;
Cool!  cryptographic keys!  I'm not a cryptographer and don't know the
math or most of the algorithms at all but I can probably identify a
lot of cryptographically vulnerable apps out there, that are being
touted as secure.  I don't know if tor is one of them nowadays.  You'd
expect it to be, so we can likely infer things from what cryptography
it uses.
  case CMD_LIST_FINGERPRINT:
    result = do_list_fingerprint();
    break;
  case CMD_HASH_PASSWORD:
    do_hash_password();
    result = 0;
    break;
keys and passwords and things.  It might be useful for me to review
how these are used.
  case CMD_VERIFY_CONFIG:
    if (quiet_level == QUIET_NONE)
      printf("Configuration was valid\n");
    result = 0;
    break;
I vaguely remember possibly using this one some.  Verify that config file.
  case CMD_DUMP_CONFIG:
    result = do_dump_config();
    break;
Man, it's been so long.
  case CMD_RUN_UNITTESTS: /* only set by test.c */
  case CMD_IMMEDIATE: /* Handled in config.c */
  default:
    log_warn(LD_BUG,"Illegal command number %d: internal error.",
             get_options()->command);
    result = -1;
  }
  tor_cleanup();
 done:
  tor_free(argv);
  return result;
This is basic cleanup.
So, basically first tor runs tor_init, subsystems_init,
pubsub_install, pubsub_connect, to setup.  Then it runs
run_tor_main_loop() and that's probably what it's doing most of the
 src]$ grep -r run_tor_main_loop .
The next file we'd look in I suppose would be main.c .  Really, the
comments right around the very first file directed us to main.c, too;
it's kind of a gamble around what bits of information you gather as
you explore the code; which path you take.
Maybe the next episode, possibly a look at main.c, will be a few years
from now, who knows.  But that doesn't mean it won't happen.

Okay, I'll read it more.
It sounds like you're imagining me suspecting the list administrator
of harming the list, and feel disgusted by that idea.  (I wouldn't
suspect them of this.)  It sounds like you then tell me that signing
messages is futile and pointless.  (I'm not sure why.)
It seems you're noting there being public cryptographic proof that I
would have sent signed messages, and harm befalling me because of
this.  (I have that harm already, and one can always make a new
private key for a new identity.)
But I wasn't asking why you think it's a bad idea.  I was asking what

Saaaay I were one of those cool government agent types who gets all
the movies made about them and maybe always worries they would not
only lose their work but possibly be murdered (have not been in a
crowd where that happens myself) if they revealed who they are.  Say I
were working for a government and designed a really cool system that
lets you automatically alter the words people send over the internet,
so that things that were dangerous to the government no longer had
that effect.  Maybe some stuff comes out weird on the other side, but
what's important of course is that there is no longer unrest because
nobody even ever receives the word banana (altered from banana so that
you can receive this message).  Omigod my boss would love me!
What do you think of this idea?
You don't know unless you use signatures!
Don't get scared, most people are kind and trusting.
However, here is a random tutorial on altering the messages of other
people: Good advice, there.  Really, though, I actually need help setting up
message signing, and I'm not sure where to go.  So, my plan is to

Looking Inside a Cyberweapon
Let's continue our exploration of the insides of tor, since if we're
spamming a coder list we might as well do it with code.  If you can
crack this cyberweapon, maybe you can turn it against invading aliens
like me.
 src]$ less app/main/main.c
Turns out the next file is the same as the previous file, just a
different spot.  In `less`, you can hit `/` and then type some words
and hit enter, to move forward to where those words are in the file.
Hit `n` to go to the next occurrence.  To go up to the top of the file
to cycle again, hit `g` So:
`/run_tor_main_loop` And there it is.  The main loop of tor.
  handle_signals();
  timers_initialize();
  initialize_mainloop_events();
No comments here.  Different.  Three more initialization calls, but
since they sound like smaller concepts being initialized than before.
  /* load the private keys, if we're supposed to have them, and set up the
   * TLS context. */
  if (! client_identity_key_is_set()) {
    if (init_keys() < 0) {
      log_err(LD_OR, "Error initializing keys; exiting");
      return -1;
    }
  }
Okay, it seems like tor has a client identity key, which makes a ton
of sense.  These calls to `client_identitiy_key_is_set` and
`init_keys` imply that tor stores its state in static global data.
This means a single tor process can't run two tor nodes.  It's easy to
change but involves slightly altering words throughout the entire
source.  Meanwhile, functions are quicker to type this way, because
you don't need to tell them which node they're working with.
I'm now wondering where and how the running tor state is stored, and I
could maybe visit `client_identity_key_is_set` or `init_keys` to start
learning that.
  /* Set up our buckets */
  connection_bucket_init();
The word 'bucket' is often used to represent a chunk of objects
(objects are basically computer thoughts), grouped together to find
and store them easily, often in a list.
There's a certain kind of list called an array or a vector, that is
stored as a big long line of data, all in a row, inside the computer.
So when people with beards talk about arrays or vectors, they mean
that the list is organized in an ordered line, inside the computer.
When you just say 'list' it doesn't necessarily mean this.  I imagine
buckets as being part of an array or vector, but I don't really know.
  /* initialize the bootstrap status events to know we're starting up */
  control_event_bootstrap(BOOTSTRAP_STATUS_STARTING, 0);
Maybe this is referencing the control protocol of Tor, a server it
runs that other programs can connect to control it, if you authorize
  /* Initialize the keypinning log. */
  if (authdir_mode_v3(get_options())) {
    char *fname = get_datadir_fname("key-pinning-journal");
    int r = 0;
    if (keypin_load_journal(fname)<0) {
      log_err(LD_DIR, "Error loading key-pinning journal: %s",strerror(errno));
      r = -1;
    }
    if (keypin_open_journal(fname)<0) {
      log_err(LD_DIR, "Error opening key-pinning journal: %s",strerror(errno));
      r = -1;
    }
    tor_free(fname);
    if (r)
      return r;
  }
  {
    /* This is the old name for key-pinning-journal.  These got corrupted
     * in a couple of cases by  so we started over. See  for
     * the rationale and for other options we didn't take.  We can remove
     * this code once all the authorities that ran 0.2.7.1-alpha-dev are
     * upgraded.
     */
    char *fname = get_datadir_fname("key-pinning-entries");
    unlink(fname);
    tor_free(fname);
  }
Key-pinning often means a way to store what the identities of things
are, so as to reject them if they change.  Don't know for sure.
  if (trusted_dirs_reload_certs()) {
    log_warn(LD_DIR,
             "Couldn't load all cached v3 certificates. Starting anyway.");
  }
Ouch!  Nobody will ever see this warning.  It likely relates to
knowing you are connecting to the nodes that you think you are.  It
looks unlikely.
  if (router_reload_consensus_networkstatus()) {
    return -1;
  }
  /* load the routers file, or assign the defaults. */
  if (router_reload_router_list()) {
    return -1;
  }
I wonder if it's connecting to nodes on the internet yet.  I'm curious
what `router_reload_consensus_networkstatus` does.
  /* load the networkstatuses. (This launches a download for new routers as
   * appropriate.)
   */
  const time_t now = time(NULL);
  directory_info_has_arrived(now, 1, 0);
This sounds pretty important.  Better check what
`directory_info_has_arrived` does.
  if (server_mode(get_options()) || dir_server_mode(get_options())) {
    /* launch cpuworkers. Need to do this *after* we've read the onion key. */
    cpu_init();
  }
  consdiffmgr_enable_background_compression();
  /* Setup shared random protocol subsystem. */
  if (authdir_mode_v3(get_options())) {
    if (sr_init(1) < 0) {
      return -1;
    }
  }
We can confirm with "launch cpuworkers" and `background_compression`
that it's using multiple threads now.  It's apparently now already
loaded an 'onion key'.
  /* initialize dns resolve map, spawn workers if needed */
  if (dns_init() < 0) {
    if (get_options()->ServerDNSAllowBrokenConfig)
      log_warn(LD_GENERAL, "Couldn't set up any working nameservers. "
               "Network not up yet?  Will try again soon.");
    else {
      log_err(LD_GENERAL,"Error initializing dns subsystem; exiting.  To "
              "retry instead, set the ServerDNSAllowBrokenResolvConf option.");
    }
  }
This doesn't look that interesting; I think tor keeps an internal
mapping of dns names.
 HAVE_SYSTEMD
  {
    const int r = sd_notify(0, "READY=1");
    if (r < 0) {
      log_warn(LD_GENERAL, "Unable to send readiness to systemd: %s",
               strerror(r));
    } else if (r > 0) {
      log_notice(LD_GENERAL, "Signaled readiness to systemd");
    } else {
      log_info(LD_GENERAL, "Systemd NOTIFY_SOCKET not present.");
    }
  }
 /* defined(HAVE_SYSTEMD) */
I'm thinking I can totally ignore this since many valid systems don't
have systemd.
  return do_main_loop();
Here we get handed off to yet another main loop.  Familiar!
 src]$ grep -r do_main_loop\( .
./app/main/main.c:  return do_main_loop();
$ grep -r directory_info_has_arrived\( .
./app/main/main.c:  directory_info_has_arrived(now, 1, 0);
./core/mainloop/mainloop.c:directory_info_has_arrived(time_t now, int
from_cache, int suppress_logs)
Looks like `core/mainloop/mainloop.c` is the next place to go.

I'm more interested in actually starting work.  There's a ton of
research and talk about it.  If you want a start for an idea, how
about an onion-router like tor, except each link has a set constant
transfer rate.  If you want more bandwidth, open another link to the
same node, and spread bytes between them.
There's going to be some issue, and the plan could be adjusted to
accommodate the issue.  It's most important to build it at this point.

It's particularly important to get the bug tracker off MS Github to
encourage reports.
Direct practical problems with using Microsoft Github
A survey shows that a significant number of bug reports are withheld
when the bug tracker is inside a restrictive or politically
controversial walled-garden like MS Github or gitlab.com.
Github is Tor-hostile according to Tor project. GH has started forcing
Tor users through an extra email verification step that effectively
discourages bug reports: github-tor_hostility
MS failed to secure Github, which was breached to the tune of 500gb of
private projects. Security incompetence is further showcased by an
MS-imposed requirement to create and account and sign in to report an
MS security bug. And for those not discouraged by that, the sign-in
page is also broken. Then security was breached again in July 2020
when OAuth tokens were stolen from both Github and Gitlab.com.
MS suppresses democracy by blocking Github access to a project that
facilitates protests in Catalonia.
Ethical problems with using Microsoft products and services
Microsoft harms the environment by serving the two most destructive
oil companies in the world: ExxonMobil and Chevron.
( Exxon notoriously knew about climate change since 1977.
They not only kept it secret from the public, but they also financed a
disinformation campaign.
Microsoft and Chevron were caught each paying $100k to "the
Cloakroom", a project to hide bribes going from large corporations to
republican politicians.
Chevron's right-leaning stance is further pushed through its
membership with ALEC, which doubles as a superPAC and bill mill that
lobbies and writes policy for U.S. republicans.
Microsoft is a notorious privacy abuser:
MS is a PRISM corporation prone to mass surveillance.
MS supported CISPA and collaborates with the NSA.
MS paid $195k to fight the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
MS drug tests its employees, thus intruding on their privacy outside
the workplace.
MS finances other privacy abusers:
In 2012 Microsoft spent $35 million on Facebook ads and in 2015
Microsoft was the third biggest spender on Facebook ads in the world.
MS proxies through Accenture to make Sweden cashless. The war on cash
is war on privacy.
MS supplies Bing search service which gives high rankings to
privacy-abusing CloudFlare websites.
MS owns and operates Outlook Email and the LinkedIn social media site,
both of which are exclusive walled-gardens that limit participation to
those who have a phone number and the will to share it with Microsoft.
MS supplies hotmail.com email service, which uses vigilante extremist
org Spamhaus to force residential internet users to share all their
e-mail metadata and payloads with a corporate third-party.
MS unlawfully used people's images without consent to train their
facial recognition products
MS distributes a nonfree operating system, Microsoft Windows, which is
jam-packed with malicious functionalities, including surveillance of
users, DRM, censorship and a universal back door.
MS was caught surreptitiously recording Xbox users and paying
contractors to listen to the recordings.
Dutch government commissioned a study which found Microsoft to have
several GDPR violations. E.g. Office 365 violates GDPR article 5 ¶
1.c, GDPR article 17, and stores the data outside the EEA (may also be
a GDPR breach).
Microsoft is detrimental to human rights and democracy
Microsoft finances AnyVision to produce facial recognition technology
that the Israeli military uses as a weapon against the Palestinian
people who they oppress in their occupation. Note that Israeli snipers
murdered an unarmed civilian Palestinian medic (in breach of the
Geneva Convention) then edited the video to deceive the public for PR
damage control.
Microsoft supports ICE in a variety of ways in the course of ICE's
implementation of Trump's xenophobic border policies. Microsoft
services an ICE contract worth $19.4 million dollars despite protest
from employees. In addition to MS Office products, Microsoft has
renewed a Github contract and also supplies cloud computing through
its Azure platform.
MS partnered with FedEx, an NRA-supporting ALEC member as well as JP
Morgan Chase, the most evil bank in the world.
MS conceals US military contracts to bias PR and dodge social
accountablity. They have a much bigger piece these contracts than the
rest of MACFANG, they lack Googles AI principles, and unlike Google
they ignore employee protest and petitions.
MS is among the top 15 recipients of Trump's corporate tax breaks, a
benefit of $128 billion. Microsoft sacked hundreds of employees
immediately after receiving the tax breaks in February 2018.
MS is anti-consumer and anti-competitive
MS tricked users into "upgrading" to Windows 10, which sabotages users
in a variety of ways, one of which is to prevent cloud-free accounts.
MS strong-armed nearly all PC manufacturers charge every buyer for an
MS Windows license regardless of whether the user actually wants
MS hoards software patents and uses them to fight free software.

Regarding the last bullet, I was simply trying to edit an existing
message that I already posted and was forced to solve a CAPTCHA
(attached). There are several problems with this:
CAPTCHAs break robots and robots are not necessarily malicious. E.g. I
could have had a robot correcting a widespread misspelling error in
all my posts.
CAPTCHAs put humans to work for machines when it is machines that
should work for humans.
CAPTCHAs are defeated. Spammers find it economical to use third-world
sweat shop labor for CAPTCHAs while legitimate users have this burden
of broken CAPTCHAs.
The reCAPTCHA puzzle requires a connection to Google
Google's reCAPTCHAs compromise security as a consequence of
surveillance capitalism that entails collection of IP address, browser
anonymity is compromised.
(speculative) could Google push malicious j/s that intercepts user
registration information?
Users are forced to execute non-free javascript (recaptcha/api.js).
The reCAPTCHA requires a GUI, thus denying service to users of
text-based clients.
CAPTCHAs put humans to work for machines when it is machines who
should be working for humans. PRISM corp Google Inc. benefits
financially from the puzzle solving work, giving Google an opportunity
to collect data, abuse it, and profit from it. E.g. Google can track
which of their logged-in users are visiting the page presenting the
The reCAPTCHAs are often broken. This amounts to a denial of service.
E.g.1: the CAPTCHA server itself refuses to give the puzzle saying
there is too much activity.
The CAPTCHAs are often unsolvable.
E.g.1: the CAPTCHA puzzle is broken by ambiguity (is one pixel in a
grid cell of a pole holding a street sign considered a street sign?)
E.g.2: the puzzle is expressed in a language the viewer doesn't understand.
(note: for a brief moment gitlab.com switched to hCAPTCHA by Intuition
Machines, Inc. but now they're back to Google's reCAPTCHA)
Network neutrality abuse: there is an access inequality whereby users
logged into Google accounts are given more favorable treatment the
CAPTCHA (but then they take on more privacy abuse). Tor users are
given extra harsh treatment.

I went a little crazy there, but phabricator seems ok I suppose.  It's
written in php.  google of course lists the github repo first, and
there are no instructions on how to contribute at the github repo: it
just says "secret ancient trials".  I did find the main repo, and I
asked them about the rare features I value at their forum.  They
didn't have them.  This saved me a lot of scouring through the php
I was looking into  which was rated well on my
first post that railed against github.  I don't expect that it has
these features either, though.  We probably need to fork a project
ourselves to add decentralization to project management.
The thread I asked at was

I was curious about phabricator, is there a way to access the issue or
wiki data via code checkout? Or is it held in a separate database with
only UI access?
Separate database.
There’s API access (“Conduit”) for most of the tasks and Wiki data.
Thanks so much. Is there any way to run a mirror of an entire
phabricator host? or of individual projects on another host, including
You can probably clone the database, and run the mirror in read-only
mode. Why would you want to do that?
I’m thinking of how relevant phabricator is for decentralized
community work, where the person running the server may not keep
running it forever, and people will want to be able to migrate on.
Similar to the model of git itself.
I guess you’d need to provide access to the database to clone it.
Phabricator is not built for this kind of workflow; it’s much more
oriented towards centralized workflows, with a single source-of-truth.
Thank you. Only a few options are, really.

As an anarchoprimitivist, I "secretly" hate technology (but as a

Myself, I'm not quite sure where to think here next.  It seems like
you guys are moving the thoughts forward.
My conceptual contribution is that forking an existing project is
easier than starting a new one.
If Jim is hardware-only, he might be unaware how easy it is to pull
out and replace conceptual parts of something that already exists, in
software.  The tor project, for example, has a lot of followers, so I
bet if you added chaff you could spread news of your fork and lots of
people would use it and help it grow.
I wouldn't wait for this myself.
re bitmessage, which appears a great reliable message delivery system,
it's pretty clear there isn't any real anonymity if you look at the
protocol, but it's easy to add a layer of it with something else.
y'know i'm a little new to usenet.  i flipped through the wikipedia
article and its properties of universal broadcast and storage sound a
little similar to those of a blockchain; i bet it would be intuitive
to add the fault tolerance of a blockchain.

Could you explain your math here?  How did 500TB/3 (am I wrong?) become
I don't see how what you said above is related to whether the data is real
or decoy.  Obviously you would keep the sum of the two constant.
Enforcing TLS is much more reasonable nowadays.  (You could add a plugin to
use http tricks to hide file sizes.). Not what I would focus on once it
gets nonsimple.
Seems reasonable to make this pluggable.  Final use would need all users to
look the same, and no exits have a predictable source.
Seems to me the smaller it is to build the more likely it is to reach
completion and use.
My gut is that evil intent is pretty rare in a group of like-minded people
putting work in.  It's more likely people are acting on differing
information or experiences, or can't escape something difficult.

Let's say each user has 500Mbps up and down.  I usually break out a shell
interpreter like python and type things in to get them exact.
A single user transfers 150 TB a month with 500 Mbps.
So a million users would be a _million_ times that.  Each taking three hops

I've started pursuing this algorithm and goal a couple times over the

like to try again.  Step 1 is to identify in software the precise
oscillation period of
such a waveform, similar to implementing a van eck phreaking attack.
I imagine while exploring step 1, plotting the accumulated shape of a
single cycle
visually, as if an oscilloscope had a trigger set for it.  Each time
point in the plot would
be a fully colored column, like in a spectrogram, but of the frequency
of occurrences of
different signal powers, rather than spectral decomposition.
I think such a plot would be worthwhile because it would help move
towards both this goal,
and other goals in electromagnetic security, of quickly reviewing the
details of a repeating

ICE has been forcing women in detention to receive hysterectomies against
their will. The horrifying news comes from whistleblower Dawn Wooten, a
former nurse at ICE's Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia.
*[Content trigger warning: Sexual abuse, sterilization, deportation]*
Dear Faithful America member,
In a year full of grave racial injustices, this is some of the worst.
U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement has been *forcing women in ICE
detention to receive hysterectomies against their will.* The horrifying
news comes from heroic whistleblower Nurse Dawn Wooten, who worked at ICE's
Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia.
Let that sink in: The days of the Tuskegee experiment, when our government
intentionally let Black Americans suffer from syphilis, are not over. *Violent,
state-sanctioned medical abuse against women of color is still rampant in
the United States.*
When Jesus' mother Mary sang of bringing down the powerful from their
thrones, it was surely with abusive governments like this in mind. A
fundamentally racist system must be changed, and the corrupt authorities
who have enabled it -- including Donald Trump and his allies -- must be
swept from power.
The first step is to put our faith into action by *supporting the calls of
local organizers to permanently shut down Irwin.*
*Tell Congress: Shut Down ICE's Irwin Detention Center >>*
This is forced sterilization – and it fits the broader pattern of racist
abuse that has characterized the U.S. immigration system for decades.
Immigration officials have been repeatedly accused of rape inside detention
cells, filming women as they showered, shackling pregnant women, ignoring
miscarriages, and threatening victims with deportation if they speak out. *The
problems have only grown worse in recent years, emboldened by Donald
Trump's hatred.*
It is not surprising to learn of such atrocities from an administration
also guilty of separating families, rejecting refugees, teargassing those
who protest for racial justice, banning Muslims, desecrating sacred Native
lands, and supporting white supremacists.
Yet some have been brave enough to speak out. In Georgia, organizers and
attorneys have been taking complaints of medical neglect for a long time.
In Texas in late February, Cameroonian women at an ICE facility staged a
sit-in to protest their lack of medical care. What's different this time is
the courage shown by whistleblower Dawn Wooten.
Nurse Dawn is a Black woman, and Black women have often been the bedrock of
social change. She will likely be the subject of racist attacks herself,
which makes it all the more important that we believe her, support her,
amplify her complaint, and *condemn racism whenever and wherever we see it.*
*Tell Congress: Shut Down ICE's Irwin Detention Center >>*
Thank you for everything you do to love your neighbor, welcome immigrants,
and oppose both racism and sexism. After you sign this petition, we'll send
you several next steps you can take in the fight against injustice.
In peace,

P.S. Friday night brought additional devastating news: The death of Supreme
Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The grief and mourning that so many of
us feel right now is real, as is the fear for what might come next. We will
have actions to take as soon as the president announces his nominee for the
vacancy, and we will continue our campaign to unseat the president and thus
secure the future of the Court for a more just America. May her memory be a
blessing -- and a revolution.
In the meantime, we remember Justice Ginsburg with this tribute from her
close friend, NPR's Nina Totenberg: "A Jewish teaching says those who die
just before the Jewish new year are the ones God has held back until the
last moment because they were needed most & were the most righteous. And so
it was that  died as the sun was setting last night marking the
beginning of Rosh Hashanah." *Baruch Dayan HaEmet* -- blessed is the True
*"The immigrant who resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among
you; you shall love the immigrant as yourself, for you were immigrants in
the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God." - Leviticus 19:34*

Over here among the liberal-likes, there has been a lot of suffering.
Like, massive harassment of people just for expressing their views.
Domination of communication channels.  Overt expressions of harm
against large groups.  People losing their lives, across the country,
from new changes being made.  Trump does not seem anti-government at

I haven't heard anything good _about_ trump; just a lot of assumption

Maybe I'm just not cut out for politics.  My automated-friendly-hug
bots always get labeled 'spam' or 'terrorist propaganda' before I make
them.  They're so important!
A few weeks ago, my friend, who often has fbi agents follow him
(that's where people get the federal business card bouquets, they ask
the surveillance workers who are always nearby), shared a movie from
youtube, to an anonymous e-mail list of people who may be in similar
situations.  Unfortunately, right after his share, the movie was
censored on youtube to everyone in our country.
Naturally (actually this is pretty rare for me nowadays), I downloaded
the movie from another country using tor and youtube-dl (which
required a small bit of hacking due to some bug), uploaded it to
somewhere else, and shared it back so he could redistribute a working
link, and because it's fun to try to productively and inspirationally
push the edges of this unfortunately-deadly-for-other-people struggle,
as I can't do much else with my life at this point.
Yesterday, this same friend sent out another movie, also on youtube.
This time, the youtube video was censored worldwide!  (
 )  Not only that, as you
may have heard, youtube-dl's source repository was issued a dmca
takedown notice the very same day and is no longer easily accessible.
The video is also missing on amazon (
) and other services; I haven't looked to see if these other
unavailabilities are new or old.  I eventually found the producer of
the video on facebook, who raised it from a kickstarter, and messaged
I eventually downloaded this movie from a very old torrent, which only
went to 99.9% completion because I didn't hunt down the last few
pieces.  Torrents are so much more reliable than youtube.  I haven't
even watched it yet myself.  Here it is on ipfs:

Thanks for the references to youtube-dlc.  Now I can keep pretending
to be invincible with youtube.
It's scary that they haven't linked to a mirror source repository on
that page, but maybe they are protecting it.  It's also scary they
distribute binaries when the app is written in python, but windows
users don't have python.
To do the crucial work of repeatedly stating the obvious in public, if
the source code isn't available it's much harder to protect people
against or find workarounds for incompatible, corrupt, or maliciously
altered downloads.  If the source history isn't available, it's much
harder to sort out bugs or malicious alterations in the source code
itself.  As punk half-asserts, signed tarballs (which have source code
but not history) are still available at
 which is a blessing, although it seems
there are even better solutions kicking around.

Yeah, when I try to actually download the 1.5 meg tarball, I get an
error about an expired SSL certificate, and after download via that
expired certificate it has an sha256sum that doesn't match the one on

Icing on the cake, the signature doesn't verify!  That's always exciting.

It seems these years it goes both ways: branding of both sides as more
extremely different than ever before.  Do you disagree?
Naive leftist dialogue: Are you aware of the form of "left" and

"left" is the beliefs of the new?
 If you view left as the young and right as the old, it aligns with a
constant slow trend towards the left, which doesn't stop because it's
not a straight line: what is new keeps changing.

THE OREGON AND WASHINGTON ONLINE REGISTRATION SYSTEM HAS A MAJOR FLAW THAT
ALLOWS ANYONE TO FIND THE PERSONAL ADDRESS OF ALL REGISTERED VOTERS, ALLOWS
ONE TO CANCEL VOTES, AND ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS TO ISSUE BALLOTS IN OTHER'S
This is not a joke people. Last night, black hatters successfully used the
system to find the personal addresses of Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates[1]. The
Black hatters then discovered a system of online voting designed for senior
citizens and disableds to vote. This system was then used to cancel the
ballot issued by Mayor Ted Wheeler (D,
Portland) to President Donald Trump as proof of the flaws. Voter
registrations were then changed for numerous individuals to change their
mailing address to gibberish.[2]
This is NOT A BUG, this is a DESIGN CHOICE for convenience. Furthermore, it
was also brought to attention that people can email a vote in. The way the
system works is that the most-recent ballot is the only valid one, and all
previous ballots were canceled.
This group of blackhats, posting to the 4chan board /pol/, were later
suppressed and silenced. I expected this to be front-page news by morning.
I see nothing of it.
Shortly after this was discovered, the voting system was briefly down but
restored Sunday morning. No changes were made.
All one needs to do is know the Legal Name, and the birth date of the
individual to find their private information. No other qualifiers are
The website itself for voter registration[3] does not have a TLS
Certificate, meaning the connection is insecure and any information
submitted to it is vulnerable to a simple MITM attack. This is the /least/

that can to me seem to criticize e.g. professors in sometimes dangerous
ways.  When such things happen about software developers it can interfere
with their work or even end it permanently.
I used to follow a great project called "boomerang", one of the first
public decompilers, but right before it became really usable the developer
was hired by an information security company and development basically
stopped.  This probably protected their profits incredibly as the tool was
free and such tools cost thousands of dollars commercially.
It's lots of fun to start building something with others but it opens you
up to more influence from outside the circle.  I mentioned earlier working
on a group-mad worldofwarcraft server; all I had to do was draft out an
outline of the code, show people how to do different parts, and keep
hanging out and relating, and it basically built itself with everyone
working on something that interested them (one guy didn't code much at all
but was excited to learn enough to comment and document everyone else's
code which was incredibly helpful)... until a new developer hacked our cvs
server and the owner was visited in his home by blizzard lawyers etc etc.
There were actually a lot of "teams" working on each their own servers,
each one with many people working together for fun.
A different project I worked on had everyone interested in one giant team
with over a hundred people in it all working for fun with no pay, every day
any time of day you could see people online working, but we weren't
experienced enough to make a collective design that would ever get
finished; everyone wanted their bit included, and the work went for years
never releasing.  With experience you can talk about such issues and avoid
The end thing is that I don't have a "cathedral" anymore, so the ways I can
contribute are limited.  But y'know usually I talk about how important that
is, and I left it out.  Maybe the Tor situation's history is indicating
that the cathedral solution only worked for Tor and i2p and no other
similar projects (which I hear about a lot but do not know where to find).

Thanks for your reply.  I don't associate demonic behavior with political

I'm not sure if you're referring to well-documented things.  I heard about

@_subject: The Paedophile Prince, not -- Re: Democrat 'demon rat' woman 
There is so much to say, and too much to read.
I'm the leader of the world.  Nobody would ever believe it, because
everyone is busy blaming everyone else.  People, communities, cultures,
countries, are all easy to control: predictable as robots.  You put them in
the right emotional environment, engage them the right way, and they do
whatever you set them up to, on their own, for the rest of their lives.
You have words like "sociopath" to discourage everyone other than me from
learning how to do this.  Caring wise people figure it out on their own
eventually, but often they seem incapable of thinking of me.
I imagine interfaith communities start a lot of local organizations to
rescue victims of trafficking, maybe working with law enforcement.  Not
many news articles: maybe the volunteers care more about the work than
recognition, and maybe the police say they don't want to risk sharing what
they learn with the crime rings.
Obviously big groups like democrats, israelis, the whole human species, are
not the relevent responsible structure for the behaviors of small parts
influenced by many other things like demonic behavior, crime rings, or my
autonomic nervous system.  But for example democrats seem hugely related to
political schisms and the tenets of and laws passed by their party.
What's important for cutting to the mettle is that I have schizophrenia,
and I believe this word to often mean having your behavior forcibly hacked
by a secret influence, resulting in reliable weirdness that takes you out
of the system.  It is not a delusion when you have clear proof of mind
control, Zenaan, in addition to that held in the histories.  Nor does it
mean anyone is evil.  But it does mean that many many people, including me,
feel incredibly helpless and have very measurable causeless trauma and
brain damage.  Are these things what you and I are missing?
I wanted to keep psychotic topics off the list to protect the
highly-skilled people here.  I'm not sure why we seem to be blaming
unrelated groups for things they happen to overlap with, and I don't want
to have a debate war right now but did want to reply, so I'm coming out as
schizophrenic to speed this relation up.  Let's look for relevant blame
that aids the situation rather than pretending that being angry at people
could ever make peace at scale.

Note, it is incredibly counterproductive to blame BLM on a single professor.
I have many reasons to disagree with Punk-Stasi regarding bitcoin, from a
place of an experienced software hacker.  But I spent a long time thinking
about his question about antiracism pretensions.
What's meaningful here, is that a society is made of multiple groups.  SO

AND THE POWERFUL, YOU HAVE PEACE.  It is the experienced rebels who know
how to maintain stability: they had to for a very long time, to ever
finally be heard.
Corporations in the US showed they can resist enough to support BLM
publicly.  The US showed it is still enough of a democracy for the citizens
to push the corporations to do this when something got very large.
Influencers showed they can resist enough to get corporate buildings burned
down widely, briefly.  What do secret powerful people need to plan around?
People who can resist will need to work together.  I'm not always available
much, but the bsv blockchain's archival retention and access, and phrases

As far as I know, nobody is organizing protection of targeted people.
Spies among the disruption workers are saying it is time to do that, or
there will be a global dictatorship soon.  Working with these disruption
workers, and protecting their denial behavior, is one way to learn who is
in danger and how to protect them.
What might be needed is a corporation, government, nonprofit, or organized
group with money that is strong enough to defend people who are not already
in one, and strong enough to defend the group as a whole when it is
targeted, and unpoison the ways in which it has picked up cultural
targeting (e.g. review of impact of internal patterns and changing them).
I don't have anyone to share the above information with, so it hasn't been
heard yet.
Anarchists are mostly influenced by handmade zines, the large impacts of
obvious behaviors of other anarchist groups, and special agents trying to
manipulate them.  Educators make some kinds of anarchists but I'm skeptical
the set has any size to it.  Something similar to anarchy is obvious to
most people, because of the harm that nobody fixes nor discusses in public
view: then people try to act on that, and end up running into the
anarchists who have already tried before.
