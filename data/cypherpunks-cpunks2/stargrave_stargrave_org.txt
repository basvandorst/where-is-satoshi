There is no "world" or "common" standards. Standards are always related
to something.
What is the problem? S-box is not randomly chosen? Does it hurt this
blockcipher security? No. So there is no objective barries on using it.

*** xorcist at sigaint.org  [2016-09-19 23:25]:
As Wikipedia says (  ),
Streebog uses Merkle-Damgård construction and mathematically is more
closed to SHA1/SHA2 and similar hash functions. It can be called rather
"classic" construction, but much more effective and simple that previous
GOST R 34.11-94 hash function standard.
So many things related to those classic SHA1/2-like functions are
appliable to GOST R 34.11-2012 too.
By the way, it should be called "Streebog"", "Stribog".

@_subject: Russian FOSS activist arrested for extremist materials/Tor exit-node 
Dmitry Bogatov was arrested on the 6th of April: he became part of the
big penal case initiated by Russia’s Investigation Committee on
"incitations to mass riots" during the protest action that took place on
the 2nd of April in Moscow. According to the Investigation Committee,
Bogatov was publishing messages on the forum sysadmin.ru, inciting to
violent actions, for example, "he" was suggesting to bring to the Red
Square "bottles, fabric, gasoline, turpentine, foam plastic". According
to the Investigation, the experts had analyzed the text of these
messages and proved a "linguistic and psychological characteristics of
incitations to terrorism". However, Dmitry claims that he has nothing to
do with posting the incendiary messages.
Dmitry Bogatov, 25 years old, teaches maths in MFUA (Moscow Finance and
Law University) was a free and open source software activist
Dmitry was administrating a Tor exit node
from his house. In fact, the author of "incendiary messages" (called
"Airat Bashirov") was using Tor, and, by lack of chance, he used the ip
adress of Dmitry's exit node.
Dmitry's lawyer, Alexei Teptsov, presented videos from surveillance
cameras, that proved that, during the moments when the "incendiary
messages" were posted, Dmitry was away from his computer. He was coming
back from a fitness center with his wife, Tatiana, a genetician, and
then went to a supermarket, where cameras were also working. Moreover,
"Airat Bashirov", the author of the provocative messages, continues to
post on sysadmin.ru, while Dmitry is under arrest. The last post was
seen on the forum on April 11.
Dmitry will stay in pre-trial detention center until June 8 at least.
Now the Investigation is examining all his seized devices.
Dmitry Bogatov aka KAction, Russian free software activist and
mathematics teacher at Moscow’s Finance and Law University, arrested in
Russia and charged with extremism.

@_subject: Why I can't sleep soundly with blockchain, being the cypherpunk 
Greetings, fellow cypherpunks!
There is so much hype about blockchain technologies! Everyone is
fascinated about it, dream about wonderful bright cryptofuture, and
stops talking with me, when hears that I do not find blockchain either
interesting or useful.
Why I do not like blockchains? Actually *if they would work*, from
cryptographic point of view, then I have nothing against! Distributed
trusted databases, timestamps and consensus making are great things to
deal with. But unfortunately I see that at least Bitcoin (the biggest
blockchain in use) has already failed without human-initiated
regulations[0]. It failed from *cryptographic* point of view.
I am cypherpunk and I am very interested and excited about cryptography
subjects. Why? Because all of that is based on math and assumptions
about practical impossibility of reverting many functions (you know,
some kind of "2^100 of operations are required for ..."). It is valuable
because you do not have to trust and rely on people *at all*. Well,
except for cryptographers and similar scientists. People are the problem
 in all security questions. They can be bribed, all of them have their
price. They are error-prone, not reliable, lie and misbehave easily. I
can not sleep soundly, knowing that I depend on some human. Cryptography
world gives unbelievable possibility to eliminate them!
If I can easily remember relatively long passphrase (100-120 characters
in practice) as a key to proven strong authenticated encryption
algorithm, then I am confident that my data is safe. I can use
eavesdropped links and virtually any potentially vulnerable storage when
cryptography is applied correctly. While noone ever know if quantum
computers powerful (big) enough will be built, RSA/ElGamal/ECC stay
pretty safe too. I really love the fact of security risks estimation
possibility, based on current technology state and progress. People can
fail you anytime -- only *hope* will keep you calm.
Are you afraid of algorithms breaking possibility? Even one of the first
encryption algorithm used in computer era -- DES, is still useful and
secure enough in 3DES composition. If you are still frightened, then
learn from soviets: their GOST 28147-89 block cipher[1], created in
1970s, still has more than 2^200 security margin. Who the hell knows
what "key meshing"[2] means? But that block cipher has that kind of
thing, making it immune to Sweet32 attack, appeared dozens of years
after. Do not overestimate value of performance, by sacrificing its
security -- perfect advice for sleeping well for years.
But what about blockchains? Citing Ethereum's "problems" wiki page[3]:
    While a cryptographer is used to assumptions of the form "this
    algorithm is guaranteed to be unbreakable provided that these
    underlying math problems remain hard", the world of cryptoeconomics
    must contend with fuzzy empirical factors such as the difficulty of
    collusion attacks, the relative quantity of altruistic,
    profit-seeking and anti-altruistic parties, the level of
    concentration of different kinds of resources, and in some cases
    even sociocultural circumstances.
Everything is right here. Anyway you *will* depend on people, society,
its behaviour and huge quantity of empirical factors and assumptions. It
is not cypherpunk's reliable and risks-predictable world -- it has
nothing in common. Replacing the need to trust the human, with the need
to trust the algorithm and technology -- that *is* the exact reason why
I am interested in crypto. Requiring and depending on society again --
that is the exact reason why I standing aside from blockchains. They do
not offer any guarantees[4], but likelihoods, lottery.
Cypherpunk must rely and depend on people as little as he can. Remember
cypherpunk's manifesto[5] -- spread as little unnecessary information as
possible, because people *will* find ways how to harm you with it. And
blockchains are broadcasting permanent storages, where most of them
(with Zcash[6] exception for example) give you neither privacy nor
anonymity for your personal (private) transactions.

@_subject: NNCP -- store-and-forward E2EE F2F network building utilities 
Node to Node copy  is a collection of utilities
simplifying secure store-and-forward files and mail exchanging.
This utilities are intended to help build up small size (dozens of
nodes) ad-hoc friend-to-friend (F2F) statically routed darknet networks
for fire-and-forget secure reliable files, file requests and Internet
mail transmission. All packets are integrity checked, end-to-end
encrypted, explicitly authenticated by known participants public keys.
Onion encryption is applied to relayed packets. Each node acts both as a
client and server, can use push and poll behaviour model.
Main difference from existing UUCP and FTN solutions, except encryption
and authentication, is out-of-box offline sneakernet/floppynet, dead
drops and air-gapped computers support. But online TCP daemon with
full-duplex resumable data transmission exists and is built on top of
Noise protocol Where can it be useful? Occasional connection between mail servers,
slow/unreliable/expensive communication links, high-volume data
transfer, extreme terrestrial environments with no link, building of
private, isolated MitM-resistant networks, highly secure isolated
air-gap computers, network censorship bypassing, and even
Reconnaissance, spying and intelligence.
