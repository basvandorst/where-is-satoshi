Technically you could ask into which fish your urine has resided, and
what the NSA, FBI, or other Cryptographic entity are doing to find
your radiactive piss.  It is a threat to national security and clearly
is an emanation which could disturb the delicate balance which holds
the threads of Our Great Nation together. You could state you have
good reason to know that information because the NOAA of the US Gov't
has determined from its Sanctuary integrated Monitoring Network that
Fukushima radiation is not far from the West Coast of California, thus
you would be interested to know where your urine is in relationship to
the transnational environmental debacle and how you are impacting
other creatures.  Thus, for example, what species, in what rivers?
What birds, in what skies?  And of course, what politicians, in what
land-based regions?  And what is being done to protect these
politicians in danger?  How many hundreds or thousands of politicians
are in danger of being contaminated due to your radioactive piss?
Please ask them in the following format:

@_subject: Net Neutrality Ruling, Internet Interprets Censorship as Damage, 
As you are probably aware, there has been a net neutrality ruling from US
courts and it essentially kills net neutrality.
Reference (this is just one of many news outlets announcing this)
This is surely no new concept to anyone on this list (the concept that we
can't rely upon laws, need to use technical solutions to bypass what
passes for government/corporation-state, etc.) but I have to say this net
neutrality calls into stark contrast what we are doing with what we could
be doing.  And by we, I mean anyone using the internet.
Many people use AT&T, or Verizon. Many people use Google and Facebook.  Or
Weibo. Or VK.  Or... you get the picture.  But rather than harp about any
one company (or licensing approach, or ruling, etc) I want to emphasize
decentralized systems beyond what many are accustomed to hearing about /
When people hear "open source" or "p2p" they might think of Ubuntu, or
Android (regarding open source OSs) or Bittorrent, or Piratebay (in terms
of things that come to mind if an ordinary human is asked what do they
thing of as an example of P2P or F2F tech).  Given the news about Bitcoin
it's a sure bet at least some people if asked on the street might also say
'Bitcoin' (or alternately, "what's P2P?" or "Software!")  So you'll get a
lot of responses and responses will vary substantially, but this is my
sense based on talking to people I know around my (rather small) town.
But how often do you hear people talking about what is needed to literally
Decentralize Everything?
Well, except for posts occasionally on lists like these, or meetings /
discussions with like-minded people, or hackerspaces, or development
discussions, the answer is Almost Never.
Anyway, this recent ruling announcement re. net neutrality (or its death)
here in the USA is just one more example of how we cannot rely upon laws,
at least in my view.  But it also made me think some more about this and
realize that if we want decentralized protocols / solutions to spread at
all, we have to do a way better job at being good advocates for them and
talking about them incessantly to everyone in a way that is easy, simple,
and makes sense to people.
As this post already exhibits I can be very wordy and windbaggish. Further evidence of that fact is presented amply in my recent post here:
As I reflect on this I think about the following.
1) I need to make something shorter that easily introduces people to open
source stuff.  Something that's even simpler than prism-break
( - an option which is so simple that anyone (at
least in primary school levels) can understand it and act on things
presented in it within less than a minute.  Look. Software. Click (one
click, two max!) to get it. Done.
2) What are some ways to Decentralize Everything? To the DNS and beyond?
Stuff that comes to mind (remember, there is no one thing, there are no
captains, there is no one solution, these are just examples of possible
partial solutions being thrown out here):
   2)a.    2)b.    2)c.    2)d. concepts like this
   2)e. Convergence for namecoin
   2)f. Convergence (a different one)    2)g. Tack.io - for pinning (it's my understading that moxie0 prefers
this direction, but I haven't been tracking it closely enough to say
what is going on with it right now)  -->       2)g.1. See also the Tack internet draft(!) at      2)g.2. See also reference TACK implementations As I read through this, and similar stuff, I think to myself, something
about this needs to be broadcast in a way that it is so easy to do, so
simple to accept, that it meets the "everybody sees it (or it's in the
news) and they click and download it"
I know it's never really that simple. But I am throwing this out there
because even more censorship is coming.  And there are no captains, and we
do need to decentralize everything. We must get A Lot more people on board
with decentralization, open source, and as close to p2p as possible, we
need to make it so easy to defeat censorship of anything that those who
propose allowing it to happen will just throw up their hands in
frustration. So the question (one of many!) is how to present this in a
way that makes sense to a lot of people.
A lot more than currently.
OK I am done for now.

This is surely no new concept to anyone on this list (the concept that we
can't rely upon laws, need to use technical solutions to bypass what
passes for government/corporation-state, etc.) but I have to say this net
neutrality calls into stark contrast what we are doing with what we could
be doing.  And by we, I mean anyone using the internet.
Many people use AT&T, or Verizon. Many people use Google and Facebook.  Or
Weibo. Or VK.  Or... you get the picture.  But rather than harp about any
one company (or licensing approach, or ruling, etc) I want to emphasize
decentralized systems beyond what many are accustomed to hearing about /
When people hear "open source" or "p2p" they might think of Ubuntu, or
Android (regarding open source OSs) or Bittorrent, or Piratebay (in terms
of things that come to mind if an ordinary human is asked what do they
thing of as an example of P2P or F2F tech).  Given the news about Bitcoin
it's a sure bet at least some people if asked on the street might also say
'Bitcoin' (or alternately, "what's P2P?" or "Software!")  So you'll get a
lot of responses and responses will vary substantially, but this is my
sense based on talking to people I know around my (rather small) town.
But how often do you hear people talking about what is needed to literally
Decentralize Everything?
Well, except for posts occasionally on lists like these, or meetings /
discussions with like-minded people, or hackerspaces, or development
discussions, the answer is Almost Never.
Anyway, this recent ruling announcement re. net neutrality (or its death)
here in the USA is just one more example of how we cannot rely upon laws,
at least in my view.  But it also made me think some more about this and
realize that if we want decentralized protocols / solutions to spread at
all, we have to do a way better job at being good advocates for them and
talking about them incessantly to everyone in a way that is easy, simple,
and makes sense to people.
As this post already exhibits I can be very wordy and windbaggish. Further evidence of that fact is presented amply in my recent post here:
As I reflect on this I think about the following.
1) I need to make something shorter that easily introduces people to open
source stuff.  Something that's even simpler than prism-break
( - an option which is so simple that anyone (at
least in primary school levels) can understand it and act on things
presented in it within less than a minute.  Look. Software. Click (one
click, two max!) to get it. Done.
2) What are some ways to Decentralize Everything? To the DNS and beyond?
Stuff that comes to mind (remember, there is no one thing, there are no
captains, there is no one solution, these are just examples of possible
partial solutions being thrown out here):
   2)a.    2)b.    2)c.    2)d. concepts like this
   2)e. Convergence for namecoin
   2)f. Convergence (a different one)    2)g. Tack.io - for pinning (it's my understading that moxie0 prefers
this direction, but I haven't been tracking it closely enough to say
what is going on with it right now)  -->       2)g.1. See also the Tack internet draft(!) at      2)g.2. See also reference TACK implementations As I read through this, and similar stuff, I think to myself, something
about this needs to be broadcast in a way that it is so easy to do, so
simple to accept, that it meets the "everybody sees it (or it's in the
news) and they click and download it"
I know it's never really that simple. But I am throwing this out there
because even more censorship is coming.  And there are no captains, and we
do need to decentralize everything. We must get A Lot more people on board
with decentralization, open source, and as close to p2p as possible, we
need to make it so easy to defeat censorship of anything that those who
propose allowing it to happen will just throw up their hands in
frustration. So the question (one of many!) is how to present this in a
way that makes sense to a lot of people.
A lot more than currently.
OK I am done for now.

@_subject: BlackHat2014: Deanonymize Tor for $3000 
This sort of conversation has been going on for at least a year.  I don't
feel as though it's fresh or new.
Mid-June of 2014 I responded to this same sort of thing when it was
mentioned with respect to possible effects on Darkwallet on another list
that I'm on.
This is more or less the substance of my response, I've copied it here:
Technically, what the attack really will do is unmask certain IPs and
ISPs, bitcoin isn't anonymous, hence, darkwallet, bytecoin, zerocash, etc.
 The question becomes is darkwallet and / or anyone using stealth a-la
 identifiable (or at least is either their
client identifiable even if other information may not be) through said
attacks as described at:
In this article, partially what is described is the following:
"the attack requires establishing 1008 connections and sending a few
MBytes in data.  This can be repeated for all Bitcoin servers, thus
prohibiting all Tor connections for 24 hours at the cost of a million
connections and less than 1 GByte of trac."
The reference to "servers" is presumably indicating servers which are
running Tor and through which something of the Bitcoin network is also
transiting through or about.  It seems as though if someone wanted to they
could target personal computers or servers, although the likelihood of
finding much useful information is unlikely, unless someone already knows
something about who they are going after and is interested in additional,
related information.  This was covered in a previous study, here:
See originally posted content which appeared _before_ fincrypto14 at:
"The goal of the Clusterizer
is to nd groups of addresses that belong to
the same user. It incrementally reads the blockchain DB and
generates-updates clusters of addresses using two heuristics, detailed in
3.2. The first heuristic exploits transactions with multiple inputs, while
the second leverages the concept
of \change" in transactions"
(from the BitIodine paper)
And so on and so forth.  Standard clustering and correlation methods infer
usernames associated with addresses.  Etc.
(My suggestion upon thinking about this further was to suggest that
Darkwallet development collaborate closely with Tor developers and the
Zerocash developers on this issue to find logical solutions.  It seemed to
be an issue but not one that is insurmountable.  Further, it seemed to me
that what would be key to the attack referenced in the coindesk article is
the following:)
"Whenever a peer receives a malformed
message, it increases the penalty score of the IP address
from which the message came (if a client uses Tor, than the
message will obviously come from on of the Tor exit nodes).
When this score exceeds 100, the sender's IP is banned for 24
Knowing this and other things about the attack, solutions can be crafted
to make such attacks more difficult, not just adding "random delays after
transactions" as the paper's authors suggested, assuming DW collaboration
with Tor developers and perhaps use of zero knowledge proofs.  See also

simon pelle
Flattr once accepted bitcoin, but their process for adding it was so
ridiculous and arcane that I abandoned trying.  I was once sent an e-mail
by one of the Flattr group convincing me that they had integrated bitcoin
into their system, it was nearly impossible to find when it was present
and their chosen implementation / location of links, buttons, and other
wizardry that was supposed to take you there was basically their elaborate
way of trying to mask that they had ever offered support for bitcoin.
Flattr is a joke.  Also, the notion that their use of decentralized
virtual currency systems cannot be justified economically (while they leap
into the embracy of KYC "compliance") is just basically statism on
steroids.  Total fail.
Next they'll be explaining that due to the implementation of TISA they
will "be forced" to obtain users' birth identities from banks around the
world prior to doing business with anyone.
In all seriousness, I think Flattr makes the argument in favor of moving
completely away from web-based services and systems, including banks that
use anything that connects to the customer through a website, for example.
But basically, fuck Flattr.  I am done.

the place where you are slamming the hammer down.  As Odinn, I have been
compelled to remind Odinson of this from time to time.
Here are some tidbits which may be relevant to the Tor-as-tool discussion
and what to be aware of:
(Note: This clear warning about some issues with certain aspects of use of
Tor is from the Tor Project itself. They are right to provide cautionary
information so that users of the project do not inadvertently harm
themselves with the tools provided.)
(The following is a guide which may be helpful on issues both related to
Tor as well as to other tools, which suggests use of SOCKS4A)
Have fun out there.  And be careful with the hammer.

Apart from the stuff mentioned on the bitcointalk post, if you know anyone

better video (something short for youtube) to encapsulate the idea that

DEFCON On The Mat
(A submittal in response to the DEFCON 22 Call for Papers)
• Presenter Information:  I am an entity, floating about.
• Presentation Information:  This is a challenge, mostly directed to the
DEFCON 22 organizers, to engage in sparring matches, one on one, with each
other, and with me, should I decide to attend.  Each match will be
refereed by someone (whoever is willing and able to call a beginning and
end to the matches and who will spend time on the mat along with two
opponents).  Each participant must begin and end each match with a bow to
their opponent.  Respect is the keyword.
• Scheduling Information:  Whenever you are up for it.
• Equipment requirements:  Your fists, feet, and sparring gear (don't
forget a protective crotch cup).  Also, bring protective headgear and a
mouthpiece.  Forearm guards, leg guards, and chest gear highly advisable. Booties and soft gloves are ok, but frowned upon.  Make up your own mind,
but protect your head and your middle bits.  If you have interlocking foam
squares (portable mat components), such as a bunch of SoftTiles, bring
them and help make a mat.  Don't wait for someone else to do it, just do
• Speaker Bio(s):  Who said I would be speaking?  You want to speak to me,
meet me on the mat.
• Abstract:  Matches begin when random referee (whoever wants to stand in
the mat area) says "Start!" or "Begin!" or "Shi-jak!" 시작
• Outline:  Try not to bleed too much.  See detailed outline in lower
portion of this submittal.
• Supporting Files: Look around. See papers scattered on floor.
• Submission Agreements:  You agree that if you are put in a submission
hold that you will agree to never ask for submission agreements again.

Presentation Information
Presentation Title:  DEFCON On The Mat
Is there a demonstration? Yes.
Are you releasing a new tool? Please.
Are you releasing a new exploit? That depends on what happens to you
during the match.
Is there audience participation? Audience not participating in matches or
persons who come without required gear must remain outside of match area.
Length of presentation? Could be an hour. Could be longer.  Up to you.

Has this presentation been given or accepted to any other venue or
conference? No.
Is your ability or willingness to speak predicated on your talk being

Is there a specific day or time by which you must present?  No.
Equipment needs & special requests:
-All the wireless internet I need and desire
-Some kind of technically competent helper human to help me connect my
Palm-powered Tungsten T to the Internet.  It has Palm OS 5, a TI OMAP 144
MHz processor, and bluetooth, so maybe you can make it work.
-Drinks, such as vodka and also water, if you have it.  It must be clean
water, though.
-Some kind of good food that is not rotten.  Pears and bananas are nice. Hamburgers are good.
-Please do not claim that someone stole your forearm guards or demand to
use someone else's chest piece.  You are responsible for your own gear. No
-Take your hits without crying out in pain, it doesn't look well to be
moaning and groaning when you have previously agreed to a match and have
entered upon the mat willingly.
-Thoughtful conversation
-If I decide to come, you will pay for all my goodies and not attempt to
charge me anything for attending.  Failure to comply with this special
request will result in chaos
Will you require more than 1 LCD projector feed? No.
Will you require a white board? No
Are there any other special equipment needs that you will require?
If you have SoftTiles that are interlocking please bring them, they make
nice mat material.
I would like you to bring some concrete blocks.  If you have them lying
around or can get them easily, maybe 8 or 10 of them.  However, they need
to be the kind without rebar in them as they will probably all get broken
in a demonstration.  Also bring pencils or chopsticks so we can put those
between the blocks while the blocks are waiting to be broken.  Best blocks
are 4" standard concrete blocks or 8" standard concrete blocks.  Thank you
Also, I like hamburgers.
Speaker Bio(s):
I am a fellow human.  As an entity, floating about, I am happy to be here
with you and share your experiences, fantasies, delusions, etc.  Thank
you.  Blessings.
Meh.  Get to the mat.
Detailed Outline:
1) Get your gear on
2) Line up in orderly way and proceed to mat
3) When it is your turn to go, step onto the mat, bow to your opponent,
and wait for the referee to say "Start!" or "Begin!" or "Shi-ha" or
something that indicates the match has begun.
4) Fight.
5) The referee (random participant who decides to ref) will time the
match, at most two rounds of a minute each.  At end of first round you get
a break of about 30 seconds.  Referee decides when break begins and ends.
6) Referee notes second round is over.  It is not necessary for referee to
say whether or not someone has "won."  It is about respect.
7) Both match participants bow to each other, shake hands, and leave the mat.

@_subject: [tor-talk] Facebook brute forcing hidden services 
Hash: SHA512
I agree.
I tried out the FB Tor hidden service.  I was censored / banned from
accessing FB at all, and FB demanded a "government ID" in order to
take off the ban ~ I refused to do so.  (not that I wanted to use it,
but after a while I was curious what some distant family and friends
were doing in terms of their activity on FB).
The Tor hidden service allowed me to get far enough into the login
process that I was able to squeeze out a 2FA and complete login,
something I could not do before due to the ban.  It's clear that part
of FB censorship involves discrimination against persons they disagree
with based in part on IP addresses.
FB's centralized platform and ubiquitous selling of people's data is
problematic enough, and their discrimination against people who
identify differently (or who engage in trans-identical expression) is
telling.  It's not a service I want to use, but I've explored in the
past chatting with those who use it, by way of use of the Empathy
program.  (FB is now blocking many users of Empathy as well, btw)
Exactly ~ none of this should be required.  As wide as its use is, FB
should be viewed as a doomed / dying platform based on its extractive
and oppressive model.  Of note, however:
- - At least 72 percent of online adults use social media, with around
18 percent using twitter, based on 2013 numbers
- - 42% of online adults use multiple social networking sites, but
Facebook remains a platform of choice, based on 2013 numbers
- - A 2014 review of social media marketing indicates that Facebook is
the single biggest social media platform used by marketers (another
reason not to use it, but also makes it obvious that a lot of people
currently find it profitable to use)
These findings seem to indicate that when people are designing
applications that are oriented on the peer-to-peer, decentralized
model, in order to be successful, the applications should be very
simple to use, and provide for ample opportunity for engagement, if
they hope to challenge the well-established centralized models.  As an
example, I've suggested to OpenBazaar team (which is about to release
a new beta version) that they work at making the application "lighter"
as well as easier and friendlier to use in a mobile version, so that
it would have the feel of depop.com
Coupling interesting, easy to access listings and posts tailored for
mobile users with easy-to-use commmunication that has broad appeal is
a goal that should be added (or at least, emphasized a lot more) in
p2p development.
Agreed. And the more one posts content to FB as a platform, the more
you give them to mine and profit from.  It should be avoided.

Well, not trying to be blunt about it, but maybe the reason why Moxie
decided to build apps for Android, is because Android tipped over 80
percent market share before even 2014, and who wouldn't want to try to
provide good privacy for that large of a userbase?  or maybe it is
some other reason, maybe you could ask Moxie, who I've copied on this.
 But with that said, with that many users, good apps that provide
people with choices as to how to protect their information are necessary.
By the way, I use RedPhone and TextSecure, and I recommend them to
others. I'm aware of the issues that have arisen in connection with
analyses of TextSecure and CyanogenMod (and the issues that people
raise with Android), but I still think that RedPhone and TextSecure
are some of the best things out there particularly when compared to
many other similar apps on the market.
Really these kind of things (Google Play's censorship of Adblockplus
and disconnectme in the past, as examples, and Google pulling RedPhone
off Play, more recently) make it clear though that you can't have
Google as your friend for long and if you're going to put an app out
it should be downloadable from your project site, downloadable from
github, and accessible (for mobile apps / droid) via
  as well.
Don't you dare tell me people should go get an iPhone (yes, Signal is

It wasn't necessary to have newly disclosed NSA documents referred to in the article to figure out and report on that there are ""contractual relationships" between the NSA and U.S. companies, as well as the fact that the NSA has "under cover" spies working at or with some U.S. companies."
The reason why it wasn't necessary?  Because it's been well established for years and it is not a secret that this is the case.  TAREX, undercover agents, and of course, "corporate parters" referred to in the Intercept overview of the documents cited, can all claim (if pressed) that they are merely following the "voluntary DIB" ~ the DoD Defense Industrial Base Voluntary Cyber Security and Information Assurance rule, a.k.a. DOD-2009-OS-0183-0001 (CFR: 32 CFR Part 236; Federal Register Number: 2012-10651).
For details, See:  (from 5/11/2012!!!)
Some of the same language of the "administrative rule" referred to in the privacysos article, was later adopted by Congress, as H.Amdt.44 to H.R.624 (Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act) which passed the House in 2013, but was not enacted as there was too much opposition to allow it to move onto and pass the Senate.  Independent of Congress's legislative process, the administrative rule was finalized and continues to be used today as a part of the basis for the corporation-state's All of the corporation-state crimes against humanity are generally committed in full public view.

I would add to that, even though it won't change the behavior of those
engaging in surveillance, it wouldn't hurt to post a notice somewhere
on the server stating that the managers of the server / service do not
consent to warrantless searches, or something to that effect. This is
similar to the "door notice" and "safe notice" that CALGUNS and Michel
& Associates (a law firm) published to counter APPS seizures in CA,
USA. (Not many people use them, but if you're prone to receiving
visits from LEOs, it's at the very least something you should discuss
with your lawyer.) Suppose you have a "door notice" up installed as a
file somewhere on your servers - basically saying "Go Away! We don't
consent to warrantless searches" or something like that... if it then
turns out that someone has been poking into your servers you will then
be able to say "There was a warning posted...You were warned that you
shouldn't do that," and proceed to either disclose what they've done
or even (if you really want to try to use the law as a blunt
instrument, not that I recommend that, I really don't, but here it is)
either issue cease and desist (what Mozilla did on at least one
occasion) or, _prosecute_ the agents (under the DoD's voluntary DIB,
the agents could be corporate or persons directly in governmental
employ) using civil legal actions:
Please note:
1) Law isn't a solution to stop malware and surveillance, though I
have in the past suggested how people could use it.
2) Nothing I post here can be construed as legal advice.  If you are
contemplating doing anything that would involve the use of law in any
way shape or form, go get a lawyer.
3) Cryptoanarchy, I think, will have a much bigger impact than people

violence, and coercion altogether, will thus fade as time goes on, IMHO.

@_subject: NSA Co-Chairs of Crypto Forum Research Group, Legitimacy of WebCrypto 
Hash: SHA512
For those of you on this list who have been watching the progress of
things relating to the W3C coordinated process for the WebCrypto API,
you know that a lot of work and thought has gone into this and it is
an impressive collaboration.
But with the IETF CFRG (Crypto Forum Research Group) still being
co-chaired by an agent of the NSA (n1), anything that passes through
that organization must be questioned at this time.  (In the unlikely
event that the CFRG page is censored after this message is sent, I've
included the names and e-mail addresses of the current co-chairs as
part of this message as they currently appear on the CFRG's site,
where their names and e-mail addresses have been sitting in full
public view for a very long time (n2)).
As some of you already know, people within the Crypto Forum Research
Group have tried (so far unsuccessfully) since last year (n1, n2, n3)
to remove the NSA Co-chair.  It should not matter who the person is,
but the issue is that having anyone who is in the employ of or
affiliated with the NSA chair (or co-chair) a research group whose
purpose it is to advise all IETF Working Groups, is highly problematic
for reasons which now should be obvious to anyone reading this message.
Currently the WebCrypto API is approaching its last call ~ it's in a
process of being finalized.  For those who are not sure what the
WebCrypto API is, it's one of those things that is designed to
basically help make ordinary webpages that you see work, and includes
the definition of cryptographic primitives that make your internet go.
 That's a terrible description actually, but if you want a better or
more comprehensive description of WebCrypto API in plain English,
consider reading poulpita's blog (n4).  It's also described at a W3C
page as a "JavaScript API for performing basic cryptographic
operations in web applications, such as hashing, signature generation
and verification, and encryption and decryption. Additionally, it
describes an API for applications to generate and/or manage the keying
material necessary to perform these operations. Uses for this API
range from user or service authentication, document or code signing,
and the confidentiality and integrity of communications." (n5)
But the WebCrypto API Doc process and, and indeed the legitimacy of
the WebCrypto API itself, should be questioned and doubted, for the
WebCrypto group has recently held off on including the widely-used
curve25519 within NamedCurve dictionaries or as part of its
extensibility and errata process, until the (NSA co-chaired) Crypto
Forum Research Group gives W3C the go-ahead.   For further information
and confirmation on this, see (n6) below.
If you are concerned about this, check out the message thread
discussing attempts to remove the NSA co-chair (n3) and consider
posting to the CFRG list (n7) about it once you subscribe.
NSA affiliated persons need to be removed from groups that influence
the direction of the entire web. I hope those who receive this message
will organize to help make that happen.

John, for some reason your name reminds me of someone who I think was

I think this came up in a thread on twitter some while back actually...
(That twitter thread was from a discussion in mid-2013[!] which
referenced MainCore and also (different than MainCore) a 'list of

At the risk of being repetitive, I simply wish to ask the following to
whoever is reading this thread, be it random cypherpunks list
subscribers that are just trying to clear out their e-mail on the
weekend, John Young, Glenn Greenwald, or anyone who knows something
that I do not (and that's quite a lot):
1) Who might have access to a list known as Main Core?  This is such
an old story that it would seem that some kind of list would now be
available, but I haven't found it. Has it ever been leaked, FOIA'd,
successfully released in partially redacted form in some other
mechanism, or made searchable somewhere?
[[ Main Core notes / background:  Salon reported on Main Core in July
of 2008 with an article by Tim Shorrock. Apparently, William Hamilton,
a former NSA intelligence officer who left the agency in the 1970s,
had heard of Main Core at some point in 1992, according to the Salon
article. Hamilton, who (was then, and still is) president of Inslaw
Inc., a computer services firm that includes clients in government,
indicated that the Bush administration�s domestic surveillance
operations used Main Core - it is not known if it is still used today
in 2014.  Main Core was first widely reported on in May 2008 by
Christopher Ketcham and in July 2008 by Tim Shorrock, which included
in July of 2008 an interview by Amy Goodman of Tim Shorrock.  However,
I am unaware of any release of names, e-mails, etc. which might be on
this list, and it seemed kind of obvious that those who were reporting
on it probably had never seen the Main Core list.  This may involve
use of PROMIS software, and according to Adm. Dan Murphy (a former
military advisor to Elliot Richardson who later served under President
George H.W. Bush as deputy director of the CIA, who 'died' shortly
after his meeting in 2001 with William Hamilton), did not specifically
mention Main Core. But he informed Hamilton that the NSA�s use of
PROMIS involved something �so seriously wrong that money alone cannot
cure the problem.� ]]
2) What kind of process (if any) exists for myself or anyone else to
get access to this 'list of targets' which Greenwald referred to some
long time ago?
[[ For clarification, I think that this 'list of targets' which I
referred to in my prior message on this thread, and the list of
targets which I am inquiring about now, is the �FISA recap�
spreadsheet containing email addresses, with a �Collection Status�
column and �Case Notation� codes beginning with the prefix �XX.SQF�
directly followed by a number ]]
A redacted version is shown here (which is not searchable):
3) Are there any indications that Main Core list might have just been
merged into another list (such as the 'FISA Recap' or some other such
thing)?  Any news story which provided some kind of statements about
merging of lists, lists being glommed together and used by DHS, etc.?
4) Would it be necessary for me to peruse the entire (in the case of
the  FISA Recap / list of targets) source document of over 7,000 names
or e-mail addresses?  I hope not.  I am interested in some kind of
item that would allow me to search to find out if my name and / or the
names or e-mail addresses of those I am familiar with is in lists such
as MainCore and the FISA Recap (which by now is undoubtedly rather
dated, but I would like to find out anyway).
By the way, I am not the only one interested in being able to search
that list:
5) For reference:  When vulnerabilities come out that affect millions
of people in the internet world, and when those turn into situations
that result in people's e-mails being divulged somehow, usually there
is someone who is quick to provide a website to make this whole
process searchable by e-mail address so you can find out if you are
affected --
like this excellent site:
Just by way of suggestion, I know haveibeenpwned is actually for the
purposes of checking if you have an account that has been compromised
in a data breach in the past (and yes I've used it to check all my
e-mail addresses, and I took appropriate action to protect myself
after the Forbes hack/breach...), but  I see no reason why that same
site (or another site using the same searchable model) should not
present the e-mail addresses of who ended up on Main Core and / or the
'FISA Recap' and reveal if your e-mail address is on there, So That
You Know.  If you know your e-mail address, you can check, and if you
are one of the over 7,000 individuals in the FISA Recap list, a little
thing should notify you of that when you use a search page, just like
it does in haveibeenpwned.  This should have already been made
available long ago (seriously, I hope someone from First Look is
reading this).
Also, if I am being really foolish and if such a page already exists
that would allow me to search for my e-mail address to find if it is
in a FISA Recap, please by all means enlighten me as to the URL (with
protocol identifier as http or https please!) of that page, so I can
go search.

Thanks for sharing this. My sense is that Main Core existed but was
never leaked (and certainly couldn't be obtained via FOIA) ~ some
figures state that it had around 8 million names, and that was well
before the most recent administration ~ so assuming something like it
is still in use, and based on the source material that has been
released to date, it would seem that everyone and their dogs, cats and
guinea pigs are on some list or another.
In a strange and unlikely occurrence, I recall that recently there was
a court case of some kind where someone was able to convince a court
to tell the TSA that they had to disclose if someone was on a no-fly
list.  I can't remember the name of the case but it was the first time
I'd seen that happen.  Not that I am advocating use of law and the
force associated with it to solve vast societal problems, but
apparently someone had some luck there against all odds.
Well, now I am thinking I should just take a link to my posted
request, as John Y. seemed to suggest and send it through socmedia to
Firstlook / Greenwald and see if I get a reply.
Cheers all

@_subject: [tor-talk] Bitcoin over Tor =?UTF-8?B?aXNu4oCZdCBhIGdvb2QgaWQ=?= 
Hash: SHA512
My feelings on this are as follows:
Most users of bitcoin who also use Tor can be readily deanonymized as
it exists today:
Bitcoin users should (at least) consider not using Tor, and/or taking
additional privacy measures, for some other reasons that have been
covered in a different paper:
Most users of bitcoin are not capable of preventing any identities
they use from being correlated with their bitcoin use.  This was
described at FinCrypto14 by authors of BitIodine:
The bitcoin protocol fingerprint is obvious even over encrypted Tor.
Yet, for most people, the only way they have of masking their location
while using bitcoin, is to use Tor with it.  This puts users in a
terrible bind, because as the authors of the papers above have clearly
ascertained, as bitcoin exists today, and as Tor currently exists, the
option is definitely not ideal.
Should bitcoin protocol be "encrypted on the wire?"  Sure.  But this
does not address the deficiencies and problems with the protocol as it
exists presently.  There is no option for anonymity (in bitcoin), and
the best advice would be to move all bitcoin resources away from web
wallets and bitcoin web-based services (none of which implement
complete zero knowledge protocols, and all of which know quite a bit
about their users).  Move your resources away from any web-based
wallets and any web-based exchanges, and move them to wallets such as
Electrum (which will soon have support for stealth, and can be
enhanced with a plugin mixer), or to Armory (which includes multisig
support), and then mix them and move them again back to yourself until
your coins' 'path' and history is at least somewhat obscured.
"Abandon hope, all ye who enter into web-based wallets and exchanges"
TISA, FATCA, and FinCen are examples of what we knew would happen (yet
even with this understanding, the developers of bitcoin based
businesses stuck their heads in the sand and huddled in support of
regulatory elements which are part of the Windhover proposals to
regulate decentralized identity, even when the Russian Federation came
out with its ban proposals - nor did they take any efforts to protect
the users through full zero knowledge configuration(s) of their
servers).  Basically, web-based businesses had the time and
opportunity to pursue server design that would keep them from knowing
anything about their users, but they did not do it as the convenience
of getting customers onboard took a higher priority than privacy or
anonymity considerations. Zerocash (an improvement over the original
zerocoin proposals, zerocash is designed [unlike bitcoin] to provide
strong anonymity at the core of its functionality), would treat
bitcoin and other currencies as 'base coins.'  Thus you could (once
zerocash is available) migrate from bitcoin to zerocash and thus
anonymize any further activity, or not, entirely at your option.
Until Zerocash is released (anticipated to occur sometime close to the
end of 2014, or possibly early 2015), the wisest course of action
might be to convert (though not on the web based exchanges, as you
should now be using decentralized exchanges) a substantial portion (if
not all) of one's bitcoin into cryptosystems which are actually
designed to allow user-specified anonymity (and which have had
favorable review from bitcoin developers).  One such example is
bytecoin.org - a.k.a. BCN, not to be mistaken for the bitcoin knockoff
also known as bytecoin.
Some resources to help those who are examining this more in detail:
On Decentralized Exchange systems (not web-based)
On Bytecoin (bytecoin.org / BCN), sx, OpenBazaar, Zerocash, and
decentralizing / anonymizing finance generally

At the risk of being repetitive, I simply wish to ask the following to
whoever is reading this thread, be it random cypherpunks list
subscribers that are just trying to clear out their e-mail on the
weekend, John Young, Glenn Greenwald, or anyone who knows something
that I do not (and that's quite a lot):
1) Who might have access to a list known as Main Core?  This is such
an old story that it would seem that some kind of list would now be
available, but I haven't found it. Has it ever been leaked, FOIA'd,
successfully released in partially redacted form in some other
mechanism, or made searchable somewhere?
[[ Main Core notes / background:  Salon reported on Main Core in July
of 2008 with an article by Tim Shorrock. Apparently, William Hamilton,
a former NSA intelligence officer who left the agency in the 1970s,
had heard of Main Core at some point in 1992, according to the Salon
article. Hamilton, who (was then, and still is) president of Inslaw
Inc., a computer services firm that includes clients in government,
indicated that the Bush administration�s domestic surveillance
operations used Main Core - it is not known if it is still used today
in 2014.  Main Core was first widely reported on in May 2008 by
Christopher Ketcham and in July 2008 by Tim Shorrock, which included
in July of 2008 an interview by Amy Goodman of Tim Shorrock.  However,
I am unaware of any release of names, e-mails, etc. which might be on
this list, and it seemed kind of obvious that those who were reporting
on it probably had never seen the Main Core list.  This may involve
use of PROMIS software, and according to Adm. Dan Murphy (a former
military advisor to Elliot Richardson who later served under President
George H.W. Bush as deputy director of the CIA, who 'died' shortly
after his meeting in 2001 with William Hamilton), did not specifically
mention Main Core. But he informed Hamilton that the NSA�s use of
PROMIS involved something �so seriously wrong that money alone cannot
cure the problem.� ]]
2) What kind of process (if any) exists for myself or anyone else to
get access to this 'list of targets' which Greenwald referred to some
long time ago?
[[ For clarification, I think that this 'list of targets' which I
referred to in my prior message on this thread, and the list of
targets which I am inquiring about now, is the �FISA recap�
spreadsheet containing email addresses, with a �Collection Status�
column and �Case Notation� codes beginning with the prefix �XX.SQF�
directly followed by a number ]]
A redacted version is shown here (which is not searchable):
3) Are there any indications that Main Core list might have just been
merged into another list (such as the 'FISA Recap' or some other such
thing)?  Any news story which provided some kind of statements about
merging of lists, lists being glommed together and used by DHS, etc.?
4) Would it be necessary for me to peruse the entire (in the case of
the  FISA Recap / list of targets) source document of over 7,000 names
or e-mail addresses?  I hope not.  I am interested in some kind of
item that would allow me to search to find out if my name and / or the
names or e-mail addresses of those I am familiar with is in lists such
as MainCore and the FISA Recap (which by now is undoubtedly rather
dated, but I would like to find out anyway).
By the way, I am not the only one interested in being able to search
that list:
5) For reference:  When vulnerabilities come out that affect millions
of people in the internet world, and when those turn into situations
that result in people's e-mails being divulged somehow, usually there
is someone who is quick to provide a website to make this whole
process searchable by e-mail address so you can find out if you are
affected --
like this excellent site:
Just by way of suggestion, I know haveibeenpwned is actually for the
purposes of checking if you have an account that has been compromised
in a data breach in the past (and yes I've used it to check all my
e-mail addresses, and I took appropriate action to protect myself
after the Forbes hack/breach...), but  I see no reason why that same
site (or another site using the same searchable model) should not
present the e-mail addresses of who ended up on Main Core and / or the
'FISA Recap' and reveal if your e-mail address is on there, So That
You Know.  If you know your e-mail address, you can check, and if you
are one of the over 7,000 individuals in the FISA Recap list, a little
thing should notify you of that when you use a search page, just like
it does in haveibeenpwned.  This should have already been made
available long ago (seriously, I hope someone from First Look is
reading this).
Also, if I am being really foolish and if such a page already exists
that would allow me to search for my e-mail address to find if it is
in a FISA Recap, please by all means enlighten me as to the URL (with
protocol identifier as http or https please!) of that page, so I can
go search.

Thanks for sharing this. My sense is that Main Core existed but was
never leaked (and certainly couldn't be obtained via FOIA) ~ some
figures state that it had around 8 million names, and that was well
before the most recent administration ~ so assuming something like it
is still in use, and based on the source material that has been
released to date, it would seem that everyone and their dogs, cats and
guinea pigs are on some list or another.
In a strange and unlikely occurrence, I recall that recently there was
a court case of some kind where someone was able to convince a court
to tell the TSA that they had to disclose if someone was on a no-fly
list.  I can't remember the name of the case but it was the first time
I'd seen that happen.  Not that I am advocating use of law and the
force associated with it to solve vast societal problems, but
apparently someone had some luck there against all odds.
Well, now I am thinking I should just take a link to my posted
request, as John Y. seemed to suggest and send it through socmedia to
Firstlook / Greenwald and see if I get a reply.

Hash: SHA512
My feelings on this are as follows:
Most users of bitcoin who also use Tor can be readily deanonymized as
it exists today:
Bitcoin users should (at least) consider not using Tor, and/or taking
additional privacy measures, for some other reasons that have been
covered in a different paper:
Most users of bitcoin are not capable of preventing any identities
they use from being correlated with their bitcoin use.  This was
described at FinCrypto14 by authors of BitIodine:
The bitcoin protocol fingerprint is obvious even over encrypted Tor.
Yet, for most people, the only way they have of masking their location
while using bitcoin, is to use Tor with it.  This puts users in a
terrible bind, because as the authors of the papers above have clearly
ascertained, as bitcoin exists today, and as Tor currently exists, the
option is definitely not ideal.
Should bitcoin protocol be "encrypted on the wire?"  Sure.  But this
does not address the deficiencies and problems with the protocol as it
exists presently.  There is no option for anonymity (in bitcoin), and
the best advice would be to move all bitcoin resources away from web
wallets and bitcoin web-based services (none of which implement
complete zero knowledge protocols, and all of which know quite a bit
about their users).  Move your resources away from any web-based
wallets and any web-based exchanges, and move them to wallets such as
Electrum (which will soon have support for stealth, and can be
enhanced with a plugin mixer), or to Armory (which includes multisig
support), and then mix them and move them again back to yourself until
your coins' 'path' and history is at least somewhat obscured.
"Abandon hope, all ye who enter into web-based wallets and exchanges"
TISA, FATCA, and FinCen are examples of what we knew would happen (yet
even with this understanding, the developers of bitcoin based
businesses stuck their heads in the sand and huddled in support of
regulatory elements which are part of the Windhover proposals to
regulate decentralized identity, even when the Russian Federation came
out with its ban proposals - nor did they take any efforts to protect
the users through full zero knowledge configuration(s) of their
servers).  Basically, web-based businesses had the time and
opportunity to pursue server design that would keep them from knowing
anything about their users, but they did not do it as the convenience
of getting customers onboard took a higher priority than privacy or
anonymity considerations. Zerocash (an improvement over the original
zerocoin proposals, zerocash is designed [unlike bitcoin] to provide
strong anonymity at the core of its functionality), would treat
bitcoin and other currencies as 'base coins.'  Thus you could (once
zerocash is available) migrate from bitcoin to zerocash and thus
anonymize any further activity, or not, entirely at your option.
Until Zerocash is released (anticipated to occur sometime close to the
end of 2014, or possibly early 2015), the wisest course of action
might be to convert (though not on the web based exchanges, as you
should now be using decentralized exchanges) a substantial portion (if
not all) of one's bitcoin into cryptosystems which are actually
designed to allow user-specified anonymity (and which have had
favorable review from bitcoin developers).  One such example is
bytecoin.org - a.k.a. BCN, not to be mistaken for the bitcoin knockoff
also known as bytecoin.

@_subject: Corporate undercover nation-state agents 
This ProPublica story is one of the few by ProPublica that is actually very silly and not well researched.  It wasn't necessary to have newly disclosed NSA documents referred to in the article to figure out and report on that there are ""contractual relationships" between the NSA and U.S. companies, as well as the fact that the NSA has "under cover" spies working at or with some U.S. companies."
The reason why it wasn't necessary?  Because it's been well established for years and it is not a secret that this is the case.  TAREX, undercover agents, and of course, "corporate parters" referred to in the Intercept overview of the documents cited, can all claim (if pressed) that they are merely following the "voluntary DIB" ~ the DoD Defense Industrial Base Voluntary Cyber Security and Information Assurance rule, a.k.a. DOD-2009-OS-0183-0001 (CFR: 32 CFR Part 236; Federal Register Number: 2012-10651).
For details, See:  (from 5/11/2012!!!)
Some of the same language of the "administrative rule" referred to in the privacysos article, was later adopted by Congress, as H.Amdt.44 to H.R.624 (Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act) which passed the House in 2013, but was not enacted as there was too much opposition to allow it to move onto and pass the Senate.  Independent of Congress's legislative process, the administrative rule was finalized and continues to be used today as a part of the basis for the corporation-state's All of the corporation-state crimes against humanity are generally committed in full public view.  They have no shame.  You can't vote them out or demand they change (though it helps to publicly oppose what they are doing ~ I appreciate TheOpenMedia's recent efforts, for example, as shown at:  In general though, to address these rampant problems in a way that really alters the funding and ultimate disposition of resources that society has (assuming we don't want all our diminishing resources thrown down the gov-hole), the only thing we can do is empower people to remove resources from this deeply flawed system as we build new ones.

I would add to that, even though it won't change the behavior of those
engaging in surveillance, it wouldn't hurt to post a notice somewhere
on the server stating that the managers of the server / service do not
consent to warrantless searches, or something to that effect. This is
similar to the "door notice" and "safe notice" that CALGUNS and Michel
& Associates (a law firm) published to counter APPS seizures in CA,
USA. (Not many people use them, but if you're prone to receiving
visits from LEOs, it's at the very least something you should discuss
with your lawyer.) Suppose you have a "door notice" up installed as a
file somewhere on your servers - basically saying "Go Away! We don't
consent to warrantless searches" or something like that... if it then
turns out that someone has been poking into your servers you will then
be able to say "There was a warning posted...You were warned that you
shouldn't do that," and proceed to either disclose what they've done
or even (if you really want to try to use the law as a blunt
instrument, not that I recommend that, I really don't, but here it is)
either issue cease and desist (what Mozilla did on at least one
occasion) or, _prosecute_ the agents (under the DoD's voluntary DIB,
the agents could be corporate or persons directly in governmental
employ) using civil legal actions:
Please note:
1) Law isn't a solution to stop malware and surveillance, though I
have in the past suggested how people could use it.
2) Nothing I post here can be construed as legal advice.  If you are
contemplating doing anything that would involve the use of law in any
way shape or form, go get a lawyer.
3) Cryptoanarchy, I think, will have a much bigger impact than people
are currently willing to admit.  The influence of those who use law,
violence, and coercion altogether, will thus fade as time goes on, IMHO.

@_subject: NSA Co-Chairs of Crypto Forum Research Group, Legitimacy of WebCrypto 
Hash: SHA512
For those of you on this list who have been watching the progress of
things relating to the W3C coordinated process for the WebCrypto API,
you know that a lot of work and thought has gone into this and it is
an impressive collaboration.
But with the IETF CFRG (Crypto Forum Research Group) still being
co-chaired by an agent of the NSA (n1), anything that passes through
that organization must be questioned at this time.  (In the unlikely
event that the CFRG page is censored after this message is sent, I've
included the names and e-mail addresses of the current co-chairs as
part of this message as they currently appear on the CFRG's site,
where their names and e-mail addresses have been sitting in full
public view for a very long time (n2)).
As some of you already know, people within the Crypto Forum Research
Group have tried (so far unsuccessfully) since last year (n1, n2, n3)
to remove the NSA Co-chair.  It should not matter who the person is,
but the issue is that having anyone who is in the employ of or
affiliated with the NSA chair (or co-chair) a research group whose
purpose it is to advise all IETF Working Groups, is highly problematic
for reasons which now should be obvious to anyone reading this message.
Currently the WebCrypto API is approaching its last call ~ it's in a
process of being finalized.  For those who are not sure what the
WebCrypto API is, it's one of those things that is designed to
basically help make ordinary webpages that you see work, and includes
the definition of cryptographic primitives that make your internet go.
 That's a terrible description actually, but if you want a better or
more comprehensive description of WebCrypto API in plain English,
consider reading poulpita's blog (n4).  It's also described at a W3C
page as a "JavaScript API for performing basic cryptographic
operations in web applications, such as hashing, signature generation
and verification, and encryption and decryption. Additionally, it
describes an API for applications to generate and/or manage the keying
material necessary to perform these operations. Uses for this API
range from user or service authentication, document or code signing,
and the confidentiality and integrity of communications." (n5)
But the WebCrypto API Doc process and, and indeed the legitimacy of
the WebCrypto API itself, should be questioned and doubted, for the
WebCrypto group has recently held off on including the widely-used
curve25519 within NamedCurve dictionaries or as part of its
extensibility and errata process, until the (NSA co-chaired) Crypto
Forum Research Group gives W3C the go-ahead.   For further information
and confirmation on this, see (n6) below.
If you are concerned about this, check out the message thread
discussing attempts to remove the NSA co-chair (n3) and consider
posting to the CFRG list (n7) about it once you subscribe.
NSA affiliated persons need to be removed from groups that influence
the direction of the entire web. I hope those who receive this message
will organize to help make that happen.
(n1) (n2) From CFRG's public webpage (n1) as of Oct. 20, 2014:  "CFRG is
chaired by Kevin Igoe (kmigoe at nsa.gov), Kenny Paterson
(kenny.paterson at rhul.ac.uk) and Alexey Melnikov
(alexey.melnikov at isode.com)."

I think this came up in a thread on twitter some while back actually...

designed to allow user-specified anonymity (and which have had
favorable review from bitcoin developers).  One such example is
bytecoin.org - a.k.a. BCN, not to be mistaken for the bitcoin knockoff
also known as bytecoin.

The coercive and violent methods that the US government and governments
like it (e.g. Russia, China, and many others) around the globe use in

The social problems inherent in unquestioning compliance with

which could be presented through decentralization of giving systems

Hash: SHA512
Five things
1) Please publish suggested guid(es) here in Russian and English for
how people should install and maintain Gnupg - gpg - seems like after
many years that program is not getting the support it needs - so here
is the fundraiser link again for it.  (Look at all the payment methods!)
Some suggestions are in English here at only the most basic level and
not dealing with any complexities, but I suggest people start talking
about standards for how to reply to lists and forums as well as how to
communicate amongst each other just one on one for example:
2) I know someone here will say "off topic" but there is nothing off
topic about having people address what needs to be addressed, like
hopefully getting more people talking about the possibilities of
learning different and better ways of strong (and hopefully easier to
use) crypto.
2.a) if you don't like seeing it here please start new thread, which
is probably a great idea.  If questions about that, please see prior
item, if that does not address the issue of OT, please see item 3 below.
3) You think this is off topic? see number 2.a above.
4) More back OT:  People will use what they want to use no matter
where they are in the world.  There are Russians using Gnupg, but it
would be not a good idea for me to say who I've observed does so.
There are Russians examining this GOST thing.  Russian Federation /
Waasenaar arrangment (a stupid idea meant to appease people who think
that gov't controls on cryptography actually have meaning or purpose)
- - involves import, export, and use.  Anyway, no matter what country
you are in, do what you want, and take care that you are not harmed in
the process, basically.  And this gets back to my push for Gnupg -
gpg.  Using that to the best of one's ability and hopefully
encouraging others to do so is going to be useful in terms of securing
communications in 2015.
Thank you and excuse the longish post.

@_author: odinn 
@_subject: John Gilmore: Cryptography list is censoring my emails 
Hash: SHA512
It's unclear to me what exactly is causing said censorship lately.
But I've seen some unusual amount of what (in my eyes) is censorship
occur across totally different lists and forums over the past few
weeks.  It's hard to say "oh that occured here, here and here!"
because your thought may be way different than mine on where that
actually occurred, so I'll just shut up on that threshold piece. (IMHO
it's when someone keeps your content from appearing or just disappears
something you've posted, in a very simplistic overview, of the list
question) However...  In each case the common thread which seemed to
actually result in censorship being initiated (wherever you might
think it was), was someone posting something (or trying to express
something) relating to crypto, identity, or anonymity related.  No
surprise there.  It also seemed to occur in the last few weeks of this
year, or more recently which was kind of odd.  I disagree with anyone
who might propose the whole "lizard theory" of censorship, as I think
that any list or forum censorship (where it does occur) has nothing
(or almost zero) to do with any lizard antics and much more to do with
underlying "earth core displacement" issues that touch on major
differences both within crypto communities themselves and also within
(probably overly) curious members of investigatory / LEO communities.
Finally, it has not escaped my attention that the recent attacks on
Tor or portions of the Tor network, could have been enough to broaden
block lists (whether this block list / spam effect bit would be
intentional or not) which would result in delivery of  information to
- -  and   (see
 - where sorbs
and barracudacentral for example might then become recipients
(inexpensively and quickly) of even larger amounts of IP addresses
than before, which could be in certain situations shown as spam
addresses, at least during the time of the brief and limited attacks
on Tor late last year.  See for example:
 and look towards bottom of
page thing.  This might have briefly caused some (Tor) users, for
example, to have had limited accessibility to some sites, in some
circumstances - even if unintentional.  I am not going to go on some
long ass rantarola on how this could or could not happen. It hurts my
back to be sitting here typing so I'll slow down and stop real soon.
Tear me to shreds on this idea if you wish, but it is entirely
possible that this could have occurred in some parts of the network(s).
As to the actual result of this process in _intentional_ censorship,
wherever and however that actually occurs:  Unacceptable.
I have also noticed that pybitmessage / bitmessage has been having
more lag issues lately esp. when the messages are being sent /
received to / from China.  This is less a problem if sent from a
"free-er" zone (e.g. Macao, Japan... the latter of which is, well...
really not freeish at all) but still... can be issues. Not sure if
anyone here has experienced same things so I've been encouraging
people to be cautious with pybitmessage / bitmessage atm and use gpg
more in 2015.  Best encryption is best thing... I truly hope gnupg -
gpg will get fully funded soon
( hey! see this! includes bitcoin as option for donation to gpg project:
  )
Then that which is is decentralized is best thing.  This is why I will
keep yammering about why we should be using truly decentralized
solutions such as... not just btc but also things like bcn, hopefully
we will see zerocash in early 2015 sometime, and openbazaar is already
working.  We have models which will work without requiring a state
model, but which don't require that we participate in the same
tiresome and violent struggles time and time again either.  T. May's
thoughts in 1992 seemed crazy to most people who would have read them
at that time.
Now they just sort of seem like a first step in whatever's next.
What's next?
Just kind of rolling this around in my brain, by the way:

I read this and I just get more confused. One I feel like this is
topic drift (but don't worry about that, I'm glad for a little drift
here) and two... what about bitcoin which is.... MIT right?  I don't
mean to drift it further... but I feel like this gets to be a circular

maybe it was on Unsystem) sometime I think early last year in which he
had some arguments I hadn't considered for different types of
unlicensing approaches.  Which again, I just hadn't considered before
he had elaborated on it at length.  In comparison the whole thing I
found at the time a bit befuddling.
This led me to ask if maybe there was just a way to release it into
domain (public domain) without the whole licensing system and
multitude of restrictions and competing licensing restrictions
(including Unlicense) coming into play, depending on the project /
projects being considered.  (Again I think we are twirling in circles

Hello Jesse,
Jesse B. Crawford:
Here, then. Why would it necessarily depend on jurisdiction?  Isn't
the jurisdiction primarily something that really is something that one
imagines and then imposes?  Or is the imagination and imposition
something that occurs simultaneously?  Past, present, future,
"necessarily" chosen perceptions in order to prevent one's mind from
popping before the realization that it is not the spoon that bends, it
is you. :-)  In any event, are our notions of "jurisdiction"
regardless of how they are implemented or put into practice in what we
consider to be "real world," practical and reasonable, or are they
merely part of a mental prison which we routinely impose upon
Too many words, though.
Wrapping up:
The Gateless Gate  (1228)  by Mumon, translated by Nyogen
Koan number 29 out of 49 in this work (published 1228, translated 1934)
Two monks were arguing about a flag. One said: "The flag is moving."
The other said: "The wind is moving."
The sixth patriarch happened to be passing by. He told them: "Not the
wind, not the flag; mind is moving."
    Mumon’s comment: The sixth patriarch said: "The wind is not
moving, the flag is not moving. Mind is moving." What did he mean? If
you understand this intimately, you will see the two monks there
trying to buy iron and gaining gold. The sixth patriarch could not
bear to see those two dull heads, so he made such a bargain.
        Wind, flag, mind moves,
        The same understanding.
        When the mouth opens
        All are wrong.

I realize that you all have heard of this before, but you seriously
need to take a look at bitmessage or pybitmessage.  I've noticed that
some users (for example in or near China) have had major lag in
sending or receiving the messages sometimes, but it's pretty good at
avoiding censorship and traffic tracking associated with typical
server-oriented models of communication.
Works best if the bitmessage application is left running and has eight
to ten connections.

So how does one make some possible workarounds to this sort of censorship?
Well, one could make the sites be broadcast in different ways.  This
is an effort that I will simply shown in a visual manner here:
That's a lot of work but if you have your site(s) backed up to all
those places, it's hard to take them down.
But what if they are literally blocked somehow anyway?
Here's another workaround or method to avoid such censorship that I

announcements of bans of encryption in UK (which will not work) and
right at same time as announcement of "New CISPA" in United States...

expect more countries' "leaders" to throw out annoucements saying that
you can only have encryption if they let you, or they get to decide

Roskomnadzor introduced address Bitcoin.org - community of users and
experts in Cryptocurrency supported organization Bitcoin Foundation -
in the register of banned sites. In addition, the sites were blocked
bitcoin.it, coinspot.io, btsec.com and Exchange indacoin.com.
Information about this appeared on January 13 on the website

Updated at 17:13: added an excerpt from the court's decision.
The reason why the site was inscribed in the register was initially
unknown. TJ verification showed that the site is no longer open.
There is information on the benefits of Bitcoins and how to use it as
individuals and companies, as well as links to community dedicated
Bitcoin. User-generated content on the website.
According to Vladislav Zdolnikova taken after unloading from one of
the providers were also blocked sites Bitcoin.it (Wiki dedicated
Bitcoins) and Btsec.com (Russian-speaking community Bitcoin). The
reason was the decision of the court rendered more September 30, 2014.
Press secretary Vadim Roskomnadzora Ampelonsky confirmed TJ, that
dedicated Bitcoin sites are blocked on the basis of the decision of
the City Court Nevyansk Sverdlovsk region. Details of the decision he
did not elaborate.
On the Court's website states that view the text of judicial decisions
is temporarily unavailable. TJ sent to the court a copy of the request
for extradition of the judicial act to limit access to these sites.
The court was told that copies are only actors, but it is clear that
the defendant does not take part in the process. In the city
prosecutor's office offered to send an appeal to the District
prokurara on the official form by fax to the media, but this proved
impossible due to the lack of TJ media registration and fax.
Block were also Russian-speaking community coinspot.ru and Exchange

been contacted directly, and they said the decision to block the site
was taken unilaterally. After they changed the lock on the domain

proposed fine for Bitcoin mining, loading mayningovyh programs and
even spreading of information on how to Cryptocurrency sale. However,
the document was published by the Ministry of Finance October 3 -
later than the decision was made Nevyansk court.
Later Roskomnadzor published excerpts from the decision Nevyansk City
Court. Apparently, the court was guided by a statement of the Central
Bank on 27 January 2014, in which Cryptocurrency equated to money
substitutes. However, on March 4 at the Central Bank explained that it
is not prohibited Cryptocurrency in Russia.
     In accordance with Art. 27 of the Federal Law "On the Central
Bank of the Russian Federation," the official monetary unit (currency)
of the Russian Federation is the ruble. Introduction in Russia of
other monetary units and production of money substitutes is prohibited.
     In such circumstances Cryptocurrency, including "Bitcoin" are
money substitutes, contribute to the growth of the shadow economy and
can not be used by citizens and legal persons on the territory of the

Причина, по которой сайт был внесён в реестр, изначально была
неизвестна. Проверка TJ показала, что сайт перестал открываться.
На сайте опубликована информация по преимуществам биткоина и способах
его использования как отдельными людьми, так и компаниями, а также
ссылки на сообщества, посвящённые биткоину. Пользовательского контента
на сайте нет.
По информации Владислава Здольникова, взятой через выгрузку у одного
из провайдеров, заблокированными оказались также сайты Bitcoin.it
(вики-энциклопедия, посвящённая биткоинам) и Btsec.com (русскоязычное
сообщество Bitcoin). Причиной стало решение суда, вынесенное ещё 30
сентября 2014 года.
Пресс-секретарь Роскомнадзора Вадим Ампелонский подтвердил TJ, что
посвящённые биткоинам сайты блокируются на основании решения
Невьянского городского суда Свердловской области. Детали решения он не
На сайте суда говорится, что просмотр текстов судебных актов временно
недоступен. TJ направил в суд просьбу о выдаче копии судебного акта по
ограничению доступа к указанным сайтам.
В суде рассказали, что копии выдаются лишь участникам процесса, однако
очевидно, что сторона ответчиков не принимает участия в процессе. В
городской прокуратуре предложили направить обращение на имя окружного
прокурара на официальном бланке СМИ по факсу, однако это оказалось
невозможным ввиду отсутствия у TJ регистрации СМИ и факса.
Заблокированными также оказались русскоязычное сообщество coinspot.ru
и биржа indacoin.ru. Представители coinspot.ru заявили, что с ними
никто не связывался напрямую, и по их словам решение о блокировке
сайта принималось в одностороннем порядке. После блокировки они
сменили домен на coinspot.io.
Из последних государственных инициатив по регулированию биткоинов
можно выделить законопроект, подготовленный Министерством финансов, по
которому предлагалось штрафовать за добычу биткоинов, загрузку
майнинговых программ и даже за распростренение информации о способах
продажи криптовалюты. Однако документ Минфина был опубликован 3
октября — позже, чем было вынесено решение Невьянского суда.
Позже Роскомнадзор опубликовал выдержку из решения Невьянского
городского суда. Судя по всему, суд руководствовался заявлением
Центробанка от 27 января 2014 года, в котором криптовалюту приравняли
к денежным суррогатам. Правда, 4 марта в Центробанке разъяснили, что
не запрещали криптовалюту на территории РФ.
    В соответствии со ст. 27 Федерального закона «О Центральном банке
Российской Федерации» официальной денежной единицей (валютой)
Российской Федерации является рубль. Введение на территории России
других денежных единиц и выпуск денежных суррогатов запрещается.
    При таких обстоятельствах криптовалюты, в том числе «Биткоин»,
являются денежными суррогатами, способствуют росту теневой экономики и

Anyone's use of encryption for any purpose is beyond the means of any
state to control, this should have been obvious in 1992, but it seems
various states "missed the memo" and are now waking up (though they'll
always be asleep at the wheel)
I honestly think everyone will be better off as the people begin to
reclaim more of their ability to work together using new and
technological capabilities that are growing well beyond the capacity
of governmental systems that were popularized around the world in
systems that grew in popularity and "revolution-arity" approximately
226 years ago.  In other words, governments will be needed less and
less and we'll understand we need each other more and more.  It may
not be clear when governments will diminish (or disappear) and to what
extent that will happen, but I don't think obedience to them is
helpful at all.
Even so, with trustless systems, I still consider that for many
circumstances, "the relationship is the ultimate technology,"  though
one system or another we create may fail, we work together mindful of
the necessity to create new communities and systems that look forward.

Mirimir, not everyone has access to VPN.  I should point out that by
September 2015 in Russia, there is some kind of "tokenization" law
that goes into effect, which actually was adopted in 2014, which
apparently is creating all kinds of hassles for everybody ~ something
about all data having to basically be localized and tokenized and
Russianized basically.  In other words, even worse than right now today.
Don't ask me why Russian gov't is becoming probably even more
ridiculous possibly than China.  I can't tell you.  But you can see
what I mean by looking at this:
I look at that kind of stuff and I'm just... :-0 hmmmm
Now you mentioned VPNs and so for example there is Cryptostorm's free
VPN, which you can access here:
 (free! may take some
messing around with and not sure if plays well through Russia)
or our CgAN VPN, yay! (it's free.)
But, not everybody knows about such resources, and many may actually
be blocked from use of some of either the sites where they are
available or may find it difficult to find, download, and utilize the
software packages safely.
Not to say a VPN isn't going to work but more decentralized systems
that also have some of the functionality of VPNs of today may be more
logical to consider.  Similar ideas, but new models, is what I am
saying. Think forward.  Fall forward.
I do think that the (general) model used by OpenBazaar and ZeroNet is
a very good one and which will hopefully help many people (and the
content they want to get out to the world) resist censorship.

P2P, serverless microstatus system in 30 lines of pure python
(slooooowwwwww claaaaaaaappssssss)
So with that out of the way, I have to say, though, your criticism
which has appeared on my TL before of PGP is in my view, unwarranted,
because,  GnuPGP just aren't getting the funding need(ed) to get what
should be done, done.  It's been done essentially by one person.  And
frankly they could use a bit of help in getting out the word.
Here's a thoughtful post from bytemark on this subject:
(Please read it)
(from Dec. 31, 2014)
Then go on to read this thing:
As you see they accept all kinds of payment vehicles (and also bitcoin
is one of them)
And now here's the kicker:  This two-person team which they are trying
to get funded, IS NOT FUNDED!
Take a look here:
NOT. FUNDED.
And yes, interfaces like Keybase.io _are_ the future (I've been
playing around with it and currently have it in my signature, though I
use a different key block (not keybase) for people to use for to
import in association with my e-mail), because they make it easier for
a larger number of people to access keys either through something like
keybase service where they host keys, or through a CLI where you hold
all that closely.  Merkle tree, blockchain, etc.  But this begins in
my view with a strong froundation, which we have from the work which
was done from Gnupg.  (In fact, Keybase.io, and any business like it
in the future, relies on Gnupg.)  If I was rolling in dough ($$) right
now I would dump a giant fat amount of 86,000 € that they are missing
so that they would be able to get going on the Gnupg second
developer's work right away.
So... enough of the rambling on, can someone who knows someone who has
benefited from this economic ups and downs, please forward this e-mail
on to them and ask them if they'd be willing to contribute to
I have absolutely zero financial interest in seeing this happen but I
know it would help make a better world.

tl;dr ..... or not?
If it's free and open source and not part of what is produced by a
corporation (and is auditable) (and can be held in repositories in a
bunch of different places that can be compared to each other so as to
make sure that the place for public to download isn't just infected
with crap from government), then great!
If it is not free and open source and if it relies in any way on any
corporation and cannot be downloaded directly from github or a similar
repository system, then oh well, you aren't going to be able to rely
on it, because the corporation (in the US and in most places in the
world) isn't going to be able to legally operate and certainly won't
be able to legally distribute to the US without license from the USG.
And that is all, and the EFF can huff and puff but at the end of the
day there will be no large scale uprising because the level of apathy
in the US is at an all time high.  I mean, how many years has EFF been
with Jewel v. NSA in the courts?  Their lawyers might die before the
case gets resolution.
People are kind of excited about CISPA fight (and maybe the mailing
lists that are used to fight CISPA could also be used for fighting
Obama and Cameron on encryption), though I sense that is kind of
wearing thin after so many damn repeats of the same thing. Over and over.
One of the things I suggest doing is just saying screw humanity for a
while.  Put some of our best, most hardcore code, like Gnupg (gpg) and
some of the best stuff, that you could think of (I happen to like
textsecure) - look, I'm sure you could think of all kinds of amazing
things - just examples of really good crypto.  You know, like bitcoin
(BTC) and BCN.  And put all this stuff in as examples of like, an
undersea Voyager 1.  And then send it to the bottom of the ocean.  And
tell it to come back in like 10 years, or 50 years, but to, you know,
check back from a distance first, to make sure that we are not dead
first, to make sure we haven't killed ourselves off or that we haven't
screwed up even more than we have already.
So here is my concept project for an undersea Voyager 1:
On Github:
The idea is there is code and DNA kind of mixed together in an
Autonomous Knowledge Node, protected in a robotic hard shell as an
OpenROV, sort of like a little submarine, but it can reproduce in
certain conditions.  And it can then communicate with other species.
It will try to learn things to bring back from the depths to help us
survive, assuming we are still alive when we return.  (And of course
it will bring back the crypto it carried along as well sort of like
the Golden Platter of Voyager 1 or something)
This is kind of along ramble, so I'll just be quiet now.

no, peerio, problematic due to, in part,
1) third party broad spectrum surveillance from cromnibus.
(kind of a serious problem for anything that involves initial setup or
later login through website actually)
 See Title III, Subtitle A, Section 309
this is mitigated in part for such services where keys are not hosted
by the service (e.g. w/ keybase you can refuse to have stuff hosted on
keybase, and can (if you wish) do commands only from CLI after
deciding to host keys on your own machine, but assuming you log in
through web-app / website, then you end up subject to this third party
stuff mentioned above)
2) If I understand this correctly with peerio (and I don't possibly,
since I am unlikely to ever use it as it appears to be a centralized
service), but:
"Instead of dealing with key storage, Peerio generates a user’s
private key from his passphrase every time he or she logs in."
That may or may not accurately describe the process, however.
3) Free, or not?
Apparently there is a paid option, and a free option initially at
launch, there is a open source repository on github.  To the extent
that the crypto is tied to a company (kind of assumed, if there is a
paid option and there is an LLC or something like that), then the
corporation is vulnerable to being shut down or at the very least
"conditioned" ~ being told what to do when "crypto licenses" come into
play, which already exist in Russia, for example, are anticipated in
the UK (see also Belarus, where the Info Minister thinks that the
Internet exists to "serve the Fatherland"), and in the US, where Obama
is developing a really warm friendship with Cameron on the anti-crypto
Frankly I am just going to stay far away as I can from anything that
involves this kind of web-based model.  There is too much compromise
involved and too much insecurity.

As stated in the github on ImmortalCode, I'm totally down for
And, I haven't set up a mechanism to fund this, but I know from
memory, an OpenROV to ensconce it in costs not much ~ though the
polymerase chain reaction stuff, DNA work, crypto, seed and genome
bank you want to pack in, would certainly cost more than jut the
OpenROV machinery, but actually the overall project is low cost by the
time you are done with the thing. Greater difficulty would be to
determine how to ensure it would reproduce itself at depth, tougher
than just producing a wandering rover sort of thing, for sure (partly
due to that we don't know what happens in most parts of the deep), and
also due to the complexity of merging Turritopsis dohrnii DNA with
Open Worm DNA (in biological form, a Caenorhabditis Elegans, which has
302 neurons and 959 cells), as well as inserting a "human signal" in
the form of a tiny segment of human DNA into the modified T. dohrnii
as well before protecting the creature within a modified OpenROV to
help protect it and ensure its safe return to land. A significant
amount of initial design would be necessary to determine what
equipment and sensors it would have so that it would run with in
tandem with knowledge nodes that would enable it to share knowledge
between species across vast areas of the ocean without human
intervention.  That's the general idea, anyway.

Five things
1) Please publish suggested guid(es) here in Russian and English for
how people should install and maintain Gnupg - gpg - seems like after
many years that program is not getting the support it needs - so here
is the fundraiser link again for it.  (Look at all the payment methods!)
Some suggestions are in English here at only the most basic level and
not dealing with any complexities, but I suggest people start talking
about standards for how to reply to lists and forums as well as how to
communicate amongst each other just one on one for example:
2) I know someone here will say "off topic" but there is nothing off
topic about having people address what needs to be addressed, like
hopefully getting more people talking about the possibilities of
learning different and better ways of strong (and hopefully easier to
use) crypto.
2.a) if you don't like seeing it here please start new thread, which
is probably a great idea.  If questions about that, please see prior
item, if that does not address the issue of OT, please see item 3 below.
3) You think this is off topic? see number 2.a above.
4) More back OT:  People will use what they want to use no matter
where they are in the world.  There are Russians using Gnupg, but it
would be not a good idea for me to say who I've observed does so.
There are Russians examining this GOST thing.  Russian Federation /
Waasenaar arrangment (a stupid idea meant to appease people who think
that gov't controls on cryptography actually have meaning or purpose)
- - involves import, export, and use.  Anyway, no matter what country
you are in, do what you want, and take care that you are not harmed in

@_author: odinn 
@_subject: John Gilmore: Cryptography list is censoring my emails 
Hash: SHA512
It's unclear to me what exactly is causing said censorship lately.
But I've seen some unusual amount of what (in my eyes) is censorship
occur across totally different lists and forums over the past few
weeks.  It's hard to say "oh that occured here, here and here!"
because your thought may be way different than mine on where that
actually occurred, so I'll just shut up on that threshold piece. (IMHO
it's when someone keeps your content from appearing or just disappears
something you've posted, in a very simplistic overview, of the list
question) However...  In each case the common thread which seemed to
actually result in censorship being initiated (wherever you might
think it was), was someone posting something (or trying to express
something) relating to crypto, identity, or anonymity related.  No
surprise there.  It also seemed to occur in the last few weeks of this
year, or more recently which was kind of odd.  I disagree with anyone
who might propose the whole "lizard theory" of censorship, as I think
that any list or forum censorship (where it does occur) has nothing
(or almost zero) to do with any lizard antics and much more to do with
underlying "earth core displacement" issues that touch on major
differences both within crypto communities themselves and also within
(probably overly) curious members of investigatory / LEO communities.
Finally, it has not escaped my attention that the recent attacks on
Tor or portions of the Tor network, could have been enough to broaden
block lists (whether this block list / spam effect bit would be
intentional or not) which would result in delivery of  information to
- -  and   (see
 - where sorbs
and barracudacentral for example might then become recipients
(inexpensively and quickly) of even larger amounts of IP addresses
than before, which could be in certain situations shown as spam
addresses, at least during the time of the brief and limited attacks
on Tor late last year.  See for example:
 and look towards bottom of
page thing.  This might have briefly caused some (Tor) users, for
example, to have had limited accessibility to some sites, in some
circumstances - even if unintentional.  I am not going to go on some
long ass rantarola on how this could or could not happen. It hurts my
back to be sitting here typing so I'll slow down and stop real soon.
Tear me to shreds on this idea if you wish, but it is entirely
possible that this could have occurred in some parts of the network(s).
As to the actual result of this process in _intentional_ censorship,
wherever and however that actually occurs:  Unacceptable.
I have also noticed that pybitmessage / bitmessage has been having
more lag issues lately esp. when the messages are being sent /
received to / from China.  This is less a problem if sent from a
"free-er" zone (e.g. Macao, Japan... the latter of which is, well...
really not freeish at all) but still... can be issues. Not sure if
anyone here has experienced same things so I've been encouraging
people to be cautious with pybitmessage / bitmessage atm and use gpg
more in 2015.  Best encryption is best thing... I truly hope gnupg -
gpg will get fully funded soon
( hey! see this! includes bitcoin as option for donation to gpg project:
  )
Then that which is is decentralized is best thing.  This is why I will
keep yammering about why we should be using truly decentralized
solutions such as... not just btc but also things like bcn, hopefully
we will see zerocash in early 2015 sometime, and openbazaar is already
working.  We have models which will work without requiring a state
model, but which don't require that we participate in the same
tiresome and violent struggles time and time again either.  T. May's
thoughts in 1992 seemed crazy to most people who would have read them
at that time.
Now they just sort of seem like a first step in whatever's next.
What's next?
Just kind of rolling this around in my brain, by the way:

Koan number 29 out of 49 in this work (published 1228, translated 1934)
Two monks were arguing about a flag. One said: "The flag is moving."
The other said: "The wind is moving."
The sixth patriarch happened to be passing by. He told them: "Not the
wind, not the flag; mind is moving."
    Mumon’s comment: The sixth patriarch said: "The wind is not
moving, the flag is not moving. Mind is moving." What did he mean? If
you understand this intimately, you will see the two monks there
trying to buy iron and gaining gold. The sixth patriarch could not
bear to see those two dull heads, so he made such a bargain.

avoiding censorship and traffic tracking associated with typical

очевидно, что сторона ответчиков не принимает участия в процессе. В
городской прокуратуре предложили направить обращение на имя окружного
прокурара на официальном бланке СМИ по факсу, однако это оказалось
невозможным ввиду отсутствия у TJ регистрации СМИ и факса.

никто не связывался напрямую, и по их словам решение о блокировке
сайта принималось в одностороннем порядке. После блокировки они

Из последних государственных инициатив по регулированию биткоинов
можно выделить законопроект, подготовленный Министерством финансов, по
которому предлагалось штрафовать за добычу биткоинов, загрузку

продажи криптовалюты. Однако документ Минфина был опубликован 3
октября — позже, чем было вынесено решение Невьянского суда.
Позже Роскомнадзор опубликовал выдержку из решения Невьянского

of governmental systems that were popularized around the world in
systems that grew in popularity and "revolution-arity" approximately
226 years ago.  In other words, governments will be needed less and
less and we'll understand we need each other more and more.  It may
not be clear when governments will diminish (or disappear) and to what
extent that will happen, but I don't think obedience to them is
helpful at all.
Even so, with trustless systems, I still consider that for many
circumstances, "the relationship is the ultimate technology,"  though
one system or another we create may fail, we work together mindful of
the necessity to create new communities and systems that look forward.

Mirimir, not everyone has access to VPN.  I should point out that by
September 2015 in Russia, there is some kind of "tokenization" law
that goes into effect, which actually was adopted in 2014, which
apparently is creating all kinds of hassles for everybody ~ something
about all data having to basically be localized and tokenized and
Russianized basically.  In other words, even worse than right now today.
Don't ask me why Russian gov't is becoming probably even more
ridiculous possibly than China.  I can't tell you.  But you can see
what I mean by looking at this:
I look at that kind of stuff and I'm just... :-0 hmmmm
Now you mentioned VPNs and so for example there is Cryptostorm's free
VPN, which you can access here:
 (free! may take some
messing around with and not sure if plays well through Russia)
or our CgAN VPN, yay! (it's free.)
But, not everybody knows about such resources, and many may actually
be blocked from use of some of either the sites where they are
available or may find it difficult to find, download, and utilize the
software packages safely.
Not to say a VPN isn't going to work but more decentralized systems
that also have some of the functionality of VPNs of today may be more
logical to consider.  Similar ideas, but new models, is what I am
saying. Think forward.  Fall forward.
I do think that the (general) model used by OpenBazaar and ZeroNet is
a very good one and which will hopefully help many people (and the
content they want to get out to the world) resist censorship.

On this whole point of Gnupg (gpg) and some of the issues with using

from sources I've compiled in a way that people seem to like and have
found helpful:
Crazy Strong:  "learn or die" in 2015  All systems
See also on twitter as:
which has caused Gnupg / thunderbird / etc. awareness to reach 14,685
accounts that might otherwise not have seen it.
based on an analysis from Learn or die folks.
but you may ask, what about the transitions? new machine? older key
issues? proper use? getting stronger new key? etc.
valid questions! which is what I am asking myself right now (since I
have some old key issues that I am trying to work through and I didn't
have good answers).
fortunately, rysiek came to the rescue in a very timely way, and gave
me permission to republish (rysiek's) statement which appears below:
rysiek explains:

Look... Cathal, I do like what you've done in the tiny realm of code ~
short, simple, and to the point, some examples being:
Deadlock ~ dead simple encryption
P2P, serverless microstatus system in 30 lines of pure python
(slooooowwwwww claaaaaaaappssssss)
So with that out of the way, I have to say, though, your criticism
which has appeared on my TL before of PGP is in my view, unwarranted,
because,  GnuPGP just aren't getting the funding need(ed) to get what
should be done, done.  It's been done essentially by one person.  And
frankly they could use a bit of help in getting out the word.
Here's a thoughtful post from bytemark on this subject:
(Please read it)
(from Dec. 31, 2014)
Then go on to read this thing:
As you see they accept all kinds of payment vehicles (and also bitcoin
is one of them)
And now here's the kicker:  This two-person team which they are trying
to get funded, IS NOT FUNDED!
Take a look here:
NOT. FUNDED.
And yes, interfaces like Keybase.io _are_ the future (I've been
playing around with it and currently have it in my signature, though I
use a different key block (not keybase) for people to use for to
import in association with my e-mail), because they make it easier for
a larger number of people to access keys either through something like
keybase service where they host keys, or through a CLI where you hold
all that closely.  Merkle tree, blockchain, etc.  But this begins in
my view with a strong froundation, which we have from the work which
was done from Gnupg.  (In fact, Keybase.io, and any business like it
in the future, relies on Gnupg.)  If I was rolling in dough ($$) right
now I would dump a giant fat amount of 86,000 € that they are missing
so that they would be able to get going on the Gnupg second
developer's work right away.
So... enough of the rambling on, can someone who knows someone who has
benefited from this economic ups and downs, please forward this e-mail
on to them and ask them if they'd be willing to contribute to
I have absolutely zero financial interest in seeing this happen but I
know it would help make a better world.

tl;dr ..... or not?
If it's free and open source and not part of what is produced by a
corporation (and is auditable) (and can be held in repositories in a
bunch of different places that can be compared to each other so as to
make sure that the place for public to download isn't just infected
with crap from government), then great!
If it is not free and open source and if it relies in any way on any
corporation and cannot be downloaded directly from github or a similar
repository system, then oh well, you aren't going to be able to rely
on it, because the corporation (in the US and in most places in the
world) isn't going to be able to legally operate and certainly won't
be able to legally distribute to the US without license from the USG.
And that is all, and the EFF can huff and puff but at the end of the
day there will be no large scale uprising because the level of apathy
in the US is at an all time high.  I mean, how many years has EFF been
with Jewel v. NSA in the courts?  Their lawyers might die before the
case gets resolution.
People are kind of excited about CISPA fight (and maybe the mailing
lists that are used to fight CISPA could also be used for fighting
Obama and Cameron on encryption), though I sense that is kind of
wearing thin after so many damn repeats of the same thing. Over and over.
One of the things I suggest doing is just saying screw humanity for a
while.  Put some of our best, most hardcore code, like Gnupg (gpg) and
some of the best stuff, that you could think of (I happen to like
textsecure) - look, I'm sure you could think of all kinds of amazing
things - just examples of really good crypto.  You know, like bitcoin
(BTC) and BCN.  And put all this stuff in as examples of like, an
undersea Voyager 1.  And then send it to the bottom of the ocean.  And
tell it to come back in like 10 years, or 50 years, but to, you know,
check back from a distance first, to make sure that we are not dead
first, to make sure we haven't killed ourselves off or that we haven't
screwed up even more than we have already.
So here is my concept project for an undersea Voyager 1:
On Github:
The idea is there is code and DNA kind of mixed together in an
Autonomous Knowledge Node, protected in a robotic hard shell as an
OpenROV, sort of like a little submarine, but it can reproduce in
certain conditions.  And it can then communicate with other species.
It will try to learn things to bring back from the depths to help us
survive, assuming we are still alive when we return.  (And of course
it will bring back the crypto it carried along as well sort of like
the Golden Platter of Voyager 1 or something)
This is kind of along ramble, so I'll just be quiet now.

no, peerio, problematic due to, in part,
1) third party broad spectrum surveillance from cromnibus.
(kind of a serious problem for anything that involves initial setup or
later login through website actually)
 See Title III, Subtitle A, Section 309
this is mitigated in part for such services where keys are not hosted
by the service (e.g. w/ keybase you can refuse to have stuff hosted on
keybase, and can (if you wish) do commands only from CLI after
deciding to host keys on your own machine, but assuming you log in
through web-app / website, then you end up subject to this third party
stuff mentioned above)
2) If I understand this correctly with peerio (and I don't possibly,
since I am unlikely to ever use it as it appears to be a centralized
service), but:
"Instead of dealing with key storage, Peerio generates a user’s
private key from his passphrase every time he or she logs in."
That may or may not accurately describe the process, however.
3) Free, or not?
Apparently there is a paid option, and a free option initially at
launch, there is a open source repository on github.  To the extent
that the crypto is tied to a company (kind of assumed, if there is a
paid option and there is an LLC or something like that), then the
corporation is vulnerable to being shut down or at the very least
"conditioned" ~ being told what to do when "crypto licenses" come into
play, which already exist in Russia, for example, are anticipated in
the UK (see also Belarus, where the Info Minister thinks that the
Internet exists to "serve the Fatherland"), and in the US, where Obama
is developing a really warm friendship with Cameron on the anti-crypto
Frankly I am just going to stay far away as I can from anything that
involves this kind of web-based model.  There is too much compromise
involved and too much insecurity.

As stated in the github on ImmortalCode, I'm totally down for
And, I haven't set up a mechanism to fund this, but I know from
memory, an OpenROV to ensconce it in costs not much ~ though the
polymerase chain reaction stuff, DNA work, crypto, seed and genome
bank you want to pack in, would certainly cost more than jut the
OpenROV machinery, but actually the overall project is low cost by the
time you are done with the thing. Greater difficulty would be to
determine how to ensure it would reproduce itself at depth, tougher
than just producing a wandering rover sort of thing, for sure (partly
due to that we don't know what happens in most parts of the deep), and
also due to the complexity of merging Turritopsis dohrnii DNA with
Open Worm DNA (in biological form, a Caenorhabditis Elegans, which has
302 neurons and 959 cells), as well as inserting a "human signal" in
the form of a tiny segment of human DNA into the modified T. dohrnii
as well before protecting the creature within a modified OpenROV to
help protect it and ensure its safe return to land. A significant
amount of initial design would be necessary to determine what
equipment and sensors it would have so that it would run with in
tandem with knowledge nodes that would enable it to share knowledge
between species across vast areas of the ocean without human
intervention.  That's the general idea, anyway.

Five things
1) Please publish suggested guid(es) here in Russian and English for
how people should install and maintain Gnupg - gpg - seems like after
many years that program is not getting the support it needs - so here
is the fundraiser link again for it.  (Look at all the payment methods!)
Some suggestions are in English here at only the most basic level and
not dealing with any complexities, but I suggest people start talking
about standards for how to reply to lists and forums as well as how to
communicate amongst each other just one on one for example:
2) I know someone here will say "off topic" but there is nothing off
topic about having people address what needs to be addressed, like
hopefully getting more people talking about the possibilities of
learning different and better ways of strong (and hopefully easier to
use) crypto.
2.a) if you don't like seeing it here please start new thread, which
is probably a great idea.  If questions about that, please see prior
item, if that does not address the issue of OT, please see item 3 below.
3) You think this is off topic? see number 2.a above.
4) More back OT:  People will use what they want to use no matter
where they are in the world.  There are Russians using Gnupg, but it
would be not a good idea for me to say who I've observed does so.
There are Russians examining this GOST thing.  Russian Federation /
Waasenaar arrangment (a stupid idea meant to appease people who think
that gov't controls on cryptography actually have meaning or purpose)
- - involves import, export, and use.  Anyway, no matter what country
you are in, do what you want, and take care that you are not harmed in

@_author: odinn 
@_subject: John Gilmore: Cryptography list is censoring my emails 
Hash: SHA512
It's unclear to me what exactly is causing said censorship lately.
But I've seen some unusual amount of what (in my eyes) is censorship
occur across totally different lists and forums over the past few
weeks.  It's hard to say "oh that occured here, here and here!"
because your thought may be way different than mine on where that
actually occurred, so I'll just shut up on that threshold piece. (IMHO
it's when someone keeps your content from appearing or just disappears
something you've posted, in a very simplistic overview, of the list
question) However...  In each case the common thread which seemed to
actually result in censorship being initiated (wherever you might
think it was), was someone posting something (or trying to express
something) relating to crypto, identity, or anonymity related.  No
surprise there.  It also seemed to occur in the last few weeks of this
year, or more recently which was kind of odd.  I disagree with anyone
who might propose the whole "lizard theory" of censorship, as I think
that any list or forum censorship (where it does occur) has nothing
(or almost zero) to do with any lizard antics and much more to do with
underlying "earth core displacement" issues that touch on major
differences both within crypto communities themselves and also within
(probably overly) curious members of investigatory / LEO communities.
Finally, it has not escaped my attention that the recent attacks on
Tor or portions of the Tor network, could have been enough to broaden
block lists (whether this block list / spam effect bit would be
intentional or not) which would result in delivery of  information to
- -  and   (see
 - where sorbs
and barracudacentral for example might then become recipients
(inexpensively and quickly) of even larger amounts of IP addresses
than before, which could be in certain situations shown as spam
addresses, at least during the time of the brief and limited attacks
on Tor late last year.  See for example:
 and look towards bottom of
page thing.  This might have briefly caused some (Tor) users, for
example, to have had limited accessibility to some sites, in some
circumstances - even if unintentional.  I am not going to go on some
long ass rantarola on how this could or could not happen. It hurts my
back to be sitting here typing so I'll slow down and stop real soon.
Tear me to shreds on this idea if you wish, but it is entirely
possible that this could have occurred in some parts of the network(s).
As to the actual result of this process in _intentional_ censorship,
wherever and however that actually occurs:  Unacceptable.
I have also noticed that pybitmessage / bitmessage has been having
more lag issues lately esp. when the messages are being sent /
received to / from China.  This is less a problem if sent from a
"free-er" zone (e.g. Macao, Japan... the latter of which is, well...
really not freeish at all) but still... can be issues. Not sure if
anyone here has experienced same things so I've been encouraging
people to be cautious with pybitmessage / bitmessage atm and use gpg
more in 2015.  Best encryption is best thing... I truly hope gnupg -
gpg will get fully funded soon
( hey! see this! includes bitcoin as option for donation to gpg project:
  )
Then that which is is decentralized is best thing.  This is why I will
keep yammering about why we should be using truly decentralized
solutions such as... not just btc but also things like bcn, hopefully
we will see zerocash in early 2015 sometime, and openbazaar is already
working.  We have models which will work without requiring a state
model, but which don't require that we participate in the same
tiresome and violent struggles time and time again either.  T. May's
thoughts in 1992 seemed crazy to most people who would have read them
at that time.
Now they just sort of seem like a first step in whatever's next.
What's next?
Just kind of rolling this around in my brain, by the way:

Two monks were arguing about a flag. One said: "The flag is moving."
The other said: "The wind is moving."
The sixth patriarch happened to be passing by. He told them: "Not the
wind, not the flag; mind is moving."
    Mumon’s comment: The sixth patriarch said: "The wind is not
moving, the flag is not moving. Mind is moving." What did he mean? If
you understand this intimately, you will see the two monks there
trying to buy iron and gaining gold. The sixth patriarch could not
bear to see those two dull heads, so he made such a bargain.

some users (for example in or near China) have had major lag in

avoiding censorship and traffic tracking associated with typical

That's a lot of work but if you have your site(s) backed up to all

Роскомнадзор заблокировал пять посвящённых биткоинам сайтов
Роскомнадзор внёс адрес Bitcoin.org — сообщества пользователей и
специалистов по криптовалюте, поддерживаемый организацией Bitcoin
Foundation — в реестр запрещённых сайтов. Кроме того, заблокированными
оказались сайты bitcoin.it, coinspot.io, btsec.com и биржа
indacoin.com. Информация об этом появилась 13 января на сайте

Обновлено в 17:13: добавлена выдержка из решения суда.
Причина, по которой сайт был внесён в реестр, изначально была
неизвестна. Проверка TJ показала, что сайт перестал открываться.
На сайте опубликована информация по преимуществам биткоина и способах
его использования как отдельными людьми, так и компаниями, а также
ссылки на сообщества, посвящённые биткоину. Пользовательского контента
на сайте нет.
По информации Владислава Здольникова, взятой через выгрузку у одного
из провайдеров, заблокированными оказались также сайты Bitcoin.it
(вики-энциклопедия, посвящённая биткоинам) и Btsec.com (русскоязычное
сообщество Bitcoin). Причиной стало решение суда, вынесенное ещё 30
сентября 2014 года.
Пресс-секретарь Роскомнадзора Вадим Ампелонский подтвердил TJ, что
посвящённые биткоинам сайты блокируются на основании решения
Невьянского городского суда Свердловской области. Детали решения он не
На сайте суда говорится, что просмотр текстов судебных актов временно
недоступен. TJ направил в суд просьбу о выдаче копии судебного акта по
ограничению доступа к указанным сайтам.
В суде рассказали, что копии выдаются лишь участникам процесса, однако
очевидно, что сторона ответчиков не принимает участия в процессе. В
городской прокуратуре предложили направить обращение на имя окружного
прокурара на официальном бланке СМИ по факсу, однако это оказалось
невозможным ввиду отсутствия у TJ регистрации СМИ и факса.
Заблокированными также оказались русскоязычное сообщество coinspot.ru
и биржа indacoin.ru. Представители coinspot.ru заявили, что с ними
никто не связывался напрямую, и по их словам решение о блокировке
сайта принималось в одностороннем порядке. После блокировки они
сменили домен на coinspot.io.
Из последних государственных инициатив по регулированию биткоинов
можно выделить законопроект, подготовленный Министерством финансов, по
которому предлагалось штрафовать за добычу биткоинов, загрузку
майнинговых программ и даже за распростренение информации о способах
продажи криптовалюты. Однако документ Минфина был опубликован 3
октября — позже, чем было вынесено решение Невьянского суда.
Позже Роскомнадзор опубликовал выдержку из решения Невьянского
городского суда. Судя по всему, суд руководствовался заявлением
Центробанка от 27 января 2014 года, в котором криптовалюту приравняли
к денежным суррогатам. Правда, 4 марта в Центробанке разъяснили, что
не запрещали криптовалюту на территории РФ.
    В соответствии со ст. 27 Федерального закона «О Центральном банке
Российской Федерации» официальной денежной единицей (валютой)
Российской Федерации является рубль. Введение на территории России
других денежных единиц и выпуск денежных суррогатов запрещается.
    При таких обстоятельствах криптовалюты, в том числе «Биткоин»,
являются денежными суррогатами, способствуют росту теневой экономики и
не могут быть использованы гражданами и юридическими лицами на
территории Российской Федерации. из решения №2-978 Невьянского

Anyone's use of encryption for any purpose is beyond the means of any
state to control, this should have been obvious in 1992, but it seems
various states "missed the memo" and are now waking up (though they'll
always be asleep at the wheel)
I honestly think everyone will be better off as the people begin to
reclaim more of their ability to work together using new and
technological capabilities that are growing well beyond the capacity
of governmental systems that were popularized around the world in
systems that grew in popularity and "revolution-arity" approximately
226 years ago.  In other words, governments will be needed less and
less and we'll understand we need each other more and more.  It may
not be clear when governments will diminish (or disappear) and to what
extent that will happen, but I don't think obedience to them is
helpful at all.
Even so, with trustless systems, I still consider that for many
circumstances, "the relationship is the ultimate technology,"  though
one system or another we create may fail, we work together mindful of
the necessity to create new communities and systems that look forward.

Mirimir, not everyone has access to VPN.  I should point out that by
September 2015 in Russia, there is some kind of "tokenization" law
that goes into effect, which actually was adopted in 2014, which
apparently is creating all kinds of hassles for everybody ~ something
about all data having to basically be localized and tokenized and
Russianized basically.  In other words, even worse than right now today.
Don't ask me why Russian gov't is becoming probably even more
ridiculous possibly than China.  I can't tell you.  But you can see
what I mean by looking at this:
I look at that kind of stuff and I'm just... :-0 hmmmm
Now you mentioned VPNs and so for example there is Cryptostorm's free
VPN, which you can access here:
 (free! may take some
messing around with and not sure if plays well through Russia)
or our CgAN VPN, yay! (it's free.)
But, not everybody knows about such resources, and many may actually
be blocked from use of some of either the sites where they are
available or may find it difficult to find, download, and utilize the
software packages safely.
Not to say a VPN isn't going to work but more decentralized systems
that also have some of the functionality of VPNs of today may be more
logical to consider.  Similar ideas, but new models, is what I am
saying. Think forward.  Fall forward.
I do think that the (general) model used by OpenBazaar and ZeroNet is
a very good one and which will hopefully help many people (and the
content they want to get out to the world) resist censorship.

Deadlock ~ dead simple encryption
P2P, serverless microstatus system in 30 lines of pure python
(slooooowwwwww claaaaaaaappssssss)
So with that out of the way, I have to say, though, your criticism
which has appeared on my TL before of PGP is in my view, unwarranted,
because,  GnuPGP just aren't getting the funding need(ed) to get what
should be done, done.  It's been done essentially by one person.  And
frankly they could use a bit of help in getting out the word.
Here's a thoughtful post from bytemark on this subject:

(from Dec. 31, 2014)
Then go on to read this thing:
As you see they accept all kinds of payment vehicles (and also bitcoin
is one of them)
And now here's the kicker:  This two-person team which they are trying
to get funded, IS NOT FUNDED!
Take a look here:
NOT. FUNDED.
And yes, interfaces like Keybase.io _are_ the future (I've been
playing around with it and currently have it in my signature, though I
use a different key block (not keybase) for people to use for to
import in association with my e-mail), because they make it easier for
a larger number of people to access keys either through something like
keybase service where they host keys, or through a CLI where you hold
all that closely.  Merkle tree, blockchain, etc.  But this begins in
my view with a strong froundation, which we have from the work which
was done from Gnupg.  (In fact, Keybase.io, and any business like it
in the future, relies on Gnupg.)  If I was rolling in dough ($$) right
now I would dump a giant fat amount of 86,000 € that they are missing
so that they would be able to get going on the Gnupg second
developer's work right away.
So... enough of the rambling on, can someone who knows someone who has
benefited from this economic ups and downs, please forward this e-mail
on to them and ask them if they'd be willing to contribute to
I have absolutely zero financial interest in seeing this happen but I
know it would help make a better world.

tl;dr ..... or not?
If it's free and open source and not part of what is produced by a
corporation (and is auditable) (and can be held in repositories in a
bunch of different places that can be compared to each other so as to
make sure that the place for public to download isn't just infected
with crap from government), then great!
If it is not free and open source and if it relies in any way on any
corporation and cannot be downloaded directly from github or a similar
repository system, then oh well, you aren't going to be able to rely
on it, because the corporation (in the US and in most places in the
world) isn't going to be able to legally operate and certainly won't
be able to legally distribute to the US without license from the USG.
And that is all, and the EFF can huff and puff but at the end of the
day there will be no large scale uprising because the level of apathy
in the US is at an all time high.  I mean, how many years has EFF been
with Jewel v. NSA in the courts?  Their lawyers might die before the
case gets resolution.
People are kind of excited about CISPA fight (and maybe the mailing
lists that are used to fight CISPA could also be used for fighting
Obama and Cameron on encryption), though I sense that is kind of
wearing thin after so many damn repeats of the same thing. Over and over.
One of the things I suggest doing is just saying screw humanity for a
while.  Put some of our best, most hardcore code, like Gnupg (gpg) and
some of the best stuff, that you could think of (I happen to like
textsecure) - look, I'm sure you could think of all kinds of amazing
things - just examples of really good crypto.  You know, like bitcoin
(BTC) and BCN.  And put all this stuff in as examples of like, an
undersea Voyager 1.  And then send it to the bottom of the ocean.  And
tell it to come back in like 10 years, or 50 years, but to, you know,
check back from a distance first, to make sure that we are not dead
first, to make sure we haven't killed ourselves off or that we haven't
screwed up even more than we have already.
So here is my concept project for an undersea Voyager 1:
On Github:
The idea is there is code and DNA kind of mixed together in an
Autonomous Knowledge Node, protected in a robotic hard shell as an
OpenROV, sort of like a little submarine, but it can reproduce in
certain conditions.  And it can then communicate with other species.
It will try to learn things to bring back from the depths to help us
survive, assuming we are still alive when we return.  (And of course
it will bring back the crypto it carried along as well sort of like
the Golden Platter of Voyager 1 or something)
This is kind of along ramble, so I'll just be quiet now.

no, peerio, problematic due to, in part,
1) third party broad spectrum surveillance from cromnibus.
(kind of a serious problem for anything that involves initial setup or
later login through website actually)
 See Title III, Subtitle A, Section 309
this is mitigated in part for such services where keys are not hosted
by the service (e.g. w/ keybase you can refuse to have stuff hosted on
keybase, and can (if you wish) do commands only from CLI after
deciding to host keys on your own machine, but assuming you log in
through web-app / website, then you end up subject to this third party
stuff mentioned above)
2) If I understand this correctly with peerio (and I don't possibly,
since I am unlikely to ever use it as it appears to be a centralized
service), but:
"Instead of dealing with key storage, Peerio generates a user’s
private key from his passphrase every time he or she logs in."
That may or may not accurately describe the process, however.
3) Free, or not?
Apparently there is a paid option, and a free option initially at
launch, there is a open source repository on github.  To the extent
that the crypto is tied to a company (kind of assumed, if there is a
paid option and there is an LLC or something like that), then the
corporation is vulnerable to being shut down or at the very least
"conditioned" ~ being told what to do when "crypto licenses" come into
play, which already exist in Russia, for example, are anticipated in
the UK (see also Belarus, where the Info Minister thinks that the
Internet exists to "serve the Fatherland"), and in the US, where Obama
is developing a really warm friendship with Cameron on the anti-crypto
Frankly I am just going to stay far away as I can from anything that

polymerase chain reaction stuff, DNA work, crypto, seed and genome
bank you want to pack in, would certainly cost more than jut the
OpenROV machinery, but actually the overall project is low cost by the
time you are done with the thing. Greater difficulty would be to
determine how to ensure it would reproduce itself at depth, tougher
than just producing a wandering rover sort of thing, for sure (partly
due to that we don't know what happens in most parts of the deep), and
also due to the complexity of merging Turritopsis dohrnii DNA with
Open Worm DNA (in biological form, a Caenorhabditis Elegans, which has
302 neurons and 959 cells), as well as inserting a "human signal" in
the form of a tiny segment of human DNA into the modified T. dohrnii
as well before protecting the creature within a modified OpenROV to
help protect it and ensure its safe return to land. A significant
amount of initial design would be necessary to determine what
equipment and sensors it would have so that it would run with in
tandem with knowledge nodes that would enable it to share knowledge
between species across vast areas of the ocean without human
intervention.  That's the general idea, anyway.

Hash: SHA1
A while back (specifically, on 6/01/2015) I sent in a FOIA request to
the NSA, requesting, in part, records about myself that "would have
been collected by the NSA under programs authorized by Sections 206
and 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, and Section 6001(a) of the IRTPA,
aforementioned programs and sections which are now expired as of the
date of this request (June 1, 2015)."
In essence, I figured, since the underlying legal authority for the
program had lapsed (however briefly), there was no time like that
present moment to file a FOIA request. And so, I did, not using USPS
mail, but a digital service to ensure it would arrive timely.
My request was actually rather lengthy; that was just a small part,
and I requested any NSA records collected on my person as a result of
use of Sections 206 or 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, or Section 6001(a)
of the IRTPA, from Oct. 26, 2001 to the date of expiration and sunset
of those Sections on midnight May 31st 2015.
(For those who are trying to remember the timeline of what ended up
replacing all that, the USA Freedom Act was signed into law on June 2,
          ~~
The NSA failed to respond within the 20 business days required by
federal law and sent back a "Glomar response."  Technically, as of
today, I only have 49 days left to write and send an appeal (based on
the date when they sent me their Glomar reply).
if you have ever done a SUCCESSful appeal of a Glomar response, please
reply back to me and let me know (give me some advice, etc).  Thanks
in advance.
I've copied a portion of the letter they sent below:
"As you may also be aware, there has been considerable coverage of two
NSA intelligence programs in the press /media. Under Sec. 215 of the
USA PATRIOT Act, as authorized by the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Court NSA may acquire telephone metadata, such as the
telephone numbers dialed and length of calls, but not the content of
calls or the names of the communicants. Under Sec. 702 of the FISA,
with appropriate authorization, NSA may target non-US. persons
reasonably believed to be located outside the United States for
foreign intelligence
purposes. Under the FISC-authorized Sec. 215 authority, NSA cannot
review any metadata unless strict requirements are met, the data may
be queried only when there is a reasonable suspicion, based on speci?c
facts, that a phone number is associated with a foreign terrorist
organization. Likewise, under Sec. 702, there are
strict controls approved by the FISC to help ensure that no US. person

we to provide positive or negative responses to requests such as
yours, our adversaries compilation of the information provided would
reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the
national security.
Therefore, your request is denied because the fact of the existence or
non-existence of responsive records is a currently and properly
classified matter in accordance with Executive Order 13526, as set
forth in Subparagraph of Section 1.4. Thus, your request is denied
pursuant to the first exemption of the FOIA, which provides that the
FOIA does not apply to matters that are specifically authorized
under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in
the interest of national defense or foreign relations and are properly
classified pursuant to such Executive Order.
Moreover, the third exemption of the FOIA provides for the withholding
of information specifically protected from disclosure by statute.
Thus, your request is also denied because the fact of the existence or
non-existence of the information is exempted from disclosure pursuant
to the third exemption. The specific statutes
applicable in this case are: Title 18 US. Code 798; Title 50 US. Code
3024(i); and
Section 6, Public Law 86?36 (50 US. Code 3605).
Paragraph 3.6(a) of Executive Order 13526 specifically authorizes this
type of
response, also known as a Glomar response, to a request made under the

above under the
third exemption of the FOIA would also apply to the denial of the fact

"Our anchor node in Canada - 'maple' - appears to have been offlined
by content oligarchy pressure. Rolling to failover capacity for cluster.
"We'll update today as we learn more; as w/ all cstorm nodes, no data

@_subject: Inquiry re. how to handle Glomar reply to FOIA request 
Hash: SHA1
A while back (specifically, on 6/01/2015) I sent in a FOIA request to
the NSA, requesting, in part, records about myself that "would have
been collected by the NSA under programs authorized by Sections 206
and 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, and Section 6001(a) of the IRTPA,
aforementioned programs and sections which are now expired as of the
date of this request (June 1, 2015)."
In essence, I figured, since the underlying legal authority for the
program had lapsed (however briefly), there was no time like that
present moment to file a FOIA request. And so, I did, not using USPS
mail, but a digital service to ensure it would arrive timely.
My request was actually rather lengthy; that was just a small part,
and I requested any NSA records collected on my person as a result of
use of Sections 206 or 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, or Section 6001(a)
of the IRTPA, from Oct. 26, 2001 to the date of expiration and sunset
of those Sections on midnight May 31st 2015.
(For those who are trying to remember the timeline of what ended up
replacing all that, the USA Freedom Act was signed into law on June 2,
          ~~
The NSA failed to respond within the 20 business days required by
federal law and sent back a "Glomar response."  Technically, as of
today, I only have 49 days left to write and send an appeal (based on
the date when they sent me their Glomar reply).
if you have ever done a SUCCESSful appeal of a Glomar response, please
reply back to me and let me know (give me some advice, etc).  Thanks
in advance.
I've copied a portion of the letter they sent below:
"As you may also be aware, there has been considerable coverage of two
NSA intelligence programs in the press /media. Under Sec. 215 of the
USA PATRIOT Act, as authorized by the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Court NSA may acquire telephone metadata, such as the
telephone numbers dialed and length of calls, but not the content of
calls or the names of the communicants. Under Sec. 702 of the FISA,
with appropriate authorization, NSA may target non-US. persons
reasonably believed to be located outside the United States for
foreign intelligence
purposes. Under the FISC-authorized Sec. 215 authority, NSA cannot
review any metadata unless strict requirements are met, the data may
be queried only when there is a reasonable suspicion, based on speci?c
facts, that a phone number is associated with a foreign terrorist
organization. Likewise, under Sec. 702, there are
strict controls approved by the FISC to help ensure that no US. person
is targeted
and FISC-approved minimizations procedures to ensure the protection of
any information concerning U.S. persons that may be incidentally acquire
Although these two programs have been publicly acknowledged, details
about them remain classified and /or protected from release by
statutes to prevent harm to the national security of the United
States. To the extent that your request seeks any information on you
in relation to NSA intelligence programs, or in relation to any
specific methods or means for conducting the programs, we cannot
acknowledge the existence or non-existence of such information. Any
positive or negative response on a request-by-request basis would
allow our adversaries to accumulate information and draw conclusions
about technical capabilities, sources, and methods. Our adversaries
are likely to evaluate all public responses related to these programs.
we to provide positive or negative responses to requests such as
yours, our adversaries compilation of the information provided would
reasonably be expected to cause exceptionally grave damage to the
national security.
Therefore, your request is denied because the fact of the existence or
non-existence of responsive records is a currently and properly
classified matter in accordance with Executive Order 13526, as set
forth in Subparagraph of Section 1.4. Thus, your request is denied
pursuant to the first exemption of the FOIA, which provides that the
FOIA does not apply to matters that are specifically authorized
under criteria established by an Executive Order to be kept secret in
the interest of national defense or foreign relations and are properly
classified pursuant to such Executive Order.
Moreover, the third exemption of the FOIA provides for the withholding
of information specifically protected from disclosure by statute.
Thus, your request is also denied because the fact of the existence or
non-existence of the information is exempted from disclosure pursuant
to the third exemption. The specific statutes
applicable in this case are: Title 18 US. Code 798; Title 50 US. Code
3024(i); and
Section 6, Public Law 86?36 (50 US. Code 3605).
Paragraph 3.6(a) of Executive Order 13526 specifically authorizes this
type of
response, also known as a Glomar response, to a request made under the
FOIA, PA,
or the mandatory review provisions of this Order. The statutes cited
above under the
third exemption of the FOIA would also apply to the denial of the fact
of the existence
or non-existence of the information if sought under the PA.
The Initial Denial Authority for NSA information is the Associate
Director for
Policy and Records, David J. Sherman. As your request is being denied,
you are
hereby advised of this Agency's appeal procedures. Any person denied
access to
information may file an appeal to the CSS Freedom of Information Act/
Act Appeal Authority. The appeal must be postmarked no later than 60
calendar days

My thoughts on that...
Let's say you were.
"Online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without
going through a financial institution" is indeed what Satoshi
intended, and so you could ask, "but what about all the fiat and how
do you deal with 'the bank problem?'" Well and good... Satoshi was
apparently thinking about that same issue, of a decentralized market
within bitcoin, but it just didn't get finished.
And in February of 2010, it was stripped out of bitcoin.

"subject to either receiving or implementing court orders or NSLs" as
you put it, and in what circumstances would I want to be a "bona fide
contractor?"  I am certain not everyone would want to be one, for
various reasons.

The last update on the IMF's website regarding the currency amounts in
the SDRs (changes in the relative weights of four currencies in the
Special Drawing Rights (SDR) basket) was on December 30, 2010.
  It would seem it is time for an update, though as of Oct. 13, 2015
nothing remarkable seems to have been posted to their site.
I would continue to check non-standard sources for information
developing relating to SDRs (additions or changes in relative weights).
Also note as stated in my twitlonger post
"The basket composition is reviewed every five years by the Executive
Board, or earlier if the IMF finds changed circumstances warrant an
earlier review, to ensure that it reflects the relative importance of
currencies in the world’s trading and financial systems. In the most
recent review (in November 2010), the weights of the currencies in the
SDR basket were revised based on the value of the exports of goods and
services, and the amount of reserves denominated in the respective
currencies that were held by other members of the IMF. These changes
became effective on January 1, 2011. In October 2011, the IMF
Executive Board discussed possible options for broadening the SDR
currency basket. Most directors held the view that the current
criteria for SDR basket selection remained appropriate. The next
review is currently scheduled to take place by the end of 2015."
In other words, if something hasn't happened yet to the SDRs and/or
the relative weight of currencies, it is likely to soon (even though
there are currently no further published meetings of the World Bank
Group and the International Monetary Fund before the end of this year
as shown at
 )

I find it interesting that this "list filtering" is going on at the
same time that the censorship was just initiated in bitcoin-dev (where
emerging mods are making similar claims, but not allowing anyone to
contest the issue; all dissenting replies to the "new policy" go into
a round file or are shunted off to another list).
What we are seeing is the collective dissolving of backbone of online
societies; it may be subconscious or it may even be intentional ~ in
the end, it doesn't matter:  It's happening.
It would not surprise me at all if this e-mail I am writing right now
never is seen by the cypherpunks list at all (or at least, if those
persons who claim to be lords of netiquette, never see it because they
have already decided that I and others should be filtered out).  After
all, my name does appear on the "contributurs-to-be-filtered."
I will soon be removing myself from cypherpunks and bitcoin-dev.  I am
getting tired of being on lists that function more like ggautoblocker
& blocktogether than a forum for freedom of expression.
A reminder, I suppose, is in order, that unless we have fora that
cannot be censored or (easily) filtered (diaspora may be a good
example, and possibly zeronet) then we cannot express ourselves
freely, and the extent of our ideas (and by extension, ourselves)
cannot be said to be free at any level, or in any way, shape, or form.
Free thought requires free expression.

This is generally happening / in process or has happened; you operate

I agree with l.
Essentially what a true BI would do (implemented broadly across the
globe, at least) is to make this society even worse than it already
is, with Cloud Atlas being a good analogy.
It's interesting that few have paused to consider the potential
ramifications of guaranteeing resources for anyone (and I don't think
rehashing examples from Alaska and Saudi Arabia are helpful), but
haven't hesitated to demand that your resources be taken by and
allocated here and there by actors and representatives of dubious
quality so that their plans for social and economic control can be
implemented.  Not to mention that the whole BI enterprise, to the
extent that it is reliant upon governments, is backed by coercion and
use of force.
(To the extent that a BI scheme is non-governmental, and thus not
backed by state threat of violence, imprisonment, etc., for failure to
comply, it would be less objectionable, but still come with a variety
of problems, as there would always be "BI allocators" (e.g. BI policy
or BI core developers, whose decisions affect groups or populations)
and corporate or autonomous actors whose interests would automatically
disregard those of individuals and collectively organized resistance
entities (COREs)).  I consider that these concerns, which I think l.
has properly identified and which I also echo here, apply to
 and other ideas which are similar in concept.
As l. correctly stated, "(BI) will create a future where nobody is
willing to revolt, and the state is in even further reaching control."
I would propose as a better system than BI would be a truly voluntary
system (that does not include BI, but which would allow people to
conduct any sort of transactions they like) where people have the
opportunity to choose what sort of direction they want their resources
to go while also opening the door to helping as many people as
possible in the context of their transactions ~ without relying upon
statism, violence, or use of force.
In the coming days, please see  where there will
soon be some updates relative to this very notion (two use cases of
ABIS ( in BCN), to be in the 1.0.8 graphic wallet
version, currently scheduled for release on Sep 29 or 30, 2015.  (This
version may possibly end up coming out a bit later, as date of release
is estimated, thus keep your eyes peeled.)
