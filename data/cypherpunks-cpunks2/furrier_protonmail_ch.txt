FYI I don't give a flying fuck about BSV and I consider
Faketoshi an idiot and dangerous scammer but I really
enjoyed this guy's breakdown of the BCH problems that
were made apparent after the split. Instead of making
assumptions, you could just ask.

I will disagree with you here. Craig may be an idiot and
the fact that he holds patents makes him dangerous but he
does not have the network effect that the BCH "community" has.
They are all over the place when it comes to fake
libertarianism. I attended Anarchapulco last February, these
guys are FAR MORE DANGEROUS than Faketoshi. Both of these
shitcoins are meant to go down.

I watched you live both in Acapulco and Prague. I don't agree with you
and I don't understand how can people be so naive to think that AP
can actually work. I am against the whole idea, it's the same thing as
cracking down on cryptocurrency or dark markets to fight terrorism.
If you want to fight terrorism, build a society where terrorism is mute.
Similar, if you want to fight politicians, build a society where politics are
either mute or they don't affect our lives so much. Wake up people!
Anyway, to stay on-topic, FUCK BCH

These guys are a joke, trying to capitilize on anarchy to push forward their own agentas. I am disgusted.

Your idea sucks because creating a tool to murder people is not adding anything new to the picture. We already have it and it's called "the goverment". Like any other violence-provocative tool that fits the status quo, the more powerful people are going to take control of it and use it for their own purposes more effectively that you will.
If you want to change the world, create first and foremost human-respecting tools and systems, that are also voluntary, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and provide utility to everyone with as fair access as possible. You wouldn't know but some cryptocurrencies fit as example. Community initiatives around the world that are based within the community and seek alternative ways to reach consensus about things and live a respecting life are moving along those lines.

Don't dilute my message. I am not against protecting private property. AP is not that kind of a tool.
"human-respecting tools and systems, that are also voluntary, decentralized, censorship-resistant, and provide utility to everyone with as fair access as possible."
Tools that do not harm others physically or mentally. Tools that have as low social cost as possible while providing real utility (not Brave New World-style utility).
Human-respecting and voluntary are the most basic aspects of the tools I am advocating for really.
I don't need to. AP is flawed by design and it's never going to be implemented (at best you get something like Augur).

You fail to understand that society is not comprised
only by rational actors and is more complex than a simple
if-else statement. Adding one more thing to spread fear
and death is redundant. On a massive scale this ends up
being at best a PR disaster for the people backing it up.
Besides, you already have general prediction markets already
out there working like Augur as I mentioned earlier.
What are your thoughts on that?

I guess it really is. I shouldn't be amazed that people can be deceptive, despisable, or any other characterization you can think of, no matter their political orientation. I got a glimpse of it during my visit in Acapulco, it's only now that I am starting to realize the world. Excuse my ignorance.

LONG time.
I am not a crypto expert but really how bad is ElGamal 2048bit that you cannot wait for it to change? It's still the default in gpg fwiw. What did you choose instead and what did Loki gain out of it in terms of performance?
What about a mix of staking and DDoSing existing Service Nodes out of the network? At a large scale such an attack would be far more effective than trying to out-stake the network.
Is Loki staffed for such attacks?

Monero fork with premine, governance tax, and 50% funds lockup for "market-based sybil resistance". Good luck, I'll pass.
Also, it wasn't clear from a quick look, do they utilize I2P at the networking layer or did they roll out they own custom solution like Kovri?
