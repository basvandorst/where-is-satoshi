* Eugen Leitl quotes:
Encryption is not a solution to the problem.  The attack on Google
shows that NSA/GCHQ that companies in Western countries and their
employees are legitimate targets for covert operations by their
intelligence services (same for the BND attacks on 1&1 and other
German ISPs, we don't have to single out the Obama administration or
the British here).  Once that is established, those intelligence
services can use all the tools in their portfolio.  This includes
turning employees against their colleagues and their employer, and
things far worse.  Suddenly, passive eavesdropping might not have been
so bad after all.
If you are their target, you lose.  The solution is to make it illegal
that they target you, reign in executive privilege (again, a global
issue) and restore the rule of law.  Obviously, that's a bit more
difficult to turn on some crypto.

Well, for one thing, it removes physical access to machines from
insiders on your end, and in many cases, also direct access to data,
particularly in its bulk form.
With conscious effort and the right resources, you might be able to
come with better security controls than the large service providers,
but right now, most organizations don't have much of an audit trail
for locally run services.  I'm not sure if moving data off premises
actually results in a net loss of control over it.  Note be cause the
service providers are so good at security, but because various factors
conspire to make almost everyone else so bad.

Not all service providers hand you the capability to run arbitrary
code to run VM exploits, so you have to exploit an application bug
first.  (And the application may even run on bare metal.)
Service providers can also provision VMs in such a way that customers
can only attack themselves.

Sure, this is a valid position.  But as we have seen, most
organizations do a poor job of controlling their data in-house.  Right
now, an external service provider can often exceed quite easily the
data controls such organizations can provide, and that alone might can
make it a net win to move the data off premises.
