@_subject: TheCthulhu / CthulhuSec to Cryptome 
I'm curious what everyone thinks. I personally agree with TheCthulhu, but
I'm not a tech or crypto expert.
Original: So today (20th December) I posted a mirror of the Cryptome archive I
received from a close associate of mine (of whom I trust greatly) and was
met by a rather blunt response from the Cryptome administrators regarding
the integrity of the data I host. As many know, I take the subject of
tampering very seriously, and whenever I have leaked or shared data I
strive to provide it with a SHA1 and SHA256 hash at a minimum and also
provide torrents, HTTPS and onion download options. Furthermore, if ever
asked, I would also sign files using my personal PGP key.
[image: 7fc92ced0b91c71560dcdc251bc2a0d9]
The response I received from Cryptome was also either hinting that the
entire research and crypto community is wrong in their conclusions, or that
the Cryptome administrators don’t understand it themselves. The assumption
that cryptography is unbreakable assuming an adversary with unlimited
resources is wrong, even an adversary with limited resources given enough
time can break all cryptography, but that doesn’t make it anything other
than a theoretical matter when put into the actual context. This statement
in particular “Mirroring is tampering. We ask that mirrors be labeled as
tampering.” really also irritates me.
If Cryptome is so concerned that data is being tampered with, I suggest the
1. An MD5, SHA1, SHA256, SHA512 and Whirlpool digest be produced for the
full archive of files in a format such as .zip or .tar.
2. The Cryptome administrators sign all the digests in a single PGP message
to verify the hashes match the archive they produced.
3. The PGP signed message is published with the digests for 14 days on the
Cryptome website, Twitter, my Twitter, my blog and any other source who
wishes to make a copy of it. The 14 day period allows time for any party to
raise concerns if say for example, a third party had stolen the PGP keys to
forge the signature then the Cryptome administrators should have had time
to realise this and either revoke the key or in some way suggest the
archive is not legitimate.
4. After the 14 day period, the archive is made available publicly to which
I shall ensure the hashes can be reproduced on my end, and then I will also
sign the digests message to say it is the one I received and will be
5. A torrent file can be produced which downloads the archive file
specified above; this can also be signed by myself and Cryptome so people
can be sure it is the one we intended to distribute and another layer of
checks by checking the hash once downloaded exists.
6. External parties such as Twitter followings, security researchers etc
cross sign the digests and our keys if they know us sufficiently and trust
the archive is true as it was intended to be distributed.
If the above procedure is not sufficiently secure, then one must operate on
the assumption all technology is unsafe to use. There is the legitimate
concern of hardware tampering and backdoors, which is why open source
software should be used at all stages. However, I would like to draw
attention to the fact that Cryptome offers the full archive for $100 which
is shipped via USB. Therefore, concerns regarding hash or cryptographic
security yet readily shipping USBs seems to me a fairly extreme state of
cognitive dissonance given what is known about attacks like BadUSB and
state physical interception operations.
I call on Cryptome to start allowing proper mirroring of content. Nobody
has called upon Cryptome to host the content themselves or in any way incur
additional costs. What is being asked is that you provide the content with
reasonable security as I propose above, rather than completely ignoring the
matter which will drastically reduce the security and safety of downloads.
If you claim to be all about anti-censorship and transparency, then the
measures I propose above are a good fit. This isn’t about offering 100%
perfect security, this is about offering people the ability to verify the
files in a manner which is reasonable and proportionate to the technology
even state level adversaries currently possess. Even if you disagree on the
security of the cryptographic protocols and measures I describe above, know
that the vast majority of researchers and information security
professionals disagree with you, and that providing it is still far better
than not providing the hashes at all.

Convictions of suspects who refuse to hand over their encrypted passwords
have risen sixfold in four years, potentially blocking police from
examining their electronic devices.
The sharp increase has led to fears that criminals are opting to plead
guilty to encryption offences rather than allow detectives to go through
their computers and phones, which could lead to more serious charges and
longer sentences.

it's been fed to The Times as part of the Snooper's Charter PR push from

A week or two ago, a new Snowden was released that shows information about
a visitor to Cryptome. James Atkinson looked at the slide and concluded
that it was proof of a man in the middle (MITM) attack against Cryptome. He
sent his concerns to John and Deborah who then posted them on Cryptome.org
- I'm doing a little bit of research on the slide and decided to compare
notes with what had already been written about it, including Mr. Atkinson's
post. While examining his remarks about the alleged MITM attack, I noticed
that he seemed to be missing a piece of information that led him to a
faulty conclusion. I've copied and pasted the relevant bits below.

@_subject: The GCHQ Cryptome slide could be a mockup/disinfo 
For the latest version:
A few days ago, a new Snowden slide
released that appeared to show that the GCHQ was monitoring Cryptome in
near-real-time by examining the browsing data of one of the websites'
visitors. John and Deborah of Cryptome later verified that the information
in their slides matched their logs, seemingly verifying the legitimacy of
the slide itself and the information presented about KARMA POLICE.
However, after examining the slide and all the information available, I
realized that it was possible to create the slide (or one like it) with
accurate data without any of the sources cited/assumed/alleged. To
demonstrate this, I put together some comparable information. To respect
the privacy of visitors to Cryptome, the end of each IP address is redacted
and I've provided only a little information about several users instead of
focusing on one user to provide detailed information about.
A few notes before getting into the data:
   1. I didn't receive this information from anyone in law enforcement or
   the intelligence, nor stolen through malicious hacking, social engineering,
   or electronic intrusion. Neither is it the result of surveillance directed
   against Cryptome or its users, or of any other illegal action. It was
   compiled from my legitimate archives.
   2. I have confirmed that the information was available to others by
   locating pre-existing sources online.
   3. This is not meant to accuse any one of forging a document, simply
   pointing out that it can't necessarily be verified by confirming the
   information with Cryptome's server logs.
   4. If the slide *is* a mockup, it could be an internal mockup produced
   by GCHQ, a deliberate piece of disinformation from within or without GCHQ,
   a document altered by Snowden, his friends/"friends" in Russia, or anyone
   else in the chain of custody. Given that Snowden didn't review all of the
   documents he handed over, he might not recognize if one had been altered,
   embellished, forged, or taken out of context prior to publication. Or it
   could be genuine - proving that something could be a fake isn't quite the
   same as proving it's a fake.
   5. If the document was forged, the only group I have reason to suspect
   are the chekist security agencies who have access to both the documents and
   to Snowden.
   6. This was the result of a few rushed hours of work in a single
   afternoon, and thus may contain minor mistakes.
   7. The times should be Eastern/US, but this is an unverified assumption.
   8. These comments are unrelated to my debunking
    of
   the MITM attack against Cryptome which was seemingly implied
    by this slide.

All of this information should be readily verifiable by John and Deborah at
Cryptome, demonstrating that each of the pieces of the slide could have
been created without the benefit of a surveillance program or large budget.
In other words, the guilty knowledge implied by the accuracy of the slide
can imply things other than being guilt of surveillance.

@_subject: Cryptome has been leaking its user logs for over a year 
Let me begin by saying that Cryptome initially denied the leak, then that
the data was stolen, then that the whole thing was a fake "a lie by [a]
spy-newbie." Look at the data itself and examine the multiple sources, then
decide for yourself.
It's important to note that the logs were not just found in the USBs John
Young/Cryptome sent to me, but in the ones sent to "bandmon", who unless
I'm mistaken is coderman
Original post at
If you haven't read why the alleged GCHQ slide showing spying on
Cryptome.org's users could have been made by anyone, I recommend you do so
before reading this
 In
summary, I showed that the information on the slide could have been mocked
up, depsite matching the logs for Cryptome.org. Cryptome has denied the
accuracy of my data, while oddly accusing me of stealing the data, and
leaves me with no alternatives to posting the data online for others to
review and verify.
The data came from Cryptome itself, on a pair of USBs they mailed to me
 Within those USBs were server
logs that include user IPs (spanning several months), .htaccess files, and
a pwd file. After finding the data in the USB Cryptome had just sent me, I
sent an email attempting to verify it hadn't been included as something
extra that was not for public distrubition:
Double checking that the USBs that you sent were prepared as-is and no
different from any other versions, except updated through August 14 2015.
John Young sent back an accusatory email:
deceived by anything digital or analogue or intergalactic. Especially if
authenticated, signed, sealed, shipped through thickets of traps and
contaminants. You know that, though, and are just being humorously baiting
and entrapping. Like Archive.org and Wikipedia and gosh the whole mess
seething with malevolence.
I replied to John:
Don't mean to bait or entrap, but asking questions with too much context
can be leading. I'm not worried about hidden payloads or anything, I want
to make sure that it was (as far as you know) the vanilla version of the
August 2015 archive and you hadn't purposefully included any extra
information for me to peruse before I posted my findings publicly.
John did not respond.
Since John made a point out of the USBs being generated from scratch every
time, I couldn't be sure how long the data had been available. After some
digging, I found a copy of Cryptome's archive apparently uploaded by
coderman[at]gmail.com AKA bandmon. You can find that torrent here
 I
downloaded the torrent to a remote server, unzipped the files and confirmed
there were log files there as well.
It was my strong preference **not** to post this, but since Cryptome has
refused to validate the data, there is no other way to authenticate it than
to release it to the public along with how to find that information in the
Cryptome USBs/CDs and their various mirrors. It was not my intention to
humiliate Cryptome or expose their users, only to demonstrate that the
slide allegedly proving the GCHQ has spied on Cryptome.org could have come
from anywhere. Despite being accurate, the information is not proof of
surveillance or anything nefarious. In short, the alleged GCHQ could have
been produced by GCHQ as an internal mockup, or forged by anyone with
access to an internet connection.
In addition to the links below, you can also download a complete copy of
the dataset from Cryptome  as well as download a .zip of
all of the leaked logs

peruse them in your own time.

If the information is a mockup as Cryptome alleges, then it was created and
distributed by them as part of an insane piece of disinformation designed
to implicate users who are innocent of even visiting Cryptome.org. Far more
likely is that Cryptome has been unaware of these ongoing leaks, refused to
discuss them with me and then attempted to deny their reality.

Most up to date version:
Before reading this, I recommend reading my first post raising concerns
that the alleged GCHQ Cryptome slide from could be a mockup
followed by my disclosure of Cryptome's leaked user logs
After refusing to comment
denying it, accusing it of being disinfo
accusing me of stealing data
accusing me of being a newbie advertising for a spy job
declaring that it was "a campaign" against them
accusing me of faking data
declaring that all logs leak and they pay for the internet
and deleting my post
 to the
Cryptome mailing
list them to the leak, Cryptome has acknowledged that the leaked logs I found
were legitimate. John Young/Cryptome then thanked me, which is apology
enough for all the accusations.
*You were right about AWStats data. Not the stats for Cryptome itself but
for the Cartome sub-directory, for four months, November 2009-February
2010. Included in a full site restoration by ISP NetSol after a full
shutdown in June 2013.The stats have been deleted from the Cryptome
archive. Probably best to not expose visitors' data further but then
nothing can be fully deleted or hidden.Thanks for discovering and reporting
in this.Publish this message if you like.Regards,John*
Immediately after receiving his email, I deleted the stat files from my
website. They were only published to force verification and public
disclosure about the leak. Now that it has been acknowledged, there's no
point in continuing to distribute them. If John provides a new
cryptographically signed Cryptome archive file without those logs, I will
replace the one hosted on Archive.org with the new, sanitized version. Note
that .7z may be best to prevent the archive's deriving process (it makes
individual files within the zip viewable) from making changes to the .zip
file which can cause it to no longer match the hash/cryptographic signature.
What does this mean for the slide that seems to show GCHQ spying on
According to John Young's email, the leak is limited to the Cartome
sub-directory which would not include the Eyeball directory. However, the
time frame matches up perfectly and does include the time period the slide
appears to show. Determining whether or not the leak ever included the
Eyeball directory, and why NetSol's glitch only restored those four months
of the Cartome's stats to the Cryptome archive while trying to view a
random selection of the leaked files on the online server failed, requires
more information from NetSol, Cryptome's ISP. Inquiring about those details
from NetSol and disclosing them falls entirely to John Young and Deborah
Natsios. Presumably, John Young would have disclosed if a similar leak had
been found relating to the Eyeball directory, but it remains possible that
the information might have been deleted from the Cryptome archive prior to
 without
John realizing it had already leaked. More information will be required
before those possibilities can be excluded.
As of the time of this posting (13:45 Eastern October 9, 2015), John Young
has not added anything to his website, twitter account, or mailing lists
disclosing the now confirmed leak to his users. He did remove the graphic
advising his users that the GCHQ was/is allegedly monitoring them.

Just had it pointed out to me "luser" was just internet slang, and not really an insult. Sorry I got a little defensive after that.  For me, "national security" is anything a nation needs to prosper and survive, including national medical care, education, ensuring a healthy job market and that there's infrastructure for everyone to get food, water, information, and from place to place. A lot of my emphasis is on the intelligence aspects of national security, because I started off and got hooked on the subject while reading military history and ex-spook/spy memoirs. I'm fascinated by the economic side of things and think it's under represented, and we need more/better education (at least in the U.S.) that's gauged to a realistic job market and caters to the individual's actual capabilities. I generally don't talk about that part because I only understand it in the broadest terms, and the best I can do is try to listen to the experts in that field and people who are smarter than me. And then there's separating policy from politics...

Imho It's NOT his (Best's) material to decide to post without permission
of the creator. Publicly available or not, at Archive.org.
Cryptome owns the copyright for very little of the material in their
archive. Most of it is public domain items or things that were reprinted
from elsewhere, like news articles. John uses these under fair use, for
educational and research purposes. If John wants to assert a copyright
claim for the items that they did originally produce, then they are welcome
to do so. I'm sure they're capable of it without you.
But I'm guessing that won't convince you, so maybe John Young can. Let's
hear from him, shall we?
"We would have dumped it, the whole thing. Everyone else likes to play this
game: 'What if we harm somebody' or all this kind of crap. Which is
strictly cowardice."
Deborah Natsios said that one of their goals is "To pry open the privatised
domain, the realm of copyright interests, the not-public domain, the
not-public space of corporate interests—but there are private security
guards, global security mercenaries who patrol that boundary."
John then added "We're great advocates of plagiarism and stealing."
I feel like posting the entire archive for educational and research
purposes is entirely fair game. He argues that Citizenfour should be in the
public domain, and I'm sure he'd make that same argument about his archive.
If not, he'll speak up.

@_subject: WHY make a fake GCHQ slide? 
Here's my preliminary list of potential reasons for faking a GCHQ
slide. Not meant to be comprehensive, and not every possibility is
highly likely. Some are included only for completeness, but I'm sure
there are possibilities I missed.
There have been a few incidents already where the slides have been
challenged or at least partially debunked. The German prosecutor found
a lack of evidence that the NSA was illegally monitoring their
government and concluded that the alleged NSA order was a fake.
Snowden has also accused The Independent of attributing slides to him
that he never gave to them.
The why depends on the who. Candidates include:
   - GCHQ
   - Snowden (included for completeness, but least likely. Why fake
this particular slide among many apparently legitimate ones?)
   - Russian chekist agencies
   - Chinese intelligence agencies
   - The Intercept
   - Intel service X
   -
If the GCHQ, then there are a few possible reasons:
   1. Part of a proposal/demo
   2. Disinfo to discourage visitors from going to Cryptome
   3. Disinfo to create paranoia
   4. Disinfo to discredit other slides (Snowden suggests something
like that here    5. Disinfo to convince a FIS (foreign intel service) that their
capabilities are better/more complete than they are (or were better
than they were at the time)
If Snowden:
   1. ???
   2. Makes no sense as an isolated incident, little evidence to the contrary
   3. Would not necessarily recognize a fake slide, since he didn't
examine all of the ones he passed on
If Russian disinfo:
   1. Discredit the GCHQ
   2. Discredit western governments and undermine their intelligence agencies
   3. Inflate the importance of Cryptome prior to attempting to use
them to release disinfo
If Chinese disinfo:
   1. Smear British cyber operations as part of their ongoing cyberwar
with the west and related cognitive warfare
   2. Discredit the GCHQ
   3. Discredit western governments and undermine their intelligence agencies
   4. Inflate the importance of Cryptome prior to attempting to use
them to release disinfo
If The Intercept:
   1. Fame
   2. Money from being paid to publish a fake by any interested party
   3. Financial compensation from media attention as suggested by
If Intel service x:
   1. Any of the above

Thoughts - All good advice in it's own way, but mostly it seems
unnecessary. Aside from copyright and reprint issues, 99% of what's on
Cryptome is not only open source, it's not really objectionable in terms of
hosting it.
TheCthulhu does a great job of distributing large amounts of data, but
that's it's own thing and requires an ongoing budget and infrastructure.
I figure with Archive.org I can distribute 99.9% of material and not worry
about copyright, bandwidth, etc. If it turns out there's a violation I
missed, the item gets taken down - not the entire site or all the uploads.
On the rare occasion that there's something else, I'd rather take whatever
steps are needed to distribute it then rather than try to build my own
independent infrastructure ahead of time.

it forces the issue to be tried in the court of public opinion, where a lot
of information can't be released lest it spoil an investigation or

people since 2013. According to him. (Not the many, many part.)
But if you wanna pull on that thread, someone could easily do the same to
JYA since he's reposted many pieces of copyrighted material on his site,
without reprint permission or proper copyright notice (which cuts off any
fair use claim). GASP Is that proof of this vendetta of which speak?
Not the one John has against me where he's smeared me and accused me of
faking disinfo, I mean the fake one I apparently have against him. (Though
I do admit to being a little bit bitter since he made so many bogus
accusations against me)

You deliberately took that out of context and cut out relevant text. Troll.

and you OH SO CONVENIENTLY left out the very next sentence " If it turns
out there's a violation I missed, the item gets taken down - not the entire
site or all the uploads. " Which referred to Cryptome getting taken down

1. If JYA had been willing to quietly verify that information in the first
place, I wouldn't've had to publish it. Instead, he lied and said I faked

2. I only brought it up because it was relevant to the GCHQ slide, which
John refused to comment on except to tell me in an email to keep going.
3. As John has said, '*What if we harm somebody' or all this kind of crap.

4. The majority of those extra posts about Cryptome or using the word

national security secrets including those necessary for cyber defense

diplomatic relations across the globe.

@_subject: Stealing The Network (novel) free ebook 
If you haven't read it before, someone kindly posted Stealing The Network
series of novels online as a PDF.
"Stealing the Network: How to Own the Box is a unique book in the fiction
department. It combines stories that are false, with technology that is
real. While none of the stories have happened, there is no reason why they
could not. You could argue it provides a road map for criminal hackers, but
I say it does something else; it provides a glimpse into the creative minds
of some of today's best hackers, and even the best hackers will tell you
that the game is a mental one." - from the foreword by Jeff Moss, President
& CEO, BlackHat, Inc.
*Stealing the Network* is a book of science fiction. It's a series of short
stories about characters who gain unauthorized access to equipment and
information, or deny use of those resources to the people who are meant to
have access to them. The characters, though sometimes well described, are
not the stars of these stories. That honor belongs to the tools that the
black-hat hackers use in their attacks, and also to the defensive measures
arrayed against them by the hapless sysadmins who, in this volume, always
lose. Consider this book, with its plentiful detail, the answer to every
pretty but functionally half-baked user interface ever shown in a feature
One can read this book for entertainment, though its writing falls well
short of cyberpunk classics like *Burning Chrome
* and *Snow
Crash *. Its
value is in its explicit references to current technologies--Cisco routers,
OpenSSH, Windows 2000--and specific techniques for hacking them (the heroes
and heroines of this book are always generous with command-history dumps).
The specific detail may open your eyes to weaknesses in your own systems
(or give you some ideas for, ahem, looking around on the network).
Alternately, you can just enjoy the extra realism that the detail adds to
these stories of packetized adventure. *--David Wall*
The stories of the Stealing the Network series entertain in the same way
that "war stories" from fellow hackers and security professionals often
keeps a more intimate audience's interest: by mixing intriguing situations
with juicy technical detail that can serve as a useful take-away. No one
will accuse these books of containing fine literature, but that's not
really the point. The stories are well written enough to keep you wanting
to know what will happen next, while the technical information is as
accurate as you're likely to see in fiction. Segments involving hacking are
written and illustrated with enough attention to detail and length to serve
as introductory educational tutorials for the topics (including web
application hacking, reverse engineering, and wireless security). Most of
these scenarios are believable as parts of larger-scale operations. --McGrew

@_subject: The GCHQ Cryptome slide could be a mockup/disinfo 
For the latest version:
A few days ago, a new Snowden slide
released that appeared to show that the GCHQ was monitoring Cryptome in
near-real-time by examining the browsing data of one of the websites'
visitors. John and Deborah of Cryptome later verified that the information
in their slides matched their logs, seemingly verifying the legitimacy of
the slide itself and the information presented about KARMA POLICE.
However, after examining the slide and all the information available, I
realized that it was possible to create the slide (or one like it) with
accurate data without any of the sources cited/assumed/alleged. To
demonstrate this, I put together some comparable information. To respect
the privacy of visitors to Cryptome, the end of each IP address is redacted
and I've provided only a little information about several users instead of
focusing on one user to provide detailed information about.
A few notes before getting into the data:
   1. I didn't receive this information from anyone in law enforcement or
   the intelligence, nor stolen through malicious hacking, social engineering,
   or electronic intrusion. Neither is it the result of surveillance directed
   against Cryptome or its users, or of any other illegal action. It was
   compiled from my legitimate archives.
   2. I have confirmed that the information was available to others by
   locating pre-existing sources online.
   3. This is not meant to accuse any one of forging a document, simply
   pointing out that it can't necessarily be verified by confirming the
   information with Cryptome's server logs.
   4. If the slide *is* a mockup, it could be an internal mockup produced
   by GCHQ, a deliberate piece of disinformation from within or without GCHQ,
   a document altered by Snowden, his friends/"friends" in Russia, or anyone
   else in the chain of custody. Given that Snowden didn't review all of the
   documents he handed over, he might not recognize if one had been altered,
   embellished, forged, or taken out of context prior to publication. Or it
   could be genuine - proving that something could be a fake isn't quite the
   same as proving it's a fake.
   5. If the document was forged, the only group I have reason to suspect
   are the chekist security agencies who have access to both the documents and
   to Snowden.
   6. This was the result of a few rushed hours of work in a single
   afternoon, and thus may contain minor mistakes.
   7. The times should be Eastern/US, but this is an unverified assumption.
   8. These comments are unrelated to my debunking
    of
   the MITM attack against Cryptome which was seemingly implied
    by this slide.

Let me begin by saying that Cryptome initially denied the leak, then that
the data was stolen, then that the whole thing was a fake "a lie by [a]
spy-newbie." Look at the data itself and examine the multiple sources, then
decide for yourself.
It's important to note that the logs were not just found in the USBs John
Young/Cryptome sent to me, but in the ones sent to "bandmon", who unless
I'm mistaken is coderman at gmail.com
Original post at

before reading this
 In
summary, I showed that the information on the slide could have been mocked
up, depsite matching the logs for Cryptome.org. Cryptome has denied the
accuracy of my data, while oddly accusing me of stealing the data, and
leaves me with no alternatives to posting the data online for others to
review and verify.
The data came from Cryptome itself, on a pair of USBs they mailed to me
 Within those USBs were server
logs that include user IPs (spanning several months), .htaccess files, and
a pwd file. After finding the data in the USB Cryptome had just sent me, I
sent an email attempting to verify it hadn't been included as something
extra that was not for public distrubition:
Double checking that the USBs that you sent were prepared as-is and no
different from any other versions, except updated through August 14 2015.
John Young sent back an accusatory email:
deceived by anything digital or analogue or intergalactic. Especially if
authenticated, signed, sealed, shipped through thickets of traps and
contaminants. You know that, though, and are just being humorously baiting
and entrapping. Like Archive.org and Wikipedia and gosh the whole mess
seething with malevolence.
I replied to John:
Don't mean to bait or entrap, but asking questions with too much context
can be leading. I'm not worried about hidden payloads or anything, I want
to make sure that it was (as far as you know) the vanilla version of the
August 2015 archive and you hadn't purposefully included any extra
information for me to peruse before I posted my findings publicly.
John did not respond.
Since John made a point out of the USBs being generated from scratch every
time, I couldn't be sure how long the data had been available. After some
digging, I found a copy of Cryptome's archive apparently uploaded by
coderman[at]gmail.com AKA bandmon. You can find that torrent here
 I
downloaded the torrent to a remote server, unzipped the files and confirmed
there were log files there as well.
It was my strong preference **not** to post this, but since Cryptome has
refused to validate the data, there is no other way to authenticate it than
to release it to the public along with how to find that information in the
Cryptome USBs/CDs and their various mirrors. It was not my intention to
humiliate Cryptome or expose their users, only to demonstrate that the
slide allegedly proving the GCHQ has spied on Cryptome.org could have come
from anywhere. Despite being accurate, the information is not proof of
surveillance or anything nefarious. In short, the alleged GCHQ could have
been produced by GCHQ as an internal mockup, or forged by anyone with
access to an internet connection.
In addition to the links below, you can also download a complete copy of
the dataset from Cryptome  as well as download a .zip of
all of the leaked logs
 and
peruse them in your own time.

If the information is a mockup as Cryptome alleges, then it was created and
distributed by them as part of an insane piece of disinformation designed
to implicate users who are innocent of even visiting Cryptome.org. Far more
likely is that Cryptome has been unaware of these ongoing leaks, refused to
discuss them with me and then attempted to deny their reality.

Most up to date version:
Before reading this, I recommend reading my first post raising concerns
that the alleged GCHQ Cryptome slide from could be a mockup
followed by my disclosure of Cryptome's leaked user logs
After refusing to comment
denying it, accusing it of being disinfo
accusing me of stealing data
accusing me of being a newbie advertising for a spy job
declaring that it was "a campaign" against them
accusing me of faking data
declaring that all logs leak and they pay for the internet
and deleting my post
 to the
Cryptome mailing
list them to the leak, Cryptome has acknowledged that the leaked logs I found
were legitimate. John Young/Cryptome then thanked me, which is apology
enough for all the accusations.
*You were right about AWStats data. Not the stats for Cryptome itself but
for the Cartome sub-directory, for four months, November 2009-February
2010. Included in a full site restoration by ISP NetSol after a full
shutdown in June 2013.The stats have been deleted from the Cryptome
archive. Probably best to not expose visitors' data further but then
nothing can be fully deleted or hidden.Thanks for discovering and reporting
in this.Publish this message if you like.Regards,John*
Immediately after receiving his email, I deleted the stat files from my
website. They were only published to force verification and public
disclosure about the leak. Now that it has been acknowledged, there's no
point in continuing to distribute them. If John provides a new
cryptographically signed Cryptome archive file without those logs, I will
replace the one hosted on Archive.org with the new, sanitized version. Note
that .7z may be best to prevent the archive's deriving process (it makes
individual files within the zip viewable) from making changes to the .zip
file which can cause it to no longer match the hash/cryptographic signature.
What does this mean for the slide that seems to show GCHQ spying on
According to John Young's email, the leak is limited to the Cartome
sub-directory which would not include the Eyeball directory. However, the
time frame matches up perfectly and does include the time period the slide
appears to show. Determining whether or not the leak ever included the
Eyeball directory, and why NetSol's glitch only restored those four months
of the Cartome's stats to the Cryptome archive while trying to view a
random selection of the leaked files on the online server failed, requires
more information from NetSol, Cryptome's ISP. Inquiring about those details
from NetSol and disclosing them falls entirely to John Young and Deborah
Natsios. Presumably, John Young would have disclosed if a similar leak had
been found relating to the Eyeball directory, but it remains possible that
the information might have been deleted from the Cryptome archive prior to
 without
John realizing it had already leaked. More information will be required
before those possibilities can be excluded.
As of the time of this posting (13:45 Eastern October 9, 2015), John Young
has not added anything to his website, twitter account, or mailing lists
disclosing the now confirmed leak to his users. He did remove the graphic
advising his users that the GCHQ was/is allegedly monitoring them.

Here is Cryptome's full set (so far) of post-admission replies. I'm unable
to make anything consistent out of it.
"Admission of leaked logs" is rather generously overstated of what we
specifically understated.
Me: You understated things? As in, left something(s) out??
Cryptome: Told what was needed to defuse your exaggeration and resist your
demands to auth visitors.
Note that Cryptome doesn't dispute the email that I quoted, which was copy
and pasted in it's entirety.
Rigged and disinfo remain valid. You overstated the disclosure. Leaking is
press exaggeration.
Nothing is ever deleted, that is subterfuge to escape culpability. You
ratted Cryptome visitors. Not the first or last.
*Note that Cryptome is definitely NOT using subterfuge to escape
culpability or advising users of the data leak/breach/compromise/whatever

Still refusing to validate what you faked, rigged and released. And will
not, it's your story, run with it.

Just had it pointed out to me "luser" was just internet slang, and not really an insult. Sorry I got a little defensive after that.  For me, "national security" is anything a nation needs to prosper and survive, including national medical care, education, ensuring a healthy job market and that there's infrastructure for everyone to get food, water, information, and from place to place. A lot of my emphasis is on the intelligence aspects of national security, because I started off and got hooked on the subject while reading military history and ex-spook/spy memoirs. I'm fascinated by the economic side of things and think it's under represented, and we need more/better education (at least in the U.S.) that's gauged to a realistic job market and caters to the individual's actual capabilities. I generally don't talk about that part because I only understand it in the broadest terms, and the best I can do is try to listen to the experts in that field and people who are smarter than me. And then there's separating policy from politics...

Imho It's NOT his (Best's) material to decide to post without permission
of the creator. Publicly available or not, at Archive.org.
Cryptome owns the copyright for very little of the material in their
archive. Most of it is public domain items or things that were reprinted
from elsewhere, like news articles. John uses these under fair use, for
educational and research purposes. If John wants to assert a copyright
claim for the items that they did originally produce, then they are welcome
to do so. I'm sure they're capable of it without you.
But I'm guessing that won't convince you, so maybe John Young can. Let's
hear from him, shall we?
"We would have dumped it, the whole thing. Everyone else likes to play this
game: 'What if we harm somebody' or all this kind of crap. Which is
strictly cowardice."
Deborah Natsios said that one of their goals is "To pry open the privatised
domain, the realm of copyright interests, the not-public domain, the
not-public space of corporate interests—but there are private security
guards, global security mercenaries who patrol that boundary."
John then added "We're great advocates of plagiarism and stealing."
I feel like posting the entire archive for educational and research
purposes is entirely fair game. He argues that Citizenfour should be in the
public domain, and I'm sure he'd make that same argument about his archive.
If not, he'll speak up.

@_subject: WHY make a fake GCHQ slide? 
Here's my preliminary list of potential reasons for faking a GCHQ
slide. Not meant to be comprehensive, and not every possibility is
highly likely. Some are included only for completeness, but I'm sure
there are possibilities I missed.
There have been a few incidents already where the slides have been
challenged or at least partially debunked. The German prosecutor found
a lack of evidence that the NSA was illegally monitoring their
government and concluded that the alleged NSA order was a fake.
Snowden has also accused The Independent of attributing slides to him
that he never gave to them.
The why depends on the who. Candidates include:
   - GCHQ
   - Snowden (included for completeness, but least likely. Why fake
this particular slide among many apparently legitimate ones?)
   - Russian chekist agencies
   - Chinese intelligence agencies
   - The Intercept
   - Intel service X
   -
If the GCHQ, then there are a few possible reasons:
   1. Part of a proposal/demo
   2. Disinfo to discourage visitors from going to Cryptome
   3. Disinfo to create paranoia
   4. Disinfo to discredit other slides (Snowden suggests something
like that here    5. Disinfo to convince a FIS (foreign intel service) that their
capabilities are better/more complete than they are (or were better
than they were at the time)
If Snowden:
   1. ???
   2. Makes no sense as an isolated incident, little evidence to the contrary
   3. Would not necessarily recognize a fake slide, since he didn't
examine all of the ones he passed on
If Russian disinfo:
   1. Discredit the GCHQ
   2. Discredit western governments and undermine their intelligence agencies
   3. Inflate the importance of Cryptome prior to attempting to use
them to release disinfo
If Chinese disinfo:
   1. Smear British cyber operations as part of their ongoing cyberwar
with the west and related cognitive warfare
   2. Discredit the GCHQ
   3. Discredit western governments and undermine their intelligence agencies
   4. Inflate the importance of Cryptome prior to attempting to use
them to release disinfo
If The Intercept:
   1. Fame
   2. Money from being paid to publish a fake by any interested party
   3. Financial compensation from media attention as suggested by
Razer/Rayzer at riseup.net
If Intel service x:
   1. Any of the above

Thoughts - All good advice in it's own way, but mostly it seems

Cryptome is not only open source, it's not really objectionable in terms of
hosting it.
TheCthulhu does a great job of distributing large amounts of data, but
that's it's own thing and requires an ongoing budget and infrastructure.
I figure with Archive.org I can distribute 99.9% of material and not worry
about copyright, bandwidth, etc. If it turns out there's a violation I
missed, the item gets taken down - not the entire site or all the uploads.
On the rare occasion that there's something else, I'd rather take whatever
steps are needed to distribute it then rather than try to build my own
independent infrastructure ahead of time.

Can anyone poke a hole in my logic for any of the possibilities, or come up
with alternate potential faker (again, if it is fake, only the possibility
has been demonstrated) or alternate motives?
"For the lols" is one such possibility as coderman points out. That motive
could be tacked onto most of the potential fakers, but it does also sound
like something a small group of "anons" might do. Unfortunately that
category is so wide (potentially everyone on Earth) and it's a suspicion
based on a stereotype, so I'm not sure if or how to follow-up with it.

As I think I said in the other thread, less specific charges that require
more specific proof and almost never leveled before a trial is set, because
it forces the issue to be tried in the court of public opinion, where a lot
of information can't be released lest it spoil an investigation or
potential trial. There's also the fact that there'd be little to gain at
this point by alleging that the slides are fake since there would be few
people to believe it,
"NSA hasn't said it's fake" doesn't seem like a strong argument -
especially for a non-NSA slide. And again - *Snowden himself* has accused
outlets of releasing slides attributed to him that *he says he did not

he handed over to journalists and couldn't possibly be expected to remember
all the ones he did see well enough to possibly be able to ID this one as
altered or forged. He was only able to argue against the other documents
because he had never been in touch with the outlet releasing them, contrary

I tried to list their motives under the GCHQ/UK motives, who would be more
likely to fake the slide anyway and are the ones alleged of having leaked
documents to the Independent on behalf of JTRIG, are a fairly likely
candidate. Faking a slide like this would be a good way to inspire paranoia
and divide a community, no? It got Cryptome to post a notice on their site
for a week or two, alerting people to the possibility that they'd been
targeted by GCHQ by visiting Cryptome. Sounds like JTRIG-ish paranoia, no?

1. If JYA had been willing to quietly verify that information in the first

John refused to comment on except to tell me in an email to keep going.

If you haven't read it before, someone kindly posted Stealing The Network
series of novels online as a PDF.
"Stealing the Network: How to Own the Box is a unique book in the fiction
department. It combines stories that are false, with technology that is
real. While none of the stories have happened, there is no reason why they
could not. You could argue it provides a road map for criminal hackers, but
I say it does something else; it provides a glimpse into the creative minds
of some of today's best hackers, and even the best hackers will tell you
that the game is a mental one." - from the foreword by Jeff Moss, President
& CEO, BlackHat, Inc.
*Stealing the Network* is a book of science fiction. It's a series of short
stories about characters who gain unauthorized access to equipment and
information, or deny use of those resources to the people who are meant to
have access to them. The characters, though sometimes well described, are
not the stars of these stories. That honor belongs to the tools that the
black-hat hackers use in their attacks, and also to the defensive measures
arrayed against them by the hapless sysadmins who, in this volume, always
lose. Consider this book, with its plentiful detail, the answer to every
pretty but functionally half-baked user interface ever shown in a feature
One can read this book for entertainment, though its writing falls well
short of cyberpunk classics like *Burning Chrome
* and *Snow
Crash *. Its
value is in its explicit references to current technologies--Cisco routers,
OpenSSH, Windows 2000--and specific techniques for hacking them (the heroes
and heroines of this book are always generous with command-history dumps).
The specific detail may open your eyes to weaknesses in your own systems
(or give you some ideas for, ahem, looking around on the network).
Alternately, you can just enjoy the extra realism that the detail adds to
these stories of packetized adventure. *--David Wall*
The stories of the Stealing the Network series entertain in the same way
that "war stories" from fellow hackers and security professionals often
keeps a more intimate audience's interest: by mixing intriguing situations
with juicy technical detail that can serve as a useful take-away. No one
will accuse these books of containing fine literature, but that's not
really the point. The stories are well written enough to keep you wanting
to know what will happen next, while the technical information is as
accurate as you're likely to see in fiction. Segments involving hacking are
written and illustrated with enough attention to detail and length to serve
as introductory educational tutorials for the topics (including web
application hacking, reverse engineering, and wireless security). Most of
these scenarios are believable as parts of larger-scale operations. --McGrew

@_subject: The GCHQ Cryptome slide could be a mockup/disinfo 
For the latest version:
A few days ago, a new Snowden slide
released that appeared to show that the GCHQ was monitoring Cryptome in
near-real-time by examining the browsing data of one of the websites'
visitors. John and Deborah of Cryptome later verified that the information
in their slides matched their logs, seemingly verifying the legitimacy of
the slide itself and the information presented about KARMA POLICE.
However, after examining the slide and all the information available, I
realized that it was possible to create the slide (or one like it) with
accurate data without any of the sources cited/assumed/alleged. To
demonstrate this, I put together some comparable information. To respect
the privacy of visitors to Cryptome, the end of each IP address is redacted
and I've provided only a little information about several users instead of
focusing on one user to provide detailed information about.
A few notes before getting into the data:
   1. I didn't receive this information from anyone in law enforcement or
   the intelligence, nor stolen through malicious hacking, social engineering,
   or electronic intrusion. Neither is it the result of surveillance directed
   against Cryptome or its users, or of any other illegal action. It was
   compiled from my legitimate archives.
   2. I have confirmed that the information was available to others by
   locating pre-existing sources online.
   3. This is not meant to accuse any one of forging a document, simply
   pointing out that it can't necessarily be verified by confirming the

   4. If the slide *is* a mockup, it could be an internal mockup produced
   by GCHQ, a deliberate piece of disinformation from within or without GCHQ,
   a document altered by Snowden, his friends/"friends" in Russia, or anyone
   else in the chain of custody. Given that Snowden didn't review all of the
   documents he handed over, he might not recognize if one had been altered,
   embellished, forged, or taken out of context prior to publication. Or it
   could be genuine - proving that something could be a fake isn't quite the
   same as proving it's a fake.
   5. If the document was forged, the only group I have reason to suspect
   are the chekist security agencies who have access to both the documents and
   to Snowden.

@_subject: Cryptome has been leaking its user logs for over a year 
Let me begin by saying that Cryptome initially denied the leak, then that
the data was stolen, then that the whole thing was a fake "a lie by [a]
spy-newbie." Look at the data itself and examine the multiple sources, then
decide for yourself.
It's important to note that the logs were not just found in the USBs John
Young/Cryptome sent to me, but in the ones sent to "bandmon", who unless
I'm mistaken is coderman at gmail.com
Original post at
If you haven't read why the alleged GCHQ slide showing spying on
Cryptome.org's users could have been made by anyone, I recommend you do so
before reading this
 In
summary, I showed that the information on the slide could have been mocked
up, depsite matching the logs for Cryptome.org. Cryptome has denied the
accuracy of my data, while oddly accusing me of stealing the data, and
leaves me with no alternatives to posting the data online for others to
review and verify.
The data came from Cryptome itself, on a pair of USBs they mailed to me
 Within those USBs were server
logs that include user IPs (spanning several months), .htaccess files, and
a pwd file. After finding the data in the USB Cryptome had just sent me, I
sent an email attempting to verify it hadn't been included as something
extra that was not for public distrubition:
Double checking that the USBs that you sent were prepared as-is and no
different from any other versions, except updated through August 14 2015.
John Young sent back an accusatory email:
deceived by anything digital or analogue or intergalactic. Especially if
authenticated, signed, sealed, shipped through thickets of traps and
contaminants. You know that, though, and are just being humorously baiting
and entrapping. Like Archive.org and Wikipedia and gosh the whole mess
seething with malevolence.
I replied to John:
Don't mean to bait or entrap, but asking questions with too much context
can be leading. I'm not worried about hidden payloads or anything, I want
to make sure that it was (as far as you know) the vanilla version of the
August 2015 archive and you hadn't purposefully included any extra
information for me to peruse before I posted my findings publicly.
John did not respond.
Since John made a point out of the USBs being generated from scratch every
time, I couldn't be sure how long the data had been available. After some
digging, I found a copy of Cryptome's archive apparently uploaded by
coderman[at]gmail.com AKA bandmon. You can find that torrent here
 I
downloaded the torrent to a remote server, unzipped the files and confirmed
there were log files there as well.
It was my strong preference **not** to post this, but since Cryptome has
refused to validate the data, there is no other way to authenticate it than
to release it to the public along with how to find that information in the
Cryptome USBs/CDs and their various mirrors. It was not my intention to
humiliate Cryptome or expose their users, only to demonstrate that the
slide allegedly proving the GCHQ has spied on Cryptome.org could have come
from anywhere. Despite being accurate, the information is not proof of
surveillance or anything nefarious. In short, the alleged GCHQ could have
been produced by GCHQ as an internal mockup, or forged by anyone with
access to an internet connection.
In addition to the links below, you can also download a complete copy of
the dataset from Cryptome  as well as download a .zip of
all of the leaked logs
 and
peruse them in your own time.
Cryptome's leaked logs:

If the information is a mockup as Cryptome alleges, then it was created and
distributed by them as part of an insane piece of disinformation designed
to implicate users who are innocent of even visiting Cryptome.org. Far more
likely is that Cryptome has been unaware of these ongoing leaks, refused to
discuss them with me and then attempted to deny their reality.

Most up to date version:
Before reading this, I recommend reading my first post raising concerns
that the alleged GCHQ Cryptome slide from could be a mockup
followed by my disclosure of Cryptome's leaked user logs
After refusing to comment
denying it, accusing it of being disinfo
accusing me of stealing data
accusing me of being a newbie advertising for a spy job
declaring that it was "a campaign" against them
accusing me of faking data
declaring that all logs leak and they pay for the internet
and deleting my post
 to the
Cryptome mailing
list them to the leak, Cryptome has acknowledged that the leaked logs I found
were legitimate. John Young/Cryptome then thanked me, which is apology
enough for all the accusations.
*You were right about AWStats data. Not the stats for Cryptome itself but
for the Cartome sub-directory, for four months, November 2009-February
2010. Included in a full site restoration by ISP NetSol after a full
shutdown in June 2013.The stats have been deleted from the Cryptome
archive. Probably best to not expose visitors' data further but then
nothing can be fully deleted or hidden.Thanks for discovering and reporting
in this.Publish this message if you like.Regards,John*
Immediately after receiving his email, I deleted the stat files from my
website. They were only published to force verification and public
disclosure about the leak. Now that it has been acknowledged, there's no
point in continuing to distribute them. If John provides a new
cryptographically signed Cryptome archive file without those logs, I will
replace the one hosted on Archive.org with the new, sanitized version. Note
that .7z may be best to prevent the archive's deriving process (it makes
individual files within the zip viewable) from making changes to the .zip
file which can cause it to no longer match the hash/cryptographic signature.
What does this mean for the slide that seems to show GCHQ spying on
According to John Young's email, the leak is limited to the Cartome
sub-directory which would not include the Eyeball directory. However, the
time frame matches up perfectly and does include the time period the slide
appears to show. Determining whether or not the leak ever included the
Eyeball directory, and why NetSol's glitch only restored those four months
of the Cartome's stats to the Cryptome archive while trying to view a
random selection of the leaked files on the online server failed, requires
more information from NetSol, Cryptome's ISP. Inquiring about those details
from NetSol and disclosing them falls entirely to John Young and Deborah
Natsios. Presumably, John Young would have disclosed if a similar leak had
been found relating to the Eyeball directory, but it remains possible that
the information might have been deleted from the Cryptome archive prior to
 without
John realizing it had already leaked. More information will be required
before those possibilities can be excluded.
As of the time of this posting (13:45 Eastern October 9, 2015), John Young
has not added anything to his website, twitter account, or mailing lists
disclosing the now confirmed leak to his users. He did remove the graphic
advising his users that the GCHQ was/is allegedly monitoring them.

Here is Cryptome's full set (so far) of post-admission replies. I'm unable

"Admission of leaked logs" is rather generously overstated of what we
specifically understated.
Me: You understated things? As in, left something(s) out??
Cryptome: Told what was needed to defuse your exaggeration and resist your
demands to auth visitors.
Note that Cryptome doesn't dispute the email that I quoted, which was copy
and pasted in it's entirety.
Rigged and disinfo remain valid. You overstated the disclosure. Leaking is
press exaggeration.
Nothing is ever deleted, that is subterfuge to escape culpability. You
ratted Cryptome visitors. Not the first or last.
*Note that Cryptome is definitely NOT using subterfuge to escape
culpability or advising users of the data leak/breach/compromise/whatever

Just had it pointed out to me "luser" was just internet slang, and not really an insult. Sorry I got a little defensive after that.  For me, "national security" is anything a nation needs to prosper and survive, including national medical care, education, ensuring a healthy job market and that there's infrastructure for everyone to get food, water, information, and from place to place. A lot of my emphasis is on the intelligence aspects of national security, because I started off and got hooked on the subject while reading military history and ex-spook/spy memoirs. I'm fascinated by the economic side of things and think it's under represented, and we need more/better education (at least in the U.S.) that's gauged to a realistic job market and caters to the individual's actual capabilities. I generally don't talk about that part because I only understand it in the broadest terms, and the best I can do is try to listen to the experts in that field and people who are smarter than me. And then there's separating policy from politics...

Imho It's NOT his (Best's) material to decide to post without permission
of the creator. Publicly available or not, at Archive.org.
Cryptome owns the copyright for very little of the material in their
archive. Most of it is public domain items or things that were reprinted
from elsewhere, like news articles. John uses these under fair use, for
educational and research purposes. If John wants to assert a copyright
claim for the items that they did originally produce, then they are welcome
to do so. I'm sure they're capable of it without you.
But I'm guessing that won't convince you, so maybe John Young can. Let's
hear from him, shall we?
"We would have dumped it, the whole thing. Everyone else likes to play this
game: 'What if we harm somebody' or all this kind of crap. Which is
strictly cowardice."
Deborah Natsios said that one of their goals is "To pry open the privatised
domain, the realm of copyright interests, the not-public domain, the
not-public space of corporate interests—but there are private security
guards, global security mercenaries who patrol that boundary."
John then added "We're great advocates of plagiarism and stealing."
I feel like posting the entire archive for educational and research
purposes is entirely fair game. He argues that Citizenfour should be in the
public domain, and I'm sure he'd make that same argument about his archive.
If not, he'll speak up.

@_subject: WHY make a fake GCHQ slide? 
Here's my preliminary list of potential reasons for faking a GCHQ
slide. Not meant to be comprehensive, and not every possibility is
highly likely. Some are included only for completeness, but I'm sure
there are possibilities I missed.
There have been a few incidents already where the slides have been
challenged or at least partially debunked. The German prosecutor found
a lack of evidence that the NSA was illegally monitoring their
government and concluded that the alleged NSA order was a fake.
Snowden has also accused The Independent of attributing slides to him
that he never gave to them.
The why depends on the who. Candidates include:
   - GCHQ
   - Snowden (included for completeness, but least likely. Why fake
this particular slide among many apparently legitimate ones?)
   - Russian chekist agencies
   - Chinese intelligence agencies
   - The Intercept
   - Intel service X
   -
If the GCHQ, then there are a few possible reasons:
   1. Part of a proposal/demo
   2. Disinfo to discourage visitors from going to Cryptome
   3. Disinfo to create paranoia
   4. Disinfo to discredit other slides (Snowden suggests something
like that here    5. Disinfo to convince a FIS (foreign intel service) that their
capabilities are better/more complete than they are (or were better
than they were at the time)
If Snowden:
   1. ???
   2. Makes no sense as an isolated incident, little evidence to the contrary
   3. Would not necessarily recognize a fake slide, since he didn't
examine all of the ones he passed on
If Russian disinfo:
   1. Discredit the GCHQ
   2. Discredit western governments and undermine their intelligence agencies
   3. Inflate the importance of Cryptome prior to attempting to use
them to release disinfo
If Chinese disinfo:
   1. Smear British cyber operations as part of their ongoing cyberwar
with the west and related cognitive warfare
   2. Discredit the GCHQ
   3. Discredit western governments and undermine their intelligence agencies
   4. Inflate the importance of Cryptome prior to attempting to use
them to release disinfo
If The Intercept:
   1. Fame
   2. Money from being paid to publish a fake by any interested party
   3. Financial compensation from media attention as suggested by
Razer/Rayzer at riseup.net
If Intel service x:
   1. Any of the above

Thoughts - All good advice in it's own way, but mostly it seems
unnecessary. Aside from copyright and reprint issues, 99% of what's on
Cryptome is not only open source, it's not really objectionable in terms of
hosting it.
TheCthulhu does a great job of distributing large amounts of data, but
that's it's own thing and requires an ongoing budget and infrastructure.
I figure with Archive.org I can distribute 99.9% of material and not worry
about copyright, bandwidth, etc. If it turns out there's a violation I
missed, the item gets taken down - not the entire site or all the uploads.
On the rare occasion that there's something else, I'd rather take whatever
steps are needed to distribute it then rather than try to build my own
independent infrastructure ahead of time.

it forces the issue to be tried in the court of public opinion, where a lot

While examining the cryptome.wikileaks.org, I took a look at their version

released via TOR and torrents over a year ago.

It also references Cryptome's old kickstarter.
Does this mean that Wikileaks is hosting some of the files (older than June
2, 2014?) and using a redirect for newer files?
*The awstats which were included in that release don't show up in the
search through Wikileaks, but interestingly a few now deleted tweets from
Cryptome do. They may be storing some of the tweets.

that instance was a total coincidence but the research assistants for the

@_subject: Stealing The Network (novel) free ebook 
If you haven't read it before, someone kindly posted Stealing The Network
series of novels online as a PDF.
"Stealing the Network: How to Own the Box is a unique book in the fiction
department. It combines stories that are false, with technology that is
real. While none of the stories have happened, there is no reason why they
could not. You could argue it provides a road map for criminal hackers, but
I say it does something else; it provides a glimpse into the creative minds
of some of today's best hackers, and even the best hackers will tell you
that the game is a mental one." - from the foreword by Jeff Moss, President
& CEO, BlackHat, Inc.
*Stealing the Network* is a book of science fiction. It's a series of short
stories about characters who gain unauthorized access to equipment and
information, or deny use of those resources to the people who are meant to
have access to them. The characters, though sometimes well described, are
not the stars of these stories. That honor belongs to the tools that the
black-hat hackers use in their attacks, and also to the defensive measures
arrayed against them by the hapless sysadmins who, in this volume, always
lose. Consider this book, with its plentiful detail, the answer to every
pretty but functionally half-baked user interface ever shown in a feature
One can read this book for entertainment, though its writing falls well
short of cyberpunk classics like *Burning Chrome
* and *Snow
Crash *. Its
value is in its explicit references to current technologies--Cisco routers,
OpenSSH, Windows 2000--and specific techniques for hacking them (the heroes
and heroines of this book are always generous with command-history dumps).
The specific detail may open your eyes to weaknesses in your own systems
(or give you some ideas for, ahem, looking around on the network).
Alternately, you can just enjoy the extra realism that the detail adds to
these stories of packetized adventure. *--David Wall*
The stories of the Stealing the Network series entertain in the same way
that "war stories" from fellow hackers and security professionals often
keeps a more intimate audience's interest: by mixing intriguing situations
with juicy technical detail that can serve as a useful take-away. No one
will accuse these books of containing fine literature, but that's not
really the point. The stories are well written enough to keep you wanting
to know what will happen next, while the technical information is as
accurate as you're likely to see in fiction. Segments involving hacking are
written and illustrated with enough attention to detail and length to serve
as introductory educational tutorials for the topics (including web
application hacking, reverse engineering, and wireless security). Most of
these scenarios are believable as parts of larger-scale operations. --McGrew

Millions of pages of CIA documents are stored in Room 3000. The CIA Records
Search Tool (CREST), the agency's database of declassified intelligence
files, is only accessible via four computers in the National Archives
Building in College Park, MD, and contains everything from Cold War
intelligence, research and development files, to images.
Now one activist is aiming to get those documents more readily available to
anyone who is interested in them, by methodically printing, scanning, and
then archiving them on the internet.
“It boils down to freeing information and getting as much of it as possible
into the hands of the public, not to mention journalists, researchers and

The scanner won't be going to the National Archives. Documents are printed

printers, then taken from the archive after being checked and placed in one
of the green security bags. (I've done this several times, including today.

The flatbed scanner restriction is for scanning original archive materials
only, since the risk of damaging them is genuinely unacceptable. (The

Copied below (some/all of the formatting will likely be stripped by the

*Forensic Spotlight*
*Digital Forensic Examination: A Case Study*
By John McHenry and Michael Gorn, M.S.
A 2014 investigation into the distribution of child pornography revealed
the identity and geographic location of a suspect. The case expanded to
include domestic and international elements and collaboration by multiple
law enforcement agencies associated with the Internet Crimes Against
Children (ICAC) task force.
A Sarasota, Florida, municipality was tasked with the local investigation,
which led to the January 2015 arrest of a 34-year-old male. The city
requested the assistance of Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office Intelligence
Unit digital forensics experts to complete a comprehensive examination of
the devices seized during the arrest. The information presented with the
case indicated that the suspect was a local commercial and residential
Among the items presented for digital forensic examination was a cell phone
with a 13+ megapixel camera capable of capturing high definition images.
Many of the images captured by and extracted from the phone contained a
pixel resolution of 2322 x 4128 and metadata directly linking the photos to
the device. During the forensic examination, experts collected evidence to
support charges for the possession, manufacture, and transmission of child
pornography. The pictures included adult hands and pornographic images of
[image: Open quotes]
As detectives further enlarged the pictures on the monitor, a high level of
detail was witnessed within the fingerprints.
In April 2015 Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office detectives, using a 42” high
definition monitor, observed a paint-like substance on the hands in the
photos, which correlated to the suspect’s trade as a painter. As detectives
further enlarged the pictures on the monitor, a high level of detail was
witnessed within the fingerprints. After removing the pornographic details,
investigators submitted five images to the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office
Fingerprint Unit with a request for analysis. The argument of “some other
guy did it” is a common defense in the field of digital forensics because
it often is not possible to determine who actually used a device.
Therefore, the potential of a fingerprint association becomes vitally
*Print Examination*
A latent print examiner (LPE) received the case and examined the ridge
detail present in the images. In one image (figure 1), detail was of
sufficient quality and quantity to be identified as the left middle finger
of the suspect when compared with fingerprints taken during the jail
booking process. Due to the digital image being a reversal of the print on
the booking card, the print as visualized in the phone image had to be
*Figure 1*
[image: FS figure 1.jpg]
This first identification was enough for the state attorney’s office to
request a motion to compel the offender to provide major case prints. The
office granted the motion, and the LPE went to the courtroom to take the
set of prints.
Further examination of two digital images from the phone led to
identification of the left thumb of the suspect on the major case prints.
These images were inverted for comparison. A second qualified LPE verified
all identifications.
Prior to trial the defense counsel successfully argued to have the
suspect’s confession suppressed. No faces were present in any images. This
made the fingerprint evidence extremely valuable because the suspect could
argue that a partner who had the same first name shared a common e-mail
account, and the fingers depicted in the images were from the partner. The
subject also could claim guilt for possession, distribution, and
transmission of child pornography, but not the manufacture.
The identifications made by the latent print examiners proved that the
suspect was involved directly in the acts as witnessed in the images
recovered by the digital forensic detectives. This conclusive evidence was
one piece of the forensic puzzle that assisted the jury in finding the
offender guilty of 26 charges, including capital sexual battery;
molestation; and possession, distribution, and transmission of child
pornography. The offender faces up to life in prison.

@_subject: New Lies For Old / The Perestroika Deception 
If you've never read them or even heard of them, I highly recommend them.
Whether you dismiss him or think there's something worth listening, the
Nosenko / Golitsyn permanently affair changed U.S. intelligence (not to
mention the JFK and Watergate connections).
New Lies For Old: The Perestroika Deception:
In his book Wedge - The Secret War between the FBI and CIA (Knopf, 1994),
Mark Riebling stated that of 194 predictions made in New Lies For Old, 139
had been fulfilled by 1993, 9 seemed 'clearly wrong', and the other 46 were
'not soon falsifiable'.
Golitsyn was a figure of significant controversy in the Western
intelligence community. The military writer General Sir John Hackett, and
the former CIA counter-intelligence director James Angleton identified
Golitsyn as "the most valuable defector ever to reach the West". However,
the official historian for MI5, Christopher Andrew, described him as an
"unreliable conspiracy theorist". Andrew believes that although
intelligence data provided by Golitsyn were reliable, some of his global
political assessments of the Soviet and KGB strategy are questionable.
New Lies for Old
In 1984, Golitsyn published the book *New Lies For Old*, wherein he warned
about a long-term deception  strategy
of seeming retreat from hard-line Communism designed to lull the West into
a false sense of security, and finally economically cripple and
diplomatically isolate the United States
. Among other things, Golitsyn
"The "liberalization" would be spectacular and impressive. Formal
pronouncements might be made about a reduction in the communist party's
role: its monopoly would be apparently curtailed. An ostensible separation
of powers between the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary might
be introduced. The Supreme Soviet would be given greater apparent power,
and the president of the Soviet Union and the first secretary of the party
might well be separated. The KGB would be "reformed." Dissidents at home
would be amnestied; those in exile abroad would be allowed to return, and
some would take up positions of leadership in government.Sakharov might be
included in some capacity in the government or allowed to teach abroad. The
creative arts and cultural and scientific organizations, such as the
writers' unions and Academy of Sciences, would become apparently more
independent, as would the trade unions. Political clubs would be opened to
nonmembers of the communist party. Leading dissidents might form one or
more alternative political parties.There would be greater freedom for
Soviet citizens to travel. Western and Unitized Nations observers would be
invited to the Soviet Union to witness the reforms in action."
Angleton and Golitsyn reportedly sought the assistance of William F.
Buckley, Jr.  (who
once worked for the CIA) in writing *New Lies for Old*. Buckley refused but
later went on to write a novel about Angleton, *Spytime: The Undoing of
James Jesus Angleton*.
The Perestroika Deception
In 1995 he published a book containing purported memoranda attributed to
Golitsyn entitled *The Perestroika
 Deception* which claimed:
   - "The [Soviet] strategists are concealing the secret coordination that
   exists and will continue between Moscow and the 'nationalist' leaders of
   [the] 'independent' republics."
   - "The power of the KGB remains as great as ever... Talk of cosmetic
   changes in the KGB and its supervision is deliberately publicized to
   support the myth of 'democratization' of the Soviet political system."
   - "Scratch these new, instant Soviet 'democrats,' 'anti-Communists,' and
   'nationalists' who have sprouted out of nowhere, and underneath will be
   found secret Party members or KGB agents."

@_subject: Former Spy Chief Reveals Secret Strategies for Undermining Freedom, 
Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa, the highest-ranking intelligence official ever
to defect from the Soviet Bloc, served as acting chief of communist
Romania's espionage service and top adviser to President Nicolae Ceausescu.
The highest-ranking Soviet bloc intelligence official ever to defect to the
West, Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa is at it again. Today, still living
undercover in the United States, the man credited by the CIA as the only
person in the Western world who single-handedly demolished an entire enemy
espionage service--the one he himself managed--takes aim at an even bigger
target: the exotic, widely misunderstood but still astonishingly
influential realm of the Russian-born "science" of disinformation.Indeed,
within these pages, Pacepa, along with his co-author, historian and law
professor Ronald Rychlak, expose some of the most consequential yet largely
unknown disinformation campaigns of our lifetime.
Discover answers to many crucial questions of the modern era:
   - Why, during the last two generations, has so much of the Western world
   turned against its founding faith, Christianity?
   - Why have radical Islam, jihad and terrorism burst aflame after a long
   period of apparent quiescence?
   - Why is naked Marxism increasingly manifesting in America and its NATO
   allies?
   - What really happened to Russia after the Berlin Wall came down?
Like the solution to a giant jigsaw puzzle lacking one crucial piece,
Disinformation authoritatively provides the missing dimension that makes
the chaos of the modern world finally understandable. By its very nature, a
disinformation campaign can work only if the seemingly independent Western
press accepts intentionally fabricated lies and presents them to the public
as truth. Thus, Pacepa and Rychlak also document how the U.S. "mainstream
media's" enduring sympathy for all things liberal-left has made it
vulnerable to--indeed, the prime carrier of--civilization-transforming
campaigns of lying, defamation and historical revisionism that turn reality
on its head.
   - How destroying the reputation of good leaders has been developed into
   a high art and science.
   - How Pope Pius XII --a generation ago the world's most high-profile
   Christian leader, who personally saved countless Jews from Hitler's
   Holocaust--was transformed, through the magic of disinformation, into a
   Nazi sympathizer.
   - How Christianity and Judaism have been targeted for constant
   denigration and defamation through an ongoing campaign of disinformation.
   - How the Soviet bloc planted 4,000 agents of influence in the Islamic
   world, armed with hundreds of thousands of copies of the most infamous
   anti-Semitic book in history, to fan the flames of ancient Arab resentments
   against the U.S. and Israel and sow the seeds of anti-Semitism that would
   later bloom in the form of violence and terror toward Jews and Christians.
   - How the defamatory attacks on American soldiers John Kerry made before
   Congress upon his return from Vietnam--charges later discredited and
   repudiated--were identical to a contemporaneous KGB disinformation campaign
   concocted to turn Americans against their own leaders.
   - How supposedly respectable institutions like the World Council of
   Churches have long been infiltrated and controlled by Russian intelligence.
   - How much of the world came to believe that the U.S. government itself
   masterminded the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
   - How the Soviet Union has been transformed into the first intelligence
   dictatorship in history.
   - How disinformation is still very much alive in the age of Obama,
   remaining a powerful engine in the ongoing socialist transformation of
   America.
All this and much more is meticulously documented in Disinformation, with
the credibility of an eyewitness who was not only there, but actively
involved as a Soviet bloc spy chief--who, thanks to a crisis of conscience,
"left the dark side" and came to America to help shine a light on the
greatest source of political evil of the modern age.

@_subject: Drug Lords and the Quiet Man Who Became the CIA's Master Killer 
Excerpts from the Kindle edition, description from Amazon.com.
In “How to Get Away with Murder in America,” Evan Wright reveals the story
of Enrique “Ricky” Prado, an alleged killer for a major Miami drug
trafficker who was recruited into the CIA. Despite a grand jury subpoena
and a mountain of evidence unearthed by a federal task force, Prado was
promoted into the agency’s highest echelons and charged with implementing
some of the country’s most sensitive post-9/11 counterterrorist operations,
including the agency’s secret “targeted assassination unit.” All while
staying in close touch with his cocaine-trafficking boss and, evidence
suggests, taking part in additional killings for him.
After Prado retired in 2004 at the rank of SIS-2—the CIA equivalent of a
two-star general—he moved to a senior position at Blackwater, the private
military contractor, where he continued to run the same, now-outsourced
“death squad.” Contrary to government assurances that it was never actually
activated, Wright reveals testimony from one of the Blackwater assassins
that Prado’s unit was indeed carrying out assigned killings. As a former
military intelligence officer told Wright in 2011, “Private contractors are
whacking people like crazy over in Afghanistan for the CIA.”
Unfortunately, while this book contains many tantalizing seeds it doesn't
provide context for many events. Further muddying the book's account is the
fact that it follows the investigation chronologically, and not the events
being investigated. Additional research is needed to build on what this
book began.

@_subject: FBI on MLK Jr. 
It didn't take as long as I thought it might to put the info together.
In December 1993, Lloyd Jowers appeared on ABC's Prime Time Live and
related the details of an alleged conspiracy involving the Mafia and the
U.S. government to kill King. According to Jowers, James Earl Ray was a
scapegoat, and was not responsible for the assassination. Jowers said that
he hired Memphis police Lieutenant Earl Clark to fire the fatal shot. The
existence of such a conspiracy, and Jowers' involvement, was supported in
the verdict of a 1998 court case which was brought against Jowers by the
King family. The allegations and the finding of the Memphis jury were later
rejected by the United States Department of Justice in 2000.
In 1998, the King family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Jowers and
"other unknown co-conspirators" for the murder of King. The King family was
represented by attorney William Pepper, who had previously served as the
attorney of James Earl Ray, King's formerly accused assassin. After four
weeks of testimony and over 70 witnesses in a civil trial in Memphis,
Tennessee, twelve jurors reached a unanimous verdict on December 8, 1999
after about an hour of deliberations that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was
assassinated as a result of a conspiracy which also involved "others,
including governmental agencies."
Mrs. Coretta Scott King commented on the verdict, saying, “There is
abundant evidence of a major high level conspiracy in the assassination of
my husband, Martin Luther King, Jr. And the civil court's unanimous verdict
has validated our belief. I wholeheartedly applaud the verdict of the jury
and I feel that justice has been well served in their deliberations. This
verdict is not only a great victory for my family, but also a great victory
for America."

Absolutely. It's a shitty situation for some counterintelligence folks
since it boils down to something that only hurts their Intel Community and
helps the opposition but there's nothing inherently wrong/bad with the
effort and the people behind it might not even be indirectly sponsored by a
foreign intelligence service.
This is a serious question for those of you who swore an oath to uphold
I personally think that in most cases it's better to make a difference from
inside than outside. There are exceptions and situations where that's
impossible, of course, and sometimes an external shock to the system is
necessary to instigate change... but it's always uncontrolled. I want
people to stick around to fix things, not exit and point out the problems.
That's a very personal choice with a lot of variables though, so I respect
people that come to a different conclusion.
If you do not wish to exit, then make it so others can, easily, simply,
100% agree, with the additional thought that the exit interviews should try
to find a way to 1. solve the problem and 2. hopefully retain the employee.
Or, at the very least, what secrets can you gain from the other side(s)
And now we get into the CI nightmare again. It can be a ripe field for
recruiting, theoretically. At least one study (I think more, but can't be
sure off the top of my head) has shown that for people who were current and
active personnel at the time, ideology played a relatively low motivation
in betrayals and leaks (to the press or foreign agencies). Usually it's
money or revenge, both of which could certainly play a role for people
exiting the service.

Copied below (some/all of the formatting will likely be stripped by the

*Forensic Spotlight*
*Digital Forensic Examination: A Case Study*
By John McHenry and Michael Gorn, M.S.
A 2014 investigation into the distribution of child pornography revealed
the identity and geographic location of a suspect. The case expanded to
include domestic and international elements and collaboration by multiple
law enforcement agencies associated with the Internet Crimes Against
Children (ICAC) task force.
A Sarasota, Florida, municipality was tasked with the local investigation,
which led to the January 2015 arrest of a 34-year-old male. The city
requested the assistance of Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office Intelligence
Unit digital forensics experts to complete a comprehensive examination of
the devices seized during the arrest. The information presented with the
case indicated that the suspect was a local commercial and residential
Among the items presented for digital forensic examination was a cell phone
with a 13+ megapixel camera capable of capturing high definition images.
Many of the images captured by and extracted from the phone contained a
pixel resolution of 2322 x 4128 and metadata directly linking the photos to
the device. During the forensic examination, experts collected evidence to
support charges for the possession, manufacture, and transmission of child
pornography. The pictures included adult hands and pornographic images of
[image: Open quotes]
As detectives further enlarged the pictures on the monitor, a high level of
detail was witnessed within the fingerprints.
In April 2015 Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office detectives, using a 42” high
definition monitor, observed a paint-like substance on the hands in the
photos, which correlated to the suspect’s trade as a painter. As detectives
further enlarged the pictures on the monitor, a high level of detail was
witnessed within the fingerprints. After removing the pornographic details,
investigators submitted five images to the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office
Fingerprint Unit with a request for analysis. The argument of “some other
guy did it” is a common defense in the field of digital forensics because
it often is not possible to determine who actually used a device.
Therefore, the potential of a fingerprint association becomes vitally
*Print Examination*
A latent print examiner (LPE) received the case and examined the ridge
detail present in the images. In one image (figure 1), detail was of
sufficient quality and quantity to be identified as the left middle finger
of the suspect when compared with fingerprints taken during the jail
booking process. Due to the digital image being a reversal of the print on
the booking card, the print as visualized in the phone image had to be
*Figure 1*
[image: FS figure 1.jpg]
This first identification was enough for the state attorney’s office to
request a motion to compel the offender to provide major case prints. The
office granted the motion, and the LPE went to the courtroom to take the
set of prints.
Further examination of two digital images from the phone led to
identification of the left thumb of the suspect on the major case prints.
These images were inverted for comparison. A second qualified LPE verified
all identifications.
Prior to trial the defense counsel successfully argued to have the
suspect’s confession suppressed. No faces were present in any images. This
made the fingerprint evidence extremely valuable because the suspect could
argue that a partner who had the same first name shared a common e-mail
account, and the fingers depicted in the images were from the partner. The
subject also could claim guilt for possession, distribution, and
transmission of child pornography, but not the manufacture.
The identifications made by the latent print examiners proved that the
suspect was involved directly in the acts as witnessed in the images
recovered by the digital forensic detectives. This conclusive evidence was
one piece of the forensic puzzle that assisted the jury in finding the
offender guilty of 26 charges, including capital sexual battery;
molestation; and possession, distribution, and transmission of child
pornography. The offender faces up to life in prison.

@_subject: New Lies For Old / The Perestroika Deception 
If you've never read them or even heard of them, I highly recommend them.
Whether you dismiss him or think there's something worth listening, the
Nosenko / Golitsyn permanently affair changed U.S. intelligence (not to
mention the JFK and Watergate connections).
New Lies For Old: The Perestroika Deception:
In his book Wedge - The Secret War between the FBI and CIA (Knopf, 1994),
Mark Riebling stated that of 194 predictions made in New Lies For Old, 139
had been fulfilled by 1993, 9 seemed 'clearly wrong', and the other 46 were
'not soon falsifiable'.
Golitsyn was a figure of significant controversy in the Western
intelligence community. The military writer General Sir John Hackett, and
the former CIA counter-intelligence director James Angleton identified
Golitsyn as "the most valuable defector ever to reach the West". However,
the official historian for MI5, Christopher Andrew, described him as an
"unreliable conspiracy theorist". Andrew believes that although
intelligence data provided by Golitsyn were reliable, some of his global
political assessments of the Soviet and KGB strategy are questionable.
New Lies for Old
In 1984, Golitsyn published the book *New Lies For Old*, wherein he warned
about a long-term deception  strategy
of seeming retreat from hard-line Communism designed to lull the West into
a false sense of security, and finally economically cripple and
diplomatically isolate the United States
. Among other things, Golitsyn
"The "liberalization" would be spectacular and impressive. Formal
pronouncements might be made about a reduction in the communist party's
role: its monopoly would be apparently curtailed. An ostensible separation
of powers between the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary might
be introduced. The Supreme Soviet would be given greater apparent power,
and the president of the Soviet Union and the first secretary of the party
might well be separated. The KGB would be "reformed." Dissidents at home
would be amnestied; those in exile abroad would be allowed to return, and
some would take up positions of leadership in government.Sakharov might be
included in some capacity in the government or allowed to teach abroad. The
creative arts and cultural and scientific organizations, such as the
writers' unions and Academy of Sciences, would become apparently more
independent, as would the trade unions. Political clubs would be opened to
nonmembers of the communist party. Leading dissidents might form one or
more alternative political parties.There would be greater freedom for
Soviet citizens to travel. Western and Unitized Nations observers would be
invited to the Soviet Union to witness the reforms in action."
Angleton and Golitsyn reportedly sought the assistance of William F.
Buckley, Jr.  (who
once worked for the CIA) in writing *New Lies for Old*. Buckley refused but
later went on to write a novel about Angleton, *Spytime: The Undoing of
James Jesus Angleton*.
The Perestroika Deception
In 1995 he published a book containing purported memoranda attributed to
Golitsyn entitled *The Perestroika
 Deception* which claimed:
   - "The [Soviet] strategists are concealing the secret coordination that
   exists and will continue between Moscow and the 'nationalist' leaders of
   [the] 'independent' republics."
   - "The power of the KGB remains as great as ever... Talk of cosmetic
   changes in the KGB and its supervision is deliberately publicized to
   support the myth of 'democratization' of the Soviet political system."
   - "Scratch these new, instant Soviet 'democrats,' 'anti-Communists,' and
   'nationalists' who have sprouted out of nowhere, and underneath will be
   found secret Party members or KGB agents."

@_subject: Former Spy Chief Reveals Secret Strategies for Undermining Freedom, 
Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa, the highest-ranking intelligence official ever
to defect from the Soviet Bloc, served as acting chief of communist
Romania's espionage service and top adviser to President Nicolae Ceausescu.
The highest-ranking Soviet bloc intelligence official ever to defect to the
West, Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa is at it again. Today, still living
undercover in the United States, the man credited by the CIA as the only
person in the Western world who single-handedly demolished an entire enemy
espionage service--the one he himself managed--takes aim at an even bigger
target: the exotic, widely misunderstood but still astonishingly
influential realm of the Russian-born "science" of disinformation.Indeed,
within these pages, Pacepa, along with his co-author, historian and law
professor Ronald Rychlak, expose some of the most consequential yet largely
unknown disinformation campaigns of our lifetime.
Discover answers to many crucial questions of the modern era:
   - Why, during the last two generations, has so much of the Western world
   turned against its founding faith, Christianity?
   - Why have radical Islam, jihad and terrorism burst aflame after a long
   period of apparent quiescence?
   - Why is naked Marxism increasingly manifesting in America and its NATO
   allies?
   - What really happened to Russia after the Berlin Wall came down?
Like the solution to a giant jigsaw puzzle lacking one crucial piece,
Disinformation authoritatively provides the missing dimension that makes
the chaos of the modern world finally understandable. By its very nature, a
disinformation campaign can work only if the seemingly independent Western
press accepts intentionally fabricated lies and presents them to the public
as truth. Thus, Pacepa and Rychlak also document how the U.S. "mainstream
media's" enduring sympathy for all things liberal-left has made it
vulnerable to--indeed, the prime carrier of--civilization-transforming
campaigns of lying, defamation and historical revisionism that turn reality
on its head.
   - How destroying the reputation of good leaders has been developed into
   a high art and science.
   - How Pope Pius XII --a generation ago the world's most high-profile
   Christian leader, who personally saved countless Jews from Hitler's
   Holocaust--was transformed, through the magic of disinformation, into a
   Nazi sympathizer.
   - How Christianity and Judaism have been targeted for constant
   denigration and defamation through an ongoing campaign of disinformation.
   - How the Soviet bloc planted 4,000 agents of influence in the Islamic
   world, armed with hundreds of thousands of copies of the most infamous
   anti-Semitic book in history, to fan the flames of ancient Arab resentments
   against the U.S. and Israel and sow the seeds of anti-Semitism that would
   later bloom in the form of violence and terror toward Jews and Christians.
   - How the defamatory attacks on American soldiers John Kerry made before
   Congress upon his return from Vietnam--charges later discredited and
   repudiated--were identical to a contemporaneous KGB disinformation campaign
   concocted to turn Americans against their own leaders.
   - How supposedly respectable institutions like the World Council of
   Churches have long been infiltrated and controlled by Russian intelligence.
   - How much of the world came to believe that the U.S. government itself
   masterminded the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
   - How the Soviet Union has been transformed into the first intelligence
   dictatorship in history.
   - How disinformation is still very much alive in the age of Obama,
   remaining a powerful engine in the ongoing socialist transformation of
   America.
All this and much more is meticulously documented in Disinformation, with
the credibility of an eyewitness who was not only there, but actively
involved as a Soviet bloc spy chief--who, thanks to a crisis of conscience,
"left the dark side" and came to America to help shine a light on the
greatest source of political evil of the modern age.

@_subject: Drug Lords and the Quiet Man Who Became the CIA's Master Killer 
Excerpts from the Kindle edition, description from Amazon.com.
In “How to Get Away with Murder in America,” Evan Wright reveals the story
of Enrique “Ricky” Prado, an alleged killer for a major Miami drug
trafficker who was recruited into the CIA. Despite a grand jury subpoena
and a mountain of evidence unearthed by a federal task force, Prado was
promoted into the agency’s highest echelons and charged with implementing
some of the country’s most sensitive post-9/11 counterterrorist operations,
including the agency’s secret “targeted assassination unit.” All while
staying in close touch with his cocaine-trafficking boss and, evidence
suggests, taking part in additional killings for him.
After Prado retired in 2004 at the rank of SIS-2—the CIA equivalent of a
two-star general—he moved to a senior position at Blackwater, the private
military contractor, where he continued to run the same, now-outsourced
“death squad.” Contrary to government assurances that it was never actually
activated, Wright reveals testimony from one of the Blackwater assassins
that Prado’s unit was indeed carrying out assigned killings. As a former
military intelligence officer told Wright in 2011, “Private contractors are
whacking people like crazy over in Afghanistan for the CIA.”
Unfortunately, while this book contains many tantalizing seeds it doesn't
provide context for many events. Further muddying the book's account is the
fact that it follows the investigation chronologically, and not the events
being investigated. Additional research is needed to build on what this
book began.

Cryptome1 KMMANLY (1951-53) was originally designed to counter the actions of

ratification of the contractual agreements. In practice KMMANLY sought to
win support for the European Defense Community (EDC) in areas of veterans'
affairs and military publishing. To achieve these aims, three publications
were utilized under KMMANLY -- Die Deutsche Soldaten Zeitung (The German
Soldiers' Newspaper, (DSZ)), Europaische Wehrkorrespondenz (European
Defense Newsletter, (EWK)), Wehr Wissenschaftliche Rundschau (Military
Science Journal, (WWR)). In addition KMMANLY supported the Gesellschaft

@_subject: FBI on MLK Jr. 
It didn't take as long as I thought it might to put the info together.
In December 1993, Lloyd Jowers appeared on ABC's Prime Time Live and
related the details of an alleged conspiracy involving the Mafia and the
U.S. government to kill King. According to Jowers, James Earl Ray was a
scapegoat, and was not responsible for the assassination. Jowers said that
he hired Memphis police Lieutenant Earl Clark to fire the fatal shot. The
existence of such a conspiracy, and Jowers' involvement, was supported in
the verdict of a 1998 court case which was brought against Jowers by the
King family. The allegations and the finding of the Memphis jury were later
rejected by the United States Department of Justice in 2000.
In 1998, the King family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Jowers and
"other unknown co-conspirators" for the murder of King. The King family was
represented by attorney William Pepper, who had previously served as the
attorney of James Earl Ray, King's formerly accused assassin. After four
weeks of testimony and over 70 witnesses in a civil trial in Memphis,
Tennessee, twelve jurors reached a unanimous verdict on December 8, 1999
after about an hour of deliberations that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was
assassinated as a result of a conspiracy which also involved "others,
including governmental agencies."
Mrs. Coretta Scott King commented on the verdict, saying, “There is
abundant evidence of a major high level conspiracy in the assassination of
my husband, Martin Luther King, Jr. And the civil court's unanimous verdict
has validated our belief. I wholeheartedly applaud the verdict of the jury
and I feel that justice has been well served in their deliberations. This
verdict is not only a great victory for my family, but also a great victory
for America."

Absolutely. It's a shitty situation for some counterintelligence folks
since it boils down to something that only hurts their Intel Community and
helps the opposition but there's nothing inherently wrong/bad with the
effort and the people behind it might not even be indirectly sponsored by a
foreign intelligence service.
This is a serious question for those of you who swore an oath to uphold
I personally think that in most cases it's better to make a difference from
inside than outside. There are exceptions and situations where that's
impossible, of course, and sometimes an external shock to the system is
necessary to instigate change... but it's always uncontrolled. I want
people to stick around to fix things, not exit and point out the problems.
That's a very personal choice with a lot of variables though, so I respect
people that come to a different conclusion.
If you do not wish to exit, then make it so others can, easily, simply,
100% agree, with the additional thought that the exit interviews should try
to find a way to 1. solve the problem and 2. hopefully retain the employee.
Or, at the very least, what secrets can you gain from the other side(s)
And now we get into the CI nightmare again. It can be a ripe field for
recruiting, theoretically. At least one study (I think more, but can't be
sure off the top of my head) has shown that for people who were current and
active personnel at the time, ideology played a relatively low motivation
in betrayals and leaks (to the press or foreign agencies). Usually it's
money or revenge, both of which could certainly play a role for people
exiting the service.

@_subject: FBI Digital Forensic Examination: A Case Study 
Copied below (some/all of the formatting will likely be stripped by the
mailing list)
*Forensic Spotlight*
*Digital Forensic Examination: A Case Study*
By John McHenry and Michael Gorn, M.S.
A 2014 investigation into the distribution of child pornography revealed
the identity and geographic location of a suspect. The case expanded to
include domestic and international elements and collaboration by multiple
law enforcement agencies associated with the Internet Crimes Against
Children (ICAC) task force.
A Sarasota, Florida, municipality was tasked with the local investigation,
which led to the January 2015 arrest of a 34-year-old male. The city
requested the assistance of Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office Intelligence
Unit digital forensics experts to complete a comprehensive examination of
the devices seized during the arrest. The information presented with the
case indicated that the suspect was a local commercial and residential
Among the items presented for digital forensic examination was a cell phone
with a 13+ megapixel camera capable of capturing high definition images.
Many of the images captured by and extracted from the phone contained a
pixel resolution of 2322 x 4128 and metadata directly linking the photos to
the device. During the forensic examination, experts collected evidence to
support charges for the possession, manufacture, and transmission of child
pornography. The pictures included adult hands and pornographic images of
[image: Open quotes]
As detectives further enlarged the pictures on the monitor, a high level of
detail was witnessed within the fingerprints.
In April 2015 Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office detectives, using a 42” high
definition monitor, observed a paint-like substance on the hands in the
photos, which correlated to the suspect’s trade as a painter. As detectives
further enlarged the pictures on the monitor, a high level of detail was
witnessed within the fingerprints. After removing the pornographic details,
investigators submitted five images to the Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office
Fingerprint Unit with a request for analysis. The argument of “some other
guy did it” is a common defense in the field of digital forensics because
it often is not possible to determine who actually used a device.
Therefore, the potential of a fingerprint association becomes vitally
*Print Examination*
A latent print examiner (LPE) received the case and examined the ridge
detail present in the images. In one image (figure 1), detail was of
sufficient quality and quantity to be identified as the left middle finger
of the suspect when compared with fingerprints taken during the jail
booking process. Due to the digital image being a reversal of the print on
the booking card, the print as visualized in the phone image had to be
*Figure 1*
[image: FS figure 1.jpg]
This first identification was enough for the state attorney’s office to
request a motion to compel the offender to provide major case prints. The
office granted the motion, and the LPE went to the courtroom to take the
set of prints.
Further examination of two digital images from the phone led to
identification of the left thumb of the suspect on the major case prints.
These images were inverted for comparison. A second qualified LPE verified
all identifications.
Prior to trial the defense counsel successfully argued to have the
suspect’s confession suppressed. No faces were present in any images. This
made the fingerprint evidence extremely valuable because the suspect could
argue that a partner who had the same first name shared a common e-mail
account, and the fingers depicted in the images were from the partner. The
subject also could claim guilt for possession, distribution, and
transmission of child pornography, but not the manufacture.
The identifications made by the latent print examiners proved that the
suspect was involved directly in the acts as witnessed in the images
recovered by the digital forensic detectives. This conclusive evidence was
one piece of the forensic puzzle that assisted the jury in finding the
offender guilty of 26 charges, including capital sexual battery;
molestation; and possession, distribution, and transmission of child
pornography. The offender faces up to life in prison.

@_subject: New Lies For Old / The Perestroika Deception 
If you've never read them or even heard of them, I highly recommend them.
Whether you dismiss him or think there's something worth listening, the
Nosenko / Golitsyn permanently affair changed U.S. intelligence (not to
mention the JFK and Watergate connections).
New Lies For Old: The Perestroika Deception:
In his book Wedge - The Secret War between the FBI and CIA (Knopf, 1994),
Mark Riebling stated that of 194 predictions made in New Lies For Old, 139
had been fulfilled by 1993, 9 seemed 'clearly wrong', and the other 46 were
'not soon falsifiable'.
Golitsyn was a figure of significant controversy in the Western
intelligence community. The military writer General Sir John Hackett, and
the former CIA counter-intelligence director James Angleton identified
Golitsyn as "the most valuable defector ever to reach the West". However,
the official historian for MI5, Christopher Andrew, described him as an
"unreliable conspiracy theorist". Andrew believes that although
intelligence data provided by Golitsyn were reliable, some of his global
political assessments of the Soviet and KGB strategy are questionable.
New Lies for Old
In 1984, Golitsyn published the book *New Lies For Old*, wherein he warned
about a long-term deception  strategy
of seeming retreat from hard-line Communism designed to lull the West into
a false sense of security, and finally economically cripple and
diplomatically isolate the United States
. Among other things, Golitsyn
"The "liberalization" would be spectacular and impressive. Formal
pronouncements might be made about a reduction in the communist party's
role: its monopoly would be apparently curtailed. An ostensible separation
of powers between the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary might
be introduced. The Supreme Soviet would be given greater apparent power,
and the president of the Soviet Union and the first secretary of the party
might well be separated. The KGB would be "reformed." Dissidents at home
would be amnestied; those in exile abroad would be allowed to return, and
some would take up positions of leadership in government.Sakharov might be
included in some capacity in the government or allowed to teach abroad. The
creative arts and cultural and scientific organizations, such as the
writers' unions and Academy of Sciences, would become apparently more
independent, as would the trade unions. Political clubs would be opened to
nonmembers of the communist party. Leading dissidents might form one or
more alternative political parties.There would be greater freedom for
Soviet citizens to travel. Western and Unitized Nations observers would be
invited to the Soviet Union to witness the reforms in action."
Angleton and Golitsyn reportedly sought the assistance of William F.
Buckley, Jr.  (who
once worked for the CIA) in writing *New Lies for Old*. Buckley refused but
later went on to write a novel about Angleton, *Spytime: The Undoing of
James Jesus Angleton*.
The Perestroika Deception
In 1995 he published a book containing purported memoranda attributed to
Golitsyn entitled *The Perestroika
 Deception* which claimed:
   - "The [Soviet] strategists are concealing the secret coordination that
   exists and will continue between Moscow and the 'nationalist' leaders of
   [the] 'independent' republics."
   - "The power of the KGB remains as great as ever... Talk of cosmetic
   changes in the KGB and its supervision is deliberately publicized to
   support the myth of 'democratization' of the Soviet political system."
   - "Scratch these new, instant Soviet 'democrats,' 'anti-Communists,' and
   'nationalists' who have sprouted out of nowhere, and underneath will be
   found secret Party members or KGB agents."

@_subject: Former Spy Chief Reveals Secret Strategies for Undermining Freedom, 
Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa, the highest-ranking intelligence official ever
to defect from the Soviet Bloc, served as acting chief of communist
Romania's espionage service and top adviser to President Nicolae Ceausescu.
The highest-ranking Soviet bloc intelligence official ever to defect to the
West, Lt. Gen. Ion Mihai Pacepa is at it again. Today, still living
undercover in the United States, the man credited by the CIA as the only
person in the Western world who single-handedly demolished an entire enemy
espionage service--the one he himself managed--takes aim at an even bigger
target: the exotic, widely misunderstood but still astonishingly
influential realm of the Russian-born "science" of disinformation.Indeed,
within these pages, Pacepa, along with his co-author, historian and law
professor Ronald Rychlak, expose some of the most consequential yet largely
unknown disinformation campaigns of our lifetime.
Discover answers to many crucial questions of the modern era:
   - Why, during the last two generations, has so much of the Western world
   turned against its founding faith, Christianity?
   - Why have radical Islam, jihad and terrorism burst aflame after a long
   period of apparent quiescence?
   - Why is naked Marxism increasingly manifesting in America and its NATO
   allies?
   - What really happened to Russia after the Berlin Wall came down?
Like the solution to a giant jigsaw puzzle lacking one crucial piece,
Disinformation authoritatively provides the missing dimension that makes
the chaos of the modern world finally understandable. By its very nature, a
disinformation campaign can work only if the seemingly independent Western
press accepts intentionally fabricated lies and presents them to the public
as truth. Thus, Pacepa and Rychlak also document how the U.S. "mainstream
media's" enduring sympathy for all things liberal-left has made it
vulnerable to--indeed, the prime carrier of--civilization-transforming
campaigns of lying, defamation and historical revisionism that turn reality
on its head.
   - How destroying the reputation of good leaders has been developed into
   a high art and science.
   - How Pope Pius XII --a generation ago the world's most high-profile
   Christian leader, who personally saved countless Jews from Hitler's
   Holocaust--was transformed, through the magic of disinformation, into a
   Nazi sympathizer.
   - How Christianity and Judaism have been targeted for constant
   denigration and defamation through an ongoing campaign of disinformation.
   - How the Soviet bloc planted 4,000 agents of influence in the Islamic
   world, armed with hundreds of thousands of copies of the most infamous
   anti-Semitic book in history, to fan the flames of ancient Arab resentments
   against the U.S. and Israel and sow the seeds of anti-Semitism that would
   later bloom in the form of violence and terror toward Jews and Christians.
   - How the defamatory attacks on American soldiers John Kerry made before
   Congress upon his return from Vietnam--charges later discredited and
   repudiated--were identical to a contemporaneous KGB disinformation campaign
   concocted to turn Americans against their own leaders.
   - How supposedly respectable institutions like the World Council of
   Churches have long been infiltrated and controlled by Russian intelligence.
   - How much of the world came to believe that the U.S. government itself
   masterminded the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.
   - How the Soviet Union has been transformed into the first intelligence
   dictatorship in history.
   - How disinformation is still very much alive in the age of Obama,
   remaining a powerful engine in the ongoing socialist transformation of
   America.
All this and much more is meticulously documented in Disinformation, with
the credibility of an eyewitness who was not only there, but actively
involved as a Soviet bloc spy chief--who, thanks to a crisis of conscience,
"left the dark side" and came to America to help shine a light on the
greatest source of political evil of the modern age.

@_subject: Drug Lords and the Quiet Man Who Became the CIA's Master Killer 
Excerpts from the Kindle edition, description from Amazon.com.
In “How to Get Away with Murder in America,” Evan Wright reveals the story
of Enrique “Ricky” Prado, an alleged killer for a major Miami drug
trafficker who was recruited into the CIA. Despite a grand jury subpoena
and a mountain of evidence unearthed by a federal task force, Prado was
promoted into the agency’s highest echelons and charged with implementing
some of the country’s most sensitive post-9/11 counterterrorist operations,
including the agency’s secret “targeted assassination unit.” All while
staying in close touch with his cocaine-trafficking boss and, evidence
suggests, taking part in additional killings for him.
After Prado retired in 2004 at the rank of SIS-2—the CIA equivalent of a
two-star general—he moved to a senior position at Blackwater, the private
military contractor, where he continued to run the same, now-outsourced
“death squad.” Contrary to government assurances that it was never actually
activated, Wright reveals testimony from one of the Blackwater assassins
that Prado’s unit was indeed carrying out assigned killings. As a former
military intelligence officer told Wright in 2011, “Private contractors are
whacking people like crazy over in Afghanistan for the CIA.”
Unfortunately, while this book contains many tantalizing seeds it doesn't
provide context for many events. Further muddying the book's account is the
fact that it follows the investigation chronologically, and not the events
being investigated. Additional research is needed to build on what this
book began.

Since 2000, CIA has installed and maintained an electronic full-text

at NARA II in College Park, Maryland. *Over 11 million pages have been
released in electronic format and reside on the CREST database, from which
researchers have printed about 1.1 million pages. **In order to directly

KMMANLY (1951-53) was originally designed to counter the actions of
pacifist and neutralist groups in West Germany who were opposed to
ratification of the contractual agreements. In practice KMMANLY sought to
win support for the European Defense Community (EDC) in areas of veterans'
affairs and military publishing. To achieve these aims, three publications
were utilized under KMMANLY -- Die Deutsche Soldaten Zeitung (The German
Soldiers' Newspaper, (DSZ)), Europaische Wehrkorrespondenz (European
Defense Newsletter, (EWK)), Wehr Wissenschaftliche Rundschau (Military
Science Journal, (WWR)). In addition KMMANLY supported the Gesellschaft

high ranking German Army officers.

@_subject: FBI on MLK Jr. 
It didn't take as long as I thought it might to put the info together.
In December 1993, Lloyd Jowers appeared on ABC's Prime Time Live and
related the details of an alleged conspiracy involving the Mafia and the
U.S. government to kill King. According to Jowers, James Earl Ray was a
scapegoat, and was not responsible for the assassination. Jowers said that
he hired Memphis police Lieutenant Earl Clark to fire the fatal shot. The
existence of such a conspiracy, and Jowers' involvement, was supported in
the verdict of a 1998 court case which was brought against Jowers by the
King family. The allegations and the finding of the Memphis jury were later
rejected by the United States Department of Justice in 2000.
In 1998, the King family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Jowers and
"other unknown co-conspirators" for the murder of King. The King family was
represented by attorney William Pepper, who had previously served as the
attorney of James Earl Ray, King's formerly accused assassin. After four
weeks of testimony and over 70 witnesses in a civil trial in Memphis,
Tennessee, twelve jurors reached a unanimous verdict on December 8, 1999
after about an hour of deliberations that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was
assassinated as a result of a conspiracy which also involved "others,
including governmental agencies."
Mrs. Coretta Scott King commented on the verdict, saying, “There is
abundant evidence of a major high level conspiracy in the assassination of
my husband, Martin Luther King, Jr. And the civil court's unanimous verdict
has validated our belief. I wholeheartedly applaud the verdict of the jury
and I feel that justice has been well served in their deliberations. This
verdict is not only a great victory for my family, but also a great victory
for America."

It's outside the realm of your usual FOIA requests, but since I'm out of
requests for the month (and already bought more than a few extra...) I
figured I'd mention it.
While posting docs related to the MLK assassination trial
I realized that Loyd Jowers ,
who confessed to playing a part in the MLK assassination a few months
before his death, surely has an FBI file. The DOJ did a follow-up
investigation and their report concluded he and the other witnesses were
lying, but it'd be interesting to see what the FBI had on him and what
materials the DOJ/FBI referenced beyond the trial transcript.
Let me know if you file anything on it, otherwise I'll try to get to it
next month (unless I get distracted by other shiny FOIAs/projects/IRL (what
do I mean, this listserv isn't real?!?) stuffs).

Absolutely. It's a shitty situation for some counterintelligence folks
since it boils down to something that only hurts their Intel Community and
helps the opposition but there's nothing inherently wrong/bad with the
effort and the people behind it might not even be indirectly sponsored by a
foreign intelligence service.
This is a serious question for those of you who swore an oath to uphold
I personally think that in most cases it's better to make a difference from
inside than outside. There are exceptions and situations where that's
impossible, of course, and sometimes an external shock to the system is
necessary to instigate change... but it's always uncontrolled. I want
people to stick around to fix things, not exit and point out the problems.
That's a very personal choice with a lot of variables though, so I respect
people that come to a different conclusion.
If you do not wish to exit, then make it so others can, easily, simply,
100% agree, with the additional thought that the exit interviews should try
to find a way to 1. solve the problem and 2. hopefully retain the employee.
Or, at the very least, what secrets can you gain from the other side(s)
And now we get into the CI nightmare again. It can be a ripe field for
recruiting, theoretically. At least one study (I think more, but can't be
sure off the top of my head) has shown that for people who were current and
active personnel at the time, ideology played a relatively low motivation
in betrayals and leaks (to the press or foreign agencies). Usually it's
money or revenge, both of which could certainly play a role for people
exiting the service.
