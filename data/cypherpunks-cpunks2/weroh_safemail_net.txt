@_subject: Improvement on the Jim Bell AP 
I thought about a way to make an "improvement" on the Jim Bell AP.
I think that this will make it "cheaper", faster and so more effective.
It starts from the part that as there could be more assassins competing for the prize.
Some of them can be uncertain that the prize could be too much low for the risk of killing the politician.
But at the same time, because of the possible competing killers, everyone of them can even be afraid that another assassin could be brave, skilled or just lucky to being able to kill the politician for a lower prize.
So this is already a good incentive to push all the killers to try to kill the politician for a lower prize.
What I thought is a way to make this incentive even more effective.
"Shared money"
Everyone should be able (if they want) to put their money on more politicians "contemporary", even on every politicians on the service or others that they can add later.
Those shared money should be pubblic visible to everyone, so even killers should be able to see them at any time.
On the possible interface of the service, it should be possible, by clicking on a politician, to see how much money on him are shared with other politicians.
So what happen when if one of the politicians that has some shared money on him gets killed?
Those shared money will obviously get removed by all the prize of all the other selected politicians (chosen before by the users that have put their own money) and will go to the winning killer.
With this, I think that all killers will then know that while they are thinking about killing "Politician A", if the money on his prize is shared with other 4/5 politicians, they will be now even worried that another killer will terminate one of the other politicians, and so then lowering the prize of their selected politician as a possible target.
Users will still be happy because another politician has been killed anyway.
Users will then be able to put even 1$ contemporary on every politician of their country (or the entire world), waiting that the first one of them gets killed.
Then again, 1$ over all the remaining politicians and so on ...
What do you think about this idea/improvement?
Is it clear enough?

I want to add that this improvement works because who put the money isn't probably interested on who should die first, every politics should die, the order isn't really important.
Another good thing about this way it is that if some politicians have some money shared on their heads, everyone of them will be incentived to kill himself the others, his colleagues, by hoping to lower the money on his own head.

One last thing.
I think that this way is also less violent than the original AP, because after adding on list the name of all the politicians, all the policemen, all burocrats, after few deaths, no one will ever want to continue to work for the state, at least no one of the low grade state employees.
No one of them is paid enough to risk their life daily.
So every authority will find himself powerless, without anyone available to get his orders.
The state will probably disappears after few deaths.

This can be a good way to develop it:
1 - The AP service will list all the names of the politicians in the concress/parlament/government, as they are already well known.
Users will be able to put money on some of them, or all of them (shared money). This is the usual AP with the improvement.
2 - The AP service will also allow users to create bounties to get a leak of name lists of all the local policemen, or local politicians or bureaucrats in a city, or region, or district, or country or the entire state.
3 - After the AP service receives a list, the service staff will make a first check internally, and if they think that the list can be a good confirmed one, they will put it on "public debate", from the users of the service. The list should be visible to anyone, even guest users.
This step is important, because all the global news will talk about the name list, and so all the state employees (even the ones that aren't on the current list) will become completely crazy. If they aren't on the current list, they will be afraid of being on the next one.
4 - If the list is confirmed even from the public debate (the service staff has the last word), the names on the list will be added, and users will now be able to put money also on them.
The user that gave the now confirmed name list to the AP service will now get the money from the dedicated bounty created at step 2.
I think that if the panic from the state employees is enough, everything will just stop at step 3. The state will already disappear. So no deaths at all.
Many of them will leave their jobs. They will probably put their confirmation of dismissal on their facebook profile in the hope of being removed from the service.
Even if someone of their colleagues will die for natural reasons, or even for a car accident, they will still think that someone has killed him/her.
I guess that they will be in complete panic.
