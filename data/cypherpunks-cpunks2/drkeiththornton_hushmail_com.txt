Captain Crunch will be facing some very difficult surgery on March 28,
2017 involving 3 incisions, 1 in his side after removal of one of his
ribs. 1 in the front of his stomach where they have to move all of his
vital organs aside and 1 in his back requiring an 8 inch incision to
gain access to his spinal column.""
They have to put a "cage" surrounding his discs and add 4 more screws
to help support his spine.The surgery will last approximately 9 hours
or more, and may involve a second surgery the following week if there
isn't enough time to complete the entire surgery at once.""
This extremely complex and dangerous surgery gives Crunch a 50/50
chance of a normal life. A 10% chance he may not recover at all and a
20% chance of becoming permantly paralyzed.""
There is 4 to 6 months of recovery and requires significant homecare
after he is discharged from the rehab center.""
Without this funding, he will not be able to maintain a normal life or
care for himself. He will be bedridden most of the time throughout the
recovery process.""
The Crunchman will have limited access to his computer and if the
funding is successful, he will try to arrange a way to access his
computer from his bed.""
