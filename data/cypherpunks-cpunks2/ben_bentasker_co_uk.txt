Aye, but they've not also given them a section on their blog to post on
have they?
If you look a little deeper, you'll also find it's not the fundamental
views (and expression of) themselves that Twitter have taken issue with,
it's that the users in question repeatedly violated the ToS.
There's really not that much wrong with an individual service provider
deciding there are rules if you want to use their service. There might, of
course, be some chilling effects if all players in that area decide to
enforce overly strict rules, but that's somewhat different.
As ever, XKCD is relevant -

Twitter is entirely dependant on it's userbase, yes. If they feel that
allowing that kind of speech is going to lead to users not feeling
comfortable using the service (leading to a reduction of the userbase) the
only sane commercial decision is to remove the problematic speech, no?
Working for the government or not, they're hardly likely to stand and
defend harassment when that'll cost them users. Especially given that it
sounds like they do a terrible job of making money out of those users anyway
It's not intended as a defence of Twitter per se.
I'm not a fan of corporations by any stretch of the imagination, and
certainly not of the American capitalism rules all mindset.
But you know what, I believe in individual rights, and that includes the
right not to be party to something like harassment. If you're being made to
carry things you staunchly disagree with, in a world where people will
associate them with you, that's - in effect- compelling speech which is
just as bad (if not worse) than suppressing speech.
A corporation actually take a stance to try and prevent some of the
targeted abuse that flows online is a good thing. It might not (nay,
doesn't) offset the myriad faults with the system, but it's a lean towards
benefiting the userbase (even if driven primarily by self-interest). The
world isn't black and white, even the truly evil can perform good acts from
time to time.
Don't forget these guys weren't banned for being right-wing, or for
expressing "alt-right" views. Most (if not all) had a habit of directly
harassing people for race, gender, whatever.
They're still free to continue running websites promoting their views. I'd
have a bigger issue with a hosting company refusing to host what amounts to
a political (if extreme) opinion or news site.
The line seems to be drawn at launching direct attacks, which doesn't seem
unreasonable, especially given the reality is we live in a world where
capitalism currently exists, and most of society doesn't want to have to
deal with that type of bullshit.
Course, there is the question of how direct attacks should be defined too,
and there's no good way to do that definitively. I think encouraging
hundreds, if not thousands, of followers to hurl abuse at one user is
probably well over it though.
Not if you plan to use a service provided and controlled by that mafia. The
(non-corporate) mafia, in fact, tend to be quite insistent that you abide
by their terms
I know you'll probably disagree with huge chunks of that, if not all of it,
and it's probably a bit muddled where it's been rattled out.
The TL:DR is, there isn't a good answer that works in the world we
currently live in. Those that were banned (or at least those I've bothered
to look up) were assholes. Not because of their speech, but of their

Except as I tried to make clear in the rest of the email, it's not the
speech that's the issue, but the actions.
Want to post how much you hate (to pick an example) mexicans on twitter? Go
for it, it's unlikely you'll be banned.
Encourage hundreds, if not thousands, of others to tweet racist shit at a
single user? Its your action there that gets you banned. It's not what
you've said so much as the fact you've led a charge. Twitter'll deny you
the tools to take those actions.
My comment was in the context of a commercial decision, and yes, the sane
commercial decision is to remove those that are causing issues, if they're
in the minority. They're a corporation and can't let a small chunk of
revenue drive away large chunks. It's that simple.
Reddit had to go through a similar thing a while back, and shuttered
coontown (amongst other subs). Many predicted the demise of reddit, but in
reality, whilst some users left for Voat and probably never came back, most
of the remaining subs continue to thrive. Admittedly, that was more about
getting money to come onboard in the first place, so it was as much about
the investors sensibilities as the userbase.
_somebody_ claims to object to, fairly soon there will be little or no
speech to see.
I agree. And booting someone for saying something offensive isn't right.
Encouraging others to descend, en masse, on someone else though isn't just
speech, it's incitement - an action. Or at least as much as an action as
the average user can actually take online
I suspect you dropped "PC" in there because it's one of your trigger words.
This isn't about political correctness, this is about people getting
targeted, en masse, because their skin's the wrong colour, or because they
lack a penis (or in some cases, have one). Not about protecting peoples
sensibilities, but about outright, deliberate victimisation.
FTR, There's fuckload wrong with world of Political Correctness, especially
once you get people arguing that we should use so-called "positive
Leaving actions aside, and going back to the original reason I mailed the
list, Mirimir noted that ACLU supported the KKK's right to rally. IOW they
defend the KKK's right to free speech.
ACLU don't however, let the KKK hold those rallies in their carpark, or
provide them with megaphones etc. There's a big difference in defending the
right to speech and actively helping someone make that speech.
I see this as much the same, you've got the right to say what you like, and
I'll gladly defend that, but I'm not going to help you say it.
Why would Twitter be any different? Hell, the world in general is no
different. You don't see Breitbart hosting guest columns from lefties, just
as you don't tend to see liberal publications inviting the alt-right to put
their views forward. Each have to find their own, accommodating, venues to
push their agendas from.

Which unfortunately, corporations sometimes do. It's a very hard line to
draw to define when that's right or wrong, especially as it's always going
to be based on individual bias and opinions. What you find gravely
offensive I might find funny as fuck, and vice versa.
I've been on this list more than long enough to know you're not a statist
Juan, and I don't entirely disagree with a lot of your views, so I'm not
going to try and disagree here.
All I will say, is that the corporate entity is made up of lots of
individuals, though the corporate ethos (if you'll forgive the term, I know
it implies ethics which might actually be absent) will be dictated from on
It's a little more fine-grained than that. A corporation trying to protect
users (even if it does simply view them as a revenue source) is a good
effect for the majority of users. Doesn't help much if you're in the
minority though.
        Twitter and their political masters need to pretend that they
Here, I agree.
See the answer to your final question below
The difference is in the presentation. If you view something I've tweeted,
you've got twitter.com in the address bar, twitter branding spewed across
the page and have probably consciously chosen to visit twitter. Twitter is
associated (even if they're at pains to say they don't agree with
everything posted).
If I host my website with (say) godaddy, most visitors will be completely
unaware (unless I've deliberately added "hosted by go-daddy" to the site).
How many users look at who owns the IP block before visiting a site?
Not that I'm saying they couldn't try to apply your argument, just that
there are nuances.
They're actually reasonably explicit in what they consider "hateful" -
 - not that there isn't
wiggleroom if they wanted to though
Analogies tend to be flawed, but let me offer one anyway.
Say we meet in a bar.
- Case 1: You say something offensive and I punch you. Who's most in the
Fairly cut and dry, you may be a dick, but I'm in the wrong there. You used
your right to free speech, whereas I've taken an action that some (most?)
would consider unacceptable.
- Case 2: You decide you don't like me, and proceed to loudly tell the rest
of the bar that I'm (for example) a queer thats clearly in need of a
beating. Half the bar takes the opportunity to beat the shit out of me.
Half the bar crossed the line I crossed in case 1, so clearly they're in
the wrong.
You still only used speech (assuming you didn't get a crafty kick in,
anyway), but you used it in order to incite the bar to cause harm.
Physically, you didn't take any action, but I'd argue that convincing
others to do it for you is effectively an action by proxy.
Physical harm still came to me though, so we're still not close enough to
the Twitter angle.
- Case 3: Same as in case 2, except they don't beat the shit out of me.
Instead, they yell abuse and threaten to beat the shit out of me every time
they see me for the next month (or week if you prefer).
Again, you've only used speech, but you've used it to try and ensure that
my life is made a living hell (for whatever period of time). That's not
without it's ill effects (for me)
I'll agree that "action" isn't necessarily the best word for it, but
incitement sounds too much like something the government would say and I
don't like repeating it.
Most people just aren't equipped to deal with intense, persistent verbal
abuse, so if they're the victim of it, most don't cope too well. For much
the same reason, bystanders tend to be afraid to speak up in their defence
too. Which plays merry havoc with the ideal that the best defence against
"bad" speech is more speech, at least on the individual level.  At a higher
level it works over time, but it's the individual revenue sources that
corporations are trying to keep happy

him, going to be banned?  Somehow, I don't think so.  It's PC nonsense.
Selective enforcement.
Well, no. Just like you're not going to be for posting that you hate
mexicans, which is kind of my point.
Well, if that trick were used, people could be prosecuted for uttering
sounds that happen to sound like "hate speech".  See the problem?  Of
course you don't.
I think you're being intentionally dense here.
This isn't people tweeting "build a wall", it's throwing abuse at a
specific individual.
95%, you might have a point.  but I suspect you are really only referring
to the opinions objected to by (at most) 51% of the population, or in fact
far less.  (Say, speech objected to by 75% of the PC crowd, or maybe 10% of
the population.)
There's no way we can objectively measure this, but I think your figures
are wrong.
49% may not object to you tweeting "build a wall", but I think a much
smaller percentage would be happy with you (and others) racially abusing an
individual user (to pick an example). That's not "being PC", that's
thinking you're a prick for continually tweeting coon at a single user just
to see how they'll respond
their computer servers would melt down, or something, if HTML data with
certain data patterns were stored in it?
Well, yes. They had to, in that they felt they couldn't attract the revenue
they wanted to in the current state. Businesses, funnily enough, want to
make money.
attack them?   Or do you merely mean using speech that offends them?  If
the former, I don't see much of a problem.  If it is the latter, I see a
huge problem.
It *is* a little tricky to physically attack someone whilst on the
internet. But there are situations online that we consider worthy of the
term "attack". A DDoS Attack, for example, doesn't do any physical harm and
yet is still considered an attack. Why? Because it's a targeted and
deliberate attempt to interfere with operations.
If you're receiving thousands of abusive tweets sent specifically at you,
and/or those same people are filling your mailbox with the same, I'd call
that an attack. YMMV
based on the fact it's privately-owned.  However, that's a very imperfect
defense.  First, Twitter hasn't previously claimed that it has an
institutional bias.
You don't need to have previously expressed a public opinion on something
to suddenly find you don't agree with it.
Corporations (and media) aren't required to explicitly state whether
they're left or right leaning (which in some ways is a shame)
In the case of Twitter though, it's not like they haven't stated their
objections before -
- you'll have to forgive the somewhat PC tone of parts of that, I'm sure
google will find you examples closer to your tastes if needed
Twitter-like, but which openly engages in what we'd agree is hateful,
racist speech, and discriminates in employment.  If a person could use the
court system to try to shut them down, then it isn't purely a "private"
operation, is it?   It's subject to government regulation and control.  In
that case, I think that Twitter itself (following arguendo, the same logic)
should be subject to legal attack.
Now that's a complex area of law, and varies between countries. But, those
who were banned would (AFAIK) be perfectly at liberty to try and sue
Strange though, whenever something like this comes up, you sometimes hear
threats of legal action, but they're never followed through. It's almost as
if the complainers haven't got a case under law. Admittedly, it might well
be, of course, that the cards are unfairly stacked against them.
"left-wing" organization.  Now, apparently, it has.
See earlier comment - there's no requirement for them to have done so.
And just to be a little picky. In the rest of the world, Twitter are not a
left-wing organisation, nor are most of the US's "lefty" politicians much
further left than centre-right. But I take your point
that if there were any threats, I doubt they were credible at all.
That's a valid point (though I did say analogies were flawed). Receiving
those kind of threats is undoubtedly unpleasant, but you're right, they
shouldn't lead to quite the same fear for safety as in my scenario.
On the other hand, I could understand someone fearing that they were just
the beginning. The person sending them might not, physically, be able to
reach you themselves, but the next step might be swatting. But, to be fair,
at that point we're away from speech and well into real-world actions.
half accross the world saying he'll kill you? Your own account probably not
giving any real info about you either.
It's scary the amount of information people do put online, though most at
least have the sense to not publicly post their address. That's often not
enough, though. Both corporations and governments seem to take a laid back
approach to protecting the data they're given (and in the case of govt, the
data they compel us to give them), so with various leaks floating about
there's always the possibility that information can be gathered. Again,
though, I'll conceded that that's a seperate issue
out was essential.
There's definitely groups of people (some of those Jim would probably
correctly identify as "PC") who seem to revel in the ability to block
dissenting views. An individual blocking someone else, at most, is only
harming their ability to learn something about the opposing view. But
others do try to take it further by trying to have "it" blocked at a wider
level by coercing government (or private orgs) to act.
I think, to an extent, it depends as much on how the provider behaves as it
does on userbase level. Although actual function would need to come into it
The platform that twitter provides is one that lets you "reach" millions of
people. In some ways, it's almost unrivalled, in the sense that it's (IMO)
far easier to stumble across someone new on Twitter than it is on FB etc.
Whether that's an essential service, obviously, is up for debate.
To some extent, yes.
Yes. But, not following you doesn't mean that you can't dump stuff into my
notifications by simply including an  If you've got many hundreds of
people doing that, are you going to sit and block all of them?
Yes, I should have been saying verbally, you're right
Untrue. Depending on your settings, you'd need to be following me to for me
to send you a direct message.
But I can still include you in mentions which'll end up in your
notification area. As an added "bonus" those mentions are visible to anyone
who is following you, so they can reply to them (which'll also ping me). A
DM would, at least, be hidden from your followers
If you look at Razers tweet earlier, you'll probably find he's not
following any of those
At what point, in the online world, would you consider something becomes
analogous to a real-world action?
Their action was that they verbally attacked someone (and encouraged others
to do so) - obviously doing that requires speech but the two are not the
same thing.

Sorry, that wasn't my intention. I was hung over and trying to interpret
what exactly you actually meant by "service provider", as I wasn't entirely
clear whether you were viewing it as a utility or an essential service, so
I expounded a little on my thinking which has obviously made it less clear.
For a utility? That number seems reasonable to me
They almost certainly are, yes.
Yes, and with email you at least have the ability to set up some very
strict filters to try and limit what you receive. Until recently, Twitter
lacked even the beginnings of that - they've recently added the ability to
"mute" tweets based on keyword. Not tried it though so it might be crap.
I _think_ it's probably fair to say that the tools Twitter provide were
probably reasonable for how they envisioned the platform being used.
Whether through simple growth or lack of imagination, though, it is fairly
flawed if your aim is to filter things getting sent to you directly
In the case of Razer's tweet, we actually need to look at the reverse (so I
mis-stated it a bit).
Razer sent an unsolicited tweet to three people, all of whom are unlikely
to be following him. They'll have received a notification of the tweet.
If they don't like it, it's fairly simple, they just click to block Razer.
But, if every one of Razer's followers (as well as randoms who stumble over
the tweet) retweet it (or generate completely new tweets), they'll then get
new copies/notifications.
I can't actually remember for sure whether blocking on twitter does
anything with retweets. If you've blocked Razer and I retweet his tweet,
it's possible Twitter will see who the originator is and block it, but I've
a feeling that isn't the case.
"mentioning" a user like that is fairly routine on Twitter though, and if
you're replying to a tweet (that you've stumbled over by looking at
trending keywords, or whatever) the interface even drops a mention in for
anyone involved in that thread. So it's well within the ability of the
average user
Yes, I think that'd probably be a good idea. Blocking by "person" also
comes with the downside that the persistent will create and cycle new
profiles, being able top block based on some kind of algorithm would be
good. From a quick scan, it looks like the new muting ability goes some way
towards that - Course, it does mean that (in effect) you'll be the only person not to see
the tweets as they'll still be publicly available. That's obviously
different to dropping email at the edge, but it seems reasonable as it's
not that dissimilar to if those comments had been published on a blog.
As I said before, for them it was probably a commercial decision, and at a
commercial level it makes sense.
At a technical level, they've not kept pace with demand in terms of
creating tools so that people can effectively filter what they're
receiving, so it's possible that they felt - in the short term - that there
wasn't any other way.
Corporations exist as a part of a capitalist society, a rightly or wrongly,
a good proportion of that society see the bans as acceptable. Course,
that's easy to attain when a good proportion of society sees the speech
being blocked as distasteful, but my point is, from Twitters PoV they
probably see that the majority of the users either support it or are
I'm not saying that's an ideal place for society to be...
Ethically speaking you're correct, but, let's follow this through a bit, as
the idea is semi-intriguing. To start with I'm going to pull in some of
what you've said previously (as that's interesting too)
So, to summarise the claim "Twitter is in fact a utility provider, so
should be subject to a Universal Service Obligation, and as such cannot
discriminate against users"
Twitter are in the US, so the laws are already stacked against the
claimants. I'm also not in the US so will probably make a few errors here
First hurdle is going to be actually showing that Twitter qualify as the
sort of Communications Provider that would fall under the necessary
regulations (that is, that they should be subject to FCC oversight). Given
the ramifications for Twitter, they'd resist that *very* strongly. I'm not
100% sure there's a case to be made here, at least under the laws as they
stand, especially when you consider similar providers (FB et all) would
probably file ex parte's in support of Twitter (as a decision in the wrong
way might hit their profits/responisibilities too)
But, assuming you get past that, the next thing is to try and and enforce
those obligations. Given how hard some of the actual ISPs (Comcast in
particular) have fought, ducked and weaved, in order to avoid living up to
those obligations, I'd imagine Twitter (with their smaller US userbase)
would probably put up some pretty meaningful resistance here too.
Ultimately, I think that lawsuit would probably be doomed from the outset.
Going back to what you actually just said though - that the privileges
corporations have give rise to obligations to the rest of society.
At a point, that is something that's semi-reflected in law. If you look at
the anti-trust stuff, once a provider reaches a monopoly share on the
market, there are additional responsibilities that are enforced (though I'd
argue that actually, most of them seem to be obligations to "the market"
rather than to the user-base as such - they're predicated on the
fundamental idea that the free market solves all, which doesn't work so
well when the players are all bent in one way or another).
So there is a kind of precedence.
There are other obligations as well (like not dumping chemical waste in the
water supply), but IMO they're currently viewed more as rules imposed than
actual responsibilities (i.e. they seem to be dodged any time there's an
What they all seem to run up against is this myth that corporations have an
overwhelming responsibility to their share holders. It gets used as an
excuse to let common decency be overridden by the profit imperative.
Without finally putting that to rest (somehow), I don't think it matters
what responsibilities society says it expects from the corporations,
they'll simply be ignored when it suits.
Given that lawsuits are predicated on what the law says, if those ethics
aren't reflected in law, lawsuits aren't going to prevail. Seems to be the
case, at the moment, that even when they are, the punishment doesn't always
cost the corp more than they made from the breach.
No idea how we fix that though, the lawmaking structure is broken, and even
if it wasn't the laws that already exist get ignored or willfully
misinterpreted in pursuit of the next dime.
True, and you just named several "platforms" that those banned _could_ use
instead of Twitter.
In the context of it being like an action though, I'd say encouraging the
same flood of abuse would be more or less the same on all of those. The
tooling for dealing with it on each of those differs though, and I think
Twitter's probably at the bottom of the list in terms of means of stopping
it (assuming we accept that all-together leaving the service isn't an ideal
No, they said my request for money might be offensive to those who believe

As the very first comment on that slashdot post says, what reporter is
going to stop and do a whois before publishing the juicy, breaking news
they just stumbled on. Requiring real-names doesn't help with the issue,
but risks harming plenty. Having your contact details in a publicly
accessible database can lead to self-censorship through fear that
someone'll do a who-is and pay a visit (or coerce the local plod into
unwittingly doing so).
It was a land grab when ICANN tried it previously, and doesn't bring any
additional benefit now. It's funny though, how many years have we been
telling people to avoid putting personal details online, and still we're
seeing people trying to demand more.
Which (IMO) is part of what screwed Clinton over. If you look at the stuff
that came up in the final months, whilst damaging, it was all stuff that
she could probably have recovered from (the public being fairly fickle and
forgetting things quite quickly) had it come up earlier on.
Had the media broached it further on rather than trying to ignore it, they
could have helped the candidate they wanted to win to actually do so.
Instead they buried their heads in the sand and pretended there was nothing
to see, even as it became clearer and clearer that there was quite a lot
more to be told.
Whether you're happy or sad about Trump, I think it's fair to say the media

They've previously said that this won't be the case. Whether that proves
true is something else, of course, especially as they've still not been
able to explain exactly how they intend those companies to decrypt.
In reality various bits are almost certain to hit the European Court and
get shot down, though it might then get resurrected post-Brexit. ICR's in
particular probably don't stand much chance of surviving.
No-one's quite sure exactly which providers are going to be expected to
keep the logs either, as there's no definition of what a CSP is. It's
almost a given that consumer ISPs will be required to, but who else?
I currently have no idea what, if any, of the various services I make
available will be affected. I'd shut down operations before even
considering complying with some of the requirements.
Apparently they need to constrain the scope a little and be targeting
something specific, but essentially, yes.
For security concerns I propose we boycott all and any technology,
If you're going to do that, be very vocal about the business you would have

In particular, there's a good chance those companies won't be allowed to
disclose that they've had to comply. Warrant canaries arguably don't work
as well in the UK as (IIRC) you can be ordered to avoid doing anything that
might lead to disclosure of the order, which would include failing to
update the canary. At least, I recall reading that somewhere.

Aye, but they've not also given them a section on their blog to post on
have they?
If you look a little deeper, you'll also find it's not the fundamental
views (and expression of) themselves that Twitter have taken issue with,
it's that the users in question repeatedly violated the ToS.
There's really not that much wrong with an individual service provider
deciding there are rules if you want to use their service. There might, of
course, be some chilling effects if all players in that area decide to
enforce overly strict rules, but that's somewhat different.

Twitter is entirely dependant on it's userbase, yes. If they feel that
allowing that kind of speech is going to lead to users not feeling
comfortable using the service (leading to a reduction of the userbase) the
only sane commercial decision is to remove the problematic speech, no?
Working for the government or not, they're hardly likely to stand and
defend harassment when that'll cost them users. Especially given that it
sounds like they do a terrible job of making money out of those users anyway
It's not intended as a defence of Twitter per se.
I'm not a fan of corporations by any stretch of the imagination, and
certainly not of the American capitalism rules all mindset.
But you know what, I believe in individual rights, and that includes the
right not to be party to something like harassment. If you're being made to
carry things you staunchly disagree with, in a world where people will
associate them with you, that's - in effect- compelling speech which is
just as bad (if not worse) than suppressing speech.
A corporation actually take a stance to try and prevent some of the
targeted abuse that flows online is a good thing. It might not (nay,
doesn't) offset the myriad faults with the system, but it's a lean towards
benefiting the userbase (even if driven primarily by self-interest). The
world isn't black and white, even the truly evil can perform good acts from
time to time.
Don't forget these guys weren't banned for being right-wing, or for
expressing "alt-right" views. Most (if not all) had a habit of directly
harassing people for race, gender, whatever.
They're still free to continue running websites promoting their views. I'd
have a bigger issue with a hosting company refusing to host what amounts to
a political (if extreme) opinion or news site.
The line seems to be drawn at launching direct attacks, which doesn't seem
unreasonable, especially given the reality is we live in a world where
capitalism currently exists, and most of society doesn't want to have to
deal with that type of bullshit.
Course, there is the question of how direct attacks should be defined too,
and there's no good way to do that definitively. I think encouraging
hundreds, if not thousands, of followers to hurl abuse at one user is
probably well over it though.
Not if you plan to use a service provided and controlled by that mafia. The
(non-corporate) mafia, in fact, tend to be quite insistent that you abide
by their terms
I know you'll probably disagree with huge chunks of that, if not all of it,
and it's probably a bit muddled where it's been rattled out.
The TL:DR is, there isn't a good answer that works in the world we
currently live in. Those that were banned (or at least those I've bothered
to look up) were assholes. Not because of their speech, but of their

Except as I tried to make clear in the rest of the email, it's not the
speech that's the issue, but the actions.
Want to post how much you hate (to pick an example) mexicans on twitter? Go
for it, it's unlikely you'll be banned.
Encourage hundreds, if not thousands, of others to tweet racist shit at a
single user? Its your action there that gets you banned. It's not what
you've said so much as the fact you've led a charge. Twitter'll deny you
the tools to take those actions.
My comment was in the context of a commercial decision, and yes, the sane
commercial decision is to remove those that are causing issues, if they're
in the minority. They're a corporation and can't let a small chunk of
revenue drive away large chunks. It's that simple.
Reddit had to go through a similar thing a while back, and shuttered
coontown (amongst other subs). Many predicted the demise of reddit, but in
reality, whilst some users left for Voat and probably never came back, most
of the remaining subs continue to thrive. Admittedly, that was more about
getting money to come onboard in the first place, so it was as much about
the investors sensibilities as the userbase.
_somebody_ claims to object to, fairly soon there will be little or no
speech to see.
I agree. And booting someone for saying something offensive isn't right.
Encouraging others to descend, en masse, on someone else though isn't just
speech, it's incitement - an action. Or at least as much as an action as
the average user can actually take online
I suspect you dropped "PC" in there because it's one of your trigger words.
This isn't about political correctness, this is about people getting

lack a penis (or in some cases, have one). Not about protecting peoples
sensibilities, but about outright, deliberate victimisation.

Leaving actions aside, and going back to the original reason I mailed the

ACLU don't however, let the KKK hold those rallies in their carpark, or

right to speech and actively helping someone make that speech.
I see this as much the same, you've got the right to say what you like, and
I'll gladly defend that, but I'm not going to help you say it.
Why would Twitter be any different? Hell, the world in general is no
different. You don't see Breitbart hosting guest columns from lefties, just
as you don't tend to see liberal publications inviting the alt-right to put

push their agendas from.

Which unfortunately, corporations sometimes do. It's a very hard line to
draw to define when that's right or wrong, especially as it's always going
to be based on individual bias and opinions. What you find gravely
offensive I might find funny as fuck, and vice versa.
I've been on this list more than long enough to know you're not a statist
Juan, and I don't entirely disagree with a lot of your views, so I'm not
going to try and disagree here.
All I will say, is that the corporate entity is made up of lots of
individuals, though the corporate ethos (if you'll forgive the term, I know
it implies ethics which might actually be absent) will be dictated from on
It's a little more fine-grained than that. A corporation trying to protect
users (even if it does simply view them as a revenue source) is a good
effect for the majority of users. Doesn't help much if you're in the
minority though.

Here, I agree.
See the answer to your final question below
The difference is in the presentation. If you view something I've tweeted,
you've got twitter.com in the address bar, twitter branding spewed across
the page and have probably consciously chosen to visit twitter. Twitter is
associated (even if they're at pains to say they don't agree with
everything posted).
If I host my website with (say) godaddy, most visitors will be completely
unaware (unless I've deliberately added "hosted by go-daddy" to the site).
How many users look at who owns the IP block before visiting a site?
Not that I'm saying they couldn't try to apply your argument, just that
there are nuances.
They're actually reasonably explicit in what they consider "hateful" -
 - not that there isn't
wiggleroom if they wanted to though
Analogies tend to be flawed, but let me offer one anyway.
Say we meet in a bar.
- Case 1: You say something offensive and I punch you. Who's most in the
Fairly cut and dry, you may be a dick, but I'm in the wrong there. You used
your right to free speech, whereas I've taken an action that some (most?)
would consider unacceptable.
- Case 2: You decide you don't like me, and proceed to loudly tell the rest
of the bar that I'm (for example) a queer thats clearly in need of a
beating. Half the bar takes the opportunity to beat the shit out of me.
Half the bar crossed the line I crossed in case 1, so clearly they're in
the wrong.
You still only used speech (assuming you didn't get a crafty kick in,
anyway), but you used it in order to incite the bar to cause harm.
Physically, you didn't take any action, but I'd argue that convincing
others to do it for you is effectively an action by proxy.
Physical harm still came to me though, so we're still not close enough to
the Twitter angle.
- Case 3: Same as in case 2, except they don't beat the shit out of me.
Instead, they yell abuse and threaten to beat the shit out of me every time
they see me for the next month (or week if you prefer).
Again, you've only used speech, but you've used it to try and ensure that
my life is made a living hell (for whatever period of time). That's not
without it's ill effects (for me)
I'll agree that "action" isn't necessarily the best word for it, but
incitement sounds too much like something the government would say and I
don't like repeating it.
Most people just aren't equipped to deal with intense, persistent verbal
abuse, so if they're the victim of it, most don't cope too well. For much
the same reason, bystanders tend to be afraid to speak up in their defence
too. Which plays merry havoc with the ideal that the best defence against
"bad" speech is more speech, at least on the individual level.  At a higher
level it works over time, but it's the individual revenue sources that
corporations are trying to keep happy

him, going to be banned?  Somehow, I don't think so.  It's PC nonsense.
Selective enforcement.
Well, no. Just like you're not going to be for posting that you hate
mexicans, which is kind of my point.
Well, if that trick were used, people could be prosecuted for uttering
sounds that happen to sound like "hate speech".  See the problem?  Of
course you don't.
I think you're being intentionally dense here.
This isn't people tweeting "build a wall", it's throwing abuse at a
specific individual.
95%, you might have a point.  but I suspect you are really only referring
to the opinions objected to by (at most) 51% of the population, or in fact
far less.  (Say, speech objected to by 75% of the PC crowd, or maybe 10% of
the population.)
There's no way we can objectively measure this, but I think your figures
are wrong.
49% may not object to you tweeting "build a wall", but I think a much
smaller percentage would be happy with you (and others) racially abusing an
individual user (to pick an example). That's not "being PC", that's
thinking you're a prick for continually tweeting coon at a single user just
to see how they'll respond
their computer servers would melt down, or something, if HTML data with

make money.
attack them?   Or do you merely mean using speech that offends them?  If
the former, I don't see much of a problem.  If it is the latter, I see a
huge problem.
It *is* a little tricky to physically attack someone whilst on the
internet. But there are situations online that we consider worthy of the
term "attack". A DDoS Attack, for example, doesn't do any physical harm and
yet is still considered an attack. Why? Because it's a targeted and
deliberate attempt to interfere with operations.
If you're receiving thousands of abusive tweets sent specifically at you,
and/or those same people are filling your mailbox with the same, I'd call
that an attack. YMMV
based on the fact it's privately-owned.  However, that's a very imperfect
defense.  First, Twitter hasn't previously claimed that it has an
institutional bias.
You don't need to have previously expressed a public opinion on something
to suddenly find you don't agree with it.
Corporations (and media) aren't required to explicitly state whether
they're left or right leaning (which in some ways is a shame)
In the case of Twitter though, it's not like they haven't stated their
objections before -
- you'll have to forgive the somewhat PC tone of parts of that, I'm sure
google will find you examples closer to your tastes if needed
Twitter-like, but which openly engages in what we'd agree is hateful,
racist speech, and discriminates in employment.  If a person could use the
court system to try to shut them down, then it isn't purely a "private"
operation, is it?   It's subject to government regulation and control.  In
that case, I think that Twitter itself (following arguendo, the same logic)
should be subject to legal attack.
Now that's a complex area of law, and varies between countries. But, those
who were banned would (AFAIK) be perfectly at liberty to try and sue
Strange though, whenever something like this comes up, you sometimes hear
threats of legal action, but they're never followed through. It's almost as
if the complainers haven't got a case under law. Admittedly, it might well
be, of course, that the cards are unfairly stacked against them.
"left-wing" organization.  Now, apparently, it has.
See earlier comment - there's no requirement for them to have done so.
And just to be a little picky. In the rest of the world, Twitter are not a
left-wing organisation, nor are most of the US's "lefty" politicians much
further left than centre-right. But I take your point
that if there were any threats, I doubt they were credible at all.
That's a valid point (though I did say analogies were flawed). Receiving
those kind of threats is undoubtedly unpleasant, but you're right, they
shouldn't lead to quite the same fear for safety as in my scenario.
On the other hand, I could understand someone fearing that they were just
the beginning. The person sending them might not, physically, be able to
reach you themselves, but the next step might be swatting. But, to be fair,
at that point we're away from speech and well into real-world actions.
half accross the world saying he'll kill you? Your own account probably not
giving any real info about you either.
It's scary the amount of information people do put online, though most at
least have the sense to not publicly post their address. That's often not
enough, though. Both corporations and governments seem to take a laid back
approach to protecting the data they're given (and in the case of govt, the
data they compel us to give them), so with various leaks floating about
there's always the possibility that information can be gathered. Again,
though, I'll conceded that that's a seperate issue
out was essential.
There's definitely groups of people (some of those Jim would probably
correctly identify as "PC") who seem to revel in the ability to block
dissenting views. An individual blocking someone else, at most, is only
harming their ability to learn something about the opposing view. But
others do try to take it further by trying to have "it" blocked at a wider
level by coercing government (or private orgs) to act.
I think, to an extent, it depends as much on how the provider behaves as it
does on userbase level. Although actual function would need to come into it
The platform that twitter provides is one that lets you "reach" millions of
people. In some ways, it's almost unrivalled, in the sense that it's (IMO)
far easier to stumble across someone new on Twitter than it is on FB etc.
Whether that's an essential service, obviously, is up for debate.
To some extent, yes.
Yes. But, not following you doesn't mean that you can't dump stuff into my
notifications by simply including an  If you've got many hundreds of

But I can still include you in mentions which'll end up in your

who is following you, so they can reply to them (which'll also ping me). A
DM would, at least, be hidden from your followers
If you look at Razers tweet earlier, you'll probably find he's not

At what point, in the online world, would you consider something becomes

Sorry, that wasn't my intention. I was hung over and trying to interpret
what exactly you actually meant by "service provider", as I wasn't entirely
clear whether you were viewing it as a utility or an essential service, so
I expounded a little on my thinking which has obviously made it less clear.
For a utility? That number seems reasonable to me
They almost certainly are, yes.
Yes, and with email you at least have the ability to set up some very
strict filters to try and limit what you receive. Until recently, Twitter
lacked even the beginnings of that - they've recently added the ability to
"mute" tweets based on keyword. Not tried it though so it might be crap.
I _think_ it's probably fair to say that the tools Twitter provide were
probably reasonable for how they envisioned the platform being used.
Whether through simple growth or lack of imagination, though, it is fairly
flawed if your aim is to filter things getting sent to you directly
In the case of Razer's tweet, we actually need to look at the reverse (so I
mis-stated it a bit).
Razer sent an unsolicited tweet to three people, all of whom are unlikely
to be following him. They'll have received a notification of the tweet.
If they don't like it, it's fairly simple, they just click to block Razer.
But, if every one of Razer's followers (as well as randoms who stumble over
the tweet) retweet it (or generate completely new tweets), they'll then get
new copies/notifications.
I can't actually remember for sure whether blocking on twitter does
anything with retweets. If you've blocked Razer and I retweet his tweet,
it's possible Twitter will see who the originator is and block it, but I've
a feeling that isn't the case.
"mentioning" a user like that is fairly routine on Twitter though, and if
you're replying to a tweet (that you've stumbled over by looking at
trending keywords, or whatever) the interface even drops a mention in for
anyone involved in that thread. So it's well within the ability of the
average user
Yes, I think that'd probably be a good idea. Blocking by "person" also
comes with the downside that the persistent will create and cycle new
profiles, being able top block based on some kind of algorithm would be
good. From a quick scan, it looks like the new muting ability goes some way
towards that - Course, it does mean that (in effect) you'll be the only person not to see
the tweets as they'll still be publicly available. That's obviously
different to dropping email at the edge, but it seems reasonable as it's
not that dissimilar to if those comments had been published on a blog.

At a point, that is something that's semi-reflected in law. If you look at
the anti-trust stuff, once a provider reaches a monopoly share on the
market, there are additional responsibilities that are enforced (though I'd
argue that actually, most of them seem to be obligations to "the market"
rather than to the user-base as such - they're predicated on the
fundamental idea that the free market solves all, which doesn't work so
well when the players are all bent in one way or another).
So there is a kind of precedence.
There are other obligations as well (like not dumping chemical waste in the
water supply), but IMO they're currently viewed more as rules imposed than
actual responsibilities (i.e. they seem to be dodged any time there's an
What they all seem to run up against is this myth that corporations have an
overwhelming responsibility to their share holders. It gets used as an
excuse to let common decency be overridden by the profit imperative.
Without finally putting that to rest (somehow), I don't think it matters
what responsibilities society says it expects from the corporations,
they'll simply be ignored when it suits.
Given that lawsuits are predicated on what the law says, if those ethics
aren't reflected in law, lawsuits aren't going to prevail. Seems to be the
case, at the moment, that even when they are, the punishment doesn't always
cost the corp more than they made from the breach.
No idea how we fix that though, the lawmaking structure is broken, and even
if it wasn't the laws that already exist get ignored or willfully
misinterpreted in pursuit of the next dime.
True, and you just named several "platforms" that those banned _could_ use
instead of Twitter.
In the context of it being like an action though, I'd say encouraging the
same flood of abuse would be more or less the same on all of those. The
tooling for dealing with it on each of those differs though, and I think
Twitter's probably at the bottom of the list in terms of means of stopping
it (assuming we accept that all-together leaving the service isn't an ideal
No, they said my request for money might be offensive to those who believe

As the very first comment on that slashdot post says, what reporter is
going to stop and do a whois before publishing the juicy, breaking news
they just stumbled on. Requiring real-names doesn't help with the issue,
but risks harming plenty. Having your contact details in a publicly
accessible database can lead to self-censorship through fear that
someone'll do a who-is and pay a visit (or coerce the local plod into
unwittingly doing so).
It was a land grab when ICANN tried it previously, and doesn't bring any
additional benefit now. It's funny though, how many years have we been
telling people to avoid putting personal details online, and still we're
seeing people trying to demand more.
Which (IMO) is part of what screwed Clinton over. If you look at the stuff
that came up in the final months, whilst damaging, it was all stuff that
she could probably have recovered from (the public being fairly fickle and
forgetting things quite quickly) had it come up earlier on.
Had the media broached it further on rather than trying to ignore it, they
could have helped the candidate they wanted to win to actually do so.
Instead they buried their heads in the sand and pretended there was nothing
to see, even as it became clearer and clearer that there was quite a lot
more to be told.
Whether you're happy or sad about Trump, I think it's fair to say the media
had quite a hand in putting him where he is today, even if that's the
opposite effect to the one they intended.

No-one's quite sure exactly which providers are going to be expected to

almost a given that consumer ISPs will be required to, but who else?

If you're going to do that, be very vocal about the business you would have

In particular, there's a good chance those companies won't be allowed to
disclose that they've had to comply. Warrant canaries arguably don't work
as well in the UK as (IIRC) you can be ordered to avoid doing anything that
might lead to disclosure of the order, which would include failing to
update the canary. At least, I recall reading that somewhere.
Theresa May's had a hard-on for this capability for years though, so
there's some serious determination behind seeing it all come to pass, so
it's going to be some time before common sense prevails (if ever)
