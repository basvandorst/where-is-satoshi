@_subject: Are there crypto discussions on this forum 
Hi, I am Igor Chudov, a great while ago I was involved in running this
mailing list via my proposal of a distributed list. Then junk messages
became too time consuming and I got busy.
I decided to subscribe to take a peek recently, and wanted to ask if
this mailing list has bona fide discussions of cryptography, its role
in the modern economy, finance and politics, etc.
