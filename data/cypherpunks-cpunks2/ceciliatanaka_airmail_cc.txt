Hi Hi !
END OF THE WEB:
Private Elite Club W3C Controls Future of Internet; Wants DRM for All
Web Content.
TL;DR: Web standards being developed by the W3C will make it difficult,
and legally dangerous for you to use any content (just video for now,
but it will expand to all web content) without the permission of the
owners, i.e., you want to make a commentary, redpill, meme, joke, etc.,
video containing literally any piece of data generated by someone else
(especially a corporation), e.g., part of an advertisement, news
broadcast, movie, tv show, jootube show, web article etc.?
Too bad. Internet’s over. Go home.
international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff,
and the public work together to develop Web standards. Led by Web
inventor Tim Berners-Lee (the pedofile who """invented the internet""")
and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe…" Members include hundreds of major corporations,
Universities, private individuals etc.
Early today, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) standards body publicly
announced its intention to publish Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) - a
DRM standard for web video - with no safeguards whatsoever for
accessibility, security research or competition, despite an
unprecedented internal controversy among its staff and members over this
EME is a standardized way for web video platforms to control users'
browsers, so that we can only watch the videos under rules they set.
This kind of technology, commonly called Digital Rights Management
(DRM), is backed up by laws like the United States DMCA Section 1201
(most other countries also have laws like this).
Under these laws, people who bypass DRM to do legal things (like
investigate code defects that create dangerous security vulnerabilities)
can face civil and criminal penalties. Practically speaking, bypassing
DRM isn't hard (Google's version of DRM was broken for six years before
anyone noticed), but that doesn't matter. Even low-quality DRM gets the
copyright owner the extremely profitable right to stop their customers
and competitors from using their products except in the ways that the
rightsholder specifies.
This will break people, companies, and projects, and it will be
technologists and their lawyers, including the EFF, who will be the ones
who'll have to pick up the pieces. We've seen what happens when people
and small startups face the wrath of giant corporations whose ire
they've aroused. We've seen those people bankrupted, jailed, and
personally destroyed.
At root is the way that DRM interacts with the law. Take security: the
W3C's specification says that users' computers should be protected from
privacy-invading activities by DRM vendors, but without a covenant, it's
impossible to check whether this is happening. Recall that GETflix, one
of the principal advocates for DRM at W3C, categorically rejected the
narrowest of covenants, one that would protect solely the activity of
revealing DRM flaws that compromised user privacy.
On the question of accessibility, the W3C has simply ignored the
substantial formal and informal objections raised by its members,
including members with deep expertise in accessibility, such as Vision
Australia, Media Access Australia, Benetech, and the RNIB. These
organizations pointed out that having a place for assistive data was
nice, but to make video accessible, it was necessary to use computers to
generate that data.
It's great to say that if you know where all the strobe effects are in
10,000,000 hours of videos, you could add warnings to the timelines of
those videos to help people with photosensitive epilepsy. But unless you
have an unimaginable army of people who can watch all that video, the
practical way to find all those strobes is to feed the video to a
computer, after bypassing the DRM. Otherwise, most video will never,
ever be made safe for people with photosensitive epilepsy.
Multiply that by the unimaginable armies of people needed to write
subtitles, translate audio, and generate descriptive audio tracks, and
you've exceeded the entire human race's video-annotating capacity
several times over—but barely scratched the surface of what computers
can (and will be able to) do.
So what exactly is this W3C, how do they operate, and who has a say in
what they’re doing? This jootube tech journalist guy (seems like a
typical, but earnest, nu male tech guy on jootube, not red pilled or
anything. Very normie audience I assume. But doing the only good
journalism on this topic outside the EFF.) uncovered something remarkable:
Vid summary: The W3C does not appear to be a legal entity of any kind.
It’s not an LLC, not a non-profit, not anything. It appears to be a
completely unofficial private club administered by  MIT
( the European Research Consortium for
Informatics ( Keio University in Tokyo
( and Beihang University in Beijing
( This unofficial private club collects tens of
millions of dollars annually from members (as can be calculated from the
member list and annual fees), who pay these fees in order to take part
in secret votes (the W3C does not publish vote records, meeting minutes,
or take any other measures to make it’s activities acceptable to the
public) that will shape the future of the internet. The W3C being an
apparently completely unofficial private club, there is no way to know
where this money goes. Tim Berners Lee (pedofile) could be spending it
all on *cheese pizza* for all anybody knows. Furthermore, because the
W3C is a legal non-entity, there’s no way for members of the public to
influence this organization, that controls the future of the web, other
than paying the fees and participating in the secret votes.

Previous video from the tech journalist summarizing the W3C DRM vote. He
attended a press event and has had some emails going back and forth with
the W3C trying to get more information:
Dig, punkanons. Dig for the only home we have left. For the internet!
Destroy this beast or be destroyed.
Also, we're organizing Internet users to meet with members of Congress,
in DC or locally, and we're helping to cover travel costs. Are you in?
aff...  :P
