I've used Mumble, with data transmission in UDP mode, on OpenVPN (in TCP
mode) through Tor. Given that you, or someone whom you trust, are
running the Mumble server, and that traffic is routed by VPN through
Tor, I believe that it's secure.
I think so. Because it can use UDP through the VPN tunnel, there's
virtually no break-up. Latency is high (1-2 seconds) but that's just a
fact of using Tor. Voice quality is better than typical cellphone.
Mumble was expressly designed for high-latency connections, so it has
good interactive tools for optimizing voice quality.
I've heard good things about Jabber. However, all SIP apps depend on
third party servers. And SIP servers are much harder to set up than
Mumble servers.

@_subject: surveillance, its proponents and its opponents 
There are trade-offs between privacy and accountability. In the interest
of social justice, there must be accountability for those who possess
authority and power. That does entail reduced privacy, but that's just a
cost of having authority and power. The degree of accountability (and
loss of privacy) should be proportionate to the authority and power
Conversely, those without particular authority and power deserve maximal
privacy, except in areas where they are accountable. Common examples
include driving vehicles and parenting children.

authority and power, and to ensure that it's truly legitimate.

I've followed this stuff for 20 years, and I'm a fairly technical guy,
so broadly speaking, there weren't many surprises. Indeed, although the
NSA has immense resources, Google is far more technical. According to
Silicon Jungle, the NSA hired Google to build the search component of
XKeyscore ;)
Maybe the nature hasn't changed, but the effectiveness has. For example,
Google encrypted its data center interlinks. I'm sure that others are
locking down their shit too.
Well, the NSA certainly can. And China is coming up fast.
But individuals lack structures for cooperation. That's a hard problem.

This is a different issue. As I read the Perspecsys piece, it's about
protecting Russian users' data from the NSA etc, and not about censoring
online activity.
Good VPN services don't store any user data, and so should be exempt :)
But then again, maybe they'll just be blocked :(
Yes, the rebirth of CryptoCloud :)
Also  and Well, VPN services have become more popular, and have proliferated
enormously. Also Tor. But yes, many remain unenlightened.
One can tunnel OpenVPN through SSH, stunnel or obfsproxy to evade
blocks. Obfsproxy has the most potential, I think, given the efforts of
the Tor Project.
At some point, it may be necessary to use covert channels :(
I'm not so comfortable with sharing my participation in P2P networks
with local observers. Even if adversaries couldn't censor me or see my
activity, they would know what group(s) I'm part of. I'd rather make
them work (at least a little) to see all that.

So it would be prudent to use pseudonyms, and to access via some mix of
VPN(s), JonDonym and Tor (according to ones need for anonymity vs
speed). And using devices with removable local storage, there would be
no traces to be inspected by adversaries.

I'm curious what you (and others here) think about Keybase, which also
seems heavily targeted at normal users. There was some discussion here
in mid 2014, but Keybase has been tweaked a lot since then. I'm quite
impressed with its usability, but I don't have the expertise to properly
evaluate its security. I am uncomfortable with the option of uploading
private GnuPG keys, and counting on symmetric encryption for securing
them. Better I think would be helping users understand how to properly
migrate keys between devices, or perhaps to use smartcards.

Given how many nations are recreating their stuff to protect their
citizens' data from NSA etc, the Russian efforts are not unusual. But of
course Russia has a long history of social repression. One can argue
that it's all defensive, and driven by fear of the Allies. Or instead,
one can argue that it's just Russian mafia/oligarchs protecting their
turf and sheeple. Reality is probably some mix of all that, with maybe
even some idealism thrown in.

@_subject: Gnupg (gpg) [was Re: Pond and Keybase [was peerio.com]] 
OK, I'll bite :)
Well, correspondents ought to:
1) always use pseudonyms if they care about attribution;
2) avoid meaningful subject lines; and
3) use VPNs, JonDonym and Tor to obscure network connectivity.
Given that, why care that adversaries see OpenPGP?
So what? Just secure your shit properly!
Smart folk who care about attribution never put anything online that
links their pseudonyms to their real names. Just sayin'. And they rotate
their pseudonyms periodically. So stored messages go stale within a year
or two, tops.
That's prudent for stuff that matters. But OpenPGP is still good within
the transport layers.
I've never used WoT, and tend to agree. WoT is especially impractical
because I don't at all mix meatspace and online activity. I am starting
to like Keybase, however.
I don't worry very much about sharing publicly who my conversation
partners are. I always use pseudonyms, and so do many of my conversation
partners. Sometimes we all use multiple pseudonyms, just for fun :)
Again, use those pseudonyms!
Having my pseudonyms profiled doesn't worry me greatly.
Why bother? Just set up a Tor hidden-service forum, or whatever.
I use both IMAP and POP, and I've never seen plaintext drafts stored on

As I understand it, Keybase is an API. The website/service is merely a
demonstration. The developers are aiming for mass adoption, and so
they've targeted the most popular sites. With some coding, arbitrary
sites could be used, with two requirements. First, it must be possible
for users to post persistent signed proofs. Second, it must be possible
for the API to access those signed proofs, in order to verify them.
That's the value of trackers. Those tracking such a comprised target
would see that various public signed proofs are no longer valid for the
target's key on Keybase. The adversary could alter all of the target's
public signed proofs. But even that wouldn't suffice, because trackers
have independent snapshot histories of public proofs. And furthermore,
snapshot histories are embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain.
Signed proofs could be placed anywhere that's accessible to the API. But
that takes coding, and developers have priorities. One can request.
Anyway, I've created a test identity:  Once
I've added enough proofs, and have enough trackers, I plan to mess with
it by replacing the public key held by Keybase, altering some of the
proofs, and so on. Then we can see how that shows up for its trackers,
and for other users. I'll also explore impacts of malicious trackers.

Also  and Well, VPN services have become more popular, and have proliferated

One can tunnel OpenVPN through SSH, stunnel or obfsproxy to evade

the Tor Project.

Smart folk who care about attribution never put anything online that

That's prudent for stuff that matters. But OpenPGP is still good within

or even on the fingerprint, but rather on an identity that's multiply
and independently authenticated.
I hide in many ways, and don't depend on message encryption ;) My
"preferences, habits and political views" are fragmented among multiple
unlinked personas. How to do that is one of my key soapbox topics ;)
Again, it's a tool. But of course it's not the only tool.

@_subject: Keybase 
Hash: SHA1
As I understand it, Keybase is an API. The website/service is merely a
demonstration. The developers are aiming for mass adoption, and so
they've targeted the most popular sites. With some coding, arbitrary
sites could be used, with two requirements. First, it must be possible
for users to post persistent signed proofs. Second, it must be possible
for the API to access those signed proofs, in order to verify them.
That's the value of trackers. Those tracking such a comprised target
would see that various public signed proofs are no longer valid for the
target's key on Keybase. The adversary could alter all of the target's
public signed proofs. But even that wouldn't suffice, because trackers
have independent snapshot histories of public proofs. And furthermore,
snapshot histories are embedded in the Bitcoin blockchain.
Signed proofs could be placed anywhere that's accessible to the API. But
that takes coding, and developers have priorities. One can request.
Anyway, I've created a test identity:  Once
I've added enough proofs, and have enough trackers, I plan to mess with
it by replacing the public key held by Keybase, altering some of the
proofs, and so on. Then we can see how that shows up for its trackers,
and for other users. I'll also explore impacts of malicious trackers.

I don't see this as an issue for processors and distributors, as long as
their OPSEC is adequate. We may prudently assume that Snowden's
originals were tagged, watermarked, implanted, and so on. Given that, I
trust that everyone working with the documents has behaved accordingly.
If they haven't, it's all too likely that identities and relationships
have been inadvertently been revealed. Son las cosas de la vida.
But for casual enthusiasts and the general public, this could be a
serious issue. Even if documents were obtained securely, they could
phone home. Scans by anti-malware apps could be uploaded to servers.
Cloud-backup providers might look for them. ...
How might one prevent that? What comes to mind is a Tor hidden-service
site that serves scrubbed images, and doesn't readily permit downloads.
While OCR would be essential in processing documents, serving text
arguably puts users at risk. Maybe that's obvious.

I don't use smartphones, and so don't know what works best. Searching on

iOS. AIMSICD looks like a good app. Maybe someone who knows this stuff
well can recommend one.
For the Faraday bag, see

test. Just put the phone in the bag, and call it. If it rings, there are
The hardest aspect is getting good electrical contact on all seams,
including the access flap. The maximum dimension of any hole in the bag
must be small, less than an inch. A gap at the seam that's an inch long,
even if it's very narrow, will leak a lot.
The other thing to keep in mind is that aluminum foil gets brittle with
bending, and will crack. So you need multiple layers, and the layers
must be in electrical contact. Narrow strips of double-stick tape
between layers are OK to provide structural stability. But it's a trade-off.

I don't know enough about smartphones to say. The effectiveness of
removing the battery may vary among devices. Snowden told people
visiting him in Hong Kong to put their phones in the refrigerator, which
is a Faraday cage. Also, using a bag is arguably less hassle than
removing the battery.

Some think that removing the battery, or even turning the phone off or
putting it in "airplane mode", is enough. Maybe I'm too paranoid, but I
don't trust either of those approaches.
However, I do agree that taking one of those steps before putting the
phone in the Faraday bag will prevent rapid battery discharge through
high-power attempts to reach towers.

You just need blockchains for anonymizing spending. Even the current

That's excellent advice ... to someone who owns the machine. I'd say

OK, stealth is the only option. The first requirement is a safe place
for communicating, researching, and downloading stuff. Doing that on a
compromised machine is most likely pointless.
I know nothing about parental monitoring software. But one could get a
good sense of its universe from searching.[0] Task Manager shows what's
running, but Process Explorer is much more informative.[1] It doesn't
require installation, or admin rights to run, and one can run it from a
USB flash drive. Its use will be logged, of course, but at least it
won't show up as an installed program.
Right click on processes of interest, and select Properties. The
Environment tab shows where logs etc might be found. The TCP/IP tab
shows network activity and remote IPs/hosts.
If there is stuff that requires admin rights to see, and there is some
private time, booting with a Linux LiveCD would be useful. makeuseof
recommends Hiren’s BootCD, The Ultimate Boot CD, and Knoppix.[2]
If there's no evidence of sophisticated efforts, it might be worth using
Portable VirtualBox[3,4] and a Ubuntu VM with LUKS.[5] However, using
Portable VirtualBox would likely require admin rights to install
drivers. It's fairly trivial to get admin rights in Windows.[6] And one
could reverse all changes after installing drivers needed for Portable
VirtualBox. But consequences of discovery might be painful.

I don't know enough about smartphones to say. The effectiveness of
removing the battery may vary among devices. Snowden told people
visiting him in Hong Kong to put their phones in the refrigerator, which
is a Faraday cage. Also, using a bag is arguably less hassle than
removing the battery.

I'm replying to my own post to add comments based on list feedback.
Some think that removing the battery, or even turning the phone off or
putting it in "airplane mode", is enough. Maybe I'm too paranoid, but I
don't trust either of those approaches.
However, I do agree that taking one of those steps before putting the
phone in the Faraday bag will prevent rapid battery discharge through
high-power attempts to reach towers.

Anyway, CMU's attack did manage to compromise some onion services, most
notably SR2.[0] And I'm not impressed with the Tor Project's
performance. They apparently ignored the CMU attack for five months.
Maybe they got blindsided by a zero day vulnerability. Or maybe they
just weren't paying enough attention.
But the SR2 connection came up in a comment, and there's no mea culpa
for the delay, just blame on CMU. It's stuff like this that fuels
conspiracy theories about Tor and the US military.
Also, your comment about port 80 makes no sense in this context. The CMU
attack deanonymized onion services, not users. And port 80 with onion
services is secure. It's non-encrypted traffic through exit nodes that's
insecure. There's no exit node when using onion services.

Yes, it was subtle. But it was also, as I understand it, pointless
except as an attack. And it was new behavior, right?
But still, it wasn't fair to say "ignored". They just didn't see it.
Right. And they apparently didn't start looking until the Black Hat talk
was announced. I did note that they might have been blindsided by a zero
day vulnerability.
I'm not technical enough to answer that. But generally, I think that
they ought to put more effort into monitoring. Especially for new
relays. Look for anything unusual.

true that the US military funded its development. And it's true that

Right. I was taking "the chinese" more as the Chinese people. Or
whoever's buying Bitcoin, anyway. But regarding the thread overall, I do
believe that the Chinese government is divesting US bonds. They don't
want to fuck up the US economy by doing that quickly. But they also
don't want their investments to be devalued as the US prints money, ever
faster and faster.
Long term, as I understand it, they plan for yuan to replace dollar as
global fiat. They do own lots of gold, but I don't recall anything about
going gold standard. If you have cites, that would be cool.
It's my impression that Chinese people are generally very into saving.
But judging by the stock craziness, they aren't very sane about what
they invest in. Gold has always been popular. Bitcoins were a fad for a
while, but that's cooled off since the Mt Gox bubble collapsed in early

Tor is open-source, and collaborative. Arguably, anyone with requisite
skills and resources can subvert it. But it is true that the Five Eyes
have the best resources for traffic analysis.
It's hard to say. Only idiots use tools with backdoors.
I don't believe that either Freenet or I2P are large enough to provide
strong anonymity. And both (along with most P2P systems) require that
nodes be discoverable. That complicates using them with VPNs and Tor.
It might be possible to run Freenet nodes as onion services. That works
well enough for Tahoe-LAFS. I've been meaning to test that. Also IPFS.
Well, adversaries can use malicious P2P nodes. It's true that Freenet is
about the same size as Tor ( vs
 But with Tor, what's
relevant is the number of possible circuits. With ~1700 entry guards,
~1000 exit relays and ~2300 non-entry/non-exit relays, about four

@_subject: Why cryptome sold web logs to their paying customers? 
Well, JYA apparently did send them to him :) Apparently by accident.
Are you arguing that users could have found those logs?
I almost can't imagine that. Logs are normally in /var/log/ somewhere,
and I can't imagine making them searchable. And indeed, I can't imagine
how Cryptome archives would have included anything from /var/log/, even
after system restore from backups.
If Mike had uploaded them without full inspection, no problem. But, as I
understand the narrative, he knowingly uploaded them. Yes, he asked JYA
about it first. And yes, he posted to this list too. But in the end,
after getting no help, he went ahead and uploaded them.
And that, in my opinion, was unwarranted.
That is on JYA's tab, for sure ;)
As much as I hate waiting on the team reviewing Snowden's cache, I
generally agree on the importance of redaction to protect innocents.
Wikileaks redacts too. That's the lesson here, in my opinion.
True. We're all responsible for our own OPSEC.
But that's the thing. Logs should have been in /var/log/. And how would
the "NetSol total restore" have changed that?
I still don't get how logs would have ended up in archives. Maybe JYA
prepared a special set of archives for a collaborator. Maybe for someone
helping him to understand what had happened. And then maybe he forgot
about doing that. Hard to say.
I don't quite get what this is such a big deal. I've always assumed that
the Five Eyes etc intercept everything that they can. But there are so
many possible sources. Maybe GCHQ got the data from JYA's ISP. Or maybe
from their ISP. Or maybe from Cryptome archives. Or maybe from a bunch
of sources. Am I missing something here?
So what is the point?

Does "when" mean "before" or "after"? But I take your clarification.

Also, just to be clear, here's how I would have handled this. So I have
these Cryptome archives. And I upload them to the Internet Archive. And
then I notice that [what the fuck!] they include weblogs! And so I
contact the Internet Archive, and make sure that they don't propagate my
upload. Then I remove the weblogs from the Cryptome archives, and upload
them to the Internet Archive. Then I email JYA etc etc etc.
For whatever that's worth ;)

Discussion in OK, so local realism is dead. But what is it? An excerpt from above:
And here's the tl;dr:
Another chunk:
Me, I like the many worlds interpretation. But it's just an
interpretation. What matters is the math.

@_date: 2016-08-05 13:56:15
@_author: Mirimir 
@_subject: Quantum entangled-photon Chinese satellite. 
First you create entangled electrons in two distant diamonds [separated
by 1.5 km in Hensen et al. (2015) and apparently 750 mi in the
Chinese-Austrian experiment described in the news article]. You do that
by exchanging photons, which travel at light-speed or less. Then you
measure the spins of those entangled electrons. And you find that the
spins are correlated in a way that's predicted by quantum mechanics, but
would be possible under classical mechanics (aka realism) only if the
entangled electrons could communicate at greater than light-speed.
So basically, they find that the classical model of reality is fucked.
Here's the abstract from Hensen et al. (2015)
The news article is full of bullshit.
As I understand it, they're just pushing the separation to 750 miles.
We're still a long way from transmitting useful data. And recall that
creating entanglement requires synchronization at light-speed or less.
In saying that it's dull, they're pointing out that what matters is the
math of quantum mechanics. It's just math. Equations. There's no mental
model, no story in words about how reality works. The interpretations
are just stories.

@_subject: Quantum entangled-photon Chinese satellite. 
I'm just explaining what Hensen et al. (2015)
 reported. Read the damn paper if you
don't like my explanation. But read
 first ;)
The problem with classical mechanics is that it's not consistent with
measurements. Quantum mechanics is. The equations. According to the
Copenhagen interpretation, only the math matters. I don't like it any
more than you seem to. Because I'm not a mathematician.
But many worlds is very cool :) Read Stephenson's _Anathem_.
You must be a local realist ;)

than 13.7 nanoseconds, to achieve that interference.
OK, so they've shown that reality (for lack of a better word) cannot be
both realistic (as in classical mechanics) and locally constrained (as
in inability of information to travel faster than light speed). But that
is just what quantum mechanics (a bunch of math) predicts.
That is, one of realism and locality must be wrong.
One interpretation is that spacial separation is just an illusion.

@_date: 2016-08-06 08:41:13
@_author: Mirimir 
@_subject: Quantum entangled-photon Chinese satellite. 
Well, it's actually the electrons that are entangled. The photons are
just messengers. But yes, that's how I understand it. Wave functions
collapse faster than light speed.
There is no "isolate" in this model ;)

@_subject: Quantum entangled-photon Chinese satellite. 
The fucking paper that I've cited. And more generally, all experiments
that reject the null hypothesis that the outcome of the CHSH game is 75%
or less.
Quantum mechanics is math. It makes predictions about reality that can
be tested. By experiments where stuff gets measured.
The problem is that some predictions of quantum mechanics, such as this
stuff about entanglement, 1) have been verified experimentally, but 2)
don't make obvious sense. That is, a wave function comprising two
entangled electrons can apparently collapse instantaneously, even though
the electrons are arbitrarily far apart. You could try to give up light
as a universal speed limit. But that creates other paradoxes.

I think that's the next bit that you didn't quote:
You can establish that both observers saw an entangled wave function
collapse, after the fact. But before the wave function collapses,
neither one can know what they'll see, and so they also can't know what
the other will see.

@_date: 2016-08-07 11:23:55
@_author: Mirimir 
@_subject: Quantum entangled-photon Chinese satellite. 
No, there's no "prediction". They can discover later that both sides saw
the expected spins. It's vaguely like you're flipping coins, and someone
on Mars is also flipping coins. And later you share notes, and find that
you both got more or less the same sequence of heads and tails. Not
perfect, but substantially better than chance. But neither side can
choose the order of heads and tails, so they can't create messages.
It's entangled electrons in diamonds, not photons. And you can only test
each pair of entangled electrons once. Because after that, they're no
longer entangled.
As I understand it, no information transfer is possible.

First you create entangled electrons in two distant diamonds [separated
by 1.5 km in Hensen et al. (2015) and apparently 750 mi in the
Chinese-Austrian experiment described in the news article]. You do that
by exchanging photons, which travel at light-speed or less. Then you
measure the spins of those entangled electrons. And you find that the
spins are correlated in a way that's predicted by quantum mechanics, but
would be possible under classical mechanics (aka realism) only if the
entangled electrons could communicate at greater than light-speed.
So basically, they find that the classical model of reality is fucked.
Here's the abstract from Hensen et al. (2015)
The news article is full of bullshit.
As I understand it, they're just pushing the separation to 750 miles.
We're still a long way from transmitting useful data. And recall that
creating entanglement requires synchronization at light-speed or less.
In saying that it's dull, they're pointing out that what matters is the
math of quantum mechanics. It's just math. Equations. There's no mental
model, no story in words about how reality works. The interpretations
are just stories.

The problem with classical mechanics is that it's not consistent with
measurements. Quantum mechanics is. The equations. According to the
Copenhagen interpretation, only the math matters. I don't like it any
more than you seem to. Because I'm not a mathematician.
But many worlds is very cool :) Read Stephenson's _Anathem_.

than 13.7 nanoseconds, to achieve that interference.
OK, so they've shown that reality (for lack of a better word) cannot be
both realistic (as in classical mechanics) and locally constrained (as
in inability of information to travel faster than light speed). But that
is just what quantum mechanics (a bunch of math) predicts.
That is, one of realism and locality must be wrong.
One interpretation is that spacial separation is just an illusion.

Well, it's actually the electrons that are entangled. The photons are

collapse faster than light speed.

The fucking paper that I've cited. And more generally, all experiments
that reject the null hypothesis that the outcome of the CHSH game is 75%

Quantum mechanics is math. It makes predictions about reality that can
be tested. By experiments where stuff gets measured.
The problem is that some predictions of quantum mechanics, such as this
stuff about entanglement, 1) have been verified experimentally, but 2)
don't make obvious sense. That is, a wave function comprising two
entangled electrons can apparently collapse instantaneously, even though
the electrons are arbitrarily far apart. You could try to give up light
as a universal speed limit. But that creates other paradoxes.

I think that's the next bit that you didn't quote:

No, there's no "prediction". They can discover later that both sides saw
the expected spins. It's vaguely like you're flipping coins, and someone

you both got more or less the same sequence of heads and tails. Not
perfect, but substantially better than chance. But neither side can
choose the order of heads and tails, so they can't create messages.
It's entangled electrons in diamonds, not photons. And you can only test
each pair of entangled electrons once. Because after that, they're no
longer entangled.
As I understand it, no information transfer is possible.

Arguing about anthropogenic climate forcing is just fucking useless. The

Right, that will likely be a major factor. I'm betting that we'll see
regional forest burn-offs, as precipitation shifts away from the
equator. Amazon will become grasslands and desert. Africa too.
Migration will be a bitch. Maybe US and EU will nuke strategically to

Anyway, oshwm also noted that, with strong encryption, you _and_ Windows
both become weak links. See below about Windows.
Right. Against resourceful adversaries, anonymity arguably becomes as
important as strong encryption. If they know who to coerce, it doesn't
matter so much that they can't break the encryption.
The problem with Windows is that there's no way to know what it logs,
what information it sends, or where it sends it. So it's impossible to
keep anything reliably private. Not your identity. Not any encryption
credentials. Nothing is private.
So sure, it's probably "easier to persuade someone to install an add-in
than to learn Linux". But would that be helping them, or putting them at
greater risk, through false belief in privacy and security?
I do agree that it's unrealistic to expect most people to dual-boot
Windows and Linux. Or to devote a computer to Linux. But installing
VirtualBox in Windows is trivial, and most Linux VMs only need 1GB RAM.

I guess. But damn, an up-to-date English version makes more sense to me.
My current working hypothesis is that Tor is not broken/breakable by
design. But I've become increasingly concerned by the continuing
emphasis on Tor browser (easy to install but easily compromised) and
omission of Whonix (harder to install but much harder to compromise). It
is arguable that ease of use trumps strong protection, in that there's
greater net benefit. But less charitably, maybe the need for numerous
users to hide among trumps everything else.

Well, say "technically inexperienced" if you like. In my world, we
call that "clueless". I'm more or less clueless in many areas, and am
not ashamed to admit it.
Well, given what we know of TLA capabilities, what Tor Project says at
 is tantamount to false advertising:
Maybe so against local adversaries. But clearly not against global
adversaries. Cynical folk note that so far, the US and its allies are
the only known global adversary. And claim that this is self-serving
It for sure hasn't stopped FBI, with their honeypots that drop
malware. And I doubt that it stops NSA/GCHQ. But Tor Project just
postures about "bad FBI". They don't give naive users, who may be at
risk, even a brief heads up about proxy leakage, and how to prevent it.
Two or three years ago, even after the Freedom Hosting debacle, I was
willing to cut Tor Project some slack. But after the PlayPen attack,
it's becoming harder to escape the conclusion that Tor Project either
doesn't want to mitigate this risk, or doesn't have the contractual
freedom to do so.
Fair enough :)
It's my general impression that Whonix project has been actively
rebuffed. But I have no inside knowledge.
Yes, that does seem to be the case. But asking hasn't gotten me
anywhere. Maybe some fly on the wall will dump some evidence ;)
I don't disagree that they're different issues. My point is that
warning users about proxy bypass takes but a few words on a website,
and maybe a link. And given that it's such an easy fix, I suspect that
Tor Project either doesn't want to admit the risk so clearly, or is
somehow being prevented from doing so.
It's been at least five years! The relay early bug got fixed in
months. Maybe devs are working on some integrated firewall or
whatever. That would be cool. But Whonix isn't vulnerable, has been
available for years, and gets no love. And it's not just Whonix. Other
approaches that separate tor process and userland have also been
largely ignored.
Which VPNs have received NSLs?
Anyway, I don't assume that a particular VPN operator can be trusted
any more than a particular Tor relay operator can. Just as Tor uses
three-relay circuits, I recommend using nested VPN chains, with at
least three different VPNs, operating in different jurisdictions.
Some useful links:

I'd say "meta" rather than "sideways", but hey ;)
Well, Whonix uses stock Tor browser, with a tweak to keep it from
launching its own local tor process. It also enforces stream
separation for other apps. But the key thing here is that it prevents
proxy bypass.
Yes, they are for sure not that line. So why not acknowledge that?
Maybe key funders have said no to that.
Right. For most, Tor browser on Windows. Pwnage waiting to happen.
But why does Tor Project care about captured audience dependency?
People using Whonix, like people using Tails, are still using Tor. And
still using stock Tor browser.
Maybe goals of key funders are driving this. Deliver lots of Tor
relays and users to hide our agents. But make sure that users can't
hide from our TLAs. That's what language in Graham's appropriations
bill says. Maybe that's been the backroom deal for years, and Tor
Project has been pushing back. One does get that sense from the leaked
IRC logs.
I doubt that they hire anons :(

He's not my friend, Juan. He works for the fucking US Navy, after all.
But I do respect him. Think about it. He and his friends got US military
funding for a project that provided deniable and secure communication,
but only by making it public, for use by both funders and their enemies.
It might be that this vulnerability was crucial for selling it to US
military. But that's distinguishable from the argument that it's
intentionally designed to be vulnerable. There's also the fact that
nobody has come up with anything practical that's not vulnerable to
global adversaries. So it seems unlikely that he had such a design that
he put aside as unsellable.

If Tor were actually secure, I could accept that US government uses it

anyone from using anonymity systems without backdoors.

What you say is possible. But none of us actually know how bad it is.
Except, of course, for those with privileged information about US
military capabilities ;)
Tor Project says:
You warn people not to use Tor, because it's useless against US
military. And as I recall, you also reject Tor on moral grounds, because
US military uses it for evil.
I consider both positions to be irresponsible. Conning people into using
Tor recklessly, with insecure setups, is at best irresponsible. If the
goal is cover traffic for US military, it's malicious.
But frightening people from using Tor, when there are no viable
alternatives, is also at best irresponsible. Even if Tor is more or less
useless against US military, it still protects users against other
adversaries. And arguably it even protects most users from US military,
if only because they're not important enough to focus on.
Putting it in caps doesn't make it right :)
I disagree about backdoors generally.
But specifically about vulnerability of Tor to global adversaries, you
may be right. But also you may be wrong.
Actually, they pretty much invented it ;)

If he had done it without Tor, he would have been in jail a lot sooner!
It is likely that he pushed his luck too far using Tor.
Nested VPN chains are also vulnerable to global adversaries. It may be
that all low-latency anonymity systems that can scale to many users are
vulnerable to global adversaries.
Yes, we do keep coming back to the same circular discussion, don't we?
I'm concerned that Tor is pwned by US military, but I'm not convinced

That's not really a backdoor. You argue that Tor is vulnerable to global
adversaries, and was designed that way. But it's not just Tor. It seems
that all low-latency anonymity systems that scale to numerous users are
vulnerable to global adversaries.
I'm just saying that you don't know for sure. You may think that you do.
But there's just too much uncertainty. You said as much in another

that eliminates states' power monopoly. Maybe it'll be the Singularity.

I guess. But damn, an up-to-date English version makes more sense to me.
My current working hypothesis is that Tor is not broken/breakable by
design. But I've become increasingly concerned by the continuing
emphasis on Tor browser (easy to install but easily compromised) and
omission of Whonix (harder to install but much harder to compromise). It
is arguable that ease of use trumps strong protection, in that there's
greater net benefit. But less charitably, maybe the need for numerous
users to hide among trumps everything else.

Well, say "technically inexperienced" if you like. In my world, we
call that "clueless". I'm more or less clueless in many areas, and am
not ashamed to admit it.
Well, given what we know of TLA capabilities, what Tor Project says at
 is tantamount to false advertising:
Maybe so against local adversaries. But clearly not against global
adversaries. Cynical folk note that so far, the US and its allies are
the only known global adversary. And claim that this is self-serving
It for sure hasn't stopped FBI, with their honeypots that drop
malware. And I doubt that it stops NSA/GCHQ. But Tor Project just
postures about "bad FBI". They don't give naive users, who may be at
risk, even a brief heads up about proxy leakage, and how to prevent it.
Two or three years ago, even after the Freedom Hosting debacle, I was
willing to cut Tor Project some slack. But after the PlayPen attack,
it's becoming harder to escape the conclusion that Tor Project either
doesn't want to mitigate this risk, or doesn't have the contractual
freedom to do so.
Fair enough :)
It's my general impression that Whonix project has been actively
rebuffed. But I have no inside knowledge.
Yes, that does seem to be the case. But asking hasn't gotten me
anywhere. Maybe some fly on the wall will dump some evidence ;)
I don't disagree that they're different issues. My point is that
warning users about proxy bypass takes but a few words on a website,
and maybe a link. And given that it's such an easy fix, I suspect that
Tor Project either doesn't want to admit the risk so clearly, or is
somehow being prevented from doing so.
It's been at least five years! The relay early bug got fixed in
months. Maybe devs are working on some integrated firewall or
whatever. That would be cool. But Whonix isn't vulnerable, has been
available for years, and gets no love. And it's not just Whonix. Other
approaches that separate tor process and userland have also been
largely ignored.
Which VPNs have received NSLs?
Anyway, I don't assume that a particular VPN operator can be trusted
any more than a particular Tor relay operator can. Just as Tor uses
three-relay circuits, I recommend using nested VPN chains, with at
least three different VPNs, operating in different jurisdictions.
Some useful links:

I'd say "meta" rather than "sideways", but hey ;)
Well, Whonix uses stock Tor browser, with a tweak to keep it from
launching its own local tor process. It also enforces stream
separation for other apps. But the key thing here is that it prevents
proxy bypass.
Yes, they are for sure not that line. So why not acknowledge that?
Maybe key funders have said no to that.
Right. For most, Tor browser on Windows. Pwnage waiting to happen.
But why does Tor Project care about captured audience dependency?
People using Whonix, like people using Tails, are still using Tor. And
still using stock Tor browser.
Maybe goals of key funders are driving this. Deliver lots of Tor
relays and users to hide our agents. But make sure that users can't
hide from our TLAs. That's what language in Graham's appropriations
bill says. Maybe that's been the backroom deal for years, and Tor
Project has been pushing back. One does get that sense from the leaked
IRC logs.
I doubt that they hire anons :(

He's not my friend, Juan. He works for the fucking US Navy, after all.
But I do respect him. Think about it. He and his friends got US military
funding for a project that provided deniable and secure communication,
but only by making it public, for use by both funders and their enemies.
It might be that this vulnerability was crucial for selling it to US
military. But that's distinguishable from the argument that it's
intentionally designed to be vulnerable. There's also the fact that
nobody has come up with anything practical that's not vulnerable to
global adversaries. So it seems unlikely that he had such a design that
he put aside as unsellable.

anyone from using anonymity systems without backdoors.

What you say is possible. But none of us actually know how bad it is.
Except, of course, for those with privileged information about US
military capabilities ;)
Tor Project says:
You warn people not to use Tor, because it's useless against US
military. And as I recall, you also reject Tor on moral grounds, because
US military uses it for evil.
I consider both positions to be irresponsible. Conning people into using
Tor recklessly, with insecure setups, is at best irresponsible. If the
goal is cover traffic for US military, it's malicious.
But frightening people from using Tor, when there are no viable
alternatives, is also at best irresponsible. Even if Tor is more or less
useless against US military, it still protects users against other
adversaries. And arguably it even protects most users from US military,
if only because they're not important enough to focus on.
Putting it in caps doesn't make it right :)
I disagree about backdoors generally.
But specifically about vulnerability of Tor to global adversaries, you
may be right. But also you may be wrong.

If he had done it without Tor, he would have been in jail a lot sooner!
It is likely that he pushed his luck too far using Tor.
Nested VPN chains are also vulnerable to global adversaries. It may be
that all low-latency anonymity systems that can scale to many users are
vulnerable to global adversaries.
Yes, we do keep coming back to the same circular discussion, don't we?
I'm concerned that Tor is pwned by US military, but I'm not convinced

They did succeed in taking down the Soviet Union, by forcing it to

I guess. But damn, an up-to-date English version makes more sense to me.
My current working hypothesis is that Tor is not broken/breakable by
design. But I've become increasingly concerned by the continuing
emphasis on Tor browser (easy to install but easily compromised) and
omission of Whonix (harder to install but much harder to compromise). It
is arguable that ease of use trumps strong protection, in that there's
greater net benefit. But less charitably, maybe the need for numerous
users to hide among trumps everything else.

Well, say "technically inexperienced" if you like. In my world, we
call that "clueless". I'm more or less clueless in many areas, and am
not ashamed to admit it.
Well, given what we know of TLA capabilities, what Tor Project says at
 is tantamount to false advertising:
Maybe so against local adversaries. But clearly not against global
adversaries. Cynical folk note that so far, the US and its allies are
the only known global adversary. And claim that this is self-serving
It for sure hasn't stopped FBI, with their honeypots that drop
malware. And I doubt that it stops NSA/GCHQ. But Tor Project just
postures about "bad FBI". They don't give naive users, who may be at
risk, even a brief heads up about proxy leakage, and how to prevent it.
Two or three years ago, even after the Freedom Hosting debacle, I was
willing to cut Tor Project some slack. But after the PlayPen attack,
it's becoming harder to escape the conclusion that Tor Project either
doesn't want to mitigate this risk, or doesn't have the contractual
freedom to do so.
Fair enough :)
It's my general impression that Whonix project has been actively
rebuffed. But I have no inside knowledge.
Yes, that does seem to be the case. But asking hasn't gotten me
anywhere. Maybe some fly on the wall will dump some evidence ;)
I don't disagree that they're different issues. My point is that
warning users about proxy bypass takes but a few words on a website,
and maybe a link. And given that it's such an easy fix, I suspect that
Tor Project either doesn't want to admit the risk so clearly, or is
somehow being prevented from doing so.
It's been at least five years! The relay early bug got fixed in
months. Maybe devs are working on some integrated firewall or
whatever. That would be cool. But Whonix isn't vulnerable, has been
available for years, and gets no love. And it's not just Whonix. Other
approaches that separate tor process and userland have also been
largely ignored.
Which VPNs have received NSLs?
Anyway, I don't assume that a particular VPN operator can be trusted
any more than a particular Tor relay operator can. Just as Tor uses
three-relay circuits, I recommend using nested VPN chains, with at
least three different VPNs, operating in different jurisdictions.
Some useful links:

I'd say "meta" rather than "sideways", but hey ;)
Well, Whonix uses stock Tor browser, with a tweak to keep it from
launching its own local tor process. It also enforces stream
separation for other apps. But the key thing here is that it prevents
proxy bypass.
Yes, they are for sure not that line. So why not acknowledge that?
Maybe key funders have said no to that.
Right. For most, Tor browser on Windows. Pwnage waiting to happen.
But why does Tor Project care about captured audience dependency?
People using Whonix, like people using Tails, are still using Tor. And
still using stock Tor browser.
Maybe goals of key funders are driving this. Deliver lots of Tor
relays and users to hide our agents. But make sure that users can't
hide from our TLAs. That's what language in Graham's appropriations
bill says. Maybe that's been the backroom deal for years, and Tor
Project has been pushing back. One does get that sense from the leaked
IRC logs.
I doubt that they hire anons :(

He's not my friend, Juan. He works for the fucking US Navy, after all.
But I do respect him. Think about it. He and his friends got US military
funding for a project that provided deniable and secure communication,
but only by making it public, for use by both funders and their enemies.
It might be that this vulnerability was crucial for selling it to US
military. But that's distinguishable from the argument that it's
intentionally designed to be vulnerable. There's also the fact that
nobody has come up with anything practical that's not vulnerable to
global adversaries. So it seems unlikely that he had such a design that
he put aside as unsellable.

What you say is possible. But none of us actually know how bad it is.
Except, of course, for those with privileged information about US
military capabilities ;)
Tor Project says:
You warn people not to use Tor, because it's useless against US
military. And as I recall, you also reject Tor on moral grounds, because
US military uses it for evil.
I consider both positions to be irresponsible. Conning people into using
Tor recklessly, with insecure setups, is at best irresponsible. If the
goal is cover traffic for US military, it's malicious.
But frightening people from using Tor, when there are no viable
alternatives, is also at best irresponsible. Even if Tor is more or less
useless against US military, it still protects users against other
adversaries. And arguably it even protects most users from US military,
if only because they're not important enough to focus on.
Putting it in caps doesn't make it right :)
I disagree about backdoors generally.
But specifically about vulnerability of Tor to global adversaries, you
may be right. But also you may be wrong.

If he had done it without Tor, he would have been in jail a lot sooner!
It is likely that he pushed his luck too far using Tor.
Nested VPN chains are also vulnerable to global adversaries. It may be
that all low-latency anonymity systems that can scale to many users are
vulnerable to global adversaries.
Yes, we do keep coming back to the same circular discussion, don't we?
I'm concerned that Tor is pwned by US military, but I'm not convinced
that rejecting it entirely is the best course.
That's not really a backdoor. You argue that Tor is vulnerable to global
adversaries, and was designed that way. But it's not just Tor. It seems
that all low-latency anonymity systems that scale to numerous users are
vulnerable to global adversaries.
I'm just saying that you don't know for sure. You may think that you do.
But there's just too much uncertainty. You said as much in another

Say what you will about Tor, a global drug marketplace is very cool :)

Because that radical conclusion would leave me nothing to work with.
Indeed, we could have the same argument about the machine that I'm
typing this message on. The CPU is a total black box. It could be pwned
as badly as Tor. Firmware could have been pwned.
So I work with what I have, being as careful as I know how.
It's possible.
I don't. But lots of other folks do. Russia could still destroy the US,

I tested 29 Windows VPN clients for DNS, IPv4 and IPv6 Leaks. Six
(AirVPN, FrootVPN, IVPN, Mullvad, Perfect Privacy and SlickVPN)
performed perfectly. Three others (CyberGhost, oVPN.to and
SecureVPN.to) hit VPN-specified nameservers directly while
reconnecting after uplink interruption. But that's not a huge issue,
in that they didn't hit other nameservers. The other 20 Windows VPN
clients failed in various ways. Over half leaked IPv6 packets whenever
the machine was connected to the Internet. After uplink interruption,
some failed to reconnect automatically, and some leaked IPv4 packets.

Thanks. I've been thinking about how to test harder. I did ICMP ping

I'll take a closer look at the clients. In many cases, it was just
stock OpenVPN, or maybe with a wrapper.
Good point. I'll tweak that language.
Yes, it's why doing your own leak prevention is best. Unless the VPN
provides its own IPv6 address, disable IPv6 everywhere you can, and
block it with firewall rules. Use firewall rules to allow connections
on physical interface only to VPN server. Restrict everything else to
VPN tunnel. And make sure that you're using VPN-assigned DNS server(s)
through VPN tunnel.
But the six totally leak-free Windows VPN clients do that. Indeed,
FrootVPN and Perfect Privacy provide their own IPv6 addresses. And
FrootVPN is leak-free using stock OpenVPN, doing just server-side.
Interesting. VPN SOCKS5 port.

Yes, VPNs will provide as much privacy as Tor does for purely local
adversaries. But if your adversary can get logs from the VPN server, or
the hosting provider, you're screwed. With Tor, such adversaries would
need to get logs from at least two of the three relays in circuits. And
circuits change frequently, so that means lots of relays.
And sure, you can nest VPNs. So a nested chain of three VPNs arguably
does as much as a Tor circuit. But it's static. Or at least, I haven't
figured out how to automate switching. And there's also the matter of
paying for a bunch of VPNs.
Anyway, I hedge my bets by accessing Tor through nested VPNs.
Right. I2P also runs on Java.
Well, that's cool, if it works for you. Doesn't work for me, however.
You have a point. But far too many people do seem to believe that

One can also use VPS running SSH onion services for old-school host
chaining. Each VPS connects through a VPN, so Tor can't detect that

True. But ISPs normally aren't a treat. It's who's pushing their

Yes. But there are many mid-size adversaries. And you could also say
that Tor works against all but the global adversaries. Plus clever ones
that can exploit bugs.
True. But not me.
I have no clue what percentage of Tor code has been funded by the US
government. There are lots of volunteers, after all.
But I agree that Tor has rather dominated the space for "anonymity
systems". Every few years, I see a paper about something new, but they
never seem to go anywhere. So yes, there is a problem. But I don't think
that state subsidy is directly at fault.
Interesting. But I still don't like I2P, because decent performance
depends on being a relay, with a public IP address and open port. One
can do it with VPNs and port forwarding. But still.
I get that. And I suspect that you're in a friendlier environment.
Many Tor users have been screwed by thinking that they were "anonymous".
But still, many more would have been screwed if they had done whatever
they were doing without any protection. Maybe some of them, such as the
ones pwned by CMU, would have been better off using VPNs. That's rather
ironic, considering how much abuse Tor supporters have heaped on VPNs.

Consider this thought experiment. Let's say that some cypherpunk, with
unimpeachable anarchist credentials, creates an anonymity system. One
that's not vulnerable to local adversaries or global adversaries. One,
perhaps, that uses covert channels, so ISPs can't even detect that it's
being used. Then they release the source, and fun begins.
So who would use it? I'm guessing that everyone who uses Tor, I2P, etc,
etc would use it. And so we'd be back to where we are now with Tor, with
just the exception that the new system isn't vulnerable to global
How would you keep statist criminals from using it?
There's still the criticism that Tor is intentionally vulnerable to
global adversaries. Maybe it was at first, by design. But it's an
open-source project. You'd need to argue that contributions which
increased resistance to global adversaries have been rejected or
discouraged. Is there evidence for that?
By providing freedom and privacy for state subjects.
Also, see the above thought experiment. It doesn't matter whose project
it is. The same people would end up using it.
Always :) Mostly caffeine, though. Modafinil too :)
It's not a zero-sum game.
As much as I sympathize for victims of criminal states, I believe that
anonymity systems are essential for protecting privacy and freedom. I
also believe that they may eventually reduce state power substantially.
Although that's seeming more and more like a dream.
Maybe not, but pedophiles are the goto example. Government criminals
fuck people at much larger scales, for sure. Maybe the crypter assholes
are a better example, but that's still small-scale.

Yes, far more papers than implementations. Once you have something that
works well enough, or that people are at least so convinced, new ideas
don't attract much interest. But maybe that's changing now.
Why did Tor go with circuit switching? Was it mostly about efficiency?
We have a very different Internet now. Also, is it easier to bury packet
switching in chaff?
Which ones, in particular?
With global active adversaries, which can observe and modify packets on
every public network, it's hard to imagine how substantive [anonymity |
unlinkability | deniability | privacy] is possible. Sure, every node
might send traffic that's not provably nonrandom to every other node at
constant rate. But it's still obvious that you're up to something. And
once they tweak your traffic, they can look at what other nodes start
behaving differently. So I come back to the need for covert channels.
Maybe so. But many of them tend to keep to themselves ;)

Yes, far more papers than implementations. Once you have something that

Why did Tor go with circuit switching? Was it mostly about efficiency?
We have a very different Internet now. Also, is it easier to bury packet
switching in chaff?
Which ones, in particular?
With global active adversaries, which can observe and modify packets on
every public network, it's hard to imagine how substantive [anonymity |
unlinkability | deniability | privacy] is possible. Sure, every node
might send traffic that's not provably nonrandom to every other node at

I tested 29 Windows VPN clients for DNS, IPv4 and IPv6 Leaks. Six
(AirVPN, FrootVPN, IVPN, Mullvad, Perfect Privacy and SlickVPN)
performed perfectly. Three others (CyberGhost, oVPN.to and
SecureVPN.to) hit VPN-specified nameservers directly while
reconnecting after uplink interruption. But that's not a huge issue,
in that they didn't hit other nameservers. The other 20 Windows VPN
clients failed in various ways. Over half leaked IPv6 packets whenever
the machine was connected to the Internet. After uplink interruption,
some failed to reconnect automatically, and some leaked IPv4 packets.

Thanks. I've been thinking about how to test harder. I did ICMP ping

I'll take a closer look at the clients. In many cases, it was just
stock OpenVPN, or maybe with a wrapper.
Good point. I'll tweak that language.
Yes, it's why doing your own leak prevention is best. Unless the VPN
provides its own IPv6 address, disable IPv6 everywhere you can, and
block it with firewall rules. Use firewall rules to allow connections
on physical interface only to VPN server. Restrict everything else to
VPN tunnel. And make sure that you're using VPN-assigned DNS server(s)
through VPN tunnel.
But the six totally leak-free Windows VPN clients do that. Indeed,
FrootVPN and Perfect Privacy provide their own IPv6 addresses. And
FrootVPN is leak-free using stock OpenVPN, doing just server-side.
Interesting. VPN SOCKS5 port.

Yes, VPNs will provide as much privacy as Tor does for purely local
adversaries. But if your adversary can get logs from the VPN server, or
the hosting provider, you're screwed. With Tor, such adversaries would
need to get logs from at least two of the three relays in circuits. And
circuits change frequently, so that means lots of relays.
And sure, you can nest VPNs. So a nested chain of three VPNs arguably
does as much as a Tor circuit. But it's static. Or at least, I haven't
figured out how to automate switching. And there's also the matter of
paying for a bunch of VPNs.
Anyway, I hedge my bets by accessing Tor through nested VPNs.
Right. I2P also runs on Java.
Well, that's cool, if it works for you. Doesn't work for me, however.
You have a point. But far too many people do seem to believe that
they're anonymous on the Internet.

At a minimum, I recommend hitting Tor through at least one VPN. Or
better, nested chains of at least three VPNs. To prevent leaks, I
recommend using pfSense VMs as VPN gateways, and Whonix VMs for Tor.
One can also use VPS running SSH onion services for old-school host
chaining. Each VPS connects through a VPN, so Tor can't detect that
you're chaining circuits. See

Yes, it's not so easy. And even with help from their national
government, it would take a while. And even VPNs that log can't retain
logs forever, so you might get lucky.
True. But ISPs normally aren't a treat. It's who's pushing their
buttons. Whether it's the MPAA or Los Zetas.
Yes. But there are many mid-size adversaries. And you could also say
that Tor works against all but the global adversaries. Plus clever ones
that can exploit bugs.
True. But not me.
I have no clue what percentage of Tor code has been funded by the US
government. There are lots of volunteers, after all.
But I agree that Tor has rather dominated the space for "anonymity
systems". Every few years, I see a paper about something new, but they
never seem to go anywhere. So yes, there is a problem. But I don't think
that state subsidy is directly at fault.
Interesting. But I still don't like I2P, because decent performance
depends on being a relay, with a public IP address and open port. One
can do it with VPNs and port forwarding. But still.
I get that. And I suspect that you're in a friendlier environment.
Many Tor users have been screwed by thinking that they were "anonymous".
But still, many more would have been screwed if they had done whatever
they were doing without any protection. Maybe some of them, such as the
ones pwned by CMU, would have been better off using VPNs. That's rather
ironic, considering how much abuse Tor supporters have heaped on VPNs.
But overall, I think that Tor has done much good.

For sure. But also for online drug dealers. There have been a few
spectacular failures, certainly. And the security model of having
illegal stuff mailed to meatspace addresses is laughable. But it has
clearly increased availability, especially for niche substances like DMT
and analogues. Quality too, I suspect.
For me, that's a good. No question.
More generally, Tor has allowed many to evade state control. Some of
them deserve to die, in my opinion. But the important point is that Tor
has overall reduced state power.
Is that not a good thing, juan?
It's true that Tor has allowed the CIA to act more freely in Ukraine,
Syria, Iran, etc. But that, like freedom for pedophiles, is just a cost
of usable "anonymity systems" (or whatever you want to call them).

Well, I do get the sense that it's been mostly low-level people, working
in the streets, who have been killed.[0] But Duterte's list apparently
includes "government, military and police officials".[1] And the article
doesn't even suggest the possibility that they're just his political
opponents. And a Mirror article does claim that innocent people are
being killed.[2] So it's probably not a good model approach.

It's prudent to assume (at least) that adversaries see all of your
clearnet traffic, and are hacking at all accessible IP addresses.
So you encrypt and hide as needed. If that's illegal where you are,
you either get laws changed, take the chance of not getting caught, or
move. Risk of extradition is a problem, I admit. But it's probably not
a huge risk, unless you attract too much attention ;)

The "high" setting of Tor Browser's security slider disables both of

So hey, IPFS works with a Tor/OnionCat-linked proxy even better than
Freenet does :) Or LizardFS. Because IPFS is a bloody swarm, and it
seems fine with latency. Also, as with Freenet, it seems possible to
extend the IPFS swarm into OnionCat IPv6 address space. So one could add
stuff to IPFS from several onions, access it via IPFS gateways (clearnet
and onion) and tolerate considerable loss of source onions.
And speed is impressive! My Freenet/OnionCat guide at erehwon.dev.null
 loads rather
slowly, given high latency with multiple proxy layers. But after adding
from my node to IPFS, it loads quickly via the official IPFS gateway:
. It also loads quickly via a volunteer public
onion gateway: .
The downside is that, by default, nodes route for the entire IPFS swarm.
That currently means ~2 GB per day. But that can be decreased
substantially by running in dhtclient mode. OnionCat-only nodes would be
probably be OK with that, and only clearnet/OnionCat gateways would need
full routing. Alternatively, one could have an isolated IPFS swarm in
OnionCat IPv6 address space, with much less throughput.

@_subject: IPFS via Tor 
So hey, IPFS works with a Tor/OnionCat-linked proxy even better than
Freenet does :) Or LizardFS. Because IPFS is a bloody swarm, and it
seems fine with latency. Also, as with Freenet, it seems possible to
extend the IPFS swarm into OnionCat IPv6 address space. So one could add
stuff to IPFS from several onions, access it via IPFS gateways (clearnet
and onion) and tolerate considerable loss of source onions.
And speed is impressive! My Freenet/OnionCat guide at erehwon.dev.null
 loads rather
slowly, given high latency with multiple proxy layers. But after adding
from my node to IPFS, it loads quickly via the official IPFS gateway:
. It also loads quickly via a volunteer public
onion gateway: .
The downside is that, by default, nodes route for the entire IPFS swarm.
That currently means ~2 GB per day. But that can be decreased
substantially by running in dhtclient mode. OnionCat-only nodes would be
probably be OK with that, and only clearnet/OnionCat gateways would need
full routing. Alternatively, one could have an isolated IPFS swarm in
OnionCat IPv6 address space, with much less throughput.

most part, they mind their own business. So they're not problematic. We

So then you have myriad tweaks ("*anarchy etc) to deal with that. But
none have worked out very well, I think.
You comply strategically, and conceal non-compliance (say, using crypto)
as needed to accomplish your goals. I'd say that it's more like statist
propaganda to argue that you ought to openly defy state power. Because
then you can be eliminated.

@_subject: Playing with overlay networks 
So let's say that a bunch of us have Tor onion servers. They're linked
to each other via OnionCat with ip4ip6 tunnels. With IPv4 routing so
each can hit the others. And with iptables rules (IPv4 and IPv6) to drop
packets to/from everyone else running OnionCat. Maybe even
HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient/HidServAuth to lock down access.
What might we do with that? We might create an overlay Internet, I
suppose. Given how long OnionCat has been around, there are probably a
few of those. I doubt that OnionScan[0,1] would see the connections,
given that there are no hyperlinks, and better, no unauthorized access.
But more specifically, what? BitTorrent, for sure ;) LizardFS works, so
we could have private and shared cloud storage, backed by globally
redundant, erasure-coded storage.
What about VPN services? Say, with two VPS linked via OnionCat. You hit
VPN server as an onion service, and exit through one of many redundant
VPS. We already have . So maybe chain that with VPNs
via onion services. What do y'all think?
And what about Freenet or I2P on an OnionCat network? Or one of the P2P
messaging apps? Or even old-school Mixmaster?
Back to basics, would any of that help against global adversaries? It's
very hard to evade observation of network edges. You can have lots of
chaff, but then that itself can be a signature.

Don't get me wrong. I hate CloudFlare. It's fucking stupid to break
HTTPS security as MitM in order to protect clueless against DDoS. Clever
adversaries can takeover sites if their interaction with CloudFlare
isn't adequately secured. And I hate having to deal with their fucking
CAPTCHAs when I'm using Tor.
But as much as I hate US military, I don't delude myself that they're
the only assholes out there. Maybe the most resourceful assholes. And
the most arrogant assholes. But far from the only ones. It's the fucking

Using Sigaint for email has nothing to do with CloudFlare. You can't
even hit Sigaint webmail, except as a Tor onion service. CloudFlare
doesn't proxy mailserver connections. It's just their fucking website.

It's my impression that Sigaint is pretty neutral about moral and
ethical issues. Yes, they provide protection against "dragnet
surveillance". But the fact that CloudFlare is insecure, and may be an
NSA honeypot, is no reason for them to avoid using it for posting a
warning on their gateway IP. That warning is just for clueless mail
admins and LEA. Their website is .

Dude, you're just bullshitting. There are no exit nodes in onion service
connections. There are two Tor circuits, one specified and built by the
user, and the other specified and built by the onion service, and they
meet at the rendezvous point. Who do you think is influencing that, and
how? Are you accusing Sigaint of being compromised, or just ragging on
them because they use CloulFlare?
In order for Sigaint to exchange messages with clearnet mailservers,
they must have gateways. And those gateways are obviously points of
attack. But I pretty fucking sure that Sigaint uses transport security
with clearnet mailservers. And everything ought to be GnuPG encrypted,
so I don't particularly care how mail from Sigaint gets routed out in
clearnet. Important stuff should never leave onionland, anyway :)
It doesn't matter much.

It is strange that they're using CloudFlare for their "Sigaint ain't
here, it's at  page. I strongly suspect
that they did that because 1) if the page wasn't protected against DDoS,
it wouldn't be reachable, and 2) it would have cost a lot more to host,
and 3) they didn't want to setup their own anti-DDoS protection, which
would have cost a fuckload more.
Yes! Just about the only coherent response to this subthread!
Maybe they are spending too much of their (likely considerable) onion
web portal ad income on weed, whiskey, blow and hoes :)
But just look at headers for messages from . It goes
from sigaintevyh2rzvw.onion [127.0.0.1] to mx2.sigaint.org
[62.113.238.120] using TLSv1.2 with cipher ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
(256/256 bits). Then it hits mail.pglaf.org [65.50.255.19].
And mx2.sigaint.org isn't hosted by CloudFlare, but rather by QHoster,
in Germany. Qhoster does have their website behind CloudFlare, I admit.
But I suspect that it's a challenge for Sigaint to host it's clearnet
gateway, and so they take what they can get.
So anyway, I'm not greatly worried. As I said, Sigaint is most secure
within onionland. And they peer with several other mailservers there.
But they're one of the few with a reliable clearnet gateway, which is
useful when you need it.

You comply strategically, and conceal non-compliance (say, using crypto)
as needed to accomplish your goals. I'd say that it's more like statist

then you can be eliminated.

So let's say that a bunch of us have Tor onion servers. They're linked
to each other via OnionCat with ip4ip6 tunnels. With IPv4 routing so
each can hit the others. And with iptables rules (IPv4 and IPv6) to drop
packets to/from everyone else running OnionCat. Maybe even
HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient/HidServAuth to lock down access.
What might we do with that? We might create an overlay Internet, I
suppose. Given how long OnionCat has been around, there are probably a
few of those. I doubt that OnionScan[0,1] would see the connections,
given that there are no hyperlinks, and better, no unauthorized access.
But more specifically, what? BitTorrent, for sure ;) LizardFS works, so
we could have private and shared cloud storage, backed by globally
redundant, erasure-coded storage.
What about VPN services? Say, with two VPS linked via OnionCat. You hit
VPN server as an onion service, and exit through one of many redundant
VPS. We already have . So maybe chain that with VPNs
via onion services. What do y'all think?
And what about Freenet or I2P on an OnionCat network? Or one of the P2P
messaging apps? Or even old-school Mixmaster?
Back to basics, would any of that help against global adversaries? It's
very hard to evade observation of network edges. You can have lots of

Anyway, Facebook is not our friend. They're just monetizing love. And

So what would a cypherpunk do? Maybe figure out how to fuck with

The difference between CloudFlare and Linode is that CloudFlare is a

more than Linode does. Digital Ocean is probably just as vulnerable as
Linode, but for some reason hasn't attracted as much attention.

It's my impression that Sigaint is pretty neutral about moral and
ethical issues. Yes, they provide protection against "dragnet
surveillance". But the fact that CloudFlare is insecure, and may be an
NSA honeypot, is no reason for them to avoid using it for posting a
warning on their gateway IP. That warning is just for clueless mail

Dude, you're just bullshitting. There are no exit nodes in onion service
connections. There are two Tor circuits, one specified and built by the
user, and the other specified and built by the onion service, and they
meet at the rendezvous point. Who do you think is influencing that, and
how? Are you accusing Sigaint of being compromised, or just ragging on
them because they use CloulFlare?
In order for Sigaint to exchange messages with clearnet mailservers,
they must have gateways. And those gateways are obviously points of
attack. But I pretty fucking sure that Sigaint uses transport security
with clearnet mailservers. And everything ought to be GnuPG encrypted,
so I don't particularly care how mail from Sigaint gets routed out in
clearnet. Important stuff should never leave onionland, anyway :)

It is strange that they're using CloudFlare for their "Sigaint ain't
here, it's at  page. I strongly suspect
that they did that because 1) if the page wasn't protected against DDoS,
it wouldn't be reachable, and 2) it would have cost a lot more to host,
and 3) they didn't want to setup their own anti-DDoS protection, which
would have cost a fuckload more.
Yes! Just about the only coherent response to this subthread!
Maybe they are spending too much of their (likely considerable) onion
web portal ad income on weed, whiskey, blow and hoes :)
But just look at headers for messages from . It goes
from sigaintevyh2rzvw.onion [127.0.0.1] to mx2.sigaint.org
[62.113.238.120] using TLSv1.2 with cipher ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
(256/256 bits). Then it hits mail.pglaf.org [65.50.255.19].
And mx2.sigaint.org isn't hosted by CloudFlare, but rather by QHoster,
in Germany. Qhoster does have their website behind CloudFlare, I admit.
But I suspect that it's a challenge for Sigaint to host it's clearnet
gateway, and so they take what they can get.
So anyway, I'm not greatly worried. As I said, Sigaint is most secure
within onionland. And they peer with several other mailservers there.
But they're one of the few with a reliable clearnet gateway, which is
useful when you need it.

that people _announced stuff_ on the cypherpunks list. The first VPN
service, Anonymizer, was announced on cypherpunks. So were Freenet and
Tor, as I recall. And _cypherpunks_ remailers. But that's just how

Here's what happened:
1) Someone posted in /r/privacy, with concerns about ISP monitoring.
2) I recommended using a VPN.
3) A bot flagged my post, because writing "VPN" is forbidden there.
4) I complained on /r/VPNs, pointing out that this is absurd.
5) A moderator criticized me, saying that I shill for IVPN.
6) I replied to the criticism, disputing the accusation.
7) They banned me from /r/VPNs.
So I left reddit, because /r/VPNs and /r/privacy are two main reasons
for being there. It's sad, but so it goes.

Data is neutral. And you can't have a meaningful discussion without it.
Re agendas, just about everyone has them. But the ones that we agree
with tend to be less obvious. To the extent that we agree, anyway.
So about racism, for example. Some argue that various measurables are
distributed differently in various races. Now of course, "race" is a
nebulous term. More accurately, one would say population groups.
Allegations about such differences have clearly been exploited horribly.
By slavers. By Nazis. By eugenicists in various cultures.
However, recognition of increased incidence of serious recessive
mutations among the Ashkenazim has been very helpful medically.
Likewise, the increased incidence of hypertension among
African-Americans. Indeed, it may well turn out that medical practice in
general ought to be optimized by gender and genetics.
Even solid data on differences in measurables that have been exploited
by racists could arguably play beneficial roles. For example, in the
design of educational curricula.
Anyway, advocating for ignoring some classes of data is dishonest, and
ultimately counterproductive. In my opinion, as a scientist.

If voting is involved, it's not consensus-based. There is checking for
consensus, as g2s noted. And there is blocking. So one person can block
consensus. However, there is social pressure to have persuasive
arguments supporting blocks. Blocking for personal reasons will make you
very unpopular. There's also the option to stand aside. It's somewhat
like abstaining from a vote, when you have a conflict of interest. But

If voting is involved, it's not consensus-based. There is checking for
consensus, as g2s noted. And there is blocking. So one person can block
consensus. However, there is social pressure to have persuasive
arguments supporting blocks. Blocking for personal reasons will make you
very unpopular. There's also the option to stand aside. It's somewhat
like abstaining from a vote, when you have a conflict of interest. But
you can also stand aside when you don't entirely agree, but don't want
to stand in the way of progress.

The current services will still function for a while before we actually
the support from tor. And that "while" will be few years at least. Both
versions will live in parallel so you'll be able to have current service and
next-gen service on the same tor instance.
Currently, we do not plan to have an automatic transition to a next-gen
address so if you want to create a next-gen address for your service, you'll
have to simply configure a second service in the torrc indicating that you
want the new version. We'll be documenting that process upon release.
Good question. Onion services need basically three different type of relays,
HSDir (directory), Intro point (IP) and Rendezvous Point (RP).
The tor 0.3.0 release has the next-gen support for HSDir and IP. For the RP,
the all current relays will work with next-gen. And for IP, next-gen
have a legacy option to use old IPs (<= 0.2.9). It has been put there
for this
transition period where we expect to have unfortunately a lot more tor out
there that don't support next-gen.
What is left is the HSDir that will have to be selected based on the
version advertised by the relay. So at first, there might be very few of
so there will be a period of time before we reached what we call "network
maturity" which will allow us to switch from the current service protocol to
the next-gen for all newly created services.

@_subject: Fwd: RE: SHA1 collision found 
-------- Forwarded Message --------
(I originally sent this off-list by mistake.  Peter was kind enough to
respond off-list and to suggest we take it back on-list.  This email is
a distillation of three different emails: my original, Peter's response,
and a response to Peter.)
To which I said, "Create two keys with the same fingerprint.  Sign a
contract with one, then renege on the deal.  When you get called into
court, say "I never signed that, Your Honor!" and present the second
key.  This collision pretty much shatters the nonrepudiability of SHA-1
To which Peter quite reasonably answered that the other person has a
copy of the public key which was used to sign the document originally.
Why should the fraudster's denial be believed?
The answer is that to enforce a contract (at least here in the United
States) you must be able to prove, based on a preponderance of the
evidence, that the other person entered into a contract with you.  So
imagine this conversation:
PLAINTIFF: "Your Honor, the defendant reneged on a $10,000 contract.
Make him pay up."
DEFENDANT: "I never signed anything, Your Honor."
PLAINTIFF: "I have his key, it's right here."
DEFENDANT: "That's not my key.  This is my key."
PLAINTIFF: "Of course that's what he claims!  They have the same SHA-1
fingerprint!  He did that in order to deny his signature!"
JUDGE: "So these keys are uniquely identified by the fingerprint?"
(both parties agree)
JUDGE: "And you have two keys that are identified by the same fingerprint?"
(both parties agree)
JUDGE: "And there's no way to tell which key is real?"
(both parties agree)
JUDGE: "Then we're stuck.  There's no reason to prefer one key over
another.  Plaintiff, you have failed your burden of proof in
establishing the defendant signed the contract."
Now, you could establish proof some other way: let's say you made a
videotape of the defendant signing the document.  If you could introduce
other supporting evidence (which might include other signatures on keys)
you might be able to convince the judge the signature is enforceable.
But there's nothing intrinsic to the signature itself which could
convince the judge.
So Peter is completely right to say "but there's no reason to believe
one person over the other."  Completely, absolutely right.  But the
person asking the court to enforce a contract must present a reason to
believe them over the defendant.
I hope this clarifies my answer!
(Peter also rightly remarked that he thought nonrepudiability in OpenPGP
was kind of iffy anyway.  He and I are in complete agreement on this.
OpenPGP has always had very iffy nonrepudiability.  With this SHA-1
attack, I feel the threshold has been crossed and we need to consider it

culminated in modern non-African humans.
Now, it's plain that Neanderthals were closer to other simians than are
modern humans. Just because of the timing. But no Neanderthal genes
remain in modern African humans. But modern non-African humans,
especially northern Europeans, have lots of them. Because Neanderthal
fucking was pretty common, I guess. In addition to slaughter, of course.

It's more than that. It's not even clear that there are distinct races.
While there are still a few isolated populations, most are intermixed.
But let's say, for the sake of argument, that there are races.
Testing reveals all sorts of differences among populations, and some of
those persist after aggregation by race. However, it's nontrivial to
distinguish mental differences from cultural differences. And even if
you manage that, differences are generally minor, small shifts in mean
values, and small differences in distribution widths and/or asymmetry.
But arguably, none of that is racist. What's racist is judging someone,
based on race. It's unreliable. First, because reliably determining
someone's race is nontrivial. And second, because differences between
races are small, and distributions are broad.
Well, she's judging people based on their stated opinions. Not on their
race. Many of the racist assholes under discussion are white. But we
could just as easily be discussing other sorts of racist assholes.
Well, he's plainly a racist. Or posing as one, to upset some of us.

at ~50 Mbps. With multiple targets, source servers can push ~200 Mbps.
It's obviously not very anonymous. But it's probably more anonymous than
using VPN services. That's for servers with gigabit uplinks, by the way.

I used tor-instance-create to get a separate Tor instance for each
OnionCat instance. And I specified a distinct bind port and SocksPort
for each OnionCat instance.
This setup multipaths individual tcp6 streams. And I believe that
onionbalance spreads incoming tcp connections across multiple servers.
Yes, that is a shame. I'm no coder, unfortunately. But I have been
considering the idea of crowdfunding a replacement for OnionCat. I
wonder what it would take to motivate someone.
Not an iPhone user, so ???
Maybe so. But do check out MPTCP.
~50 Gbps :)
Yes, for sure. I should emphasize that more. And what's cool about this
approach is that entry guards and middle relays are easy to host.
There's also potential to increase usability of slow relays, through
aggregation. Perhaps ten 500 kbps circuits together would give users 2-3
Mbps overall.

Dude, maybe get a fucking clue about quoting properly?
Now this is really amusing. So basically, way back in the day, there
were two main waves of migration out of Africa. One culminated in the
Neanderthals and related groups on other continents. The other
culminated in modern non-African humans.
Now, it's plain that Neanderthals were closer to other simians than are
modern humans. Just because of the timing. But no Neanderthal genes
remain in modern African humans. But modern non-African humans,
especially northern Europeans, have lots of them. Because Neanderthal
fucking was pretty common, I guess. In addition to slaughter, of course.
So anyway, some Europeans are arguably more ape-like than Africans ;)
Darwin obviously didn't know much about human evolution. Nobody did, at
the time, of course.

Yes, there's that.
But also, he was also probably a racist. Given the cultural context, I
mean. And in any case, he truly did know next to nothing about human
evolution. Nobody did, then. So he was just bullshitting. Maybe trying
to ingratiate himself to the religiously racist establishment.
Anyway, quoting him selectively about human evolution makes about as
much sense as quoting him about plate tectonics. He was a geologist,
after all. Or quoting Ludwig Boltzmann about design of gas turbines.

It's more than that. It's not even clear that there are distinct races.
While there are still a few isolated populations, most are intermixed.
But let's say, for the sake of argument, that there are races.
Testing reveals all sorts of differences among populations, and some of
those persist after aggregation by race. However, it's nontrivial to
distinguish mental differences from cultural differences. And even if
you manage that, differences are generally minor, small shifts in mean
values, and small differences in distribution widths and/or asymmetry.
But arguably, none of that is racist. What's racist is judging someone,
based on race. It's unreliable. First, because reliably determining
someone's race is nontrivial. And second, because differences between
races are small, and distributions are broad.
Well, she's judging people based on their stated opinions. Not on their
race. Many of the racist assholes under discussion are white. But we
could just as easily be discussing other sorts of racist assholes.
Well, he's plainly a racist. Or posing as one, to upset some of us.

That's what I've read. Microsoft provided patches in March for nominally
unsupported Windows versions with custom support contracts. The NHS, for
example, had dropped its XP support contract in ~2014. Cheap bastards ;)
I note that Microsoft provided these patches in May for all users.
Certainly for authentic installs without support contracts. And perhaps
even for pirated/cracked installs. I have an old cracked XP installer, I

retest at higher dosages. A reasonable set of dosages might be 1%, 2%,

So have y'all heard any more about the cat fight between PIA-cofounder
rasengan and ProtonVPN? The protonmail account on HN basically claimed
that PIA cooperates with the Chinese government.[0] And that this
accounts for the fact that the GFW wasn't blocking PIA as thoroughly as
other VPN services.
And that presumably triggered rasengan's attack on ProtonVPN and
NordVPN.[0,1] He's criticized both for failing to disclose connections
to Tesonet. And he's characterized Tesonet as a data-mining service,
riffing on their competitive-intelligence pitch.
Tesonet is apparently an enterprise VPN service, in Vilnius, which
focuses on B2B competitive intelligence. So maybe the allegations
regarding ProtonVPN and NordVPN are misleading. I mean, Tesonet is
serving data miners, but is arguably not data-mining its own customers.
And any VPN service could data-mine its customers ;)
But it is quite the cat fight :)
And really, it'd be amusing if PIA actually were China-centric. That'd
arguably make them _more_ secure for those concerned about the NSA.

Yep. I mean, that's the fucking point!
But I gotta say, they need to work on the anonymity aspect. The argument
that participation anonymity doesn't matter, as long as adversaries

=?UTF-8?Q?echnology_Review_Article?=
That's what Freenet folks recommend, and I get the argument. However, I
can't imagine how having predominantly darknet peers is safe. Because
all it takes is one malicious peer, logging all traffic and searching
for fingerprints of interest. And yes, I understand the arguments about
indeterminate forwarding.
The problem is, if you don't adequately obscure your IP address, you can
end up in court, charged with pedophilia. Which Freenet is full of. And
you'll have prosecution experts testifying that they know that you were
sharing illegal images and video. Even though they haven't cracked your
FDE. And even though their technical basis is bullshit.
And you will be screwed. Unless you have experts who can pick their shit
apart. And unless the judge and jury understand enough to be persuaded,
which is unlikely. Also, you may end up jailed indeterminately, if you
refuse to provide FDE passphrases.
Maybe total darknet can be safe. But it could also be bloody boring.
Unless some peers can periodically clone content from opennet. Via some
mix of VPNs and Tor, perhaps. But even so, you'll be screwed if you let
a malicious peer join your darknet. So it's iffy.
If anyone's interested, I can probably find notes on a project to hide
Freenet use with Tor/OnionCat. The Freenet node was a VPS, exposing user
URLs as onion services. And connecting with darknet peers via OnionCat.
Another node, on an unassociated VPS, linked with darknet peers via
OnionCat, and with opennet peers via its public IP address.
And sure, VPS security sucks. And the opennet peer was readily findable.
But finding the darknet peers, and my local VM, would have been rather
nontrivial. And in any case, it was all unattributable and throwaway.

He's relatively new to PIA, since 2016. And I'm not sure what "head of
privacy" means. I doubt that he has a very technical role.
I'm overall somewhat ambivalent about PIA. A US court subpoenaed logs,
and they said "we have no logs". And that was apparently the end of it.
But that could of course have been just a dumbshow. They do support lots
of privacy-friendly stuff, though.
But bottom line, you can't assume that any VPN is honest and not
compromised. That's just how it is. And so you must deal with it.

@_subject: AP deconstructed: Why it has not happened yet, and will not 
Thanks for that. Overall, it's a great analysis, and I mostly agree.
Yes, I totally agree. There is no "absolute anonymity".
That's a good point about bettors needing good enough anonymity to avoid
arrest. Even so, evidence from .onion marketplaces and child porn forums
suggests that Tor is good enough for users. Where users have been
busted, it's generally followed .onion compromise, with adversaries
dropping phone-home malware. And even then, it was mainly Windows users
who got nailed. Whonix users, on the other hand, would have been safe.
Especially if they hit Tor through nested VPN chains.
Busts of some .onion sites and users have involved Tor compromise. Most
notably, exploitation of the relay-early bug by CMU researchers, who
shared their data with the FBI. And once the .onion sites were pwned,
more users got nailed. For example, Playpen.
So anyway, I'm not convinced that it's hopeless for bettors. But privacy
advocates would need to better spread the word about good OPSEC.
Adequate anonymity for assassins is a much harder problem. However,
evidence from .onion marketplaces and child porn forums also suggests
that Tor would be good enough. If coupled with good OPSEC. At least,
based on public evidence, it seems that virtually all busts involved
serious OPSEC fails. But of course it's possible that public evidence is
all parallel construction bullshit. And that the NSA nailed them all.
There's also the issue that assassins aren't necessarily skilled at
network OPSEC. And vice versa. I mean, I'm for sure no assassin :) So
there would certainly be fails. But even so, survival of assassins is
arguably not a prerequisite for workable AP, as long as there's an
adequate pool. And especially if assassins don't expect to survive.
Yeah, this has always concerned me. And I don't see a solution.
Right, there could be lots of AP lotteries. And so no way to control
targeting of whatever class of individuals, and of one lottery by
others. Even so, the wealthy _already_ live in anarchy. In that the
rules don't apply to them. States are just their tools. So what AP could
do is level the playing field a little.
Maybe so. But time will tell, I suppose. If I were part of proto AP in
Augur, I'd be getting very nervous ;)

Well, as I'm sure you know, high-latency mix networks -- Cypherpunk and
Mixmaster remailers.[0] -- predate Tor. That's how I used the original
cypherpunks list, way back when. A few years ago, I played with them a
little. I got QuickSilver Lite running in Wine.[1] Basically, all email
goes to alt.anonymous.messages, you download everything, and then your
client finds stuff that you can decrypt. Some resources were (are?)
available as .onion services. I probably have notes somewhere, if you're
I'm not sure why that all died. It _was_ bloody complicated, even with
QuickSilver Lite. Also very slow. And I can't imagine how it could have
scaled. Although I suppose that some of the binary newsgroups did get
pretty fucking huge. But anyway, overhead is a key problem with mix
Development of the Web was part of it, I'm sure. Although I recall
seeing a crude hack that pulled stuff from alt.anonymous.messages, and
massaged it into a web page.
Well, if you exclude low-latency networks, you're pretty much left with
nothing to use. But even so, people who want anonymity, some of them
doing illegal stuff, _will_ end up using Tor. So why not help them use
it more safely?

I suppose. But to me it just seems that users voted with their activity.
Sure, high-latency remailer mix networks are arguably more secure
against traffic analysis. But they're not very useful for anything
except email and Usenet posting. They're not even workable for reading
Usenet anonymously.
So basically, Tor came along as the Web took over. So more and more
people started running Tor relays, and fewer and fewer ran remailers, or
even used them.
Anyway, I vaguely recall proposed higher-latency mix networks that would
be usable for browsing, remote management, etc. But I haven't heard that
any are actually getting implemented.
What have I missed?
Yes, basically. Tor was developed by the US military. But that's not
likely why privacy activists embraced it. It became popular because it
provided a better mix of security and usability.
What's a problem is _too much_ overhead. That is, total traffic grows
more or less exponentially with the number of users.
Open-source software is hardly driven by "assholes at the top".
Trust me, dude. Stay away from Freenet. Sure, you think Tor is pwned.
But Freenet is so pwned that I'd never use it ;) Except through Tor ;)
It's a joke. As soon as an adversary joins your network, they can trace
data movement. So they can show that your node has handled pieces of
illegal files, identified by hash. And even though they can't really
prove that you accessed those files, they can say in court that they
can, and you'll be hard pressed to convince a jury otherwise.
I keep repeating that Tor is what we have now for working ~anonymously
online because it just fucking is! Sure, there's JonDoNym, but it's a
tiny network, and not many people use it. And it's not really that
friendly to anonymity, in any case. I2P is interesting, I admit, but
it's mainly a closed system. There are some clearnet exits, but the rest
of I2P doesn't like them.
So it's not that I'm saying Tor is the best, or whatever. It's literally
that there's nothing else that's widely enough used to provide any real
anonymity. Or at least, that I know of.
So again, what super anonymous overlay networks have I missed? I'm all
ears :)
Is that the best you can do?

So? Well, if they're not being implemented, they're not very useful. You
can fume all you want about some ideal that ought to exist. But that
alone doesn't really help much.
And yeah, I know that they're not being implemented because those
Americunt fascists are so damn good at propaganda. I do tend to agree
with you about that. But that's not the only reason. There's also the
latency vs usability tradeoff. Or even if it is, maybe you ought to be
promoting them?
But not Freenet! That shit is ~20 years out of date. More below.
Huh? Just what the fuck else is "'cryptoanarchy' 'stuff'" then? There
are web sites. There's email. There are various more-or-less P2P
messaging systems. There's SSH for managing servers.
I agree that email and messaging would better resist compromise if they
used higher-latency mix networks. Even very high-latency ones, with lots
of padding. But SSH via nested VPN chains plus Tor is painful enough as
it is. I can't imagine waiting minutes between typing and remote action.
Well, I was hoping for some constructive discussion. But that's hard
with you. But whatever, we are what we are.
Indeed. Tor was announced on _this list_ :)
And seriously, are you following the published literature on overlay
networks? I was, but I'm maybe 2-3 years out of date. So if any y'all
know about something that's getting traction, or seriously ought to be,
please do point to it.
Yeah, yeah. But nothing's perfect. And consider how many more would be
jailed or dead if they _hadn't_ used Tor.
No, I'm not. Go read the fucking papers, if you don't believe me.
So what? Is poverty your ideal or something?
That's where you're wrong. If an adversary is in your Freenet network,
they see all those encrypted pieces of stuff. And if they're running a
suitably modified version of the Freenet software, they know which of
those pieces are part of which files. Because they can fetch each file
of interest, and decompose the process of decryption and file assembly.
And, being part of the network, they know which pieces they get from
your node, and which pieces they send to it. That is, they know what
files you're handling.
You could say the same about Tor ;)
Dude, I don't ignore Tor's problems! Where we differ is that I'm willing
to work around them. And seriously, recommending Freenet is far^N worse
than recommending Tor.
There's a lot more on the web than commercial media and shit.

Huh? Are you retarded? Sure, you and your friends can setup some super
duper mix network, but it won't do you any fucking good. Because, you
know, you're the only people using it. And once an adversary gets
access, you're totally screwed.
Sure, "discussing the 'technical details'" helps. But not if you're just
bitching about what's wrong with existing stuff. And unless you actually
mobilize some support and participation for whatever you want. I haven't
heard much of that from you.
No mocking involved. I do agree. And you know, I really don't love those
Americunt fascists either. Even though I'm living there now.
Yes, you did. Barely. And them you hand-waved it away ;)
So far, you've promoted Freenet. Which is arguably _worse_ than Tor.
No, Freenet is 20 years out of date. Because it makes _no_ attempt to
obscure IP addresses of peers. As far as I know, there is no protocol
for decentralized storage that does obscure IP addresses of peers. And
so you need to use some overlay network. Such as VPNs and/or Tor.
Or in this case, I2P. Because there's no need to reach clearnet stuff.
However, I2P also has its issues. It's a lot smaller than Tor. And every
participant must be a router, analogous to a Tor relay. Which means that
participants attract more attention, and may get their IPs blacklisted.
For decentralized storage generally, I like IPFS. For example, a year or
two ago I put "Fast Data Transfer via Tor" on IPFS.[0] And even though
I'm not currently running any IPFS nodes, it's still there. Because
enough people pinned it. If I hadn't disclosed that, it would be
nontrivial for adversaries to link it to me.
0) Really? Gotta a link for that? I've been wondering where to get some
current music at a decent price. I will _not_ use Spotify!
OK, so how are you planning to use Augur or whatever without revealing
your IP address? And actually, if I said that Tor would work with Augur,
I was wrong. Because Ethereum wallets use UDP, which Tor doesn't handle.
So you're left with nested VPN chains. Unless someone forks to I2P. But
that too seems iffy, given how small I2P is.
Maybe. But I can't quite imagine a blockchain client via high-latency
networks. I mean, the classic Bitcoin client is barely usable via VPNs.
However, I'm no cryptocurrency expert, so maybe it'd be workable.
That's a cop out, Juan. And it's a crucial issue, because any ~anonymous
overlay network will involve managing remote servers anonymously.
You say propaganda. I say objective discussion.
Sure, that's part of it. So are you saying that you'd rather live in
China than in the US? What "repressive" regimes do you like?
Good for you, then.
Well, that's where we differ. I do stupidly risky things because what I
do is up to me. And because it's fun. Cowering in fear ain't my trip.
And DPR? He got nailed because he made too many stupid mistakes. And
some of his collaborators got nailed because one of those stupid
mistakes was keeping records, including images of their fucking
passports, on his fucking laptop. Which he stupidly carried around, and
let the feds grab while FDE was unlocked.
There is no "doesn't get promoted". Go promote it yourself.
Whatever, dude :)
I mean, one of your peers.
It was in the news a couple years ago. There's even a notice on the
Freenet website about it. Making excuses. That ex cop in Philadelphia,
who's still jailed for refusing to disclose his FDE passphrase, was one
of them.
For background on the Black Ice Project, see
You have no clue who funded Freenet, do you?
First, I _always_ use Tor via nested VPN chains. Using Whonix to
mitigate against leaks. Or between remote servers and VPS that I've
leased as anonymously as possible, via nested VPN chains and Tor, using
well-mixed Bitcoin.
Second, I _never_ share anything online, even via nested VPN chains and
Tor, that could link to my meatspace identity.
Good one :)
You're joking, right?
OK, how about  aka y5fmhyqdr6r7ddws.onion aka

Sure, there are better options. But they're not currently implemented at
useful scale. How can you use a mix network that exists only as an
academic paper, and perhaps some tens of people testing it?
OK, that helps maybe a little. But you've been online for many years,
and I'm sure that you have friends and associates. So organize some
cutting-edge mix network. Maybe Riffle, developed by Young Hyun Kwon.[1]
Or whatever you think better. And damn, I'll even help, if you like :)
Maybe to you I seem insufficiently critical. But maybe ask Tor devs ;)
Almost certainly, because it's distributed. But in my experience, the
Freenet community doesn't like people using proxies.
That's because I2P has very few clearnet exits, so all you see is stuff
hosted on I2P. One of the major Russian marketplaces is (or was) on I2P.
Also lots of porn and CP, predictably.
What's nice about Tor is that relay operators attract the most
attention. And it's my impression that they're generally not up to any
iffy shit. Or at least, they shouldn't be, if they're smart. So people
up to iffy shit just run clients. And that doesn't attract as much
attention. Especially if they use bridges that aren't published. Or
create their own bridge, on some random VPS.
So whatever. It's the thing now, for kids. But it does seem to work
pretty well.
Sure, but didn't know that it was still up. Is it?
I mean, damn, I can't find any music on TPB! That sucks.
Yeah, well, in this case you're right :(
We agree on that :)
The root issue isn't where Augur's website runs. The issue is trading
Ethereum anonymously.
That's a feature, not a bug, they say.
Yeah, but you can't do anything unless the client is synced.
Yeah, that's what I do with Bitcoin.
Yes. But whatever version of Jim's AP you're considering, I guarantee
that it will involve managing remote servers.
Damn ;)
It's in their contracts, probably ;)
I tell them that, if they want to buy and sell illegal drugs over the
net, they ought to use some mix of VPNs and Tor. Just because it's
almost certainly better than just using clearnet. But I also typically
point out that giving your real mail address to some online drug dealer
is risky. They could be a narc, or compromised. They could get busted,
with their address list. Packages could be delivered, with cops waiting
across the street.
Do you have sources that show otherwise? If not, then all you have is
some story based on your preconceptions.
Tell that to someone facing charges, and expert witnesses that a jury
believes. But whatever.
No idea, myself.
Not a VPN hop. AT least three hops, using different VPN services.
It's hard to say. My best guess is that they can intercept essentially
everything. But that it's still at least nontrivial, and perhaps not yet
feasible, to trace particular connections through multiple hops. But
really, who knows?
OK, let me see. I don't spend much time on .onion sites. Many sites did
disappear over the past year or two. A couple huge hosting operations
were taken down. Ast least some of that was CMU fallout.

OK, I'm glad. We at least agree that better anonymity networks are
needed. In particular, higher-latency mix networks with padding. And I
think that we agree that lack of demand has stalled implementation, even
though there have been proposals.
And so, I'm going to drop the rest of the discussion about this, because
I'm tired of it ;) I was serious about Riffle, though :)
Ummm, no :) There are still many extreme .onion sites. Mainly "hard
candy". A quick scan yielded eight that were up when I checked:
Child a Priori - because children always come first
Dark Scandals [pwned cam whores]
Hijab FUCK Girls
Little Cute Girls
Loli Lust
Sea Kitten Palace [gore, torture and Disney]
Teen Deepthroat
videos for Bitcoin
Youngest Girls
Even so, the collections on Freenet are far more extensive.
OK, so I have spent a few hours rooting around for .onion sites. There
are multiple forks of The Hidden Wiki, plus a hard candy fork:
The Hidden Wiki [semi censored version]
The Uncensored Hidden Wiki [but no hard candy]
Central Park [including some hard candy]
Then there are a few search engines:
Ahima [search, fast, doesn't return many dead sites]
not Evil [search, returns many dead sites, some marked as dead]
OnionLand Search Engine [heavily censored]
Also some discussion sites:
Galaxy3 [general discussion]
Hidden Answers [very diverse]
The Hub [dark marketplace stuff]
I did find a few cracking/hacking sites:
0day [hacking forum, also clearnet]
AN0NYM0US'z F0RUM [hacking forum]
Codex [cracking forum]
Torum ["cyber security" forum]
But most of the old standards are gone, such as Dark0de, Mazafaka and
Trojanforge. And "not Evil" returns numerous dead cracking/hacking
.onion URLs.
So anyway, it's my guess that most of the cracking/hacking sites, and
lots of other weird shit, were on shared .onion hosting that's been
taken down. And conversely, it's arguable that the surviving hard candy
sites are self hosted. Survival of the fittest, you know. But of course,
it's also possible (or even likely) that those hard candy sites are just
honeypots. As Playpen was, in the FBI's Operation Pacifier.
That's rather sad. But maybe now there's a strong market for secure
.onion hosting services :)

the Jews think of that. Israel will be the battleground, of course.

Maccabee Revolution, from the Seleucid perspective.
The Maccabees (Hebrews) come off basically as devil worshipers ;) They
conjure various aspects (aka angels) of Yahweh to smite their enemies.

So have y'all heard any more about the cat fight between PIA-cofounder
rasengan and ProtonVPN? The protonmail account on HN basically claimed
that PIA cooperates with the Chinese government.[0] And that this
accounts for the fact that the GFW wasn't blocking PIA as thoroughly as
other VPN services.
And that presumably triggered rasengan's attack on ProtonVPN and
NordVPN.[0,1] He's criticized both for failing to disclose connections
to Tesonet. And he's characterized Tesonet as a data-mining service,
riffing on their competitive-intelligence pitch.
Tesonet is apparently an enterprise VPN service, in Vilnius, which
focuses on B2B competitive intelligence. So maybe the allegations
regarding ProtonVPN and NordVPN are misleading. I mean, Tesonet is
serving data miners, but is arguably not data-mining its own customers.
And any VPN service could data-mine its customers ;)
But it is quite the cat fight :)
And really, it'd be amusing if PIA actually were China-centric. That'd
arguably make them _more_ secure for those concerned about the NSA.

That's what Freenet folks recommend, and I get the argument. However, I
can't imagine how having predominantly darknet peers is safe. Because
all it takes is one malicious peer, logging all traffic and searching
for fingerprints of interest. And yes, I understand the arguments about
indeterminate forwarding.
The problem is, if you don't adequately obscure your IP address, you can
end up in court, charged with pedophilia. Which Freenet is full of. And
you'll have prosecution experts testifying that they know that you were
sharing illegal images and video. Even though they haven't cracked your
FDE. And even though their technical basis is bullshit.
And you will be screwed. Unless you have experts who can pick their shit
apart. And unless the judge and jury understand enough to be persuaded,
which is unlikely. Also, you may end up jailed indeterminately, if you
refuse to provide FDE passphrases.
Maybe total darknet can be safe. But it could also be bloody boring.
Unless some peers can periodically clone content from opennet. Via some
mix of VPNs and Tor, perhaps. But even so, you'll be screwed if you let
a malicious peer join your darknet. So it's iffy.
If anyone's interested, I can probably find notes on a project to hide
Freenet use with Tor/OnionCat. The Freenet node was a VPS, exposing user
URLs as onion services. And connecting with darknet peers via OnionCat.
Another node, on an unassociated VPS, linked with darknet peers via
OnionCat, and with opennet peers via its public IP address.
And sure, VPS security sucks. And the opennet peer was readily findable.
But finding the darknet peers, and my local VM, would have been rather
nontrivial. And in any case, it was all unattributable and throwaway.

He's relatively new to PIA, since 2016. And I'm not sure what "head of

I'm overall somewhat ambivalent about PIA. A US court subpoenaed logs,
and they said "we have no logs". And that was apparently the end of it.
But that could of course have been just a dumbshow. They do support lots
of privacy-friendly stuff, though.
But bottom line, you can't assume that any VPN is honest and not

Thanks for that. Overall, it's a great analysis, and I mostly agree.
Yes, I totally agree. There is no "absolute anonymity".
That's a good point about bettors needing good enough anonymity to avoid
arrest. Even so, evidence from .onion marketplaces and child porn forums
suggests that Tor is good enough for users. Where users have been
busted, it's generally followed .onion compromise, with adversaries
dropping phone-home malware. And even then, it was mainly Windows users
who got nailed. Whonix users, on the other hand, would have been safe.
Especially if they hit Tor through nested VPN chains.
Busts of some .onion sites and users have involved Tor compromise. Most
notably, exploitation of the relay-early bug by CMU researchers, who
shared their data with the FBI. And once the .onion sites were pwned,
more users got nailed. For example, Playpen.
So anyway, I'm not convinced that it's hopeless for bettors. But privacy
advocates would need to better spread the word about good OPSEC.
Adequate anonymity for assassins is a much harder problem. However,
evidence from .onion marketplaces and child porn forums also suggests
that Tor would be good enough. If coupled with good OPSEC. At least,
based on public evidence, it seems that virtually all busts involved
serious OPSEC fails. But of course it's possible that public evidence is
all parallel construction bullshit. And that the NSA nailed them all.
There's also the issue that assassins aren't necessarily skilled at
network OPSEC. And vice versa. I mean, I'm for sure no assassin :) So
there would certainly be fails. But even so, survival of assassins is
arguably not a prerequisite for workable AP, as long as there's an
adequate pool. And especially if assassins don't expect to survive.
Yeah, this has always concerned me. And I don't see a solution.
Right, there could be lots of AP lotteries. And so no way to control
targeting of whatever class of individuals, and of one lottery by
others. Even so, the wealthy _already_ live in anarchy. In that the
rules don't apply to them. States are just their tools. So what AP could
do is level the playing field a little.
Maybe so. But time will tell, I suppose. If I were part of proto AP in
Augur, I'd be getting very nervous ;)

.onion marketplaces is not wanting to disclose my postal address. That's
what earned DPR his first visit from the feds, after all. Fake IDs.
Anyway, Tor is out of consideration. What would you have people use for
any sort of anonymity? JonDonym? I2P? Cruising public WiFi hotspots?
Or is it nothing? And if nothing, how useful is that?

Well, as I'm sure you know, high-latency mix networks -- Cypherpunk and
Mixmaster remailers.[0] -- predate Tor. That's how I used the original
cypherpunks list, way back when. A few years ago, I played with them a
little. I got QuickSilver Lite running in Wine.[1] Basically, all email
goes to alt.anonymous.messages, you download everything, and then your
client finds stuff that you can decrypt. Some resources were (are?)
available as .onion services. I probably have notes somewhere, if you're
I'm not sure why that all died. It _was_ bloody complicated, even with
QuickSilver Lite. Also very slow. And I can't imagine how it could have
scaled. Although I suppose that some of the binary newsgroups did get
pretty fucking huge. But anyway, overhead is a key problem with mix
Development of the Web was part of it, I'm sure. Although I recall
seeing a crude hack that pulled stuff from alt.anonymous.messages, and
massaged it into a web page.
Well, if you exclude low-latency networks, you're pretty much left with
nothing to use. But even so, people who want anonymity, some of them
doing illegal stuff, _will_ end up using Tor. So why not help them use
it more safely?

@_subject: the tor scam - Re: AP deconstructed: Why it has not happened yet,  
I suppose. But to me it just seems that users voted with their activity.
Sure, high-latency remailer mix networks are arguably more secure
against traffic analysis. But they're not very useful for anything
except email and Usenet posting. They're not even workable for reading
Usenet anonymously.
So basically, Tor came along as the Web took over. So more and more
people started running Tor relays, and fewer and fewer ran remailers, or
even used them.
Anyway, I vaguely recall proposed higher-latency mix networks that would
be usable for browsing, remote management, etc. But I haven't heard that
any are actually getting implemented.
What have I missed?
Yes, basically. Tor was developed by the US military. But that's not
likely why privacy activists embraced it. It became popular because it
provided a better mix of security and usability.
What's a problem is _too much_ overhead. That is, total traffic grows
more or less exponentially with the number of users.
Open-source software is hardly driven by "assholes at the top".
Trust me, dude. Stay away from Freenet. Sure, you think Tor is pwned.
But Freenet is so pwned that I'd never use it ;) Except through Tor ;)
It's a joke. As soon as an adversary joins your network, they can trace
data movement. So they can show that your node has handled pieces of
illegal files, identified by hash. And even though they can't really
prove that you accessed those files, they can say in court that they
can, and you'll be hard pressed to convince a jury otherwise.
I keep repeating that Tor is what we have now for working ~anonymously
online because it just fucking is! Sure, there's JonDoNym, but it's a
tiny network, and not many people use it. And it's not really that
friendly to anonymity, in any case. I2P is interesting, I admit, but
it's mainly a closed system. There are some clearnet exits, but the rest
of I2P doesn't like them.
So it's not that I'm saying Tor is the best, or whatever. It's literally
that there's nothing else that's widely enough used to provide any real
anonymity. Or at least, that I know of.
So again, what super anonymous overlay networks have I missed? I'm all
ears :)
Is that the best you can do?

So? Well, if they're not being implemented, they're not very useful. You
can fume all you want about some ideal that ought to exist. But that
alone doesn't really help much.
And yeah, I know that they're not being implemented because those
Americunt fascists are so damn good at propaganda. I do tend to agree
with you about that. But that's not the only reason. There's also the
latency vs usability tradeoff. Or even if it is, maybe you ought to be
promoting them?
But not Freenet! That shit is ~20 years out of date. More below.
Huh? Just what the fuck else is "'cryptoanarchy' 'stuff'" then? There
are web sites. There's email. There are various more-or-less P2P
messaging systems. There's SSH for managing servers.
I agree that email and messaging would better resist compromise if they
used higher-latency mix networks. Even very high-latency ones, with lots
of padding. But SSH via nested VPN chains plus Tor is painful enough as
it is. I can't imagine waiting minutes between typing and remote action.
Well, I was hoping for some constructive discussion. But that's hard
with you. But whatever, we are what we are.
Indeed. Tor was announced on _this list_ :)
And seriously, are you following the published literature on overlay
networks? I was, but I'm maybe 2-3 years out of date. So if any y'all
know about something that's getting traction, or seriously ought to be,
please do point to it.
Yeah, yeah. But nothing's perfect. And consider how many more would be
jailed or dead if they _hadn't_ used Tor.
No, I'm not. Go read the fucking papers, if you don't believe me.
So what? Is poverty your ideal or something?
That's where you're wrong. If an adversary is in your Freenet network,
they see all those encrypted pieces of stuff. And if they're running a
suitably modified version of the Freenet software, they know which of
those pieces are part of which files. Because they can fetch each file
of interest, and decompose the process of decryption and file assembly.
And, being part of the network, they know which pieces they get from
your node, and which pieces they send to it. That is, they know what
files you're handling.
You could say the same about Tor ;)
Dude, I don't ignore Tor's problems! Where we differ is that I'm willing
to work around them. And seriously, recommending Freenet is far^N worse
than recommending Tor.
There's a lot more on the web than commercial media and shit.
It's you who lack much of a clue here :)
Yeah, well, we know that :) But I don't care. All I care about is
pointing out the weaknesses of your arguments. As a public service.

Huh? Are you retarded? Sure, you and your friends can setup some super
duper mix network, but it won't do you any fucking good. Because, you
know, you're the only people using it. And once an adversary gets
access, you're totally screwed.
Sure, "discussing the 'technical details'" helps. But not if you're just
bitching about what's wrong with existing stuff. And unless you actually
mobilize some support and participation for whatever you want. I haven't
heard much of that from you.
No mocking involved. I do agree. And you know, I really don't love those
Americunt fascists either. Even though I'm living there now.
Yes, you did. Barely. And them you hand-waved it away ;)
So far, you've promoted Freenet. Which is arguably _worse_ than Tor.
No, Freenet is 20 years out of date. Because it makes _no_ attempt to
obscure IP addresses of peers. As far as I know, there is no protocol
for decentralized storage that does obscure IP addresses of peers. And
so you need to use some overlay network. Such as VPNs and/or Tor.
Or in this case, I2P. Because there's no need to reach clearnet stuff.
However, I2P also has its issues. It's a lot smaller than Tor. And every
participant must be a router, analogous to a Tor relay. Which means that
participants attract more attention, and may get their IPs blacklisted.
For decentralized storage generally, I like IPFS. For example, a year or
two ago I put "Fast Data Transfer via Tor" on IPFS.[0] And even though
I'm not currently running any IPFS nodes, it's still there. Because
enough people pinned it. If I hadn't disclosed that, it would be
nontrivial for adversaries to link it to me.
0) Really? Gotta a link for that? I've been wondering where to get some
current music at a decent price. I will _not_ use Spotify!
OK, so how are you planning to use Augur or whatever without revealing
your IP address? And actually, if I said that Tor would work with Augur,
I was wrong. Because Ethereum wallets use UDP, which Tor doesn't handle.
So you're left with nested VPN chains. Unless someone forks to I2P. But
that too seems iffy, given how small I2P is.
Maybe. But I can't quite imagine a blockchain client via high-latency
networks. I mean, the classic Bitcoin client is barely usable via VPNs.
However, I'm no cryptocurrency expert, so maybe it'd be workable.
That's a cop out, Juan. And it's a crucial issue, because any ~anonymous
overlay network will involve managing remote servers anonymously.
You say propaganda. I say objective discussion.
Sure, that's part of it. So are you saying that you'd rather live in
China than in the US? What "repressive" regimes do you like?
Good for you, then.
Well, that's where we differ. I do stupidly risky things because what I
do is up to me. And because it's fun. Cowering in fear ain't my trip.
And DPR? He got nailed because he made too many stupid mistakes. And
some of his collaborators got nailed because one of those stupid
mistakes was keeping records, including images of their fucking
passports, on his fucking laptop. Which he stupidly carried around, and
let the feds grab while FDE was unlocked.
There is no "doesn't get promoted". Go promote it yourself.
Whatever, dude :)
I mean, one of your peers.
It was in the news a couple years ago. There's even a notice on the
Freenet website about it. Making excuses. That ex cop in Philadelphia,
who's still jailed for refusing to disclose his FDE passphrase, was one
of them.
For background on the Black Ice Project, see
You have no clue who funded Freenet, do you?
First, I _always_ use Tor via nested VPN chains. Using Whonix to
mitigate against leaks. Or between remote servers and VPS that I've
leased as anonymously as possible, via nested VPN chains and Tor, using
well-mixed Bitcoin.
Second, I _never_ share anything online, even via nested VPN chains and
Tor, that could link to my meatspace identity.
Good one :)
You're joking, right?
OK, how about  aka y5fmhyqdr6r7ddws.onion aka
ecc-anarplex.i2p aka anarplex.cryptogroup?
Lots of dark markets too. And lots of CP, if you're into that shit. But
hey, that's mostly what Freenet is good for ;) And lots of about
anything you can imagine.
Such as which is a backup of the Black Ice Project stuff that got taken down.
which covers SOD with amazing candor.
Yeah, yeah, yeah ...
Dude, many .onion marketplaces and child porn forums remain. It's just
that the clueless ones got nailed. Also the ones that CMU people found,
exploiting a bug in Tor.

Sure, there are better options. But they're not currently implemented at
useful scale. How can you use a mix network that exists only as an
academic paper, and perhaps some tens of people testing it?
OK, that helps maybe a little. But you've been online for many years,
and I'm sure that you have friends and associates. So organize some
cutting-edge mix network. Maybe Riffle, developed by Young Hyun Kwon.[1]
Or whatever you think better. And damn, I'll even help, if you like :)
Maybe to you I seem insufficiently critical. But maybe ask Tor devs ;)
Almost certainly, because it's distributed. But in my experience, the
Freenet community doesn't like people using proxies.
That's because I2P has very few clearnet exits, so all you see is stuff
hosted on I2P. One of the major Russian marketplaces is (or was) on I2P.
Also lots of porn and CP, predictably.
What's nice about Tor is that relay operators attract the most
attention. And it's my impression that they're generally not up to any
iffy shit. Or at least, they shouldn't be, if they're smart. So people
up to iffy shit just run clients. And that doesn't attract as much
attention. Especially if they use bridges that aren't published. Or
create their own bridge, on some random VPS.
So whatever. It's the thing now, for kids. But it does seem to work
pretty well.
Sure, but didn't know that it was still up. Is it?
I mean, damn, I can't find any music on TPB! That sucks.
Yeah, well, in this case you're right :(
We agree on that :)
The root issue isn't where Augur's website runs. The issue is trading
Ethereum anonymously.
That's a feature, not a bug, they say.
Yeah, but you can't do anything unless the client is synced.
Yeah, that's what I do with Bitcoin.
Yes. But whatever version of Jim's AP you're considering, I guarantee
that it will involve managing remote servers.
Damn ;)
It's in their contracts, probably ;)
I tell them that, if they want to buy and sell illegal drugs over the
net, they ought to use some mix of VPNs and Tor. Just because it's
almost certainly better than just using clearnet. But I also typically
point out that giving your real mail address to some online drug dealer
is risky. They could be a narc, or compromised. They could get busted,
with their address list. Packages could be delivered, with cops waiting
across the street.
Do you have sources that show otherwise? If not, then all you have is
some story based on your preconceptions.
Tell that to someone facing charges, and expert witnesses that a jury
believes. But whatever.
No idea, myself.
Not a VPN hop. AT least three hops, using different VPN services.
It's hard to say. My best guess is that they can intercept essentially
everything. But that it's still at least nontrivial, and perhaps not yet
feasible, to trace particular connections through multiple hops. But
really, who knows?
OK, let me see. I don't spend much time on .onion sites. Many sites did
disappear over the past year or two. A couple huge hosting operations
were taken down. Ast least some of that was CMU fallout.
Or a honeypot ;)
No, the point there was that there's more on the web than NYT etc.
Yeah, whatever. Let me see what I can find :)

OK, I'm glad. We at least agree that better anonymity networks are
needed. In particular, higher-latency mix networks with padding. And I
think that we agree that lack of demand has stalled implementation, even
though there have been proposals.
And so, I'm going to drop the rest of the discussion about this, because
I'm tired of it ;) I was serious about Riffle, though :)
Ummm, no :) There are still many extreme .onion sites. Mainly "hard
candy". A quick scan yielded eight that were up when I checked:
Child a Priori - because children always come first
Dark Scandals [pwned cam whores]
Hijab FUCK Girls
Little Cute Girls
Loli Lust
Sea Kitten Palace [gore, torture and Disney]
Teen Deepthroat
videos for Bitcoin
Youngest Girls
Even so, the collections on Freenet are far more extensive.
OK, so I have spent a few hours rooting around for .onion sites. There
are multiple forks of The Hidden Wiki, plus a hard candy fork:
The Hidden Wiki [semi censored version]
The Uncensored Hidden Wiki [but no hard candy]
Central Park [including some hard candy]
Then there are a few search engines:
Ahima [search, fast, doesn't return many dead sites]
not Evil [search, returns many dead sites, some marked as dead]
OnionLand Search Engine [heavily censored]
Also some discussion sites:
Galaxy3 [general discussion]
Hidden Answers [very diverse]
The Hub [dark marketplace stuff]
I did find a few cracking/hacking sites:
0day [hacking forum, also clearnet]
AN0NYM0US'z F0RUM [hacking forum]
Codex [cracking forum]
Torum ["cyber security" forum]
But most of the old standards are gone, such as Dark0de, Mazafaka and
Trojanforge. And "not Evil" returns numerous dead cracking/hacking
.onion URLs.
So anyway, it's my guess that most of the cracking/hacking sites, and
lots of other weird shit, were on shared .onion hosting that's been
taken down. And conversely, it's arguable that the surviving hard candy
sites are self hosted. Survival of the fittest, you know. But of course,
it's also possible (or even likely) that those hard candy sites are just
honeypots. As Playpen was, in the FBI's Operation Pacifier.
That's rather sad. But maybe now there's a strong market for secure
.onion hosting services :)

That's why I mentioned biological weapons. If you're careful, with good
OPSEC, you can remain undetected until you act. And if you act
decisively enough, with a well-designed agent, it doesn't matter if
you're promptly captured or killed. Or at least, that won't stop the
epidemic. If you did an adequate job at design, anyway.

Now _that's_ funny! You're Jewish or Christian, I'm guessing, given your
use of "devil". But Judaism, Christianity and Islam all worship the same
God. Both Christians and Muslims expect that Christ will be resurrected.
And that he'll lead them to victory over the other. I'm not sure what
the Jews think of that. Israel will be the battleground, of course.
And what about this "devil" thing? Isn't there just one god? If that's
so, Satan is just one aspect of God. Who must truly be one psychotic
I highly recommend Matthew Stover's novels (except for the Star Wars
stuff). His first two, _Iron Dawn_ and _Jericho Moon_, take place in the
Middle East, on the eastern edge of the Egyptian Empire, a decade or so
after the Trojan War ended. _Jericho Moon_ is basically about the
Maccabee Revolution, from the Seleucid perspective.
The Maccabees (Hebrews) come off basically as devil worshipers ;) They
conjure various aspects (aka angels) of Yahweh to smite their enemies.
Using the standard stuff. You know, pentagrams, burning ram's blood in
charcoal braziers, chanting, etc. And two of those aspects were Shachath
(Angel of Death) and Mastema (aka Satan).
Shit happens.

_Accelerando_ and the "Flower Prince" trilogy both explore virtual

away in _Diaspora_, through multiple levels of reality, but in the end

that the "Flower Prince" trilogy has a happy ending for some, everyone

Yeah, that was probably it. In practice, statists will have the best

I'm not really into utopian. Dystopian is more fun. If you enjoy
fantasy, I highly recommend Joe Abercrombie's "The First Law" trilogy.
It's rather a satire on "The Lord of the Rings" trilogy. Also Matthew
Stover's "Caine" series. Caine basically channels Aleister Crowley ;)

Yeah, Rajaniemi's "Flower Prince" trilogy is awesome. It doesn't have
quite the visceral punch of Abercrombie's stuff. Or Morgan's stuff. Or
Stover's Caine stuff. But damn, Jean le Flambeur is a trip. He's a riff
on Arsène Lupin, Maurice Leblanc's gentleman thief.
And actually, "he" is inaccurate. Because the novels feature several
copies of him. One copy, Jean le Roi, is a distinct character. And at
the start of _The Quantum Thief_, millions of copies are undergoing
selection for cooperation ...
And going back further, Jean le Flambeur is a synthetic construct,
created by Sobornost Founder (one of seven) Joséphine Pellegrini, to
serve her. But various copies of him have rebelled and escaped. I gather
that she's a riff on Countess of Cagliostro, from Maurice Leblanc's
novels. Gotta read those.
Mieli, the other main character, also serves Joséphine Pellegrini. She
seems extremely naive, albeit a fierce warrior. But there's much more to
her than that. There's a very deep game, which I won't ruin for y'all.
Thanks. I need more new stuff. I've reread Stover's Caine novels _many_
times. Because I love the action! And also because the plot (if you can
call it that) is extremely convoluted and branched. It's vaguely similar
to Heinlein's _All You Zombies_, but no where near as obvious.

wearing a Michael Myers mask. How does does the killer profit on Augur?
Digging a little, I see that Etherium wallets sync using UDP, so Tor is

Cory Doctorow is cool, and all, but his fiction is ~lame. I like the

I'm rather into action porn, so hey.
Anyway, I'm reminded of Old Bill Burroughs' stuff about the rich
planning to escape Earth on nuclear-pulse-driven ships. He didn't flesh
it out, but it basically involved planetary-scale destruction.
Now of course, the g-forces involved would have killed everyone in the
ships. But consider Vinge's ships, combining bobble tech with nuclear
pulse propulsion. Bobbles, for those who don't know Vinge's stuff, are
spherical stasis fields. Inside the bobble, time stops for some set
external time. So from the outside, bobbles are perfect spherical
mirrors. To everything, including acceleration. And you can have a
complex structure, with configurations of bobbles nested within bobbles.
So basically, the ship periodically drops a nuclear device, bobbles and
rides the shock wave, and then de-bobbles and repeats. And there's no
limit to the size of the nuclear devices. Could be the entire planet :(

OK, so the prediction is "dead by 2019-01-01 00:00:00.000000000-00:00".
By late 2018, the odds against that are ramping up. And so is the
security level, I suppose. But anyway, at some time, the assassin (or
whoever's in control) places a huge bet. And watches the odds, and
monitors security etc. Then the assassin completes the job, and wins
big. Unless captured or killed, of course. Others who didn't fold also
win big, but hey.
That also works. But much better is Steven Schear's proposal (next post

depending on precision of the prediction. That mitigates against
increasing security when nearing the end of the prediction period.

I'm not so worried about my guns, because I bought them all informally
for cash, and there are no public records :) And I no longer buy or sell
"illegal" drugs.
My only substantial risk factor is online activity. But all that's
visible is a VPN connection. And many people use VPNs these days. For
casual stuff, I use nested VPN chains. Plus Tor for stuff that I really
care about. So I'm not too worried.
But I do wonder what I'd do if they "came for me". All my machines are
full-disk encrypted. And the power strip to the UPS is about two meters
away as I type. So I could shut everything down fast enough.
Still, do I want to deal with the hassle? I have a lawyer on retainer.
But they'd impound all my stuff, and demand FDE passphrases. Life would
suck, maybe for a long while. Say, if I were jailed for contempt.
But you know, at some point suicide by cop will look like the best
option. I have my combat pump 12 gauge, with pistol grips and laser
sight. With alternating buckshot and slugs. And I've been thinking about
a simple design for a "fire bomb", for diversion. Basically, a ~500 ml
plastic bottle, ~2/3 full of kerosene, with a 12 gauge blank on top. I'd
use a simple firing pin, comprising a spring with a ratchet and string.
On the other hand, maybe I'll just die in my sleep :)

Yeah, good point. But hey, they're probably about free on eBay.
Right. I'd forgotten about multisession recording on CD-R:[0]
That in itself wouldn't be very useful for a system running from the
CD-R, because it would nuke itself by doing multisession recording.
But ...
So yeah, stuff could probably be written. Maybe it'd help to use all
disk capacity when writing, by appending random-data file(s) at the end
of the write. But ...
That's over my head. Maybe there are gaps in tracks, which could be used
to store new data. Or maybe it's possible to write slightly off track,
without hosing existing data. I have no clue.
Those are good points. So what? Paper tape, in a reader that can't punch
holes? But seriously, using CD readers with wimpy lasers that can't
alter the disks is probably best.

I worked on this for a while. I was thinking about compartmentalizing
services in multiple Raspberry Pi, connected via opto-isolators. Like
Markus Ottela's Tinfoil Chat,[0] but expanded to work more like Qubes.
And indeed, the Qubes team have announced work on Qubes Air:[1]
But, you know, I wondered about EMF cross-talk between qubes. So I
decided to learn how to measure that :)
Maybe a little ;)
Yeah, me neither. But no trust :(
I tried that approach. And it was a nightmare. The setup -- SDR stick,
upconverter and laptop -- generated far too much EMF noise. I played
with testing stuff in a Faraday cage. But I didn't manage a signal feed
to the SDR etc that didn't introduce unacceptable noise.
I believe that you'd need professional equipment, which is properly
shielded, and doesn't bleed noise into the testing environment.
That is also harder that it might seem. For high frequencies, with very
small wavelengths, even tiny cracks are enough to leak horribly. You
need joints with elastic seals, to mitigate against misalignment and
wear. Such as beryllium copper finger strips, elastic beryllium copper
tubular braid, etc.

Basically because professional signal/spectrum analyzers cost so much.
For example, used Tektronix RSA306 (9kHz to 6.2GHz) go for ~$3000. And
you really want something that detects higher frequencies, such as an
Anritsu MS2850A (9 kHz to 44.5 GHz). I can't even find used ones, but
I'm guessing several $1000.
Maybe less-expensive alternatives that are good enough. I find a lot on

But ignoring stuff over ~6GHz might be problematic.

I'm not so worried about my guns, because I bought them all informally
for cash, and there are no public records :) And I no longer buy or sell
"illegal" drugs.
My only substantial risk factor is online activity. But all that's
visible is a VPN connection. And many people use VPNs these days. For
casual stuff, I use nested VPN chains. Plus Tor for stuff that I really
care about. So I'm not too worried.
But I do wonder what I'd do if they "came for me". All my machines are
full-disk encrypted. And the power strip to the UPS is about two meters
away as I type. So I could shut everything down fast enough.
Still, do I want to deal with the hassle? I have a lawyer on retainer.
But they'd impound all my stuff, and demand FDE passphrases. Life would
suck, maybe for a long while. Say, if I were jailed for contempt.
But you know, at some point suicide by cop will look like the best
option. I have my combat pump 12 gauge, with pistol grips and laser
sight. With alternating buckshot and slugs. And I've been thinking about
a simple design for a "fire bomb", for diversion. Basically, a ~500 ml
plastic bottle, ~2/3 full of kerosene, with a 12 gauge blank on top. I'd
use a simple firing pin, comprising a spring with a ratchet and string.

Well, damn bro, _you will love_ Stover's _Iron Dawn_ and _Jericho Moon_!
If you can get past the somewhat inelegant writing, anyway. It was his
first published stuff, after all. They take place about a decade after
the Trojan War, as the Hebrew Maccabees were initially rising against
the Seleucid Empire, a few years after the fall of Jericho.
_Jericho Moon_ focuses on the failed siege of Jebusi (Jerusalem),
several hundred years before it actually fell to the Hebrews. It's got
some good stuff about the relationship of El, Asherah's consort, to
Yahweh Saboth, El Shaddai. And Hebrew practices of summoning Shahkhath.

So why are Israel and Saudi Arabia working together? Just US links?

@_date: 2018-09-11 07:00:10
@_author: Mirimir 
@_subject: latest false flag attack? 
OK, so I don't have any primary evidence. Except that I was near enough
to Jersey City, when the first plane hit, that I quickly got to a pier,
and watched the second plane hit. And sat there, drinking coffee, while
the rest of it went down. And then I've followed the story, more or less
closely, for 17 years.
What I can say is that there was definitely a second plane, and that the
main towers eventually pretty much pancaked, with some sideways lean. So
the idea that the planes took them down seems quite plausible.
But who was responsible? I have no clue, of course. I'm just some
anonymous coward. My best guess is a Pearl Harbor sort of scenario.
Basically, after the Soviet Union collapsed, the US military was looking
for someone/something else to fight.
The Middle East was the obvious choice. There had been lots of proxy
conflict with the Soviets. And they'd developed lots of great assets.
Especially in Afghanistan, involving fundamentalist Saudis. And in Iraq
vs Soviet-friendly Iran. Plus Israel, of course, and its conflict with
Soviet-friendly Syria and (at the time) Soviet-friendly Egypt. And poor
Lebanon and the Palestinians, more-or-less friendly with evil Iran and
Syria. And then there's Kissinger's long-term plan to destabilize the
Middle East, and ensure access to affordable oil.
So eventually it all came together. Iraq was threatening to ramp up oil
production, and sell in Euros. Neither the US nor the Saudis wanted
that. Instead, the US wanted to keep Iraq's oil reserves relatively
undeveloped, and its society chaotic and easily dominated. Israel also
wanted chaos in the Middle East, to facilitate expansion, which the US
would bless.
Basically, the US and Saudis manipulated Al-Qaeda into planning the
attacks. The US military and Israeli Mossad monitored developments, and
made sure that the attackers weren't caught. Perhaps the plan didn't
include actually taking the World Trade Center down, or seriously
damaging the Pentagon and White House. That is, maybe stuff just got out
of hand. Or maybe they really did want something that would take the US
into the Middle East, just as Pearl Harbor took it into WWII.
Anyway, that's my working hypothesis, such as it is.

@_date: 2018-09-11 07:06:13
@_author: Mirimir 
@_subject: latest false flag attack? 
I have no serious doubt that the attackers were Saudi.
I just wonder who orchestrated the attack.
I mean, nobody questions that it wasn't Japanese planes that attacked
Pearl Harbor. And that the Japanese military planned it. But it's pretty
clear that the US manipulated the Japanese into attacking, to create a
pretext for entering WWII. Which most Americans had been opposing.
So anyway, the two stories seem very similar to me.

@_date: 2018-09-11 14:04:14
@_author: Mirimir 
@_subject: latest false flag attack? 
Thanks :) Now that I see that, I do vaguely remember it. But you know,
17 years ago :( But OK, we don't know for sure that they were Saudis.
What's the evidence for that? Lots of planes were hijacked over the
years, from US airports. It's just that none of the hijackers knew how
to fly them. So why is it impossible that a bunch of guys could have
gone to flight schools, and then hijacked some planes?
I have no opinion. But it is a truism that those with extreme opinions
tend to be government agents ;)

Everything but the steel parts burned. Including all the aluminum and
copper. And that was without forced draft.
I've also burned steel. But that took a methane-oxygen flame. And it was
very dramatic. Even more so than magnesium. With lots of pops, and
splattering molten steel.

Hey. I suspect that most of us here consider that the US military (what
some call red team) orchestrated the attack, or at least played some
nontrivial role. What we're left with is the mechanics.
That is, was it planes that did the major damage? Or was it demolition
charges or missiles or whatever? It's almost a certainty that something
hit the WTC towers. As far as I know, there's just one video of the
first hit, and no plane is visible.[0] However, there are many videos
showing the second impact, and the FDR Drive one clearly shows an
incoming airliner.[1]
If there was a first plane, and if it came in from the same direction as
the second one, it would not likely have been visible in the video,
because it would have hit the far side of the tower. Consistent with
that, the video shows debris exiting toward the camera.[0] Also, I
gather that it was the sound of an incoming plane that drew the
attention of the Naudet brothers and the firefighters that they were
filming. But sure, it could have instead been a missile. Unless there's
physical evidence for a first plane, that is.
So in NYC, there was at least one plane, and likely two. Does it really
matter whether there were also demolition charges planted in the
buildings that collapsed? I can imagine that they were placed as backup,
just in case the planes or missiles didn't do the job.
I've found no video that clearly shows a plane hitting the Pentagon.
More than just one frame with a blob that could be a plane's nose. I
gather that Air Traffic Control became aware that American Airlines
Flight 77 had gone off its planned course, and was heading toward the
Pentagon.[2] Also, a few post-impact photos released by the FBI show
debris from an American Airlines plane.[3] That could have come from
anywhere, I suppose. But lots of people claim that they saw a plane hit
But again, does it really matter whether there was a plane, or just a
missile? As long as we're assuming that the US military orchestrated the
attack, or at least played some nontrivial role, that is ;)

Sorry, I was being careless. You believe that it was the blue team. The
main player being the State Department, plus the FBI and (I'm guessing)
the CIA. And that the blue team, mainly the military, and including (I'm
guessing) the NSA.
I gather that BushII was a CIA asset, so the 9/11 attacks were part of
his (or rather, Chaney's) game plan. Cheney was part of Iran-Contra, a
CIA operation. And a cohort in that, Lee Hamilton, went on to whitewash
Chaney's role in 9/11. And of course, we can't forget Condoleezza Rice,
who served as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State under W.
Anyway, back to the point. I gather that Juan holds the US government
responsible for 9/11. And he focuses mainly on the military, which is
Jim's red team. But I suspect that Juan hates all aspects of the US
government, more or less equally. So is that accurate, Juan? And could
you agree that it developed out of an internal power structute=r

Hey, we all get stuck in being right, at times. But I believe that my
opinions are generally not dogmatic, and that I'm open to evidence and
argument. And I do revise opinions when convinced by evidence and/or
argument. Also, I generally don't profess opinions when unqualified.
For example, the recent paper Nasr, Bahramali and Houmansadr (2018)
DeepCorr: Strong Flow Correlation Attacks on Tor Using Deep Learning
 does decrease my confidence in
Tor and VPN chains. But in my opinion, that's still the best existing
approach for online anonymity. Except maybe for chained botnet proxies,
but that's too morally iffy.
So hey, please do call me out if I'm being dogmatic :)
I'm not arguing that you ought to accept them. Just that it might be
useful to consider them, to see if there's anything sensible in them.
If I did, I suppose that it would be. But even though I may at times be
dogmatic and stubborn, it's still useful to raise the issue.
Commonly, debates become acrimonious, positions harden, and participants
seem to focus on winning. Rather than on revising their opinions, in
light of evidence and argument. And rudeness makes it worse, because
people tend to get triggered.

Yes, I looked at all the pictures. And in my opinion, it's really hard
to tell exactly what's happening.
Also, as I've said, I don't really care. I strongly suspect that the US
government was somehow actively involved. Or at least, that it was a
rogue operation, involving such (maybe not really former) CIA assets as
Usama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Ladin and his associates. That is, it
was fundamentally a false-flag attack.
And if that's the case, it doesn't really matter what mix of planes,
missiles and demolition charges ended up doing the damage. That's rather
a distraction. What's interesting is who did it, and why.

I agree on the Mueller part. But Trump, I doubt that he's really Red
State. He's pretty clearly a tool of the Russian Mafia. He presumably
made connections in NYC and Atlantic City, back in the day. And he
eventually came to depend on them for funding. Because he had shafted so
many US lenders that nobody trusted him. But your Russian Mafia, they
don't worry about trust ;)
The Red State camp have never really accepted Trump. They accepted him
at first only because he won the fucking election. But he's rewarded
them in many ways, so they play along. But I bet that the NSA could blow
him away, if they really wanted to. Except that it would likely really
fuck shit up, so they're laying low.
I agree with you on that. But I suspect that Trump's game is orthogonal
to the red-blue conflict.

Yeah, this is the meat. This fucking "safe space" crap just bugs the
shit out of me. I guess that it's just part of getting old. My values of
freedom (academic, political, social, sexual, etc) and self expression
got established in the 60's. For example, the freedom to discuss and
teach the theory of evolution.
But now, it's become difficult to objectively research possible
differences among protected categories, such as genders, races or sexual
orientations. There are exceptions, for sure, such as differences in
response to diet recommendations, medical treatment, or drug therapy.
But otherwise, it can be a minefield. Student protests. Difficulty with
funding. Tenure blocks. Difficulty publishing.
So just how is that different from fundamentalist Christians blocking
the theory of evolution from school curricula? Or, I admit, from
academic discrimination against climate-change skeptics?
Anyway, there's failure to make a key distinction. Sexism or racism
involve judging people on the basis of their gender or race. They're
classic examples of faulty generalization and universal instantiation.
Because people are just way too fucking complicated to analyze with such
simplistic reasoning. In particular, distributions are far too wide for
that stuff to be useful. Or, for that matter, fair.
But that's not the case for experimental studies of differences. You're
just collecting and analyzing data. There are, of course, confounding
issues that complicate interpretation of results. Humans are so readily
programmable that it's very difficult, and perhaps impossible, to
attribute any observed differences to biological hardware vs cultural
influences. But that's just something for the discussion. It's not a
valid reason to block the work.
However, the very idea of such research seems to violate "safe space"
for some. And the idea that some work shouldn't be done, because it
upsets or discourages some protected group, is very dangerous. It's
contrary to the overall concept of the scientific endeavor.
And yes, it is arguable that some research just shouldn't be done.
Nuclear research, for example. And now, machine-learning and AI. But
even there, refusing to look seems ultimately pointless. Because
somebody else will, and then maybe you're screwed.

maybe top Saudis are actually Jewish. I mean, it's just a technical
difference. Not that they believe that religious shit, in any case.

Well, damn bro, _you will love_ Stover's _Iron Dawn_ and _Jericho Moon_!
If you can get past the somewhat inelegant writing, anyway. It was his
first published stuff, after all. They take place about a decade after
the Trojan War, as the Hebrew Maccabees were initially rising against
the Seleucid Empire, a few years after the fall of Jericho.
_Jericho Moon_ focuses on the failed siege of Jebusi (Jerusalem),
several hundred years before it actually fell to the Hebrews. It's got
some good stuff about the relationship of El, Asherah's consort, to
Yahweh Saboth, El Shaddai. And Hebrew practices of summoning Shahkhath.

So why are Israel and Saudi Arabia working together? Just US links?

@_date: 2018-09-11 07:00:10
@_author: Mirimir 
@_subject: latest false flag attack? 
OK, so I don't have any primary evidence. Except that I was near enough
to Jersey City, when the first plane hit, that I quickly got to a pier,
and watched the second plane hit. And sat there, drinking coffee, while
the rest of it went down. And then I've followed the story, more or less
closely, for 17 years.
What I can say is that there was definitely a second plane, and that the
main towers eventually pretty much pancaked, with some sideways lean. So
the idea that the planes took them down seems quite plausible.
But who was responsible? I have no clue, of course. I'm just some
anonymous coward. My best guess is a Pearl Harbor sort of scenario.
Basically, after the Soviet Union collapsed, the US military was looking
for someone/something else to fight.
The Middle East was the obvious choice. There had been lots of proxy
conflict with the Soviets. And they'd developed lots of great assets.
Especially in Afghanistan, involving fundamentalist Saudis. And in Iraq
vs Soviet-friendly Iran. Plus Israel, of course, and its conflict with
Soviet-friendly Syria and (at the time) Soviet-friendly Egypt. And poor
Lebanon and the Palestinians, more-or-less friendly with evil Iran and
Syria. And then there's Kissinger's long-term plan to destabilize the
Middle East, and ensure access to affordable oil.
So eventually it all came together. Iraq was threatening to ramp up oil
production, and sell in Euros. Neither the US nor the Saudis wanted
that. Instead, the US wanted to keep Iraq's oil reserves relatively
undeveloped, and its society chaotic and easily dominated. Israel also
wanted chaos in the Middle East, to facilitate expansion, which the US
would bless.
Basically, the US and Saudis manipulated Al-Qaeda into planning the
attacks. The US military and Israeli Mossad monitored developments, and
made sure that the attackers weren't caught. Perhaps the plan didn't
include actually taking the World Trade Center down, or seriously
damaging the Pentagon and White House. That is, maybe stuff just got out
of hand. Or maybe they really did want something that would take the US
into the Middle East, just as Pearl Harbor took it into WWII.
Anyway, that's my working hypothesis, such as it is.

@_date: 2018-09-11 07:06:13
@_author: Mirimir 
@_subject: latest false flag attack? 
I have no serious doubt that the attackers were Saudi.
I just wonder who orchestrated the attack.
I mean, nobody questions that it wasn't Japanese planes that attacked
Pearl Harbor. And that the Japanese military planned it. But it's pretty
clear that the US manipulated the Japanese into attacking, to create a
pretext for entering WWII. Which most Americans had been opposing.
So anyway, the two stories seem very similar to me.

@_date: 2018-09-11 14:04:14
@_author: Mirimir 
@_subject: latest false flag attack? 
Thanks :) Now that I see that, I do vaguely remember it. But you know,
17 years ago :( But OK, we don't know for sure that they were Saudis.
What's the evidence for that? Lots of planes were hijacked over the
years, from US airports. It's just that none of the hijackers knew how
to fly them. So why is it impossible that a bunch of guys could have
gone to flight schools, and then hijacked some planes?
I have no opinion. But it is a truism that those with extreme opinions
tend to be government agents ;)
So what's your opinion of the standard Pearl Harbor story?

I have :) At times, I've disposed of HDDs by burning them. In a 25 liter
steel drum, with holes punched around the bottom, for draft. I used dry
oak, started with kerosene, and juiced occasionally with paraffin.
Everything but the steel parts burned. Including all the aluminum and
copper. And that was without forced draft.
I've also burned steel. But that took a methane-oxygen flame. And it was
very dramatic. Even more so than magnesium. With lots of pops, and
splattering molten steel.

Hey. I suspect that most of us here consider that the US military (what
some call red team) orchestrated the attack, or at least played some
nontrivial role. What we're left with is the mechanics.
That is, was it planes that did the major damage? Or was it demolition
charges or missiles or whatever? It's almost a certainty that something
hit the WTC towers. As far as I know, there's just one video of the
first hit, and no plane is visible.[0] However, there are many videos
showing the second impact, and the FDR Drive one clearly shows an
incoming airliner.[1]
If there was a first plane, and if it came in from the same direction as
the second one, it would not likely have been visible in the video,
because it would have hit the far side of the tower. Consistent with
that, the video shows debris exiting toward the camera.[0] Also, I
gather that it was the sound of an incoming plane that drew the
attention of the Naudet brothers and the firefighters that they were
filming. But sure, it could have instead been a missile. Unless there's
physical evidence for a first plane, that is.
So in NYC, there was at least one plane, and likely two. Does it really
matter whether there were also demolition charges planted in the
buildings that collapsed? I can imagine that they were placed as backup,
just in case the planes or missiles didn't do the job.
I've found no video that clearly shows a plane hitting the Pentagon.
More than just one frame with a blob that could be a plane's nose. I
gather that Air Traffic Control became aware that American Airlines
Flight 77 had gone off its planned course, and was heading toward the
Pentagon.[2] Also, a few post-impact photos released by the FBI show
debris from an American Airlines plane.[3] That could have come from
anywhere, I suppose. But lots of people claim that they saw a plane hit
But again, does it really matter whether there was a plane, or just a
missile? As long as we're assuming that the US military orchestrated the
attack, or at least played some nontrivial role, that is ;)

Sorry, I was being careless. You believe that it was the blue team. The
main player being the State Department, plus the FBI and (I'm guessing)
the CIA. And that the blue team, mainly the military, and including (I'm
guessing) the NSA.
I gather that BushII was a CIA asset, so the 9/11 attacks were part of
his (or rather, Chaney's) game plan. Cheney was part of Iran-Contra, a
CIA operation. And a cohort in that, Lee Hamilton, went on to whitewash
Chaney's role in 9/11. And of course, we can't forget Condoleezza Rice,
who served as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State under W.
Anyway, back to the point. I gather that Juan holds the US government
responsible for 9/11. And he focuses mainly on the military, which is
Jim's red team. But I suspect that Juan hates all aspects of the US
government, more or less equally. So is that accurate, Juan? And could
you agree that it developed out of an internal power structute=r

Hey, we all get stuck in being right, at times. But I believe that my
opinions are generally not dogmatic, and that I'm open to evidence and
argument. And I do revise opinions when convinced by evidence and/or
argument. Also, I generally don't profess opinions when unqualified.
For example, the recent paper Nasr, Bahramali and Houmansadr (2018)
DeepCorr: Strong Flow Correlation Attacks on Tor Using Deep Learning
 does decrease my confidence in
Tor and VPN chains. But in my opinion, that's still the best existing
approach for online anonymity. Except maybe for chained botnet proxies,
but that's too morally iffy.
So hey, please do call me out if I'm being dogmatic :)
I'm not arguing that you ought to accept them. Just that it might be
useful to consider them, to see if there's anything sensible in them.
If I did, I suppose that it would be. But even though I may at times be
dogmatic and stubborn, it's still useful to raise the issue.
Commonly, debates become acrimonious, positions harden, and participants
seem to focus on winning. Rather than on revising their opinions, in
light of evidence and argument. And rudeness makes it worse, because
people tend to get triggered.

Yes, I looked at all the pictures. And in my opinion, it's really hard
to tell exactly what's happening.
Also, as I've said, I don't really care. I strongly suspect that the US
government was somehow actively involved. Or at least, that it was a
rogue operation, involving such (maybe not really former) CIA assets as
Usama bin Mohammed bin Awad bin Ladin and his associates. That is, it
was fundamentally a false-flag attack.
And if that's the case, it doesn't really matter what mix of planes,
missiles and demolition charges ended up doing the damage. That's rather
a distraction. What's interesting is who did it, and why.

I agree on the Mueller part. But Trump, I doubt that he's really Red
State. He's pretty clearly a tool of the Russian Mafia. He presumably
made connections in NYC and Atlantic City, back in the day. And he
eventually came to depend on them for funding. Because he had shafted so
many US lenders that nobody trusted him. But your Russian Mafia, they
don't worry about trust ;)
The Red State camp have never really accepted Trump. They accepted him
at first only because he won the fucking election. But he's rewarded
them in many ways, so they play along. But I bet that the NSA could blow
him away, if they really wanted to. Except that it would likely really
fuck shit up, so they're laying low.
I agree with you on that. But I suspect that Trump's game is orthogonal
to the red-blue conflict.

Yeah, this is the meat. This fucking "safe space" crap just bugs the
shit out of me. I guess that it's just part of getting old. My values of
freedom (academic, political, social, sexual, etc) and self expression
got established in the 60's. For example, the freedom to discuss and
teach the theory of evolution.
But now, it's become difficult to objectively research possible
differences among protected categories, such as genders, races or sexual
orientations. There are exceptions, for sure, such as differences in
response to diet recommendations, medical treatment, or drug therapy.
But otherwise, it can be a minefield. Student protests. Difficulty with
funding. Tenure blocks. Difficulty publishing.
So just how is that different from fundamentalist Christians blocking
the theory of evolution from school curricula? Or, I admit, from
academic discrimination against climate-change skeptics?
Anyway, there's failure to make a key distinction. Sexism or racism
involve judging people on the basis of their gender or race. They're
classic examples of faulty generalization and universal instantiation.
Because people are just way too fucking complicated to analyze with such
simplistic reasoning. In particular, distributions are far too wide for
that stuff to be useful. Or, for that matter, fair.
But that's not the case for experimental studies of differences. You're
just collecting and analyzing data. There are, of course, confounding
issues that complicate interpretation of results. Humans are so readily
programmable that it's very difficult, and perhaps impossible, to
attribute any observed differences to biological hardware vs cultural
influences. But that's just something for the discussion. It's not a
valid reason to block the work.
However, the very idea of such research seems to violate "safe space"
for some. And the idea that some work shouldn't be done, because it
upsets or discourages some protected group, is very dangerous. It's
contrary to the overall concept of the scientific endeavor.
And yes, it is arguable that some research just shouldn't be done.
Nuclear research, for example. And now, machine-learning and AI. But
even there, refusing to look seems ultimately pointless. Because
somebody else will, and then maybe you're screwed.

Yeah, good point. Say what you want about Freenet, that rabbit just

also encrypt local storage and temp files.
And those are all key features of the best distributed storage systems.
What distinguishes them is mainly usability as a filesystem. Such as
FUSE, which Freenet just doesn't do. It's basically ftp.
Also, Freenet in opennet mode is such a fucking deadfall for the
clueless. It's not uncommon for people to install it, come across
extreme child porn, and then freak. And the community seems generally
hostile to the idea of obscuring IP addresses.
However, all of these distributed storage systems are similarly
vulnerable, more or less. You are potentially screwed if an adversary
can 1) peer directly with you, and get your IP address; and 2) send you
file fragments that are (even though encrypted) identifiable by hash or
whatever. If you didn't encrypt locally, they may find bad stuff (even
if only as temp files). And if you did encrypt locally, they may jail
you for contempt unless you reveal the passphrase(s).
So anyway, if you use any of these distributed storage systems, make
sure that you peer only with people you trust, and make sure that you
encrypt everything, locally and in transit. And if you must peer
promiscuously, make sure that you obscure your IP address. Use a VPN, at

Why would you speculate about someone "guessing" your password, or Vince
"playing games", after John clearly said that he spoofed some header?
You can bullshit all you want, but it was a dumb thing to say, and it
makes you look like an idiot. And it makes me wonder whether he actually

about spoofed messages from your CockMail account. And I thought that
you were referring to John's message that you replied to, not this other
message, "Boomerhedge - Boomer Propaganda Cesspool".
But seriously, that one is even less well spoofed.

But now I'm curious. Could someone please share the Message-IDs of the
spoofed messages? I'd like to dump the headers in Calc or whatever, and
see what there is to see. I do use CockMail, so I'd be concerned if it
were unusually vulnerable to spoofing.
Also, it's not like header spoofing is hard. For example, with the
HeaderToolsLite plugin for Thunderbird.

Yes, Tor is low-latency. And is vulnerable to traffic analysis. And yet,
as you say, it's promoted to the clueless as resisting "network
surveillance and traffic analysis".
Which is, as you say, "outright criminal fraud".
Even so, if you read the Tor design document
you see that they're quite open about the limitations.
And so are Syverson's publications, which you've quoted a lot.
The villains here are writers of the Tor Project website. They bullshit
users, overselling Tor. Why, I don't know. Maybe it's all a honeypot. Or
maybe they're just idiots.
I've wondered whether it's just that they need lots of users for cover
traffic. That _was_ a major factor in opening Tor to the public, instead
of restricting it to government users. But that seems unlikely, now,
given that the NSA etc could easily run enough bots on hacked servers.

It could just be one of the standard malicious guard attacks. The risk

onion service getting pwned by a malicious guard are correspondingly

The false flag explanation is way too contrived and implausible.
For one thing, there's just too much evidence that implicates al-Qaeda.
And yes, I know that al-Qaeda started out as a CIA operation. But it
seems more likely that they went rogue. Although it is possible that the
CIA did 9/11, as part of some bizarre power struggle -- or yes, a false
flag. But more likely the Sauds or close friends were behind it, and
just not funding it as part of their fundamentalist education network.

That's possible, I agree. I just don't think that it's as likely.
Saudi Arabia and Israel are the major US assets in the Middle East. But
I think that it's misleading to call them "close". They've both had the
US by the balls since WWII at least. The Saudis because oil, and the
Israelis because so many politically active and wealthy Jews in the US.
So it's a cluster fuck, with everyone playing everyone else. And it's
suspicious that Israel is "closer" to Saudi Arabia than to any other
country in the area. But I have no clue what that's about.
Also, none of these countries are monolithic. And it's possible that
some factions from all three allied to do 9/11 as a pretext for more
fuckery in the Middle East. Given that the Soviet Union had collapsed,
and Russia was in chaos, and they needed major enemies to justify their
funding and influence.
Yeah, centuries of fucking. "US out of North America now!" and all that.
And yeah, it was a perfect excuse for the US to reassert world
dominance. However, doing an outright false flag is simplistic and
crude, and risky if it comes out. It's much better to manipulate your
enemies to do stuff that provides the excuse. An "indirect false flag".
I mean, it's arguable that the US manipulated Japan into attacking Pearl
Harbor. Or earlier, manipulated Germany into sinking US shipping in WWI,
which provided the pretext to join the war. It's all about building
public support for a war. Selling it as defense, not aggression.

I agree that "society" is vague. In most places, it means "governments",
given that they regulate vaccine testing, and typically need to
jawbone/bribe pharmaceutical firms to develop vaccines (which are
usually not very profitable, and litigation magnets).
But I suppose, in your happy anarchy, it could mean whatever cabrón
develops some vaccine.

I'm mocking the idea that anarchy is workable for the existing
population, generally. I do live in a community that's fundamentally
anarchic, although there is coordination and oversight through circles
with modified consensus. And it generally works pretty well.
However, it's a hugely self-selected community, with an explicit social
contract, and members who don't play well get shunned and booted. I
really don't think that such a community would work for random sheeple.
So what's your path to anarchy? Love? Education? Kill the assholes?
There are no rules here, my friend :)

I'm fundamentally a hedonist, in that having fun is my major goal in
life. But yes, I'm utilitarian. And a scientist.
I didn't say "above". Indeed, I'm among the least community minded here.
Right on the edge. It's just that I'm such a charming guy ;)
There's no right to be a member of a voluntary organization.
Who are you to define the "subject at hand"?
And it's a simple question, no? If you don't have an answer, I guess
that I default to mocking you for being uselessly dogmatic.
So you say.
I don't much care. We won't know how it will go for a year or two. It
could go away, or it could get worse, or another one could come along.
But human technological society is doomed, one way or another.
Being over 70, I'd rather not be surrounded by masses of infected
idiots. And damn, I'm glad that I don't live in Texas or California. Or
the South, generally. However, I do see the logic of letting old folks
die, and trashing the economy less. But then, a trashed economy releases
less CO2, so maybe that's a good thing.
So overall, I don't care much.

Thanks. I wasn't paying attention, but I did notice the warning about my

I'm not sure whether that was a cypherpunks server issue, or a Riseup
issue, which was perhaps triggered by a cypherpunks server issue.
A postmortem would be cool.

Looking in the public archive, the first hint of a problem was Georgi
Guninski's "pong" and Greg Newby's reply at Jun 15 05:25:59 PDT 2020:
Then there's the message from Greg at Jun 16 19:39:50 PDT 2020, saying
that the "the list was bouncing all day today (after around 9am US
Eastern Daylight Time)" and that "[t]hings now seem to be fixed":
But GTI.H and Georgi Guninski both reported on Jun 17 that they still
weren't getting list messages to Gmail accounts:
I got the last message before today at Jun 14 14:38:29 PDT 2020:
I got the membership disabled message at 18 Jun 2020 00:15:00 -0700, and
it said:
to excessive bounces The last bounce received from you was dated
18-Jun-2020.  You will not get any more messages from this list until
you re-enable your membership.  You will receive 2 more reminders like
this before your membership in the list is deleted.
That is, messages to me were bouncing from late Jun 14 through Jun 17.
Anyway, it's not a big deal. I'm just curious whether bouncing started
earlier, perhaps on Jun 14, and why Google and Riseup kept bouncing
messages after Greg fixed the cypherpunks server.

That means that it was Tails that failed. Because some process other
than Tor was able to reach the Internet. That should have been prevented
using iptables.
Even using Whonix would have rendered the video player exploit useless.
Because there is no path to the Internet, with forwarding disabled in
the gateway VM, and just Tor SocksPorts exposed to the workstation VM.

That's pretty much what I'm still up to.
Regarding all the crap, cypherpunks lists had just as much back in the
90s. And crap -- however that shows up for you -- is pretty much
unavoidable, for any list, site or system that doesn't censor. Consider
Freenet, for example. Or Tor onion sites.
The point is that you can filter the list however you like. Or subscribe
to a version of the list that's been filtered for you. Back in the 90s,
I subscribed to fcpunx back then, to avoid the worst of it. Someone
could do something similar now, but the volume is so low that it'd
hardly be worth it. Just filter in your mail client.

Yeah, that's a decent list. As I've understood it, however, "collapse of
governments" is the expected result, once the rest are effectively in
place. Eliminating a particular government through armed struggle has
typically led either to another government, or to a failed state. But if
you create the basis of functional anarchy, government is superfluous.

And the rest of the year could well be worse. As in global financial

civilization. AKA the Jackpot. Or at least, over the inflection point.
But hey, maybe I'll be dead (not just inside) so I won't care ;)

Yeah, I should have mentioned that. But hey, every cpunk knows that, no?
Some sort of collapse is a standard start for dystopian fiction. Decades
ago, it was typically global nuclear war. However, I do recall some SF
where it was toxic chemical pollution. Now it's often global climate
change. That's a huge piece of Gibson 's Jackpot. Along with pandemics
:\ It's also a key aspect of the back story in Watts' _Blindsight_ and
_Echopraxia_. But I don't recall that Watts has a name for it.
Well, the US dollar may soon be toast. Maybe down 20%-30% by 2021, and
might be replaced by a gold-backed greenback within a few years (if the
US can find enough gold, anyway). And/or cryptocurrencies ;)

OK, so what do you say is killing all those people?
And are you literally claiming that the virus doesn't exist, and that
there's a global conspiracy behind it all?
I don't know that I'd go that far. I do see the ecological benefit, of
course. And my Bitcoin and precious metals (physical) would be worth
more, relative to stuff. But then, maybe there'd be food shortages, no
electricity, and so on. Which would suck.
Yeah, I'd like to see that, in maybe 10-15 years. Because I'd be almost
dead then, and the "I told you so" rush would be sweet. But it would
suck if it happens before I'm ready to die.

Sure, COVID-19 is mainly killing older people. Looking at various online
sources, almost half of fatalities were over 75. About 25% were 65-74,
and about 22% were 45-64. Only about 5% were under 45. And yes, for all
age groups, most of the fatalities had underlying health conditions.
But most of those people arguably died sooner that they would have, but
for COVID-19. Maybe not a lot sooner, I admit. But in the most heavily
affected areas, total death rates _did_ increase.
Anyway, I do get the argument that it would have made more sense,
overall, to just let everyone get infected, and let all the old and
infirm just die. That would arguably have avoided the huge economic
shitstorm that we'll be facing for the rest of the decade.
And damn, if you welcome the shitstorm, why complain so loudly about the
proximate cause? Isn't it all for the lulz?

Well, it's a different type of virus. And it may well be one where
immunity after infection and recovery doesn't last very long, and where
vaccines won't work. If that's the case, it could be a fuckload worse
than another kind of flu. But ask me again next year this time.
It's too early to compare.
Compared to historical averages.
I do agree with that. And one aspect of "how the natural world works" is
that monocultures are vulnerable to decimation by pathogens. So COVID-19
is just a natural response to human overpopulation. And there's no
reason to think that there won't be more. The rate of zoonotic disease
outbreaks has increased about five fold in recent decades.
I do tend to agree with that.
Well, being so old, I'd rather not be surrounded by people infected with
COVID-19. And fortunately, I live in an area with very few of them.
Time will tell.
It does seem that way, doesn't it? Opportunism seems more likely than
conspiracy, but you could be right.
No comment.

There's ~zero doubt that pigs can't fly. But the length of immunity
after recovery from COVID-19 is clearly an open question. If for no
other reason than having just several months of data. And we won't
likely have a useful answer until 2022.
It's not a type of influenza. The common cold is generally caused
coronaviruses and rhinoviruses. So if anything, COVID-19 is basically a
bad cold ;)
likely that some populations are more susceptible than others, so it's
not as extreme as bananas (clones) or even typical agricultural crops.
Yeah, no doubt.
Again, it's not influenza. And about overpopulation, many do think that
we're close to the breaking point. But whatever, it's pointless to argue
about it on this list.
Indeed, that's one aspect. SARS and COVID-19 came from Chinese eating
bats. Ebola came from Africans eating bushmeat: bats (ebola) and
nonhuman primates (HIV). MERS came from camels in Saudi Arabia, and
perhaps originally from bats. So yeah, gotta watch out for bats.
I also isolate myself from the cesspool of popular culture :)
Yes, sadly enough.
I am a hardcore materialist, and I do consider the scientific method to
be the best approach for understanding stuff. I'd rather be a god than
worship one (or a goddess). So variation and selection are my deities.
That's for sure a serious issue. But that's about physicians, and they
are not at all scientists. They're more like witch doctors.

Sure, but "criminal" is such an ambivalent term. As they say, it depends
on whose ox is getting gored.
I generally agree, although I'm not so bloodthirsty about it ;)
As I see it, privacy rights are inversely proportional to power over
others. So even if governments are necessary, which is questionable at
best, nothing about them ought to be private. Because openness is a
prerequisite for public oversight. And because despotism is totally
inevitable without public oversight.

As I understand it, they charged him with facilitating illegal drug

equivalent of reckless driving.
They also charged him with some murder for hire bullshit, based on
entrapment by an undercover cop. But he wasn't convicted on that.
