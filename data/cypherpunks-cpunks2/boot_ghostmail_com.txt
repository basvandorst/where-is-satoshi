no no no this is all wrong..
If new york can decrypt, it means there is a backdoor
we know backdoors can be used by anyone who finds them.
this is bad not only for pplz but also for business, who will still trust us tech?
Thu Jan 14 2016 00:24:18 from John Young "New York can and should lead the nation in protecting its citizens, and
in responding to the misguided and dangerous attempts by digital device
manufacturers to turn digital devices into virtual safes that, being
beyond the reach of law enforcement, are havens for criminals. Revela-
tions in the recent past about NSA surveillance and similar government
intrusions on privacy have made people acutely aware of threats to their
privacy. The goal of this bill is not to limit peoples' privacy.
Peoples' privacy is protected by the warrant requirement, as it always
has been. This bill would help to protect all New Yorkers."
