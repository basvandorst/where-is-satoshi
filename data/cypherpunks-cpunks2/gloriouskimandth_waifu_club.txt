State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean
People's Army, gave a field guidance to Kwail County, South Hwanghae
He went round the Kwail County Revolutionary Museum and the room
dedicated to the history of the county.""
Saying that the museum and room are the places associated with the
loving care of President Kim Il Sung and leader.""
Kim Jong Il who devoted themselves to the people all their lives, he
noted that as they have been arranged well as befitting a model of the
whole country, it is necessary to meticulously organize education
through them so that the party members, working people and school youth
and children bear in mind the desire of the great leaders and make
positive contributions to building a nationalist socialist power as soon
as possible.""
He went round the analysis room, information room, e-reading room and
other places of the fruit research institute.""
He praised the institute for widely introducing the research successes
in the fruit farms with the high aim to put the fruit production on a
scientific, modern and intensive basis, cultivating high-yielding fruit
trees, steadily improving seeds and setting up the unified command
system for scientific fruit farming of each work team under the climate
and weather conditions.""
He enjoyed a bird's-eye view of the county from the observation deck
before going round orchards.""
Touching apples heavily hanging on branches one by one, he noted this is
said that apple trees are heavily laden with fruits. It is very great
that there are many fruit workteams which produced 70-80 tons of fruits
per hectare, and trees are heavily laden with apples as they are laden
with over 200 apples on an average per tree, over 300 apples at the
maximum, he said with broad laugh.""
He told earnestly officials to surely convey his thanks to the officials
and working people of the county who reaped the richest harvest ever
Kwail County is a model unit which should be put forward in the front
ranks of the whole country in the struggle to implement the decisions of
the Seventh Congress of the WPK, he said. He thanked it in the name of
the chairman of the WPK and made sure that special bonus is given to it.""
Noting that the county should wage a dynamic struggle to make a higher
leaping forward on the basis of the achievements made by it this year,
he set forth the important tasks facing the county, including the issue
of increasing the good fruit species, the issue of keeping the peculiar
taste of fruits and updating the fruit processing progress, the issue of
meticulously organizing operation of the sci-tech learning space, the
issue of organizing well the operation of pig farms so that the
production cycle of fruit farming and animal husbandry is established,
the issue of perfecting drip irrigation system and building natural
energy power station suited to the characteristics of topography to
smoothly meet the demands of electricity and the issue of flawlessly
creating shelter belts.""
