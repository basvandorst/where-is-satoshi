@_subject: Someone recommends the hacking TV series "Mr. Robot" 
As usual it's in the grey zone. The big corporation the characters are
fighting against is huge and can afford to cover up its mistakes without
any repercussions. The corporation is doing stupid/bad things and hackers
decided to stop that nonsense( you'll see what stop means if you watch the
series ) It's interesting how even my non-techy friends like it.
I can't recommend it enough but you have to see for yourself. Watch the
pilot episode at least.
I haven't watch it yet. "someone" agrees about the hacking techniques.
Might be wrong, but am sceptical that U$A would allow TV series
conveying anti-establishment/anti-bigcorp message (IMHO big TVs are
f.cked whores).
Without spoiling the plot of the series, do you find it "socially
correct" so far?

How's the situation in Turkey?
On Jul 24, 2016 2:01 PM, "Bastiani Fortress" turkey has been taking interest in such a complicated way (i don't know
how, exactly) that it claims they do not take interest and is halal to
attract fundematalist clients :D Islam in many ways does resemble
socialism, but it's still total bullshit in many other ways. (i say this as
an atheist, living in turkey btw)
Unfortunately, though, you are something, a stranger.

I've been lurking around this maillist for a long time but I haven't really
contributed with anything. I really like the discussions, arguments,
recommendations of the group. Very thought provoking. I'm looking forward
to participating a lot more in the conversations :)
If not the same, the manga Ouroboros is very similar to what Cecilia
Another manga recommendation is the the historical work of Sentarō Kubota -
Bokko ( translated as "Mohist attack" ) which narrates the story of a monk
from the clan that preaches Mohism.
