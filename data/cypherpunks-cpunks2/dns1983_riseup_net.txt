@_subject: temporary fix for disabled Firefox extensions 
Maybe this can help you. In my case I noticed that this fix works only on Firefox android. On Firefox for Gnu-Linux it works only with Firefox ESR. You can use the same profile with Firefox ESR without reinstalling all extensions. 
This is what Giorgio Maone, the author of No script, suggests.
