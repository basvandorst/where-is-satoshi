@_subject: Corrupt governments are inherently inept 
Corrupt governments are inherently inept, or at least appear so. There is a decisional overhead in maintaining the illusion of corruption or maintaining a certain level of BS that would avoid outraging people enough to take action. The complexity in decision making was partially what destroyed the Soviet Union, virtually all sectors of society was lying to each other to maintain an illusion and the ability of the central government to enforce their plans rapidly eroded.
The US government is extremely corrupt. Take Trump for instance, why would the media keep mentioning he is corrupt, and yet Congress does nothing about it? Congress is the most powerful branch of government, ignoring Congress’s capability to censure or remove their own members, a 2/3 vote would allow Congress to take any action for any reason, exemplified by the Supreme Court decision in Nixon vs. United States (a different Nixon oddly enough). Congress can impeach the entire Supreme Court on a whim, impeach the entire Executive Branch even.
So what does it say? Maybe Trump really is corrupt, he got rich from money laundering or so the media says. Where did the profits from Operation Fast and Furious go, to the ATF or to the gun runners themselves? (  ) I suppose only Congress has oversight over that matter. But the United States is rapidly crumbling, and US politics have become a circus. The whole thing is a distraction, clearly. Every major city has rising unemployment, with homeless people looking more and more able to work, even the city I live in is in debate about adding maybe several dozen units for housing the homeless (which says a lot about everyone’s sanity or the size of the local homeless population).
So. The US government can’t do anything about Trump? Just a bunch of leaks and exaggerated statements condemning Trump with no evidence? Even if the evidence had to be secret, Congress can’t be trusted with it? Or if Congress can be trusted with it, do they lack the spine to maintain a functioning and free society?
I wonder what happened to the ATF agents involved with violating federal law and smuggling cigarettes. Maybe they pulled a John Connolly, forged informant reports and accepted bribes. Or they used fake informants and forged the paperwork to pay off other officials. It certainly seems outrageous, it sounds like the whole ATF could be potentially corrupt, or just a few bad apples. But what does it say about the “good” people if they don’t notice what is happening around them when they are practically in the thick of it?

@_subject: Trial by ordeal in perpetuity 
Trial by ordeal is illegal, self-evidently so. Law enforcement has principally two means of catching an offender: being coy, and putting pressure on them.
Being coy only works on unstable egoists. I could allege I don’t have much of an ego, but the FBI proved in the USS Iowa turret explosion that they just rationalize the psychological reasoning for a theory that other law enforcement agencies give them.
Putting pressure on them depends on the type and nature of pressure placed upon them. I could say I am involved in something that is Mr Big scale, but involving welfare, but that sounds too absurd no one would believe me. Right now I’m 80% dependent on my parents so the situation will continue, unless I can actually achieve employment with a blank resume.
Ultimately though, I’d like to get on with my life.
Still absurd: this guy is acting like he has a bit of autism in the social situation, so he’s fairly silent or untalkative, lets bother him by insinuating one of the absurd crimes he is accused of that we never plan on charging him for.

The government has:
-spoofed communications from unaffiliated parties from which they can be no reasonable suspicion of them committing crimes.
-altered emails within my inbox.
-altered outgoing communications from my computer.
-alternatively borked or bricked household devices for no investigative purpose
-refuse to admit to an investigation while making me aware of the investigation for the sole purpose of harassing me
-made mocking communications to me through their informants, for which there can be no investigative purpose or which there can be no expectation that it would yield an actionable result
-cooperated with the LAPD to arrest me under false pretenses
-concealed the existence of the investigation for the sole purpose of preventing an actionable claim against their unconstitutional conduct
-is aware that the government’s conduct is so outrageous it would preclude prosecuting me, thus self-confirming there is no investigative purpose to the conduct
If the government admits to that, admits to the truth, it will all go away. Does the US government really intend to spend billions, tens of billions, hundreds of billions, to accomplish literally nothing?

Epstein was a victim of a blue collar conspiracy, all his employees, all the laborers at various airports [0], all his own bodyguards, they were all in on it. He was just a naive upstanding man who managed to previously get convicted for a sex crime. Billionaires are the gullible sort you see.
No one who met him will ever say they’ve seen any indication Epstein was an unhinged sex maniac, those sex toys just ended up in his bathroom, mysteriously. As well as the art he paid for. Maybe if there was evidence that he was some sort of cannibal or had some sort of dungeon full of sex slaves, that too just appeared mysteriously.
Naturally the US government is on the case. And these blue collar folks, they aren’t too smart, they may have tricked Epstein into hiring them and arranged everything to look like Epstein is a horrific monster, but the US government knows better. The Russians led them. The Russians led a multi-decade operation to frame Epstein as a sex criminal without the US government noticing until it was completed.
It would be quite the stunning operation, they may as well performed some sort of magic act stealing Fort Knox, but no one is as smart as the US government. So no one would expect that the US government would try to not act on any of the evidence.
Because this is what the US government does, it doesn’t do anything.

The above paragraph is incorrect, it is refuting an argument she has not made. The verbosity and vagueness would enable any opponent to focus on the part “it can’t be true”. So what is she arguing? Even that is unclear other than signaling she is vapid with no firmly well thought out beliefs.

It is possible to have an actionable claim against Virustotal if it was revealed that (this is something the government would obviously want):
1. It hid files with spoofed signatures from other vendors or even other users.
2. The file would be popularly defined as malicious.
3. The file would have a spoofed scan showing as fine.
It seems unlikely that any dll would be the first to be uploaded given that cheaper antivirus vendors use virustotal as the scanning engine (or false positive detection engine).
I think it would be minor news if the government does use malware in investigations, so obviously the government used it once against Tor and decided it wouldn't be viable for future investigations.
I am certain everyone trusts the government totally, because discovery is a long held legal issue of constitutional value, and so it isn't inherently corrupt to avoid discovery.

As far as I can tell by the government reenacting various accusations against me (which truly is cruel considering these are false accusations and that I had no involvement), the US government is putting more effort to stop a guy doing nothing, than an abusive woman who was let off, and currently has an interesting source of employment with the government (why employ a person that would reduce the government's reputation if this the goal, is the government not declaring that it is run by traitors?).
If this case was subject to public examination, the woman would have to be produced, and quickly the government would be shown to be totally incompetent. Or maybe sheep led by wolves.

There are apparently five organized crime families. No doubt the FBI is wiretapping them, but they can't seem to make any headway. The US government has more luck with intercepting low level drug runners, usually those they didn't have specific warrants on.
The cypherpunk philosophy can't make public knowledge any more public than it already is. The failure to act is a human failing, not a technological one.
The design of systems meant to prevent quick and secure options in a world where every corporation has been breached is human stupidity, clearly. The violation of expectations that online computer systems are authoritative sources of authentication should be more inviolable than it is, though the government may very well have a wanton disregard for social norms.
I wonder what would the US government do if there is extensive video evidence that the country's leaders are largely pedophiles. First they would assume the videos are fakes. There is still the issue that most of the videos are apparently unique compared previously seized or circulating materials.
Anyway, in ten years, there won't be a need for more than a total of 5 public IPs on the entire internet.

@_subject: [Repost] The innumerable connections that various nonprofit 
I should give some credit to leftist conspiracy twitter, but that might be
problematic. Still, the proof is not hard to find, which just makes it all
rather depressing.
Obviously connection number one is they still are nonprofits. People live
at the mercy of the state to a greater degree than they realize.
Connection number two is that Morris Ernst was J. Edgar Hoover's close
friend, or so he thought. Rather Hoover tasked an FBI agent to reply to
correspondence to him, so effectively Hoover had an informant within the
ACLU. There has been very little said on this topic.
Connection number three is that J.P. Barlow, founder of the EFF was
contacted by Robert Steele in 1992 (currently believes there is a child sex
slave colony on Mars) to speak at an intelligence conference.
it was pretty prescient "Nonetheless, I sallied forth, confidently telling
the gray throng that power lay not in concealing information but in
distributing it, that the Internet would endow small groups of zealots with
the capacity to wage credible assaults on nation-states, that young hackers
could easily run circles around old spies.")
Connection number four is that Morton Halperin negotiated with the CIA to
support the passage of Intelligence Identities Protection Act. Morton
Halperin was suspected of leaking that the US was bombing Cambodia,
although clearly we should've used drones then. Morton Halperin has served
a few roles with Open Society Institute.
Page 85 of Secrets: The CIA's War at Home (
These are not exceptional or new allegations.
The Electronic Frontier Foundation went to Washington to "reverse-engineer
government, hack politics down to its component parts, and fix it." Then it
helped pass the FBI's loathsome "let's-just-wiretap-everyone" Digital
Telephony Bill. And discovered it was Washington that had
reverse-engineered the EFF, driving it into dissension, debt, disgrace -
and right out of town. .
P.S. interesting in context to the times we live in

to cloudbleed
i have seen a lot of nonsensical explanations for various bugs and issues,
including that for those that I am a user of, but I do not think compelled
speech exists, so I don't know.
P.P.P.S. I am open to the possibility that there is a child sex slave
colony on Mars, but unlike that guy who stormed Comet Ping Pong, I can't
quite go over there to investigate. (fortunately the failed actor, Edgar
Maddison Welch, was not a black man, so he was not shot on sight, as would
be typically expected)
It does seem clear though that the world is set up to benefit people who
realize everything is rigged, and they could rise to a middle-management or
equivalent lofty position perpetuating everything. Challenging power is
difficult to impossible, one of major difficulties being that most people
are just plain dumb. I would prefer it if they proved otherwise and I would
prefer not being in the position I am in now. Anyone who thinks my position
is advantageous is free to trade places.

Woman commits numerous crimes, and certainly numerous acts which are an offense against society.
Woman is later threatened with perjury, takes immunity, names a man, makes slanderous allegations against him, and is exonerated (???).
US government investigators later go on to decide the best action, is to mount an investigation against that single man, devote millions of dollars of resources just to monitor him. Most evident motivation is to put pressure against the guy so that he may crack and do ... (???) to accomplish (???). Unclear if man is framed or somehow condoned the allegations against himself, although the latter is totally illogical?
Years pass, the investigation continues, they continue efforts, and insinuate the allegations against him (when they are self-evidently false). They also begin “flexing”, showing off that law enforcement interfaces have non-public features to (???) to accomplish (???).
Government admits to nothing. Situation reaches extreme ludicrousness. Somehow the investigation into this one man, that has accomplished nothing, that is unlikely to yield anything, who never met the woman in question, is prioritized over everything else, for no other reason than this is the only possible investigation that they could devote so much resources to over so long to dedicate to one person.

There are things are a difficult to imagine, one of them among others is receiving a college degree in criminal justice and not understanding it.
I don't know how much it is worth to go from a prosecutor to a defense attorney, but apparently it is worth the life of a person I had never met, but is something the government wants to remind me about from time to time because they've been assigned to my case and have nothing better to do.
A little over two years ago LAPD arrested me for protesting in front of their police station, I was shouting the "police are gangstalking me", to call the kettle black. Of course I was right out side the door so they stood me up, had me face the wall for half an hour to an hour, kept me in a cell for an half and hour to an hour, gave me back my shoes without laces, it was all BS, because they know they are harassing me.
Now, any reasonable civil libertarian, if they had any reasonable access to any timeline of this, would say the government is wrong, and this is extrajudicial harassment. The accusation doesn't even make sense in the first place.
Regardless, if this is the secret the government want to keep, all for the sake of my disatisfaction, I suggest they should do their work without pay henceforth, if they enjoy it so much.

It is counter-intuitive and counter-productive for someone who thinks the government engages in secrecy to have the government violate rights in a secret manner that cannot be contested because of legal complexity.
If the government engages in an action, it is popularly known, and it is popularly approved, it could be considered legitimate, but if it is done in secret, it may as well be mob rule.

People are convicted on metadata. If not that, than motive. If neither of those are present, physical evidence is nearly meaningless.
The legal process is meant to prevent not simply criminal corruption, but simpler forms, such as padding crime stats, or innate bias, both of which can be manipulated. To some degree, the founding fathers were aware of them, and so are judges. The entire legal system is crafted based upon multiple perspectives of how society functions, although it is quickly changing to one where the legal system is that of a perspective of he who receives orders.
I posited a question once to someone, "What if you were the Nazi?"
All I got was, "I don't understand."
"Where does responsibility end, the person who sets the policy, the person who writes the policy, the person who interprets the policy, the person who gives orders, the person who carries it out?"
All I could prove is I have potential and it is being stymied in some way.
How does one prove a counterfactual to people who just aren't hearing it?
Or to put it another way, how can millions of card carrying party members ever be wrong?

The possible PoC was provided to me via, in non-descript terminology, a file-sharing service where a number of people access files from various servers world wide. The service does track user agents and IP addresses, so it is not anonymous, and is obviously not meant to be. I received the PoC after requesting a multimedia file in exchange for the service's brownie points. I intuitively felt the source to be suspicious and opened the file through an atypical means and found it to be corrupted.
I am willing to sign an affidavit attesting to this in exchange for legal aid, and I believe sunlight is the best disinfectant.
Presumably other people have obtained the same file, unless the service was operating under legal coercion. Regardless, all elements of the matter would have to be published in open court if this was "legal" so whoever it is from, they have continued to stay hidden for unknown motives.

@_subject: Better cache replacement policy for CPU caches 
Based on available information, CPUs use least-recently used as a cache replacement algorithm. This is excessively deterministic and leads to numerous side channel attacks. I propose a new cache replacement policy that would fix and prevent some categories of AES software timing attacks noticed since 2005.
All cache lines in the L1 cache will have a bitfield dedicated to each thread. When a cache line is loaded or read, a bit is set for all hardware threads except for the one requesting the data. When replacing a cache line, the first cache line with an unset bit is replaced. This is done by incrementing through each cache line and inspecting the bitfield, if the bit is set, it will be unset, and then the next cache line is inspected.
This will prioritize replacing cache lines used by the current hardware thread over cache lines used by other threads.
In the worst case, a thread will end up loading data to the L2 cache before it can load data into the L1 cache.
I call it the Canadian replacement algorithm because they are known for excessive politeness. This can be considered an inversion of the second-chance algorithm.
I won't touch upon the issue of context switches and software threads.

Great question, I hold deference to your opinions due to your known legal troubles. Perhaps the fact you even dare email me even increases your worthiness.
I wonder if it is the same reason ECC checking is done in RAM instead of the processor. It seems incredibly unlikely that a sufficient number of altered bits would occur over the lifetime of the chip to result in incorrect data be returned. Afterall, non-ECC is fine (unless you use ZFS), and the probability of receiving a slightly different bit of data over HTTP used to be pretty high at  according to "When The CRC and TCP Checksum Disagree"
So RAM is not the most likely source of errors, and being able to correct errors at refresh is sort of strange given the cost in die area.

Which reminds me of a part in Pat Buchanan's "Nixon;s White House Wars", where allegedly the FBI was going around trying to get journalists to publish based on some information that wouldn't hold up in a defamation case.
“As early as January, 1964, King engaged in another, two-day drunken sex orgy in Washington, D.C. Many of those present engaged in sexual acts, natural as well as unnatural, for the entertainment of onlookers. When one of the females shied away from engaging in an unnatural act, King ... discussed how she was to be taught and initiated in this respect,” the document reads.
It is worth noting that recently, live on television, there was a woman who claimed to have been raped by Trump, who... decided to salivate at the concept of rape in general.
It is very difficult to point out anything, but I suspect Martin Luther King had initial difficulty finding people to join his orgies given the upright moral character of so many people in his circles.

If any government official who actually knows anything would try to explain away the MLK letter or even what is going on with Donald Trump, they would begin to indict themselves. "You see, we didn't have as many contacts with opposition research members before..."
Increasingly few government officials actually understand what is going on, and the people who do won't try to inform them. Can someone like John Schindler actually explain themselves, why the United States can not function at least on an open basis?
The quote "this evidence of non-corrupt motives weighs heavily" is as good as any. The US government openly lies, and refuses to sufficiently explain anything. How can you disprove a lie? If the government cannot lie, it will find proxies to slander on their behalf. And if you disprove the lie, the government will find some reason to avoid further discussion.
I do question why anyone would be employed by the US government, or at least the seedier departments. What do they say, most people don't understand Iran-Contra like we do, topics the public is prone to outrage over is not up to them, because this is how a neoliberal democracy works?
George Washington said factionalism invites foreign meddling. So in order to remove the product of foreign meddling, the US government is engaging in factionalism. Most congressmen anyway are up for auction, neocolonialism is just third world nations bidding to be colonized.

First the government harassed me and claimed it wasn't happening, going so far as to put me into the strange mid-ground between a mental health hold and arresting me.
Then they claim that... what? It was an elaborate long term plan? I outright say the government is harassing me... and they are. And the government is lying about it.
The government likes to brag it has capabilities, but the problem is that they hire stupid people. You have to be stupid not to see the US as corrupt, while having access to all that they do.
The government is trying to outsmart me. It has immense resources, and it is failing horribly, even though I am just one person, systematically isolated (no incriminating metadata though, right?), and is failing. Every time.
And I can say this because the government brags that it is doing it, so they have to create a parallel investigation every few months to find something new to pin on me. And then I ruin the parallel investigation because apparently only a genius can understand that "any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex...".
I demand my own freedom. The government says no. The stakes are too stupid for this to continue, and yet it does.
The government is able to lie, yes. The government is self-aware that some actions are unpopular yes. The government believes it is executing the will of the people. Um.
To quote a previous email from me: On a side note, what is the legal culpability of someone who wasn't on the radar of an investigation, is alleged to be involved by a third party already admittedly unreliable due to lies, as a result, the first party faces the full brunt of an investigation for a decade while the third party goes off scott free? This is one of self-evident impropriety things.
What was the motivation for focusing immense resources on me? Because some psychologist in the Behavioral Analysis Unit thought I was most likely to crack? I wasn't involved. The government made me involved. There is no metadata. I demand the government to disclose the facts. The government believes it is representative, and so it conceals the truth.
And so I post this, yet the government has no real reaction?
I think I should go further, the government is intimidated, and so it must engage in secrecy.

@_subject: No one is obligated to participate in the investigation against me 
It is to my understanding that if I were to ask for technical advice on a web forum under a different username, people would be made aware of my identity by government investigators monitoring me. Which is not ordinarily a problem, but considering I was framed about a decade ago, it is.
I ask everyone, politely, to not participate. If the investigation was valid, the government would be doing things that pass the smell test. It doesn’t make sense for the government to be doing this for so long, and the government is behaving as if they are hiding something.
There is the question of what the government does when I go interact with an online community of people who wouldn’t know about me. The solution to that is simple, for Steam, the US government simply pretends to be the person on the other side of the screen.
The government right now is trying parallel construct an entire investigation and is failing because I keep associating one investigation with the other.
This is ludicrous, I don’t know how anyone can say the government is engaging in legal conduct with a straight face when the government’s behavior is absolutely unnecessary and seems to hinder whatever their self-stated objectives are.

@_subject: The One Argument 
I found the  website unconvincing. There is only one argument that can be made against any genuinely oppressive institution (funny how examinations into the why in history has never lead to any workable suggestions other than don't do it again).
So here is the one argument: If the principles or ideals that your institution represents are legitimate, why is there excessive secrecy, or does your institution only believe loyal individuals can understand their policies or goals?
On a side note, what is the legal culpability of someone who wasn't on the radar of an investigation, is alleged to be involved by a third party already admittedly unreliable due to lies, as a result, the first party faces the full brunt of an investigation for a decade while the third party goes off scott free? This is one of self-evident impropriety things.

@_subject: JFK Stole the Election 
"FBI agents who had placed wire taps on key Daley lieutenants (for entirely unrelated purposes) also had reason to believe that Illinois was rigged."
The FBI had:
1. Evidence that the election was stolen.
2. Decided to do nothing about it.
Why? How much crime does the FBI observe, and do nothing about, and thus in a sense, authorize and permit to occur? If you do not remove people who abuse their positions to engage in criminal acts, in effect you end up with a Praetorian Guard.
Is this necessarily a new phenomena?
I wonder what unrelated purposes those Daley wiretaps were for.

The government is made of institutions. The press is an institution.
The government makes the law, but it doesn't do so in a commonly acknowledged fashion, it does so by prejudicing the result, if the law is weak in an area. This is how new laws are passed, this is how old laws are reinterpreted.
Usually the press frames a situation as a moral issue, and either juries would see it as such, or legislators would.
Perhaps the average Trump supporter doesn't understand why they support Trump, nor does the average Democrat, but one thing is clear, if the allegations against Trump are true, they would vote out the entire government. There is a certain ridiculousness to it all. The press is publishing leaks on tangentially related items to the Trump investigation, the Trump investigation seems political motivated because they haven't charged anyone with what Republicans would see as valid crimes, but even if it was focused.... Hyperbole like "hack the election", "Alfa bank data laundering", if true, would be incredible.
This seems to be a systematic mishandling and inability to actually prosecute competently. If the honest truth was released, people would see it for what it is, not even a circus, but a clownshow.

To clarify, the worst injury that could occur if a prosecutor pursues a weak case is having a worse percentage win rate when he decides to talk up private practice.
The idea that a prosecutor's self-gain overrides other considerations is heretical, but in terms of cause and effect, an unrelated party can be faulted for a prosecutor's timidity, and for the prosecutor's notion that they are representing the victims to whom they've so utterly lied to.

@_subject: Superior Method to Branch Prediction in Security Properties 
Essentially the method is this: cache and store the variable that is necessary for the branch.
There are three possible ways to do it:
1. Detect if there's a loop and use the equivalent of a lock micro-op to ensure the variable essential to the branch condition doesn't leave the cache until a context switch or if the loop is detected to have completed.
2. Rewrite the loop in micro-ops to have a smaller variable for the branch condition, and end the loop when completed.
3. Convert the branch prediction unit to another set of registers and have it operate as a cache for branching variables.

Dark Mission does go over it in a sane way.
The idea that the government would disseminate ideas that are false is problematic for a free society, many times ideas that would go against the government's interests are presented in a way to avoid public acknowledgement.
The interesting thing about US spooks is their praise for Mossad. Keep in mind that Mossad's actual behavior seems to indicate that for whatever reason they don't care about the Holocaust. I must acknowledge the important role that the Simon Wiesenthal Center had in tracking Mengele.
For the US, naturally of course the first step of the denazification process is to put an actual Nazi in charge of German intelligence, which is something the Israeli lobby obviously approves of, and maybe even endorses.
An interesting problem with the hard headed is that they will ignore obvious counterarguments, but for complex matters, they'll provide pithy statements. Not sure what anyone can do about that beyond:
I'm sure the federal employees tracking Al Qaeda in the US at the time of 9/11 were relieved that their jobs weren't jeopardized because it had to be kept secret for a good reason. Whew, whew...
Glad that's over with, I guess we can get on with our lives now.

This NY Times article focuses entirely on local opinions about Liberal Studies. It makes no comparative analysis, or even examination of what Liberal Studies is.
Presumably it is similar to civics classes in the west. Critical thinking is encouraged in class.
I have no idea why critical thinking would be valuable in society.

That may be so. Certain Nazi sterilization programs required a court order. The most horrific acts can be cloaked with a clever argument. I make no such clever argument, but democracies are founded on persuasion, hence the ballot box and the jury box. Society must function in spite of errors, perfection is the enemy of good, etc.
As long as policies fulfill a commonly agreed upon objective, is this not democracy in action?

Could a nation’s leadership be immune to extortion by sheer stupidity?
Telling someone to take a negative action, and watch them be in total disbelief that the negative action occurred is unusual.
Telling someone to take a positive action to stop a harmful activity that it is their job to stop is something to disbelieve.
This is naturally a country where if you don’t count and buy a little baggie, that’s a felony, but you can sell major decisions for little kiddies.

Right now the US government is talking to the Russian government. The US team is full of people who believe in anti-colonialism. After encountering what must be thousands of hours of deep fakes, they have decided to produce amateur filmmaker quality fake videos in order to show the Russians the US knows how to do things better. And actually release the videos to the public because foreigners must think Westerners are some sort of robots with no discretion.

Somehow I suspect the FBI would never expect anyone to take them up on the offer to contact them regarding Epstein “If you have been victimized in any way or if you are somebody who has any additional information about his alleged illegal behavior, we want to hear from you.” A man long accused of sex crimes (by groundless accusations from their perspective) has victims coming forward after they ask for victims to come forward.
It makes me wonder how well they understand their jobs after I received the blame for the actions of someone unrelated to me.
They would receive all their answers and unravel dozens of cults operating throughout the west if the news mentioned, even briefly, that “it is possible to manipulate hallucinogenic visions of otherworldly beings...”
Independent of whether or not it is true, it would be a Wizard of Oz moment for at least some people, maybe even for members of the NXIUM cult.
The idea that a scientific investigation would attempt to test hypotheses in the least intrusive way possible could be unfathomable.

“Dictators ride to and fro upon tigers which they dare not dismount.” Beyond it being strange that anyone would mount a tiger, there is no doubt a long persistent special interest group disagreeing with the centuries old prohibition of gladiatorial games.

V8 uses a linear PRNG, depending on the precision of system time fed, V8 is vulnerable to the same attacks PHP was regarding a weak seed: it could be derived through a brute force search or by reversing the outputs.
Given that now that time stamps in browsers use reduced precision, it could be argued that using math.random, V8 is still vulnerable to spectre
Never mind that this bug report was closed as working as intended long ago: Personally I think a reduced round cryptographic function in OFB or something similar would be best.
