I have no idea what this is about beyond what you say below, but off hand, you have libeled everyone else on this mailing list by the statement in the subject of these messages:
"Your errors about me in your book."  I can assure you that I made no errors about you in my book.  Rather than the apparent royal you, perhaps you could be more specific and careful next time.
Good day sir.

This could be as simple as a wifi router that runs independent DHCP/XMPP/BitTorrent/etc., coordinated direct connections for file sharing/serving (SparkleShare, i.e. git over SSH), etc.
Or it could include peer-to-peer client wifi connections.  Or the router devices and/or portable devices could form meshes to get extended range and more of an internet/Internet.
The simple case isn't hard.  I've been thinking of doing the same thing for Burning Man: Resilient, mesh, usually disconnected, store and forward when disconnected, secure + public, fair, prioritized traffic, opportunistic but bulk Internet capable networking in harsh environments and random usage patterns.  Add store and forward to an XMPP server, plus email, some file transfer and usenet like flood propagation (using bittorrent protocols/methods), and you'd have a nice independent communication network.
Layer authentication / crypto, features, and applications as desired.

1) Be the enlightened humanist humans holding the wolves at bay. It's great we can generate the most badass attack / defense military and police, but they have to have boundaries and limits.  Compared to various historical precedents, they are effective and aren't terrible overall, but they do not live up to the ideals that are appropriate now.
2) Uplift the sheep.  The elites are failing the sheep, which isn't good for anyone.  We've left it to those who have the responsibility, but many of them are sheep too: shallow functionaries happy enough with the status quo and too scared to fail worse to tinker.
Elites (of a certain range: educated, makers, hackers, thinkers, freethinkers) have the power to change the world.  That includes some who are now considered with the wolves in various senses.  A few smart people changed civil rights, etc.  Don't assume that everyone who is part of the system agrees with it.  People are far more pragmatic than that.  Which generally includes not breaking laws, but can include transparency, dialog, and moving toward improvement.
The greater population have the power to swarm the wolves in various ways, if only they were knowledgeable, motivated, enabled, and led. Some progress has been made, and there are plenty of chinks visible now.  The trick is informing, directing, and/or leading that potential energy through a transformative path that is not more destructive than what you're trying to cure.
Sometimes it means letting groups make fools of themselves long enough for everyone to get tired and aware enough to shun them for long periods after.  The end result of the "moral majority" minority and religious / public power grab and related surge for social freedom/sexual oppression was: free and open porn, negating of nearly all sexual blue laws, momentum for same-sex civil rights, nearly complete change of attitudes, dissipation of religion-in-government and general defeat of religious fundamentalists, an educated liberal probably-atheist black president, etc.  They spent money and time defeating themselves, permanently, and they don't even know why it happened. Sociopolitical judo.  On the other hand, for a long time Rove et al were frequently successful reframing things with clever rebranding of terms: "death taxes" etc.

@_subject: the Great Filter of private communication 
Probably people just need two email clients: One for non-secure email, another that only sends secure messages.  They can both use imap for the same account.  Bonus: spam might potentially have a hard time getting accepted as a secure sender, leaving secure email spam free.
Alternately, do it on viewing / editing via plugins that are less invasive and more secure.
There are several problems:
Choosing an ID system: email address + key ID of some kind.
Key exchange / trust system: Hierarchical (do you trust some or all CAs?  Their signup policies?), web of trust (GPG or similar), personal signing, etc.
Visibility and understanding: Current systems are annoying even for experts.  No hope of a normal user looking at or understanding ID/cert/key trust situation.  Make it specific and simple: CA is safe but could be coopted by TLA or mistakes, signup was weak (could have been a stolen credit card), password could have been stolen, mitm exposure, etc.  Just draw the trust / exploit tree. Factor in multi-factor, alternate channel checking, etc.
Ease of selecting, enabling, and using read/write interfaces.
Solve the problems of control, time available, ability to save for later safely.

@_subject: Lois Lerner's conveeeeeeeeeeniently-lost emails. 
I assume she was using Outlook and probably Exchange.  Does anyone using Outlook really expect to be able to reliably have access to their old email very long?  I think "those people" are idiots...  I'd guess that Outlook / Exchange versioning issues, curruption, periodic rebuilds / restarts, and general Windows / Microsoft related confusion led periodic lossage that is just the cost of using such technology.
I have a continuous archive of email spanning more than 20 years, and something like 25-30GB, online and always accessible to me. And with numerous backups, all easy to make and restore.  And all using mbox format, around since essentially the beginning of email, which is resilient to corruption, truncation, etc.
In multiple cases, at multiple companies, people have needed access to old email and documents which I had but were long ago lost to everyone else (who mostly used Outlook).  In one case, it allowed a new contract worth probably more than a million or two.
Email is my most reliable source of stored and organized knowledge.  I've been hard at work, in my fragmented spare time, working on a true knowledgebase app / interchange format / distributed security system.  (The key problem really is a much better user interface paradigm.)  You can bet there will be a couple ways to represent and archive it that is as resilient as mbox.

Not really the same at all.  Russia's government is still actively oppressing people in these ways while the US is:
A) Far less homophobic and racist than it used to be.  In some areas, hardly at all.
B) Has gone from the government homophobia hunting people to fire from government jobs in the 1950's to complete legality and usually legal protection now.
C) The Millennials as a group are not homophobic or racist to any measurable degree.  Remaining pockets are becoming more isolated and their youth are changing too, as far as anyone can tell.
The whole culture is rapidly changing in many ways.  Music, Internet, Hollywood, legal cases, politicians (because many have been voted out), etc. have all been changing people's opinions.  The rate of evolution, or at least the rate of maturation of active cycles has been apparently increasing each year.
Pervasive cell phone video, major cases of corruption and overstepping bounds and tragedy have caused major pull back of longstanding troublesome trends.
This is how all of this ties into cypherpunks:  Observing how opinions, public sentiment, then enforcement, regulations, and market options evolve in each of these cycles should be instructive when trying to induce important change.  How can you position things to improve better outcomes when inflection points happen?

@_subject: Warrant Canaries 
The point of a warrant canary is to communicate in a legal way something that is illegal for you to communicate directly.  That involves something like setting laws against each other in some prioritized way or otherwise splitting hairs so that no one can technically be prosecuted.  It is a bit of a legal arms race.
You have to find something you cannot be compelled to do or not do. A dead man's switch of some kind where not doing something is ambiguous and unassailable.  Can you be required by law to go to Starbucks every morning?  To report or not report on Facebook something factual, like you ate Wheaties that morning?  You have a headache?  Something that is protected by a higher priority law, although if the First Amendment is trumped by these laws that's going to be difficult.  Perhaps a group of people probabilistically do or not do something, but any evidence of collusion would be a problem so they would have to act independently.  Some mechanism that relies on someone's thoughts might be sacrosanct.  Visual dwell, polygraph (not that they work at all), etc.
Perhaps every day someone proposes that the warrant canary has triggered, and every day but one someone objects.
Is there or is there not a way to do this legally?  That seems like a gray area, if the First Amendment is trumped, along with other legal protections that could apply.
If there is no way to do this legally, what are the ways to dilute the situation as to be effectively legal, i.e. prosecution would be unlikely or ineffective?
Since the First Amendment is strained here, reasonable people could conclude that the conflicting law is unconstitutional.  That could lead to a sense of responsibility to do the right thing.

If you are inside the US, you do have full protection of US laws, including the First Amendment, although there are some specific exceptions.  Outside the US, it varies.  Ideally, a local law provides similar protection.  US companies will operate as if you do have the same rights, so in some sense and range of situations, the rights extend to everyone globally.

If you are inside the US, you do have full protection of US laws, including the First Amendment, although there are some specific exceptions.  Outside the US, it varies.  Ideally, a local law provides similar protection.  US companies will operate as if you do have the same rights, so in some sense and range of situations, the rights extend to everyone globally.

The point of a warrant canary is to communicate in a legal way something that is illegal for you to communicate directly.  That involves something like setting laws against each other in some prioritized way or otherwise splitting hairs so that no one can technically be prosecuted.  It is a bit of a legal arms race.
You have to find something you cannot be compelled to do or not do. A dead man's switch of some kind where not doing something is ambiguous and unassailable.  Can you be required by law to go to Starbucks every morning?  To report or not report on Facebook something factual, like you ate Wheaties that morning?  You have a headache?  Something that is protected by a higher priority law, although if the First Amendment is trumped by these laws that's going to be difficult.  Perhaps a group of people probabilistically do or not do something, but any evidence of collusion would be a problem so they would have to act independently.  Some mechanism that relies on someone's thoughts might be sacrosanct.  Visual dwell, polygraph (not that they work at all), etc.
Perhaps every day someone proposes that the warrant canary has triggered, and every day but one someone objects.
Is there or is there not a way to do this legally?  That seems like a gray area, if the First Amendment is trumped, along with other legal protections that could apply.
If there is no way to do this legally, what are the ways to dilute the situation as to be effectively legal, i.e. prosecution would be unlikely or ineffective?
Since the First Amendment is strained here, reasonable people could conclude that the conflicting law is unconstitutional.  That could lead to a sense of responsibility to do the right thing.

Everything will be run in the cloud and browser because it is, overall, a better computation model. However, that doesn't preclude you from running a cloud locally. Although pretty much proprietary to Google & Amazon until recently, Docker et al and related VM/container management APIs that are mappable to all kinds of implementations will allow apps, administration, networking, etc. to be fluid between commercial and various types of private clouds.
In a lot of ways, this is an elegant solution and could arguably be much more secure than desktop apps in Windows.  Assuming your container system isn't running in Windows, which is becoming an option; one that I won't trust easily.

The browser provides a super feature / security / quality / portable baseline that is rapidly improving.  Only a few alternatives come close and they all fall short in major ways: Qt (which greatly relies on browser tech now), Java & C Unity, UnReal, etc. Certain things are still better in those alternatives, but less and less.  With Javascript optimization, ASM.js, SIMD.js, WebGL, etc., browsers have, for most purposes, resolved the computational gap while having massively better security stance.  WebComponents, the new binary Javascript format, along with WebRTC, WebUSB, and other features, we're getting the cleanest app and platform model we've seen so far.
The key architectural questions about remote communication involve security, efficiency, stability, portability, etc.  While it isn't perfect, web tech provides a nice enough model for expressing the highest level logical communication needed in secure (enough for most purposes), flexible, efficient enough, and low latency enough for most purposes ways.  Solutions like Swagger, Go, and other modern techniques are much cleaner and simpler than previous clunky solutions.
Most of the most interesting web apps now run almost completely in the browser.  The server side sends the original page and code, manages authentication, then acts mostly as a database with minimal logic.  As long as the API doesn't rely solely on client-side validation and other things that could be gamed, it can still be secure.  Because it's now easy to run the same code on the front and back, complex validation could be done on the front-end for low latency and the backend for actual security, for instance.
There are plenty of things that could be better and will get better, but regardless the power & ease gap between web app development, for most situations, is only increasing.  Emulating any substantial subset of browser-level UI and other features in a non-browser desktop app is nearly impossible now.

Sharing all of your secrets, then prosecuting adversaries that make ill use of it, in court and the court of public opinion, is a valid path.  Better, throw in some misinformation so that they are mislead in self-sabotaging ways.
If you are speaking on a line that you know is being recorded by "authorities", what should you be talking about?  In the US at least, perhaps something that would make listeners blush or spend time chasing phantoms or something.  Might as well get your money's worth.  At some point I realized that I should just go to court for every ticket or other opportunity.  If the alternative is that you certainly have to pay, then you might as well learn, get comfortable protecting yourself in court, say your peace, and try whatever legal argument you can think of.  I have about a 50% win rate.
Interesting how certain companies, Apple, feel they need to be totally opaque while others, Google and others, are closer to being mostly open.  Space-X and/or Tesla are giving away free use of some patents, a somewhat related example.

"Stolen code" isn't really an issue most of the time, but can be legally if a lot is used in a way that conflicts with a license. Reusing code snippets is, to a large extent, not really a copyright issue and often fair use or use of something that isn't really protected by copyright.  In any case, it is a legal issue separate from the security implications.
The FUD in question is whether there are security problems of some kind lurking in code, and whether it is easier to compromise a binary when you have source to start with.  The flip side is that it is easier to hide back doors in code that has limited access to source code.  Security mistakes, deliberate malware, and detection are possible in both cases, but in different ways, with different numbers of actual or potential people looking and with different likelihood of active positive or negative collusion.

Valid concerns in the abstract.  In practice, the economic concerns of big cloud providers means they must provide continually upgraded certainty of fundamental security separation.  Part of that is randomness of where your code runs: If there are millions of VMs on hundreds of thousands of physical servers, even if there is a VM escape, it is essentially impractical for malware to target your instance.  This could be enhanced by VM / container hopping in various senses.  Working within the system is likely to provide you a stronger result than something cobbled together locally.
However, we need solutions for that too, with and without cloud technology.  We need people who don't trust the cloud and keep developing better alternatives.  I think some of those alternatives involve cloud technology locally, but that's not a big thing.
I have friends who are rabid Google haters / fearmongers, apparently based on the fact that it was the first company they were aware of that seemed to have access and responsibility for too much information, or too much of their information, or too strong an allure for their information.  I feel perfectly confident that Google is going to protect their billions in income and valuation by being very careful with avoiding abusing their data or users in any strong sense.  That might not withstand a court order or national security letter or TLA hack monitoring unencrypted links, although big Silicon Valley companies recently have been getting tougher there.  But it certainly means they aren't "reading my email" for prurient or invasive purposes that would be embarrassing to me: It would become embarrassing to them quickly and cost millions or billions.

Perfectly within the realm of the possible.  A lone employee may be able to abuse things, but they likely will be caught, fired, and the incident has some chance of being righted and paid off.  Unlikely to actually be the case in any pervasive way.  Nearly all conspiracies leak eventually.  Being a commercial company, they are a huge target for a jackpot payday.  TLAs have no such worry, which is why when they do illegal things and otherwise drift or charge outside the boundaries that it is so bad.  A few years ago, before Congress stepped in to let them off the hook, phone companies like ATT were in a tight spot for allowing a lot of open access to customer data. I'm sure that legal departments everywhere took notice of that exposure; Congress isn't going to do that too many more times, and especially not for commercial gain.
Parallel construction is a big problem, although I think that it has been exposed in some major cases lately that should soften courts for detecting and confronting it.  It's possible both for prosecutors, TLAs, and companies wanting to steal proprietary trade secrets.  Perhaps practical and legal techniques used to combat insider trading may start to provide some protection.  It is at least possible to take countermeasures to expose parallel construction: information that provides ways of detecting eavesdropping is an obvious solution.
It is certainly the case that we should consider the possible, especially since there have been a number of surprises about how far things actually did go in the past, especially the TLAs, but also sometimes with companies with really bad culture.  But that red team gaming shouldn't spill over too much into our rational assessment of actual risks and reasonable countermeasures.  There is a typical problem I call the Fallacy of Insisting on Zero Risk: A mother fearing their children using the bathroom at the mall alone or calling the police because someone else's child walks to the park alone while thinking nothing of horse riding or football or rodeo or smoking.  Or OSHA related spending millions per death to prevent one type of injury while ignoring other much lower hanging injury risks.  Gun control, vaccines, playground equipment, etc. often involve similar elements.  When making actual concrete security choices, a rational actor considers the threat, opportunity, costs, rewards, exposure, overhead, etc. when weighing what measures are worth taking.
In a presentation to the Nevada Gaming Commission years ago, I used the analogy of protecting nuclear weapons: The cost of a compromise is nearly infinite, so the amount you would be willing to rationally invest to prevent a compromise also can be nearly infinite.  (But apparently not given recent events related to those crews.) Everything else falls in a lower tier where there is a cost / benefit tradeoff.  You can go far enough in taking measures that you are worse off than if you had been compromised in the worst probable way.  The question there was how much certainty was needed that an Internet gambler was of age.  We went through a similar thing related to porn: Early on, many jurisdictions insisted on absolute certainty that a remote viewer was of age, or a company-ending lawsuit or criminal case would result.  Now, porn is essentially wide open, with at most proof of control of a credit card required to verify age; easily bypassed by a determined teenager, who could legally have a Visa debit card anyway.  For one thing, most of the supposed damage (Meese report etc.) was bogus, so few controls are really called for.
Now, many of us here want to be able to protect ourselves and others out of principle, need, career, and/or interest.  We may find it fun and career worthy to have TLA / scammer / evil genius defeating countermeasures and tradecraft.  We may get to the point we actually need it, or work with clients who definitely do.  But we shouldn't slip into unnecessary paranoia, especially if it gets to the point of shooting ourselves in the foot.  When we're making an argument, we are often taking the paranoid view because that's required to get into the right mindset.  After determining how to prevent issues, we should then decide what is actually worth putting into place.
I've run my own physical Internet server, including my own DNS servers, since 1992 when I obtained my first domain name and started a couple ISPs.  For various reasons, I will continue to do that, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to others, especially the non-technical.  My uptime, currently at 267 days, is basically the lifetime of the hard drive or the rare case when the colo moves things around.

Traditional corporate onsite compute, storage, network, security, software (Oracle etc.) is almost always extremely expensive.  While a raw hard drive may be inexpensive, if you buy it in an EMC or mainframe storage array, you are going to pay many multiples more per GB, compute minute, etc.  And, if you bought anything more than you actually use, you're being very wasteful.  Parts of the cloud revolution are rapid just in time purchase, deployment, change, new scalable methods, etc., but economically, it is often tremendously less expensive than a commercial solution plus the support staff to make it work.  In the most efficient traditional local deployment possible, this may not be true initially, but for the vast majority of mediocre corporate IT departments, it is very true.
If you are large and/or savvy enough, the thing to do is to borrow cloud system methods and run a cloud for yourself.  Currently, that's not completely easy or turnkey.  At some point, we should get to a clean utility computing model, but it will take a few more generations of evolution.

It's 10x for the drive, another 10x for the box to put it in, another 10x for a license for the software to get to it, ... (Roughly. ;-) )  You can be nickle and dimed up front or over time. In the latter case, it will continue to get more competitive and begin to have local systems with the same characteristics.
How much does an additional 4TB of storage for a z13 cost?
Most cloud systems fall into the embarrassingly parallel category. Many smaller, cheaper, cooler units completely outclass, in price and scalability, bigger, faster, higher bandwidth solutions, unless those are built inexpensively with smaller, cheaper, cooler units. We're finding out whether medium sized (Intel/AMD desktop / server class CPUs) or small (ARM mobile chipsets) are going to scale better, but either way, a many node system has an aggregate memory bandwidth that dwarfs old-style mega CPU systems.  It's not clear, but it appears that the z13 is just an integrated cloud-style clustered system with a bunch of nice added features[2].  If so, which is the only way it could compete on scale and cost, it is a branded cloud system.  Would it really be less expensive to operate than an Open Compute local cloud?  Probably only if you made a lot of assumptions about overhead, etc.
The z13 looks cool, and has a lot of interesting features.  It will be interesting to see how it does.
If you have the type of business where you know what you need and how much of it you need, you can competitively provision a local solution, although there are still plenty of ways to go wrong.  And many do, IMHO.  Many businesses have relatively modest needs, don't know what their growth will look like, etc.  Large up front costs are bad in a lot of situations, as is committing to a certain scale when there is a lot of uncertainty.
The number of businesses and organizations who fit that narrow situation are few and dwindling.  Sales will be able to rope in plenty more for a while, but for many it is not a sane choice. Security breaks are mostly about passwords, trojans, spear phishing, zombie machines, etc.  For every possible exploit of a cloud system, which at the infrastructure level should have well-funded security, I feel there are many more gaps in the typical local alternative: Sloppy, old Windows systems with a sloppy network, open to everyone file servers, poor access control, terrible custom programming, no significant physical security, etc.  The best systems + networks + policies + personnel are more secure, everyone else is just lucky not to be targeted.
This covers some of this territory:

I hold multitudes.  I am in one thread totally cypherpunk, and have been for a very long time.  There are innumerable ways to compromise and be compromised for all kinds of good and mostly bad reasons.  Perfect protection is tough for in many ways and we should keep striving to get closer to that ideal security stance.
On the other hand, life is a balance.  I probably shouldn't have tried to make the point here, but it is something a security professional should understand well: The right amount of security should be moderated by the tradeoff of costs vs. overhead vs. maximizing benefit vs. minimizing loss.  Security stances change over time and aren't necessarily accurately reflected by paranoid An example along these lines that I like to keep in mind:
(I really did avoid writing down passwords anywhere for a long time.  And I still don't carry them with me.  If I did, they wouldn't be plaintext.)
It is terrible that some companies have been too eager to share information.  They may or may not have believed whatever safeguards were in place, or not cared, etc.  I'm sure a high pressure meeting with an FBI crew who are strongly playing the terrorism angle is persuasive, as it should be, up to a point. And companies holding your data can actually look at that data for business purposes, although how they use it is somewhat bounded by privacy laws (however incomplete), not making private things public, unfair business practices, etc.  My point was that the existence of large, valuable services that depend on a lot of trust is, or should be to a sane entity, an even stronger incentive to behave than the patchwork of laws.  Past oversharing, then embarrassment and public abuse, coupled with product impacts as they lose sensitive customers, has almost certainly caused a cleanup of those attitudes.  I'd be interested in the actual policy right now, although I doubt they are going to be too explicit.  I suspect that it also varies heavily by corporate culture.
Every day, you are somewhat at the mercy of dozens and perhaps thousands of people who could cause you pain, suffering, or death if they were so inclined.  There are many in the government, schools, employer personnel departments, medical and insurance companies, etc.  The people driving around you, stopped at a light while you cross the street, making your food, they all have access and the ability to inflict misery on you.  You have to trust someone to some extent.  The question is who you trust, how incentivized they and the people / organization around them protects you, whether wrongs will be limited, corrected, and righted or not.
For a long time, as a contractor at the peak of their heyday, I had access to AOL's entire user database, complete with name, address, full credit card info, phone numbers, etc.  I could have also snooped on their Buddylists, their person-to-person video (Instant Images), and a lot more.  There was zero chance that I would abuse any of that.

You're making an unqualified assumption about my unqualified qualifier "up to a point"...
Feel free.  I totally mock and rail about it too.  I can see several sides to this, and I've been on enough "sides" of these problems, at least in some weak sense, to have some model of decision making by people in those roles.  Poor decisions are understandable until there are enough cases, noticed and confronted, to make the right path clear.  We're getting a lot of those lately.  EFF, SPLC, ACLU, and others, sometimes including commercial entities, are providing an invaluable service of evolving both the law and internal commercial and government policy.
Hacking the system cleverly and deliberately is one of the cooler forms of hacking.
A few quibbles: for-profit is sociopathic-by-default perhaps, although even there you are assuming some socioeconomic system. You're also glossing over whether and when consent is an issue. People in public places sometimes believe that others need consent to take their picture; generally not true.  Is it rude to take your picture and does rudeness matter?  That depends.  "Beyond your expectations" is also problematic: How could any possible expectation ever be said to be adhered to?  Perhaps "generally accepted fair use as defined by EFF" or something (if there is such a thing) might be reasonable.  What is the definition of "many people"?
If you use language that can never be satisfied in any reliable way, you can't really complain that an entity isn't satisfying it.
Education is always good.  Don't infect others with pathological paranoia, but a healthy understanding of risks and exposures is always good.
Not inherently.  Social, economic, legal, contractual, and other cultural systems allow, disallow, guide, and control people in their interactions.  The US, for instance, has always been a place where there were many unwritten rules of operating in business.  Some have run roughshod over those, sometimes reaping unjust rewards and/or changing what is acceptable, but there are always things that could be done that just aren't.  Further, a particular entity could impose upon itself, by charter, culture, or customer agreement, a more stringent stance than others.  There could be mechanisms that audit or otherwise control this.
You get what you optimize for.  If you have a default corporation controlled by weak, shallow leaders and driven by shallow, blind Wall Street numbers, then the result is likely to be sociopathic. On the other hand, however imperfectly or incompletely, certain companies have a founder-driven culture of a far more empathic nature than this default, whether they be different or have a stated desire to not be evil.  Both of those companies largely care about users in some strong sense, much unlike certain other highly and chronically annoying entities.
One person's use is another person's abuse.  People should be aware.
Abuse is wrong, use may not be.  Sometimes depends on where you stand.  Some types don't have agreement.  Plenty of people hate the idea of automated ad filtering based on the content of email or chat or other activity.  There are things that could go wrong with that if it gets to a human or is gamed, but properly done anonymously, it can be fine: I'd rather get timely ads I may care about than the much larger set of uninteresting dreck.  I actually suggested doing exactly this with AOL chatrooms in about 1996. This is a good example of good education vs. bad education: If you say "This could be misused or leaked in a way that could be a problem if a company isn't careful, and here is a scenario..., and here is how that could be handled better..." that's fine, especially if a company can indicate the level of care & security they're currently employing.  If you say: "Google is reading your email, sending it to every company that wants to buy it for a few cents!" that's disingenuous at best and dangerous to certain people's mental state at worst.
I was mainly talking about making realistic decisions without a value statement for current practices, which we are all going to have different opinions on since they aren't public.
We should have some taxonomy of the nature of those abuses, with consensus lines drawn as to what we all find acceptable or not acceptable, why, and what mechanisms best resolve the issue.
Some are not at certain points, or all are not at some points, or only mine is as far as I know.  Take your pick.
Have you noticed the difference in nature of various companies over time?
Of course; it may not be worth anything, but I do actual work.  You don't?  You're not doing your taxes properly if not...  ;-)
Who CAN be trusted?  At some level, no one, but we've already established that in the real world, you generally have to trust people all the time.
Are you sure you are applying your distrust criteria in a comprehensive and rational way?
They pretty much still do.  And it is silly to say they can't.  They are a relatively giant company.  Mistakes happen.  What mistakes are they making now?
    You can make money without doing evil.
All companies that I know about are filled with people.  They may be sheeple a little too often (I have permanently fired ATT Mobile (formerly Cingular) for refusing to issue a refund to my son when they screwed up "because the policy prevents us".), but it is personal at some level.  You are trusting that the Comcast installer is not a murderer, that the banker isn't stealing from you, and that the well-paid Google engineer has better things to do than to eavesdrop on you.
Whether all are, or even a predominant amount are, is questionable. Many people care about customers, their career, mission, etc.  Money is only an issue occasionally.
There are some who have acted that way, for sure.  I have my black list.  Others try.  They deserve a little credit, and help when

You have never benefited in any way from the US marines?  The footprint there is pretty large.  You think they are somehow fundamentally evil when they don't determine their goals or rules of engagement?  Their job is to be a bad ass tool, the proverbial big stick.  It is someone else's job to decide how to use that tool. Marines don't kill people, politicians using Marines kill people. Err, something like that.

Is everyone from the CIA scumbags by definition?
FLOSS has bloatware?  Are you using the same meaning as the rest of us?  What's your favorite alternative?
Someone explaining bits of the world are not necessarily an apologist for those bits.  Trying to correct or moderate viewpoint extremism (see what I did there?) with more balance, or logic, or other viewpoints isn't necessarily being an apologist either; that's the kind of accusation that usually comes from someone slinging not fully supported barbs.  I do think Google is better than some other companies, but that's pretty weak on the apologist scale; I was more making a statement about a class of companies and how they should rationally act with respect to security.
What's your alternative to all of these things?  If you really are into security in any sense, you should be able to explain what security exposures moderating or eliminating those entities would cause and what you would advocate to replace them.
I'm offended in various ways by a lot of what happened in the past, often in organizations like DOJ, FBI, etc. that should have known better.  I would even say that a lot of government employees and contractors seem to have got away with a lot of things they shouldn't have.  But that doesn't mean that any of those organizations are fundamentally evil and aren't almost completely staffed by intelligent, respectable people.
Anyway, if you're still in the rebelling against authority stage, fine, have fun.  Good luck with that.  In the US, government wise, the people are the authority, their own authority in essence, it just may take a long time for that to play out in a given area.

Whatever you gotta believe.  Most of their job is to understand the world, publishing both a nice public database and the presidential daily brief (today's news).  And to consult with the President as need so that hopefully reasonably intelligent decisions are made, but that depends on the intelligence of the current president.
And FBI, CIA, State, Google, etc.

There are certain people, Marines et al, who are trained to be very lethal.  Sucks to need that, but being anything less than the strongest & baddest isn't an option for the US.  They are concentrated, supposed to be carefully deployed and directed. Create people like that from the subset of people who want to be like that and a few are going to go off the rails occasionally.

There are multiple avenues possible of assurance, architecture, audit, obfuscation, canaries, etc.  Perhaps encrypted computing will be useful; already encrypted storage is relatively easy to use for at least some circumstances (object stores, backup).  If billions of lightweight container-based compute transactions are flowing through a system that pools payment and has secure distributed storage and communication, is it possible to be too obscure to identify and tap?
Spammer scammers are practicing this kind of thing daily, and countermeasures are being created too, but as for most of that there is a final traceable step, email etc., that's not quite the same as some other private security goals.

Not really, more from warlords, dictators, etc.  Supposedly Russia is "only protecting their ethnic Russians".  From what?  Joining NATO and Western Europe as far as I could tell.
Yep, the US has been involved in all kinds of past situations, along with a number of other countries.  Those were indeed the bad old days.  Sometimes intentions were good, sometimes maybe not.  It's too bad that people 40-80 years ago didn't have 2015 sensibilities. Romans begat Europe, British begat a lot, including terrible treatment of Aborigines and Maori.  Europe decimated American Indians.  Slavery.  But you imply that past possibly-poor actions indicate present value.  Hardly.  None of those people are in power and most are dead.  Everyone has learned a lot, J. Edgar Hoover is no longer blackmailing US Presidents and everyone else to preserve his FBI empire, etc.  Americans beat up on America quite a bit and all of this eventually comes out, often these days as very watchable movies that authoritatively teach what we weren't taught in school, about the US and often the rest of the world.  Generally, lessons are learned and we do better in the future.  But occasionally someone slips in who is not an intellectual powerhouse and mistakes are made again.  Se la vie.  What's your better alternative?
Even when the US meddled, except for a very few circumstances, it was to achieve something useful, not to subjugate peoples for colonies, incorporation into an empire, etc.  The US pays a lot for legacy military bases everywhere, provides lots of protection and other benefits, and generally attempts fit in and be respectful.
What is your concept?  That no one have power to repel anyone else? That some other country / culture is better suited to being "on top"?  The US is the worst system, except for everything else.  It is deliberately designed to be messy, in conflict, and unstable. The genius of this arrangement is that it leads to a stronger result than anything else.
Many non-Americans don't really get America, even if they have visited or lived here.  Many Americans don't fully get America either; easy to be parochial.
Not long ago, someone was tearing into the US about teargas being used in some situation, how terrible and dangerous it was, etc.  I pointed out, with references, that every single American military individual is subjected to a good dose of teargas as part of training.
In some cases, regime change can be nice.  Depends on specifics.
Yea?  Interesting.  I think you've been watching Fox News too much. Or you are talking about New Jersey.  ;-)
We obsess about that stuff precisely because it isn't tolerated at all, except for narrowly acceptable, mostly noise levels.
How do you come to think this?  What's your evidence?
Yea?  What would constitute a fall for the US?  I don't think you understand the nature of the US or what would constitute a win.
Few would agree with that.
Depends on what you look at.  There are some things that we as a group definitely think were mistakes, Iraq etc.
What do you think the "success" of a USA grab for global hegemony would look like?  What do you think the USA end goal is if it wasn't "stopped"?
Your construction there seems off, but:
Much of aggression has been about answering threats, directly or indirectly.  So your statement doesn't apply to Afghanistan, WWII, etc.  Korea, Vietnam, etc. were about a perceived threat that seemed real; we generally consider those to probably have been wrong on multiple levels.  I guess you think that if anyone supports the US, they must be agreeing with everything that's ever happened. Obviously that's a terribly simplistic assumption.
"Capture the sanction of foreign thinkers"? Nonsense.

Keep reading.  As far as I know (and I've not paid diligently close attention to further developments after the aftermath died down, so please update my statements), the consensus is that that last update and the tongue-in-cheek directive to use Bitlocker was likely a warrant canary, i.e. they could no longer be independent and uncompromised so they burned the project, staying legal while upholding principles.
However, shortly thereafter others have taken the previous public open source version, forked it, in some cases begun (and maybe finished) an audit of the code.  The results of those should be usable as secure with some degree of confidence.  YMMV.

Everything will be run in the cloud and browser because it is, overall, a better computation model. However, that doesn't preclude you from running a cloud locally. Although pretty much proprietary to Google & Amazon until recently, Docker et al and related VM/container management APIs that are mappable to all kinds of implementations will allow apps, administration, networking, etc. to be fluid between commercial and various types of private clouds.
In a lot of ways, this is an elegant solution and could arguably be much more secure than desktop apps in Windows.  Assuming your container system isn't running in Windows, which is becoming an option; one that I won't trust easily.

The browser provides a super feature / security / quality / portable baseline that is rapidly improving.  Only a few alternatives come close and they all fall short in major ways: Qt (which greatly relies on browser tech now), Java & C Unity, UnReal, etc. Certain things are still better in those alternatives, but less and less.  With Javascript optimization, ASM.js, SIMD.js, WebGL, etc., browsers have, for most purposes, resolved the computational gap while having massively better security stance.  WebComponents, the new binary Javascript format, along with WebRTC, WebUSB, and other features, we're getting the cleanest app and platform model we've seen so far.
The key architectural questions about remote communication involve security, efficiency, stability, portability, etc.  While it isn't perfect, web tech provides a nice enough model for expressing the highest level logical communication needed in secure (enough for most purposes), flexible, efficient enough, and low latency enough for most purposes ways.  Solutions like Swagger, Go, and other modern techniques are much cleaner and simpler than previous clunky solutions.
Most of the most interesting web apps now run almost completely in the browser.  The server side sends the original page and code, manages authentication, then acts mostly as a database with minimal logic.  As long as the API doesn't rely solely on client-side validation and other things that could be gamed, it can still be secure.  Because it's now easy to run the same code on the front and back, complex validation could be done on the front-end for low latency and the backend for actual security, for instance.
There are plenty of things that could be better and will get better, but regardless the power & ease gap between web app development, for most situations, is only increasing.  Emulating any substantial subset of browser-level UI and other features in a non-browser desktop app is nearly impossible now.

Sharing all of your secrets, then prosecuting adversaries that make ill use of it, in court and the court of public opinion, is a valid path.  Better, throw in some misinformation so that they are mislead in self-sabotaging ways.

"Stolen code" isn't really an issue most of the time, but can be legally if a lot is used in a way that conflicts with a license. Reusing code snippets is, to a large extent, not really a copyright issue and often fair use or use of something that isn't really protected by copyright.  In any case, it is a legal issue separate from the security implications.
The FUD in question is whether there are security problems of some kind lurking in code, and whether it is easier to compromise a binary when you have source to start with.  The flip side is that it is easier to hide back doors in code that has limited access to source code.  Security mistakes, deliberate malware, and detection are possible in both cases, but in different ways, with different numbers of actual or potential people looking and with different likelihood of active positive or negative collusion.

Valid concerns in the abstract.  In practice, the economic concerns of big cloud providers means they must provide continually upgraded certainty of fundamental security separation.  Part of that is randomness of where your code runs: If there are millions of VMs on hundreds of thousands of physical servers, even if there is a VM escape, it is essentially impractical for malware to target your instance.  This could be enhanced by VM / container hopping in various senses.  Working within the system is likely to provide you a stronger result than something cobbled together locally.
However, we need solutions for that too, with and without cloud technology.  We need people who don't trust the cloud and keep developing better alternatives.  I think some of those alternatives involve cloud technology locally, but that's not a big thing.
I have friends who are rabid Google haters / fearmongers, apparently based on the fact that it was the first company they were aware of that seemed to have access and responsibility for too much information, or too much of their information, or too strong an allure for their information.  I feel perfectly confident that Google is going to protect their billions in income and valuation by being very careful with avoiding abusing their data or users in any strong sense.  That might not withstand a court order or national security letter or TLA hack monitoring unencrypted links, although big Silicon Valley companies recently have been getting tougher there.  But it certainly means they aren't "reading my email" for prurient or invasive purposes that would be embarrassing to me: It would become embarrassing to them quickly and cost millions or billions.

Perfectly within the realm of the possible.  A lone employee may be able to abuse things, but they likely will be caught, fired, and the incident has some chance of being righted and paid off.  Unlikely to actually be the case in any pervasive way.  Nearly all conspiracies leak eventually.  Being a commercial company, they are a huge target for a jackpot payday.  TLAs have no such worry, which is why when they do illegal things and otherwise drift or charge outside the boundaries that it is so bad.  A few years ago, before Congress stepped in to let them off the hook, phone companies like ATT were in a tight spot for allowing a lot of open access to customer data. I'm sure that legal departments everywhere took notice of that exposure; Congress isn't going to do that too many more times, and especially not for commercial gain.
Parallel construction is a big problem, although I think that it has been exposed in some major cases lately that should soften courts for detecting and confronting it.  It's possible both for prosecutors, TLAs, and companies wanting to steal proprietary trade secrets.  Perhaps practical and legal techniques used to combat insider trading may start to provide some protection.  It is at least possible to take countermeasures to expose parallel construction: information that provides ways of detecting eavesdropping is an obvious solution.
It is certainly the case that we should consider the possible, especially since there have been a number of surprises about how far things actually did go in the past, especially the TLAs, but also sometimes with companies with really bad culture.  But that red team gaming shouldn't spill over too much into our rational assessment of actual risks and reasonable countermeasures.  There is a typical problem I call the Fallacy of Insisting on Zero Risk: A mother fearing their children using the bathroom at the mall alone or calling the police because someone else's child walks to the park alone while thinking nothing of horse riding or football or rodeo or smoking.  Or OSHA related spending millions per death to prevent one type of injury while ignoring other much lower hanging injury risks.  Gun control, vaccines, playground equipment, etc. often involve similar elements.  When making actual concrete security choices, a rational actor considers the threat, opportunity, costs, rewards, exposure, overhead, etc. when weighing what measures are worth taking.
In a presentation to the Nevada Gaming Commission years ago, I used the analogy of protecting nuclear weapons: The cost of a compromise is nearly infinite, so the amount you would be willing to rationally invest to prevent a compromise also can be nearly infinite.  (But apparently not given recent events related to those crews.) Everything else falls in a lower tier where there is a cost / benefit tradeoff.  You can go far enough in taking measures that you are worse off than if you had been compromised in the worst probable way.  The question there was how much certainty was needed that an Internet gambler was of age.  We went through a similar thing related to porn: Early on, many jurisdictions insisted on absolute certainty that a remote viewer was of age, or a company-ending lawsuit or criminal case would result.  Now, porn is essentially wide open, with at most proof of control of a credit card required to verify age; easily bypassed by a determined teenager, who could legally have a Visa debit card anyway.  For one thing, most of the supposed damage (Meese report etc.) was bogus, so few controls are really called for.
Now, many of us here want to be able to protect ourselves and others out of principle, need, career, and/or interest.  We may find it fun and career worthy to have TLA / scammer / evil genius defeating countermeasures and tradecraft.  We may get to the point we actually need it, or work with clients who definitely do.  But we shouldn't slip into unnecessary paranoia, especially if it gets to the point of shooting ourselves in the foot.  When we're making an argument, we are often taking the paranoid view because that's required to get into the right mindset.  After determining how to prevent issues, we should then decide what is actually worth putting into place.
I've run my own physical Internet server, including my own DNS servers, since 1992 when I obtained my first domain name and started a couple ISPs.  For various reasons, I will continue to do that, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to others, especially the non-technical.  My uptime, currently at 267 days, is basically the lifetime of the hard drive or the rare case when the colo moves things around.

Traditional corporate onsite compute, storage, network, security, software (Oracle etc.) is almost always extremely expensive.  While a raw hard drive may be inexpensive, if you buy it in an EMC or mainframe storage array, you are going to pay many multiples more per GB, compute minute, etc.  And, if you bought anything more than you actually use, you're being very wasteful.  Parts of the cloud revolution are rapid just in time purchase, deployment, change, new scalable methods, etc., but economically, it is often tremendously less expensive than a commercial solution plus the support staff to make it work.  In the most efficient traditional local deployment possible, this may not be true initially, but for the vast majority of mediocre corporate IT departments, it is very true.
If you are large and/or savvy enough, the thing to do is to borrow cloud system methods and run a cloud for yourself.  Currently, that's not completely easy or turnkey.  At some point, we should get to a clean utility computing model, but it will take a few more generations of evolution.

It's 10x for the drive, another 10x for the box to put it in, another 10x for a license for the software to get to it, ... (Roughly. ;-) )  You can be nickle and dimed up front or over time. In the latter case, it will continue to get more competitive and begin to have local systems with the same characteristics.
How much does an additional 4TB of storage for a z13 cost?
Most cloud systems fall into the embarrassingly parallel category. Many smaller, cheaper, cooler units completely outclass, in price and scalability, bigger, faster, higher bandwidth solutions, unless those are built inexpensively with smaller, cheaper, cooler units. We're finding out whether medium sized (Intel/AMD desktop / server class CPUs) or small (ARM mobile chipsets) are going to scale better, but either way, a many node system has an aggregate memory bandwidth that dwarfs old-style mega CPU systems.  It's not clear, but it appears that the z13 is just an integrated cloud-style clustered system with a bunch of nice added features[2].  If so, which is the only way it could compete on scale and cost, it is a branded cloud system.  Would it really be less expensive to operate than an Open Compute local cloud?  Probably only if you made a lot of assumptions about overhead, etc.
The z13 looks cool, and has a lot of interesting features.  It will be interesting to see how it does.
If you have the type of business where you know what you need and how much of it you need, you can competitively provision a local solution, although there are still plenty of ways to go wrong.  And many do, IMHO.  Many businesses have relatively modest needs, don't know what their growth will look like, etc.  Large up front costs are bad in a lot of situations, as is committing to a certain scale when there is a lot of uncertainty.
The number of businesses and organizations who fit that narrow situation are few and dwindling.  Sales will be able to rope in plenty more for a while, but for many it is not a sane choice. Security breaks are mostly about passwords, trojans, spear phishing, zombie machines, etc.  For every possible exploit of a cloud system, which at the infrastructure level should have well-funded security, I feel there are many more gaps in the typical local alternative: Sloppy, old Windows systems with a sloppy network, open to everyone file servers, poor access control, terrible custom programming, no significant physical security, etc.  The best systems + networks + policies + personnel are more secure, everyone else is just lucky not to be targeted.
This covers some of this territory:

I hold multitudes.  I am in one thread totally cypherpunk, and have been for a very long time.  There are innumerable ways to compromise and be compromised for all kinds of good and mostly bad reasons.  Perfect protection is tough for in many ways and we should keep striving to get closer to that ideal security stance.
On the other hand, life is a balance.  I probably shouldn't have tried to make the point here, but it is something a security professional should understand well: The right amount of security should be moderated by the tradeoff of costs vs. overhead vs. maximizing benefit vs. minimizing loss.  Security stances change over time and aren't necessarily accurately reflected by paranoid An example along these lines that I like to keep in mind:
(I really did avoid writing down passwords anywhere for a long time.  And I still don't carry them with me.  If I did, they wouldn't be plaintext.)
It is terrible that some companies have been too eager to share information.  They may or may not have believed whatever safeguards were in place, or not cared, etc.  I'm sure a high pressure meeting with an FBI crew who are strongly playing the terrorism angle is persuasive, as it should be, up to a point. And companies holding your data can actually look at that data for business purposes, although how they use it is somewhat bounded by privacy laws (however incomplete), not making private things public, unfair business practices, etc.  My point was that the existence of large, valuable services that depend on a lot of trust is, or should be to a sane entity, an even stronger incentive to behave than the patchwork of laws.  Past oversharing, then embarrassment and public abuse, coupled with product impacts as they lose sensitive customers, has almost certainly caused a cleanup of those attitudes.  I'd be interested in the actual policy right now, although I doubt they are going to be too explicit.  I suspect that it also varies heavily by corporate culture.
Every day, you are somewhat at the mercy of dozens and perhaps thousands of people who could cause you pain, suffering, or death if they were so inclined.  There are many in the government, schools, employer personnel departments, medical and insurance companies, etc.  The people driving around you, stopped at a light while you cross the street, making your food, they all have access and the ability to inflict misery on you.  You have to trust someone to some extent.  The question is who you trust, how incentivized they and the people / organization around them protects you, whether wrongs will be limited, corrected, and righted or not.
For a long time, as a contractor at the peak of their heyday, I had access to AOL's entire user database, complete with name, address, full credit card info, phone numbers, etc.  I could have also snooped on their Buddylists, their person-to-person video (Instant Images), and a lot more.  There was zero chance that I would abuse any of that.

You're making an unqualified assumption about my unqualified qualifier "up to a point"...
Feel free.  I totally mock and rail about it too.  I can see several sides to this, and I've been on enough "sides" of these problems, at least in some weak sense, to have some model of decision making by people in those roles.  Poor decisions are understandable until there are enough cases, noticed and confronted, to make the right path clear.  We're getting a lot of those lately.  EFF, SPLC, ACLU, and others, sometimes including commercial entities, are providing an invaluable service of evolving both the law and internal commercial and government policy.
Hacking the system cleverly and deliberately is one of the cooler forms of hacking.
A few quibbles: for-profit is sociopathic-by-default perhaps, although even there you are assuming some socioeconomic system. You're also glossing over whether and when consent is an issue. People in public places sometimes believe that others need consent to take their picture; generally not true.  Is it rude to take your picture and does rudeness matter?  That depends.  "Beyond your expectations" is also problematic: How could any possible expectation ever be said to be adhered to?  Perhaps "generally accepted fair use as defined by EFF" or something (if there is such a thing) might be reasonable.  What is the definition of "many people"?
If you use language that can never be satisfied in any reliable way, you can't really complain that an entity isn't satisfying it.
Education is always good.  Don't infect others with pathological paranoia, but a healthy understanding of risks and exposures is always good.
Not inherently.  Social, economic, legal, contractual, and other cultural systems allow, disallow, guide, and control people in their interactions.  The US, for instance, has always been a place where there were many unwritten rules of operating in business.  Some have run roughshod over those, sometimes reaping unjust rewards and/or changing what is acceptable, but there are always things that could be done that just aren't.  Further, a particular entity could impose upon itself, by charter, culture, or customer agreement, a more stringent stance than others.  There could be mechanisms that audit or otherwise control this.
You get what you optimize for.  If you have a default corporation controlled by weak, shallow leaders and driven by shallow, blind Wall Street numbers, then the result is likely to be sociopathic. On the other hand, however imperfectly or incompletely, certain companies have a founder-driven culture of a far more empathic nature than this default, whether they be different or have a stated desire to not be evil.  Both of those companies largely care about users in some strong sense, much unlike certain other highly and chronically annoying entities.
One person's use is another person's abuse.  People should be aware.
Abuse is wrong, use may not be.  Sometimes depends on where you stand.  Some types don't have agreement.  Plenty of people hate the idea of automated ad filtering based on the content of email or chat or other activity.  There are things that could go wrong with that if it gets to a human or is gamed, but properly done anonymously, it can be fine: I'd rather get timely ads I may care about than the much larger set of uninteresting dreck.  I actually suggested doing exactly this with AOL chatrooms in about 1996. This is a good example of good education vs. bad education: If you say "This could be misused or leaked in a way that could be a problem if a company isn't careful, and here is a scenario..., and here is how that could be handled better..." that's fine, especially if a company can indicate the level of care & security they're currently employing.  If you say: "Google is reading your email, sending it to every company that wants to buy it for a few cents!" that's disingenuous at best and dangerous to certain people's mental state at worst.
I was mainly talking about making realistic decisions without a value statement for current practices, which we are all going to have different opinions on since they aren't public.
We should have some taxonomy of the nature of those abuses, with consensus lines drawn as to what we all find acceptable or not acceptable, why, and what mechanisms best resolve the issue.
Some are not at certain points, or all are not at some points, or only mine is as far as I know.  Take your pick.
Have you noticed the difference in nature of various companies over time?
Of course; it may not be worth anything, but I do actual work.  You don't?  You're not doing your taxes properly if not...  ;-)
Who CAN be trusted?  At some level, no one, but we've already established that in the real world, you generally have to trust people all the time.
Are you sure you are applying your distrust criteria in a comprehensive and rational way?
They pretty much still do.  And it is silly to say they can't.  They are a relatively giant company.  Mistakes happen.  What mistakes are they making now?
    You can make money without doing evil.
All companies that I know about are filled with people.  They may be sheeple a little too often (I have permanently fired ATT Mobile (formerly Cingular) for refusing to issue a refund to my son when they screwed up "because the policy prevents us".), but it is personal at some level.  You are trusting that the Comcast installer is not a murderer, that the banker isn't stealing from you, and that the well-paid Google engineer has better things to do than to eavesdrop on you.
Whether all are, or even a predominant amount are, is questionable. Many people care about customers, their career, mission, etc.  Money is only an issue occasionally.

I'm offended in various ways by a lot of what happened in the past, often in organizations like DOJ, FBI, etc. that should have known better.  I would even say that a lot of government employees and contractors seem to have got away with a lot of things they shouldn't have.  But that doesn't mean that any of those organizations are fundamentally evil and aren't almost completely staffed by intelligent, respectable people.
Anyway, if you're still in the rebelling against authority stage, fine, have fun.  Good luck with that.  In the US, government wise, the people are the authority, their own authority in essence, it just may take a long time for that to play out in a given area.  In some ways, this is also true for companies, with some nuance.

The Pentagon et al are protecting a large portion of the world from being overrun.  Nobody else will do it.
Are police always bad too?
Whatever you gotta believe.  Most of their job is to understand the world, publishing both a nice public database and the presidential daily brief (today's news).  And to consult with the President as need so that hopefully reasonably intelligent decisions are made, but that depends on the intelligence of the current president.
And FBI, CIA, State, Google, etc.
DOJ, Treasury, State, HHS, etc. are filled with worthless murdering scumbags?
There are certain people, Marines et al, who are trained to be very lethal.  Sucks to need that, but being anything less than the strongest & baddest isn't an option for the US.  They are concentrated, supposed to be carefully deployed and directed. Create people like that from the subset of people who want to be like that and a few are going to go off the rails occasionally. That's a bummer, and needs to be constantly protected against, but there's no obvious alternative.
The US is the least imperialist top superpower that ever existed. Still not perfect, but better than all the rest.

Just for fun, I reread this.  Based just on the text of this page, there is little that is really a gotcha of any significance.  A bunch of well-placed, powerful people know each other, bla bla. Google Ideas is trying to spread access to the Internet far and wide and, like any US citizen or company should, consults with the State department when doing anything with a non-first-world-country.  The CIA might also want Internet access far and wide in those countries, perhaps for fairly great reasons: general education, anti-propaganda, etc.  A modern, educated, liberal technologist wants to counteract extremism with education in any way feasible, oh my.  The government is paying for services they are using?  Is that unusual?

Polymer 1.0 web app, which is the cleanest HTML / Javascript yet, talking via Swagger IO library to a Go single-executable Docker container (break out of that!) with a very simple matching webAPI app structure...  That was some work to find, validate, and select; you're welcome.

There are multiple avenues possible of assurance, architecture, audit, obfuscation, canaries, etc.  Perhaps encrypted computing will be useful; already encrypted storage is relatively easy to use for at least some circumstances (object stores, backup).  If billions of lightweight container-based compute transactions are flowing through a system that pools payment and has secure distributed storage and communication, is it possible to be too obscure to identify and tap?

Yep, the US has been involved in all kinds of past situations, along with a number of other countries.  Those were indeed the bad old days.  Sometimes intentions were good, sometimes maybe not.  It's too bad that people 40-80 years ago didn't have 2015 sensibilities. Romans begat Europe, British begat a lot, including terrible treatment of Aborigines and Maori.  Europe decimated American Indians.  Slavery.  But you imply that past possibly-poor actions indicate present value.  Hardly.  None of those people are in power and most are dead.  Everyone has learned a lot, J. Edgar Hoover is no longer blackmailing US Presidents and everyone else to preserve his FBI empire, etc.  Americans beat up on America quite a bit and all of this eventually comes out, often these days as very watchable movies that authoritatively teach what we weren't taught in school, about the US and often the rest of the world.  Generally, lessons are learned and we do better in the future.  But occasionally someone slips in who is not an intellectual powerhouse and mistakes are made again.  Se la vie.  What's your better alternative?
Even when the US meddled, except for a very few circumstances, it was to achieve something useful, not to subjugate peoples for colonies, incorporation into an empire, etc.  The US pays a lot for legacy military bases everywhere, provides lots of protection and other benefits, and generally attempts fit in and be respectful.
What is your concept?  That no one have power to repel anyone else? That some other country / culture is better suited to being "on top"?  The US is the worst system, except for everything else.  It is deliberately designed to be messy, in conflict, and unstable. The genius of this arrangement is that it leads to a stronger result than anything else.
Many non-Americans don't really get America, even if they have visited or lived here.  Many Americans don't fully get America either; easy to be parochial.
Not long ago, someone was tearing into the US about teargas being used in some situation, how terrible and dangerous it was, etc.  I pointed out, with references, that every single American military individual is subjected to a good dose of teargas as part of training.
In some cases, regime change can be nice.  Depends on specifics.
Yea?  Interesting.  I think you've been watching Fox News too much. Or you are talking about New Jersey.  ;-)
We obsess about that stuff precisely because it isn't tolerated at all, except for narrowly acceptable, mostly noise levels.
How do you come to think this?  What's your evidence?
Yea?  What would constitute a fall for the US?  I don't think you understand the nature of the US or what would constitute a win.
Few would agree with that.
Depends on what you look at.  There are some things that we as a group definitely think were mistakes, Iraq etc.
What do you think the "success" of a USA grab for global hegemony would look like?  What do you think the USA end goal is if it wasn't "stopped"?
Your construction there seems off, but:
Much of aggression has been about answering threats, directly or indirectly.  So your statement doesn't apply to Afghanistan, WWII, etc.  Korea, Vietnam, etc. were about a perceived threat that seemed real; we generally consider those to probably have been wrong on multiple levels.  I guess you think that if anyone supports the US, they must be agreeing with everything that's ever happened. Obviously that's a terribly simplistic assumption.
"Capture the sanction of foreign thinkers"? Nonsense.

Keep reading.  As far as I know (and I've not paid diligently close attention to further developments after the aftermath died down, so please update my statements), the consensus is that that last update and the tongue-in-cheek directive to use Bitlocker was likely a warrant canary, i.e. they could no longer be independent and uncompromised so they burned the project, staying legal while upholding principles.
However, shortly thereafter others have taken the previous public open source version, forked it, in some cases begun (and maybe finished) an audit of the code.  The results of those should be usable as secure with some degree of confidence.  YMMV.

Everything will be run in the cloud and browser because it is, overall, a better computation model. However, that doesn't preclude you from running a cloud locally. Although pretty much proprietary to Google & Amazon until recently, Docker et al and related VM/container management APIs that are mappable to all kinds of implementations will allow apps, administration, networking, etc. to be fluid between commercial and various types of private clouds.
In a lot of ways, this is an elegant solution and could arguably be much more secure than desktop apps in Windows.  Assuming your container system isn't running in Windows, which is becoming an option; one that I won't trust easily.

The browser provides a super feature / security / quality / portable baseline that is rapidly improving.  Only a few alternatives come close and they all fall short in major ways: Qt (which greatly relies on browser tech now), Java & C Unity, UnReal, etc. Certain things are still better in those alternatives, but less and less.  With Javascript optimization, ASM.js, SIMD.js, WebGL, etc., browsers have, for most purposes, resolved the computational gap while having massively better security stance.  WebComponents, the new binary Javascript format, along with WebRTC, WebUSB, and other features, we're getting the cleanest app and platform model we've seen so far.
The key architectural questions about remote communication involve security, efficiency, stability, portability, etc.  While it isn't perfect, web tech provides a nice enough model for expressing the highest level logical communication needed in secure (enough for most purposes), flexible, efficient enough, and low latency enough for most purposes ways.  Solutions like Swagger, Go, and other modern techniques are much cleaner and simpler than previous clunky solutions.
Most of the most interesting web apps now run almost completely in the browser.  The server side sends the original page and code, manages authentication, then acts mostly as a database with minimal logic.  As long as the API doesn't rely solely on client-side validation and other things that could be gamed, it can still be secure.  Because it's now easy to run the same code on the front and back, complex validation could be done on the front-end for low latency and the backend for actual security, for instance.
There are plenty of things that could be better and will get better, but regardless the power & ease gap between web app development, for most situations, is only increasing.  Emulating any substantial subset of browser-level UI and other features in a non-browser desktop app is nearly impossible now.

"Stolen code" isn't really an issue most of the time, but can be legally if a lot is used in a way that conflicts with a license. Reusing code snippets is, to a large extent, not really a copyright issue and often fair use or use of something that isn't really protected by copyright.  In any case, it is a legal issue separate from the security implications.
The FUD in question is whether there are security problems of some kind lurking in code, and whether it is easier to compromise a binary when you have source to start with.  The flip side is that it is easier to hide back doors in code that has limited access to source code.  Security mistakes, deliberate malware, and detection are possible in both cases, but in different ways, with different numbers of actual or potential people looking and with different likelihood of active positive or negative collusion.

Valid concerns in the abstract.  In practice, the economic concerns of big cloud providers means they must provide continually upgraded certainty of fundamental security separation.  Part of that is randomness of where your code runs: If there are millions of VMs on hundreds of thousands of physical servers, even if there is a VM escape, it is essentially impractical for malware to target your instance.  This could be enhanced by VM / container hopping in various senses.  Working within the system is likely to provide you a stronger result than something cobbled together locally.
However, we need solutions for that too, with and without cloud technology.  We need people who don't trust the cloud and keep developing better alternatives.  I think some of those alternatives involve cloud technology locally, but that's not a big thing.
I have friends who are rabid Google haters / fearmongers, apparently based on the fact that it was the first company they were aware of that seemed to have access and responsibility for too much information, or too much of their information, or too strong an allure for their information.  I feel perfectly confident that Google is going to protect their billions in income and valuation by being very careful with avoiding abusing their data or users in any strong sense.  That might not withstand a court order or national security letter or TLA hack monitoring unencrypted links, although big Silicon Valley companies recently have been getting tougher there.  But it certainly means they aren't "reading my email" for prurient or invasive purposes that would be embarrassing to me: It would become embarrassing to them quickly and cost millions or billions.

Perfectly within the realm of the possible.  A lone employee may be able to abuse things, but they likely will be caught, fired, and the incident has some chance of being righted and paid off.  Unlikely to actually be the case in any pervasive way.  Nearly all conspiracies leak eventually.  Being a commercial company, they are a huge target for a jackpot payday.  TLAs have no such worry, which is why when they do illegal things and otherwise drift or charge outside the boundaries that it is so bad.  A few years ago, before Congress stepped in to let them off the hook, phone companies like ATT were in a tight spot for allowing a lot of open access to customer data. I'm sure that legal departments everywhere took notice of that exposure; Congress isn't going to do that too many more times, and especially not for commercial gain.
Parallel construction is a big problem, although I think that it has been exposed in some major cases lately that should soften courts for detecting and confronting it.  It's possible both for prosecutors, TLAs, and companies wanting to steal proprietary trade secrets.  Perhaps practical and legal techniques used to combat insider trading may start to provide some protection.  It is at least possible to take countermeasures to expose parallel construction: information that provides ways of detecting eavesdropping is an obvious solution.
It is certainly the case that we should consider the possible, especially since there have been a number of surprises about how far things actually did go in the past, especially the TLAs, but also sometimes with companies with really bad culture.  But that red team gaming shouldn't spill over too much into our rational assessment of actual risks and reasonable countermeasures.  There is a typical problem I call the Fallacy of Insisting on Zero Risk: A mother fearing their children using the bathroom at the mall alone or calling the police because someone else's child walks to the park alone while thinking nothing of horse riding or football or rodeo or smoking.  Or OSHA related spending millions per death to prevent one type of injury while ignoring other much lower hanging injury risks.  Gun control, vaccines, playground equipment, etc. often involve similar elements.  When making actual concrete security choices, a rational actor considers the threat, opportunity, costs, rewards, exposure, overhead, etc. when weighing what measures are worth taking.
In a presentation to the Nevada Gaming Commission years ago, I used the analogy of protecting nuclear weapons: The cost of a compromise is nearly infinite, so the amount you would be willing to rationally invest to prevent a compromise also can be nearly infinite.  (But apparently not given recent events related to those crews.) Everything else falls in a lower tier where there is a cost / benefit tradeoff.  You can go far enough in taking measures that you are worse off than if you had been compromised in the worst probable way.  The question there was how much certainty was needed that an Internet gambler was of age.  We went through a similar thing related to porn: Early on, many jurisdictions insisted on absolute certainty that a remote viewer was of age, or a company-ending lawsuit or criminal case would result.  Now, porn is essentially wide open, with at most proof of control of a credit card required to verify age; easily bypassed by a determined teenager, who could legally have a Visa debit card anyway.  For one thing, most of the supposed damage (Meese report etc.) was bogus, so few controls are really called for.
Now, many of us here want to be able to protect ourselves and others out of principle, need, career, and/or interest.  We may find it fun and career worthy to have TLA / scammer / evil genius defeating countermeasures and tradecraft.  We may get to the point we actually need it, or work with clients who definitely do.  But we shouldn't slip into unnecessary paranoia, especially if it gets to the point of shooting ourselves in the foot.  When we're making an argument, we are often taking the paranoid view because that's required to get into the right mindset.  After determining how to prevent issues, we should then decide what is actually worth putting into place.
I've run my own physical Internet server, including my own DNS servers, since 1992 when I obtained my first domain name and started a couple ISPs.  For various reasons, I will continue to do that, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to others, especially the non-technical.

Traditional corporate onsite compute, storage, network, security, software (Oracle etc.) is almost always extremely expensive.  While a raw hard drive may be inexpensive, if you buy it in an EMC or mainframe storage array, you are going to pay many multiples more per GB, compute minute, etc.  And, if you bought anything more than you actually use, you're being very wasteful.  Parts of the cloud revolution are rapid just in time purchase, deployment, change, new scalable methods, etc., but economically, it is often tremendously less expensive than a commercial solution plus the support staff to make it work.  In the most efficient traditional local deployment possible, this may not be true initially, but for the vast majority of mediocre corporate IT departments, it is very true.
If you are large and/or savvy enough, the thing to do is to borrow cloud system methods and run a cloud for yourself.  Currently, that's not completely easy or turnkey.  At some point, we should get to a clean utility computing model, but it will take a few more generations of evolution.

It's 10x for the drive, another 10x for the box to put it in, another 10x for a license for the software to get to it, ... (Roughly. ;-) )  You can be nickle and dimed up front or over time. In the latter case, it will continue to get more competitive and begin to have local systems with the same characteristics.
How much does an additional 4TB of storage for a z13 cost?
Most cloud systems fall into the embarrassingly parallel category. Many smaller, cheaper, cooler units completely outclass, in price and scalability, bigger, faster, higher bandwidth solutions, unless those are built inexpensively with smaller, cheaper, cooler units. We're finding out whether medium sized (Intel/AMD desktop / server class CPUs) or small (ARM mobile chipsets) are going to scale better, but either way, a many node system has an aggregate memory bandwidth that dwarfs old-style mega CPU systems.  It's not clear, but it appears that the z13 is just an integrated cloud-style clustered system with a bunch of nice added features[2].  If so, which is the only way it could compete on scale and cost, it is a branded cloud system.  Would it really be less expensive to operate than an Open Compute local cloud?  Probably only if you made a lot of assumptions about overhead, etc.
The z13 looks cool, and has a lot of interesting features.  It will be interesting to see how it does.
If you have the type of business where you know what you need and how much of it you need, you can competitively provision a local solution, although there are still plenty of ways to go wrong.  And many do, IMHO.  Many businesses have relatively modest needs, don't know what their growth will look like, etc.  Large up front costs are bad in a lot of situations, as is committing to a certain scale when there is a lot of uncertainty.
The number of businesses and organizations who fit that narrow situation are few and dwindling.  Sales will be able to rope in plenty more for a while, but for many it is not a sane choice. Security breaks are mostly about passwords, trojans, spear phishing, zombie machines, etc.  For every possible exploit of a cloud system, which at the infrastructure level should have well-funded security, I feel there are many more gaps in the typical local alternative: Sloppy, old Windows systems with a sloppy network, open to everyone file servers, poor access control, terrible custom programming, no significant physical security, etc.  The best systems + networks + policies + personnel are more secure, everyone else is just lucky not to be targeted.
This covers some of this territory:

I hold multitudes.  I am in one thread totally cypherpunk, and have been for a very long time.  There are innumerable ways to compromise and be compromised for all kinds of good and mostly bad reasons.  Perfect protection is tough for in many ways and we should keep striving to get closer to that ideal security stance.
On the other hand, life is a balance.  I probably shouldn't have tried to make the point here, but it is something a security professional should understand well: The right amount of security should be moderated by the tradeoff of costs vs. overhead vs. maximizing benefit vs. minimizing loss.  Security stances change over time and aren't necessarily accurately reflected by paranoid An example along these lines that I like to keep in mind:
(I really did avoid writing down passwords anywhere for a long time.  And I still don't carry them with me.  If I did, they wouldn't be plaintext.)
It is terrible that some companies have been too eager to share information.  They may or may not have believed whatever safeguards were in place, or not cared, etc.  I'm sure a high pressure meeting with an FBI crew who are strongly playing the terrorism angle is persuasive, as it should be, up to a point. And companies holding your data can actually look at that data for business purposes, although how they use it is somewhat bounded by privacy laws (however incomplete), not making private things public, unfair business practices, etc.  My point was that the existence of large, valuable services that depend on a lot of trust is, or should be to a sane entity, an even stronger incentive to behave than the patchwork of laws.  Past oversharing, then embarrassment and public abuse, coupled with product impacts as they lose sensitive customers, has almost certainly caused a cleanup of those attitudes.  I'd be interested in the actual policy right now, although I doubt they are going to be too explicit.  I suspect that it also varies heavily by corporate culture.
Every day, you are somewhat at the mercy of dozens and perhaps thousands of people who could cause you pain, suffering, or death if they were so inclined.  There are many in the government, schools, employer personnel departments, medical and insurance companies, etc.  The people driving around you, stopped at a light while you cross the street, making your food, they all have access and the ability to inflict misery on you.  You have to trust someone to some extent.  The question is who you trust, how incentivized they and the people / organization around them protects you, whether wrongs will be limited, corrected, and righted or not.
For a long time, as a contractor at the peak of their heyday, I had access to AOL's entire user database, complete with name, address, full credit card info, phone numbers, etc.  I could have also snooped on their Buddylists, their person-to-person video (Instant Images), and a lot more.  There was zero chance that I would abuse any of that.

You're making an unqualified assumption about my unqualified qualifier "up to a point"...
Feel free.  I totally mock and rail about it too.  I can see several sides to this, and I've been on enough "sides" of these problems, at least in some weak sense, to have some model of decision making by people in those roles.  Poor decisions are understandable until there are enough cases, noticed and confronted, to make the right path clear.  We're getting a lot of those lately.  EFF, SPLC, ACLU, and others, sometimes including commercial entities, are providing an invaluable service of evolving both the law and internal commercial and government policy.
Hacking the system cleverly and deliberately is one of the cooler forms of hacking.
A few quibbles: for-profit is sociopathic-by-default perhaps, although even there you are assuming some socioeconomic system. You're also glossing over whether and when consent is an issue. People in public places sometimes believe that others need consent to take their picture; generally not true.  Is it rude to take your picture and does rudeness matter?  That depends.  "Beyond your expectations" is also problematic: How could any possible expectation ever be said to be adhered to?  Perhaps "generally accepted fair use as defined by EFF" or something (if there is such a thing) might be reasonable.  What is the definition of "many people"?
If you use language that can never be satisfied in any reliable way, you can't really complain that an entity isn't satisfying it.
Education is always good.  Don't infect others with pathological paranoia, but a healthy understanding of risks and exposures is always good.
Not inherently.  Social, economic, legal, contractual, and other cultural systems allow, disallow, guide, and control people in their interactions.  The US, for instance, has always been a place where there were many unwritten rules of operating in business.  Some have run roughshod over those, sometimes reaping unjust rewards and/or changing what is acceptable, but there are always things that could be done that just aren't.  Further, a particular entity could impose upon itself, by charter, culture, or customer agreement, a more stringent stance than others.  There could be mechanisms that audit or otherwise control this.
You get what you optimize for.  If you have a default corporation controlled by weak, shallow leaders and driven by shallow, blind Wall Street numbers, then the result is likely to be sociopathic. On the other hand, however imperfectly or incompletely, certain companies have a founder-driven culture of a far more empathic nature than this default, whether they be different or have a stated desire to not be evil.  Both of those companies largely care about users in some strong sense, much unlike certain other highly and chronically annoying entities.
One person's use is another person's abuse.  People should be aware.
Abuse is wrong, use may not be.  Sometimes depends on where you stand.  Some types don't have agreement.  Plenty of people hate the idea of automated ad filtering based on the content of email or chat or other activity.  There are things that could go wrong with that if it gets to a human or is gamed, but properly done anonymously, it can be fine: I'd rather get timely ads I may care about than the much larger set of uninteresting dreck.  I actually suggested doing exactly this with AOL chatrooms in about 1996. This is a good example of good education vs. bad education: If you say "This could be misused or leaked in a way that could be a problem if a company isn't careful, and here is a scenario..., and here is how that could be handled better..." that's fine, especially if a company can indicate the level of care & security they're currently employing.  If you say: "Google is reading your email, sending it to every company that wants to buy it for a few cents!" that's disingenuous at best and dangerous to certain people's mental state at worst.
I was mainly talking about making realistic decisions without a value statement for current practices, which we are all going to have different opinions on since they aren't public.
We should have some taxonomy of the nature of those abuses, with consensus lines drawn as to what we all find acceptable or not acceptable, why, and what mechanisms best resolve the issue.
Some are not at certain points, or all are not at some points, or only mine is as far as I know.  Take your pick.
Have you noticed the difference in nature of various companies over time?
Of course; it may not be worth anything, but I do actual work.  You don't?  You're not doing your taxes properly if not...  ;-)
Who CAN be trusted?  At some level, no one, but we've already established that in the real world, you generally have to trust people all the time.
Are you sure you are applying your distrust criteria in a comprehensive and rational way?
They pretty much still do.  And it is silly to say they can't.  They are a relatively giant company.  Mistakes happen.  What mistakes are they making now?
    You can make money without doing evil.
All companies that I know about are filled with people.  They may be sheeple a little too often (I have permanently fired ATT Mobile (formerly Cingular) for refusing to issue a refund to my son when they screwed up "because the policy prevents us".), but it is personal at some level.  You are trusting that the Comcast installer is not a murderer, that the banker isn't stealing from you, and that the well-paid Google engineer has better things to do than to eavesdrop on you.
Whether all are, or even a predominant amount are, is questionable. Many people care about customers, their career, mission, etc.  Money is only an issue occasionally.
There are some who have acted that way, for sure.  I have my black list.  Others try.  They deserve a little credit, and help when

Are you saying that the Pentagon is never good or useful?  Nor are any of their spying efforts?
They don't?
You have never benefited in any way from the US marines?  The footprint there is pretty large.  You think they are somehow fundamentally evil when they don't determine their goals or rules of engagement?  Their job is to be a bad ass tool, the proverbial big stick.  It is someone else's job to decide how to use that tool. Marines don't kill people, politicians using Marines kill people. Err, something like that.
There are high ranking scumbags from the CIA here?  Interesting.
Is everyone from the CIA scumbags by definition?
FLOSS has bloatware?  Are you using the same meaning as the rest of us?  What's your favorite alternative?
Someone explaining bits of the world are not necessarily an apologist for those bits.  Trying to correct or moderate viewpoint extremism (see what I did there?) with more balance, or logic, or other viewpoints isn't necessarily being an apologist either; that's the kind of accusation that usually comes from someone slinging not fully supported barbs.  I do think Google is better than some other companies, but that's pretty weak on the apologist scale; I was more making a statement about a class of companies and how they should rationally act with respect to security.
What's your alternative to all of these things?  If you really are into security in any sense, you should be able to explain what security exposures moderating or eliminating those entities would cause and what you would advocate to replace them.
I'm offended in various ways by a lot of what happened in the past, often in organizations like DOJ, FBI, etc. that should have known better.  I would even say that a lot of government employees and contractors seem to have got away with a lot of things they shouldn't have.  But that doesn't mean that any of those organizations are fundamentally evil and aren't almost completely staffed by intelligent, respectable people.
Anyway, if you're still in the rebelling against authority stage, fine, have fun.  Good luck with that.  In the US, government wise, the people are the authority, their own authority in essence, it just may take a long time for that to play out in a given area.  In some ways, this is also true for companies, with some nuance.

The Pentagon et al are protecting a large portion of the world from being overrun.  Nobody else will do it.
Are police always bad too?
Whatever you gotta believe.  Most of their job is to understand the world, publishing both a nice public database and the presidential daily brief (today's news).  And to consult with the President as need so that hopefully reasonably intelligent decisions are made, but that depends on the intelligence of the current president.
And FBI, CIA, State, Google, etc.
DOJ, Treasury, State, HHS, etc. are filled with worthless murdering scumbags?
There are certain people, Marines et al, who are trained to be very lethal.  Sucks to need that, but being anything less than the strongest & baddest isn't an option for the US.  They are concentrated, supposed to be carefully deployed and directed. Create people like that from the subset of people who want to be like that and a few are going to go off the rails occasionally. That's a bummer, and needs to be constantly protected against, but there's no obvious alternative.
The US is the least imperialist top superpower that ever existed. Still not perfect, but better than all the rest.
Oh kay.  Are  you off your meds?
You haven't been watching long or closely enough.  Things have changed a lot in the US in my lifetime, and it's only speeding up.

Just for fun, I reread this.  Based just on the text of this page, there is little that is really a gotcha of any significance.  A bunch of well-placed, powerful people know each other, bla bla. Google Ideas is trying to spread access to the Internet far and wide and, like any US citizen or company should, consults with the State department when doing anything with a non-first-world-country.  The CIA might also want Internet access far and wide in those countries, perhaps for fairly great reasons: general education, anti-propaganda, etc.  A modern, educated, liberal technologist wants to counteract extremism with education in any way feasible, oh my.  The government is paying for services they are using?  Is that unusual?
Where is there something that is actually illegal, regressive, or otherwise actually a problem?  Plenty of innuendo and situations that could potentially be bad, but where's the meat?
I like Wikileaks at all overall.  Very entertaining, and some people should stay organized while heavily scrutinizing those in power to detect and expose abuse, or even the appearance of abuse.

There are multiple avenues possible of assurance, architecture, audit, obfuscation, canaries, etc.  Perhaps encrypted computing will be useful; already encrypted storage is relatively easy to use for at least some circumstances (object stores, backup).  If billions of lightweight container-based compute transactions are flowing through a system that pools payment and has secure distributed storage and communication, is it possible to be too obscure to identify and tap?
Spammer scammers are practicing this kind of thing daily, and countermeasures are being created too, but as for most of that there is a final traceable step, email etc., that's not quite the same as some other private security goals.

Not really, more from warlords, dictators, etc.  Supposedly Russia is "only protecting their ethnic Russians".  From what?  Joining NATO and Western Europe as far as I could tell.
Yep, the US has been involved in all kinds of past situations, along with a number of other countries.  Those were indeed the bad old days.  Sometimes intentions were good, sometimes maybe not.  It's too bad that people 40-80 years ago didn't have 2015 sensibilities. Romans begat Europe, British begat a lot, including terrible treatment of Aborigines and Maori.  Europe decimated American Indians.  Slavery.  But you imply that past possibly-poor actions indicate present value.  Hardly.  None of those people are in power and most are dead.  Everyone has learned a lot, J. Edgar Hoover is no longer blackmailing US Presidents and everyone else to preserve his FBI empire, etc.  Americans beat up on America quite a bit and all of this eventually comes out, often these days as very watchable movies that authoritatively teach what we weren't taught in school, about the US and often the rest of the world.  Generally, lessons are learned and we do better in the future.  But occasionally someone slips in who is not an intellectual powerhouse and mistakes are made again.  Se la vie.  What's your better alternative?
Even when the US meddled, except for a very few circumstances, it was to achieve something useful, not to subjugate peoples for colonies, incorporation into an empire, etc.  The US pays a lot for legacy military bases everywhere, provides lots of protection and other benefits, and generally attempts fit in and be respectful.
What is your concept?  That no one have power to repel anyone else? That some other country / culture is better suited to being "on top"?  The US is the worst system, except for everything else.  It is deliberately designed to be messy, in conflict, and unstable. The genius of this arrangement is that it leads to a stronger result than anything else.
Many non-Americans don't really get America, even if they have visited or lived here.  Many Americans don't fully get America either; easy to be parochial.
Not long ago, someone was tearing into the US about teargas being used in some situation, how terrible and dangerous it was, etc.  I pointed out, with references, that every single American military individual is subjected to a good dose of teargas as part of training.
In some cases, regime change can be nice.  Depends on specifics.
Yea?  Interesting.  I think you've been watching Fox News too much. Or you are talking about New Jersey.  ;-)
We obsess about that stuff precisely because it isn't tolerated at all, except for narrowly acceptable, mostly noise levels.
How do you come to think this?  What's your evidence?
Yea?  What would constitute a fall for the US?  I don't think you understand the nature of the US or what would constitute a win.
Few would agree with that.
Depends on what you look at.  There are some things that we as a group definitely think were mistakes, Iraq etc.
What do you think the "success" of a USA grab for global hegemony would look like?  What do you think the USA end goal is if it wasn't "stopped"?
Your construction there seems off, but:
Much of aggression has been about answering threats, directly or indirectly.  So your statement doesn't apply to Afghanistan, WWII, etc.  Korea, Vietnam, etc. were about a perceived threat that seemed real; we generally consider those to probably have been wrong on multiple levels.  I guess you think that if anyone supports the US, they must be agreeing with everything that's ever happened. Obviously that's a terribly simplistic assumption.
"Capture the sanction of foreign thinkers"? Nonsense.

Keep reading.  As far as I know (and I've not paid diligently close attention to further developments after the aftermath died down, so please update my statements), the consensus is that that last update and the tongue-in-cheek directive to use Bitlocker was likely a warrant canary, i.e. they could no longer be independent and uncompromised so they burned the project, staying legal while upholding principles.
However, shortly thereafter others have taken the previous public open source version, forked it, in some cases begun (and maybe finished) an audit of the code.  The results of those should be usable as secure with some degree of confidence.  YMMV.

But there is a payment history, it's been in the same location for 8 years, etc.  When I imagine a more secure (in certain senses) alternative, as least as an individual, it usually involves public cloud services, perhaps in some ephemeral rotating basis way.  First you need to secure DNS, or some similar alternative, then...  Tor or similar helps for a certain class of usage, but then you're outside the normal Internet world.  Without interesting goals, no point in interesting solutions other than knowing how to do interesting solutions and what their limitations are.  Which is a good thing in and of itself.

cypherpunks
Keep in mind that key players in the US are trying to keep all of this in mind, learning from mistakes.  You cannot go back, you can
only try to find a way forward.
Noticed this document today.  The article on page 77, /The Critical Role of Cultural Orientation/, is excellent.
The Critical Role of Cultural Orientation
Edward L. Peck
I have been asked to speak on the subject of culture, and the title I have chosen is “The Shock of Foreign Cultures—Especially
Yours.” Yours may seem as strange to them as theirs may seem to you. No surprise there, but think about cultures and subcultures for
a second. In my terminology, they are the result of multiple inputs on groups of people over a period of time. You learn, in the
home, the neighborhood, the military, the State Department, as an American, as an Ethiopian, whatever, how it is you’re supposed to
Let’s just take religion. Religious beliefs will impact on the way you and your subculture see things. This is an important point to
bear in mind. If there are 4,321 recognized religions in this world—and you should be aware that most, I think it’s about 86.213
percent, verbalized statistics are made up on the spot—if there are 4,321 recognized religions, then 4,320 of them are wrong.
Because they can’t all be right, can they? Well, mine is and yours isn’t. Religion is going to make a difference.
How about history? Think about Iraq for just a moment. The British occupation ended in 1932, which means that there are living
Iraqis who remember what an occupation is. And don’t forget that they were occupied for almost 400 years before that by the Turks.
So they’ve been there; this has been done to them. When you talk about occupation to those folks, they know what you’re talking
about. It’s part of their cultural history, which is why our president, a year ago, apologized for using the word “crusade” in
talking about our activities in the Middle East. Out there they know what that is, even though it was 1,000 years ago. In the
Crusades, as some of you may remember, the Christians came down from Europe and killed every Muslim and Jew they could lay their
hands on, plus any Christians that weren’t Christian enough.
Now, the people of the Middle East have not forgotten. If you go down to Birmingham or Savannah, they will talk to you, very
heatedly, about something they call the War of Northern Aggression. That was 150 years ago, but they have not forgotten it. And it
has an impact on how they see things, because history, even though it didn’t happen to you personally, is one of the things that
affects your view of things.
How about languages? The word jihad in Arabic means “struggle.” It does not mean holy war. You can call it holy war, but that’s not
what the word means. How about the political system? Whether it’s a titular head, whether it’s a king, whether it’s a democracy. How
about the economy and how you’re living?
How about such things as prejudice? Now, this is not a dirty word, you understand. It merely means making a decision before you have
all the facts. Anyone guilty of that over the last 48 hours raise your hand. Prejudice is going to color how people see things. So
will class structure, or the lack thereof. So will education, or the lack thereof. All of these things, and the family, and
geography, affect how cultures interact—their attitudes, their values, their behavior. These things are terribly important when you
go to really different cultures.
Cultural behavior is learned. Nobody teaches you this stuff. How come we all do the “V” for Victory this way? How come you don’t do
it palm in? Because you learned to do it palm out. Winston Churchill brought us this gesture in World War II, and the reason he did
it palm out is that, in the United Kingdom doing it palm in is an obscene gesture. You don’t need to know that; everybody does it
the same way, and only that way. It’s a cultural thing.
My oldest son has lived in Tokyo for 20 years. He says, “It’s not my skin or eye color or face that makes me remember I’m a
foreigner, Dad. It’s more that I will never, ever know when to bow, how deeply, or how many times.” There’s no book for that, you
just know it. It’s learned and it’s unconscious. You grow up that way.
How many of you have been to Algeria? At birth, every Algerian male is taken to the maternal village, where his smile muscles are
cut. Have you ever seen a smiling Algerian? They don’t smile.
Now, go down to Charleston, South Carolina, like I did a couple of months ago. I’m walking through the park there, a lovely, sunny
day and all the kids from the College of Charleston are out playing Frisbee and soccer and all of that. I’m walking up the path,
with two very striking young women coming toward me. They give me a big smile, and say a few nice words, and I think, “Wow, I’ve
still got it.” Then I realized that in Charleston everybody smiles and speaks to everybody: black, white, young, old. On their
license plates it says, “Smiling faces, Beautiful places.”
Those same two girls shouldn’t try that approach on the streets of New York City. One, it’s not going to work because no one’s going
to make eye contact. But, if anybody does, they’re going to make assumptions about what those two girls are up to. It’s a cultural
thing. It’s pervasive. Everybody does it like that. In Denmark, you smile, in Algeria, you don’t, but next door in Tunisia you do.
Cultural behavior is pervasive, it’s accepted, and it’s slow to change.
A brief digression about change. In America, we believe that not only is change possible, but it is good. There are other cultures
in this world where you don’t change things because God decreed them that way: “It is written.” If you’ve got a child with a
clubfoot and you’re really religious, you don’t take the child to an
orthopedic surgeon because God gave him that foot. As you know, in Hinduism, if you live properly you come back in the next life as
a Brahmin; if you don’t, you come back as a dung beetle.
Change is not something everybody accepts as being great, as we do. It’s not a question of right or wrong, it’s a question of
cultural perception. Culture reflects every aspect of group behavior, of what’s important to that culture—their beliefs, their
attitudes, their behavioral norms, their outlook, and their acceptance of both change and differences.
Now, the point of all this is not to say that one culture is good and another is bad, but when cultures come into contact with each
other, there can be problems in communications and behavior. But if one culture is attempting to impose itself on another, the
problems are magnified greatly.
Let’s just talk briefly about cultural generalizations. Everybody eats. That is a universal function. Some people eat out of a group
bowl. If you’ve never done that, it’s quite an experience. Somebody in the dim light of a tent out in the desert hands you part of a
sheep that you’re quite certain you’ve never eaten before, and may never even have seen before.
Some people use a knife, fork, and spoon. Some use chopsticks or fingers. There is kosher for Jews, and halal, the same thing, but
for Muslims. No meat, or no meat on Friday. Very hot spices in Thailand, or rotted fish in Norway. You get family style, adults
first, fast food. Everyone should accept that people may eat differently, but they don’t because the right way is their way.
You can only see 10 percent of a culture, the part that’s visible. The problems, the potential problems, are in the 90 percent that
you cannot see. You can see how people dress—a bikini, an abayah, a skullcap, whatever. You can see their gestures (which can be
highly misleading), facial expressions, public behavior, leisure activities, and so much more. This is all visible, but you may not
really understand what you see.
I was living in Baghdad when the Ayatollah Khomeini came to power. Shortly after that, we got this telegraphic CIA assessment that
said specialists had been watching the Ayatollah on TV, and it was clear that he was dying and would not be around long enough to
worry about. They knew this because they saw no changes in his facial expression and no noticeable body movement: he just sat there.
But that’s the way Ayatollahs behave, in a very calm and motionless manner, and if you don’t know that you can leap to the
conclusion that he’s dying. Well, he may well have been, but that isn’t how you tell. The folks making the report did not understand
the cultural implications of being an Ayatollah.
How about Islamic headdress? Some women will wear the really severe covering, which looks like what nuns traditionally wear, and for
the same reason: to cover all the hair. Islamic headdress can also be merely a scarf, a kerchief that looks very much like the
babushka women wear in Russia, or Spain, or Argentina. It reflects how the wearer interprets what the Koran says.
You cannot see, for example, concepts of leadership. How a leader is expected to behave depends on the culture. Is he supposed to be
exactly like you, or does he get all kinds of deference and respect because he is the leader? You can’t have a real understanding of
how a leader is expected to behave in a foreign culture. It can be significantly different from what we expect. How about the
implications of history? I don’t need to go into any details here, but if you’re fooling with the Middle East, where almost every
country has been colonized, several of them more than once, they have a different perspective.
How about the importance of family? In the US, T-shirts say, “Be kind to your children. They will select your retirement home.” In
some other societies, you care for your parents until they die in your arms. We don’t do it that way here, but it is not a question
of good or bad, right or wrong, it’s just different. In the Middle East, for example, family is everything because of their cultural
orientation. They do things for their extended family that Americans don’t even consider to be useful, let alone important.
How about superior-subordinate relations? People understand, in their cultures, how that’s supposed to be done, whether collegially
or by a direct order. That’s also personality driven, of course. But you cannot see how it is they’re supposed to behave. I went
once to hear the president of Algeria make a speech on a hillside, and saw that policemen kept the crowd back by using three-foot
sticks with three-foot knotted leather thongs. They kept the pressure off the people standing in the front rows by smacking people
in the rows farther back right across the face. You would not want to try that in societies that are not accustomed to that sort of
How do you define justice? It depends. Should it be a slap on the wrist or 30 lashes? Do you cut off the head or use an electric
chair? And what constitutes a really serious crime? You have no way of knowing, because you cannot see that part of a culture.
How about the work ethic? We always laugh because, in some parts of the world, people don’t seem to be working as hard as Americans
do. We’ll come to some of that in just a moment. But you can’t see it. What’s the definition of achievement? In America, it’s the
big house on the hill, the big car, the swimming pool. Or is it inner peace and nirvana, or the love of your family? What
constitutes being successful? Whatever it is, you cannot always see it.
Let’s go back up to the approach to problem solving. How many of you have been in Thailand, where they all seek consensus? I have
gone to Malaysia and to Thailand several times over the years, to teach courses for the Ministries of Foreign Affairs on Effective
Multilateral Negotiations using detailed role-play scenarios.
In Kuala Lumpur it worked well, in part because the population is diverse; roughly 1/3 ethnic Chinese, 1/3 Indian, and 1/3 Malay.
They are therefore good at role-playing and behave the way their instructions tell them to, so there is no way they can resolve the
problems laid out in the game. (That’s done on purpose, to make a point.) In Bangkok, where quiet, gentle people are all pretty much
of the same ethnicity, they quietly work on the problems and resolve them without contentious debate or raised voices.
IBM set up a special school in Armonk, New York, brought in IBMers from all their various countries to train an international team
that could go anywhere to work problems out. They had them engage in all sorts of team-building activities, and they discovered that
it didn’t work well because when they’d go to work on problems, culture kicked in: Brazilians, Americans, Swedes, and Germans would
argue their positions, but Japanese and Thais would sit quietly, because in their cultures you don’t behave that way.
Religious issues can be key determinants for behavior. Look at the role they’re playing in American domestic—and foreign—politics
right now. A number of the topics we perceive quite differently are basically religious questions.
How about appropriate behavior? There’s a tough one. Queen Victoria’s ambassador to Siam, going to the palace to present his
credentials, was accompanied by the chief of protocol. They came around a corner of the road, and there, across the field, bathing
in a stream, were a bunch of women with no clothing on. His excellency turned to the chief of protocol to ask if it wasn’t
considered rude for women to bathe naked in public. The reply was that it was considered rude to look at women who have taken off
their clothes to bathe naked in public.
How about the handling of emotions? Is it okay to cry? Is it okay to scream? Is it okay to yell and shriek? You can’t really tell
what the person’s feelings are unless you understand what the rules are in that culture for handling and displaying emotions.
How about competition versus cooperation? When I went to Officer Candidate School, just after World War II, there were a lot of
veterans in the class. They told us rookies there were two ways to get through this school, eliminate or cooperate, and that we were
going to cooperate. Some people don’t see it like that and conclude that if they can get rid of another, they have a better chance.
How about the meaning of friendship? What does it really mean? How about such critical issues as rules for gender interaction? You
don’t know if it’s really a foreign culture. I was part of the training team for a federalized National Guard brigade getting ready
to go to Iraq. A number of officers who had been in Iraq were there to help prepare the new guys, and they repeatedly stressed the
importance of never, never touching the women—unless you’re a woman. Otherwise you leave indelible scars because you break key
cultural taboos without even thinking about it.
If you’ve been there, you know that Brazilians prefer to stand closer to each other than Americans do. So you’ll see people at
parties slowly moving around the room, as the Brazilian tries to get closer and the American tries to get farther away. It’s like a
slow dance.
How about notions of modesty? Can you picture high school boys in Saudi Arabia saying, “Man, did you see the earlobe on that girl?”
An earlobe, compared to what happens here. Which is more demeaning to a woman, to require her to cover herself completely or to put
her photograph in a magazine in a position that’s usually reserved for gynecologists? It’s a question of culture.
How about status? You’ve got to understand that overseas, in other parts of the world, and even in some parts of our own country,
these things make a real difference, and you can’t see it. At the National Foreign Affairs Training Center two months ago, a young
student came up to say that she had just been assigned to Baghdad. She asked what she would have to do to really understand the
importance and relative standing of families and tribes there. I told her that was easy: all you have to do is be born and raised
there. Otherwise, you’re never going to know where to place a Brahimi or an Aduri. Age can give a person a great deal of status in a
society, so it may not be a good idea to push old folks around.
These are issues about which you know nothing, really. Situations may arise in which you can make major, unfortunate mistakes
without knowing any better. Culture controls perception. Your culture, without you necessarily even being aware of it, is what
determines how you perceive things. And perception controls everything else. You know this. Everything you do in your life is based
upon your perception of what is the right thing to do. It doesn’t mean you’re going to be right; you may be wrong. You can also be
afraid, and you can be coerced. But perception determines what you will do.
Perception is how you choose a hairstyle, a car color, a necktie, a spouse. Somebody else comes along and asks why in the world you
picked that necktie—or spouse. Their perception may be different from yours. But perception is reality; all you have to work with is
what you perceive. That is largely a function of the culture in which you were born, in which you were raised, or in which you are
You know, verbal exchanges can cause problems, because there are different meanings in languages. You have misconceptions and/or
false cognates. Those of you who speak Spanish know that the word embarasada means pregnant, not embarrassed. And you get
unfortunate connections, when you turn to your Indian colleague and say, “Why that company is a real cash cow.” There are subjects
that you just do not raise.
Here is the result of a very massive series of studies that were done by people who know far more about this business than I do. And
they came up with five categories of issues to think about culturally.
Figure 1
The first one is Structure and Power in the culture, as seen in Figure 1. On the left, you have low dependence needs, inequality is
minimized, and you don’t need/want much structure. You can see where the United States fits. Hierarchy is useful in a military
organization, for example. Superiors are accessible. People have equal rights, and you get change by evolution. Now, at the other
end of the scale there are high dependence needs where inequality is accepted, and hierarchy is needed/wanted. One of the things the
culture wants is somebody in charge who tells people what to do. Superiors are inaccessible. Power equals privilege. Change is done
through revolution.
Here is a scale from low at left, high on the right. Look where the United States is in terms of these issues. Here’s Iraq and
there’s Malaysia all the way to the right. There’s a big difference in the way Americans as a cultural group perceive these
issues as compared to Iraqis—or Malaysians. They are far more comfortable with strict leadership than we are. They accept—this is
all relative you understand—that power gives privilege. We accept it much less willingly. This is where cultural issues can become
serious, for example, when it involves military actions and occupation.
Figure 2
Let’s take a look at the very important second set of issues seen in Figure 2: Collectivism versus Individualism. On the left is
collectivism, where people are “we” conscious. They value relationships over task completion. They’re concerned about group
obligations, so that you lose face and you’re ashamed if you have failed to do something. On the right is Individualism, the “I”
conscious. Guess where we fit? In our country, it’s “I,” and over there, in Thailand for example, it’s “we.” In the United States,
private opinions are acceptable. And we have obligations to the self, to the individual. You lose self-respect, which is different
from shame, if you fail. On the scale, there’s Iraq and there’s America, with major differences in how the two cultures perceive
collectivism and individualism. It makes a difference in the way people behave and a big difference in the way they interact.
The third category, Task and Achievement (Figure 3), will interest you, I think. Quality of life and service are important to the
people who are on the left side. They strive for consensus and work in order to live. Small and slow is good, and there is sympathy
for the unfortunate. Men’s and women’s roles overlap. On the right side, task orientation and ambition to excel is the goal, and
that’s much more important than it is on the other side. You live in order to work. Big and fast
is good. Admiration for the achiever, men’s and women’s roles are separate. So here is the scale. You won’t be surprised to see
Japan out there at the right end. And Iraq and the United States are not that far apart in this particular category of orientation.
Figure 3
Uncertainty Avoidance is the fourth category (see FIgure 4). This is a major cultural issue, folks. On the left, we see that hard
work by itself is not necessarily a virtue in a situation in which people are fairly relaxed in terms of uncertainty avoidance.
Emotions, you don’t show much. You get a lot more passive expressions. Competition is good. They will accept dissent, and they are
willing to take risks. Few rules are needed. On the right side, you’ve got an inner urge to work. You’re prepared to show emotions.
Conflict is considered threatening. You have a need for consensus. You try to avoid failure; you have a need for rules and laws.
Once again, the United States and Iraq are not that far apart. Singapore is very low and Greece is at the high end. It’s
interesting, if you’ve been to those two countries, to keep this in mind when you deal with their people.
The fifth facet is Confucian Dynamism and is seen in Figure 5. They never completed this particular part of the study in the Arab
world, but it’s nonetheless interesting. On the left you have a belief in absolute truth, a pragmatic approach, and planning for the
near term. You accept change and you expect results. You spend for today. On the other side, you’ve got many truths, traditionalism
is more important than pragmatism, you plan long-term, stability is wanted, you persevere, and save for the future. And there is the
Figure 4
Figure 5
The thing you might want to bear in mind, at this stage, is to understand that in every culture or subculture, its members believe
strongly that theirs is the best one, the right one. When they have contact with other cultures, they still believe that theirs is
the right one, the best one. And if they’ve had extensive contacts, they
know that theirs is the best one and the right one. And from time to time, they may undertake efforts to convince others, one way or
another, that theirs is the right one. It’s called ethnocentrism and merely means that people tend to see things that way because
they’re part of that culture.
Now, cultural awareness. You know, cultures may create differences. Some of these differences are really very critical. Some of them
are discernible. You can see them, you’re aware of them. Others you are unaware of, even though they may be significantly more
important and meaningful. Some are predictable. Awareness helps to reduce or avoid problems and to increase benefits.
Now, let’s talk a little about Iraq in general terms. The individual and the family are far more important there because they
haven’t had a nation for very long (see Figure 6). And it consists of significantly diverse ethnic, religious, and linguistic
groups, which have not developed yet the feeling of nationhood that we have here. But think back to the time when a man named Robert
E. Lee said, “I am forced to give my sword to Virginia.” That’s the way it was here only 150 years ago. You fought for the state.
And that’s what the War of Northern Aggression was all about, in a sense. The idea of fighting for a state is probably a little less
prominent today than it was in the days of the Civil War.
Figure 6
In this same category, it is useful to remember and consider the fact that the Koran, unlike the Bible, covers every aspect of life:
social, cultural, political, and economic. Second, no one has ever welcomed an occupation. What’s the difference
between a liberator and an occupier? It kind of depends on which side you’re on. We are liberators, but some people in Iraq see us
as occupiers. The difference is perception, strictly, only, always.
Figure 7
Perception is everything. If you lose sight of that, so much of what we want to do in the world, as individuals and as a nation, is
going to become infinitely more difficult to accomplish. There is no requirement that you change a policy, or abandon a policy, or
modify a policy. But the point is this: If you choose to pretend that other people may not have differing perceptions, or worse, if
you choose to ignore that they clearly do, you are merely making it that much harder to get to wherever you’re trying to go, that
much harder to achieve your objective. Awareness of differing perceptions is something that isn’t always as necessary within the
culture as it is cross-culturally, especially when you’re a liberator or occupier. We know without equivocation that our way is the
best way, but other people may not agree. That does not make them right, but it helps explain what’s going on.
In the mid 80s, I was the deputy director of the Reagan White House Cabinet Task Force on Terrorism. This was in the days of the
Achille Lauro, TWA 847, the Baader-Meinhof gang, the Red Army Brigades, the Sendero Luminoso, all kinds of terrorism all around the
We met with Vice President George H. W. Bush, the task force chairman, to get our marching orders. He said we had carte blanche to
go into every aspect of terrorism—except one: “Don’t worry about causes.” You could feel the atmosphere
in that room change. And that is exactly where we are today.
Today we are told, endlessly, that they hate us because we have freedoms. I personally find that an insult to my intelligence. Why
in the world would anybody hate us because we have freedoms? There are a lot of people out there who envy our successes, and some of
them may resent our excesses. But nobody is going to kill and die for that. There are some people, however, who are prepared to
consider killing or dying because, from their perception, we are responsible for their people dying and being killed, indirectly in
Palestine for the last 50 years, and directly in Iraq for the last 14. And they don’t like it. It doesn’t make them right, but
that’s the problem. If you want to deal with terrorism you must, however painful, consider what some of the causes might be to
determine whether or not something could or should be done. And our nation still refuses to do it.
In November 1990, after the United Nations passed the Iraq embargo resolution, President Bush said, “The embargo will remain in
place until the people of Iraq get rid of Saddam Hussein.” That’s what it was for, to make life so intolerable for the Iraqi people
that they would rise up against Saddam. Two problems with that. One is that they couldn’t: marches on the palace in Baghdad are
extremely short, and you’re only around for one. Second, many people didn’t want to because they considered Saddam to be an OK guy.
Think about this: No leader in the world has ever been as loved, admired, revered, and respected as he liked to think he was; no
leader in the world has ever been as hated, despised, and detested as his enemies liked to think he was. Proof, the day before
September 11th, President Bush had an approval rating of 54 percent. Twenty-four hours later it was at 96 percent. What had
happened? When the nation is under attack, you rally behind the leader, even if you don’t like him. And that didn’t happen in Iraq?
You bet your life it did.
Leslie Stahl went to Iraq with her 60 Minutes crew in May 1996, four months before the Oil for Food program went into effect, when
the embargo was still total. One of the things the Iraqis could not import was chlorine, the vital ingredient in sewage treatment
and water purification. In addition, we had destroyed the Baghdad power grid in 1991, rendering the sewage treatment plants and
water purification plants inoperative, so raw sewage flowed directly into the Tigris and came right out again into the water
distribution system.
And the people of Baghdad, in the millions, were drinking seriously contaminated water. A bad case of simple diarrhea can kill a
child, but the children in Baghdad, suffering from massive gastro enteric infestations of a violent, virulent kind, were dying in
droves. Stahl talks to British, UN, French, and American doctors, then
she comes back to New York and interviews American Ambassador to the United Nations, Madeline Albright.
Stahl then says, “We have heard that a half a million children have died. That’s more children than died in Hiroshima. Is the price
worth it?” Albright’s answer, “I think this is a very hard choice. But the price, we think the price is worth it.”
That’s the coldest thing you ever heard in your life. The death of a half-million children is worth it. It is not a slip of the
tongue, because she then goes on and explains why it’s worth it. This interview was shown in this country once. But it has been
shown overseas hundreds of times, especially in the Middle East. And if you’ve never seen it, then it’s more difficult to understand
why some people are unhappy with our policies. If you don’t think that got some people pretty upset with us, then you don’t
understand human nature.
I went to El Salvador with two members of the Terrorism Task Force Working Group, where four Marine guards had been killed a couple
of months before. We were standing across the street from the embassy, and the embassy’s security officer said, “Ambassador Peck,
gentlemen, the embassy you see there is invulnerable to an attack by anything less than a field army.” I turned to the Navy SEAL, a
captain, and I said, “Lou, your job is to get the American Ambassador, and we’ve just found out the embassy is invulnerable. What’re
you going to do now, big guy?” He said, “Gosh, I guess we’ll have to wait until he comes out.” And the Marine colonel said, “In the
meantime, which way is the American school?”
You want to play games with terrorists, homegrown or otherwise? There’s no way in the world you can totally defend yourself against
them. What you need to consider is what we might be doing to generate this kind of problem. If there are such things, the question
is whether you can or want to do something to fix it. If we choose to ignore the evidence that’s laid out before us, or should be
laid out before us, then we will be left facing the consequences.
Let me ask two questions, quickly. Peace and security, my definition, means that the parties to the dispute, whatever it is, are
sufficiently satisfied with the resolution of that dispute and that any small groups which are not satisfied (and you can’t please
all of the people all of the time) are either marginalized or, at a minimum, not supported. Now, on the basis of that definition,
raise your hand if you agree with me that the world in general, and the Middle East in particular, will be a better place when
Israel and her neighbors are living in peace and security. OK, raise your hand again if you are of the opinion that the current
policies of the Israeli government will lead that nation to peace and security among her neighbors. And there’s the problem: you
can’t talk about this, despite the fact that everyone recognizes that you cannot get there from here. It’s not going to work.
It distresses me when I hear people saying, “What we’re doing in Iraq is going to lead to a spread of democracy all over the
region.” Yeah, unless you stop to think that there are two democracies actively at work in the Middle East, busily violating every
precept of law and rule that they insist is important: the United States in Iraq and the Israelis in Palestine, with our extensive
help. Our actions there are not going to leave people fully satisfied with the way we behave.
They don’t hate us; they hate our policies. In the same way, we bombed and killed Iraqis, not because we hated them but because we
didn’t like Saddam’s policies. But America is not the problem: it’s not who we are that they reject, but what we do. And over there,
we are doing a lot. That does not mean that we are wrong or evil. From our cultural perspective, from our government’s perspective,
we’re doing the right thing. But that perception is not the same on the other side. This causes problems.
As the global hyperpower, we can do whatever we want, wherever we want to do it, and whenever. And we cannot be stopped, even if
they work together. But there are small groups, and it doesn’t take many, who will look around for ways to make us sorry we did it.
They have, and they can, and they are, and they will. And I hope I’m wrong. So, I’ll take questions.
Peck Question and Answer Session
Question: Mr. Ambassador, I would gather that one of the canards, one of the most recent canards, is that everything has changed
since 9/11. The world isn’t the same as it was. I would assume you would argue that, to the contrary, our perceptions of the world
have changed. The shock of 9/11 has just changed our perceptions of the world. Is that accurate?
Answer: I think that certainly is part of it. You know, the horror of 9/11, the real horror of it, was that we could see it.
December the 7th we saw afterward. So 9/11 went down, and the nation was justifiably horrified and shocked and stunned. And you look
around for some way to strike back at the people you’re going to go after. And the world changed largely because we decided it was
going to.
I’m now stepping into the realm of politics, for which I apologize in advance. If you have ever read Program for a New American
Century, the document written in the 90s by the people who now run the government, you know it says that with the demise of the
Soviet Union, it’s now time for us to run the world. Anyway, they all signed this document and are in positions of responsibility
now. (By the way, it’s on the web at NewAmericanCentury.org if you’re interested in that kind of thing.)
And it says in there that you start the process in Iraq, which becomes the base from which we accomplish three objectives: control
the flow of oil, guarantee Israel’s security, and start a program of regime change throughout the region. Now that last part is
guaranteed to generate respect and admiration by our friends in the Middle East. Regime change, right.
If we had contented ourselves with Afghanistan, the world would not have changed so dramatically. But you just invaded Iraq for no
reasonable reason that anybody’s been able to produce, and you’re in there doing things to the Iraqis that they don’t appreciate. I
was on CNN a couple of months ago, and one of the moderators asked what I would do in Iraq. I said I would get out, and he said,
“You can’t get out. There would be chaos.” I waited a moment and asked, “What do you have now? Chaos with us killing them and them
killing us. Every day you stay it’s going to get worse, because they’re not going to accept it.” How do I prove this to you?
Northern Ireland. And they’re all Christians up there. How long has that been going on? 200 years? Hey, you don’t do it like this.
It doesn’t work, history shows you, without equivocation. Unless you kill them all.
Colonel [David] Hackworth (USA, Retired), writes good books, novels. He and I were on television once, and he said, only partially
jesting, “The solution for Iraq is simple. Kill them all, make it a parking lot. Problem solved.” I said, “Okay,
two conditions. One, you better make damn sure you’ve killed them all. Second, you better make absolutely certain you’ve killed
everybody who is unhappy that you killed them all. Then your problem is solved, not before.” You just cannot do it like that.
Question: Sir, in the past, and it seems in the present as well, Americans have conceived of nation building frequently in
ethnocentric terms. I wondered if you could comment. Do you think it’s possible for Americans to do nation building without
ethnocentrism, and what might a nation building program. . .if it’s possible to do. . .what might it look like?
Answer: Those are powerful, heavy questions. Let me see. I was down in Sarasota, Florida, talking to 600 people in the Institute of
Lifelong Learning. Somebody asked, “In your opinion, how long will it be before Afghanistan has a fully functioning democratic
government?” And I had one of those podium epiphanies. I said, “How many of you in this audience, you’re all well-to-do, you’re all
retired, you’re all educated people, how many of you are fully comfortable using a cell phone?” Fifteen hands went up, several of
them slowly. I said, “Think about this. A cell phone is a piece of hardware which you can hold in your hand, and it comes with a
beautifully detailed instruction book that tells you precisely how to make it work. But you’re not comfortable using it because
you’re not used to it. People of my generation look at a cell phone with the same level of comprehension a squid looks at a nuclear
submarine. When I use my cell phone, when I remember to take it with me—and remember to turn it on, I do it with my index finger,
and my kids laugh because you’re supposed to do it with your thumb.
Now, democracy is not a piece of hardware. There is no instruction book. It’s psychological, it’s historical, it’s philosophical,
it’s experiential. How long will it be before the Afghanis have a functioning democracy? It could be days. They don’t even know what
you’re talking about. And further, here is a key point to consider: Who says that that’s the best way to do things? Who says it’s
the only way to do things? Think about this. Democracy has become our nation’s secular religion. We are prepared, if necessary, for
conversion by the sword. You will be democratic.
Ladies, gentlemen, by definition, you cannot impose democracy. An imposed democracy is a dictatorship. You can’t force people into a
democracy. To think so is ethnocentrism carried to a high degree, in the sense that we know that democracy is the best way. It works
for us, but that’s our way. It doesn’t mean that they have to go for this. And remember that, in Islam, the church is the state. The
Koran covers all of this. So, when we come running in, pushing for separation of church and state, they say, “Whoa, whoa, God says
this is the way it’s supposed to be, and you’re bringing us something that human beings have created. We’ll take God’s
way first.” So I think that this is massively ethnocentric.
We want the Palestinians, for example, to have new elections because we do not accept the guy they elected. On 24 June 2002, the
President of the United States said the Palestinians have to have new elections and choose anybody they want, except Arafat. What
kind of democracy is that? Can Saddam run in Iraq? Absolutely not.
We are dealing with issues that are so far beyond our canon, our experience, that it’s difficult to understand. Americans, unless
you’re a Native American, you all came from somewhere else, and you left behind your village hatreds and memories. Americans don’t
understand why people butcher each other for possession of some stony hillside with a couple of trees on it—because that was my
great-great-great grandfather’s until his great-great-great grandfather took it away, and now we’re going to get it back. How can
you tell the difference between a Bosnian and a Croatian or a Serb? They know, they can tell, because they live there.
Question: Mr. Ambassador, I’ve enjoyed your talk very much, and there’s a great deal you’ve said that I agree with, but there are a
couple of points that are troubling me. One is that you’ve really implied rather strongly that the major causes of terrorism
directed against the United States are our actions in the world. I have a little bit of a hard time fully accepting that, because
having read a little bit, and I’m much less of an expert than you are I’m sure, but having read a little bit in the writings of
Zawahiri and some of the things that Khomeini has written, these people were identifying us as the Great Satan and the seducer of
the Muslims, and the epitome of all that is evil, and something that needs to be targeted and attacked. And, in Sayad Kudib’s case,
long before we had anything like the sort of dramatic impact and footprint in the Middle East that we’ve had now. In Khomeini’s
case, not primarily in response to the sorts of things you had been describing, but primarily, I think, in response to what we had
been doing in Iran. I’m not going to hold that up as something that was extremely praiseworthy, but I am going to say that the
situation seems to me a little bit more complicated than that we support Israel, and Israel does bad things to the Palestinians. We
invade Iraq, therefore these guys don’t like us and otherwise it would be okay. Because there does seem to be a rather well
developed strand of ideological thought that has played a powerful role in generating these terrorist movements against us and in
supporting them as they continue. It’s not clear to me that that would go away if we simply stopped doing the things that they
complain about. And a couple of things in there that bother me. First of all, the French, who have been steadfastly opposing us at
every turn and attempting to mitigate our influence in the Middle East and generally supporting the Palestinians and not supporting
the Israelis, nevertheless had two reporters taken hostage and threatened with beheading because they imposed a ban
on headscarves in France. And this leads me to the question, it may be that things that we do are going to bother these people, but
can we really afford to allow their prejudices and desires to edit what we do in the world to such an extent, because after all,
they are representative of a tiny fringe as well? That’s the main question I want to pose to you, but I want to tack one other thing
on. As a member of the project of the New American Century group that put that report together, I think you’ve simplified it a
little bit; and I would also like to clarify that virtually none of the people in senior positions in the administration today
played any significant role in the formation of that document. Some of them signed it, but virtually none of them played any
important role, and virtually none of them, in fact, came to any of the meetings. So it is absolutely a myth. By the way, neither
did they implement about 99 percent of the things that were proposed in that report. It is absolutely a myth that that report has
been the blueprint that the neocon conspiracy took into Washington and that has guided all of our actions ever since.
Answer: You may be entirely correct. Three things, Dr. Kagan. Returning the compliment, I was very impressed with your
presentations. And I was grossly oversimplifying. We only have a little bit of time here. If I had a whole college course, I could
do a better job. And I’m trying to lay out some points. Let me start with something else. It is perfectly clear to me that there are
in all kinds of groups—what’s the medical phrase?—“nut cases” who are prepared to do nasty things to someone because of something
that his group has done. This is in the field of religion, surely. The Iranians have some feeling that we may have had a hand in
getting rid of the people and putting the shah back on the throne. And, yes, it turns out that we did. And the Iranians remember
this. The Iranians remember the CIA’s involvement in the overthrow of Mossadegh and putting the shah in power and why we did that.
It was because of oil . . . they say. So they remember this.
I was on NBC with Tom Brokaw one night, and he said to me, “Why would the Iraqis launch this unprovoked scud-missile attack on
Israel?” And I said, “Well, whatever else it may be, it is not unprovoked.” He said, “What do you mean?” I said, “Well, 10 years
ago, Israel bombed the reactor in Baghdad. Now, we may have forgotten about that, but the Iraqis haven’t. Because it happened to
them. I’m not justifying it. You can call it retaliation, but it’s not unprovoked because they were already bombed. And Americans
have forgotten about this.
So, if you look at the Middle East, where we have been propping up harsh regimes, where we have been participating in the
suppression of an occupied people in Palestine, providing the arms and the money, they don’t like that. And their reaction is, why
are those people doing that to our people?
Nobody’s attacking Ecuador, as far as I’m aware. People are not launching 86
bombs on Australia. But the Americans are out there doing things, directly and indirectly, to the residents that those residents
perceive as being hostile. And maybe even hostile to their religion. You know, a person who wraps himself in the flag of Islam and
goes and blows himself up is violating Islam, if you’ve read the Koran. But, we are on the verge, I’m afraid, of making this into a
religious war. And if you do that, and you bear in mind that there are a billion and a half Muslims in this world, things do not
bode well for peace, harmony, justice, and the growth of free trade and free-market economies.
Question: I wonder if there’s a phony dichotomy between who we are and what we do. Because at the point where people take up arms
against you and become suicide bombers, they have been committed to a position that isn’t going to be changed by reform. The only
thing that’s going to change them is elimination. But there will continue to be people recruited into that, in the long run, if
there are not reforms. Consequently, you have to have a long-term policy of reform, a short-term policy of restraint toward these
populations, and then a focused ruthlessness on those who are attacking you. I don’t see any other alternative than that. People who
are that committed do, indeed, hate you for who you are. It has become an issue of their form or their distortion of Islam. It’s
there in the writings. I don’t know how you deny that. On the other hand, how in the world can you turn off the spigot that turns
out these people without the kinds of reforms that you’re talking about and that I particularly would feel are essential.
Answer: Not too long ago, this Palestinian woman blew herself up in one of the little seaside cities in Israel. She blew herself up.
She was a lawyer. The people in Jenin told us about her. She lost her husband and her brother in the Israeli incursion. They were
killed. Six or seven weeks afterward, her aged father, who lived with her, had a heart attack, and he died at the checkpoint as she
tried to get out of the city to the hospital. Because the people wouldn’t let her through. I’ve got to tell you, if you had to go
through those checkpoints several times a day, you’d be a little steamed. But this woman lost it all. Essentially she said, “You’re
going to die for this.” And she didn’t attack the people who did this to her; she attacked the people she could get to, which is
what folks do in this kind of business.
I do not want anything bad to happen to the state of Israel. I don’t want bad things to happen to us, but I think they will. That’s
part of it. So if you look carefully at the situation, you might decide that, well, maybe we shouldn’t be doing this. But if you
don’t want to look at the issues, then you can’t even consider the question of continuing or changing a policy.
In the Middle East, they see us as hostile and they have proof of it all through the area—now in Iraq and in Palestine. That’s going
to motivate some people to
become aberrational—that’s the word we’d have to use. These people are worthy of being gotten rid of, if you can figure out who they
are beforehand. But you can’t.
Question: I’d like to compliment you on most of what you’ve said today. I think the emphasis on cultural differences is extremely
valuable. But I think it needs a couple of caveats. I’ve always held as a principle that facts never speak for themselves. There’s
always a ventriloquist. And, in part, we see, especially in an age of media-driven demagoguery, that certain aspects of culture can
be emphasized. Milosevic was one of the prime examples. You had very considerable intermarriage among Serbs, Croatians, Bosnians,
Muslims, Christians within Bosnia, et cetera. You had a society that was moving in one direction, and Milosevic playing on one part
of the culture helped to push it very hard in another direction. Let me suggest, also, that our own experience in the American
south, things that were seen as immutable in American southern culture vanished within an amazingly short time, in part thanks to
political leadership, in part thanks to media, in part thanks to education, in part thanks simply to the pressures of cold reality.
So I think one of our real tasks is to almost understand the prayer of St. Francis, to know what cannot be changed, but also to know
what can be changed, and how to do it.
Answer: I agree with you totally, sir. Yet, there are some people who are die-hards who don’t let go. That’s why this idea of let’s
find these people and take them out . . . Who are they? Some of them are just growing up. You remember what one Serb said when they
accused him of killing all these little Croatians in Bosnia. He said, “Kill them when they’re young. It’s much easier. They don’t
get a chance to grow up.” This is bloody stuff. Americans have a hard time understanding it. How can they possibly feel that way?
They do, and they’re driven by things which may not even be anything more than class hatred or ethnic hatred. We, on the other hand,
are doing physically measurable, discernible things, which I do not think are in our interests.
In closing, I do suggest that the cultural differences I started with are so vast, and so profound, and so serious that you ignore
them at your peril. Now, some of you guys in uniform are still doing what I used to do. I enjoyed that trip very much. My years in
the Army and my years in the civilian service of my country. I envy you your opportunities to go on down this path. I’ve already
completed the trip. Enjoy it. Thank you very much for your attention.

=?UTF-8?Q?=29?=
Feel free to point out mistakes, coverups, and confusion.  Help us track down anyone who did bad things on purpose.  It's even fine
to try to shame those who thought they were doing the right thing but completely failed.
But it is useless and counterproductive to think this way: "USA, you have an extremely large debt to the world."  When the US makes
blatant mistakes, or even if not a mistake but was involved in destroying part of a country, often there is a lot done to rebuild. But you can't expect that reliably or too far.
At every point, nearly everyone could make a long list of those who have "an extremely large debt to the world": Germany & Japan,
British Empire, Medieval Europe, Genghis Khan, Romans, Greeks, various Middle East hordes, etc.  Every country that has had a civil
war likely has at least two groups that hold a grudge at least a little: the US does, even long after everyone involved is long dead.
The problem is that the people you are upset with are retired, senile, dead, etc.  The current population won't take kindly to being
accused too much for the present day opinions of decisions a generation or two ago.  Or, in the US, even the last administration. You'll have to learn to be happy with positive progress or live with the consequences.  This is what the US has to do with others
all the time.  If payment for slights and costs from the US perspective were extracted at US market rates, quite a portion of the
world would be indentured in some way.
In spite of what might be seen as mistakes, ignorant meddling, etc., by most measures and by enough people, the US has been a
positive force.  So there is a perception of plenty of offset overall.  Sure you can argue that, and for some it hasn't been true. But there are some broad scale effects that are true positive factors.  Any group that has a healthy culture and engages in peaceful
commerce does really, really well: Japan, China, Europe, India, Singapore, South Korea, etc.  It is likely that you can pretty much
rank the economic and cultural success of countries by how friendly they are with the US and US allies.
Those that want to keep trying to get revenge or combat whatever modernism force they don't like generally get squashed like a bug. No amount of bug bites is going to stop the US: That's only going to make the hive madder and occasionally more reckless.  And
eventually more effective and asymmetrical at quashing.  If you truly think anything will affect US dominance, you are not very well
aware of reality.  You can argue whatever details you like, but it really boils down to this: The most effective culture wins.  The
US (and, largely, other modern Western democracies) is an engine for rapidly improving culture while preventing runaway disasters. If any culture worked better than the US (as some did in the past compared to the immature US), the US would effectively adopt their
innovations or create better innovations to equal or supersede them.
Because the US pretty much shares everything with everyone, all friendly societies win too.  Stay outside of that group because you
think you have a better approach, but you don't really, and you just fall behind.  You might point to China as a holdout which is
doing fine.  But really, they are already very well on their way to converging.  They're taking their own path, unevenly absorbing
modernism, playing at military strength etc.  But that's all show, style, and face. iPhones and Androids alone will keep everyone
friendly.  This is just my opinion from partial information: Russia is having a little bump, and may regress, but the path will be
irresistible for them too.  Their oligarchy phase (like the US robber baron and organized crime phases combined in the modern era)
shows pretty much where they were on the evolutionary track in that era.  The gap between Russia and the West is tiny compared to
the West and ISIS/ISIL.
That desire to strike back scratches an itch for a few grudge holders while making a much larger group unhappy or dead, and then
breeding more grudge holders.
Are you sure you want your life's purpose to be the propagation of that stupidity?

only try to find a way forward.
Noticed this document today.  The article on page 77, /The Critical Role of Cultural Orientation/, is excellent.
The Critical Role of Cultural Orientation
Edward L. Peck
I have been asked to speak on the subject of culture, and the title I have chosen is “The Shock of Foreign Cultures—Especially
Yours.” Yours may seem as strange to them as theirs may seem to you. No surprise there, but think about cultures and subcultures for
a second. In my terminology, they are the result of multiple inputs on groups of people over a period of time. You learn, in the
home, the neighborhood, the military, the State Department, as an American, as an Ethiopian, whatever, how it is you’re supposed to
Let’s just take religion. Religious beliefs will impact on the way you and your subculture see things. This is an important point to
bear in mind. If there are 4,321 recognized religions in this world—and you should be aware that most, I think it’s about 86.213
percent, verbalized statistics are made up on the spot—if there are 4,321 recognized religions, then 4,320 of them are wrong.
Because they can’t all be right, can they? Well, mine is and yours isn’t. Religion is going to make a difference.
How about history? Think about Iraq for just a moment. The British occupation ended in 1932, which means that there are living
Iraqis who remember what an occupation is. And don’t forget that they were occupied for almost 400 years before that by the Turks.
So they’ve been there; this has been done to them. When you talk about occupation to those folks, they know what you’re talking
about. It’s part of their cultural history, which is why our president, a year ago, apologized for using the word “crusade” in
talking about our activities in the Middle East. Out there they know what that is, even though it was 1,000 years ago. In the
Crusades, as some of you may remember, the Christians came down from Europe and killed every Muslim and Jew they could lay their
hands on, plus any Christians that weren’t Christian enough.
Now, the people of the Middle East have not forgotten. If you go down to Birmingham or Savannah, they will talk to you, very
heatedly, about something they call the War of Northern Aggression. That was 150 years ago, but they have not forgotten it. And it
has an impact on how they see things, because history, even though it didn’t happen to you personally, is one of the things that
affects your view of things.
How about languages? The word jihad in Arabic means “struggle.” It does not mean holy war. You can call it holy war, but that’s not
what the word means. How about the political system? Whether it’s a titular head, whether it’s a king, whether it’s a democracy. How
about the economy and how you’re living?
How about such things as prejudice? Now, this is not a dirty word, you understand. It merely means making a decision before you have
all the facts. Anyone guilty of that over the last 48 hours raise your hand. Prejudice is going to color how people see things. So
will class structure, or the lack thereof. So will education, or the lack thereof. All of these things, and the family, and
geography, affect how cultures interact—their attitudes, their values, their behavior. These things are terribly important when you
go to really different cultures.
Cultural behavior is learned. Nobody teaches you this stuff. How come we all do the “V” for Victory this way? How come you don’t do
it palm in? Because you learned to do it palm out. Winston Churchill brought us this gesture in World War II, and the reason he did
it palm out is that, in the United Kingdom doing it palm in is an obscene gesture. You don’t need to know that; everybody does it
the same way, and only that way. It’s a cultural thing.
My oldest son has lived in Tokyo for 20 years. He says, “It’s not my skin or eye color or face that makes me remember I’m a
foreigner, Dad. It’s more that I will never, ever know when to bow, how deeply, or how many times.” There’s no book for that, you
just know it. It’s learned and it’s unconscious. You grow up that way.
How many of you have been to Algeria? At birth, every Algerian male is taken to the maternal village, where his smile muscles are
cut. Have you ever seen a smiling Algerian? They don’t smile.
Now, go down to Charleston, South Carolina, like I did a couple of months ago. I’m walking through the park there, a lovely, sunny
day and all the kids from the College of Charleston are out playing Frisbee and soccer and all of that. I’m walking up the path,
with two very striking young women coming toward me. They give me a big smile, and say a few nice words, and I think, “Wow, I’ve
still got it.” Then I realized that in Charleston everybody smiles and speaks to everybody: black, white, young, old. On their
license plates it says, “Smiling faces, Beautiful places.”
Those same two girls shouldn’t try that approach on the streets of New York City. One, it’s not going to work because no one’s going
to make eye contact. But, if anybody does, they’re going to make assumptions about what those two girls are up to. It’s a cultural
thing. It’s pervasive. Everybody does it like that. In Denmark, you smile, in Algeria, you don’t, but next door in Tunisia you do.
Cultural behavior is pervasive, it’s accepted, and it’s slow to change.
A brief digression about change. In America, we believe that not only is change possible, but it is good. There are other cultures
in this world where you don’t change things because God decreed them that way: “It is written.” If you’ve got a child with a
clubfoot and you’re really religious, you don’t take the child to an
orthopedic surgeon because God gave him that foot. As you know, in Hinduism, if you live properly you come back in the next life as
a Brahmin; if you don’t, you come back as a dung beetle.
Change is not something everybody accepts as being great, as we do. It’s not a question of right or wrong, it’s a question of
cultural perception. Culture reflects every aspect of group behavior, of what’s important to that culture—their beliefs, their
attitudes, their behavioral norms, their outlook, and their acceptance of both change and differences.
Now, the point of all this is not to say that one culture is good and another is bad, but when cultures come into contact with each
other, there can be problems in communications and behavior. But if one culture is attempting to impose itself on another, the
problems are magnified greatly.
Let’s just talk briefly about cultural generalizations. Everybody eats. That is a universal function. Some people eat out of a group
bowl. If you’ve never done that, it’s quite an experience. Somebody in the dim light of a tent out in the desert hands you part of a
sheep that you’re quite certain you’ve never eaten before, and may never even have seen before.
Some people use a knife, fork, and spoon. Some use chopsticks or fingers. There is kosher for Jews, and halal, the same thing, but
for Muslims. No meat, or no meat on Friday. Very hot spices in Thailand, or rotted fish in Norway. You get family style, adults
first, fast food. Everyone should accept that people may eat differently, but they don’t because the right way is their way.
You can only see 10 percent of a culture, the part that’s visible. The problems, the potential problems, are in the 90 percent that
you cannot see. You can see how people dress—a bikini, an abayah, a skullcap, whatever. You can see their gestures (which can be
highly misleading), facial expressions, public behavior, leisure activities, and so much more. This is all visible, but you may not
really understand what you see.
I was living in Baghdad when the Ayatollah Khomeini came to power. Shortly after that, we got this telegraphic CIA assessment that
said specialists had been watching the Ayatollah on TV, and it was clear that he was dying and would not be around long enough to
worry about. They knew this because they saw no changes in his facial expression and no noticeable body movement: he just sat there.
But that’s the way Ayatollahs behave, in a very calm and motionless manner, and if you don’t know that you can leap to the
conclusion that he’s dying. Well, he may well have been, but that isn’t how you tell. The folks making the report did not understand
the cultural implications of being an Ayatollah.
How about Islamic headdress? Some women will wear the really severe covering, which looks like what nuns traditionally wear, and for
the same reason: to cover all the hair. Islamic headdress can also be merely a scarf, a kerchief that looks very much like the
babushka women wear in Russia, or Spain, or Argentina. It reflects how the wearer interprets what the Koran says.
You cannot see, for example, concepts of leadership. How a leader is expected to behave depends on the culture. Is he supposed to be
exactly like you, or does he get all kinds of deference and respect because he is the leader? You can’t have a real understanding of
how a leader is expected to behave in a foreign culture. It can be significantly different from what we expect. How about the
implications of history? I don’t need to go into any details here, but if you’re fooling with the Middle East, where almost every
country has been colonized, several of them more than once, they have a different perspective.
How about the importance of family? In the US, T-shirts say, “Be kind to your children. They will select your retirement home.” In
some other societies, you care for your parents until they die in your arms. We don’t do it that way here, but it is not a question
of good or bad, right or wrong, it’s just different. In the Middle East, for example, family is everything because of their cultural
orientation. They do things for their extended family that Americans don’t even consider to be useful, let alone important.
How about superior-subordinate relations? People understand, in their cultures, how that’s supposed to be done, whether collegially
or by a direct order. That’s also personality driven, of course. But you cannot see how it is they’re supposed to behave. I went
once to hear the president of Algeria make a speech on a hillside, and saw that policemen kept the crowd back by using three-foot
sticks with three-foot knotted leather thongs. They kept the pressure off the people standing in the front rows by smacking people
in the rows farther back right across the face. You would not want to try that in societies that are not accustomed to that sort of
How do you define justice? It depends. Should it be a slap on the wrist or 30 lashes? Do you cut off the head or use an electric
chair? And what constitutes a really serious crime? You have no way of knowing, because you cannot see that part of a culture.
How about the work ethic? We always laugh because, in some parts of the world, people don’t seem to be working as hard as Americans
do. We’ll come to some of that in just a moment. But you can’t see it. What’s the definition of achievement? In America, it’s the
big house on the hill, the big car, the swimming pool. Or is it inner peace and nirvana, or the love of your family? What
constitutes being successful? Whatever it is, you cannot always see it.
Let’s go back up to the approach to problem solving. How many of you have been in Thailand, where they all seek consensus? I have
gone to Malaysia and to Thailand several times over the years, to teach courses for the Ministries of Foreign Affairs on Effective
Multilateral Negotiations using detailed role-play scenarios.
In Kuala Lumpur it worked well, in part because the population is diverse; roughly 1/3 ethnic Chinese, 1/3 Indian, and 1/3 Malay.
They are therefore good at role-playing and behave the way their instructions tell them to, so there is no way they can resolve the
problems laid out in the game. (That’s done on purpose, to make a point.) In Bangkok, where quiet, gentle people are all pretty much
of the same ethnicity, they quietly work on the problems and resolve them without contentious debate or raised voices.
IBM set up a special school in Armonk, New York, brought in IBMers from all their various countries to train an international team
that could go anywhere to work problems out. They had them engage in all sorts of team-building activities, and they discovered that
it didn’t work well because when they’d go to work on problems, culture kicked in: Brazilians, Americans, Swedes, and Germans would
argue their positions, but Japanese and Thais would sit quietly, because in their cultures you don’t behave that way.
Religious issues can be key determinants for behavior. Look at the role they’re playing in American domestic—and foreign—politics
right now. A number of the topics we perceive quite differently are basically religious questions.
How about appropriate behavior? There’s a tough one. Queen Victoria’s ambassador to Siam, going to the palace to present his
credentials, was accompanied by the chief of protocol. They came around a corner of the road, and there, across the field, bathing
in a stream, were a bunch of women with no clothing on. His excellency turned to the chief of protocol to ask if it wasn’t
considered rude for women to bathe naked in public. The reply was that it was considered rude to look at women who have taken off
their clothes to bathe naked in public.
How about the handling of emotions? Is it okay to cry? Is it okay to scream? Is it okay to yell and shriek? You can’t really tell
what the person’s feelings are unless you understand what the rules are in that culture for handling and displaying emotions.
How about competition versus cooperation? When I went to Officer Candidate School, just after World War II, there were a lot of
veterans in the class. They told us rookies there were two ways to get through this school, eliminate or cooperate, and that we were
going to cooperate. Some people don’t see it like that and conclude that if they can get rid of another, they have a better chance.
How about the meaning of friendship? What does it really mean? How about such critical issues as rules for gender interaction? You
don’t know if it’s really a foreign culture. I was part of the training team for a federalized National Guard brigade getting ready
to go to Iraq. A number of officers who had been in Iraq were there to help prepare the new guys, and they repeatedly stressed the
importance of never, never touching the women—unless you’re a woman. Otherwise you leave indelible scars because you break key
cultural taboos without even thinking about it.
If you’ve been there, you know that Brazilians prefer to stand closer to each other than Americans do. So you’ll see people at
parties slowly moving around the room, as the Brazilian tries to get closer and the American tries to get farther away. It’s like a
slow dance.
How about notions of modesty? Can you picture high school boys in Saudi Arabia saying, “Man, did you see the earlobe on that girl?”
An earlobe, compared to what happens here. Which is more demeaning to a woman, to require her to cover herself completely or to put
her photograph in a magazine in a position that’s usually reserved for gynecologists? It’s a question of culture.
How about status? You’ve got to understand that overseas, in other parts of the world, and even in some parts of our own country,
these things make a real difference, and you can’t see it. At the National Foreign Affairs Training Center two months ago, a young
student came up to say that she had just been assigned to Baghdad. She asked what she would have to do to really understand the
importance and relative standing of families and tribes there. I told her that was easy: all you have to do is be born and raised
there. Otherwise, you’re never going to know where to place a Brahimi or an Aduri. Age can give a person a great deal of status in a
society, so it may not be a good idea to push old folks around.
These are issues about which you know nothing, really. Situations may arise in which you can make major, unfortunate mistakes
without knowing any better. Culture controls perception. Your culture, without you necessarily even being aware of it, is what
determines how you perceive things. And perception controls everything else. You know this. Everything you do in your life is based
upon your perception of what is the right thing to do. It doesn’t mean you’re going to be right; you may be wrong. You can also be
afraid, and you can be coerced. But perception determines what you will do.
Perception is how you choose a hairstyle, a car color, a necktie, a spouse. Somebody else comes along and asks why in the world you
picked that necktie—or spouse. Their perception may be different from yours. But perception is reality; all you have to work with is
what you perceive. That is largely a function of the culture in which you were born, in which you were raised, or in which you are
You know, verbal exchanges can cause problems, because there are different meanings in languages. You have misconceptions and/or
false cognates. Those of you who speak Spanish know that the word embarasada means pregnant, not embarrassed. And you get
unfortunate connections, when you turn to your Indian colleague and say, “Why that company is a real cash cow.” There are subjects
that you just do not raise.
Here is the result of a very massive series of studies that were done by people who know far more about this business than I do. And
they came up with five categories of issues to think about culturally.
Figure 1
The first one is Structure and Power in the culture, as seen in Figure 1. On the left, you have low dependence needs, inequality is
minimized, and you don’t need/want much structure. You can see where the United States fits. Hierarchy is useful in a military
organization, for example. Superiors are accessible. People have equal rights, and you get change by evolution. Now, at the other
end of the scale there are high dependence needs where inequality is accepted, and hierarchy is needed/wanted. One of the things the
culture wants is somebody in charge who tells people what to do. Superiors are inaccessible. Power equals privilege. Change is done
through revolution.
Here is a scale from low at left, high on the right. Look where the United States is in terms of these issues. Here’s Iraq and
there’s Malaysia all the way to the right. There’s a big difference in the way Americans as a cultural group perceive these
issues as compared to Iraqis—or Malaysians. They are far more comfortable with strict leadership than we are. They accept—this is
all relative you understand—that power gives privilege. We accept it much less willingly. This is where cultural issues can become
serious, for example, when it involves military actions and occupation.
Figure 2
Let’s take a look at the very important second set of issues seen in Figure 2: Collectivism versus Individualism. On the left is
collectivism, where people are “we” conscious. They value relationships over task completion. They’re concerned about group
obligations, so that you lose face and you’re ashamed if you have failed to do something. On the right is Individualism, the “I”
conscious. Guess where we fit? In our country, it’s “I,” and over there, in Thailand for example, it’s “we.” In the United States,
private opinions are acceptable. And we have obligations to the self, to the individual. You lose self-respect, which is different
from shame, if you fail. On the scale, there’s Iraq and there’s America, with major differences in how the two cultures perceive
collectivism and individualism. It makes a difference in the way people behave and a big difference in the way they interact.
The third category, Task and Achievement (Figure 3), will interest you, I think. Quality of life and service are important to the
people who are on the left side. They strive for consensus and work in order to live. Small and slow is good, and there is sympathy
for the unfortunate. Men’s and women’s roles overlap. On the right side, task orientation and ambition to excel is the goal, and
that’s much more important than it is on the other side. You live in order to work. Big and fast
is good. Admiration for the achiever, men’s and women’s roles are separate. So here is the scale. You won’t be surprised to see
Japan out there at the right end. And Iraq and the United States are not that far apart in this particular category of orientation.
Figure 3
Uncertainty Avoidance is the fourth category (see FIgure 4). This is a major cultural issue, folks. On the left, we see that hard
work by itself is not necessarily a virtue in a situation in which people are fairly relaxed in terms of uncertainty avoidance.
Emotions, you don’t show much. You get a lot more passive expressions. Competition is good. They will accept dissent, and they are
willing to take risks. Few rules are needed. On the right side, you’ve got an inner urge to work. You’re prepared to show emotions.
Conflict is considered threatening. You have a need for consensus. You try to avoid failure; you have a need for rules and laws.
Once again, the United States and Iraq are not that far apart. Singapore is very low and Greece is at the high end. It’s
interesting, if you’ve been to those two countries, to keep this in mind when you deal with their people.
The fifth facet is Confucian Dynamism and is seen in Figure 5. They never completed this particular part of the study in the Arab
world, but it’s nonetheless interesting. On the left you have a belief in absolute truth, a pragmatic approach, and planning for the
near term. You accept change and you expect results. You spend for today. On the other side, you’ve got many truths, traditionalism
is more important than pragmatism, you plan long-term, stability is wanted, you persevere, and save for the future. And there is the
Figure 4
Figure 5
The thing you might want to bear in mind, at this stage, is to understand that in every culture or subculture, its members believe
strongly that theirs is the best one, the right one. When they have contact with other cultures, they still believe that theirs is
the right one, the best one. And if they’ve had extensive contacts, they
know that theirs is the best one and the right one. And from time to time, they may undertake efforts to convince others, one way or
another, that theirs is the right one. It’s called ethnocentrism and merely means that people tend to see things that way because
they’re part of that culture.
Now, cultural awareness. You know, cultures may create differences. Some of these differences are really very critical. Some of them
are discernible. You can see them, you’re aware of them. Others you are unaware of, even though they may be significantly more
important and meaningful. Some are predictable. Awareness helps to reduce or avoid problems and to increase benefits.
Now, let’s talk a little about Iraq in general terms. The individual and the family are far more important there because they
haven’t had a nation for very long (see Figure 6). And it consists of significantly diverse ethnic, religious, and linguistic
groups, which have not developed yet the feeling of nationhood that we have here. But think back to the time when a man named Robert
E. Lee said, “I am forced to give my sword to Virginia.” That’s the way it was here only 150 years ago. You fought for the state.
And that’s what the War of Northern Aggression was all about, in a sense. The idea of fighting for a state is probably a little less
prominent today than it was in the days of the Civil War.
Figure 6
In this same category, it is useful to remember and consider the fact that the Koran, unlike the Bible, covers every aspect of life:
social, cultural, political, and economic. Second, no one has ever welcomed an occupation. What’s the difference
between a liberator and an occupier? It kind of depends on which side you’re on. We are liberators, but some people in Iraq see us
as occupiers. The difference is perception, strictly, only, always.
Figure 7
Perception is everything. If you lose sight of that, so much of what we want to do in the world, as individuals and as a nation, is
going to become infinitely more difficult to accomplish. There is no requirement that you change a policy, or abandon a policy, or
modify a policy. But the point is this: If you choose to pretend that other people may not have differing perceptions, or worse, if
you choose to ignore that they clearly do, you are merely making it that much harder to get to wherever you’re trying to go, that
much harder to achieve your objective. Awareness of differing perceptions is something that isn’t always as necessary within the
culture as it is cross-culturally, especially when you’re a liberator or occupier. We know without equivocation that our way is the
best way, but other people may not agree. That does not make them right, but it helps explain what’s going on.
In the mid 80s, I was the deputy director of the Reagan White House Cabinet Task Force on Terrorism. This was in the days of the
Achille Lauro, TWA 847, the Baader-Meinhof gang, the Red Army Brigades, the Sendero Luminoso, all kinds of terrorism all around the
We met with Vice President George H. W. Bush, the task force chairman, to get our marching orders. He said we had carte blanche to
go into every aspect of terrorism—except one: “Don’t worry about causes.” You could feel the atmosphere
in that room change. And that is exactly where we are today.
Today we are told, endlessly, that they hate us because we have freedoms. I personally find that an insult to my intelligence. Why
in the world would anybody hate us because we have freedoms? There are a lot of people out there who envy our successes, and some of
them may resent our excesses. But nobody is going to kill and die for that. There are some people, however, who are prepared to
consider killing or dying because, from their perception, we are responsible for their people dying and being killed, indirectly in
Palestine for the last 50 years, and directly in Iraq for the last 14. And they don’t like it. It doesn’t make them right, but
that’s the problem. If you want to deal with terrorism you must, however painful, consider what some of the causes might be to
determine whether or not something could or should be done. And our nation still refuses to do it.
In November 1990, after the United Nations passed the Iraq embargo resolution, President Bush said, “The embargo will remain in
place until the people of Iraq get rid of Saddam Hussein.” That’s what it was for, to make life so intolerable for the Iraqi people
that they would rise up against Saddam. Two problems with that. One is that they couldn’t: marches on the palace in Baghdad are
extremely short, and you’re only around for one. Second, many people didn’t want to because they considered Saddam to be an OK guy.
Think about this: No leader in the world has ever been as loved, admired, revered, and respected as he liked to think he was; no
leader in the world has ever been as hated, despised, and detested as his enemies liked to think he was. Proof, the day before
September 11th, President Bush had an approval rating of 54 percent. Twenty-four hours later it was at 96 percent. What had
happened? When the nation is under attack, you rally behind the leader, even if you don’t like him. And that didn’t happen in Iraq?
You bet your life it did.
Leslie Stahl went to Iraq with her 60 Minutes crew in May 1996, four months before the Oil for Food program went into effect, when
the embargo was still total. One of the things the Iraqis could not import was chlorine, the vital ingredient in sewage treatment
and water purification. In addition, we had destroyed the Baghdad power grid in 1991, rendering the sewage treatment plants and
water purification plants inoperative, so raw sewage flowed directly into the Tigris and came right out again into the water
distribution system.
And the people of Baghdad, in the millions, were drinking seriously contaminated water. A bad case of simple diarrhea can kill a
child, but the children in Baghdad, suffering from massive gastro enteric infestations of a violent, virulent kind, were dying in
droves. Stahl talks to British, UN, French, and American doctors, then
she comes back to New York and interviews American Ambassador to the United Nations, Madeline Albright.
Stahl then says, “We have heard that a half a million children have died. That’s more children than died in Hiroshima. Is the price
worth it?” Albright’s answer, “I think this is a very hard choice. But the price, we think the price is worth it.”
That’s the coldest thing you ever heard in your life. The death of a half-million children is worth it. It is not a slip of the
tongue, because she then goes on and explains why it’s worth it. This interview was shown in this country once. But it has been
shown overseas hundreds of times, especially in the Middle East. And if you’ve never seen it, then it’s more difficult to understand
why some people are unhappy with our policies. If you don’t think that got some people pretty upset with us, then you don’t
understand human nature.
I went to El Salvador with two members of the Terrorism Task Force Working Group, where four Marine guards had been killed a couple
of months before. We were standing across the street from the embassy, and the embassy’s security officer said, “Ambassador Peck,
gentlemen, the embassy you see there is invulnerable to an attack by anything less than a field army.” I turned to the Navy SEAL, a
captain, and I said, “Lou, your job is to get the American Ambassador, and we’ve just found out the embassy is invulnerable. What’re
you going to do now, big guy?” He said, “Gosh, I guess we’ll have to wait until he comes out.” And the Marine colonel said, “In the
meantime, which way is the American school?”
You want to play games with terrorists, homegrown or otherwise? There’s no way in the world you can totally defend yourself against
them. What you need to consider is what we might be doing to generate this kind of problem. If there are such things, the question
is whether you can or want to do something to fix it. If we choose to ignore the evidence that’s laid out before us, or should be
laid out before us, then we will be left facing the consequences.
Let me ask two questions, quickly. Peace and security, my definition, means that the parties to the dispute, whatever it is, are
sufficiently satisfied with the resolution of that dispute and that any small groups which are not satisfied (and you can’t please
all of the people all of the time) are either marginalized or, at a minimum, not supported. Now, on the basis of that definition,
raise your hand if you agree with me that the world in general, and the Middle East in particular, will be a better place when
Israel and her neighbors are living in peace and security. OK, raise your hand again if you are of the opinion that the current
policies of the Israeli government will lead that nation to peace and security among her neighbors. And there’s the problem: you
can’t talk about this, despite the fact that everyone recognizes that you cannot get there from here. It’s not going to work.
It distresses me when I hear people saying, “What we’re doing in Iraq is going to lead to a spread of democracy all over the
region.” Yeah, unless you stop to think that there are two democracies actively at work in the Middle East, busily violating every
precept of law and rule that they insist is important: the United States in Iraq and the Israelis in Palestine, with our extensive
help. Our actions there are not going to leave people fully satisfied with the way we behave.
They don’t hate us; they hate our policies. In the same way, we bombed and killed Iraqis, not because we hated them but because we
didn’t like Saddam’s policies. But America is not the problem: it’s not who we are that they reject, but what we do. And over there,
we are doing a lot. That does not mean that we are wrong or evil. From our cultural perspective, from our government’s perspective,
we’re doing the right thing. But that perception is not the same on the other side. This causes problems.
As the global hyperpower, we can do whatever we want, wherever we want to do it, and whenever. And we cannot be stopped, even if
they work together. But there are small groups, and it doesn’t take many, who will look around for ways to make us sorry we did it.
They have, and they can, and they are, and they will. And I hope I’m wrong. So, I’ll take questions.
Peck Question and Answer Session
Question: Mr. Ambassador, I would gather that one of the canards, one of the most recent canards, is that everything has changed
since 9/11. The world isn’t the same as it was. I would assume you would argue that, to the contrary, our perceptions of the world
have changed. The shock of 9/11 has just changed our perceptions of the world. Is that accurate?
Answer: I think that certainly is part of it. You know, the horror of 9/11, the real horror of it, was that we could see it.
December the 7th we saw afterward. So 9/11 went down, and the nation was justifiably horrified and shocked and stunned. And you look
around for some way to strike back at the people you’re going to go after. And the world changed largely because we decided it was
going to.
I’m now stepping into the realm of politics, for which I apologize in advance. If you have ever read Program for a New American
Century, the document written in the 90s by the people who now run the government, you know it says that with the demise of the
Soviet Union, it’s now time for us to run the world. Anyway, they all signed this document and are in positions of responsibility
now. (By the way, it’s on the web at NewAmericanCentury.org if you’re interested in that kind of thing.)
And it says in there that you start the process in Iraq, which becomes the base from which we accomplish three objectives: control
the flow of oil, guarantee Israel’s security, and start a program of regime change throughout the region. Now that last part is
guaranteed to generate respect and admiration by our friends in the Middle East. Regime change, right.
If we had contented ourselves with Afghanistan, the world would not have changed so dramatically. But you just invaded Iraq for no
reasonable reason that anybody’s been able to produce, and you’re in there doing things to the Iraqis that they don’t appreciate. I
was on CNN a couple of months ago, and one of the moderators asked what I would do in Iraq. I said I would get out, and he said,
“You can’t get out. There would be chaos.” I waited a moment and asked, “What do you have now? Chaos with us killing them and them
killing us. Every day you stay it’s going to get worse, because they’re not going to accept it.” How do I prove this to you?
Northern Ireland. And they’re all Christians up there. How long has that been going on? 200 years? Hey, you don’t do it like this.
It doesn’t work, history shows you, without equivocation. Unless you kill them all.
Colonel [David] Hackworth (USA, Retired), writes good books, novels. He and I were on television once, and he said, only partially
jesting, “The solution for Iraq is simple. Kill them all, make it a parking lot. Problem solved.” I said, “Okay,
two conditions. One, you better make damn sure you’ve killed them all. Second, you better make absolutely certain you’ve killed
everybody who is unhappy that you killed them all. Then your problem is solved, not before.” You just cannot do it like that.
Question: Sir, in the past, and it seems in the present as well, Americans have conceived of nation building frequently in
ethnocentric terms. I wondered if you could comment. Do you think it’s possible for Americans to do nation building without
ethnocentrism, and what might a nation building program. . .if it’s possible to do. . .what might it look like?
Answer: Those are powerful, heavy questions. Let me see. I was down in Sarasota, Florida, talking to 600 people in the Institute of
Lifelong Learning. Somebody asked, “In your opinion, how long will it be before Afghanistan has a fully functioning democratic
government?” And I had one of those podium epiphanies. I said, “How many of you in this audience, you’re all well-to-do, you’re all
retired, you’re all educated people, how many of you are fully comfortable using a cell phone?” Fifteen hands went up, several of
them slowly. I said, “Think about this. A cell phone is a piece of hardware which you can hold in your hand, and it comes with a
beautifully detailed instruction book that tells you precisely how to make it work. But you’re not comfortable using it because
you’re not used to it. People of my generation look at a cell phone with the same level of comprehension a squid looks at a nuclear
submarine. When I use my cell phone, when I remember to take it with me—and remember to turn it on, I do it with my index finger,
and my kids laugh because you’re supposed to do it with your thumb.
Now, democracy is not a piece of hardware. There is no instruction book. It’s psychological, it’s historical, it’s philosophical,
it’s experiential. How long will it be before the Afghanis have a functioning democracy? It could be days. They don’t even know what
you’re talking about. And further, here is a key point to consider: Who says that that’s the best way to do things? Who says it’s
the only way to do things? Think about this. Democracy has become our nation’s secular religion. We are prepared, if necessary, for
conversion by the sword. You will be democratic.
Ladies, gentlemen, by definition, you cannot impose democracy. An imposed democracy is a dictatorship. You can’t force people into a
democracy. To think so is ethnocentrism carried to a high degree, in the sense that we know that democracy is the best way. It works
for us, but that’s our way. It doesn’t mean that they have to go for this. And remember that, in Islam, the church is the state. The
Koran covers all of this. So, when we come running in, pushing for separation of church and state, they say, “Whoa, whoa, God says
this is the way it’s supposed to be, and you’re bringing us something that human beings have created. We’ll take God’s
way first.” So I think that this is massively ethnocentric.
We want the Palestinians, for example, to have new elections because we do not accept the guy they elected. On 24 June 2002, the
President of the United States said the Palestinians have to have new elections and choose anybody they want, except Arafat. What
kind of democracy is that? Can Saddam run in Iraq? Absolutely not.
We are dealing with issues that are so far beyond our canon, our experience, that it’s difficult to understand. Americans, unless
you’re a Native American, you all came from somewhere else, and you left behind your village hatreds and memories. Americans don’t
understand why people butcher each other for possession of some stony hillside with a couple of trees on it—because that was my
great-great-great grandfather’s until his great-great-great grandfather took it away, and now we’re going to get it back. How can
you tell the difference between a Bosnian and a Croatian or a Serb? They know, they can tell, because they live there.
Question: Mr. Ambassador, I’ve enjoyed your talk very much, and there’s a great deal you’ve said that I agree with, but there are a
couple of points that are troubling me. One is that you’ve really implied rather strongly that the major causes of terrorism
directed against the United States are our actions in the world. I have a little bit of a hard time fully accepting that, because
having read a little bit, and I’m much less of an expert than you are I’m sure, but having read a little bit in the writings of
Zawahiri and some of the things that Khomeini has written, these people were identifying us as the Great Satan and the seducer of
the Muslims, and the epitome of all that is evil, and something that needs to be targeted and attacked. And, in Sayad Kudib’s case,
long before we had anything like the sort of dramatic impact and footprint in the Middle East that we’ve had now. In Khomeini’s
case, not primarily in response to the sorts of things you had been describing, but primarily, I think, in response to what we had
been doing in Iran. I’m not going to hold that up as something that was extremely praiseworthy, but I am going to say that the
situation seems to me a little bit more complicated than that we support Israel, and Israel does bad things to the Palestinians. We
invade Iraq, therefore these guys don’t like us and otherwise it would be okay. Because there does seem to be a rather well
developed strand of ideological thought that has played a powerful role in generating these terrorist movements against us and in
supporting them as they continue. It’s not clear to me that that would go away if we simply stopped doing the things that they
complain about. And a couple of things in there that bother me. First of all, the French, who have been steadfastly opposing us at
every turn and attempting to mitigate our influence in the Middle East and generally supporting the Palestinians and not supporting
the Israelis, nevertheless had two reporters taken hostage and threatened with beheading because they imposed a ban
on headscarves in France. And this leads me to the question, it may be that things that we do are going to bother these people, but
can we really afford to allow their prejudices and desires to edit what we do in the world to such an extent, because after all,
they are representative of a tiny fringe as well? That’s the main question I want to pose to you, but I want to tack one other thing
on. As a member of the project of the New American Century group that put that report together, I think you’ve simplified it a
little bit; and I would also like to clarify that virtually none of the people in senior positions in the administration today
played any significant role in the formation of that document. Some of them signed it, but virtually none of them played any
important role, and virtually none of them, in fact, came to any of the meetings. So it is absolutely a myth. By the way, neither
did they implement about 99 percent of the things that were proposed in that report. It is absolutely a myth that that report has
been the blueprint that the neocon conspiracy took into Washington and that has guided all of our actions ever since.
Answer: You may be entirely correct. Three things, Dr. Kagan. Returning the compliment, I was very impressed with your
presentations. And I was grossly oversimplifying. We only have a little bit of time here. If I had a whole college course, I could
do a better job. And I’m trying to lay out some points. Let me start with something else. It is perfectly clear to me that there are
in all kinds of groups—what’s the medical phrase?—“nut cases” who are prepared to do nasty things to someone because of something
that his group has done. This is in the field of religion, surely. The Iranians have some feeling that we may have had a hand in
getting rid of the people and putting the shah back on the throne. And, yes, it turns out that we did. And the Iranians remember
this. The Iranians remember the CIA’s involvement in the overthrow of Mossadegh and putting the shah in power and why we did that.
It was because of oil . . . they say. So they remember this.
I was on NBC with Tom Brokaw one night, and he said to me, “Why would the Iraqis launch this unprovoked scud-missile attack on
Israel?” And I said, “Well, whatever else it may be, it is not unprovoked.” He said, “What do you mean?” I said, “Well, 10 years
ago, Israel bombed the reactor in Baghdad. Now, we may have forgotten about that, but the Iraqis haven’t. Because it happened to
them. I’m not justifying it. You can call it retaliation, but it’s not unprovoked because they were already bombed. And Americans
have forgotten about this.
So, if you look at the Middle East, where we have been propping up harsh regimes, where we have been participating in the
suppression of an occupied people in Palestine, providing the arms and the money, they don’t like that. And their reaction is, why
are those people doing that to our people?
Nobody’s attacking Ecuador, as far as I’m aware. People are not launching 86
bombs on Australia. But the Americans are out there doing things, directly and indirectly, to the residents that those residents
perceive as being hostile. And maybe even hostile to their religion. You know, a person who wraps himself in the flag of Islam and
goes and blows himself up is violating Islam, if you’ve read the Koran. But, we are on the verge, I’m afraid, of making this into a
religious war. And if you do that, and you bear in mind that there are a billion and a half Muslims in this world, things do not
bode well for peace, harmony, justice, and the growth of free trade and free-market economies.
Question: I wonder if there’s a phony dichotomy between who we are and what we do. Because at the point where people take up arms
against you and become suicide bombers, they have been committed to a position that isn’t going to be changed by reform. The only
thing that’s going to change them is elimination. But there will continue to be people recruited into that, in the long run, if
there are not reforms. Consequently, you have to have a long-term policy of reform, a short-term policy of restraint toward these
populations, and then a focused ruthlessness on those who are attacking you. I don’t see any other alternative than that. People who
are that committed do, indeed, hate you for who you are. It has become an issue of their form or their distortion of Islam. It’s
there in the writings. I don’t know how you deny that. On the other hand, how in the world can you turn off the spigot that turns
out these people without the kinds of reforms that you’re talking about and that I particularly would feel are essential.
Answer: Not too long ago, this Palestinian woman blew herself up in one of the little seaside cities in Israel. She blew herself up.
She was a lawyer. The people in Jenin told us about her. She lost her husband and her brother in the Israeli incursion. They were
killed. Six or seven weeks afterward, her aged father, who lived with her, had a heart attack, and he died at the checkpoint as she
tried to get out of the city to the hospital. Because the people wouldn’t let her through. I’ve got to tell you, if you had to go
through those checkpoints several times a day, you’d be a little steamed. But this woman lost it all. Essentially she said, “You’re
going to die for this.” And she didn’t attack the people who did this to her; she attacked the people she could get to, which is
what folks do in this kind of business.
I do not want anything bad to happen to the state of Israel. I don’t want bad things to happen to us, but I think they will. That’s
part of it. So if you look carefully at the situation, you might decide that, well, maybe we shouldn’t be doing this. But if you
don’t want to look at the issues, then you can’t even consider the question of continuing or changing a policy.
In the Middle East, they see us as hostile and they have proof of it all through the area—now in Iraq and in Palestine. That’s going
to motivate some people to
become aberrational—that’s the word we’d have to use. These people are worthy of being gotten rid of, if you can figure out who they
are beforehand. But you can’t.
Question: I’d like to compliment you on most of what you’ve said today. I think the emphasis on cultural differences is extremely
valuable. But I think it needs a couple of caveats. I’ve always held as a principle that facts never speak for themselves. There’s
always a ventriloquist. And, in part, we see, especially in an age of media-driven demagoguery, that certain aspects of culture can
be emphasized. Milosevic was one of the prime examples. You had very considerable intermarriage among Serbs, Croatians, Bosnians,
Muslims, Christians within Bosnia, et cetera. You had a society that was moving in one direction, and Milosevic playing on one part
of the culture helped to push it very hard in another direction. Let me suggest, also, that our own experience in the American
south, things that were seen as immutable in American southern culture vanished within an amazingly short time, in part thanks to
political leadership, in part thanks to media, in part thanks to education, in part thanks simply to the pressures of cold reality.
So I think one of our real tasks is to almost understand the prayer of St. Francis, to know what cannot be changed, but also to know
what can be changed, and how to do it.
Answer: I agree with you totally, sir. Yet, there are some people who are die-hards who don’t let go. That’s why this idea of let’s
find these people and take them out . . . Who are they? Some of them are just growing up. You remember what one Serb said when they
accused him of killing all these little Croatians in Bosnia. He said, “Kill them when they’re young. It’s much easier. They don’t
get a chance to grow up.” This is bloody stuff. Americans have a hard time understanding it. How can they possibly feel that way?
They do, and they’re driven by things which may not even be anything more than class hatred or ethnic hatred. We, on the other hand,
are doing physically measurable, discernible things, which I do not think are in our interests.
In closing, I do suggest that the cultural differences I started with are so vast, and so profound, and so serious that you ignore
them at your peril. Now, some of you guys in uniform are still doing what I used to do. I enjoyed that trip very much. My years in
the Army and my years in the civilian service of my country. I envy you your opportunities to go on down this path. I’ve already
completed the trip. Enjoy it. Thank you very much for your attention.

=?UTF-8?Q?=29?=
Feel free to point out mistakes, coverups, and confusion.  Help us track down anyone who did bad things on purpose.  It's even fine
to try to shame those who thought they were doing the right thing but completely failed.
But it is useless and counterproductive to think this way: "USA, you have an extremely large debt to the world."  When the US makes
blatant mistakes, or even if not a mistake but was involved in destroying part of a country, often there is a lot done to rebuild. But you can't expect that reliably or too far.
At every point, nearly everyone could make a long list of those who have "an extremely large debt to the world": Germany & Japan,
British Empire, Medieval Europe, Genghis Khan, Romans, Greeks, various Middle East hordes, etc.  Every country that has had a civil
war likely has at least two groups that hold a grudge at least a little: the US does, even long after everyone involved is long dead.
The problem is that the people you are upset with are retired, senile, dead, etc.  The current population won't take kindly to being
accused too much for the present day opinions of decisions a generation or two ago.  Or, in the US, even the last administration. You'll have to learn to be happy with positive progress or live with the consequences.  This is what the US has to do with others
all the time.  If payment for slights and costs from the US perspective were extracted at US market rates, quite a portion of the
world would be indentured in some way.
In spite of what might be seen as mistakes, ignorant meddling, etc., by most measures and by enough people, the US has been a
positive force.  So there is a perception of plenty of offset overall.  Sure you can argue that, and for some it hasn't been true. But there are some broad scale effects that are true positive factors.  Any group that has a healthy culture and engages in peaceful
commerce does really, really well: Japan, China, Europe, India, Singapore, South Korea, etc.  It is likely that you can pretty much
rank the economic and cultural success of countries by how friendly they are with the US and US allies.
Those that want to keep trying to get revenge or combat whatever modernism force they don't like generally get squashed like a bug. No amount of bug bites is going to stop the US: That's only going to make the hive madder and occasionally more reckless.  And
eventually more effective and asymmetrical at quashing.  If you truly think anything will affect US dominance, you are not very well
aware of reality.  You can argue whatever details you like, but it really boils down to this: The most effective culture wins.  The
US (and, largely, other modern Western democracies) is an engine for rapidly improving culture while preventing runaway disasters. If any culture worked better than the US (as some did in the past compared to the immature US), the US would effectively adopt their
innovations or create better innovations to equal or supersede them.
Because the US pretty much shares everything with everyone, all friendly societies win too.  Stay outside of that group because you
think you have a better approach, but you don't really, and you just fall behind.  You might point to China as a holdout which is
doing fine.  But really, they are already very well on their way to converging.  They're taking their own path, unevenly absorbing
modernism, playing at military strength etc.  But that's all show, style, and face. iPhones and Androids alone will keep everyone
friendly.  This is just my opinion from partial information: Russia is having a little bump, and may regress, but the path will be
irresistible for them too.  Their oligarchy phase (like the US robber baron and organized crime phases combined in the modern era)
shows pretty much where they were on the evolutionary track in that era.  The gap between Russia and the West is tiny compared to
the West and ISIS/ISIL.
That desire to strike back scratches an itch for a few grudge holders while making a much larger group unhappy or dead, and then
breeding more grudge holders.
Are you sure you want your life's purpose to be the propagation of that stupidity?

Cool.  On the previous question of replicated email and mailman servers, I was recently looking into ways to do that.  Since all
email messages have unique IDs already, it isn't difficult to replicate messages at any point while avoiding duplicates and loops. I was concerned with Postfix, Dovecot (in mbox mode), and Mailman.  This is a link dump on that subject.  More stars mean more
promising / less obsolete:
* * ** * If people posted to the server that they are subscribed to and if servers accept email from subscribers including fully
authenticated other mailman servers, that would seem to work.  By not sending copies of posted messages back to the sender, the
originating mailman wouldn't get a second copy.  If the From was preserved in messages rather than a sister-mailman-ID, mailman
could still be made to be sure that it came from a trusted server.  A slight tweak to Mailman (or a procmail recipe) could support
signing the message or similar to indicate that it had been blessed on the sister system.  Or a sister-mailman ID could be used for
cross-mailman forwarding, with the original email ID in headers, possibly restored by a posting step.
I'd be fine running another node whenever someone wants to mess with it.  We should set up a test list to hack on it for a while. We ought to create a Docker or similar recipe for setting up a new node with a single step.

Keep in mind that key players in the US are trying to keep all of this in mind, learning from mistakes.  You cannot go back, you can
only try to find a way forward.
Noticed this document today.  The article on page 77, /The Critical Role of Cultural Orientation/, is excellent.
The Critical Role of Cultural Orientation
Edward L. Peck
I have been asked to speak on the subject of culture, and the title I have chosen is “The Shock of Foreign Cultures—Especially
Yours.” Yours may seem as strange to them as theirs may seem to you. No surprise there, but think about cultures and subcultures for
a second. In my terminology, they are the result of multiple inputs on groups of people over a period of time. You learn, in the
home, the neighborhood, the military, the State Department, as an American, as an Ethiopian, whatever, how it is you’re supposed to
Let’s just take religion. Religious beliefs will impact on the way you and your subculture see things. This is an important point to
bear in mind. If there are 4,321 recognized religions in this world—and you should be aware that most, I think it’s about 86.213
percent, verbalized statistics are made up on the spot—if there are 4,321 recognized religions, then 4,320 of them are wrong.
Because they can’t all be right, can they? Well, mine is and yours isn’t. Religion is going to make a difference.
How about history? Think about Iraq for just a moment. The British occupation ended in 1932, which means that there are living
Iraqis who remember what an occupation is. And don’t forget that they were occupied for almost 400 years before that by the Turks.
So they’ve been there; this has been done to them. When you talk about occupation to those folks, they know what you’re talking
about. It’s part of their cultural history, which is why our president, a year ago, apologized for using the word “crusade” in
talking about our activities in the Middle East. Out there they know what that is, even though it was 1,000 years ago. In the
Crusades, as some of you may remember, the Christians came down from Europe and killed every Muslim and Jew they could lay their
hands on, plus any Christians that weren’t Christian enough.
Now, the people of the Middle East have not forgotten. If you go down to Birmingham or Savannah, they will talk to you, very
heatedly, about something they call the War of Northern Aggression. That was 150 years ago, but they have not forgotten it. And it
has an impact on how they see things, because history, even though it didn’t happen to you personally, is one of the things that
affects your view of things.
How about languages? The word jihad in Arabic means “struggle.” It does not mean holy war. You can call it holy war, but that’s not
what the word means. How about the political system? Whether it’s a titular head, whether it’s a king, whether it’s a democracy. How
about the economy and how you’re living?
How about such things as prejudice? Now, this is not a dirty word, you understand. It merely means making a decision before you have
all the facts. Anyone guilty of that over the last 48 hours raise your hand. Prejudice is going to color how people see things. So
will class structure, or the lack thereof. So will education, or the lack thereof. All of these things, and the family, and
geography, affect how cultures interact—their attitudes, their values, their behavior. These things are terribly important when you
go to really different cultures.
Cultural behavior is learned. Nobody teaches you this stuff. How come we all do the “V” for Victory this way? How come you don’t do
it palm in? Because you learned to do it palm out. Winston Churchill brought us this gesture in World War II, and the reason he did
it palm out is that, in the United Kingdom doing it palm in is an obscene gesture. You don’t need to know that; everybody does it
the same way, and only that way. It’s a cultural thing.
My oldest son has lived in Tokyo for 20 years. He says, “It’s not my skin or eye color or face that makes me remember I’m a
foreigner, Dad. It’s more that I will never, ever know when to bow, how deeply, or how many times.” There’s no book for that, you
just know it. It’s learned and it’s unconscious. You grow up that way.
How many of you have been to Algeria? At birth, every Algerian male is taken to the maternal village, where his smile muscles are
cut. Have you ever seen a smiling Algerian? They don’t smile.
Now, go down to Charleston, South Carolina, like I did a couple of months ago. I’m walking through the park there, a lovely, sunny
day and all the kids from the College of Charleston are out playing Frisbee and soccer and all of that. I’m walking up the path,
with two very striking young women coming toward me. They give me a big smile, and say a few nice words, and I think, “Wow, I’ve
still got it.” Then I realized that in Charleston everybody smiles and speaks to everybody: black, white, young, old. On their
license plates it says, “Smiling faces, Beautiful places.”
Those same two girls shouldn’t try that approach on the streets of New York City. One, it’s not going to work because no one’s going
to make eye contact. But, if anybody does, they’re going to make assumptions about what those two girls are up to. It’s a cultural
thing. It’s pervasive. Everybody does it like that. In Denmark, you smile, in Algeria, you don’t, but next door in Tunisia you do.
Cultural behavior is pervasive, it’s accepted, and it’s slow to change.
A brief digression about change. In America, we believe that not only is change possible, but it is good. There are other cultures
in this world where you don’t change things because God decreed them that way: “It is written.” If you’ve got a child with a
clubfoot and you’re really religious, you don’t take the child to an
orthopedic surgeon because God gave him that foot. As you know, in Hinduism, if you live properly you come back in the next life as
a Brahmin; if you don’t, you come back as a dung beetle.
Change is not something everybody accepts as being great, as we do. It’s not a question of right or wrong, it’s a question of
cultural perception. Culture reflects every aspect of group behavior, of what’s important to that culture—their beliefs, their
attitudes, their behavioral norms, their outlook, and their acceptance of both change and differences.
Now, the point of all this is not to say that one culture is good and another is bad, but when cultures come into contact with each
other, there can be problems in communications and behavior. But if one culture is attempting to impose itself on another, the
problems are magnified greatly.
Let’s just talk briefly about cultural generalizations. Everybody eats. That is a universal function. Some people eat out of a group
bowl. If you’ve never done that, it’s quite an experience. Somebody in the dim light of a tent out in the desert hands you part of a
sheep that you’re quite certain you’ve never eaten before, and may never even have seen before.
Some people use a knife, fork, and spoon. Some use chopsticks or fingers. There is kosher for Jews, and halal, the same thing, but
for Muslims. No meat, or no meat on Friday. Very hot spices in Thailand, or rotted fish in Norway. You get family style, adults
first, fast food. Everyone should accept that people may eat differently, but they don’t because the right way is their way.
You can only see 10 percent of a culture, the part that’s visible. The problems, the potential problems, are in the 90 percent that
you cannot see. You can see how people dress—a bikini, an abayah, a skullcap, whatever. You can see their gestures (which can be
highly misleading), facial expressions, public behavior, leisure activities, and so much more. This is all visible, but you may not
really understand what you see.
I was living in Baghdad when the Ayatollah Khomeini came to power. Shortly after that, we got this telegraphic CIA assessment that
said specialists had been watching the Ayatollah on TV, and it was clear that he was dying and would not be around long enough to
worry about. They knew this because they saw no changes in his facial expression and no noticeable body movement: he just sat there.
But that’s the way Ayatollahs behave, in a very calm and motionless manner, and if you don’t know that you can leap to the
conclusion that he’s dying. Well, he may well have been, but that isn’t how you tell. The folks making the report did not understand
the cultural implications of being an Ayatollah.
How about Islamic headdress? Some women will wear the really severe covering, which looks like what nuns traditionally wear, and for
the same reason: to cover all the hair. Islamic headdress can also be merely a scarf, a kerchief that looks very much like the
babushka women wear in Russia, or Spain, or Argentina. It reflects how the wearer interprets what the Koran says.
You cannot see, for example, concepts of leadership. How a leader is expected to behave depends on the culture. Is he supposed to be
exactly like you, or does he get all kinds of deference and respect because he is the leader? You can’t have a real understanding of
how a leader is expected to behave in a foreign culture. It can be significantly different from what we expect. How about the
implications of history? I don’t need to go into any details here, but if you’re fooling with the Middle East, where almost every
country has been colonized, several of them more than once, they have a different perspective.
How about the importance of family? In the US, T-shirts say, “Be kind to your children. They will select your retirement home.” In
some other societies, you care for your parents until they die in your arms. We don’t do it that way here, but it is not a question
of good or bad, right or wrong, it’s just different. In the Middle East, for example, family is everything because of their cultural
orientation. They do things for their extended family that Americans don’t even consider to be useful, let alone important.
How about superior-subordinate relations? People understand, in their cultures, how that’s supposed to be done, whether collegially
or by a direct order. That’s also personality driven, of course. But you cannot see how it is they’re supposed to behave. I went
once to hear the president of Algeria make a speech on a hillside, and saw that policemen kept the crowd back by using three-foot
sticks with three-foot knotted leather thongs. They kept the pressure off the people standing in the front rows by smacking people
in the rows farther back right across the face. You would not want to try that in societies that are not accustomed to that sort of
How do you define justice? It depends. Should it be a slap on the wrist or 30 lashes? Do you cut off the head or use an electric
chair? And what constitutes a really serious crime? You have no way of knowing, because you cannot see that part of a culture.
How about the work ethic? We always laugh because, in some parts of the world, people don’t seem to be working as hard as Americans
do. We’ll come to some of that in just a moment. But you can’t see it. What’s the definition of achievement? In America, it’s the
big house on the hill, the big car, the swimming pool. Or is it inner peace and nirvana, or the love of your family? What
constitutes being successful? Whatever it is, you cannot always see it.
Let’s go back up to the approach to problem solving. How many of you have been in Thailand, where they all seek consensus? I have
gone to Malaysia and to Thailand several times over the years, to teach courses for the Ministries of Foreign Affairs on Effective
Multilateral Negotiations using detailed role-play scenarios.
In Kuala Lumpur it worked well, in part because the population is diverse; roughly 1/3 ethnic Chinese, 1/3 Indian, and 1/3 Malay.
They are therefore good at role-playing and behave the way their instructions tell them to, so there is no way they can resolve the
problems laid out in the game. (That’s done on purpose, to make a point.) In Bangkok, where quiet, gentle people are all pretty much
of the same ethnicity, they quietly work on the problems and resolve them without contentious debate or raised voices.
IBM set up a special school in Armonk, New York, brought in IBMers from all their various countries to train an international team
that could go anywhere to work problems out. They had them engage in all sorts of team-building activities, and they discovered that
it didn’t work well because when they’d go to work on problems, culture kicked in: Brazilians, Americans, Swedes, and Germans would
argue their positions, but Japanese and Thais would sit quietly, because in their cultures you don’t behave that way.
Religious issues can be key determinants for behavior. Look at the role they’re playing in American domestic—and foreign—politics
right now. A number of the topics we perceive quite differently are basically religious questions.
How about appropriate behavior? There’s a tough one. Queen Victoria’s ambassador to Siam, going to the palace to present his
credentials, was accompanied by the chief of protocol. They came around a corner of the road, and there, across the field, bathing
in a stream, were a bunch of women with no clothing on. His excellency turned to the chief of protocol to ask if it wasn’t
considered rude for women to bathe naked in public. The reply was that it was considered rude to look at women who have taken off
their clothes to bathe naked in public.
How about the handling of emotions? Is it okay to cry? Is it okay to scream? Is it okay to yell and shriek? You can’t really tell
what the person’s feelings are unless you understand what the rules are in that culture for handling and displaying emotions.
How about competition versus cooperation? When I went to Officer Candidate School, just after World War II, there were a lot of
veterans in the class. They told us rookies there were two ways to get through this school, eliminate or cooperate, and that we were
going to cooperate. Some people don’t see it like that and conclude that if they can get rid of another, they have a better chance.
How about the meaning of friendship? What does it really mean? How about such critical issues as rules for gender interaction? You
don’t know if it’s really a foreign culture. I was part of the training team for a federalized National Guard brigade getting ready
to go to Iraq. A number of officers who had been in Iraq were there to help prepare the new guys, and they repeatedly stressed the
importance of never, never touching the women—unless you’re a woman. Otherwise you leave indelible scars because you break key
cultural taboos without even thinking about it.
If you’ve been there, you know that Brazilians prefer to stand closer to each other than Americans do. So you’ll see people at
parties slowly moving around the room, as the Brazilian tries to get closer and the American tries to get farther away. It’s like a
slow dance.
How about notions of modesty? Can you picture high school boys in Saudi Arabia saying, “Man, did you see the earlobe on that girl?”
An earlobe, compared to what happens here. Which is more demeaning to a woman, to require her to cover herself completely or to put
her photograph in a magazine in a position that’s usually reserved for gynecologists? It’s a question of culture.
How about status? You’ve got to understand that overseas, in other parts of the world, and even in some parts of our own country,
these things make a real difference, and you can’t see it. At the National Foreign Affairs Training Center two months ago, a young
student came up to say that she had just been assigned to Baghdad. She asked what she would have to do to really understand the
importance and relative standing of families and tribes there. I told her that was easy: all you have to do is be born and raised
there. Otherwise, you’re never going to know where to place a Brahimi or an Aduri. Age can give a person a great deal of status in a
society, so it may not be a good idea to push old folks around.
These are issues about which you know nothing, really. Situations may arise in which you can make major, unfortunate mistakes
without knowing any better. Culture controls perception. Your culture, without you necessarily even being aware of it, is what
determines how you perceive things. And perception controls everything else. You know this. Everything you do in your life is based
upon your perception of what is the right thing to do. It doesn’t mean you’re going to be right; you may be wrong. You can also be
afraid, and you can be coerced. But perception determines what you will do.
Perception is how you choose a hairstyle, a car color, a necktie, a spouse. Somebody else comes along and asks why in the world you
picked that necktie—or spouse. Their perception may be different from yours. But perception is reality; all you have to work with is
what you perceive. That is largely a function of the culture in which you were born, in which you were raised, or in which you are
You know, verbal exchanges can cause problems, because there are different meanings in languages. You have misconceptions and/or
false cognates. Those of you who speak Spanish know that the word embarasada means pregnant, not embarrassed. And you get
unfortunate connections, when you turn to your Indian colleague and say, “Why that company is a real cash cow.” There are subjects
that you just do not raise.
Here is the result of a very massive series of studies that were done by people who know far more about this business than I do. And
they came up with five categories of issues to think about culturally.
Figure 1
The first one is Structure and Power in the culture, as seen in Figure 1. On the left, you have low dependence needs, inequality is
minimized, and you don’t need/want much structure. You can see where the United States fits. Hierarchy is useful in a military
organization, for example. Superiors are accessible. People have equal rights, and you get change by evolution. Now, at the other
end of the scale there are high dependence needs where inequality is accepted, and hierarchy is needed/wanted. One of the things the
culture wants is somebody in charge who tells people what to do. Superiors are inaccessible. Power equals privilege. Change is done
through revolution.
Here is a scale from low at left, high on the right. Look where the United States is in terms of these issues. Here’s Iraq and
there’s Malaysia all the way to the right. There’s a big difference in the way Americans as a cultural group perceive these
issues as compared to Iraqis—or Malaysians. They are far more comfortable with strict leadership than we are. They accept—this is
all relative you understand—that power gives privilege. We accept it much less willingly. This is where cultural issues can become
serious, for example, when it involves military actions and occupation.
Figure 2
Let’s take a look at the very important second set of issues seen in Figure 2: Collectivism versus Individualism. On the left is
collectivism, where people are “we” conscious. They value relationships over task completion. They’re concerned about group
obligations, so that you lose face and you’re ashamed if you have failed to do something. On the right is Individualism, the “I”
conscious. Guess where we fit? In our country, it’s “I,” and over there, in Thailand for example, it’s “we.” In the United States,
private opinions are acceptable. And we have obligations to the self, to the individual. You lose self-respect, which is different
from shame, if you fail. On the scale, there’s Iraq and there’s America, with major differences in how the two cultures perceive
collectivism and individualism. It makes a difference in the way people behave and a big difference in the way they interact.
The third category, Task and Achievement (Figure 3), will interest you, I think. Quality of life and service are important to the
people who are on the left side. They strive for consensus and work in order to live. Small and slow is good, and there is sympathy
for the unfortunate. Men’s and women’s roles overlap. On the right side, task orientation and ambition to excel is the goal, and
that’s much more important than it is on the other side. You live in order to work. Big and fast
is good. Admiration for the achiever, men’s and women’s roles are separate. So here is the scale. You won’t be surprised to see
Japan out there at the right end. And Iraq and the United States are not that far apart in this particular category of orientation.
Figure 3
Uncertainty Avoidance is the fourth category (see FIgure 4). This is a major cultural issue, folks. On the left, we see that hard
work by itself is not necessarily a virtue in a situation in which people are fairly relaxed in terms of uncertainty avoidance.
Emotions, you don’t show much. You get a lot more passive expressions. Competition is good. They will accept dissent, and they are
willing to take risks. Few rules are needed. On the right side, you’ve got an inner urge to work. You’re prepared to show emotions.
Conflict is considered threatening. You have a need for consensus. You try to avoid failure; you have a need for rules and laws.
Once again, the United States and Iraq are not that far apart. Singapore is very low and Greece is at the high end. It’s
interesting, if you’ve been to those two countries, to keep this in mind when you deal with their people.
The fifth facet is Confucian Dynamism and is seen in Figure 5. They never completed this particular part of the study in the Arab
world, but it’s nonetheless interesting. On the left you have a belief in absolute truth, a pragmatic approach, and planning for the
near term. You accept change and you expect results. You spend for today. On the other side, you’ve got many truths, traditionalism
is more important than pragmatism, you plan long-term, stability is wanted, you persevere, and save for the future. And there is the
Figure 4
Figure 5
The thing you might want to bear in mind, at this stage, is to understand that in every culture or subculture, its members believe
strongly that theirs is the best one, the right one. When they have contact with other cultures, they still believe that theirs is
the right one, the best one. And if they’ve had extensive contacts, they
know that theirs is the best one and the right one. And from time to time, they may undertake efforts to convince others, one way or
another, that theirs is the right one. It’s called ethnocentrism and merely means that people tend to see things that way because
they’re part of that culture.
Now, cultural awareness. You know, cultures may create differences. Some of these differences are really very critical. Some of them
are discernible. You can see them, you’re aware of them. Others you are unaware of, even though they may be significantly more
important and meaningful. Some are predictable. Awareness helps to reduce or avoid problems and to increase benefits.
Now, let’s talk a little about Iraq in general terms. The individual and the family are far more important there because they
haven’t had a nation for very long (see Figure 6). And it consists of significantly diverse ethnic, religious, and linguistic
groups, which have not developed yet the feeling of nationhood that we have here. But think back to the time when a man named Robert
E. Lee said, “I am forced to give my sword to Virginia.” That’s the way it was here only 150 years ago. You fought for the state.
And that’s what the War of Northern Aggression was all about, in a sense. The idea of fighting for a state is probably a little less
prominent today than it was in the days of the Civil War.
Figure 6
In this same category, it is useful to remember and consider the fact that the Koran, unlike the Bible, covers every aspect of life:
social, cultural, political, and economic. Second, no one has ever welcomed an occupation. What’s the difference
between a liberator and an occupier? It kind of depends on which side you’re on. We are liberators, but some people in Iraq see us
as occupiers. The difference is perception, strictly, only, always.
Figure 7
Perception is everything. If you lose sight of that, so much of what we want to do in the world, as individuals and as a nation, is
going to become infinitely more difficult to accomplish. There is no requirement that you change a policy, or abandon a policy, or
modify a policy. But the point is this: If you choose to pretend that other people may not have differing perceptions, or worse, if
you choose to ignore that they clearly do, you are merely making it that much harder to get to wherever you’re trying to go, that
much harder to achieve your objective. Awareness of differing perceptions is something that isn’t always as necessary within the
culture as it is cross-culturally, especially when you’re a liberator or occupier. We know without equivocation that our way is the
best way, but other people may not agree. That does not make them right, but it helps explain what’s going on.
In the mid 80s, I was the deputy director of the Reagan White House Cabinet Task Force on Terrorism. This was in the days of the
Achille Lauro, TWA 847, the Baader-Meinhof gang, the Red Army Brigades, the Sendero Luminoso, all kinds of terrorism all around the
We met with Vice President George H. W. Bush, the task force chairman, to get our marching orders. He said we had carte blanche to
go into every aspect of terrorism—except one: “Don’t worry about causes.” You could feel the atmosphere
in that room change. And that is exactly where we are today.
Today we are told, endlessly, that they hate us because we have freedoms. I personally find that an insult to my intelligence. Why
in the world would anybody hate us because we have freedoms? There are a lot of people out there who envy our successes, and some of
them may resent our excesses. But nobody is going to kill and die for that. There are some people, however, who are prepared to
consider killing or dying because, from their perception, we are responsible for their people dying and being killed, indirectly in
Palestine for the last 50 years, and directly in Iraq for the last 14. And they don’t like it. It doesn’t make them right, but
that’s the problem. If you want to deal with terrorism you must, however painful, consider what some of the causes might be to
determine whether or not something could or should be done. And our nation still refuses to do it.
In November 1990, after the United Nations passed the Iraq embargo resolution, President Bush said, “The embargo will remain in
place until the people of Iraq get rid of Saddam Hussein.” That’s what it was for, to make life so intolerable for the Iraqi people
that they would rise up against Saddam. Two problems with that. One is that they couldn’t: marches on the palace in Baghdad are
extremely short, and you’re only around for one. Second, many people didn’t want to because they considered Saddam to be an OK guy.
Think about this: No leader in the world has ever been as loved, admired, revered, and respected as he liked to think he was; no
leader in the world has ever been as hated, despised, and detested as his enemies liked to think he was. Proof, the day before
September 11th, President Bush had an approval rating of 54 percent. Twenty-four hours later it was at 96 percent. What had
happened? When the nation is under attack, you rally behind the leader, even if you don’t like him. And that didn’t happen in Iraq?
You bet your life it did.
Leslie Stahl went to Iraq with her 60 Minutes crew in May 1996, four months before the Oil for Food program went into effect, when
the embargo was still total. One of the things the Iraqis could not import was chlorine, the vital ingredient in sewage treatment
and water purification. In addition, we had destroyed the Baghdad power grid in 1991, rendering the sewage treatment plants and
water purification plants inoperative, so raw sewage flowed directly into the Tigris and came right out again into the water
distribution system.
And the people of Baghdad, in the millions, were drinking seriously contaminated water. A bad case of simple diarrhea can kill a
child, but the children in Baghdad, suffering from massive gastro enteric infestations of a violent, virulent kind, were dying in
droves. Stahl talks to British, UN, French, and American doctors, then
she comes back to New York and interviews American Ambassador to the United Nations, Madeline Albright.
Stahl then says, “We have heard that a half a million children have died. That’s more children than died in Hiroshima. Is the price
worth it?” Albright’s answer, “I think this is a very hard choice. But the price, we think the price is worth it.”
That’s the coldest thing you ever heard in your life. The death of a half-million children is worth it. It is not a slip of the
tongue, because she then goes on and explains why it’s worth it. This interview was shown in this country once. But it has been
shown overseas hundreds of times, especially in the Middle East. And if you’ve never seen it, then it’s more difficult to understand
why some people are unhappy with our policies. If you don’t think that got some people pretty upset with us, then you don’t
understand human nature.
I went to El Salvador with two members of the Terrorism Task Force Working Group, where four Marine guards had been killed a couple
of months before. We were standing across the street from the embassy, and the embassy’s security officer said, “Ambassador Peck,
gentlemen, the embassy you see there is invulnerable to an attack by anything less than a field army.” I turned to the Navy SEAL, a
captain, and I said, “Lou, your job is to get the American Ambassador, and we’ve just found out the embassy is invulnerable. What’re
you going to do now, big guy?” He said, “Gosh, I guess we’ll have to wait until he comes out.” And the Marine colonel said, “In the
meantime, which way is the American school?”
You want to play games with terrorists, homegrown or otherwise? There’s no way in the world you can totally defend yourself against
them. What you need to consider is what we might be doing to generate this kind of problem. If there are such things, the question
is whether you can or want to do something to fix it. If we choose to ignore the evidence that’s laid out before us, or should be
laid out before us, then we will be left facing the consequences.
Let me ask two questions, quickly. Peace and security, my definition, means that the parties to the dispute, whatever it is, are
sufficiently satisfied with the resolution of that dispute and that any small groups which are not satisfied (and you can’t please
all of the people all of the time) are either marginalized or, at a minimum, not supported. Now, on the basis of that definition,
raise your hand if you agree with me that the world in general, and the Middle East in particular, will be a better place when
Israel and her neighbors are living in peace and security. OK, raise your hand again if you are of the opinion that the current
policies of the Israeli government will lead that nation to peace and security among her neighbors. And there’s the problem: you
can’t talk about this, despite the fact that everyone recognizes that you cannot get there from here. It’s not going to work.
It distresses me when I hear people saying, “What we’re doing in Iraq is going to lead to a spread of democracy all over the
region.” Yeah, unless you stop to think that there are two democracies actively at work in the Middle East, busily violating every
precept of law and rule that they insist is important: the United States in Iraq and the Israelis in Palestine, with our extensive
help. Our actions there are not going to leave people fully satisfied with the way we behave.
They don’t hate us; they hate our policies. In the same way, we bombed and killed Iraqis, not because we hated them but because we
didn’t like Saddam’s policies. But America is not the problem: it’s not who we are that they reject, but what we do. And over there,
we are doing a lot. That does not mean that we are wrong or evil. From our cultural perspective, from our government’s perspective,
we’re doing the right thing. But that perception is not the same on the other side. This causes problems.
As the global hyperpower, we can do whatever we want, wherever we want to do it, and whenever. And we cannot be stopped, even if
they work together. But there are small groups, and it doesn’t take many, who will look around for ways to make us sorry we did it.
They have, and they can, and they are, and they will. And I hope I’m wrong. So, I’ll take questions.
Peck Question and Answer Session
Question: Mr. Ambassador, I would gather that one of the canards, one of the most recent canards, is that everything has changed
since 9/11. The world isn’t the same as it was. I would assume you would argue that, to the contrary, our perceptions of the world
have changed. The shock of 9/11 has just changed our perceptions of the world. Is that accurate?
Answer: I think that certainly is part of it. You know, the horror of 9/11, the real horror of it, was that we could see it.
December the 7th we saw afterward. So 9/11 went down, and the nation was justifiably horrified and shocked and stunned. And you look
around for some way to strike back at the people you’re going to go after. And the world changed largely because we decided it was
going to.
I’m now stepping into the realm of politics, for which I apologize in advance. If you have ever read Program for a New American
Century, the document written in the 90s by the people who now run the government, you know it says that with the demise of the
Soviet Union, it’s now time for us to run the world. Anyway, they all signed this document and are in positions of responsibility
now. (By the way, it’s on the web at NewAmericanCentury.org if you’re interested in that kind of thing.)
And it says in there that you start the process in Iraq, which becomes the base from which we accomplish three objectives: control
the flow of oil, guarantee Israel’s security, and start a program of regime change throughout the region. Now that last part is
guaranteed to generate respect and admiration by our friends in the Middle East. Regime change, right.
If we had contented ourselves with Afghanistan, the world would not have changed so dramatically. But you just invaded Iraq for no
reasonable reason that anybody’s been able to produce, and you’re in there doing things to the Iraqis that they don’t appreciate. I
was on CNN a couple of months ago, and one of the moderators asked what I would do in Iraq. I said I would get out, and he said,
“You can’t get out. There would be chaos.” I waited a moment and asked, “What do you have now? Chaos with us killing them and them
killing us. Every day you stay it’s going to get worse, because they’re not going to accept it.” How do I prove this to you?
Northern Ireland. And they’re all Christians up there. How long has that been going on? 200 years? Hey, you don’t do it like this.
It doesn’t work, history shows you, without equivocation. Unless you kill them all.
Colonel [David] Hackworth (USA, Retired), writes good books, novels. He and I were on television once, and he said, only partially
jesting, “The solution for Iraq is simple. Kill them all, make it a parking lot. Problem solved.” I said, “Okay,
two conditions. One, you better make damn sure you’ve killed them all. Second, you better make absolutely certain you’ve killed
everybody who is unhappy that you killed them all. Then your problem is solved, not before.” You just cannot do it like that.
Question: Sir, in the past, and it seems in the present as well, Americans have conceived of nation building frequently in
ethnocentric terms. I wondered if you could comment. Do you think it’s possible for Americans to do nation building without
ethnocentrism, and what might a nation building program. . .if it’s possible to do. . .what might it look like?
Answer: Those are powerful, heavy questions. Let me see. I was down in Sarasota, Florida, talking to 600 people in the Institute of
Lifelong Learning. Somebody asked, “In your opinion, how long will it be before Afghanistan has a fully functioning democratic
government?” And I had one of those podium epiphanies. I said, “How many of you in this audience, you’re all well-to-do, you’re all
retired, you’re all educated people, how many of you are fully comfortable using a cell phone?” Fifteen hands went up, several of
them slowly. I said, “Think about this. A cell phone is a piece of hardware which you can hold in your hand, and it comes with a
beautifully detailed instruction book that tells you precisely how to make it work. But you’re not comfortable using it because
you’re not used to it. People of my generation look at a cell phone with the same level of comprehension a squid looks at a nuclear
submarine. When I use my cell phone, when I remember to take it with me—and remember to turn it on, I do it with my index finger,
and my kids laugh because you’re supposed to do it with your thumb.
Now, democracy is not a piece of hardware. There is no instruction book. It’s psychological, it’s historical, it’s philosophical,
it’s experiential. How long will it be before the Afghanis have a functioning democracy? It could be days. They don’t even know what
you’re talking about. And further, here is a key point to consider: Who says that that’s the best way to do things? Who says it’s
the only way to do things? Think about this. Democracy has become our nation’s secular religion. We are prepared, if necessary, for
conversion by the sword. You will be democratic.
Ladies, gentlemen, by definition, you cannot impose democracy. An imposed democracy is a dictatorship. You can’t force people into a
democracy. To think so is ethnocentrism carried to a high degree, in the sense that we know that democracy is the best way. It works
for us, but that’s our way. It doesn’t mean that they have to go for this. And remember that, in Islam, the church is the state. The
Koran covers all of this. So, when we come running in, pushing for separation of church and state, they say, “Whoa, whoa, God says
this is the way it’s supposed to be, and you’re bringing us something that human beings have created. We’ll take God’s
way first.” So I think that this is massively ethnocentric.
We want the Palestinians, for example, to have new elections because we do not accept the guy they elected. On 24 June 2002, the
President of the United States said the Palestinians have to have new elections and choose anybody they want, except Arafat. What
kind of democracy is that? Can Saddam run in Iraq? Absolutely not.
We are dealing with issues that are so far beyond our canon, our experience, that it’s difficult to understand. Americans, unless
you’re a Native American, you all came from somewhere else, and you left behind your village hatreds and memories. Americans don’t
understand why people butcher each other for possession of some stony hillside with a couple of trees on it—because that was my
great-great-great grandfather’s until his great-great-great grandfather took it away, and now we’re going to get it back. How can
you tell the difference between a Bosnian and a Croatian or a Serb? They know, they can tell, because they live there.
Question: Mr. Ambassador, I’ve enjoyed your talk very much, and there’s a great deal you’ve said that I agree with, but there are a
couple of points that are troubling me. One is that you’ve really implied rather strongly that the major causes of terrorism
directed against the United States are our actions in the world. I have a little bit of a hard time fully accepting that, because
having read a little bit, and I’m much less of an expert than you are I’m sure, but having read a little bit in the writings of
Zawahiri and some of the things that Khomeini has written, these people were identifying us as the Great Satan and the seducer of
the Muslims, and the epitome of all that is evil, and something that needs to be targeted and attacked. And, in Sayad Kudib’s case,
long before we had anything like the sort of dramatic impact and footprint in the Middle East that we’ve had now. In Khomeini’s
case, not primarily in response to the sorts of things you had been describing, but primarily, I think, in response to what we had
been doing in Iran. I’m not going to hold that up as something that was extremely praiseworthy, but I am going to say that the
situation seems to me a little bit more complicated than that we support Israel, and Israel does bad things to the Palestinians. We
invade Iraq, therefore these guys don’t like us and otherwise it would be okay. Because there does seem to be a rather well
developed strand of ideological thought that has played a powerful role in generating these terrorist movements against us and in
supporting them as they continue. It’s not clear to me that that would go away if we simply stopped doing the things that they
complain about. And a couple of things in there that bother me. First of all, the French, who have been steadfastly opposing us at
every turn and attempting to mitigate our influence in the Middle East and generally supporting the Palestinians and not supporting
the Israelis, nevertheless had two reporters taken hostage and threatened with beheading because they imposed a ban
on headscarves in France. And this leads me to the question, it may be that things that we do are going to bother these people, but
can we really afford to allow their prejudices and desires to edit what we do in the world to such an extent, because after all,
they are representative of a tiny fringe as well? That’s the main question I want to pose to you, but I want to tack one other thing
on. As a member of the project of the New American Century group that put that report together, I think you’ve simplified it a
little bit; and I would also like to clarify that virtually none of the people in senior positions in the administration today
played any significant role in the formation of that document. Some of them signed it, but virtually none of them played any
important role, and virtually none of them, in fact, came to any of the meetings. So it is absolutely a myth. By the way, neither
did they implement about 99 percent of the things that were proposed in that report. It is absolutely a myth that that report has
been the blueprint that the neocon conspiracy took into Washington and that has guided all of our actions ever since.
Answer: You may be entirely correct. Three things, Dr. Kagan. Returning the compliment, I was very impressed with your
presentations. And I was grossly oversimplifying. We only have a little bit of time here. If I had a whole college course, I could
do a better job. And I’m trying to lay out some points. Let me start with something else. It is perfectly clear to me that there are
in all kinds of groups—what’s the medical phrase?—“nut cases” who are prepared to do nasty things to someone because of something
that his group has done. This is in the field of religion, surely. The Iranians have some feeling that we may have had a hand in
getting rid of the people and putting the shah back on the throne. And, yes, it turns out that we did. And the Iranians remember
this. The Iranians remember the CIA’s involvement in the overthrow of Mossadegh and putting the shah in power and why we did that.
It was because of oil . . . they say. So they remember this.
I was on NBC with Tom Brokaw one night, and he said to me, “Why would the Iraqis launch this unprovoked scud-missile attack on
Israel?” And I said, “Well, whatever else it may be, it is not unprovoked.” He said, “What do you mean?” I said, “Well, 10 years
ago, Israel bombed the reactor in Baghdad. Now, we may have forgotten about that, but the Iraqis haven’t. Because it happened to
them. I’m not justifying it. You can call it retaliation, but it’s not unprovoked because they were already bombed. And Americans
have forgotten about this.
So, if you look at the Middle East, where we have been propping up harsh regimes, where we have been participating in the
suppression of an occupied people in Palestine, providing the arms and the money, they don’t like that. And their reaction is, why
are those people doing that to our people?
Nobody’s attacking Ecuador, as far as I’m aware. People are not launching 86
bombs on Australia. But the Americans are out there doing things, directly and indirectly, to the residents that those residents
perceive as being hostile. And maybe even hostile to their religion. You know, a person who wraps himself in the flag of Islam and
goes and blows himself up is violating Islam, if you’ve read the Koran. But, we are on the verge, I’m afraid, of making this into a
religious war. And if you do that, and you bear in mind that there are a billion and a half Muslims in this world, things do not
bode well for peace, harmony, justice, and the growth of free trade and free-market economies.
Question: I wonder if there’s a phony dichotomy between who we are and what we do. Because at the point where people take up arms
against you and become suicide bombers, they have been committed to a position that isn’t going to be changed by reform. The only
thing that’s going to change them is elimination. But there will continue to be people recruited into that, in the long run, if
there are not reforms. Consequently, you have to have a long-term policy of reform, a short-term policy of restraint toward these
populations, and then a focused ruthlessness on those who are attacking you. I don’t see any other alternative than that. People who
are that committed do, indeed, hate you for who you are. It has become an issue of their form or their distortion of Islam. It’s
there in the writings. I don’t know how you deny that. On the other hand, how in the world can you turn off the spigot that turns
out these people without the kinds of reforms that you’re talking about and that I particularly would feel are essential.
Answer: Not too long ago, this Palestinian woman blew herself up in one of the little seaside cities in Israel. She blew herself up.
She was a lawyer. The people in Jenin told us about her. She lost her husband and her brother in the Israeli incursion. They were
killed. Six or seven weeks afterward, her aged father, who lived with her, had a heart attack, and he died at the checkpoint as she
tried to get out of the city to the hospital. Because the people wouldn’t let her through. I’ve got to tell you, if you had to go
through those checkpoints several times a day, you’d be a little steamed. But this woman lost it all. Essentially she said, “You’re
going to die for this.” And she didn’t attack the people who did this to her; she attacked the people she could get to, which is
what folks do in this kind of business.
I do not want anything bad to happen to the state of Israel. I don’t want bad things to happen to us, but I think they will. That’s
part of it. So if you look carefully at the situation, you might decide that, well, maybe we shouldn’t be doing this. But if you
don’t want to look at the issues, then you can’t even consider the question of continuing or changing a policy.
In the Middle East, they see us as hostile and they have proof of it all through the area—now in Iraq and in Palestine. That’s going
to motivate some people to
become aberrational—that’s the word we’d have to use. These people are worthy of being gotten rid of, if you can figure out who they
are beforehand. But you can’t.
Question: I’d like to compliment you on most of what you’ve said today. I think the emphasis on cultural differences is extremely
valuable. But I think it needs a couple of caveats. I’ve always held as a principle that facts never speak for themselves. There’s
always a ventriloquist. And, in part, we see, especially in an age of media-driven demagoguery, that certain aspects of culture can
be emphasized. Milosevic was one of the prime examples. You had very considerable intermarriage among Serbs, Croatians, Bosnians,
Muslims, Christians within Bosnia, et cetera. You had a society that was moving in one direction, and Milosevic playing on one part
of the culture helped to push it very hard in another direction. Let me suggest, also, that our own experience in the American
south, things that were seen as immutable in American southern culture vanished within an amazingly short time, in part thanks to
political leadership, in part thanks to media, in part thanks to education, in part thanks simply to the pressures of cold reality.
So I think one of our real tasks is to almost understand the prayer of St. Francis, to know what cannot be changed, but also to know
what can be changed, and how to do it.
Answer: I agree with you totally, sir. Yet, there are some people who are die-hards who don’t let go. That’s why this idea of let’s
find these people and take them out . . . Who are they? Some of them are just growing up. You remember what one Serb said when they
accused him of killing all these little Croatians in Bosnia. He said, “Kill them when they’re young. It’s much easier. They don’t
get a chance to grow up.” This is bloody stuff. Americans have a hard time understanding it. How can they possibly feel that way?
They do, and they’re driven by things which may not even be anything more than class hatred or ethnic hatred. We, on the other hand,
are doing physically measurable, discernible things, which I do not think are in our interests.
In closing, I do suggest that the cultural differences I started with are so vast, and so profound, and so serious that you ignore
them at your peril. Now, some of you guys in uniform are still doing what I used to do. I enjoyed that trip very much. My years in
the Army and my years in the civilian service of my country. I envy you your opportunities to go on down this path. I’ve already
completed the trip. Enjoy it. Thank you very much for your attention.

=?UTF-8?Q?=29?=
Feel free to point out mistakes, coverups, and confusion.  Help us track down anyone who did bad things on purpose.  It's even fine
to try to shame those who thought they were doing the right thing but completely failed.
But it is useless and counterproductive to think this way: "USA, you have an extremely large debt to the world."  When the US makes
blatant mistakes, or even if not a mistake but was involved in destroying part of a country, often there is a lot done to rebuild. But you can't expect that reliably or too far.
At every point, nearly everyone could make a long list of those who have "an extremely large debt to the world": Germany & Japan,
British Empire, Medieval Europe, Genghis Khan, Romans, Greeks, various Middle East hordes, etc.  Every country that has had a civil
war likely has at least two groups that hold a grudge at least a little: the US does, even long after everyone involved is long dead.
The problem is that the people you are upset with are retired, senile, dead, etc.  The current population won't take kindly to being
accused too much for the present day opinions of decisions a generation or two ago.  Or, in the US, even the last administration. You'll have to learn to be happy with positive progress or live with the consequences.  This is what the US has to do with others
all the time.  If payment for slights and costs from the US perspective were extracted at US market rates, quite a portion of the
world would be indentured in some way.
In spite of what might be seen as mistakes, ignorant meddling, etc., by most measures and by enough people, the US has been a
positive force.  So there is a perception of plenty of offset overall.  Sure you can argue that, and for some it hasn't been true. But there are some broad scale effects that are true positive factors.  Any group that has a healthy culture and engages in peaceful
commerce does really, really well: Japan, China, Europe, India, Singapore, South Korea, etc.  It is likely that you can pretty much
rank the economic and cultural success of countries by how friendly they are with the US and US allies.
Those that want to keep trying to get revenge or combat whatever modernism force they don't like generally get squashed like a bug. No amount of bug bites is going to stop the US: That's only going to make the hive madder and occasionally more reckless.  And
eventually more effective and asymmetrical at quashing.  If you truly think anything will affect US dominance, you are not very well
aware of reality.  You can argue whatever details you like, but it really boils down to this: The most effective culture wins.  The
US (and, largely, other modern Western democracies) is an engine for rapidly improving culture while preventing runaway disasters. If any culture worked better than the US (as some did in the past compared to the immature US), the US would effectively adopt their
innovations or create better innovations to equal or supersede them.
Because the US pretty much shares everything with everyone, all friendly societies win too.  Stay outside of that group because you
think you have a better approach, but you don't really, and you just fall behind.  You might point to China as a holdout which is
doing fine.  But really, they are already very well on their way to converging.  They're taking their own path, unevenly absorbing
modernism, playing at military strength etc.  But that's all show, style, and face. iPhones and Androids alone will keep everyone
friendly.  This is just my opinion from partial information: Russia is having a little bump, and may regress, but the path will be
irresistible for them too.  Their oligarchy phase (like the US robber baron and organized crime phases combined in the modern era)
shows pretty much where they were on the evolutionary track in that era.  The gap between Russia and the West is tiny compared to
the West and ISIS/ISIL.
That desire to strike back scratches an itch for a few grudge holders while making a much larger group unhappy or dead, and then
breeding more grudge holders.
Are you sure you want your life's purpose to be the propagation of that stupidity?

Cool.  On the previous question of replicated email and mailman servers, I was recently looking into ways to do that.  Since all
email messages have unique IDs already, it isn't difficult to replicate messages at any point while avoiding duplicates and loops. I was concerned with Postfix, Dovecot (in mbox mode), and Mailman.  This is a link dump on that subject.  More stars mean more
promising / less obsolete:
* * ** * If people posted to the server that they are subscribed to and if servers accept email from subscribers including fully
authenticated other mailman servers, that would seem to work.  By not sending copies of posted messages back to the sender, the
originating mailman wouldn't get a second copy.  If the From was preserved in messages rather than a sister-mailman-ID, mailman
could still be made to be sure that it came from a trusted server.  A slight tweak to Mailman (or a procmail recipe) could support
signing the message or similar to indicate that it had been blessed on the sister system.  Or a sister-mailman ID could be used for
cross-mailman forwarding, with the original email ID in headers, possibly restored by a posting step.
I'd be fine running another node whenever someone wants to mess with it.  We should set up a test list to hack on it for a while. We ought to create a Docker or similar recipe for setting up a new node with a single step.

Not sure why a sexist slur makes any difference.  Murderous?  Are all US leaders, in general, murderous because the US (and others)
feels it has to act as world policeman in generally impossible to finesse circumstances?  Are policemen "murderous" because some of
them are?  What is your measure for 'murderous' here?  At what point is self-defense not murderous?  Do you think it is unfair for
the US to have an asymmetric advantage?  What does the presence of several orders of magnitude of better technological
sophistication say about any particular pairing of cultures?
The US never wants to fight.  The goal is always to buy and sell things, share ideas, and party.  Ignorant idiots who imagine that
they will pick a fight and somehow 'win' without first building a more effective culture are sadly clueless.
Feel free to point out the propaganda.  There certainly have been untrue or weak statements made by certain politicians and
officials, and usually are followed up quickly by public dissection and correction by the US and other media and others.  Perhaps in
the very short term, this is sometimes propaganda, but usually it seems more like mistakes / wrong guesses / inferences,
self-delusion, and, once in a while, ruses.  Even secret things often eventually get out; by US law, most secret things have to be
disclosed after some period of time.
But feel free to highlight, specifically, all of the propaganda that you are assailed with.
If you say so.  Seems like a character study to me, sad all around.
Examples?  References?
Research much?
We call it 'free press' and 'investigative journalism'.  Sure, there is a little bias in what they decide to investigate.  But any
untruths would be quickly countered by another news organization somewhere in the Western world.  Or RT, which doesn't seem half bad
except for certain Russian-interest reporting.
Basic humanist principles.  If you think that allowing people to suffer and die in ignorance, from disease, starvation, and stone
age practices, is the only way to avoid fascism, then your argument is pretty weak.  What is fascist about educating people about
science, sociology, psychology, etc.?
See above.  You have to be very uninformed and impressionable to believe it was a false flag attack.
The US and the Western world have been dominating the world in the cultural / technological / defense senses for a long, long time. Usually, they studiously try to avoid direct domination now by enlightened choice. To a large extent, the US doesn't want or need to
dominate the world except for security purposes.  Everyone sane wants people everywhere to have better lives in every sense.  A few
of those people think that expanding religion is the answer; I'm completely opposed to that in all forms.  Most think that better
secular knowledge and training would produce a much better life, regardless of starting point.  Unfortunately, minimizing knowledge
is a key component is a key part of the survival meme set of many religions.  The truly educated tend to graduate from religion.
If you were to choose 1000, and maybe even only 100 competent individuals with a good range of knowledge and skill from the US or a
number of Western countries, and placed them in a village anywhere in the world, absent fundamentalist warfare, they would start a
growing evolution / revolution within a generation.  The differences between societies aren't geographic, genetic, or magic: poorly
educated people with broken culture will fail anywhere while the opposite is generally true.  Nationalist fighting as if it were
equivalent sports teams or family feud squabbles with no right or wrong just obscures the real issues.  That tends to hurt everyone
not in the US and EU; on average, it hardly affects our lives.
For me, Russia is a Western country in this sense.  Metropolitan China, Japan, and India are too.  So, First World really, but most
of those are converging on Western values where it counts.
Yes, it seems you have been wasting your time.

Perhaps you were using the UK definition of 'cunt', although that usage is, I think, often as an endearment, much like 'bastard' or
'dude' in the US.  In some locales, it's almost always used in a sexist sense.  Anyway, your stooping to ad hominem attacks means
you've already lost the argument.
I was on BBSs in 1982, Compuserve in 1984, UUCP/Usenet in 1987 (a couple hops from uvax), running a server on the Internet
continuously since 1992, setting up a couple ISPs including a satellite link in the early 90's, on AOL in 1995 (I wrote BuddyList
for AOL.), and various other things.  Calling me names on the Internet is not going to phase me.
Well, no wonder.  So, if you were President of the US, what would you do differently?  How would that work better?
Define 'anarchist' and 'crypto-anarchist', think a little, and you may find some answers.
Let's go with the Wikipedia definition:
From that, you can derive a number of reasons to support and/or be aware of and/or use the techniques from cypherpunks.  For
instance, you could look at the US as being largely based on free-speech-anarchism, as per the First Amendment.  Based on that, and
perhaps borrowing from the Second, Fourth Amendments and other sources, you could easily justify an effort like cypherpunks.  In the
90's, Cypherpunks, individually and as a whole, were super important to avoid things going the wrong way in the US.  It was
important for clear-headed arguments to be made, legal and other challenges mounted in just the right way, and education and code
spread widely and evolved quickly.  Paranoid babble would not have helped, and is still not helping.
Understanding the "establishment" doesn't mean being "their" bot.  Your lack of understanding and/or irrational distrust doesn't
make you an anarchist; it shows your ignorance.

Quite a weak and lazy response; you obviously have nothing but bluster.  If you can't back up your statements with evidence, you

And empowered by freedom and free speech invented and protected by The West, and the US in particular.  It seems likely that the
degree of free speech in other Western countries came about, was extended, and/or was protected because of the US First Amendment. There was some existing precedent, and some countries have had various restrictions, but the impenetrable First Amendment provided
the most firm model.  Every aspect of interpretation had to be fought about, especially including encryption and encryption
technology, sometimes with kind of funny results.  The fact that electronic source code was restricted while the same code printed
in a book couldn't be restricted at all kind of broke some arguments.
Everything about the Internet could have been worse, and would have been had it evolved any other way.  It's not just because it
started in the US, but because of the people involved, the peculiar restrictions of DARPA funding, think tank goals, and the
telecommunications monopoly that ATT had at the time, along with their inability to believe that packet switching had any value over
circuit switching.  We are very lucky, and we owe a lot to a small set of people who made many great choices.

The US, and much of the West, fought all this out 20 years ago.
Let's expand this idea, which I posted on the 6th:
Cypherpunks could only have survived and thrived and made a difference by being predominantly based in the US.  On the other hand,
it was helped along and strengthened by international participation, which probably tipped the balance in a number of cases.  The
balance of powers, freedom vs. Federal / police control, public vs. private, etc. all tend to come down on the side of the state and
against the individual or group if a country doesn't have airtight constitutional protections.  For instance, while France is
generally a nicely free country, it had been illegal to use encryption in a lot of cases in France until fairly recently:
Encryption and privacy is like tax law: You should understand what your rights are, where the lines are, and you're within your
rights to go right up to the line.  And, when something isn't right, you should be able to explain why precisely and work to fix
it.  We keep knocking down laws that, if they survived, would become templates for other countries.  A few things that slipped
through have proved that.
Which isn't to say that the US is perfect.  In many ways, the US is always imperfect, always in a squabble or fight about rights and
limits, land grabs or monopoly and healthy commerce; that's part of the design of the system and what enables it to generally work
and improve long term.  Things tend to go in the right direction eventually, catching up with or adopting best practices from
elsewhere.  It is a model of stable instability, noise that causes eventual escape from disoptimal minima / maxima.  A lot of other
systems are similar, but seeing some of them go bad, I wonder how many are missing the complete model of balance of powers needed
for more permanent stability and resiliency.  The quality of people involved can keep any system working somewhat for a while, or
conversely they can break a fairly good system.  The interesting measure, and the real measure of comparison, is whether a system is
elastic and resilient enough to handle extreme torque, failing in little ways gracefully while never failing overall, and still keep
One apparent exception, by many people's standards, is guns where historical decisions have a long throw.  As yet another resiliency
strategy, a kind of defense in depth at the state level, it may or may not still have some of the same effect.  We'll just have to
solve the problem of effective prevention of mental illness (and very bad meme sets) while suffering some attrition on that front. Solving those is hard, but extremely important and valuable.  Determined people don't need guns to kill other people, so I'm
skeptical that gun control helps much.  We're entering the age of building anything on demand starting only with information and/or
imagination, so the impulse of controlling the existence of things is going to rapidly become less effective.  Seems like we're
almost ready to seriously work on maintaining the quality of mental health and emotional health and culture.
This book, perused last night, seems to be on the right track, exploring that direction:
Natural Security: A Darwinian Approach to a Dangerous World

@_subject: comprehending the heart's nationalism 
Not sure why a sexist slur makes any difference.  Murderous?  Are all US leaders, in general, murderous because the US (and others)
feels it has to act as world policeman in generally impossible to finesse circumstances?  Are policemen "murderous" because some of
them are?  What is your measure for 'murderous' here?  At what point is self-defense not murderous?  Do you think it is unfair for
the US to have an asymmetric advantage?  What does the presence of several orders of magnitude of better technological
sophistication say about any particular pairing of cultures?
The US never wants to fight.  The goal is always to buy and sell things, share ideas, and party.  Ignorant idiots who imagine that
they will pick a fight and somehow 'win' without first building a more effective culture are sadly clueless.
Feel free to point out the propaganda.  There certainly have been untrue or weak statements made by certain politicians and
officials, and usually are followed up quickly by public dissection and correction by the US and other media and others.  Perhaps in
the very short term, this is sometimes propaganda, but usually it seems more like mistakes / wrong guesses / inferences,
self-delusion, and, once in a while, ruses.  Even secret things often eventually get out; by US law, most secret things have to be
disclosed after some period of time.
But feel free to highlight, specifically, all of the propaganda that you are assailed with.
If you say so.  Seems like a character study to me, sad all around.
Examples?  References?
Research much?
We call it 'free press' and 'investigative journalism'.  Sure, there is a little bias in what they decide to investigate.  But any
untruths would be quickly countered by another news organization somewhere in the Western world.  Or RT, which doesn't seem half bad
except for certain Russian-interest reporting.
Basic humanist principles.  If you think that allowing people to suffer and die in ignorance, from disease, starvation, and stone
age practices, is the only way to avoid fascism, then your argument is pretty weak.  What is fascist about educating people about
science, sociology, psychology, etc.?
See above.  You have to be very uninformed and impressionable to believe it was a false flag attack.
The US and the Western world have been dominating the world in the cultural / technological / defense senses for a long, long time. Usually, they studiously try to avoid direct domination now by enlightened choice. To a large extent, the US doesn't want or need to
dominate the world except for security purposes.  Everyone sane wants people everywhere to have better lives in every sense.  A few
of those people think that expanding religion is the answer; I'm completely opposed to that in all forms.  Most think that better
secular knowledge and training would produce a much better life, regardless of starting point.  Unfortunately, minimizing knowledge
is a key component is a key part of the survival meme set of many religions.  The truly educated tend to graduate from religion.
If you were to choose 1000, and maybe even only 100 competent individuals with a good range of knowledge and skill from the US or a
number of Western countries, and placed them in a village anywhere in the world, absent fundamentalist warfare, they would start a
growing evolution / revolution within a generation.  The differences between societies aren't geographic, genetic, or magic: poorly
educated people with broken culture will fail anywhere while the opposite is generally true.  Nationalist fighting as if it were
equivalent sports teams or family feud squabbles with no right or wrong just obscures the real issues.  That tends to hurt everyone
not in the US and EU; on average, it hardly affects our lives.
For me, Russia is a Western country in this sense.  Metropolitan China, Japan, and India are too.  So, First World really, but most
of those are converging on Western values where it counts.
Yes, it seems you have been wasting your time.

Perhaps you were using the UK definition of 'cunt', although that usage is, I think, often as an endearment, much like 'bastard' or
'dude' in the US.  In some locales, it's almost always used in a sexist sense.  Anyway, your stooping to ad hominem attacks means
you've already lost the argument.
I was on BBSs in 1982, Compuserve in 1984, UUCP/Usenet in 1987 (a couple hops from uvax), running a server on the Internet
continuously since 1992, setting up a couple ISPs including a satellite link in the early 90's, on AOL in 1995 (I wrote BuddyList
for AOL.), and various other things.  Calling me names on the Internet is not going to phase me.
Well, no wonder.  So, if you were President of the US, what would you do differently?  How would that work better?
Define 'anarchist' and 'crypto-anarchist', think a little, and you may find some answers.
Let's go with the Wikipedia definition:
From that, you can derive a number of reasons to support and/or be aware of and/or use the techniques from cypherpunks.  For
instance, you could look at the US as being largely based on free-speech-anarchism, as per the First Amendment.  Based on that, and
perhaps borrowing from the Second, Fourth Amendments and other sources, you could easily justify an effort like cypherpunks.  In the
90's, Cypherpunks, individually and as a whole, were super important to avoid things going the wrong way in the US.  It was
important for clear-headed arguments to be made, legal and other challenges mounted in just the right way, and education and code
spread widely and evolved quickly.  Paranoid babble would not have helped, and is still not helping.
Understanding the "establishment" doesn't mean being "their" bot.  Your lack of understanding and/or irrational distrust doesn't
make you an anarchist; it shows your ignorance.

Natural Security: A Darwinian Approach to a Dangerous World

@_date: 2016-06-30 12:33:22

@_subject: comprehending the heart's nationalism 
The world has a long memory; true propaganda, distorting or outright lying about the actual facts, is going to be quite apparent
later.  It's fine for Russia to be proud of themselves, but it seems like they have been embarrassing themselves frequently.  In the
unlikely event that we elect Trump, we might return the favor for a while.  But everyone would see through it and know it would stop
in 4 years, so it would likely be more humorous than anything.  The US is too open and too self-examining in public for much false
propaganda to get very far for long.
I'm not sure that American Sniper is propaganda, even unintentionally.  Seems mostly like highlighting the sad situations people
have allowed to happen.  Perhaps in the Strongest Tribe sense it has some weight, but snipers are a narrow, special breed.  I would
think that the magical hand of God like drone war would have more weight.  The effect depends on what those people are thinking: Do
they realize that they can never win in any serious sense?  Do they care or are they fine with just proving a point?
The US almost completely holds back on propaganda / education in the world, maybe for fear of or a general policy against being seen
to be promulgating propaganda.  In most cases, where media and news and the Internet flow openly, it isn't really needed.  However,
when hardly anyone in Afghanistan knows anything at all about 9/11 or similar, that is a failure of the world to provide even basic
knowledge to everyone.  Separate from that, just understanding how a modern culture works, whether the US or Europe or any other
high-functioning society, would be an important thing for some seriously problematic masses of people to know.  I don't care who
causes effective education to bring these people up to date with understanding modern cultures, but it needs to happen.  In the
absence of some other paths, it would seem like an important strategy for both US State and Defense, but I don't see it happening much.
The US has no need to try to make people like it; that should not generally be a goal.  But the world, especially including the
capable Western world, both governments and populations, has a responsibility to educate those with abject ignorance, poverty, and
knowing nothing but conflict that there are better ways of being, limitless opportunities, and that they could effectively work to
modernize and become effective societies and cultures.  We need something similar to 'genocide' to identify pathological ignorance,
recognize that it leads to the ruin of many lives, and determine how to take action to stop it.  There is no need for each culture
to be exactly like the West or a particular form of government, but they should understand the options, understand how things can
work effectively and why, and be able to incorporate elements in a local way to eventually make it work.  We need to decide how
hands off we should be in allowing large areas to fumble about without making progress and even regress.  The prime directive should
only apply to societies that are functioning to a reasonable degree.
An interesting question is whether and how poisoned thinking, i.e. bad memes, are shared, instilled, and propagated to eventually
create terrorists and criminals:  What should we do to prevent spreading poisonous ideas?  Should we be rooting out bad imams,
literature, religious leaders?  Ideally, our values and culture is an effective answer to these sources, but, just like in the
biological world, eventually a successful defense will occur.  If you've read The Selfish Gene, you know that truth, rightness, or
goodness are not the goals of particular genes or memes (ideas).  The only thing that determines success is successful competition
and replication.  Our Western ideas can successfully compete and replicate against these bad meme sets, but only if they are
present.  We seem to be in a situation where some of our allies are supporting the teaching of memes that are directly opposed to
modern knowledge, including social and political knowledge.  What should we do about that?
All of this is crosscutting to security, encryption, communication, publishing, and surveillance.  Distrust is healthy, and
sometimes prudent.  And, if we fail totally as a modern society, we may need it to maintain a modern underground in our new dark
ages.  In addition to safe commerce and social connection, and balancing government and keeping it healthy, we should even better
organize and extend the ways that we help enlighten the ignorant while combating meme cancer.
I imagine that soon we'll have universally available Internet (LEOs for instance), ultra-inexpensive devices (smart phones are down
to $50 or less now), and organized, complete, and effective educational material that is somehow available, safe, and effective for
everyone.  There should be some kind of support systems of various kinds, to the extent possible.  We are failing for not working
toward these kind of things effectively enough.

capable Western world, both governments and populations, has a responsibility to educate those with abject ignorance, poverty, and
knowing nothing but conflict that there are better ways of being, limitless opportunities, and that they could effectively work to
modernize and become effective societies and cultures.  We need something similar to 'genocide' to identify pathological ignorance,
recognize that it leads to the ruin of many lives, and determine how to take action to stop it.  There is no need for each culture
to be exactly like the West or a particular form of government, but they should understand the options, understand how things can
work effectively and why, and be able to incorporate elements in a local way to eventually make it work.  We need to decide how
hands off we should be in allowing large areas to fumble about without making progress and even regress.  The prime directive should
only apply to societies that are functioning to a reasonable degree.
An interesting question is whether and how poisoned thinking, i.e. bad memes, are shared, instilled, and propagated to eventually
create terrorists and criminals:  What should we do to prevent spreading poisonous ideas?  Should we be rooting out bad imams,
literature, religious leaders?  Ideally, our values and culture is an effective answer to these sources, but, just like in the
biological world, eventually a successful defense will occur.  If you've read The Selfish Gene, you know that truth, rightness, or
goodness are not the goals of particular genes or memes (ideas).  The only thing that determines success is successful competition
and replication.  Our Western ideas can successfully compete and replicate against these bad meme sets, but only if they are
present.  We seem to be in a situation where some of our allies are supporting the teaching of memes that are directly opposed to
modern knowledge, including social and political knowledge.  What should we do about that?
All of this is crosscutting to security, encryption, communication, publishing, and surveillance.  Distrust is healthy, and
sometimes prudent.  And, if we fail totally as a modern society, we may need it to maintain a modern underground in our new dark
ages.  In addition to safe commerce and social connection, and balancing government and keeping it healthy, we should even better
organize and extend the ways that we help enlighten the ignorant while combating meme cancer.
I imagine that soon we'll have universally available Internet (LEOs for instance), ultra-inexpensive devices (smart phones are down
to $50 or less now), and organized, complete, and effective educational material that is somehow available, safe, and effective for
everyone.  There should be some kind of support systems of various kinds, to the extent possible.  We are failing for not working
toward these kind of things effectively enough.

@_subject: comprehending the heart's nationalism 
The world has a long memory; true propaganda, distorting or outright lying about the actual facts, is going to be quite apparent
later.  It's fine for Russia to be proud of themselves, but it seems like they have been embarrassing themselves frequently.  In the
unlikely event that we elect Trump, we might return the favor for a while.  But everyone would see through it and know it would stop
in 4 years, so it would likely be more humorous than anything.  The US is too open and too self-examining in public for much false
propaganda to get very far for long.
I'm not sure that American Sniper is propaganda, even unintentionally.  Seems mostly like highlighting the sad situations people
have allowed to happen.  Perhaps in the Strongest Tribe sense it has some weight, but snipers are a narrow, special breed.  I would
think that the magical hand of God like drone war would have more weight.  The effect depends on what those people are thinking: Do
they realize that they can never win in any serious sense?  Do they care or are they fine with just proving a point?
The US almost completely holds back on propaganda / education in the world, maybe for fear of or a general policy against being seen
to be promulgating propaganda.  In most cases, where media and news and the Internet flow openly, it isn't really needed.  However,
when hardly anyone in Afghanistan knows anything at all about 9/11 or similar, that is a failure of the world to provide even basic
knowledge to everyone.  Separate from that, just understanding how a modern culture works, whether the US or Europe or any other
high-functioning society, would be an important thing for some seriously problematic masses of people to know.  I don't care who
causes effective education to bring these people up to date with understanding modern cultures, but it needs to happen.  In the
absence of some other paths, it would seem like an important strategy for both US State and Defense, but I don't see it happening much.

Nice Zenaan, good responses to much of what you were responding to.  (Which must have been a troll, no sane, educated, adult thinks
those ways in the US.)  You sometimes have knee-jerk comebacks to any statement from any American, trying hard to interpret
everything in the worst possible way.  But here, although you are sort of doing just that, your positions now agree with what I see
as a reasonable view of world dynamics.
My only high-level response to the nonsense is: There is a big, and growing difference between what the US could do and what it
would ever want to do.  Any large scale attack or invasion, by anyone anywhere really but especially from America, would be an
American failure of epic proportions, regardless of whether it could succeed in any sense.  Anyone who thinks otherwise, beyond
silly thought experiments, is ignorant.
I imagine value equations for all decisions and measurements.  There is path involving such world war-ish actions that could
possibly produce a better result than other paths.  Even if you could gin up a reason, which seems very difficult, it would never
pay off.  Our political system limits and weeds out crazy, preventing it from taking over.  Crazy is the only way to make those
kinds of decisions.  That and MAD: crazy would need a crazy answer to prevent future crazy.  See: Japan, although that decision will
never be made again.

My reality is more real, and therefore more correct, than your reality.  Prove me wrong.
So, let's go back to my statement:
"Our political system limits and weeds out crazy, preventing it from taking over."
Prove that isn't true.  Especially prove that it isn't true for Americans.  The US government kept functioning normally even through
a civil war, world wars, 3 industrial revolutions, all kinds of corruption, etc.  Here, I'm not talking about exceptionalism in
general, just the point that if crazies make it into power, they are limited and don't last.  Point out a better system.  (The
British are said to no longer be making fun of our political system as of Brexit. ;-) )
I don't have time to get into it, but I think that the exceptionalism perception, the quality of it, meaning, and use, is overblown
in some key ways.  We have evidence that certain things work and certain things don't.  There is a big interplay with culture and
back stories that affect some of that, but most of it could transfer anywhere.  Maybe we're confused sometimes, but we have open
debate to try to fix that.  We regularly fix things that aren't working with only things like rights as being inviolable.  It isn't
'we are Americans and therefore you suck'.  It is more like "we have this cool open source government project, why not fork it and
see if it works for you better than that old governmentware you're running".  We are tired of being asked to fix your old broken
down governmentputer because you insist on running VMS and Windows.  Or your cousin's obsolete system because you can't support them
well.  Or whatever.  If you can make it work, then do it.  Otherwise, upgrade.

The people who think that "anarchy" in "crypto-anarchy" means "*" aren't really thinking too hard.
[1] [2] Did you read my point about free-speech-anarchy a few weeks ago?  Did you understand it?
What about the point I just made about adapting and adopting solutions to emerging changes?
Cypherpunks has always straddled a number of areas; exploring the implications of crypto-anarchism is one of them.  Even in May's
quotes in [1], it isn't necessarily the point to have a collapse of a system as a goal, but to examine it as a possibility.  I think
the attitude is that if you come to believe that encryption and other security measures must be available, perhaps as an extension
of free speech, and those cause weak or broken systems to collapse, then so be it.  All kinds of things have been exposed recently. Do you think that makes the US any close to collapse?
Bad systems should change drastically or collapse, good systems should adapt and flourish.  Do you disagree with that?

You can't 'steal' ideas except in the narrow sense of trying to convince everyone that you invented an idea first even when you know
you took it from someone else.  Or in using ideas in a way that require a license, like patents.  Philosophy isn't patentable, so
unless she insisted that no one else had thought of a particular idea, that kind of statement seems childish.
Now, if you want to use 'steal' in the weak sense, that it would have been better if a different take would have become more
popular, that's fine.  That's 'stealing the limelight'.  That's some combination of luck and lack of skill.  She had some roughness,

threaten exposure within the rules of a self-regulating system.  That's on topic.

Some discussion of "* anarchy" isn't really anarchy, it is just maybe anarchy to someone fixated on a fixed definition of their

proof that isn't the case, then present it.

My take on the Cypherpunks charter:
Cypherpunks exists to promote free speech, establish that free speech includes the freedom to have secure private speech, and to
explore how this can be accomplished.  In support of this, to understand implications of technology-enabled free speech and the
technical, commercial, and political moves needed to protect free speech.
What this does not include is promoting or bashing particular political systems or plotting their demise or constantly going on
about insane nonsense.  We've seen that train wreck before, Lance.
Nearly all problems come from ignorance.  Celebrating ignorance is ignorant.  Not seeing that problems almost universally are the
result of ignorance and then complaining about those who work to rise above ignorance is ignorant.  Sometimes well-studied people
make mistakes or are ignorant outside of their narrow focus.  Ignorant people constantly make profound mistakes and often breed more
ignorance.  There is nothing to celebrate there.
If you are ignorant, you are being manipulated.  You are essentially helpless, a pawn in somebody's plan.  It's cute how those who
are gradually becoming aware suddenly see how they are being controled and oppressed, but usually have a gaping understanding gap. Teenagers are sure that their parents are controlling and oppressing them.  (And they often are, but often not in the way that a
teenager thinks.)  A college kid who first reads Rand is sure they completely understand how the world works in clear black and
white.  People reading conspiracy theories and bits of history think they completely understand the nefarious mechanics of the
world.  Plausible and possible become certainties, resistant to facts and first-hand knowledge and even common sense.  Tiresome
nonsense, endlessly repeated.  OFF TOPIC.
Don't be the ignorant people he was complaining about.

(Apologies for rehashing this, but it seems a good time to make another pass at consensus.)
This is how I always thought about the Cypherpunks charter:

explore how this can be accomplished.  In support of this, to understand implications of technology-enabled free speech and the
technical, commercial, and political moves needed to protect free speech.
While the Cypherpunk Manifesto focuses mainly on predicting how the then-new ideas might play out, it is very thin on clarity of
what should happen and what roles those present should play.  I think that was intentional and strategic.  It was also written at
the beginning of a period of serious conflicts about using encryption at all, public knowledge of encryption and secure methods,
export, government access and control boundary exploration, etc.
What this does not include is promoting or bashing particular political systems or plotting their demise or constantly going on
about insane nonsense.
What is your concise summary of Cypherpunks?  Can you justify it?  What does the above get wrong and why?
[1] [2] Recent commentary repeated for coherency, entertainment, and to forestall the need for certain predictable responses:
Regardless of what Tim may or may not have wanted to happen in some or all cases, it doesn't say it in his signature, or in the
Cypherpunks has always straddled a number of areas; exploring the implications of crypto-anarchism is one of them.  Even in May's
quotes in [1], it isn't necessarily the point to have a collapse of a system as a goal, but to examine it as a possibility.  I think
the attitude is that if you come to believe that encryption and other security measures must be available, perhaps as an extension
of free speech, and those cause weak or broken systems to collapse, then so be it.
Some discussion of "* anarchy" isn't really anarchy, it is just maybe anarchy to someone fixated on a fixed definition of their
favorite system.  Or a signal by someone suggesting such a departure.  Any real political anarchy has been a failure.

Yes, I should have included that link.  Let's call it [EricCM].  I just reread it a day or two ago.  My short statement is an
attempt to condense that to its essence.
That seems like a nuanced use of 'secrecy'.  This extends what is in [EricCM].  If you want your own privacy but you want to deprive
others, whether individual or organization, of theirs, I think you need to be specific about what situations you are talking about.
Where is the line between "used for efficient and safe functioning of government" and "subverted for political purposes"?  Debating
that line seems off topic.
Authority always wins because, in a healthy system, authority is us.  You have to first narrow your scope to 'abusers' or 'actually
corrupt politicians' or similar if you want to 'win' against them.  This is the same problem as treating all civilians as criminals
or thugs or whatever: If you aren't specific, you fail.

With a good critical thinking base, it is fairly easy to avoid the 'evil' of technology and technology-enabled communications while
benefiting greatly from broad knowledge, understanding, and, ideally, beneficial connections.  If you are limited to or you choose
the path of ignorance, you may fall for anything.
Good critical thinking capability, along with a good awareness of scams, cognitive bias mistake patterns, and risk analysis, is a
multi-layered defense-in-depth system, with the penultimate safety of a cognitive-enabled application level firewall.  Lesser mental
architectures try to stop everything with a port-based firewalls or anti-virus, but they're wide open to easily constructed phishing
and zero-day attack.  Openness to memetic infection is like allowing anyone to run code as root at the host level rather than in a
throwaway Docker container.  The opposite problem is being so afraid of being taken again that you won't incorporate anything new
because you don't trust that you can discriminate.  That's a lot like refusing to update your software for fear of exploit but
leaving yourself open to now-known bugs and gaps that have been fixed.  Or you simply are used to your current pattern and dislike

Good to monitor and correct but not necessarily bad overall.  Wall Street and others have always used questionable data at many
levels.  In a neighborhood that I lived in for a long time, it was very obvious that once-every-10-years census data was almost
completely controlling development.  The existing credit laws should force companies to expose what factors they used in making a
decision.  That should either expose or limit the use of new types of big data.
One thing we need more of is communities comparing themselves to others in comprehensive ways to realize that they have problems
that they should address.  The open data movement, open government data especially, is extremely helpful for this.  This is a really
good example:
One good result of open data and democratized big data processing might be that we become more efficient in good ways.  For
instance, it would be good if we could become more effective at meritocratic commerce and innovation while drastically lowering the
amounts skimmed by the Wall Street-driven finance industry.  There are too many cases where Finance absorbs much if not all of the
profit generated by some companies and industries.  I don't mind them getting paid for their value, but often they take it all and

I can understand why people would get the wrong idea from watching the news, various fights, and vitriol.  But, in most places in
the US most of the time, the number of people in gangs committing crimes or otherwise acting out is minuscule.  A few people scream

little by area, but for something like 90% of the population, there is little conflict nearby.
Outside of gangs in Chicago, Oakland, etc., and some deep South areas that want to hang on to discrimination no matter what, it is
hard to argue that there is any kind of "chaos".  Things evolve, as they have been, and some people are on the wrong side of
history.  Commercialism, political tactics, and other manipulations, including religious, have to continually evolve and work to
stay relevant.  Although sometimes it takes far too long, eventually most people see through the tactics and become resistant.  A
lot of overhead has been squeezed out of the system, benefiting consumers in most cases.  More evolution will help more than it hurts.

Although they can work to coopt and compromise in various ways, there are legal limits to control of crypto and security in the US. That's what all the fights in the 90's were about.  We've seen that ATT and Microsoft seem to easily turn over, or enable to be
turned over, access to everyone's data.  And now there are some avenues to combat this in court and public opinion.  Others aren't
so cooperative.  Individuals and new companies can only be convinced on a case by case basis.  The Internet is democratic in the
sense that new attempts at perfect security and independence can always be synthesized and tried.  Not perfect, but close enough. We did not go with the needs-approval-first paradigm which is the diametric opposite of freedom and democracy.
Various levels of illegal activity would seem to act as canaries on communications systems: If they continue unmolested, then the
venue may be secure.  On the other hand, allowing illegal but uninteresting dealings, occasionally spinning up parallel construction
when someone just can't wait, would provide cover for plausible security.  That then acts as a honeypot of sorts for target traffic.
There are some obvious ways to combat this.  I wonder if they will be outlawed successfully.  I was somewhat surprised to learn of
the widespread illegality of wearing masks in public, notwithstanding cold weather and Halloween apparently.  The legal grounding
there seems an overreach; lucky it wasn't successfully applied to online personas.
Governments are, variously imperfectly, proxies for their citizens.  What communications system would be secure, reliable, and free,
while enabling the right portion of the population to break security when appropriate?  If there are terrorists, especially after
the fact but ideally before, how could their activity be exposed reliably while also reliably preventing any other traffic from
being exposed?
One answer is to make exposure the equivalent of a noop.  In the past 10 years, we've caused this to be true in many ways. Oversharing on Facebook is no big deal.  Being silly or stupid is not rare or fatal to your long-term persona because we know that
many people do those things.
At a more serious level, we want commercial or government agents to be like doctors and priests, holding and generally forgetting
our almost completely mundane secrets when the have to run across them.  That requires both strict training and ethics, but also
management, oversight, and some outlets to sense and respond to overstep.  Failure of the government to police itself well enough or
in murky ways tends to lead to leaks eventually.
Elements of governments have previously had some terrible ideas that they pursued using both public and invasion of privacy level of
information.  Some of this still happens, although the gap between reasonable ideals and actual persecutions is continually getting
smaller, at least in the US.  There is a long way to go in certain areas on drugs, sex, violence, fraud, etc., but we've come a long
long way.  In some ways, I suspect that the need to focus on anti-terrorism has caused relaxation and some abandonment of pursuing
some gray areas.
Some people really don't trust that government will consistently converge to a reasonable ideal in these areas, although it seems to
be steadily going that way in the US.  Other countries seem generally behind on that path, or for various reasons off on some other
random and less effective path.
What do you propose as an alternative that meets many of modern societies important goals?  Anti-terrorism is a good example
problem.  Fair and lucid election campaigns are another.  Open commerce that has modern controls on the market that we know are
needed for a healthy system is another.
Another thing to consider is whether some crowd-controlled but somehow tyranny of the masses avoiding system might also be an avenue
for possibly dynamic jury nullification-like judgment.

Nevada, California, Oregon, Hawaii, and Florida.  Not long after the big protests in Baltimore last year, I talked to locals in
Baltimore, NYC, DC, Oakland, LA, etc. about local protests, police interaction, etc.  A self-professed gang member in Baltimore
wanted to take selfies with my skate group at a 7-11, specifically to inspire young kids that follow him.
Multiple times, I've taken things to court pro-se, including police and police departments.  I have appealed both civil and traffic
cases (won, lost).  I have about a 50% lifetime win rate, which isn't bad for pro-se.  I've taken pictures of many police officers,
although I've never witnessed them doing anything wrong, other than a few minor dangerous abuses on the highway here and there. Most of the problem with police comes from what they are encouraged to do, ticket quotas etc.  Although often that's minor stuff,
that's all I've seen.  The serious problems are in areas and with police I never see.
A speeding ticket in California is often a fine > $500 now.  Although I haven't had a ticket for a while, at that level of fine, my
policy is to always take everything to court.  I might as well get my money's worth and a little entertainment, plus a chance I will
prevail.  I won on the last one, with good reason.  I have a thing for police that cause dangerous conditions so that they can
garner a few tickets.  I called the highway patrol once a few years ago to ask about making a citizen's arrest after observing very
dangerous behavior by an officer while everyone was driving safely down the highway.  They told me I should have stopped behind the
officer to positively identify him!  While police stonewall those things when they can, I imagine the officer gets a talking to
anyway.  I have a traffic camera in my vehicle now.

Somewhat important, but mostly details that don't change much.
Which one?
Politicians are watched pretty thoroughly.  There's some room, but most of what they accomplish is fairly public, sooner or later. The worst abuses, in Western countries anyway, seem to be grossly misleading voters just before a vote.
One pattern seems to be: Stay vague and high level while building your team / tribe.  Then gradually pump up half truths and attacks
by spinning outrage.  Then, once your team / tribe has bought in and has a habit of repeating your talking points, graduate to full
on lies and obvious mistruths that the team/tribe will parrot even more loudly as they try to drown out the other team / tribe.  Use
confirmation bias, in-group / out-group membership, and every other trick to get others to further your attacks and cheerleading. Spin any opposition statements or attempts at clarification as blatant attacks on your team / tribe.  With an apparent ownership
interest in the results, people will ignore all facts and please for reason to win and resolve their angst.
It is a tried and true pattern, never more honed, applied, and amplified in such a contest so starkly divorced from reality, logic,
and reason.  Very instructive.
Much of what corporations do is legal, whether you like it or not.  Actual conspiracies are seldom needed and usually not worth the
risk.  Many abuses have come to light, usually with a pretty good downside for the corporation.  Harder to get away with really bad
stuff than it used to be.

I think common law could be defined more precisely.  There has always been a gap between what was considered illegal and what seemed
unfair to someone.
In this context, I took that to mean 'illegal conspiracy', which has a much more specific meaning.  Using the general meaning to
justify the statement when that statement will be taken as indicating criminal conspiracies is misleading.
And usually there is nothing wrong with that.
But not necessarily illegal conspiracy.
I can see that, although it seems weak.  And it is rebuttable by the right campaign.
I claim familiarity with certain things, and demand clarity, logic, and specifics in any argument.  I make little or no claims of
authority beyond certain first hand knowledge, experience, and conclusions after reading authoritative sources.  More solidly
grounded specifics will always have an air of authority over vague hand waving and ad hominem attacks.  I can't really help that.
I'm not all that pro-statist, but I also don't ignore what is working or blindly denigrate systems that should and could work
better.  Often things somewhat broken can be fixed rather than tearing down everything that is working out of spite and blind rage. Alternatives to everything should be considered, but alternatives aren't better simply because they are alternative; there has to be
some reasoning and proof of some kind.
Plenty of this has just been exposed in the last few years.  Some of that will no longer work.  There are some cases of this still.

@_subject: Legal vs lawful vs moral; legally sanctioned yet immoral 
This is my current favorite summary of law for a few purposes.  I was just clearing up confusion about the legal jargon "controlling
legal authorities" which consistently confuses non-legal-geeks.
Note the pedigree: Thurgood Marshall Law Library Guide to Legal Research – 2016 - 2017
So, commonly, "common law" is case law, i.e. based on explicit decisions of judges.  They may base their decisions on a more general
sense of common law, but only judges can do this with any meaning.  Non-judges may think there is some principle that amounts to a
concept in "common law", but it carries no weight unless a judge specifically agrees in a context that applies to you and trumps
other legal authorities, a "common law" "controlling legal authority" in other words.  If you read a bit more there, they clarify
primary legal authority, both mandatory and persuasive, and secondary legal authority, opinions which are less weighty persuasive
legal authority.
So, an appeal to "common law" that has any usefulness must cite some legal authority, ideally a mandatory controlling legal authority.
You may or may not have noticed, but law has been likened to engineering, and software engineering in particular.  Or, like many
things, a sort of algebra or calculus.  I think of security exactly like that, especially when designing a secure information system
and related policies and procedures.  Given the rules of the system, you have to work out a mechanism to accomplish what you want or
stop what you don't want.  Appealing to wishful thinking isn't going to make your software work, your system secure, or win your
legal case.
Calculating moral balance is tricky and perhaps usually fluid.  I don't think we've clarified specifics enough to do that here yet.
You weren't making it clearly, although I think I can see it anyway.
I think the attitude of many who are involved would be that it was already illegal in some sense, just not specifically enough to
enforce.  Copyright is an extension or interpretation of property rights.  Property rights are a basic component of a legal system. Some degree of property protections is fundamental, some degree is a legislative choice that balances rights and mechanisms and
system tuning.
A characteristic of the law is that by following principles that consistently lead to a fair, just, and functioning legal system,
sometimes the majority will want something that the principles protect.  A functioning legal system is not majority rule in a number
of key ways.  In other ways it is.  Walking that distinction properly is probably the key indicator of the health of a legal
system.  Knowing that dynamic exists sometimes, the fact that a majority may want something doesn't intrinsically make it right.
There is usually a balance of rights.  Law is often a blunt instrument for various reasons.
You haven't stated what rights you think are being trampled.  A useful statement of a right requires that you indicate how it is
grounded and supported and how it interacts with conflicting rights and some logic of why a particular boundary should be in a
certain spot.
It appears that you are primarily concerned with the rights of copyright holders and their agents (First Amendment) vs. your rights
to access to public and proprietary information (What right is that?), and your rights (Fourth and Eighth Amendments) for reasonable
consequences.  I think there are two ways to interpret the typical situation:
For someone downloading something to read / listen / watch, they might be depriving someone of a little income.  Any fine or
remuneration should be roughly proportional.
For someone who shares many things in an untrackable, possibly effectively infinite way, the owner would argue that the damages are
uncalculable and that it must be prevented.  Probably legislatures have frequently been convinced of this, leading to 'stop this or
else' sentencing guidelines.  They expect that they can just keep upping the level until it stops.  This seems something like the
treatment of crimes that are totally unacceptable.  Except that maybe half the population does think it is acceptable.  Yes, there
is a big disconnect there.  But, it is inevitable unless a way is found out of it.
The music industry seems to have given in a while ago since streaming and other forms of music are very inexpensive now.  Big
artists make most of their money on concerts and merchandise while smaller artists probably don't make much.  In effect, the
commercial and social contract has changed, relieving some of the early extreme pressure.
So far, this may be mostly off topic.  But:
One key legal path should be the First Sale Doctrine.  While this would still require that valid purchases were involved, it would
allow you to loan your copy to someone else.  To do this convincingly probably requires a distributed secure system with certain
The legal landscape keeps evolving.  There should be a way to somewhat fix the situation with regard to video, books, and software
by a technological and legal construction, but it is currently blocked in the US, while being possible for software at least in the
EU.  This seems to have significantly turned on a Library of Congress report, which could change: They review copyright situations
every year, creating updates to policy that affect what is illegal.
So, one avenue to partially solve the issue by direct legal means would be to construct rationale for why the LoC should change
their opinion, perhaps relative to some system that records and perhaps enforces one-holder status for each license.  Perhaps a
blockchain system, some creative form of DRM, etc.
There could be other paths that explore whether sales couldn't have existed, because people are too poor, eminent domain in some
cases because of importance or abuse, etc.  Commercial and social models could exist, like a club that offers to group license
content based on actual usage.
But you haven't yet established why your nebulous form of 'illegal' should be respected, so I didn't see it.
If it is the way the system operates, then it isn't illegal whether we like it or not.  If we don't like it, we should make it
illegal.  In many ways, that kind of thing is illegal in the US.  You can't expect to bribe non-politician officials.
True to some extent.  But you have to play the system to combat it, or go create your own system.  But nobody will follow you for
long for the latter.
That's a mischaracterization, Mr. Trump.
You are using a nebulous, extended form of 'illegal'.  Can't reason with that because it isn't meaningful yet.
For some, general consumers, I get to do that occasionally.  For other countries which are a mess, much more difficult.  The right
move at one level isn't the right move at another.  Not doing anything is also a bad move some of the time.
I can't generalize about foreign affairs in some blanket statement, and I'm not that studied nor do I have time to do it well
anyway, but generally it is easy to complain at the strongest, or the most active, or whatever.  It is much more difficult to guess
what better decisions would have been if you knew the same things.  Everyone is failing, and the US may be failing less than many
players.  At the base, often it is the populations of these countries that are failing the most: Believing in crazy things, not
having much modern knowledge or understanding, allowing and creating brutal social systems, etc.  Nothing anyone does will make
anything better until that is fixed.  It is an epidemic of bad and missing good memes.
See above.
I am.
First, make sure it is the USA system that you really need to fix.
I don't need to convince anyone not to "tear it down".  I'm saying that anyone saying that is wasting their time.
I'm just stating the obvious.  Let us know when you have a colony of a million people somewhere just humming along with a better system.
Once you create that, then what?
You seem to have a plan.  What is it?
You want me to design your proposed solution for you?
You are perfectly free to go buy some land somewhere and start your own system, with your own entertainment, etc.  If you want to
interact with the existing systems, at least some of the rules need to be followed.
Existing legal systems are already based on that.
I'm not protecting anything.  It doesn't need protection.  I just explained my understanding.
You want me to design a solution to the pain you feel?
I'm already designing solutions to other pain, felt deeper and wider than what you're alluding to so far.  I'm busy with that.

My reality is more real, and therefore more correct, than your reality.  Prove me wrong.
So, let's go back to my statement:
"Our political system limits and weeds out crazy, preventing it from taking over."
Prove that isn't true.  Especially prove that it isn't true for Americans.  The US government kept functioning normally even through
a civil war, world wars, 3 industrial revolutions, all kinds of corruption, etc.  Here, I'm not talking about exceptionalism in
general, just the point that if crazies make it into power, they are limited and don't last.  Point out a better system.  (The
British are said to no longer be making fun of our political system as of Brexit. ;-) )
I don't have time to get into it, but I think that the exceptionalism perception, the quality of it, meaning, and use, is overblown
in some key ways.  We have evidence that certain things work and certain things don't.  There is a big interplay with culture and
back stories that affect some of that, but most of it could transfer anywhere.  Maybe we're confused sometimes, but we have open
debate to try to fix that.  We regularly fix things that aren't working with only things like rights as being inviolable.  It isn't
'we are Americans and therefore you suck'.  It is more like "we have this cool open source government project, why not fork it and
see if it works for you better than that old governmentware you're running".  We are tired of being asked to fix your old broken
down governmentputer because you insist on running VMS and Windows.  Or your cousin's obsolete system because you can't support them

of free speech, and those cause weak or broken systems to collapse, then so be it.  All kinds of things have been exposed recently. Do you think that makes the US any close to collapse?

My take on the Cypherpunks charter:
Cypherpunks exists to promote free speech, establish that free speech includes the freedom to have secure private speech, and to
explore how this can be accomplished.  In support of this, to understand implications of technology-enabled free speech and the
technical, commercial, and political moves needed to protect free speech.
What this does not include is promoting or bashing particular political systems or plotting their demise or constantly going on
about insane nonsense.  We've seen that train wreck before, Lance.
Nearly all problems come from ignorance.  Celebrating ignorance is ignorant.  Not seeing that problems almost universally are the
result of ignorance and then complaining about those who work to rise above ignorance is ignorant.  Sometimes well-studied people
make mistakes or are ignorant outside of their narrow focus.  Ignorant people constantly make profound mistakes and often breed more
ignorance.  There is nothing to celebrate there.
If you are ignorant, you are being manipulated.  You are essentially helpless, a pawn in somebody's plan.  It's cute how those who
are gradually becoming aware suddenly see how they are being controled and oppressed, but usually have a gaping understanding gap. Teenagers are sure that their parents are controlling and oppressing them.  (And they often are, but often not in the way that a
teenager thinks.)  A college kid who first reads Rand is sure they completely understand how the world works in clear black and
white.  People reading conspiracy theories and bits of history think they completely understand the nefarious mechanics of the
world.  Plausible and possible become certainties, resistant to facts and first-hand knowledge and even common sense.  Tiresome
nonsense, endlessly repeated.  OFF TOPIC.
Don't be the ignorant people he was complaining about.

This is how I always thought about the Cypherpunks charter:

explore how this can be accomplished.  In support of this, to understand implications of technology-enabled free speech and the
technical, commercial, and political moves needed to protect free speech.
While the Cypherpunk Manifesto focuses mainly on predicting how the then-new ideas might play out, it is very thin on clarity of
what should happen and what roles those present should play.  I think that was intentional and strategic.  It was also written at
the beginning of a period of serious conflicts about using encryption at all, public knowledge of encryption and secure methods,
export, government access and control boundary exploration, etc.
What this does not include is promoting or bashing particular political systems or plotting their demise or constantly going on
about insane nonsense.
What is your concise summary of Cypherpunks?  Can you justify it?  What does the above get wrong and why?

Regardless of what Tim may or may not have wanted to happen in some or all cases, it doesn't say it in his signature, or in the
Cypherpunks has always straddled a number of areas; exploring the implications of crypto-anarchism is one of them.  Even in May's
quotes in [1], it isn't necessarily the point to have a collapse of a system as a goal, but to examine it as a possibility.  I think
the attitude is that if you come to believe that encryption and other security measures must be available, perhaps as an extension
of free speech, and those cause weak or broken systems to collapse, then so be it.
Some discussion of "* anarchy" isn't really anarchy, it is just maybe anarchy to someone fixated on a fixed definition of their
favorite system.  Or a signal by someone suggesting such a departure.  Any real political anarchy has been a failure.

Yes, I should have included that link.  Let's call it [EricCM].  I just reread it a day or two ago.  My short statement is an
attempt to condense that to its essence.
That seems like a nuanced use of 'secrecy'.  This extends what is in [EricCM].  If you want your own privacy but you want to deprive
others, whether individual or organization, of theirs, I think you need to be specific about what situations you are talking about.
Where is the line between "used for efficient and safe functioning of government" and "subverted for political purposes"?  Debating
that line seems off topic.
Authority always wins because, in a healthy system, authority is us.  You have to first narrow your scope to 'abusers' or 'actually
corrupt politicians' or similar if you want to 'win' against them.  This is the same problem as treating all civilians as criminals
or thugs or whatever: If you aren't specific, you fail.

With a good critical thinking base, it is fairly easy to avoid the 'evil' of technology and technology-enabled communications while
benefiting greatly from broad knowledge, understanding, and, ideally, beneficial connections.  If you are limited to or you choose
the path of ignorance, you may fall for anything.
Good critical thinking capability, along with a good awareness of scams, cognitive bias mistake patterns, and risk analysis, is a
multi-layered defense-in-depth system, with the penultimate safety of a cognitive-enabled application level firewall.  Lesser mental
architectures try to stop everything with a port-based firewalls or anti-virus, but they're wide open to easily constructed phishing
and zero-day attack.  Openness to memetic infection is like allowing anyone to run code as root at the host level rather than in a
throwaway Docker container.  The opposite problem is being so afraid of being taken again that you won't incorporate anything new
because you don't trust that you can discriminate.  That's a lot like refusing to update your software for fear of exploit but
leaving yourself open to now-known bugs and gaps that have been fixed.  Or you simply are used to your current pattern and dislike

Good to monitor and correct but not necessarily bad overall.  Wall Street and others have always used questionable data at many
levels.  In a neighborhood that I lived in for a long time, it was very obvious that once-every-10-years census data was almost
completely controlling development.  The existing credit laws should force companies to expose what factors they used in making a
decision.  That should either expose or limit the use of new types of big data.
One thing we need more of is communities comparing themselves to others in comprehensive ways to realize that they have problems
that they should address.  The open data movement, open government data especially, is extremely helpful for this.  This is a really
good example:
One good result of open data and democratized big data processing might be that we become more efficient in good ways.  For
instance, it would be good if we could become more effective at meritocratic commerce and innovation while drastically lowering the
amounts skimmed by the Wall Street-driven finance industry.  There are too many cases where Finance absorbs much if not all of the
profit generated by some companies and industries.  I don't mind them getting paid for their value, but often they take it all and
then some.  Leveraged buyouts and pension raiding are the prime examples of this, but there are others.

I can understand why people would get the wrong idea from watching the news, various fights, and vitriol.  But, in most places in
the US most of the time, the number of people in gangs committing crimes or otherwise acting out is minuscule.  A few people scream
and shout when something is up for discussion, then, for the most part, it's all over once a final decision has been made.  Varies a
little by area, but for something like 90% of the population, there is little conflict nearby.
Outside of gangs in Chicago, Oakland, etc., and some deep South areas that want to hang on to discrimination no matter what, it is
hard to argue that there is any kind of "chaos".  Things evolve, as they have been, and some people are on the wrong side of
history.  Commercialism, political tactics, and other manipulations, including religious, have to continually evolve and work to
stay relevant.  Although sometimes it takes far too long, eventually most people see through the tactics and become resistant.  A
lot of overhead has been squeezed out of the system, benefiting consumers in most cases.  More evolution will help more than it hurts.

Although they can work to coopt and compromise in various ways, there are legal limits to control of crypto and security in the US. That's what all the fights in the 90's were about.  We've seen that ATT and Microsoft seem to easily turn over, or enable to be
turned over, access to everyone's data.  And now there are some avenues to combat this in court and public opinion.  Others aren't
so cooperative.  Individuals and new companies can only be convinced on a case by case basis.  The Internet is democratic in the
sense that new attempts at perfect security and independence can always be synthesized and tried.  Not perfect, but close enough. We did not go with the needs-approval-first paradigm which is the diametric opposite of freedom and democracy.
Various levels of illegal activity would seem to act as canaries on communications systems: If they continue unmolested, then the
venue may be secure.  On the other hand, allowing illegal but uninteresting dealings, occasionally spinning up parallel construction
when someone just can't wait, would provide cover for plausible security.  That then acts as a honeypot of sorts for target traffic.
There are some obvious ways to combat this.  I wonder if they will be outlawed successfully.  I was somewhat surprised to learn of
the widespread illegality of wearing masks in public, notwithstanding cold weather and Halloween apparently.  The legal grounding
there seems an overreach; lucky it wasn't successfully applied to online personas.
Governments are, variously imperfectly, proxies for their citizens.  What communications system would be secure, reliable, and free,
while enabling the right portion of the population to break security when appropriate?  If there are terrorists, especially after
the fact but ideally before, how could their activity be exposed reliably while also reliably preventing any other traffic from
being exposed?
One answer is to make exposure the equivalent of a noop.  In the past 10 years, we've caused this to be true in many ways. Oversharing on Facebook is no big deal.  Being silly or stupid is not rare or fatal to your long-term persona because we know that
many people do those things.
At a more serious level, we want commercial or government agents to be like doctors and priests, holding and generally forgetting
our almost completely mundane secrets when the have to run across them.  That requires both strict training and ethics, but also
management, oversight, and some outlets to sense and respond to overstep.  Failure of the government to police itself well enough or
in murky ways tends to lead to leaks eventually.
Elements of governments have previously had some terrible ideas that they pursued using both public and invasion of privacy level of
information.  Some of this still happens, although the gap between reasonable ideals and actual persecutions is continually getting
smaller, at least in the US.  There is a long way to go in certain areas on drugs, sex, violence, fraud, etc., but we've come a long
long way.  In some ways, I suspect that the need to focus on anti-terrorism has caused relaxation and some abandonment of pursuing
some gray areas.
Some people really don't trust that government will consistently converge to a reasonable ideal in these areas, although it seems to
be steadily going that way in the US.  Other countries seem generally behind on that path, or for various reasons off on some other
random and less effective path.
What do you propose as an alternative that meets many of modern societies important goals?  Anti-terrorism is a good example
problem.  Fair and lucid election campaigns are another.  Open commerce that has modern controls on the market that we know are
needed for a healthy system is another.
Another thing to consider is whether some crowd-controlled but somehow tyranny of the masses avoiding system might also be an avenue
for possibly dynamic jury nullification-like judgment.

of law.  It's already the stuff of conspiracy theories.  Any solid proof of unchecked ongoing abuse not explained away sufficiently,
which would inevitably leak eventually for anything happening consistently, would cause gigantic backlash.  The ultra-right gun
lobby and the liberal sophisticates and others would unite and squash anyone responsible.  Now that we have instances of clear video
proof to actually get at the truth more consistently, look at the reform cycle happening with police.  Messy, slow, annoying, but
inevitably toward less abuse and more transparency.

All the time.  Do you?  What are you implying that you have observed?
I run, bike, or skate hundreds of miles on the road every year.  In high school, I ran 3000 miles a year.  I get out a lot, at least
in some sense.
In the last or two year, I've been in multiple cities in Virginia, DC, NY / NYC, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Chicago, Ohio, Indiana,
Nevada, California, Oregon, Hawaii, and Florida.  Not long after the big protests in Baltimore last year, I talked to locals in
Baltimore, NYC, DC, Oakland, LA, etc. about local protests, police interaction, etc.  A self-professed gang member in Baltimore
wanted to take selfies with my skate group at a 7-11, specifically to inspire young kids that follow him.
Multiple times, I've taken things to court pro-se, including police and police departments.  I have appealed both civil and traffic
cases (won, lost).  I have about a 50% lifetime win rate, which isn't bad for pro-se.  I've taken pictures of many police officers,
although I've never witnessed them doing anything wrong, other than a few minor dangerous abuses on the highway here and there. Most of the problem with police comes from what they are encouraged to do, ticket quotas etc.  Although often that's minor stuff,
that's all I've seen.  The serious problems are in areas and with police I never see.
A speeding ticket in California is often a fine > $500 now.  Although I haven't had a ticket for a while, at that level of fine, my
policy is to always take everything to court.  I might as well get my money's worth and a little entertainment, plus a chance I will
prevail.  I won on the last one, with good reason.  I have a thing for police that cause dangerous conditions so that they can
garner a few tickets.  I called the highway patrol once a few years ago to ask about making a citizen's arrest after observing very
dangerous behavior by an officer while everyone was driving safely down the highway.  They told me I should have stopped behind the
officer to positively identify him!  While police stonewall those things when they can, I imagine the officer gets a talking to
anyway.  I have a traffic camera in my vehicle now.

Somewhat important, but mostly details that don't change much.
Which one?
Politicians are watched pretty thoroughly.  There's some room, but most of what they accomplish is fairly public, sooner or later. The worst abuses, in Western countries anyway, seem to be grossly misleading voters just before a vote.
One pattern seems to be: Stay vague and high level while building your team / tribe.  Then gradually pump up half truths and attacks
by spinning outrage.  Then, once your team / tribe has bought in and has a habit of repeating your talking points, graduate to full
on lies and obvious mistruths that the team/tribe will parrot even more loudly as they try to drown out the other team / tribe.  Use
confirmation bias, in-group / out-group membership, and every other trick to get others to further your attacks and cheerleading. Spin any opposition statements or attempts at clarification as blatant attacks on your team / tribe.  With an apparent ownership
interest in the results, people will ignore all facts and please for reason to win and resolve their angst.
It is a tried and true pattern, never more honed, applied, and amplified in such a contest so starkly divorced from reality, logic,
and reason.  Very instructive.
Much of what corporations do is legal, whether you like it or not.  Actual conspiracies are seldom needed and usually not worth the
risk.  Many abuses have come to light, usually with a pretty good downside for the corporation.  Harder to get away with really bad
stuff than it used to be.
What are the worst things that corporate heads and politicians are getting away with?

@_subject: Legal vs lawful vs moral; legally sanctioned yet immoral 
I think common law could be defined more precisely.  There has always been a gap between what was considered illegal and what seemed
unfair to someone.
In this context, I took that to mean 'illegal conspiracy', which has a much more specific meaning.  Using the general meaning to
justify the statement when that statement will be taken as indicating criminal conspiracies is misleading.
And usually there is nothing wrong with that.
But not necessarily illegal conspiracy.
I can see that, although it seems weak.  And it is rebuttable by the right campaign.
I claim familiarity with certain things, and demand clarity, logic, and specifics in any argument.  I make little or no claims of
authority beyond certain first hand knowledge, experience, and conclusions after reading authoritative sources.  More solidly
grounded specifics will always have an air of authority over vague hand waving and ad hominem attacks.  I can't really help that.
I'm not all that pro-statist, but I also don't ignore what is working or blindly denigrate systems that should and could work
better.  Often things somewhat broken can be fixed rather than tearing down everything that is working out of spite and blind rage. Alternatives to everything should be considered, but alternatives aren't better simply because they are alternative; there has to be
some reasoning and proof of some kind.
Plenty of this has just been exposed in the last few years.  Some of that will no longer work.  There are some cases of this still.

@_subject: Legal vs lawful vs moral; legally sanctioned yet immoral 
This is my current favorite summary of law for a few purposes.  I was just clearing up confusion about the legal jargon "controlling
legal authorities" which consistently confuses non-legal-geeks.
Note the pedigree: Thurgood Marshall Law Library Guide to Legal Research – 2016 - 2017
So, commonly, "common law" is case law, i.e. based on explicit decisions of judges.  They may base their decisions on a more general
sense of common law, but only judges can do this with any meaning.  Non-judges may think there is some principle that amounts to a
concept in "common law", but it carries no weight unless a judge specifically agrees in a context that applies to you and trumps
other legal authorities, a "common law" "controlling legal authority" in other words.  If you read a bit more there, they clarify
primary legal authority, both mandatory and persuasive, and secondary legal authority, opinions which are less weighty persuasive
legal authority.
So, an appeal to "common law" that has any usefulness must cite some legal authority, ideally a mandatory controlling legal authority.
You may or may not have noticed, but law has been likened to engineering, and software engineering in particular.  Or, like many
things, a sort of algebra or calculus.  I think of security exactly like that, especially when designing a secure information system
and related policies and procedures.  Given the rules of the system, you have to work out a mechanism to accomplish what you want or
stop what you don't want.  Appealing to wishful thinking isn't going to make your software work, your system secure, or win your
legal case.
Calculating moral balance is tricky and perhaps usually fluid.  I don't think we've clarified specifics enough to do that here yet.
You weren't making it clearly, although I think I can see it anyway.
I think the attitude of many who are involved would be that it was already illegal in some sense, just not specifically enough to
enforce.  Copyright is an extension or interpretation of property rights.  Property rights are a basic component of a legal system. Some degree of property protections is fundamental, some degree is a legislative choice that balances rights and mechanisms and
system tuning.
A characteristic of the law is that by following principles that consistently lead to a fair, just, and functioning legal system,
sometimes the majority will want something that the principles protect.  A functioning legal system is not majority rule in a number
of key ways.  In other ways it is.  Walking that distinction properly is probably the key indicator of the health of a legal
system.  Knowing that dynamic exists sometimes, the fact that a majority may want something doesn't intrinsically make it right.
There is usually a balance of rights.  Law is often a blunt instrument for various reasons.
You haven't stated what rights you think are being trampled.  A useful statement of a right requires that you indicate how it is
grounded and supported and how it interacts with conflicting rights and some logic of why a particular boundary should be in a
certain spot.
It appears that you are primarily concerned with the rights of copyright holders and their agents (First Amendment) vs. your rights
to access to public and proprietary information (What right is that?), and your rights (Fourth and Eighth Amendments) for reasonable
consequences.  I think there are two ways to interpret the typical situation:
For someone downloading something to read / listen / watch, they might be depriving someone of a little income.  Any fine or
remuneration should be roughly proportional.
For someone who shares many things in an untrackable, possibly effectively infinite way, the owner would argue that the damages are
uncalculable and that it must be prevented.  Probably legislatures have frequently been convinced of this, leading to 'stop this or
else' sentencing guidelines.  They expect that they can just keep upping the level until it stops.  This seems something like the
treatment of crimes that are totally unacceptable.  Except that maybe half the population does think it is acceptable.  Yes, there
is a big disconnect there.  But, it is inevitable unless a way is found out of it.
The music industry seems to have given in a while ago since streaming and other forms of music are very inexpensive now.  Big
artists make most of their money on concerts and merchandise while smaller artists probably don't make much.  In effect, the
commercial and social contract has changed, relieving some of the early extreme pressure.
So far, this may be mostly off topic.  But:
One key legal path should be the First Sale Doctrine.  While this would still require that valid purchases were involved, it would
allow you to loan your copy to someone else.  To do this convincingly probably requires a distributed secure system with certain
The legal landscape keeps evolving.  There should be a way to somewhat fix the situation with regard to video, books, and software
by a technological and legal construction, but it is currently blocked in the US, while being possible for software at least in the
EU.  This seems to have significantly turned on a Library of Congress report, which could change: They review copyright situations
every year, creating updates to policy that affect what is illegal.
So, one avenue to partially solve the issue by direct legal means would be to construct rationale for why the LoC should change
their opinion, perhaps relative to some system that records and perhaps enforces one-holder status for each license.  Perhaps a
blockchain system, some creative form of DRM, etc.
There could be other paths that explore whether sales couldn't have existed, because people are too poor, eminent domain in some
cases because of importance or abuse, etc.  Commercial and social models could exist, like a club that offers to group license
content based on actual usage.
But you haven't yet established why your nebulous form of 'illegal' should be respected, so I didn't see it.
If it is the way the system operates, then it isn't illegal whether we like it or not.  If we don't like it, we should make it
illegal.  In many ways, that kind of thing is illegal in the US.  You can't expect to bribe non-politician officials.
True to some extent.  But you have to play the system to combat it, or go create your own system.  But nobody will follow you for
long for the latter.
That's a mischaracterization, Mr. Trump.
You are using a nebulous, extended form of 'illegal'.  Can't reason with that because it isn't meaningful yet.
For some, general consumers, I get to do that occasionally.  For other countries which are a mess, much more difficult.  The right
move at one level isn't the right move at another.  Not doing anything is also a bad move some of the time.
I can't generalize about foreign affairs in some blanket statement, and I'm not that studied nor do I have time to do it well
anyway, but generally it is easy to complain at the strongest, or the most active, or whatever.  It is much more difficult to guess
what better decisions would have been if you knew the same things.  Everyone is failing, and the US may be failing less than many
players.  At the base, often it is the populations of these countries that are failing the most: Believing in crazy things, not
having much modern knowledge or understanding, allowing and creating brutal social systems, etc.  Nothing anyone does will make
anything better until that is fixed.  It is an epidemic of bad and missing good memes.
See above.
I am.
First, make sure it is the USA system that you really need to fix.
I don't need to convince anyone not to "tear it down".  I'm saying that anyone saying that is wasting their time.
I'm just stating the obvious.  Let us know when you have a colony of a million people somewhere just humming along with a better system.
Once you create that, then what?
You seem to have a plan.  What is it?
You want me to design your proposed solution for you?
You are perfectly free to go buy some land somewhere and start your own system, with your own entertainment, etc.  If you want to
interact with the existing systems, at least some of the rules need to be followed.
Existing legal systems are already based on that.
I'm not protecting anything.  It doesn't need protection.  I just explained my understanding.
You want me to design a solution to the pain you feel?
I'm already designing solutions to other pain, felt deeper and wider than what you're alluding to so far.  I'm busy with that.

I generally don't have time to waste with you puerile idiots who imagine that they are bullying people in any meaningful way toward any useful goal at all.  But one message before you two are plonked again.
If you two didn't think so shallowly and stupidly, you would see that features like "methods to determine leakers, and similar bad actors" are useful for groups fearful of illegal or otherwise improper overstep by groups like the FBI, such as by an undercover mole or false flag agent or similar.  So, as per usual, you completely misunderstood the implications, arriving at an exactly opposite misunderstanding. Typical.
You have inspired an additional feature: Training on a corpus of your rantings to auto-filter certain people from all future systems and communication as being the chronic bad actors you are.  That would be useful here on the now long-polluted Cypherpunks.  The consistency of your insane paranoia and verbal diarrhea certainly means that you are trivial for the authorities to track through any group communication system.
The FBI had a rocky, messy genesis. And for too long they did things we now solidly think of as improper and wrong.  They still have made some bad mistakes not that long ago.  There are some misguided laws that they are in charge of prosecuting.  However, they are pretty much all good people trying to do the right thing in all circumstances.  If you actually did anything useful in life, had a real job, a real company, or a real family, or if you cared about others at all, there are plenty of circumstances where you would want the FBI around to help.  That doesn't mean that we, as citizens, shouldn't expect excellence, oversight, and strict avoidance of abuse and especially lack of accountability of abuse.  And we should protect our rights in a way that doesn't enable terrorists etc. too much.
At the same time, we should try to find solutions to problems like, as I call it, the Indian Village Whatsapp Rumor Killings - what happens when unfettered encrypted messaging meets impressionable people with not much understanding of the perils of losing provenance & verification along with the asymmetry of sensationalist information flow, and how do we fix it without allowing other We do have a solution that mostly works: Centralized unencrypted messaging hubs like Facebook, Twitter, et al that can be monitored, data mined, correlated, shared with authorities, etc.  It's a bummer if that is the only workable solution.  With enough rules, that can continue to work most of the time, but it's not optimal.  Too bad this channel is so polluted, by you, that we couldn't work on an alternate solution.  We used to solve problems here.
Solving this properly will involve some balance of crypto, technology, policy, ethics, law, sociology, psychology, and economics.  If you can't understand how things are currently working, you're probably not capable of designing a better alternative.  If you think that the FBI / Google / Amazon / Facebook / Apple are only bad, or are actively trying to spy on you for immoral & illegitimate purposes, etc., that's probably not a good sign of your capability or mental health.  There is a difference between 'this is possible' and 'this multi-billion dollar company would assume they could get away with ______ without any leaks, clearly risking those billions'.  Good to examine and battle over the gray areas, where they do sometimes go too far.  But many are illogically paranoid.  A professional level of security awareness and understanding takes all of that into account, avoiding paranoia.

Really?  How is that?  What's your proof?
What are you talking about?  Do you assume often?  If you would have read any of my last 30 years of writing on the Internet, you would know that I am diametrically opposed to the Catholic mindset, in the sense you are ascribing.  Do your research.
Pick one or more aspects of your identity, profession, family, etc. Imagine when everyone decides they hate that about you and everyone like you.  They do every single thing that centralized laws now almost completely prevent.  Without anyone to complain to, all you get to do is complain to your buddies, waiving your guns at many more people waiving their guns back at you.
You do realize that we've lived through periods like this already, right?  Do you want to be living in the Little House on the Prairie when the rustlers happen by, too far for anyone to hear your screams to get help before it is too late?  What do you think all of those Western's were about?

Each may seem limited, but in aggregate, their available bandwidth exceeds the restricted bandwidth of centralized failures.
Debugging is much easier in your scalable Docker app stack running in AWS then a million individual IoT programs running autonomously distributed and uncoordinated.

I didn't say that there is a decentralized wrong being committed by every human.  You were seemingly arguing against any centralized system, that only decentralized systems were valid and workable, or at least were far better.  I disagree, depending on what you mean by centralized / decentralized in each sense.
We need, and have, a mostly centralized system of government underpinning, agreed upon law system, economics (largely), science, knowledge, etc.  Generally, that allows us to operate very autonomously and in a decentralized way already.  I seldom see, visit, or interact with the Federal, State, or even local government.  I usually interact with regulations only as constraints on my decisions and others.  Besides paying taxes and benefiting from fixed roads, limits to hazards, etc., I feel very decentralized and self-controlled most of the time.  You're arguing that disassembling that centralized / decentralized system into something more purely decentralized would be better.  I don't see it.
Efficiency.  Trying to create, maintain, and evolve many, many decentralized systems at the pace our centralized legal / information Efficiency.  The most rapid evolution.  It is well-known that society evolves fastest in cities, i.e. centralization of the population to create more turns at all interactions which moves things along faster.
Our Internet-driven society is the most decentralized that has ever existed, because of good communication.  And we can do much better.  Some of what I've been thinking about and working on.
