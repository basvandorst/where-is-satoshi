Can we have the full source code please? And where did *you* get that?
Now that everyone knows that they are being flagged when visiting the
Tor website or using Tor - people hesitate to use it. A step backward?
All the best,

SSL is broken and the metadata is in fact a huge problem. Also, users
want the convenience of a webinterface or to keep their existing email
clients. In my opinion, that problems can only be solved by a hardware
solution. We just did that.
Here is how it works:

Understandable. Currently, we use Debian, but moving to OpenWRT, which
is in test phase at the moment. When we're done, I'll offer dd images
for flashing your own CFcard. Until then, you may build your own image
directly: Its tailored for the PC-Engines alix2d3 board. If you have such boards,
you can set up a network of Enigmaboxes at home; or join the
Projectmeshnet IRC channel and ask for a peering - or set up your own
And no, there is no "software" that you can run on your machine for
that. You *want* to run it on an embedded device, so that you can power
off your workstation and still be able to receive emails or phone calls.
Best regards,

Yes, of course. Sorry, I didn't want to overrun your freedom of
decision. And I'm curious by myself where it may take us... :)
Thank you too! Great to hear.
