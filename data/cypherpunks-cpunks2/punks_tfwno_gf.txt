We will content ourselves with making one simple observation on the subject of this new regime.
Just as the monopoly on security logically had to spawn universal monopoly, so communistic security must logically spawn universal communism.
In reality, we have a choice of two things:
Either communistic production is superior to free production, or it is not.
If it is, then it must be for all things, not just for security.
If not, progress requires that it be replaced by free production.
Complete communism or complete liberty: that is the alternative! " authorized by that law to seek his own happiness in his own way, to do what he will with himself and his property, so long as he does not trespass upon the equal liberty of others; authorized also, by that law, to defend his own rights, and redress his own wrongs; and to go to the assistance and defence of any  of his fellow men who may be suffering any kind of injustice --- how do millions of such men come to be a nation, in the first place? How is it that each of them comes to be stripped of his natural, God-given rights, and to be incorporated, compressed, compacted, and consolidated into a mass with other men, whom he never saw; with whom he has no contract; and towards many of whom he has no sentiments but fear, hatred, or contempt? How does he become subjected to the control of men like himself, who, by nature, had no authority over him; but who command him to do this, and forbid him to do that, as if they were his sovereigns, and he their subject; and as if their wills and their interests were the only standards of his duties and his rights; and who compel him to submission under peril of confiscation, imprisonment, and death?
Clearly all this is the work of force, or fraud, or both."

@_subject: Left and Right - Lesson #0 for right wingers (like james) 
Molinari wrote in 1849 : THE REGIME OF TERROR
Suppose nevertheless that the partisans of an artificial organization, either the monopolists or the communists, are right; that society is not naturally organized, and that the task of making and unmaking the laws that regulate society continuously devolves upon men, look in what a lamentable situation the world would find itself. The moral authority of governors rests, in reality, on the self-interest of the governed. The latter having a natural tendency to resist anything harmful to their self-interest, unacknowledged authority would continually require the help of physical force.
The monopolist and the communists, furthermore, completely understand this necessity.
If anyone, says M. de Maistre, attempts to detract from the authority of God’s chosen ones, let him be turned over to the secular power, let the hangman perform his office.
If anyone does not recognize the authority of those chosen by the people, say the theoreticians of the school of Rousseau, if he resists any decision whatsoever of the majority, let him be punished as an enemy of the sovereign people, let the guillotine perform justice.
These two schools, which both take artificial organization as their point of departure, necessarily lead to the same conclusion: TERROR.
In case the bottom line is not clear enough : fascists like james, who defend monopoly(monarchy) are the mirror image of the communists. Both are murderous totalitarians.
It's hilarious that james links to texts he NEVER READ and that make minced meat of his facist nonsense. Molinar has a whole book explaining the positions of socialists, conservatives AND LIBERTARIANS, including libertarian anarchy :

FRENCH QUOTE
"Mais admettez que les partisans d'une organisation factice, monopoleurs ou communistes, aient raison; que la société ne soit point naturellement organisée, et qu'aux hommes incombe incessamment la tâche de faire et de défaire les lois qui la régissent, voyez dans quelle lamentable situation se trouvera le monde. L'autorité morale des gouvernants ne s'appuyant, en réalité, que sur l'intérêt des gouvernés, et ceux-ci ayant une naturelle tendance à résister à tout ce qui blesse leur intérêt, il faudra que la force matérielle prête incessamment secours à l'autorité méconnue.
Monopoleurs et communistes ont, du reste, parfaitement compris cette nécessité.
Si quelqu'un, dit M. de Maistre, essaye de se soustraire à l'autorité des élus de Dieu, qu'il soit livré au bras séculier, que le bourreau fasse son office.
Si quelqu'un méconnaît l'autorité des élus du peuple, disent les théoriciens de l'école de Rousseau, s'il résiste à une décision quelconque de la majorité, qu'il soit puni comme criminel envers le peuple souverain, que l'échafaud en fasse justice.
Ces deux écoles, qui prennent pour point de départ l'organisation factice, aboutissent donc nécessairement au même terme, à la TERREUR."

the bad effects of high wages in raising the price, and thereby lessening
the sale of their goods, both at home and abroad. They say nothing
concerning the bad effects of high profits ; they are silent with regard to
the pernicious effects of their own gains; they complain only of those of
other people." masters and their workmen, its counsellors are always the masters. When the regulation,
therefore, is in favour of the workmen, it is always just and equitable; but it is sometimes
otherwise when in favour of the masters. Thus the law which obliges the masters in several
different trades to pay their workmen in money, and not in goods, is quite just and equitable." together, in order to reduce the wages of their workmen, they commonly enter into a private
bond or agreement, not to give more than a certain wage, under a certain penalty. Were the
workmen to enter into a contrary combination of the same kind, not to accept of a certain
wage, under a certain penalty, the law would punish them very severely; and, if it dealt
impartially, it would treat the masters in the same manner. " -- but of course it doesn't.

The laudable motive of all these regulations is to extend our own manufactures, not by their own improvement, but by the depression of those of all our neighbours, and by putting an end, as much as possible, to the troublesome competition of such odious and disagreeable rivals. Our master manufacturers think it reasonable that they themselves should have the monopoly of the ingenuity of all their countrymen. Though by restraining, in some trades, the number of apprentices which can be employed at one time, and by imposing the necessity of a long apprenticeship in all trades, they endeavour, all of them, to confine the knowledge of their respective employments to as small a number as possible; they are unwilling, however, that any part of this small number should go abroad to instruct foreigners.

@_subject: digital cash and fascist metzger - cpunks archive. 
Searching for the term "Big Business" in the original cpunks archive I found the below quoted discussion. It's pretty interesting because it deals with chaum, closed source hardware...and all the usual stuff. And notice the screeching noises that metzger makes when Hughes doesn't toe the corporatist party line. As to metzger, the guy is a typical fake libertarian and true fascist with a german sounding surname, so I'd bet a couple of cents he belongs to the jooish master race. And funnily enough, it turns out that metzger used to use this address  - yep! that's the arch jew thieves lehman brothers. So a corporate fascist at lehman brothers hates cryptocurrencies while posing as 'libertarian'? Who would have thought that...
1 ------
A lot of our discussion is influenced by the ideas of David Chaum.  He
pioneered technology which could protect individual privacy while allowing
very flexible sorts of credentials and guarantees.  He has also played
a big role in the various proposals for digital cash.
But I think that Chaum has gone off in the wrong direction in the last
few years.  More and more he is concentrating on protocols which rely
on a tamper-proof, hardware implementation of a cryptographic protocol
which he calls an "observer".  This observer chip would sit in your
computer (which could be a Newton-style PDA or a smart card) and would
play an important part in the exchanges of information, cash, or credentials
which you would make with others.  The observer basically makes sure you
are telling the truth in your transactions, that you are not double-spending
your digital cash, or not claiming a credential which you don't have.
Now, this approach has the obvious advantage that it allows solving
certain problems which can't be solved otherwise.  There appears to be
no way to provide for secure, off-line digital cash, for example, other
than with something like an observer.
But it has the equally obvious problem of relying on a tamper-proof
chip as a necessary part of the protocol.  Recently it seems that many
of the papers out of his group are designed to explore observer-based
protocols.  This means that these ideas are not useful for software-only
implementations.  One of the (relatively few) strengths that we and the
forces we represent have is that free software can be spread very far
and very fast, making it hard for those opposed to privacy to successfully
stop our efforts.  Any technology based on special chips is going to
lose these advantages.
Another problem with the observer is psychological.  Although Chaum goes
to great lengths to design his cryptographic protocols so that even a
cheating observer can learn effectively NOTHING about the computer user
that would compromise his privacy, people may still feel uncomfortable
about having a mechanical "conscience" in their pocket.  People want to
feel in control of their computers, and I think supporting this control
is a big part of the Cypherpunks philosophy.
A related point is that there have already been comparisons on sci.crypt
between Chaum's observers and the Clipper chip, in that both rely on
tamper-resistant technology to implement features which are not entirely
in their owner's best interests.  Assuming we do manage to successfully
defeat Clipper, the taint of this association may increase resistance to
I wish Chaum and his group would stop directing their efforts towards
protocols which require an observer chip to be effective.  Granted,
there are some things that don't work as nicely without observers.  But
I think that a realistic appraisal of the pros and cons suggests that
non-observer protocols are more likely to further our ultimate goal of
personal privacy.
Hal Finney
hfinney at shell.portal.com
2 ------
There is no silver bullet!
Here are some comments about why there are no easy to use "digital
coins," and why the digital money protocols are so complicated and
involve banks, tamper-resistant modules, and other things that may not
be make difficult some of our Cypherpunks goals.
I agree with Hal Finney's basic point about David Chaum's current
direction: it is not precisely the direction I'd like to see.
However, in Chaum's defense, his is only one group and can only do so
much. I don't see other groups pursuing digital cash with the same
vigor and depth, save for the occasional paper about "electronic
wallets" and so forth, and so Chaum is doing what he is doing.
It is possible that someone here in Cypherpunks will develop some form
of competing system. (Bear in mind, though, that these protocols are
notoriously complicated, and involve issues of forgery, spoofing,
denial (that a transaction occurred), tax laws, and so on.)
One of Hal's points deserves special comment:
(speaking of the observer protocol)
There are no digital coins.
A physical piece of gold, the canonical piece of money, is essentially
imposssible to counterfeit/forge, so coins can be passed from person
to person, person to shop, to banks, to tax collectors, etc. It is the
ultimate "bearer instrument." Importantly, the flow of such money is
"conservative" in that the total amount of such money is constant...no
amount of trickery or protocol complexity can increase the amount
present, and only loss of the physical coins can reduce the amount.
Paper currency is ostensibly a parallel to physical money (at least in
countries on a gold or silver standard, which the U.S. is not any
longer). Strong currencies (DM, yen, dollar, SF...though this is all
debatable) still have some of the "conservative" nature, because the
bills/notes are very difficult to counterfeit and are exchanged as
physical items or tokens.
I won't get into things like VISA transactions, promissory notes,
etc., except to say they are quite a bit less "tangible" (anyone who
has gotten unexpected VISA transactions, triggered by someone out
there, understands that the transactions are much less straightforward
and tangible). A problem with digital money has always been that there apparently is
no close equivalent to a digital coin, a token which can be passed
around freely, as a quarter or a dollar bill can be.
The reasons are obvious: a cryptographic number can be trivially
duplicated (counterfeited/forged) and presented to a second or third
person. Thus, the receiver of such a piece of digital money must
confirm that it has not already been spent, that some bank will redeem
it for "real" money, etc.
Digital coupons have this same problem. (Real coupons are made fairly
counterfeit-resistant, as are such things as lottery tickets. Lottery
tickets also use a clever scheme whereby the winning number, the thing
that gets announced, is hashed/transformed into another number with a
secret key, and this second number is also printed on the ticket, but
would-be spoofers are unable to generate the second number.)
The complicated Chaum protocols, which now are going in the direction
of the tamper-resistant "observer" chips (in smartcards, PDAs, etc.),
address these issues of spoofing, denial, counterfeiting, etc., in
various ways.
Later, Hal makes another good point:
It seems likely to me that even now a group within the bowels of the
NSA and NIST is developing a "digital money clipper" (a euphonious
pun?), that is, a standard for digital money with similar sorts of
backdoors, emergency doors, etc., that Clipper has.
NSA/NIST surely knows of the pressures for digital money, and could
plan to introduce their own standard. Instead of "LEAFs" for the FBI
and other law enforcement, this one could have "IRS observers" and
"money-laundering observers" (this is wild speculation, I'll grant
you) which tie-in to currency exchange reporting, sales tax, and
income tax law enforcement systems.
It may be that Chaum, who is eager to actually get some sales to
groups within Europe and elsewhere, is already responding to some
pressures for "accountability" (the digital money version of
"wire-tappability") by various European governments and the observer
protocols are an effort to satisfy some of these concerns.
(I am not accusing Chaum of anything, just speculating that some
groups developing digital money--and Chaum is the clear leader
here--may have market or legal constraints which are shaping their
focus away from the digital money = untraceable cash = crypto anarchy
direction many of us favor.)
A "Cypherpunks digital money" system may be more urgent than ever.

deviations from the natural order. Did this not imply that vulgarity, obscenity, profanity, drug use,
promiscuity, pornography, prostitution, homosexuality, polygamy,
pedophilia or any other conceivable perversity or abnormality, insofar
as they were victimless crimes, were no offenses at all but perfectly
normal and legitimate activities and lifestyles?
requirements for entering specific pieces of property (for example, no

Moslems, Germans, or Zulus), and those who did not meet these entrance
requirements would be kicked out as trespassers. Almost instantly,
cultural and moral normalcy would reassert itself.

"nontraditional" lifestyles (homosexuality, lesbianism, communism, and
occultism) conservatives are concerned, as they should be, about the
decay of families, divorce, illegitimacy, loss of authority,
multiculturalism, alternative lifestyles, social disintegration, sex,
and crime. All of these phenomena represent anomalies and scandalous
deviations from the natural order. Did this not imply that vulgarity, obscenity, profanity, drug use,
promiscuity, pornography, prostitution, homosexuality, polygamy,
pedophilia or any other conceivable perversity or abnormality, insofar
as they were victimless crimes, were no offenses at all but perfectly
normal and legitimate activities and lifestyles?
requirements for entering specific pieces of property (for example, no
beggars, bums, or homeless, but also no homosexuals, drug users, Jews,
Moslems, Germans, or Zulus), and those who did not meet these entrance
requirements would be kicked out as trespassers. Almost instantly,
cultural and moral normalcy would reassert itself.

But I was wrong. No one attempted to refute my arguments although they justified Einstein by repeating his thought experiment and his mistakes in different forms. I was, however, dropped some pretty broad hints that if I continued to criticise the theory my reputation and career prospects were likely to suffer." ps : notice how piece of shit western 'civilization' is built on fraud at all levels, not just in the political sphere.

It is not known for sure when the first crossbows appeared. It is speculated that the Chinese made the first crossbows before the 6th century BC and it is know for sure that they used them during the Warring States period in the 4th century BC. The earliest handheld crossbow stocks with a bronze trigger were found in Tombs 3 and 12 at Qufu, Shandong, capital of the State of Lu and date from 6th century BC. Repeating crossbows that could fire more bolts without the need to feed the crossbow by hand, were first mentioned in the Records of the Three Kingdoms, were found in 1986 in Tomb 47 at Qinjiazui, Hubei Province, and originate from the 4th century BC. Chinese also used crossbow catapults at the same time. Sun Tzu's mentioned use of crossbows in his book “The Art of War”. Chinese military manuscript “Wujing Zongyao” from 1044 says that the cross bow was the most effective weapon against northern nomadic cavalry charges.
Crossbow appeared in Europe in the shape of “gastraphetes”, an ancient Greek crossbow. It was described for the first time in the 1st century by the Greek author Heron of Alexandria in his work “Belopoeica” and it was different from the Chinese crossbow in a way they were cocked. Heron said that gastraphetes appeared for the first time in 5th century and were used in the Siege of Motya in 397 BC. Crossbow was also popular weapon in Medieval times so much that they almost replaced standard bow and arrow. Longbows could shoot as precise as crossbows and faster them but soldiers could shoot with crossbows with less training and be as proficient in less time. Later crossbows called arbalests had steel bow and could shoot further and with more penetration strength than longbows but were more expensive to make and slower to reload. In the armies of Europe crossbowmen held a central position in battle formations. They attacked the enemy before an assault of mounted knights and protect their infantry. They were held in so high esteem that they were paid higher than other foot soldiers and in some armies were granted status on par with the knightly class. New drawing mechanisms like pushlever and ratchet enabled the use of crossbows on horseback but crossbows fell out of favor in 16th century when firearms appeared on the battlefields.

If the adversary provides the top two routers by bandwidth, the expected number of compromised users increases to 9464.1 Thus, the system provides poor anonymity against a wide variety of realistic opponents, such as governments, ISPs,"

My hard disk now contains an archive of all the messages (I hope...there
are 90k of them) posted on cypherpunks, since the beginning.  It's
CD-ROM sized; I'm building a glimpse index of them right now and will put
them up on the web (tentatively somewhere on  soon.  I'll also be happy to copy them onto particular media (tape, cd, etc.) if I have access to the drive, for cost + a meager amount to make it worth the
effort.  I think getting list archives distributed to as many people as
possible would be a good thing -- hopefully a recursive auction market will
start and people will leave me alone after a while.
I'm doing this because there isn't a decent searchable index anywhere
that I've found, and it would be a nice thing to have, and I don't think
the time is too far off when people will try to eliminate the list.  I've
been using the archive of cpunks as my test data set in writing Eternity
DDS -- I thought it was vaguely poetic, in a way.
Doh -- I thought my dataset included everything, but it instead just
covers every article I can think of between:
and the present.  I'm also feeling tempted to incorporate the archives of
some of the offshoot mailing lists, like coderpunks, etc.  Does anyone know of a good source for the messages before that one?  How
many were there, approximately?  If there are a bunch of them and you can
merge them with mine, I'll be happy to send you a cd of the result.
If enough people want to buy CDs of the data, I'll set up an order page,
establish pricing, etc.  Right now, for me to make a CD requires buying
media and doing it at the media lab, unless I buy a drive, so the cost
is somewhat dependent upon how many people are interested.  If someone wants
to use corporate or government money to overpay for a cd so I can buy
a cd-r writer and make it cheaper for everyone else, I'll think fondly of
whatever organization you represent :)  Utterly ignoring the copyright issues in the interest of getting wide
dispersal, especially since it's unlikely anyone cares since no one will
get rich selling cypherpunks cd-roms,

Wish granting service, will you please make the people of the world clueful enough to replace governmental/military force with cryptography?  Or
convince one of my professors that they should sign a blank thesis?)

of normal rendezvous requests. Of course, all such requests are to the same rendezvous point, the connections may appear abnormally fast, and no data is ever carried on the circuits.  If stealthiness is a goal, the attack could be mounted from client with normal rendezvous point selection, at a slower rate, and including some typical data requests as cover. This would come
at the cost of some speed and efficiency. Note also that Øverlier and Syverson [34] describe a less-efficient method of guard identification that depends on performing traffic correlation
that is less precise but is more robust to countermeasures."

@_subject: appelbaum's CV and tor's =?ISO-8859-1?B?culzdW3p?= 
In 2012, just a few months after Radio Free Asia’s 24/7 propaganda blitz into North Korea failed to trigger regime change, RFA sent folks from the Tor Project — including core developer Jacob Appelbaum (pictured above) —  into Burma, just as the military dictatorship was finally agreeing to hand political power over to US-backed pro-democracy politicians. The stated purpose of Appelbaum’s RFA-funded expedition was to probe Burma’s Internet system from within and collect information on its telecommunications infrastructure — which was then used to compile a report for Western politicians and “international investors” interested in penetrating Burma’s recently opened markets. Here you can see Appelbaum’s visa — published in the report as evidence of what you needed to do to buy a SIM card in Burma.
Burma is a curious place for American anti-surveillance activists funded by Radio Free Asia to travel to, considering that it has long been a target of US regime-change campaigns. In fact, the guru of pro-Western “color revolutions,” Gene Sharp, wrote his famous guide to non-violent revolutions, “From Dictatorship to Democracy”, initially as a guide for Burma’s opposition movement, in order to help it overthrow the military junta in the late 1980s. Sharp had crossed into Burma illegally to train opposition activists there — all under the protection and sponsorship of the US government and one Col. Robert Helvey, a military intelligence officer.
Jacob Appelbaum’s willingness to work directly for an old CIA cutout like Radio Free Asia in a nation long targeted for regime-change is certainly odd, to say the least. Particularly since Appelbaum made a big public show recently claiming that, though it pains him that Tor takes so much money from the US military, he would never take money from something as evil as the CIA.

grarpamp wrote and better than torrent quote : "Students saw Cambridge Project, and the bigger ARPANET that plugged into it, as a weapon. A pamphlet handed out at the MIT protest explained: “The whole computer set-up and the ARPA computer network will enable the government, for the first time, to consult relevant survey data rapidly enough to be used in policy decisions. The net result of this will be to make Washington’s international policeman more effective in suppressing popular movements around the world. The so-called basic research to be supported by Project CAM will deal with questions like why do peasant movements or student groups become revolutionary. The results of this research will similarly be used to suppress progressive movements.” Another booklet featured a mock advertisement that gave a visual representation to these fears. It featured “The Octoputer,” a computer shaped like an octopus that had tentacles reaching into every sector of society. “The Octoputer’s arms are long and strong,” read the mock ad copy. “It sits in the middle of your university, country and reaches helping hands out in all directions. Suddenly your empire works harder. More of your agents use the computer—solving more problems, finding more facts.”71

link-encrypted telnet session with it, and provides you with a number of services, for example a link-encrypted talk session with another user.  You'll need to maintain the link 24 hours a day to defend against statistical analysis, and of course you can chain a number of these servers together in a way similiar to chaining remailers.
This scheme seems to provide untracibility while getting around the latency cost problem of remailers, thus allowing users to talk to each other in real time, anonymously.

@_subject: Pipe-Net 
A week ago I made a suggestion for a new protocol for untracibility, but only got one response.  I'll try again, this time more forcefully.  I'm not trying to convince anyone to implement this (though of course you're welcome to!), but just to think about it and give me feedback.
Why is another protocol needed?  Right now we have only two, each of which has its own set of tradeoffs.  To summarize:
While the DC-Net will probably never be widely used, the remailer-net has a fair chance of one day providing a way for many people to send e-mail that not even governments can trace.  However, I don't think this is enough.  Efficient social and business relationships require that people be able to converse to each other in real time.  Cryptoanarchy will not come about if people cannot do this anonymously.  How well can two pseudonymous agents negotiate a contract if each message they send must be delayed several hours?  The protocol I sugguested would have low latency, moderate bandwidth costs, and moderate complexity.  It would be well suited for people to interact anonymously in a textual environment.
Lance pointed out the chain cannot be built quickly.  This is not a problem
if servers connect to each other with relatively wide link-encrypted pipes
and multiplex your connection into these pipes.
In this system, latency would never be more than a few seconds, bandwidth
cost is N*100 cps (point to point), N being the number of links in your chain.
Implementation would probably be harder than remailers, but much easier
than DC-Nets.  The protocol would also provide both sender and receiver
untracibility without any need for broadcasting.

P.S. I never gave a name for the protocol... let's call it Pipe-net.

This attack reveals what seems to be a fallacy in theoretical definitions of security.
For example, in [28], the authors state that if links are padded or bandwidth is limited
to a constant rate, one can ignore passive eavesdroppers8. This is technically correct if
a passive eavesdropper is defined as someone who cannot access the network as a reg-
ular user and compute timings on the network (which is implied by the definition used
in most theoretical work). However this attack model is not very interesting and defi-
nitely misleading. The latency attack pointed out above and the next attack we present
demonstrate that if an attacker can simply compute timings (which is as passive as one
can expect an attacker to be in practice), or use the system, link padding or bandwidth
limiting links to a constant rate does not protect the system against easy traffic analysis

Confessions of an ex commie
By James A. Donald
jamesd at echeque.com
When I was about 13, 14, 15, I felt very oppressed, and I read a lot of stuff about participatory democracy. I became very keen on participatory democracy. I realized that there would be a problem deciding who was to participate on what, but I figured that such trivial details could be taken care of after the revolution, and I joined a radical leftist group at the age of 15. They were Spartacists. Spartacists are a kind of Trotskyite, and Trotkyites are a kind of communist and there are innumerable obscure little trot factions. The communists have a saying. “Two trots, three factions.”
This particular faction of the trots was very keen on participatory democracy at that time, as were the left, and progressive forces generally at that time.
I soon saw that the sparts' modus operandi was entryism. They would join much larger organizations, organizations whose goals, motivations, and members they despised, and then take over that organization and use its funds, assets, and membership list for their own purposes, rather than for the original purposes of the organization.
It rapidly became obvious to me that if a large organization was genuinely practicing participatory democracy it could easily be taken over by a small well organized minority, and the only participatory organizations that could resist the sparts were those that were already dominated by a small, well entrenched, minority. Usually a hostile, suspicious and somewhat paranoid minority, a minority that tended to go on witch hunts for sparts from time to time, and check under the bed for sparts before going to sleep at night.
I became disillusioned with the sparts, and disillusioned by participatory democracy – and none too keen on representative democracy either. But I still believed that it could be made to work, that one could run society and the economy and socialism in truly democratic fashion, but I realized that it might not be quite as easy, or quite as democratic, as I had hoped.
At the age of seventeen I joined both the anarcho socialists and the Maoists – mostly because these were the two groups most hated by the trots.
(Some years later I learnt that the main point of disagreement between Stalin and Trotsky was that Trotsky felt that Stalin was reluctant to murder enough people, and reluctant to stamp out freedom with the sort of savage vigor that Trotsky delighted in. This did not surprise me in the slightest.)
Mostly I was active with the Maoists. The leaders of the Maoists were full of faith, zeal, and certainty. Each one's strength was as the strength of ten, because his heart was pure.
The anarcho socialist leader suffered from uncertainty, doubt, complexity, and participatory democracy. I will tell you more of the anarcho socialists later, but first, the Maoists:
In my second year at university, the leadership group of the Maoists was taken by the Chinese government on a tour of China.
Now in those days “foreign friends” who toured China usually reported that they had a really great time and that China was full collectives full of happy, free and prosperous workers all equal, all working for pure love of the common good, and all filled with holy zeal for the glorious word of Chairman Mao.
Somehow my friends missed out on the Potemkin village tour and got the reality tour instead. Or perhaps it is merely that the foreign friends who write those glowing reports are those who are best at closing their eyes.
When they returned they were changed men. When someone asked them about their trip they would be vague and quiet, and when they finally got around to answering they would change the subject and would not look you in the eye.
They would still tell you that China was a glorious workers paradise, but they no longer appeared to be listening to their own words, as if perhaps they could not bear to hear the words that they recited.
Most of them continued to work full time for the revolution, but they were no longer strong and full of faith, but weak, guilty, furtive, and a little ashamed.
Gradually, most of the members of the Maoist group dropped out, as did I.
So now I engaged in most of my political activism with the chronically disorganized anarcho socialists. The leader of the anarcho socialists genuinely believed in participatory democracy, and as result nothing got done.
We would sometimes discuss how anarcho socialism would work, and I noticed that most of us had not the faintest idea, and those that did have an idea had ideas that sounded disturbingly like the ideas that my Maoist friends had before their trip to China.
My anarchist group had no literature on Catalonia. The leader, when discussing anarcho socialism, never mentioned Catalonia. Sometimes, when interacting with other anarcho socialist groups, I would see literature on the glorious anarcho socialist society created in Catalonia for a short time. Our leader tended to treat such literature as if was either invisible or coated with radioactive waste. Not that he ever said anything that suggested that Catalonia had ever fallen short of being the perfect anarchist utopia and simultaneously the perfect socialist utopia, but he appeared somewhat uncomfortable with the word “Catalonia”. Indeed he appeared incapable of speaking that word.
Reading the Catalonia literature, I noticed something that disturbed me a little. The consolidation into larger economic units seemed curiously uniform and swift. If it was voluntary, if people themselves decided where they would work and what work they would do, you would expect the small workshops to gradually merge one by one, each merger separately negotiated.
An even more disturbing feature was the total silence from the gloriously liberated workers of Catalonia, a silence strongly reminiscent of that which I had noticed earlier from the gloriously liberated workers of Mao's China. The glowing reports of how well the Anarchist communes worked and how free they were all came from foreigners, who had been given something that disturbingly resembled the official tours given to foreign friends in Mao's China, or they came from people who sounded suspiciously like rulers. How come an anarchist society was capable of giving people something that curiously resembles an official tour? How come free people were so utterly silent?
So I stopped reading stuff about Catalonia. In one part of my mind I believed that Catalonia showed that freedom and socialism went together like ham and eggs. In another part of my mind I suspected that if I read too much about Catalonia I would suffer the same sad transformation as my Maoist friends had suffered.
But this mental conflict disturbed me, and I started thinking about property rights.
Imagine a society where you were given everything you needed free of charge, and gold was worthless or of little use. Imagine a society where you worked for the common good without compensation for specific work.
Is this not the same thing as a society where someone else decides what you need, and someone else decides what you do?
And is such a society not the same thing as a slave state?
Obviously, freedom is the choice to do what you want to do, not doing what the group thinks is good for the group. Selfishness may not be a virtue, but if selfishness is forbidden, then you are not free. And in order be free to do what you want to do you need space to do it in, and things to do it with. Property is simply those things that one is free to use or misuse as one pleases, wisely or unwisely, without asking permission. Thus freedom and property rights are inseparable.
And not only does my property make me more free, but other people's property also makes me more free, provided it is not all owned by a single entity. Freedom of the press is merely the property right of the guy who owns the press to print what he pleases, and my property right to buy what he prints, or not, as I please.
Any system where I am free to see or read what I please, and the publisher is free to publish what he pleases, is a system where someone like Stephen Spielberg will probably make a billion dollars. If I cannot choose who I pay or not pay, then the publisher has no reason to publish what I am interested in, or he else is not free to publish what he wishes. Any system where someone like Stephen Spielberg is free to make a billion dollars will necessarily be very similar to capitalism.
Imagine a society where all the printing presses and bulletin board systems were owned by the government and run by a single bureaucracy charged with ensuring that all views were given “fair” hearing, and all news was “fair” and “properly balanced”. Clearly this would be most unfree, and it is also likely that in practice certain views would not given any hearing, and that certain true facts would be deemed to be inherently misleading and unbalanced.
And even if it was all perfectly fair and balanced, it would still deny me the opportunity to be unfair and unbalanced.
So I gradually came to realize that the failures of socialism were not accidents, but rather an inherent consequence of socialism. Without private property there is no room for any freedom whatsoever.
So I gradually dropped out from the anarcho socialists, but I continued to support the struggles of the oppressed peoples of the world against the evils of US imperialism.
It seemed to me then that there was a choice between liberty and equal economic outcomes, and that those that were poor and oppressed were right to prefer equal economic outcomes to liberty and an empty belly.
It was obvious to me that when multinational corporations sought to spread capitalism around the world, it was not because they wished the workers have more choices on how to make a living.
I had come to realize that you could not have equal economic outcomes and liberty both, but it is plain that you can have both slavery and gross inequality, and plain that in much of the world there was plenty of that.
Like all good progressive folk of that time (1976) I supported the heroic struggle of the Cambodian people under the leadership of Pol Pot against the evils of US imperialism.
But those Cambodian refugees just kept on coming, and their tales of horror continued. Eventually I woke up.
I saw the truth.
There is no conflict between liberty and equality: If you hope to obtain equality by redistribution of wealth, you will need masters to allocate the goodies, to avoid a free for all, and some will be masters, and the rest subjects. The more redistribution, the more inequality you have in favor of those managing the redistribution, and against those looked after by their betters. For example when the government intervenes to secure “Employee rights” you wind up with an empowered human resources department, not empowered employees.
Inequality cannot be remedied by concentrated and centralized power, the greater such power, the greater the injustice. And power can only be dispersed if many particular people have complete authority over many particular separate things, in other words, if everything is privately owned.
Liberty is property rights. Liberty is diminished in direct proportion as property rights are violated.

snowden vomited : "Geneva is an expensive city and unabashedly posh, but as 2008 drew to a close its elegance seemed to tip over into extravagance, with a massive influx of the superrich—most of them from the Gulf states, many of them Saudi—enjoying the profits of peak oil prices on the cusp of the global financial crisis. These royal types were booking whole floors of five-star grand hotels and buying out the entire inventories of the luxury stores just across the bridge. They were putting on lavish banquets at the Michelin-starred restaurants and speeding their chrome-plated Lamborghinis down the cobbled streets. It would be hard at any time to miss Geneva’s display of conspicuous consumption, but the profligacy now on display was particularly galling—coming as it did during the worst economic disaster, as the American media kept telling us, since the Great Depression, and as the European media kept telling us, since the interwar period and Versailles.
It wasn’t that Lindsay and I were hurting: after all, our rent was being paid by Uncle Sam. Rather, it’s that every time she or I would talk to our folks back home, the situation seemed grimmer. Both of our families knew people who’d worked their entire lives, some of them for the US government, only to have their homes taken away by banks after an unexpected illness made a few mortgage payments impossible.
To live in Geneva was to live in an alternative, even opposite, reality. As the rest of the world became more and more impoverished, Geneva flourished, and while the Swiss banks didn’t engage in many of the types of risky trades that caused the crash, they gladly hid the money of those who’d profited from the pain and were never held accountable.

"the Reformation meant not the elimination of the Church’s control over everyday life, but rather the substitution of a new form of control for the previous one. It meant the repudiation of a control which was very lax, at that time scarcely perceptible in practice, and hardly more than formal, in favor of a regulation, of the whole of conduct which, penetrating to all departments of private and public life, was infinitely burdensome and earnestly enforced. The rule of the Catholic Church, “punishing the heretic, but indulgent to the sinner,” as it was in the past even more than today, is now tolerated by peoples of thoroughly modern economic character, and was borne by the richest and economically most advanced peoples on earth at about the turn of the fifteenth century. The rule of Calvinism, on the other hand, as it was enforced in the sixteenth century in Geneva and in Scotland, at the turn of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in large parts of the Netherlands, in the seventeenth in New England, and for a time in England itself, would be for us the most absolutely unbearable form of ecclesiastical control of the individual which could possibly exist."

Influenza spreads around the world in yearly outbreaks, resulting in about three to five million cases of severe illness and about 290,000 to 650,000 deaths
Globally, it is estimated that 142,000 people died in 2013 from adverse effects of medical treatment; this is an increase from 94,000 in 1990.[1] However, a 2016 study of the number of deaths that were a result of medical error in the U.S. placed the yearly death rate in the U.S. alone at 251,454 deaths, which suggests that the 2013 global estimation may not be accurate.
