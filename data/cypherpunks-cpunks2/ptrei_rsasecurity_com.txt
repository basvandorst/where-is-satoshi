Hey, I saw one of these in Switzerland, too, so it's not an "american only"

I'm sorry, I already read this somewhere on the web; the term I should have
used was "protocol": how do they use DES to create those numbers - do they
encrypt a counter, or a time, or a shared secret - what? Does anybody know?
[I assume they encrypt something based on 1) the serial number and 2) a time
or a counter.]
Plus, there are less than 24 (7 * 3.3) bits in 7 digits; how does it get
these particular 24 out of the 64 in a block?
Thanks for any help,

Some people are trying to do this. See for example
 [I especially find the "no
foreign competition" (aka "no H1-B") disgusting. Tim May notwithstanding, we
DO compete with the americans - and a lot of us are better.]
