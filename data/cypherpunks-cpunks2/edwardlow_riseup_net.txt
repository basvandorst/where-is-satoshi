True, not really rumour but supposition
"Bitcoin COULD consume [...]"

@_subject: What is consensus? 
There is a question I would like to send to the list and get some feedback.
As far as I was told, consensus is a way to reach a decision without the
need of voting, so there is no majority nor minority, no one can impose
their ways even if they are majority so no lobby and no forcing.
Clearly, education is needed for that, so everyone understands the need
of giving up a little bit in order to make it work for the common project.
Lately I've been seeing consensus described as voting system, with
majorities and minorities. My english is short, so maybe there is a word
to describe consensus as a no-voting system to reach a common solution?

@_subject: What is consensus? 
So there is clearly a difference between what some understand as
consensus (voting) and others understand as consensus (everybody agree
with no voting).
Votation should only be the last option if everybody can not agree on
the same decission, but consensus should try to avoid votations as much
as possible, IMHO
