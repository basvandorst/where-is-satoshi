Surveillance - 2Mex
Just say the word and you will never be disturbed again, surveillance
Just say the word and you will never be disturbed again, surveillance
And uh, I don't want to work for DiddyF
And no I'm not trying to fuck you when I say that you're pretty
I just want us to get the fuck off this monitor
And take the thermometer out her mouth and just Momma her
Momma learned that the reason I was stagnant
Could be related to a love of being gadget magnets
I don't want to be controlled and die in this
I don't want to be plugged into these appliances
Show me mercy and kindness
Just say the word and you will never be disturbed again, surveillance
Just say the word and you will never be disturbed again, surveillance
And uh, let's go somewhere MapQuest can't navigate
Mechanism free, me and you, we can have a date
Sing each other songs that have never been recorded
And orbit away from the static that absorbs us
For us, it's not about all the traveling
It's all about shaking the debris and unraveling
It should be about having fun and not having things
Around your neck, metal detectors just sadden me
Because, in my heart, I know metal's is inside of me
But it never detects the meddling things outside of me
Find me walking down the streets of London
So many cameras I'm in a digital dungeon
Dum Dum, I shouldn't talk about this, I'm dumb
'Cause when I talk about this most leave with some comment
Look me in the eyes, I promise I won't run
What's done is done
Take that battery off of your body and run
Just say the word and you will never be disturbed again, surveillance
Just say the word and you will never be disturbed again, surveillance
