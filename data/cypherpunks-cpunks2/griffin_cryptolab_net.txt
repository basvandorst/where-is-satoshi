Traffic Analysis Attacks on a Continuously-Observable Steganographic
File System (Troncoso, et al 2007)
StegoTorus: A Camouflage Proxy for the Tor Anonymity System (Weinberg,

There are several that briefly talk about stego, but right now there
haven't been that many devoted to the topic.

Hello Everyone,
Just wanted to let everyone know that the server that runs the Oklahoma
anonymous remailer and the chat.cpunk.us XMPP service went down
sometimes last night. Unfortunately, because a backup didn't fire off
correctly, that also means that any accounts on chat.cpunk.us and all
anonymous email in the mailq waiting to be delivered have been lost.
I'll be working on getting a new server later tonight and we should be
back up by 22:00 EST. If you had an XMPP account on chat.cpunk.us, you
will need to recreate it after that time.

@_subject: FB's Conceal secure-storage API 
Bullshit or not?
  It has some interesting elements to it, and would be a step in the
right direction for more-secure app content storage.  Though at its
base, it has some conceptual flaws.  If you root the device, you can get
the private key.  By design, there's no way to put the key on external
media (there's only one external microSD slot, and that contains your
encrypted files).  Files could be cached once decrypted.  And of course
it doesn't prevent a Finfisher-style screenshot-taking backdoor from
just viewing what's displayed on the screen.
  That's not going into the quality of encryption (which remains to be
seen).  Conceal uses a stripped-down version of OpenSSL for its
encryption algorithms.  Still, could be fun. =)
"Caching and storage are tricky problems for mobile developers because
they directly impact performance and data usage on a mobile device.
Caching helps developers speed up their apps and reduce network costs
for the device owner by storing information directly on the phone for
later access. However, internal storage capacity on Android phones is
often limited, especially with lower to mid range phone models. A
common solution for Android is to store some data on an expandable SD
card to mitigate the storage cost. What many people don't realize is
that Android's privacy model treats the SD card storage as a publicly
accessible directory. This allows data to be read by any app (with the
right permissions). Thus, external storage is normally not a good
place to store private information.
We saw an opportunity to do things better and decided to encrypt the
private data that we stored on the SD card so that it would not be
accessible to other apps. To do this efficiently, we built Conceal, a
set of Java APIs to perform cryptography on Android and make storage
more secure and lightweight. We created Conceal to be small and faster
than existing Java crypto libraries on Android while using memory

@_subject: Whonix Anonymous Operating System Version 8 Released! 
Hash: SHA512
Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and
security. It's based on the Tor anonymity network, Debian GNU/Linux and
security by isolation. DNS leaks are impossible, and not even malware
with root privileges can find out the user's real IP.
Whonix consists of two parts: One solely runs Tor and acts as a gateway,
which we call Whonix-Gateway. The other, which we call
Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only
connections through Tor are possible.
Download Whonix for VirtualBox
Download Whonxi for KVM / Qemu
Experimental. See below.
Users of Whonix 7 and below
There is no upgrade path from Whonix 7 to Whonix 8, sorry. You
have to manually download new Whonix images.
Call for Help
- - If you know shell scripting (/bin/bash) and linux sysadmin, please
join us! There are plenty of ways to make Whonix safer.
- - We are also looking for a download mirros.
- - For  we need some help with css, html,
mediawiki, wordpress, webdesign.
Download Whonix for KVM / Qemu
Entirely untested! This is only useful if you have a developers mindset!
This is the first time .qcow2 images are available (as .tar.gz, qcow2
image must be unpacked):
We have unfinished(!) instructions for KVM:
There are still a few blockers before using Whonix with KVM can be
considered sane:
Please help out solving them. Whonix also needs a maintainer to
support using Whonix with KVM.
If you want to upgrade existing Whonix version using Whonix's APT
Sorry, upgrading from existing Whonix version (0.5.6, 7, etc.) to Whonix

See Changelog between Whonix 7 and Whonix 8
* Whonix is now based on Debian stable instead of Debian testing.
* In new installations, automatic updates of Whonix's debian packages
are disabled by default. During first start, users can decide if they
want to enable Whonix's APT repository or want to leave it disabled.
* Fixed Whonix's Tor Browser download and start script for TBB 3.5.
* Fixed physical isolation build script.
* Verifiable Builds. Whonix now has a feature which allows the community
to check that Whonix .ova releases are verifiably created from project's
own source code. Also made ade Whonix's APT repository verifiable (even
deterministic!). Please see
 for details.
* Made Whonix build script configurable (can now build terminal-only
Whonix-Gateway's and/or Whonix-Workstations; 64 bit builds and more)
* Improved Whonix News's security. All Whonix News Files are now inside
one tarball, which is signed. This stops leaking how many users are
using a particular version.
* whonixcheck's Whonix News download now checks if Whonix News are still
valid (currently up to 4 weeks) and therefore detects indefinite freeze
and replay attacks.
* whonix_repository tool now has a graphical user interface; added more
command line switches.
* Set default locale to en_US.UTF-8.
* Simplified custom user installation of TorChat, thanks to dummytor.
(Protecting from Tor over Tor.)
* Removed apper and synaptic from default installation, because they are
too confusing / have too many bugs, do not always work in all cases for
all users,  can still be manually installed if wanted, see also
* whonixcheck: more configuration options, any function can now be
disabled, this is useful for users who wish to disable control port
filter proxy, they can disable the check_tor_bootstrap function
* whonixcheck: added protection against possibly malicious strings from
check.torproject.org (in case of a bug, compromise of check.tpo server
or CA compromise), IP strings are now max 50 characters long. User will
be warned in case the limit is exceeded.
* Whonix-Workstation: no longer installing Tor Browser by default, this
simplified implementing verifiable builds ( installing iceweasel
by default, which can be used to download Tor Browser, added local
iceweasel browser homepage saying that iceweasel should not be used for
anything other than downloading Tor Browser, unless one knows what one
is doing.
* Removed galternatives from whonix-workstation-default-applications
because galternatives has been (temporarily) removed from Debian testing
* Building Whonix from frozen repository, from snapshot.debian.org to
make the build script more resistant from upstream changes and also to
make Whonix verifiable.
* The Whonix Team can now use separate keys for Whonix's APT Repository
and Whonix News.
* Added technical documentation about keys in Whonix
* new man page: man/whonix_shared/sdwdate.8.ronn
* Deactivated Maximizing Windows by dragging them to the top of the
screen to prevent users from accidentally maximizing their browser
window when they are using resolutions higher than 1024x768. See
 ;
 and
 for more
information. * added udisks to whonix-shared-packages-recommended for mounting
removable drives
* KDE settings changes, set to oxygen as suggested by scarp in
"[Whonix-devel] Plastique kwin style & Widget Style"
* whonixcheck: increased timeout for the tor bootstrap.py utility from 5
to 10 seconds to make it compatible with slow systems as per bug
* whonixcheck: Whonix News File is now deterministic
* whonixcheck: Whonix News added timeout for gpg and tar
* added secure-delete, because it contains sfill, which can be used to
zero out free space, which is required for disk shrinking
* Deactivated running update-command-not-found during build, since not
deterministic (verifiable). Manually running is of course still possible.
* whonix_shared/etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list: removed the "deb
 tor-0.2.4.x-jessie main"
repository, since that repository has been removed by The Tor Project
(Tor is now in their Debian testing repository, which is already added)
* fixed a bug reported by scarp,
whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_disable_kdm_autostart: was
not disabling other display managers other than kdm. Now using the more
generic /usr/lib/whonix/display-manager-dpkg-post-invoke.
* msgcollector: fix race condition not always closing progress bar when
it reached 100%
* Whonix-Gateway: Workaround for
Set in /etc/default/tor:
USE_AA_EXEC="no" Can be commented out when that bug gets fixed.
* optionally (opt-in) building qcow2 images, first rudimentary
implementation, build target (VirtualBox or qcow2 or both) should
probably be configurable in whonix_build script (
* Whonix News Blog Download / Whonix News: Whonix News Blogs (Whonix
Feature Blog and Whonix Important Blog) are now deployed over the same
mechanism as Whonix News.
* Whonix-Workstation: better implementation of dummytor using
config-package-dev (might break compatibility with Whonix 7)
* removed adrelanos' old key; removed
whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_legacy (breaks
compatiblity with Whonix 7)
* Re-implemented uwt and dummytor using config-package-dev instead of
custom dpkg-diversions. Breaks compatibly with Whonix 7.
* Removed rawdog and pandoc since no longer required.
* moved misc scripts (Scripts for managing Whonix's offical repository
and Whonix News; debug scripts; developer documentation and deprecated
code) to * whonixcheck: do not show output of gpg for Whonix News verification
* whonixcheck: do not start whonixcheck, if whonixsetup hasn't
finished yet
* whonixcheck: new --verbose / --debug options
* whonixcheck: Check that /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward and
shooting their own feet.
* whonixcheck: Whonix News can now optionally be signed with two keys,
as long as either one is still valid, will be accepted
* whonixcheck: whonix_shared/etc/init.d/whonixcheckd: on stop, give
whonixcheck time to gracefully shut down so it can close any still
eventually open progress bars
* whonixcheck: fix, exit cleanly (close progress bar) when killed by
other instance of whonixcheck
* whonixsetup: start whonixcheck at the end of whonixsetup on
* torbrowser: hide output of gpg import; ask "Start Tor Browser yes/no"
after upgrading"
* torbrowser: added timeout to gpg to prevent endless data attacks
* torbrowser/whonixcheck: alternative method detecting locally installed
Tor Browser version. When $tbb_folder/Docs/version does not exist, i.e.
when the user manually downloaded Tor Browser, try to detect version
number from ~/tor-browser_en-US/Docs/sources/versions.; comment
* desktop: higher resolution icons for whonix_repository, whonixcheck,
contribute and donate, whonix gateway firewall, tb recommend, important
blog and torbrowser
* ram adjusted desktop starter: fixed lightdm (/usr/sbin/...) auto
* qcow2 images: added metadata preallocation
* qcow2 images: added "-o cluster_size=2M" to "qemu-img" for better
* build script: fix "sudo: unable to resolve host debian"
* build script: added --no-options to gpg to avoid conflict with user's
gpg config files
* build script: added benchmarking
* build script: whonix_build_both: support extra parameter
* build script: got rid of grml_config by using grml-debootstrap's new
environment variables feature
* build script: skip backup-img-after-grml-debootstrap and
backup-img-after-meta-package-install build steps by default, can be
re-enabled by builder
* build script: allow running build-steps.d/2400_convert-img-to-qcow2
without root
* build script: improved error handling, when error is detected, wait
until builder presses enter before cleanup and exit to make it simpler
to read error messages when building in cli
* build script: fixed update-locale bug
build script: Avoiding "perl: warning: Setting locale failed." as
suggested on  and
 by setting
export LANG="C"
* verifiable builds: new build step build-steps.d/2350_cleanup; Get rid
of /dev folder inside the vm image. This is only required for verifiable
builds. Otherwise this could be skipped. For example, "sudo
sha512sum /dev/xconsole" or "sudo sha512sum /dev/initctl" would run
forever. The /dev folder gets recreated by the kernel upon first boot.
* Improved messages.
* Lots of smaller fixes.
* Code refactoring.

@_subject: FB's Conceal secure-storage API 
Bullshit or not?
  It has some interesting elements to it, and would be a step in the
right direction for more-secure app content storage.  Though at its
base, it has some conceptual flaws.  If you root the device, you can get
the private key.  By design, there's no way to put the key on external
media (there's only one external microSD slot, and that contains your
encrypted files).  Files could be cached once decrypted.  And of course
it doesn't prevent a Finfisher-style screenshot-taking backdoor from
just viewing what's displayed on the screen.
  That's not going into the quality of encryption (which remains to be
seen).  Conceal uses a stripped-down version of OpenSSL for its
encryption algorithms.  Still, could be fun. =)
"Caching and storage are tricky problems for mobile developers because
they directly impact performance and data usage on a mobile device.
Caching helps developers speed up their apps and reduce network costs
for the device owner by storing information directly on the phone for
later access. However, internal storage capacity on Android phones is
often limited, especially with lower to mid range phone models. A
common solution for Android is to store some data on an expandable SD
card to mitigate the storage cost. What many people don't realize is
that Android's privacy model treats the SD card storage as a publicly
accessible directory. This allows data to be read by any app (with the
right permissions). Thus, external storage is normally not a good
place to store private information.
We saw an opportunity to do things better and decided to encrypt the
private data that we stored on the SD card so that it would not be
accessible to other apps. To do this efficiently, we built Conceal, a
set of Java APIs to perform cryptography on Android and make storage
more secure and lightweight. We created Conceal to be small and faster
than existing Java crypto libraries on Android while using memory

@_subject: Whonix Anonymous Operating System Version 8 Released! 
Hash: SHA512
Whonix is an operating system focused on anonymity, privacy and
security. It's based on the Tor anonymity network, Debian GNU/Linux and
security by isolation. DNS leaks are impossible, and not even malware
with root privileges can find out the user's real IP.
Whonix consists of two parts: One solely runs Tor and acts as a gateway,
which we call Whonix-Gateway. The other, which we call
Whonix-Workstation, is on a completely isolated network. Only
connections through Tor are possible.
Download Whonix for VirtualBox
Download Whonxi for KVM / Qemu
Experimental. See below.
Users of Whonix 7 and below
There is no upgrade path from Whonix 7 to Whonix 8, sorry. You
have to manually download new Whonix images.
Call for Help
- - If you know shell scripting (/bin/bash) and linux sysadmin, please
join us! There are plenty of ways to make Whonix safer.
- - We are also looking for a download mirros.
- - For  we need some help with css, html,
mediawiki, wordpress, webdesign.
Download Whonix for KVM / Qemu
Entirely untested! This is only useful if you have a developers mindset!
This is the first time .qcow2 images are available (as .tar.gz, qcow2
image must be unpacked):
We have unfinished(!) instructions for KVM:
There are still a few blockers before using Whonix with KVM can be
considered sane:
Please help out solving them. Whonix also needs a maintainer to
support using Whonix with KVM.

zero out free space, which is required for disk shrinking
* Deactivated running update-command-not-found during build, since not
deterministic (verifiable). Manually running is of course still possible.
* whonix_shared/etc/apt/sources.list.d/torproject.list: removed the "deb
 tor-0.2.4.x-jessie main"
repository, since that repository has been removed by The Tor Project
(Tor is now in their Debian testing repository, which is already added)
* fixed a bug reported by scarp,
whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_disable_kdm_autostart: was
not disabling other display managers other than kdm. Now using the more
generic /usr/lib/whonix/display-manager-dpkg-post-invoke.
* msgcollector: fix race condition not always closing progress bar when
it reached 100%
* Whonix-Gateway: Workaround for
Set in /etc/default/tor:
USE_AA_EXEC="no" Can be commented out when that bug gets fixed.
* optionally (opt-in) building qcow2 images, first rudimentary
implementation, build target (VirtualBox or qcow2 or both) should
probably be configurable in whonix_build script (
* Whonix News Blog Download / Whonix News: Whonix News Blogs (Whonix
Feature Blog and Whonix Important Blog) are now deployed over the same
mechanism as Whonix News.
* Whonix-Workstation: better implementation of dummytor using
config-package-dev (might break compatibility with Whonix 7)
* removed adrelanos' old key; removed
whonix_shared/usr/share/whonix/postinst.d/70_legacy (breaks
compatiblity with Whonix 7)
* Re-implemented uwt and dummytor using config-package-dev instead of
custom dpkg-diversions. Breaks compatibly with Whonix 7.
* Removed rawdog and pandoc since no longer required.
* moved misc scripts (Scripts for managing Whonix's offical repository
and Whonix News; debug scripts; developer documentation and deprecated
code) to * whonixcheck: do not show output of gpg for Whonix News verification
* whonixcheck: do not start whonixcheck, if whonixsetup hasn't
finished yet
* whonixcheck: new --verbose / --debug options
* whonixcheck: Check that /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward and
shooting their own feet.
* whonixcheck: Whonix News can now optionally be signed with two keys,
as long as either one is still valid, will be accepted
* whonixcheck: whonix_shared/etc/init.d/whonixcheckd: on stop, give
whonixcheck time to gracefully shut down so it can close any still
eventually open progress bars
* whonixcheck: fix, exit cleanly (close progress bar) when killed by
other instance of whonixcheck
* whonixsetup: start whonixcheck at the end of whonixsetup on
* torbrowser: hide output of gpg import; ask "Start Tor Browser yes/no"
after upgrading"
* torbrowser: added timeout to gpg to prevent endless data attacks
* torbrowser/whonixcheck: alternative method detecting locally installed
Tor Browser version. When $tbb_folder/Docs/version does not exist, i.e.
when the user manually downloaded Tor Browser, try to detect version
number from ~/tor-browser_en-US/Docs/sources/versions.; comment
* desktop: higher resolution icons for whonix_repository, whonixcheck,
contribute and donate, whonix gateway firewall, tb recommend, important
blog and torbrowser
* ram adjusted desktop starter: fixed lightdm (/usr/sbin/...) auto
* qcow2 images: added metadata preallocation
* qcow2 images: added "-o cluster_size=2M" to "qemu-img" for better
* build script: fix "sudo: unable to resolve host debian"
* build script: added --no-options to gpg to avoid conflict with user's
gpg config files
* build script: added benchmarking
* build script: whonix_build_both: support extra parameter
* build script: got rid of grml_config by using grml-debootstrap's new
environment variables feature
* build script: skip backup-img-after-grml-debootstrap and
backup-img-after-meta-package-install build steps by default, can be
re-enabled by builder
* build script: allow running build-steps.d/2400_convert-img-to-qcow2
without root
* build script: improved error handling, when error is detected, wait
until builder presses enter before cleanup and exit to make it simpler
to read error messages when building in cli
* build script: fixed update-locale bug
build script: Avoiding "perl: warning: Setting locale failed." as
suggested on  and
 by setting
export LANG="C"
* verifiable builds: new build step build-steps.d/2350_cleanup; Get rid
of /dev folder inside the vm image. This is only required for verifiable
builds. Otherwise this could be skipped. For example, "sudo
sha512sum /dev/xconsole" or "sudo sha512sum /dev/initctl" would run
forever. The /dev folder gets recreated by the kernel upon first boot.
* Improved messages.
* Lots of smaller fixes.
* Code refactoring.
* For more details, see the git log.

   The process for signing an app is: 1) generate a private key, 2) use that to generate a Certificate Signing Request (which you send to Apple), 3) Apple sends you the approved certificate (automated process), 4) convert that file to (.pem/.cer), 5) generate p12 file using that cert and your private key (and its password) together, 6) generate the provisioning file to actually build the signed app in xcode.
   While that seems like an arduous and in-depth process, getting signed malware only requires a $99 payment to Apple and a super basic "application process" to become an Apple developer.  One could probably get more mileage by distributing malware that disables signature check.
   Probably, considering that AFAIK Lavabit's SSL cert was considered such when it was ordered turned over.

@_subject: and not a single Tor hacker was surprised... 
To be fair, literally no one who works on Tor or Tor-related projects is surprised.  This is addressed at nearly every talk, nearly every workshop, and people are pretty open about it as a feature of the landscape.  That most of these are low-speed exits is pretty telling.  Most bad exits are designed to inject/replace ads, which is pretty stupid.  If you catch someone doing this, share their ad code so they can be reported to ad networks and lose the money they were trying to make.
   However, the balance of probability has it that any given user is likely to be fine.  Enforce https and don't accept random certificate errors.  If you're getting a certificate error, click New Identity and you'll find that most magically disappear (and those that don't are typically issues with the website itself - don't patronize poorly-secured websites).
   What do I mean by "balance of probability"?  Well, if you use Tor, there's about a 90% chance you'll pass through an exit run by someone I know, and a quite good chance that you'll specifically exit through a Torservers node.
   My point being that the only real answer to this problem is network diversity.  If you're concerned about "spoiled onions," run a node!  Don't have the time/money/interest? Donate to Torservers or Nos Oignons or Noisetor so that they can run more exit nodes.

It used to be the case that people would hack PBXs and dial them in a sequence.  Feels like a lost art.  =/
   As for burner phones now, $10 in cash will get you a phone with ten minutes of talk time already on it.  Another $20 will buy you an hour's worth of time, and so on. No ID required.  The idea that people are paying $75 for a burner phone, only to totally misuse it, is annoying.  Ideally, burner phones would be both disposable and used only for talking with <4 other burner phones which *also* only communicate with that same group of phones.  But even then, it's problematic to say the    Social graphing cell phone users is extremely useful.  Think of your own phone habits.  Who do you call?  An average person might call their boyfriend, their best friend, their office, and maybe order a pizza.  So how many people call those four numbers?  How many people call *one* of those numbers?  Less than ten on a regular basis?  Also, this basic social graphing doesn't even take into account one's location.  Steve Rambam has had a lot of great things to say about this as well:  (from Last Hope)

@_subject: tools used by intelligence analysts 
This is very useful, thanks for sharing.  I'd also add MATLAB to the list of tools used -- keep in mind that "intelligence analyst" is extremely broad as a descriptor.  Some of these people are low-level ex-military 35F types, some have a classical statistics research background, some are social scientists, some are dataviz experts, some are linguists.  So try to distinguish between these and offer sources when you can.
   Oh, and Cellebrite devices for mobile data collection.

One approach is to take the existing public data, make some assumptions (educated guesses) and do additional research on top of that. It's what I'm doing right now. It's also what led to the original cointelpro revelations. Before the follow-up research, it was a meaningless acronym.

Me too ^_^ eventually I realized I'd have to do it myself if I wanted more info on Topic X. I obviously don't have access to the source, but there are some clear ways to expand on the material that's been released.
Right now, the aspect I'm researching requires lots of structured research, but fully expect to come across something unexpected (a specific sourcing pattern, perhaps).
Manual desk research is the new hotness. Well... maybe not. ;) It helps that I'm really good at it, so it doesn't take as much drudgery. Once collected, some things are trimmed and cleaned up using custom tools. But data collection is all manual.
Nice! :D I'd love to hear more about your conclusions sometime.
I started by looking at one narrow outcome of the NSA's work that I find horribly disruptive to the ecosystem around my work. Now my task is to find further proof of this activity using unclassified source material and possibly patterns within their work in this area.
Indeed. Lots of excellent reasons to be light on detail in these types of public forums.  ~ Griffin

Also keep in mind that it's possible to spy on who downloads these
just by seeding the torrent and monitoring connections to your box.  So
it's certainly not anonymous.  I'd say hidden service first, a website

Hey all,
   There's been a lot of discussion around warrant canaries lately, and I just want to pipe in with my experience.
   Back in 2012, I talked to my attorney about setting up a warrant canary or a dead man's switch -- which he pointed out would have the same legal repercussions as just releasing the gagged warrant/NSL.  Why?   Because they are frequently phrased in such a way that if you do or fail to do a thing to somehow make it known, then you've violated the order.  You're in just as much trouble if you take out a billboard or tweet a scan of the order or use pantomime or comment out a warrant    The only difference is that there *might* be plausible deniability if you tell your partner "something happened at work today and I can't tell you what it is" [1], whereas you have *no* ability to deny anything if you remove a publicized warrant canary from a website.  I'm not saying don't do it, but maybe talk to a lawyer first.

   It's fairly straightforward to uncover someone's financial and public ties to various organizations by looking through public records.  But mentioning this possibility among peers is a bit of a conversation killer.  No one wants to risk invading the privacy of someone who doesn't deserve it (which is virtually everyone with NIST or IETF).
   Incidentally, when I mentioned this to a researcher who grew up in a horribly oppressive society, his response was "Why would you not do this kind of research?"  So then I was in the awkward position of explaining that A) most people care about their careers, B) people don't want to invade others' privacy, C) the risk of false-positives is non-zero.

   Want to fix games journalism?  Why not start with the large corporations that bribe their way into getting good reviews at large publications that lead to millions of dollars in sales.  Target EA, who just this week went to court to defend against a class-action lawsuit filed by gamers.  While the court found in their favor, they *also* determined that the statements put out by EA were "puffery" and did not reflect reality.  How will this impact the industry going forward?

   Targeting female indie developers is complete weaksauce.  And the fact that this comprises the vast majority of  "activism" proves the allegation that it's filled with whiny man-babies.
   You know what I *don't* care about?  People I don't know who supposedly shagged other people I don't know.  No one whose opinion matters cares about this hypothetical scandal.  It's all a pseudo-intellectual circlejerk.

First of all, it is never *ever* someone's fault when random internet creeps stalk and harass them.  If continuing to have an opinion and be in an industry is "feeding the trolls" then you should seriously consider changing your views on the subject.
As for the rest, I'd like to quote Meredith Patterson:
"A person was cruelly emotionally abused. That person called out their abuser, and in overwhelming majority, a community which claims as one of its defining characteristics an opposition to gaslighting, siloing and all other forms of abuse rallied around the *perpetrator*.  Why did that    By Newsweek's count, Brianna Wu and Anita Sarkeesian got nearly 80'000 twitter comments in response to their views on GamerGate itself.  Eighty thousand -- that's more than all journalists and news outlets combined (including Kotaku).  Tell me this isn't about the ongoing harassment of women who have an opinion.  I don't watch AS's videos and find her conclusions to be quite thin at times.  Doesn't matter -- she has the fundamental right to voice an opinion.
   My favorite part of this whole gamergate shitstorm was when Marcia Hofmann pointed out inconsistencies and someone immediately said that it was the game devs' faults for having opinions.  They said it non-jokingly and completely without irony.  The underlying message is: "Censor yourself or be prepared to go into hiding."  That's no way to live and I won't support it.
   If you're serious about journalistic ethics, then you should be prepared to send letters and form protest around large companies.  If 0.5% of EA's customers sent emails asking them to change policies or correct errors in their sales materials, their policies would change very quickly.
   Well I mentioned EA's case, and that doesn't seem particularly thrilling to you.  There was the huge fiasco a few years ago around Kane and Lynch, and I would hazard a guess that GameSpot's editorial practices haven't changed.
   And if you don't want to be associated with abject harassment, then don't hitch your wagon to a cause that harasses people.  Form a group of sane people and pick a different hashtag.  I have literally *no* sympathy for sane people who aren't willing to use a different hashtag.  They're sacrificing integrity in order to ride a wave of abjectly shitty [1] [2] [3]

@_subject: Legality of warrant canaries 
Hey all,
   There's been a lot of discussion around warrant canaries lately, and I just want to pipe in with my experience.
   Back in 2012, I talked to my attorney about setting up a warrant canary or a dead man's switch -- which he pointed out would have the same legal repercussions as just releasing the gagged warrant/NSL.  Why?   Because they are frequently phrased in such a way that if you do or fail to do a thing to somehow make it known, then you've violated the order.  You're in just as much trouble if you take out a billboard or tweet a scan of the order or use pantomime or comment out a warrant    The only difference is that there *might* be plausible deniability if you tell your partner "something happened at work today and I can't tell you what it is" [1], whereas you have *no* ability to deny anything if you remove a publicized warrant canary from a website.  I'm not saying don't do it, but maybe talk to a lawyer first.

   It's fairly straightforward to uncover someone's financial and public ties to various organizations by looking through public records.  But mentioning this possibility among peers is a bit of a conversation killer.  No one wants to risk invading the privacy of someone who doesn't deserve it (which is virtually everyone with NIST or IETF).
   Incidentally, when I mentioned this to a researcher who grew up in a horribly oppressive society, his response was "Why would you not do this kind of research?"  So then I was in the awkward position of explaining that A) most people care about their careers, B) people don't want to invade others' privacy, C) the risk of false-positives is non-zero.
   Do I think that people with suspicious financial ties should be outed?   Sure.  But no one wants to do that.  No one wants to be the messenger.
TL;DR: people love handrwringing, hate even mild risk.
ps: nah, I don't think that the legitimacy of the WebCrypto API is in

@_subject: GamerGate 
If gamergaters spent half as much time trying to fix systemic problems that they claim to care about as they do correcting "misconceptions" about gamergate, I *might* start to take them seriously.
   Want to fix games journalism?  Why not start with the large corporations that bribe their way into getting good reviews at large publications that lead to millions of dollars in sales.  Target EA, who just this week went to court to defend against a class-action lawsuit filed by gamers.  While the court found in their favor, they *also* determined that the statements put out by EA were "puffery" and did not reflect reality.  How will this impact the industry going forward?  Does  bother having an opinion on this?
   Targeting female indie developers is complete weaksauce.  And the fact that this comprises the vast majority of  "activism" proves the allegation that it's filled with whiny man-babies.
   You know what I *don't* care about?  People I don't know who supposedly shagged other people I don't know.  No one whose opinion matters cares about this hypothetical scandal.  It's all a pseudo-intellectual circlejerk.
   You either care about journalistic ethics enough to target large corporations and key players, or you're just fucking around.  Seriously.   This is as true for you (yes, you personally) as it is for the   crowd.

@_subject: GamerGate (because censorship is dumb) 
First of all, it is never *ever* someone's fault when random internet creeps stalk and harass them.  If continuing to have an opinion and be in an industry is "feeding the trolls" then you should seriously consider changing your views on the subject.
As for the rest, I'd like to quote Meredith Patterson:
"A person was cruelly emotionally abused. That person called out their abuser, and in overwhelming majority, a community which claims as one of its defining characteristics an opposition to gaslighting, siloing and all other forms of abuse rallied around the *perpetrator*.  Why did that    By Newsweek's count, Brianna Wu and Anita Sarkeesian got nearly 80'000 twitter comments in response to their views on GamerGate itself.  Eighty thousand -- that's more than all journalists and news outlets combined (including Kotaku).  Tell me this isn't about the ongoing harassment of women who have an opinion.  I don't watch AS's videos and find her conclusions to be quite thin at times.  Doesn't matter -- she has the fundamental right to voice an opinion.

@_subject: killing RC4 in Chrome [now with certificate data!] 
So, I ran a couple of quick tests, and checked for RC4... and got 1903 results for the Alexa Top 500.  Your theory about websites not switching back seems to hold water.
   It's a github repo, since apparently Github doesn't want me to create a 17000-line gist. (Fascists!)  Included are the list of supported cipher suites for 494/500 websites along with instructions on verifying/recreating the results:    The nmap command I used was: sudo nmap -sT -PN -p 443 -iL=alexa.csv --script=ssl-enum-ciphers.nse -oN=alexa_ciphers.txt
   Which only checks port 443. So if there's some magic port number you want to check (say, 9050 or 5222), be sure to swap that out first. If you want XML output, use -oX instead of -oN (and it's easy to convert xml to json if you're interested in data visualization).  The nmap script used was created by Bojan Zdrnja, praised be his name.

Aloha from Baltimore,
   The protests have been peaceful of late, and actually fairly peaceful overall.  The police, however, have not been.  Despite claiming to be basically terrified of black people congregating in large groups, Baltimore cops killed another unarmed man two days ago.  Earlier this week, I got trapped in DC overnight due to the curfew, and last night my boyfriend got trapped at my place despite living a block away.  I've got video of a hundred or so soldiers marching through the streets near the train station as the curfew takes effect (out of hundreds that did so).
   Last night, my kid sister had to come home at 10:10 and it was the first time that I've been worried about her safety since she's lived with me.  Because she's a minor, the curfew means that she's not even legally allowed outside for any reason without me present [0].  Not to go to a friend's house, or to grab a cup of coffee, or to volunteer.  Because I'm her guardian, I of course have given her permission to do all of those things because Fuck That Noise [1].  But we're also about to make our exit because living under helicopter noise with cops driving around in vehicles that have gun turrets on them is not great for the psyche, and no kid should have to live in that environment.

You'd be surprised how many of these people are open about having a TS/SCI +poly clearance.  While the people who wrote the backend for Pinwale might not be open about it on LinkedIn, people who use Pinwale in their jobs might be.  A good (unanswered) question might be just how many people who've worked for Booz Allen Hamilton (as listed on LI) *don't* use classified keywords compared to the number that do.
   People tend to think that LinkedIn is a safe environment to be open about their past work.  Which is obviously bullshit, and I'd posit that it's actually worse than Facebook because your information is shared with the general public.  Even with higher privacy settings enabled, anyone with a paid Recruiter account can see everything.

That already exists (clearancejobs.com and others). There are actually tons of ads all over DC for these services, most notably the "Life of a Secret Squirrel" series.  Really:    DC is a weird place sometimes.

One should also be aware of the implications of giving a child a very common name.  I've known several "Chris Brown"s and an unreasonable number of "John Smith"s.  Though one should be aware also of what German sociologists call 'Kevinismus' [1] -- the recognition that all names come with cultural attachments, and not all of them positive.  I get asked fairly regularly if I'm Welsh (nope) since that's the association people make between heraldry and anglicized last names.
   Being anonymous or easily confused with another person is not all positive.  In fact, I would say that it's mostly a negative.  My name is uncommon, but I went by a nickname for years because it was more interesting.  It also offered some amount of protection in the days before anyone could just buy my LexisNexis profile and know my weird middle name and past lovers' names and how many freckles I have.  Now?  Not so much.  Any name plus one or two additional data points is enough to clearly identify someone in a dataset.
   In my case, the benefits of having a relatively uncommon name outweigh the downsides.  I still have the freedom to do things anonymously or under a pseudonym, and use that freedom on a regular basis.  And if my name were so unique as to cause me problems, changing it is about $250. [1] [2] If there is such a thing as a "real name" -- I'm unconvinced -- then Griffin Boyce is mine.

Hello Cecilia,
   This is the relevant thread on tor-project:    As you can see, the emphasis is on off-topic posts and not the members' personal beliefs.  Though having my inbox overrun with more than 300 messages filled with the most ludicrous rape apologetics was certainly a factor in my decision to ask for the ability to remove    Senpai isn't going to notice you bro.
