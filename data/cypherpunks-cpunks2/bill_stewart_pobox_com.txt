Current quantum computers aren't that big, but they're only good for multiplying numbers up to 15 (I've heard rumors of 21!)
As with the early Cray supercomputers, where the size of the air conditioners and power systems were much larger than the round wirey bits,
a quantum computer is likely to be pretty small but may have some bigger helium coolers on-site.
Remember that you're trying to entangle subatomic particles, and maybe have some magnetic detector things that still aren't all that big.
If quantum computers became practical, they'd be using them to crack codes, factoring 1024-bit numbers or whatever.
What's really big are the NON-quantum computers they'd be using to attack those problems now.
The reason they need all that space is almost certainly for conventional data storage and processing.
They want to be able to collect and store everybody's phone calls, locations, credit card purchases, and internet traffic,
so they're handling multiple petabytes of data a day, finding the interesting bits,
correlating the interesting people with other people who might have been in the same place at the same time,
saving the parts that might be useful later.  Maybe doing some voice recognition on all their phone calls.
It takes a lot of basic horsepower and storage, and the correlation takes a lot of memory.
I think they've bought themselves a lot of cheap-ass electrical work, done by people who assume that
scaling up power requirements for a conventional data center by a factor of 10-100 doesn't change the principles.

One reason Firefox is highly fingerprintable is that it sends a list of your available fonts to the web server so the server can format its pages with cool fonts instead of boring fonts if you're able to read them.  That often turns out to be surprisingly unique, at least if you like fonts, and AFAIK it's not just the fonts you've configured into your browser, it's the fonts configured into your computer.
For instance, my work PC has a font for the $DAYJOB corporate logo, and has since acquired a couple more fonts so I can display their newer marketing presentations correctly in Powerpoint, plus it's got the dozen or two different monospace console fonts I was trying out to find a good one for programming use, and the usual collection of Bocklin and Dwarvish and Tibetan that old hippies usually have on our computers, just in case we might need to count to nine billion or have an appropriate password entry form.  When I first tested it with the panopticlick tool, it was unique; there are now a couple other similar machines (but that's "my machine's IE", "my machine's Firefox", and "my machine running Win7 with the Long Term Support version of Firefox that Corporate IT department makes us use", so it's still unique in reality.)
Sure would be nice if Mozilla had an option for "only announce the standard vanilla web fonts".

He might have had more specific knowledge

the DotCom boom was going through, the telcos had just done a huge round of
overbuilding on fiber, there was a glut of the stuff because everybody
was doing it, and DWDM (dense wavelength division multiplexing) meant that
you had to pour a huge amount of new capital into optical hardware on the endpoints
just to keep up with the Joneses, because the price per bit-mile of the

If by "right from the start" you're including "back in ~1987, when I was on standards committees that were specifying SGML for their applications", then yes, the trainwreck was around then, even before HTML or the web.  "Computer-Aided Logistics Support", aka CALS, was trying to address standards for handling documentation, mainly for the aircraft business and military contractors; you couldn't fit the design and maintenance documentation for a typical cargo airplane into the airplane itself.
The people who got the concept wanted to be able to do things like have maintenance manuals that you could read on whatever display you had, whether it's a high-res computer terminal or a monospaced wrist-mounted screen when you were standing on a ladder working on an engine, and you'd have objects like "a 2nd-level header".
The people who didn't get it wanted to be able to have data formats that could keep track of page numbers (so you could replicate taking the old page 1435.2 out of a 3-ring binder and replace it with an updated version), and objects like "a line of 14-point bold-faced text."
We ended up with some botched DTD that sort of let you do both, badly.  Graphics were supposed to be in a portable vector-based format, but they didn't have that finished while I was still working on that committee.  And eventually Sir Tim came up with HTML, which was sort of like a simplified DTD that did basic markup mostly correctly (plus hypertext and forms entry!), though with bitmapped pictures, and later people started to botch it up by letting you specify specific fonts and layouts (even if the reader's display didn't look like the author's), and Javascript to try to plaster over the botches, and it's been unsafely downhill from there.

Zeroaccess was a botnet that did a bunch of things, such as fake ad clicks and Bitcoin mining.
A DNS sinkhole was created to attack its DNS-based communications, which took out about 1/3 of the botnet.
One side issue that I found interesting, besides the usual security stuff, was the assertion that

machines, while only generating $2,165 a day."
What does this say about the future of Bitcoin mining?
I'm guessing that the botnet only mined on CPUs, not on GPUs,
because doing GPU calculations requires adapting code to different kinds of hardware
and is likely to have visible effects on the screen if you're not careful,
but even so, does this mean that Bitcoin miners who want to make a profit
are going to need to dump general-purpose machines in favor of specialized hardware
such as FPGAs or ASICs?  Or is buying a high-end GPU still good enough?

Anarchism's a great thing, but if you're trying to run an actual economy,
you need to make it workable for economic reasons, not just ideological ones.
Now that mining takes actual work and non-trivial amounts of electricity,
and there are enough bitcoins on the market that you can just buy them,
people are only going to do it if they can make a profit.
(If the market gets big enough that there aren't enough bitcoins
circulating to meet demand, the price goes up,
and maybe mining becomes profitable again.)

@_subject: Curious RNG stalemate [was: use of cpunks] 
First of all, lots of important hardware doesn't have ports on it,
particularly virtual machines, which have a whole raft of issues
even if you're running them on a server you physically control rather than
somebody else's cloud service.  The server has some ports,
but you need to make sure your hypervisor and clients have drivers that
will let the client access the hypervisor's /dev/random or equivalent.
VMware will have to do their own; you might contribute to OpenStack.
Another important kind of hardware where that doesn't work are
home routers, because the market price of $29-99 can't support much
extra money for randomness hardware; if it's not in the ARM core
or whatever other low-power cheap CPU, then it's only going to be
able to extract entropy from timing and network traffic,
and there's unlikely to be a high-precision clock chip.
Maybe you can get the manufacturer to burn a pseudo-random number
into the box along with the ethernet MAC or something,
but otherwise it's going to have to be software.
(So maybe you can augment Tomato/WRT-11/etc to listen for traffic
for a while before starting, and write an app for your PC
that beacons some entropy for the router to listen to?)
As far as your entropy dongle goes, the only way to get it cheap
is to make large volumes, which means you need a device that's
intended for some other application, like a $20 TV tuner/audio frob
or a webcam in a dark can getting CCD noise, or a webcam you wave at.
If you want speed, you need USB, not serial, but that's fine,
because almost nobody's including real serial ports these days.
If you want slow, you can get a geiger counter from Sparkfun/etc. for ~$99,
but you're not going to get anything intentionally radioactive shipped cheap from China.

That's particularly true if you're getting cheap electronic hardware
manufactured in China.  Not because of security risks, but just because
a lot of people who've gotten cheap stuff built over there have found
that the local manufacturers often "improve" designs to make them
more manufacturable or substitute parts for stuff they've got on hand.

Why should a customer buy from you instead of directly from the non-US party?
If you can find a way to only have service compromised if you're BOTH compromised, that might let you add some value, but otherwise you're just a consultant.
If your certificate is for signatures only (e.g. on DH keyparts), not for encryption,
you've got a much stronger case to make in court.
And it's much tougher for them to argue "contempt" if you do have to cave and give them
your signature key but then generate a new one and start using it,
as long as you don't destroy the old one (which would potentially be destroying evidence.)
The question is whether they can force you to retain the DH keyparts.

She had a summer job one year translating a chunk of telco billing data

Seven years later it was no longer lawsuit bait,

Remember that you're trying to entangle subatomic particles, and maybe have some magnetic detector things that still aren't all that big.
If quantum computers became practical, they'd be using them to crack codes, factoring 1024-bit numbers or whatever.
What's really big are the NON-quantum computers they'd be using to attack those problems now.
The reason they need all that space is almost certainly for conventional data storage and processing.
They want to be able to collect and store everybody's phone calls, locations, credit card purchases, and internet traffic,
so they're handling multiple petabytes of data a day, finding the interesting bits,
correlating the interesting people with other people who might have been in the same place at the same time,
saving the parts that might be useful later.  Maybe doing some voice recognition on all their phone calls.
It takes a lot of basic horsepower and storage, and the correlation takes a lot of memory.
I think they've bought themselves a lot of cheap-ass electrical work, done by people who assume that
scaling up power requirements for a conventional data center by a factor of 10-100 doesn't change the principles.

One reason Firefox is highly fingerprintable is that it sends a list of your available fonts to the web server so the server can format its pages with cool fonts instead of boring fonts if you're able to read them.  That often turns out to be surprisingly unique, at least if you like fonts, and AFAIK it's not just the fonts you've configured into your browser, it's the fonts configured into your computer.
For instance, my work PC has a font for the $DAYJOB corporate logo, and has since acquired a couple more fonts so I can display their newer marketing presentations correctly in Powerpoint, plus it's got the dozen or two different monospace console fonts I was trying out to find a good one for programming use, and the usual collection of Bocklin and Dwarvish and Tibetan that old hippies usually have on our computers, just in case we might need to count to nine billion or have an appropriate password entry form.  When I first tested it with the panopticlick tool, it was unique; there are now a couple other similar machines (but that's "my machine's IE", "my machine's Firefox", and "my machine running Win7 with the Long Term Support version of Firefox that Corporate IT department makes us use", so it's still unique in reality.)
Sure would be nice if Mozilla had an option for "only announce the standard vanilla web fonts".

"Computer-Aided Logistics Support", aka CALS, was trying to address standards for handling documentation, mainly for the aircraft business and military contractors; you couldn't fit the design and maintenance documentation for a typical cargo airplane into the airplane itself.
The people who got the concept wanted to be able to do things like have maintenance manuals that you could read on whatever display you had, whether it's a high-res computer terminal or a monospaced wrist-mounted screen when you were standing on a ladder working on an engine, and you'd have objects like "a 2nd-level header".

Anarchism's a great thing, but if you're trying to run an actual economy,
you need to make it workable for economic reasons, not just ideological ones.
Now that mining takes actual work and non-trivial amounts of electricity,
and there are enough bitcoins on the market that you can just buy them,
people are only going to do it if they can make a profit.
(If the market gets big enough that there aren't enough bitcoins
circulating to meet demand, the price goes up,
and maybe mining becomes profitable again.)

First of all, lots of important hardware doesn't have ports on it,
particularly virtual machines, which have a whole raft of issues
even if you're running them on a server you physically control rather than
somebody else's cloud service.  The server has some ports,
but you need to make sure your hypervisor and clients have drivers that
will let the client access the hypervisor's /dev/random or equivalent.
VMware will have to do their own; you might contribute to OpenStack.
Another important kind of hardware where that doesn't work are
home routers, because the market price of $29-99 can't support much
extra money for randomness hardware; if it's not in the ARM core
or whatever other low-power cheap CPU, then it's only going to be
able to extract entropy from timing and network traffic,
and there's unlikely to be a high-precision clock chip.
Maybe you can get the manufacturer to burn a pseudo-random number
into the box along with the ethernet MAC or something,
but otherwise it's going to have to be software.
(So maybe you can augment Tomato/WRT-11/etc to listen for traffic
for a while before starting, and write an app for your PC
that beacons some entropy for the router to listen to?)
As far as your entropy dongle goes, the only way to get it cheap
is to make large volumes, which means you need a device that's
intended for some other application, like a $20 TV tuner/audio frob
or a webcam in a dark can getting CCD noise, or a webcam you wave at.
If you want speed, you need USB, not serial, but that's fine,
because almost nobody's including real serial ports these days.
If you want slow, you can get a geiger counter from Sparkfun/etc. for ~$99,
but you're not going to get anything intentionally radioactive shipped cheap from China.

Seven years later it was no longer lawsuit bait,

@_subject: Silk Road founder arrested ... 
A surprising number of things *were* compromised,
not even counting the known FBI malware attacks on the Tor network.
If you read the indictment, there are a lot of email messages
between DPR and various other people, implying either that
DPR's mailbox has been seized (and that he saved a lot of messages
that would be really dumb to save)
or that many of the participants were actually Feds or informants
(boy, would that be a surprise :-)
or that the Feds have been monitoring communications on
Silk Road's email for a while that I'd expect to have been private,
in addition to monitoring open communications (drug ads, etc.),
which says they've either compromised Silk Road or Tor.
Also, somebody had said that the alleged hit on the extortionist competitor
wasn't in the indictment, just the press release; that's incorrect.
It's described in a fair bit of detail (including the Somewhere, BC police
saying that there weren't actually any dead bodies lying around),
in ways that sound almost like the extortionist and hit men were really cops;
it wouldn't be a bad strategy for finding DPR if they'd wanted to do it,
but you'd think they'd need to report that in the indictment if they had.
Alternatively, the email systems were hopelessly compromised,
to an extent that I'm glad I didn't try to buy any "research chemicals" in Silk Road.
Events have superseded my travel to a working Wifi hotspot :-)
Ken at Popehat explains that there are two indictments,
one in NY and one in MD, and at least the MD one indicates that the alleged hit was against a Federal witness,
so it's possible that they've got some of the data directly from a participant;
there's also speculation that the whole "witness" thing may have been a scam by an ex-employee.
(On a side note, it's kind of frustrating that the correct capitalization of Tor is "Tor";
makes it hard to distinguish cypherpunks mail from mail about
Tor Books, the science fiction oriented publishing company :-)

Sure, and if you like playing with Arduinos and similar electronics, it'd be a good experiment.
The main issues you run into (besides getting a decent fast USB interface without having to use surface-mount electronics, which are annoying to solder),
are validating the quality of the randomness and getting enough speed to be useful (which depends not only on your noise quality but also on whether you're using a USB-enabled chip or just bit-banging.
DieHard  is probably still the standard quality test - your noise is almost certain to be biased, rather than purely uniform, so you'll need to whiten the data and adjust your entropy estimates appropriately.

@_subject: hardware RNG 
Except for security purposes, most people who need a lot of random numbers are doing things like simulation or generating events in games, so they need a source with very good statistics about independence and uncorrelatedness, but don't mind if it's predictable (and in fact being predictable can be useful, since you can run the same random data stream against different versions of your application and see if it performed better or worse).  For those people, a statistically good pseudorandom number generator is usually just fine, and if it's cryptographically secure that's nice but only because crypto stuff needs to be statistically good.  Fast on-chip hardware random number generation is useful to non-security people because it's also likely to be statistically good.
Security's different, of course.  In a typical client-server or peer-to-peer environment, a client or peer isn't going to be generating a lot of random session keys per second, much less a lot of high-strength long-term-use public keys, so the only reason performance matters is that you don't want the user to use a too-short key because generating a long enough key would have taken 15 minutes or required them to wave a mouse around for a long time.  A web server or mail server or sometimes a peer with a lot of traffic (e.g. a Tor node) is a different case; they might handle enough traffic that fast strong hardware random number generation is necessary, and they're also the more interesting targets for Bad Guys to attack.

I don't know how many bits/second you're getting out of it,
but it's definitely high quality entropy, one real bit per bit,
assuming they don't reuse the intervals.
(It's ok to use t3 as the starting point for the next two intervals,
so      bit2 = ( (t4-t3) < (t5-t4) ),
but not bit2 = ( (t3-t2) < (t4-t3) ), which would be correlated with bit1.)

Fundamentally, what you're asking for doesn't make sense.
Threat models are about economics, scale, and mistakes,
and even if we don't have security bugs, we still have economics.
The internet is designed to be a system that lets everybody
in the world talk to everybody else, without pre-arranged connections,
with enough bandwidth to say the things they want to say
(e.g. watch cat videos on YouTube funded by advertising.)
Spread-spectrum radio is great for short distance concentration;
we most commonly use it in wifi or cellular phone technologies,
but then that data gets concentrated by long-haul fiber and routing providers.
Content traditionally gets handled by end users, but in practice
by a bunch of service providers who have economies of scale
that provide concentrated data to advertisers or low operating costs.
The recent internet security attacks have been based on scale,
though they've sometimes taken advantage of security mistakes as well.
Endpoint service providers can be forced to give up content and addresses;
transport service providers can be forced to give up address pairs,
traffic volumes, and sometimes end user identities, and in some cases
can also be forced to divulge content.
You have to fight scale threats with scale defenses.
If you want to get security at vaguely current internet prices
(e.g. tens of dollars per mbps per month instead of thousands),
you'll still need to piggyback on the existing infrastructure.
So you'll need to do encrypted tunnels over it,
with lots of endpoints (to make traffic analysis harder),
limited information visible to the endpoints,
and ways to make compromising endpoints harder.
That means technologies like TOR and remailers,
and one of the risks is finding that half the TOR nodes
are actually run by the KGB/FBI/other attackers.
The way to change scale is to move from communications networks
that can be wiretapped wholesale to types that can only be
wiretapped one at a time (e.g. 1024-bit DH PFS is better than
subpoenaable reusable 2048-bit RSA keys.)
You can do some jurisdictional arbitrage, if you know that the
NSA not only won't be wiretapping your server in Europe,
but also that they won't be trading favors with the local European spooks.
But it seems like that's a mug's game these days.
None of that means that it wouldn't be fun to build UUCP-over-IPSEC,
but if you and your buddy Bob are the only two users,
it's still susceptible to traffic analysis.

The main issues you run into (besides getting a decent fast USB interface without having to use surface-mount electronics, which are annoying to solder),
are validating the quality of the randomness and getting enough speed to be useful (which depends not only on your noise quality but also on whether you're using a USB-enabled chip or just bit-banging.

Except for security purposes, most people who need a lot of random numbers are doing things like simulation or generating events in games, so they need a source with very good statistics about independence and uncorrelatedness, but don't mind if it's predictable (and in fact being predictable can be useful, since you can run the same random data stream against different versions of your application and see if it performed better or worse).  For those people, a statistically good pseudorandom number generator is usually just fine, and if it's cryptographically secure that's nice but only because crypto stuff needs to be statistically good.  Fast on-chip hardware random number generation is useful to non-security people because it's also likely to be statistically good.
Security's different, of course.  In a typical client-server or peer-to-peer environment, a client or peer isn't going to be generating a lot of random session keys per second, much less a lot of high-strength long-term-use public keys, so the only reason performance matters is that you don't want the user to use a too-short key because generating a long enough key would have taken 15 minutes or required them to wave a mouse around for a long time.  A web server or mail server or sometimes a peer with a lot of traffic (e.g. a Tor node) is a different case; they might handle enough traffic that fast strong hardware random number generation is necessary, and they're also the more interesting targets for Bad Guys to attack.

The primary reasons for text encoding were that people wanted to transmit data through channels that might modify content or had limitations on the size and type of content, such as 7-bit ASCII, special interpretations of control characters, especially \r, \n, \0, \t, conversion to/from EBCDIC or other character sets, line length limitations, case-folding, multiple space compaction, parity bits, etc.  A secondary goal is to support transcription by humans or optical character readers that are likely to make mistakes on some similar-looking characters, but that's much less common.  A tertiary goal is that some programmers like to "improve" programs or make them "more efficient" by twiddling bits in ways that lead to software bugs, security holes, and the wrong kinds of chaos and anarchy, and yes I'm particularly including Phil Zimmerman and the standards committees who designed ASN.1 and DNS. To give those guys some slack, most of us started programming before the 8-bit byte was really universal and saving bytes here and there was *really* *important*.*
The most common encodings out there encode most of the characters in base-16 (or octal, for old DEC applications) or base-64 (uuencode and MIME), with various wrappers around them to handle line-length limitations and sometimes checksums.  Sadly, base-85 didn't catch on - it used 5 characters to hold 4 bytes, vs. base-64's 6 characters for 4 bytes, but it was late to the game and required doing multiplication and division instead of just bit-shifting.
I've never seen base-29 or base-59 encodings - is base-29 some attempt to fit into 5-level Baudot coding now that the deaf community have pretty much all moved off Model-28 TTY emulators to ASCII or mobile phone texting?
Base-4096 in UTF-8 would be silly - it gets you 12 bits per variable-width character, requiring at least two bytes, so you could just as well use two bytes of base-64 and not risk munging by systems that don't understand UTF-8.
(* My first programming environment had a printer with 132 48-character type bars and Model 026 keypunches doing Hollerith cards, which could print 56 different characters; I don't think we did any hacks using non-printer-supported punchcard fields and the card sorter, but it was possible.)

Of *course* they'd want to label it 'jury tampering', because it *is* jury tampering.
It's an offer to bribe the jurors to acquit somebody they might otherwise convict.
It directly runs afoul of jury tampering laws, and the only difference from
traditional jury tampering is that it *might* be easier not to get caught.
I do prefer it to some other traditional kinds of jury tampering,
including the one where the government only allows prosecution-friendly jurors,
and the one where the payment for acquittal is "not getting your legs broken".
(The latter, btw, also has some anonymity built into the payment mechanism,
since it's easy to deliver the payment anonymously to jurors who accept.)

And stubbornness had, ummm, entirely nothing to do with either of our positions...

This is Cypherpunks, and we've got plenty of appropriate things to troll about.
I was driving the other day, and caught part of Obama's weasel-speech about how he's issuing orders to the NSA not to get caught so blatantly.  Had to turn it off, because throwing things at the radio while driving isn't safe.  I might have been able to sit through more of it if I'd been home on my couch with enough beer to do the "drink if he says something blatantly ridiculous" bingo game, or at the bar at Shmoocon or something.

My email client is set to sort messages by date but group them by recent conversation:
So five years later, bitcoins are a thing, and I hope Eugen mined a bunch of them when they were easy.
I recently tried installing a Dogecoin wallet and miner on a spare lab machine at work.
Dogecoin's a really non-serious Litecoin variant that's mostly not worth anything (something like US$0.0001 - Wow, such coins!), mainly used for tipping authors of Reddit articles about cryptocurrencies, and I figured it would be ok to run it for experimentation because its near-zero value doesn't count as "using work resources to make money" (Wow! Much electrons!)
I've found a couple of interesting things running it.
- Litecoin uses scrypt, which was designed to not fit into ASICs or GPUs, so people with regular PCs could still mine it, without being crowded out by commercial miners.  It turns out that people have figured out how to fit it into GPUs, which still run about 10-100 times as fast as CPU mining, so if I wanted to actually make money mining $25 Litecoins I should buy a $100 graphics card; it's not worth it for Dogecoins.  (Woof!)
- The spare desktop lab machine has Intel 965 motherboard graphics GPU; there don't seem to be any miners for it, unlike the AMD and nVidia GPUs, so it's only running CPU mining.  Ok for Doge chow - much coins!
- While running background CPU-burning number-crunchers on a laptop is probably just as bad an idea today as it was when I was crunching Mersenne primes in the 90s, because of heat and battery problems, I haven't been able to verify whether that's still true today.  My work laptop has an nVidia GPU, but not one of the high-end ones, and an 8-core i7 CPU, and McAfee Anti-Virus seems to think the mining programs are malware, so I haven't been able to test either one with binaries; maybe it'll let me run it if I compile the source myself.
- The network security people at work contacted me :-)  The firewall thinks Port 22556 is some kind of botnet, and they got hits from my lab machine to random countries around the world.  After running anti-virus to make them happy, I checked tcpdump, and Dogewallet-qt uses that port to stay on the net and send and receive money; turning it on and off turns traffic to that port on and off.  I'll have to check the source code and verify it, but I'm assuming it's on purpose, rather than a malicious binary distributed by the official Dogecoin site or one I picked up by accident.   The miner doesn't have that issue - I'm using it with a mining pool, talking to one server over a fairly standard port.
So *coin runs over a distributed service that looks a lot like a botnet.  Makes sense, I guess.

No, that one was never litigated, just administratively ignored.
I was half-tempted to submit a FOIA request saying
         "Where's Raph's T-Shirt?"
because his ITAR request for an export permit for the shirt
was neither approved nor denied (or at least, it hadn't been
replied to at all for quite a long time at that point.)
It could only have been litigated if either he'd taken it to court
or else they'd charged somebody with a crime for exporting it.
Money might not exactly be "speech", but it's certainly "press".
It's how you get your speech out to people who might listen to it.
I get really tired of the kinds of people whose justification for
censoring porn on the internet is
         "the first amendment's only about political speech"
but when somebody actually wants to use it for political speech
         "no, can't do that, elections are WAY too important to let
         JUST ANYBODY say JUST ANYTHING they want!"
         Roberts's real attraction for Bush was that he believes
         that anything the Executive Branch wants to do is Just Fine.
         He's probably more radical than Scalia about that.
         But while we're probably stuck with Roberts for the rest of my lifetime,
         the Court's balances can still change.
Given Global Warming, it'll probably be what we used to call "winter"...

IANAL, but I suspect that a judge who allows a case to get as far as asking the defendents how they plead isn't going to reject a guilty plea.  Another way to do what the Quakers wanted to do would have been to plead "no contest" instead of guilty, but I'm sure they had deeply considered what to do beforehand.

The primary reasons for text encoding were that people wanted to transmit data through channels that might modify content or had limitations on the size and type of content, such as 7-bit ASCII, special interpretations of control characters, especially \r, \n, \0, \t, conversion to/from EBCDIC or other character sets, line length limitations, case-folding, multiple space compaction, parity bits, etc.  A secondary goal is to support transcription by humans or optical character readers that are likely to make mistakes on some similar-looking characters, but that's much less common.  A tertiary goal is that some programmers like to "improve" programs or make them "more efficient" by twiddling bits in ways that lead to software bugs, security holes, and the wrong kinds of chaos and anarchy, and yes I'm particularly including Phil Zimmerman and the standards committees who designed ASN.1 and DNS. To give those guys some slack, most of us started programming before the 8-bit byte was really universal and saving bytes here and there was *really* *important*.*
The most common encodings out there encode most of the characters in base-16 (or octal, for old DEC applications) or base-64 (uuencode and MIME), with various wrappers around them to handle line-length limitations and sometimes checksums.  Sadly, base-85 didn't catch on - it used 5 characters to hold 4 bytes, vs. base-64's 6 characters for 4 bytes, but it was late to the game and required doing multiplication and division instead of just bit-shifting.
I've never seen base-29 or base-59 encodings - is base-29 some attempt to fit into 5-level Baudot coding now that the deaf community have pretty much all moved off Model-28 TTY emulators to ASCII or mobile phone texting?
Base-4096 in UTF-8 would be silly - it gets you 12 bits per variable-width character, requiring at least two bytes, so you could just as well use two bytes of base-64 and not risk munging by systems that don't understand UTF-8.
(* My first programming environment had a printer with 132 48-character type bars and Model 026 keypunches doing Hollerith cards, which could print 56 different characters; I don't think we did any hacks using non-printer-supported punchcard fields and the card sorter, but it was possible.)

I recently tried installing a Dogecoin wallet and miner on a spare lab machine at work.
Dogecoin's a really non-serious Litecoin variant that's mostly not worth anything (something like US$0.0001 - Wow, such coins!), mainly used for tipping authors of Reddit articles about cryptocurrencies, and I figured it would be ok to run it for experimentation because its near-zero value doesn't count as "using work resources to make money" (Wow! Much electrons!)
I've found a couple of interesting things running it.
- Litecoin uses scrypt, which was designed to not fit into ASICs or GPUs, so people with regular PCs could still mine it, without being crowded out by commercial miners.  It turns out that people have figured out how to fit it into GPUs, which still run about 10-100 times as fast as CPU mining, so if I wanted to actually make money mining $25 Litecoins I should buy a $100 graphics card; it's not worth it for Dogecoins.  (Woof!)
- The spare desktop lab machine has Intel 965 motherboard graphics GPU; there don't seem to be any miners for it, unlike the AMD and nVidia GPUs, so it's only running CPU mining.  Ok for Doge chow - much coins!
- While running background CPU-burning number-crunchers on a laptop is probably just as bad an idea today as it was when I was crunching Mersenne primes in the 90s, because of heat and battery problems, I haven't been able to verify whether that's still true today.  My work laptop has an nVidia GPU, but not one of the high-end ones, and an 8-core i7 CPU, and McAfee Anti-Virus seems to think the mining programs are malware, so I haven't been able to test either one with binaries; maybe it'll let me run it if I compile the source myself.
- The network security people at work contacted me :-)  The firewall thinks Port 22556 is some kind of botnet, and they got hits from my lab machine to random countries around the world.  After running anti-virus to make them happy, I checked tcpdump, and Dogewallet-qt uses that port to stay on the net and send and receive money; turning it on and off turns traffic to that port on and off.  I'll have to check the source code and verify it, but I'm assuming it's on purpose, rather than a malicious binary distributed by the official Dogecoin site or one I picked up by accident.   The miner doesn't have that issue - I'm using it with a mining pool, talking to one server over a fairly standard port.
So *coin runs over a distributed service that looks a lot like a botnet.  Makes sense, I guess.

No, that one was never litigated, just administratively ignored.
I was half-tempted to submit a FOIA request saying
         "Where's Raph's T-Shirt?"
because his ITAR request for an export permit for the shirt
was neither approved nor denied (or at least, it hadn't been
replied to at all for quite a long time at that point.)
It could only have been litigated if either he'd taken it to court
or else they'd charged somebody with a crime for exporting it.
Money might not exactly be "speech", but it's certainly "press".
It's how you get your speech out to people who might listen to it.
I get really tired of the kinds of people whose justification for
censoring porn on the internet is
         "the first amendment's only about political speech"
but when somebody actually wants to use it for political speech
         "no, can't do that, elections are WAY too important to let
         JUST ANYBODY say JUST ANYTHING they want!"
         Roberts's real attraction for Bush was that he believes
         that anything the Executive Branch wants to do is Just Fine.
         He's probably more radical than Scalia about that.
         But while we're probably stuck with Roberts for the rest of my lifetime,
         the Court's balances can still change.
Given Global Warming, it'll probably be what we used to call "winter"...
