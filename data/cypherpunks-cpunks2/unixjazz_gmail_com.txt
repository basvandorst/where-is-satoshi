Dear *
I am sending you a call for papers for a workshop on free software, free
culture, and open access.
We are planning to have a whole track of our program dedicated for Aaron
Swartz, called 'Academia Livre' (Free University).
We are accepting suggestions of activists who can talk about Free
Software tools for scientific research.
Send your contributions and suggestions to us in case you are interested!
all the best,
Luis Felipe.
The International Free Software Workshop (WSL) is a scientific event
which takes place within the International Free Software Forum (FISL).
Since 2000, FISL is organized by Free Software activists in Porto
Alegre, Brazil, and represents one of the biggest and most important
FOSS conferences in the world.
WSL welcomes papers from different disciplinary traditions, offering the
opportunity for professors, researchers, students, and other
professionals to present and discuss original research developed at
research centers, companies, or universities which develop, use,
disseminate, and/or reflect critically upon FOSS in its technical,
legal, socioeconomic, and cultural aspects. This call for papers can be
found translated in other languages at: Information for Authors
