Unless when it's not an improvement. False privacy promises are worse
than no promises.
Both WhatsApp + TextSecure are centralized systems (which also happen to
want full access to you contacts list). So it's actually a radical
deterioration compared the decentralized protocols we built all these years.
It's not about ideological purity. It's usually the "realists" who
choose the easy path of building closed silos instead of getting their
hands dirty and improve existing working technologies.

Well.. you can't be sure if you don't have the source code ;) (see below).
I think that's a different app [1]. There is no mention for source code
on the official website. [2]

Since this is mostly for synchronous communication, you can inflict jabber+otr, which has all the benefits you mention above.

Hello is part of Firefox's codebase, so yes it's fully Open Source.
Same goes for EME. The Firefox implementation is Open Source.

I guess you are talking about the CDM module. Yes, that's not Open Source, but that doesn't ship along with Firefox. It's pretty much the same as with NPAPI plugins. Implementation is Open Source, but (for instance) Flash plugin is not. Thus it's not shipped with Firefox.
