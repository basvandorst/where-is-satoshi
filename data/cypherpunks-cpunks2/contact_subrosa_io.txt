@_subject: New end to end encrypted IM/VOIP web app focused on ease of use 
Subrosa is an open source, end to end encrypted messaging / VOIP app focused on being easy to use for the general public. We made Subrosa in response to the mass surveillance revelations programs, and to address the difficulty of current tools for the average user. Oh, and it supports group video chats.
Site, and hosted version to try it out: Why make something new?
We've tried getting our non-techie contacts to use GPG/OTR/etc. Our personal experiences are that spending hours per person we want to talk to, teaching them how to use the tool, and helping them when they inevitably come across an issue (e.g. lose their keys) are just not practical. We think there's a place for an end to end encrypted messaging platform usable by *everyone*.
Furthermore, not everyone cares about crypto. Subrosa is just as easy to use as making a Skype account, while key generation, etc are all performed behind the scenes. For end to end encryption to be widely adopted, it needs to convince people who don't care about it as well. And that means it can't be any harder, or more confusing than popular offerings.
Subrosa does cryptography transparently, however we don't *hide* information such as fingerprints (so you can verify you're not being MITM attacked, by us). RSA keypairs are stored on our servers, with the private key being passed through PBKDF2 with the user password (not sent). Messages are encrypted using exchanged AES keys, with VOIP/video chats encrypted with SRTP.
We know web crypto, when executing code from a remote server, has grave security implications. For ease of use, we do have a hosted version. Subrosa's client is fully open source however, and you can (and should!) run a local copy of the client. We use the ForgeJS library. We're also fully committed to end to end encryption. We don't have any "gotchas" like iMessage being end to end for delivery, but storing the plaintext of messages in iCloud. We shouldn't have the ability to read any messages, in all circumstances (assuming local client).
Please let us know what you think about Subrosa, and pick at this :)

We just have one client. The hosted version is the client hosted by us, on our web server. You can access it at You can download the client code, and run it from your computer, or host it on your own web server. It's identical.
The difference is by hosting the code yourself, you can be assured that the correct code is being executed.  For RSA private keys, user settings, etc, they're all encrypted with the user password (through PBKDF2) before being sent to the server. The server is just a dumb pipe that stores and passes encrypted information we don't have the keys to. (Sorry, didn't cc the mailing list)

Thanks! Yes, that's correct. We're also looking into implementing forward secrecy in this asynchronous environment with support for large group chats.
Key management is another important aspect, and something that has a high learning curve for the average user. For Subrosa, we've tried to make globally accessible keyrings without compromising security. Each user has a profile blob, which contains their RSA private key, AES-GCM keys, and user settings. The profile blob is encrypted with a PBKDF2-derived key from the user password.
The encrypted profile blob is sync'd with the server. When logging in, the client is required to send a hash of the derived key (the server knows this as the client sends the hash during registration) before the server returns the encrypted blob to counter offline brute-forcing attacks on the password.

It would be useful for XRay to also attempt to counter information gathering by executing random, low-volume queries in the background. This is one of the only countermeasures to data mining, and when done responsibly (ie, low volume) it should still be able to have a significant effect on decreasing the accuracy and utility of the mined results without irresponsibly hogging resources.

4. How is the key stored on the user's device? Is it backed up by Android's Sync to Google's servers, or backed up by iCloud to Apple's servers? 5. Even if there is no backdoor right now, an automatic update can easily sneak in a "key escrow".
WhatsApp's "end to end encryption" is voodoo. You cannot expect security from closed source code, certainly not automatically updating closed source code.
