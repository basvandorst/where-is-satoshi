...and replies:
Of course I've heard of punitive punishment and CERTAINLY 'selective
enforcement', which IS how laws are enforced in my California coastal
tourist/college town, but it requires that the non-persecuted internet
providers sit idly by while their users are punished. NOT a good way to
keep current users or acquire new ones .
There have been instances here where the non-persecuted backed the
persecuted about local nuisance ordinances leading to their modification
or annulment.
The non-persecuted (Yuppies with dogs) successfully pressured the city
into quitting their selective enforcement of people who WERE being
persecuted for their pets downtown by often simply not LOOKING LIKE
'gentry' and confronting the judges with their disgust that such a law
as 'no dogs' should exist.
It would also be VERY HARD to get jury convictions IF the non-persecuted
internet providers scoffed a law en masse with impunity, and gubmint
went ahead with persecuting the other cohort without secret star
chamber-like trials for the proles.
At THAT point the gubmint may have bigger problems than site owners
ignoring a ban on Warrant Canaries.

aware of the "Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact", a non-agression pact between
Germany and the Soviet Union?     My
understanding is that this agreement allowed (and was intended to allow)
Germany to attack the Western European countries without fear of Russian
attack, and it did so.  The only thing which ended that agreement was
the attack by Germany on Russia in 1941.  The essay claims, "Hitler
would have crushed Britain in short order if he had not diverted
millions of German men to the invasion of the Soviet Union."  But
apparently the only reason Germany attacked Russia was because of its
inability to invade England, and there is absolutely no reason to
believe that Russia would have attacked Germany absent Germany's prior
attack on Russia.  So what was Brad Cabana smoking?Should we be
sympathetic to the Soviets in this matter?  There's an old joke about a
kid who kills his parents, and throws himself on the mercy of the judge,
claiming "But I'm an orphan!!!".
WHY it happened.  Yes, there was a Soviet "sacrifice", but it was made
necessary by the actions of the Soviets themselves.       Jim Bell
boycotting the parade for the 70th anniversary of the Soviet victory
over Germany in World War II that I just had to write on it. Recently,
the prime minister of the United Kingdom announced he will not be
attending the parade. Previous to that, countries like Germany and the
United States had announced the same. It's only a parade you say? No
it's more than that.
in World War II. A sacrifice beyond imagination, and far, far greater
than all the countries fighting Nazi Germany combined. In comparison,
the Holocaust, which is rightly remembered annually, claimed the lives
of six million people of the Jewish faith. These are really the two true
tragedy's of World War II unleashed on the world by Nazi Germany. The
stories of Soviet soldiers advancing without weapons to pickup the rifle
of the next dead soldier are well known. The bloodbath of Stalingrad,
the siege of Leningrad, the millions of Soviet soldiers killed and
captured (only to then die in POW camps) during the early days of the
German invasion, and so on, all markers of the brutality of man against
his own, stand large in the history of the world. In fact, the German
invasion of the Soviet Union stands as the largest military battle in
the history of man.
meant to honour that sacrifice. When Britain announced it would not
attend, well, that's the straw that broke the camel's back frankly. Of
all the countries in the world, Britain was saved by the massive waves
of young Soviet men and woman that bled the German army white. Hitler
would have crushed Britain in short order if he had not diverted
millions of German men to the invasion of the Soviet Union. Crucially,
the diversion of aircraft, fighters and bombers, to the Soviet front
saved Britain from the entire annihilation of a full blown, continuous
air campaign, and the subsequent naval invasion that would certainly
have occurred. In reality, the western allies left Stalin almost alone
in Europe to battle the Nazi's, and take the majority of the casualties
in doing so. By the time D-Day finally arrived, the German army and air
force was only a shadow of it's former self as it existed in 1941. As
bad and hard as it was for the allies to march east through Europe to
Berlin, without the Soviet people's sacrifice, it would have never happened.
go beyond ignorance. To quarrel with that is the hateful and arrogant
bastion of the very seeds that caused World War II in the first place.
And now, as if history is repeating itself, Western leaders have entered
that bastion of ignorance and arrogance to punish Russia for the
Ukrainian civil war. By contrast, Russian president Putin, despite the
ongoing conflict in Ukraine, attended the 70th anniversary of the D-Day
landings in France last year. He was given the proverbial cold shoulder
by western leaders, yet he subjected himself to that, in honour of the
sacrifice of the men of Canada, Britain and the United States. He did
not ignore the history or the price in blood of that action. He honoured
it. He put the sacrifice ahead of his political position, and it could
even be said his personal shunning. Now that the time is here to do the
same for the Soviet Union's dead, we cannot bring ourselves to do the same.
learned the lessons of history. That our political leadership has become
so petty, so detached from historical reality, that it attempts to
rewrite the history of 25 million souls. That is the danger of all of
this. Russians don't really need the West to honour their sacrifice.
They know it all too well. It's the West that needs to honour that
sacrifice so it can clearly see the dangers of war on a scale far more
destructive than anything it experienced on the western front, or
anywhere else in history. Poland started this train rolling by refusing
to invite the Russian president to the Holocaust remembrance at
Auschwitz last year. This despite the fact that the Soviet army
liberated all of Poland, and specifically Auschwitz from German armies.
Russians could ever say themselves. They have portrayed us as people who
refuse to honour the dead, those that gave their lives in another time
to defeat a tyrant bent on world domination, and in doing so dishonour
those men and women. As the son of a young man, training in England,
fighting in North Africa, Italy, Holland, and Germany through those
tumultuous years of war and senseless slaughter, I recognize the Soviet
sacrifice that probably saved my Dad's life. How could you not? Yet,
that is exactly what our politicians are doing today. You don't have to
be a lover of this country, or that country to recognize and honour
grave human injustice committed on a massive scale. You just have to be
humane, and subordinate your own bias in the remembrance of the fallen.
Is that really so hard? Isn't that what is expected of us all? Wouldn't
we expect that from our children? I've never been so ashamed of the
actions of our governments than I am now with the boycott of that parade
in Moscow.

    neck??!  How stupid do the Baltimore City Police think we are??!"
    (src, Brave New Films     )
Here's how the legal end is going...
The Baltimore police say they will NOT issue a report Friday as planned
 regarding the
death-in-detention of Freddie Gray: The report will be turned over to a
prosecutor, even as they leak 'evidence' Gray 'beat himself to death'
Snap analysis of what this means:
Baltimore’s District Attorney, like ALL court prosecutorial staff, works
for the police. The prosecutor gets to pick and choose what evidence a
Freddie Gray Grand Jury might hear, and you can be SURE the evidence
will not show the victim to be non-culpable for his own death.
Further, according to US Department of Just-Us “guidelines’
 “/Law enforcement
actions based on fear, panic, misperception or even poor judgement do
not constitute wilful conduct prosecutable under the statute/.”. Proof
of malicious intent to kill is required for a police officer’s murder
conviction in the United States, and since no one but police officers know…
Right now, the Baltimore Police department has ‘indirectly provided
that Freddie Gray beat himself to death banging his body against the
inside if the police van he was imprisoned in. Really?
The bottom line is this… If the public demands a murder charge in the
killing of Freddie Gray, or the prosecutor hypocritically charges the
officer/(s)/ with murder, the officer/(s)/ WILL be acquitted.
Expect no justice for Freddie Gray and you won’t be disappointed.

"The Baltimore police have murdered 109 people since 2010, and have
    paid out more than $6 million in police brutality settlements since
    2011. Now they want us to believe that ‪ broke his own
    neck??!  How stupid do the Baltimore City Police think we are??!"
    (src, Brave New Films     )
Here's how the legal end is going...
The Baltimore police say they will NOT issue a report Friday as planned
 regarding the
death-in-detention of Freddie Gray: The report will be turned over to a
prosecutor, even as they leak 'evidence' Gray 'beat himself to death'
Snap analysis of what this means:
Baltimore’s District Attorney, like ALL court prosecutorial staff, works
for the police. The prosecutor gets to pick and choose what evidence a
Freddie Gray Grand Jury might hear, and you can be SURE the evidence
will not show the victim to be non-culpable for his own death.
Further, according to US Department of Just-Us “guidelines’
 “/Law enforcement
actions based on fear, panic, misperception or even poor judgement do
not constitute wilful conduct prosecutable under the statute/.”. Proof
of malicious intent to kill is required for a police officer’s murder
conviction in the United States, and since no one but police officers know…
Right now, the Baltimore Police department has ‘indirectly provided
that Freddie Gray beat himself to death banging his body against the
inside if the police van he was imprisoned in. Really?
The bottom line is this… If the public demands a murder charge in the
killing of Freddie Gray, or the prosecutor hypocritically charges the
officer/(s)/ with murder, the officer/(s)/ WILL be acquitted.
Expect no justice for Freddie Gray and you won’t be disappointed.

Of course I've heard of punitive punishment and CERTAINLY 'selective
enforcement', which IS how laws are enforced in my California coastal
tourist/college town, but it requires that the non-persecuted internet
providers sit idly by while their users are punished. NOT a good way to
keep current users or acquire new ones .
There have been instances here where the non-persecuted backed the
persecuted about local nuisance ordinances leading to their modification
or annulment.
The non-persecuted (Yuppies with dogs) successfully pressured the city
into quitting their selective enforcement of people who WERE being
persecuted for their pets downtown by often simply not LOOKING LIKE
'gentry' and confronting the judges with their disgust that such a law
as 'no dogs' should exist.
It would also be VERY HARD to get jury convictions IF the non-persecuted
internet providers scoffed a law en masse with impunity, and gubmint
went ahead with persecuting the other cohort without secret star
chamber-like trials for the proles.
At THAT point the gubmint may have bigger problems than site owners
ignoring a ban on Warrant Canaries.

aware of the "Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact", a non-agression pact between
Germany and the Soviet Union?     My
understanding is that this agreement allowed (and was intended to allow)
Germany to attack the Western European countries without fear of Russian
attack, and it did so.  The only thing which ended that agreement was
the attack by Germany on Russia in 1941.  The essay claims, "Hitler
would have crushed Britain in short order if he had not diverted
millions of German men to the invasion of the Soviet Union."  But
apparently the only reason Germany attacked Russia was because of its
inability to invade England, and there is absolutely no reason to
believe that Russia would have attacked Germany absent Germany's prior
attack on Russia.  So what was Brad Cabana smoking?Should we be
sympathetic to the Soviets in this matter?  There's an old joke about a
kid who kills his parents, and throws himself on the mercy of the judge,
claiming "But I'm an orphan!!!".
WHY it happened.  Yes, there was a Soviet "sacrifice", but it was made
necessary by the actions of the Soviets themselves.       Jim Bell
boycotting the parade for the 70th anniversary of the Soviet victory
over Germany in World War II that I just had to write on it. Recently,
the prime minister of the United Kingdom announced he will not be
attending the parade. Previous to that, countries like Germany and the
United States had announced the same. It's only a parade you say? No
it's more than that.
in World War II. A sacrifice beyond imagination, and far, far greater
than all the countries fighting Nazi Germany combined. In comparison,
the Holocaust, which is rightly remembered annually, claimed the lives
of six million people of the Jewish faith. These are really the two true
tragedy's of World War II unleashed on the world by Nazi Germany. The
stories of Soviet soldiers advancing without weapons to pickup the rifle
of the next dead soldier are well known. The bloodbath of Stalingrad,
the siege of Leningrad, the millions of Soviet soldiers killed and
captured (only to then die in POW camps) during the early days of the
German invasion, and so on, all markers of the brutality of man against
his own, stand large in the history of the world. In fact, the German
invasion of the Soviet Union stands as the largest military battle in
the history of man.
meant to honour that sacrifice. When Britain announced it would not
attend, well, that's the straw that broke the camel's back frankly. Of
all the countries in the world, Britain was saved by the massive waves
of young Soviet men and woman that bled the German army white. Hitler
would have crushed Britain in short order if he had not diverted
millions of German men to the invasion of the Soviet Union. Crucially,
the diversion of aircraft, fighters and bombers, to the Soviet front
saved Britain from the entire annihilation of a full blown, continuous
air campaign, and the subsequent naval invasion that would certainly
have occurred. In reality, the western allies left Stalin almost alone
in Europe to battle the Nazi's, and take the majority of the casualties
in doing so. By the time D-Day finally arrived, the German army and air
force was only a shadow of it's former self as it existed in 1941. As
bad and hard as it was for the allies to march east through Europe to
Berlin, without the Soviet people's sacrifice, it would have never happened.
go beyond ignorance. To quarrel with that is the hateful and arrogant
bastion of the very seeds that caused World War II in the first place.
And now, as if history is repeating itself, Western leaders have entered
that bastion of ignorance and arrogance to punish Russia for the
Ukrainian civil war. By contrast, Russian president Putin, despite the
ongoing conflict in Ukraine, attended the 70th anniversary of the D-Day
landings in France last year. He was given the proverbial cold shoulder
by western leaders, yet he subjected himself to that, in honour of the
sacrifice of the men of Canada, Britain and the United States. He did
not ignore the history or the price in blood of that action. He honoured
it. He put the sacrifice ahead of his political position, and it could
even be said his personal shunning. Now that the time is here to do the
same for the Soviet Union's dead, we cannot bring ourselves to do the same.
learned the lessons of history. That our political leadership has become
so petty, so detached from historical reality, that it attempts to
rewrite the history of 25 million souls. That is the danger of all of
this. Russians don't really need the West to honour their sacrifice.
They know it all too well. It's the West that needs to honour that
sacrifice so it can clearly see the dangers of war on a scale far more
destructive than anything it experienced on the western front, or
anywhere else in history. Poland started this train rolling by refusing
to invite the Russian president to the Holocaust remembrance at
Auschwitz last year. This despite the fact that the Soviet army
liberated all of Poland, and specifically Auschwitz from German armies.
Russians could ever say themselves. They have portrayed us as people who
refuse to honour the dead, those that gave their lives in another time
to defeat a tyrant bent on world domination, and in doing so dishonour
those men and women. As the son of a young man, training in England,
fighting in North Africa, Italy, Holland, and Germany through those
tumultuous years of war and senseless slaughter, I recognize the Soviet
sacrifice that probably saved my Dad's life. How could you not? Yet,
that is exactly what our politicians are doing today. You don't have to
be a lover of this country, or that country to recognize and honour
grave human injustice committed on a massive scale. You just have to be
humane, and subordinate your own bias in the remembrance of the fallen.
Is that really so hard? Isn't that what is expected of us all? Wouldn't
we expect that from our children? I've never been so ashamed of the
actions of our governments than I am now with the boycott of that parade
in Moscow.

The journalist is NEVER supposed to be (and perhaps harder, 'become, in

There’s really nothing unethical about being with corpses in news

@_subject: The FBI, Carnegie-Mellon University, CERT/CC, and Tor 
From Just Security (legal):
Reports surfaced last month suggesting that Carnegie Mellon University
(CMU) has been helping
the FBI crack Tor, the secure browsing application used by
privacy-conscious Internet users for both legal and illegal activities.
Normally, an academic institution assisting law enforcement in fighting
crime wouldn’t raise any eyebrows, particularly if that assistance came
in the form of responding to subpoenas. But this isn’t your average
case. Beyond the complicated (and unclear) set of facts involved, CMU
houses the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center
(CERT/CC), one of the world’s most important hubs for coordinating
information about various cybersecurity vulnerabilities and attacks.
More than a month after the news first broke, the details are murky at
best. Tor has alleged
that the FBI paid CMU to crack the system’s anonymity feature in
exchange for payment. CMU’s own statement
about the incident says that many of the media reports have been
inaccurate, but acknowledges that the university — and by extension
CERT/CC — complies with valid subpoenas that it receives (as it must).
It also said that it receives “no funding for compliance.” The FBI has
that reports on the payment are inaccurate, but stopped short of saying
no payment was made. And Tor has responded
by saying that these vague responses raise a whole host of questions on
their own.
The public saga leading up to the recent accusations began in July 2014,
when Ed Felten, the then-director of Princeton’s Center for Information
Technology Policy, noted
that CERT/CC researchers at CMU had submitted a presentation abstract to
organizers of the Black Hat security conference discussing a new
vulnerability they had found in Tor. The timing of CERT/CC’s pitch to
Black Hat aligned with a large-scale attack on Tor that lasted from
January to July 2014, during which CERT/CC researchers shared only
“hints” about the vulnerability they had discovered. As for the
abstract, it was abruptly withdrawn in July when CMU failed to approve
the content of the talk for public release.
Eyebrows were again raised in January 2015, after the arrest
of a man who allegedly helped run Silk Road 2.0, a large online trading
post on the dark web whose visitors often use Tor to access the site. At
the time, some speculated that his arrest was tied to the attack against
Tor in the first half of 2014.
Most recently, in mid-November, Tor accused CMU of accepting payment and
assisting the FBI — in ways that indicate a warrant was not involved —
to “attack hidden services users in a broad sweep, and then sift through
their data to find people.” These allegations are hugely problematic for
CERT/CC. As an entity that espouses  to be
“a trusted, authoritative organization dedicated to improving the
security of computer systems and networks,” finding and not disclosing
vulnerabilities is a good way to undermine that trust. Exploiting those
vulnerabilities is even worse.
But let’s take a step back for a moment. Why, beyond the obvious privacy
concerns raised by Tor, is this such a big deal?
CERT/CC, and indeed the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)
community as a whole
is a pillar of global cybersecurity. (CSIRT is another term often used
to describe the type of organization CERT/CC is.) Generally, CSIRTs are
responsible for receiving, reviewing, and responding to computer
security incident reports from a set of clients, which can include
government agencies, private companies, security researchers, and
ordinary Internet users.
Since the late 1980s, CERT/CC, as the name suggests, has been a major
coordination center for global CSIRT activities. As as result, it has
access to a wide array of incident information and vulnerabilities,
which could, hypothetically, be used to help crack Tor’s anonymity
feature. In addition, the organization — initially funded as a DARPA
project and still funded  with federal money —
is largely transnational in nature and serves as the secretariat for
national CSIRTs, more than 100 of which are distributed across the globe.
CSIRTs are increasingly referenced in international discussions as a key
component in efforts to build global capacity to combat cybersecurity
threats and develop norms of behavior among nations in the cyber realm.
For example, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on
cybersecurity suggested
 this summer
that special teams authorized to respond to cybersecurity incidents,
such as CSIRTs, should not be used to “engage in malicious international
activity” and should not be the target of attacks. If CSIRTs are to be
held out as off limits, they need to be impartial (like, say, the Red
Cross ) and cannot be
political actors, lest they become legitimate targets.
CERT/CC, and many other CSIRTs around the world, collect information
that can be very useful for both identifying and capturing criminals.
They rely heavily
on the trust incident reporters and vulnerability researchers have in
the CSIRTs, trust that is garnered after developing close ties with the
constituencies they serve. When a CSIRT is discovered, or even rumored,
to be acting in a way that is negligent or undermines network security
of perfectly legal services, this bond of trust is fractured. Less trust
means less information for CSIRTs.
To pour salt on the wound, the controversy around the latest story
undermines the effectiveness of CERT/CC both to carry out its own duties
and to assist the FBI in the future. Though it is often not explicit in
documentation, a relationship between CSIRTs and law enforcement
agencies is often assumed. Indeed, such cooperation can be helpful for
both law enforcement and CSIRTs. Law enforcement can obtain important
technical information about incidents from CSIRTs, which in turn helps
law enforcement identify and pursue cyber-criminals. On the flipside,
some industries (particularly in the US) have close relationships with
law enforcement that result in law enforcement becoming an important
reporter of incidents to the CSIRT. But if these two types of bodies are
to have close working relationships, they should follow explicit and
transparent guidelines in accordance with due process. If the FBI is
engaging with CSIRTs to essentially break a feature of Internet security
en masse, it is making its own life more difficult down the line by
removing the legitimacy of a key ally in cyber criminal investigations.
To be clear: This is not an indictment of CSIRTs working with law
enforcement. As I explain in detail with my colleagues Isabel Skierka,
Mirko Hohmann, and Tim Maurer in our recent report
cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement is not necessarily a bad
thing. A comprehensive approach to addressing cybercrime would ideally
meld the technical expertise and access CSIRTs have painstakingly
developed with traditional law enforcement expertise found in agencies
like the FBI. In fact, many national-level CSIRTs actually sit within
law enforcement, intelligence, or national security organizations or
have formal liaisons with those agencies.
Indeed, most in the CSIRT community seem ready to accept that CSIRTs
have reached a point in their maturity where a formal, transparent
relationship with law enforcement is practicable. This is because the
quandary facing CSIRTs is one that has pervaded the American
intelligence community for decades: Some activities simply do not pass
the front-page test; meaning that some actions, when they come to light,
will hurt the reputation of the organization. As New America
Cybersecurity Fellow and Georgia Tech professor Peter Swire wrote
earlier this year
the half-life of secrets is diminishing, and interactions like CERT/CC’s
with the FBI are likely to become known much sooner than they would in
the past. For the CSIRT community, which relies so heavily on trust for
effectiveness, keeping their relationships with the government secret
will be both extremely difficult and may undermine their reputations
once they come to light.
The news of CMU’s possible assistance in compromising Tor’s most
critical feature, anonymity, presents an opportunity for many to attack
the integrity of CERT/CC and the researchers at the Software Engineering
Institute. Bruce Schneier
and others
have been quick to point out that this incident has erased (or at least
greatly diminished) CERT/CC’s hard-earned reputation as an honest
broker. It is certain to be a warning to other CSIRTs around the world
that they should transparently define their relationships with law
enforcement agencies.
Regardless of how fault should be apportioned in this particular
instance, the news comes as part of a larger trend in the CSIRT
community. Once relatively apolitical, these technical teams are
undergoing a process of politicization. National level CSIRTs, many of
which once resided outside of government in academic institutions and
non-governmental organizations, are being pulled into government
structures. At the same time, their relationships with law enforcement
agencies are becoming closer and (to those outside of the agencies) more
What can be done to protect the credibility and neutrality of these
important pillars in the network security ecosystem? The recommendations
we outline in our report provide a roadmap:
  * The first step to protect trust in these teams is to reverse the
    recent trend and /not/ place them under the control of law
    enforcement and intelligence agencies. Such agencies are
    incentivized to use the tools at their disposal to investigate
    crime, collect intelligence, and pursue threat groups, and thus will
    often disregard the apolitical information coordination role CSIRTs
    play.
  * Second, CSIRTs and law enforcement must more transparently define
    the terms of their cooperation, including how and under what
    circumstances they interact. They should also clearly define what
    kinds of information and expertise are exchanged and what
    direction(s) shared information flows.
  * Third, for CSIRTs to remain trusted brokers, they must clarify their
    mandates and missions. Traditionally, a CSIRT has placed remediating
    damage from incidents and returning systems to operation as top
    priorities. Is this still the case, or is CSIRT expertise being
    poured into combating cybercrime and assisting law enforcement
    agencies in developing tools and methods to discover criminals?
Finally, though not included in our recommendations in the report, to
recover the trust it has recently lost, CERT/CC’s mission and role needs
to be clearly defined by the organization itself, its funders, its
partners, and its constituency. Is it essentially a second US national
CSIRT alongside the Department of Homeland Security’s US-CERT
, or is it something closer to a private CSIRT
that plays a role in maintaining global cybersecurity? If it is a
global, non-government CSIRT, transparently defining its relationship
with law enforcement, intelligence, and other political actors — both
inside and outside the US — is all the more important.
In the end, the actions of the computer security professionals at
CERT/CC who allegedly aided the FBI are somewhat understandable. Their
overarching goal is to secure computer systems. The traditional CSIRT
approach focuses on technical identification and remediation of
incidents, in addition to promoting technical measures to protect
systems from attacks in the first place. The goal of law enforcement
bodies in cybersecurity is to lend a helping hand in preventing attacks
from taking place by rounding up the likely and past perpetrators. That
aligns with the CSIRT community’s goal. But the allegations of the
researchers’ work (the cybersecurity applicability of which is dubious
at best) to crack Tor demonstrate the damage that can be done when when
a CSIRT’s interaction with law enforcement is not openly and strictly
The controversy surrounding this story represents something much larger
than the alleged incident. CSIRTs are meant to be apolitical actors
concentrating on computer and network security. The ramifications of
politicization and muddied mandates could permeate up to states’ efforts
to develop international norms of behavior in cyberspace, like those
by the UN Group of Governmental Experts, that rely on the integrity and
independence of global CSIRTs. By undermining these norms before they
take root, the FBI, and by extension the US government, undermine their
own efforts to promote an open and secure cyberspace through norms for
responsible state behavior.

I wonder who could be doing this...
*Turkish Internet hit with massive DDoS attack*
By Efe Kerem Sozeri
Turkey  is under massive cyberattack. Since Monday morning, the country's official domain name servers have
been under a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack
. The
attack’s perpetrators are unknown, but it reveals the vulnerabilities of
the country’s Internet infrastructure.
All domain names that end with Turkey’s two-letter country code .tr
 must be registered by NIC.tr
an administration office in Turkey’s capital of Ankara. Besides its
registration duties, NIC.tr maintains the academic internet backbone for
Turkish universities. It’s also the main service for .tr domain names,
making it a valuable target.
On Monday morning Turkish time, traces of an attack became noticeable.
By noon, NIC.tr’s five nameservers, ns1.nic.tr through ns5.nic.tr,
werecompletely down under a 40 Gigabits per second DDoS  attack.
    .  Two of the routes
    hosting nic.tr experienced instability yesterday
    pic.twitter.com/OHk3dF0Bxo     — Dyn Research ( December 15, 2015
Europe’s regional Internet registry, the RIPE Network Coordination
Centre, serves as a secondary Domain Name System to Nic.tr. RIPE was
also severely affected
As noted
 by its
manager of the Global Information Infrastructure, Romero Zwart, the
attack was “modified to evade” RIPE's mitigation measures. As of this
writing, the attack is still going on at around 40 Gbps, disrupting
working hours
in Turkey.
DDoS attacks, which overload servers with requests for information, are
a simple way of disrupting a website for a brief amount of time. The
cost of hiring attacking
 botnets
, huge armies of compromised computers
that can all visit a site at the same time, is getting cheaper, and the
size of attacks is growing each year
. In
2013, an average DDoS attack was about 2 Gbps. In 2014, it’s nearly 8 Gbps.
While a 40 Gbps attack still sounds huge, security experts
say that even 400 Gbps attacks, like one recently reported
by DDoS mitigation service Cloudflare, are “the new normal.”
What makes the Turkish attack so damaging is the attackers’
sophisticated choice of target. By focusing on a relatively small group
of IP addresses, the five nameservers of NIC.tr, the attackers managed
to “take down the DNS system of a whole country with a 40 Gbps attack:”

    ulkenin alan adlari sisteminin cokmesi kabul edilemez               — Mehmet Akcin ( December 15, 2015
As the country’s official domain suffix, .tr domain names are very
popular in Turkey, and many local companies want their businesses
officially recognized for their local audience. There are about 400,000
websites  with
localized Turkish domain names, including 300,000 companies. It's also
used by government institutions, schools, municipalities, Turkish e-mail
servers , and the Turkish
When the attack left NIC.tr’s DNS service non-responding, practically
all .tr domain names became unreachable. Besides the private Turkish
companies, official government businesses such as vital population
registry queries, remained interrupted for more than a day. Internet
access at university campuses are still down or extremely slow.
On Monday evening, Turkey’sNational Response Center for Cyber Events
 closed all incoming traffic to NIC.tr from
outside of Turkey, which made 400,000 websites with .tr domain names
unreachable from the rest of the world, all e-mails sent to companies
and organisations with .tr domains bounced back with the “unknown host”
Response Center changed its policy late Monday night, and NIC.tr has
since been running a selective block policy for a number of suspected
root IP addresses. DNS service for .tr domains were also re-configured
 to
distribute the queries among public and private servers, including a
Turkish Internet service providers Superonline and Vodafone.
It’s notoriously difficult to attribute where a cyberattack comes from.
Many Turkish commentators have pointed to Russia
 as the source of the attack. Russia’s
cyber warfare capabilities
are an established weapon, believed to be used against Estonia in 2007
, Georgia in
and Ukraine in 2014
With Turkey’s recent downing of a Russian jet
 near Syrian border,
and with the ongoingtroll wars
between Erdoğan’s and Putin’s social media campaigners, DDoS botnets
could be the next battleground. Some experts have speculated this is a
response to Turkey’s nationalist cyber teams, who stand accused of
organising aDDoS attack on Russia’s Sputnik news
    It's highly probable that ddos attacks on nic.tr and tr ISPs are
    retaliation to recent      ddos attacks
    — Umut Simsek ( December 15, 2015
DDoS attacks are by nature distributed, therefore the identity of the
attackers could never be found out; but the consequences identified the
vulnerabilities of the target very well.

On January 8 2016 the US Supreme Court will consider a petition for
certiorari in the EPIC v. DHS "Standard Operating Procedure 303" FOIA
suit. SOP 303 is also known as the 'National Emergency Wireless Kill-Switch'
“Standard Operating Procedure 303,” is the protocol that codifies a
“shutdown and restoration process for use by commercial and private
wireless networks during national crisis.”
Moreover, the justices are expected to clarify: “the scope of FOIA’s
“Exemption 7(F),” which allows the government to withhold “records or
information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the
extent that the production of such law enforcement records or
information … could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or
physical safety of any individual.”
    The central question raised by Exemption 7(F) is whether the
government has to be able to identify with any specificity the
“individual” whose life or physical safety might be endangered by
disclosure of the requested law enforcement records. In 2008, the Second
Circuit answered that question in the affirmative in ACLU v. Dep’t of
Defense. In its February 2015 decision affirming the government’s
rejection of EPIC’s FOIA request, the D.C. Circuit held expressly to the
contrary. As I explain in the post that follows, not only is this
division of authority sufficiently important so as to justify the
Supreme Court’s intervention no matter how the Court ultimately rules,
but, in my view, the Second Circuit clearly has the better reading of
Exemption 7(F) as a matter of statutory purpose, structure, and policy.
    I.  The Second Circuit and the PNSDA
    The story begins with FOIA requests filed in 2003 by the ACLU and
other organizations seeking records related to the treatment and death
of detainees held in US custody overseas after September 11, and records
related to the practice of “rendering” some of those detainees to
countries known to use torture. The litigation over the ACLU’s request
eventually reduced to a dispute over at least 29 (and perhaps thousands
of) photographs of detainees and detainee abuse in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In June 2006, the district court ordered the release of 21 of those
photographs (with proper redactions to alleviate privacy objections),
and the government appealed, arguing that the photographs were covered
by Exemption 7(F) insofar as their release would likely incite violence
against US personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq.”

pack of lies (still being reiterated, recently in one major media outlet

something to 'sing and dance' about?

Osama was never heard at Tora Bora (per US dox showing the intel

lie about hearing him at the old NATO sigint eavesdropping facility

Afghanistan b/c "Russians" and "Communism" and then we let the Islamist

@_subject: The FBI, Carnegie-Mellon University, CERT/CC, and Tor 
From Just Security (legal):
Reports surfaced last month suggesting that Carnegie Mellon University
(CMU) has been helping
the FBI crack Tor, the secure browsing application used by
privacy-conscious Internet users for both legal and illegal activities.
Normally, an academic institution assisting law enforcement in fighting
crime wouldn’t raise any eyebrows, particularly if that assistance came
in the form of responding to subpoenas. But this isn’t your average
case. Beyond the complicated (and unclear) set of facts involved, CMU
houses the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center
(CERT/CC), one of the world’s most important hubs for coordinating
information about various cybersecurity vulnerabilities and attacks.
More than a month after the news first broke, the details are murky at
best. Tor has alleged
that the FBI paid CMU to crack the system’s anonymity feature in
exchange for payment. CMU’s own statement
about the incident says that many of the media reports have been
inaccurate, but acknowledges that the university — and by extension
CERT/CC — complies with valid subpoenas that it receives (as it must).
It also said that it receives “no funding for compliance.” The FBI has
that reports on the payment are inaccurate, but stopped short of saying
no payment was made. And Tor has responded
by saying that these vague responses raise a whole host of questions on
their own.
The public saga leading up to the recent accusations began in July 2014,
when Ed Felten, the then-director of Princeton’s Center for Information
Technology Policy, noted
that CERT/CC researchers at CMU had submitted a presentation abstract to
organizers of the Black Hat security conference discussing a new
vulnerability they had found in Tor. The timing of CERT/CC’s pitch to
Black Hat aligned with a large-scale attack on Tor that lasted from
January to July 2014, during which CERT/CC researchers shared only
“hints” about the vulnerability they had discovered. As for the
abstract, it was abruptly withdrawn in July when CMU failed to approve
the content of the talk for public release.
Eyebrows were again raised in January 2015, after the arrest
of a man who allegedly helped run Silk Road 2.0, a large online trading
post on the dark web whose visitors often use Tor to access the site. At
the time, some speculated that his arrest was tied to the attack against
Tor in the first half of 2014.
Most recently, in mid-November, Tor accused CMU of accepting payment and
assisting the FBI — in ways that indicate a warrant was not involved —
to “attack hidden services users in a broad sweep, and then sift through
their data to find people.” These allegations are hugely problematic for
CERT/CC. As an entity that espouses  to be
“a trusted, authoritative organization dedicated to improving the
security of computer systems and networks,” finding and not disclosing
vulnerabilities is a good way to undermine that trust. Exploiting those
vulnerabilities is even worse.
But let’s take a step back for a moment. Why, beyond the obvious privacy
concerns raised by Tor, is this such a big deal?
CERT/CC, and indeed the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)
community as a whole
is a pillar of global cybersecurity. (CSIRT is another term often used
to describe the type of organization CERT/CC is.) Generally, CSIRTs are
responsible for receiving, reviewing, and responding to computer
security incident reports from a set of clients, which can include
government agencies, private companies, security researchers, and
ordinary Internet users.
Since the late 1980s, CERT/CC, as the name suggests, has been a major
coordination center for global CSIRT activities. As as result, it has
access to a wide array of incident information and vulnerabilities,
which could, hypothetically, be used to help crack Tor’s anonymity
feature. In addition, the organization — initially funded as a DARPA
project and still funded  with federal money —
is largely transnational in nature and serves as the secretariat for
national CSIRTs, more than 100 of which are distributed across the globe.
CSIRTs are increasingly referenced in international discussions as a key
component in efforts to build global capacity to combat cybersecurity
threats and develop norms of behavior among nations in the cyber realm.
For example, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on
cybersecurity suggested
 this summer
that special teams authorized to respond to cybersecurity incidents,
such as CSIRTs, should not be used to “engage in malicious international
activity” and should not be the target of attacks. If CSIRTs are to be
held out as off limits, they need to be impartial (like, say, the Red
Cross ) and cannot be
political actors, lest they become legitimate targets.
CERT/CC, and many other CSIRTs around the world, collect information
that can be very useful for both identifying and capturing criminals.
They rely heavily
on the trust incident reporters and vulnerability researchers have in
the CSIRTs, trust that is garnered after developing close ties with the
constituencies they serve. When a CSIRT is discovered, or even rumored,
to be acting in a way that is negligent or undermines network security
of perfectly legal services, this bond of trust is fractured. Less trust
means less information for CSIRTs.
To pour salt on the wound, the controversy around the latest story
undermines the effectiveness of CERT/CC both to carry out its own duties
and to assist the FBI in the future. Though it is often not explicit in
documentation, a relationship between CSIRTs and law enforcement
agencies is often assumed. Indeed, such cooperation can be helpful for
both law enforcement and CSIRTs. Law enforcement can obtain important
technical information about incidents from CSIRTs, which in turn helps
law enforcement identify and pursue cyber-criminals. On the flipside,
some industries (particularly in the US) have close relationships with
law enforcement that result in law enforcement becoming an important
reporter of incidents to the CSIRT. But if these two types of bodies are
to have close working relationships, they should follow explicit and
transparent guidelines in accordance with due process. If the FBI is
engaging with CSIRTs to essentially break a feature of Internet security
en masse, it is making its own life more difficult down the line by
removing the legitimacy of a key ally in cyber criminal investigations.
To be clear: This is not an indictment of CSIRTs working with law
enforcement. As I explain in detail with my colleagues Isabel Skierka,
Mirko Hohmann, and Tim Maurer in our recent report
cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement is not necessarily a bad
thing. A comprehensive approach to addressing cybercrime would ideally
meld the technical expertise and access CSIRTs have painstakingly
developed with traditional law enforcement expertise found in agencies
like the FBI. In fact, many national-level CSIRTs actually sit within
law enforcement, intelligence, or national security organizations or
have formal liaisons with those agencies.
Indeed, most in the CSIRT community seem ready to accept that CSIRTs
have reached a point in their maturity where a formal, transparent
relationship with law enforcement is practicable. This is because the
quandary facing CSIRTs is one that has pervaded the American
intelligence community for decades: Some activities simply do not pass
the front-page test; meaning that some actions, when they come to light,
will hurt the reputation of the organization. As New America
Cybersecurity Fellow and Georgia Tech professor Peter Swire wrote
earlier this year
the half-life of secrets is diminishing, and interactions like CERT/CC’s
with the FBI are likely to become known much sooner than they would in
the past. For the CSIRT community, which relies so heavily on trust for
effectiveness, keeping their relationships with the government secret
will be both extremely difficult and may undermine their reputations
once they come to light.
The news of CMU’s possible assistance in compromising Tor’s most
critical feature, anonymity, presents an opportunity for many to attack
the integrity of CERT/CC and the researchers at the Software Engineering
Institute. Bruce Schneier
and others
have been quick to point out that this incident has erased (or at least
greatly diminished) CERT/CC’s hard-earned reputation as an honest
broker. It is certain to be a warning to other CSIRTs around the world
that they should transparently define their relationships with law
enforcement agencies.
Regardless of how fault should be apportioned in this particular
instance, the news comes as part of a larger trend in the CSIRT
community. Once relatively apolitical, these technical teams are
undergoing a process of politicization. National level CSIRTs, many of
which once resided outside of government in academic institutions and
non-governmental organizations, are being pulled into government
structures. At the same time, their relationships with law enforcement
agencies are becoming closer and (to those outside of the agencies) more
What can be done to protect the credibility and neutrality of these
important pillars in the network security ecosystem? The recommendations
we outline in our report provide a roadmap:
  * The first step to protect trust in these teams is to reverse the
    recent trend and /not/ place them under the control of law
    enforcement and intelligence agencies. Such agencies are
    incentivized to use the tools at their disposal to investigate
    crime, collect intelligence, and pursue threat groups, and thus will
    often disregard the apolitical information coordination role CSIRTs
    play.
  * Second, CSIRTs and law enforcement must more transparently define
    the terms of their cooperation, including how and under what
    circumstances they interact. They should also clearly define what
    kinds of information and expertise are exchanged and what
    direction(s) shared information flows.
  * Third, for CSIRTs to remain trusted brokers, they must clarify their
    mandates and missions. Traditionally, a CSIRT has placed remediating
    damage from incidents and returning systems to operation as top
    priorities. Is this still the case, or is CSIRT expertise being
    poured into combating cybercrime and assisting law enforcement
    agencies in developing tools and methods to discover criminals?
Finally, though not included in our recommendations in the report, to
recover the trust it has recently lost, CERT/CC’s mission and role needs
to be clearly defined by the organization itself, its funders, its
partners, and its constituency. Is it essentially a second US national
CSIRT alongside the Department of Homeland Security’s US-CERT
, or is it something closer to a private CSIRT
that plays a role in maintaining global cybersecurity? If it is a
global, non-government CSIRT, transparently defining its relationship
with law enforcement, intelligence, and other political actors — both
inside and outside the US — is all the more important.
In the end, the actions of the computer security professionals at
CERT/CC who allegedly aided the FBI are somewhat understandable. Their
overarching goal is to secure computer systems. The traditional CSIRT
approach focuses on technical identification and remediation of
incidents, in addition to promoting technical measures to protect
systems from attacks in the first place. The goal of law enforcement
bodies in cybersecurity is to lend a helping hand in preventing attacks
from taking place by rounding up the likely and past perpetrators. That
aligns with the CSIRT community’s goal. But the allegations of the
researchers’ work (the cybersecurity applicability of which is dubious
at best) to crack Tor demonstrate the damage that can be done when when
a CSIRT’s interaction with law enforcement is not openly and strictly
The controversy surrounding this story represents something much larger
than the alleged incident. CSIRTs are meant to be apolitical actors
concentrating on computer and network security. The ramifications of
politicization and muddied mandates could permeate up to states’ efforts
to develop international norms of behavior in cyberspace, like those
by the UN Group of Governmental Experts, that rely on the integrity and
independence of global CSIRTs. By undermining these norms before they
take root, the FBI, and by extension the US government, undermine their
own efforts to promote an open and secure cyberspace through norms for
responsible state behavior.

One of the things my dad bequeathed me was an Omega "Moon Watch"... at
least that's the way Omega advertised them. What was unique about the
one I had vs the advertised store variety was the fact that it was an
old fashioned wind-up, as opposed to the retail version, a self-winder.
Why the difference? As my dad put it "We didn't know if a self-winder
would work in zero-gravity", and they weren't willing to take the risk.
If the moon landing was a hoax, it was such an intricate one it would
have cost more to execute then actually landing someone on the moon.

I wonder who could be doing this...
*Turkish Internet hit with massive DDoS attack*
By Efe Kerem Sozeri
Turkey  is under massive cyberattack. Since Monday morning, the country's official domain name servers have
been under a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack
. The
attack’s perpetrators are unknown, but it reveals the vulnerabilities of
the country’s Internet infrastructure.
All domain names that end with Turkey’s two-letter country code .tr
 must be registered by NIC.tr
an administration office in Turkey’s capital of Ankara. Besides its
registration duties, NIC.tr maintains the academic internet backbone for
Turkish universities. It’s also the main service for .tr domain names,
making it a valuable target.
On Monday morning Turkish time, traces of an attack became noticeable.
By noon, NIC.tr’s five nameservers, ns1.nic.tr through ns5.nic.tr,
werecompletely down under a 40 Gigabits per second DDoS  attack.
    . at adililhan  Two of the routes
    hosting nic.tr experienced instability yesterday
    pic.twitter.com/OHk3dF0Bxo     — Dyn Research ( December 15, 2015
Europe’s regional Internet registry, the RIPE Network Coordination
Centre, serves as a secondary Domain Name System to Nic.tr. RIPE was
also severely affected
As noted
 by its
manager of the Global Information Infrastructure, Romero Zwart, the
attack was “modified to evade” RIPE's mitigation measures. As of this
writing, the attack is still going on at around 40 Gbps, disrupting
working hours
in Turkey.
DDoS attacks, which overload servers with requests for information, are
a simple way of disrupting a website for a brief amount of time. The
cost of hiring attacking
 botnets
, huge armies of compromised computers
that can all visit a site at the same time, is getting cheaper, and the
size of attacks is growing each year
. In
2013, an average DDoS attack was about 2 Gbps. In 2014, it’s nearly 8 Gbps.
While a 40 Gbps attack still sounds huge, security experts
say that even 400 Gbps attacks, like one recently reported
by DDoS mitigation service Cloudflare, are “the new normal.”
What makes the Turkish attack so damaging is the attackers’
sophisticated choice of target. By focusing on a relatively small group
of IP addresses, the five nameservers of NIC.tr, the attackers managed
to “take down the DNS system of a whole country with a 40 Gbps attack:”
      40GBitlik saldirida butun bir
    ulkenin alan adlari sisteminin cokmesi kabul edilemez               — Mehmet Akcin ( December 15, 2015
As the country’s official domain suffix, .tr domain names are very
popular in Turkey, and many local companies want their businesses
officially recognized for their local audience. There are about 400,000
websites  with
localized Turkish domain names, including 300,000 companies. It's also
used by government institutions, schools, municipalities, Turkish e-mail
servers , and the Turkish
When the attack left NIC.tr’s DNS service non-responding, practically
all .tr domain names became unreachable. Besides the private Turkish
companies, official government businesses such as vital population
registry queries, remained interrupted for more than a day. Internet
access at university campuses are still down or extremely slow.
On Monday evening, Turkey’sNational Response Center for Cyber Events
 closed all incoming traffic to NIC.tr from
outside of Turkey, which made 400,000 websites with .tr domain names
unreachable from the rest of the world, all e-mails sent to companies
and organisations with .tr domains bounced back with the “unknown host”
Response Center changed its policy late Monday night, and NIC.tr has
since been running a selective block policy for a number of suspected
root IP addresses. DNS service for .tr domains were also re-configured
 to
distribute the queries among public and private servers, including a
Turkish Internet service providers Superonline and Vodafone.
It’s notoriously difficult to attribute where a cyberattack comes from.
Many Turkish commentators have pointed to Russia
 as the source of the attack. Russia’s
cyber warfare capabilities
are an established weapon, believed to be used against Estonia in 2007
, Georgia in
and Ukraine in 2014
With Turkey’s recent downing of a Russian jet
 near Syrian border,
and with the ongoingtroll wars
between Erdoğan’s and Putin’s social media campaigners, DDoS botnets
could be the next battleground. Some experts have speculated this is a
response to Turkey’s nationalist cyber teams, who stand accused of
organising aDDoS attack on Russia’s Sputnik news
    It's highly probable that ddos attacks on nic.tr and tr ISPs are
    retaliation to recent      ddos attacks
    — Umut Simsek ( December 15, 2015
DDoS attacks are by nature distributed, therefore the identity of the
attackers could never be found out; but the consequences identified the
vulnerabilities of the target very well.

On January 8 2016 the US Supreme Court will consider a petition for
certiorari in the EPIC v. DHS "Standard Operating Procedure 303" FOIA
suit. SOP 303 is also known as the 'National Emergency Wireless Kill-Switch'
“Standard Operating Procedure 303,” is the protocol that codifies a
“shutdown and restoration process for use by commercial and private
wireless networks during national crisis.”
Moreover, the justices are expected to clarify: “the scope of FOIA’s
“Exemption 7(F),” which allows the government to withhold “records or
information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the
extent that the production of such law enforcement records or
information … could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or
physical safety of any individual.”
    The central question raised by Exemption 7(F) is whether the
government has to be able to identify with any specificity the
“individual” whose life or physical safety might be endangered by
disclosure of the requested law enforcement records. In 2008, the Second
Circuit answered that question in the affirmative in ACLU v. Dep’t of
Defense. In its February 2015 decision affirming the government’s
rejection of EPIC’s FOIA request, the D.C. Circuit held expressly to the
contrary. As I explain in the post that follows, not only is this
division of authority sufficiently important so as to justify the
Supreme Court’s intervention no matter how the Court ultimately rules,
but, in my view, the Second Circuit clearly has the better reading of
Exemption 7(F) as a matter of statutory purpose, structure, and policy.
    I.  The Second Circuit and the PNSDA
    The story begins with FOIA requests filed in 2003 by the ACLU and
other organizations seeking records related to the treatment and death
of detainees held in US custody overseas after September 11, and records
related to the practice of “rendering” some of those detainees to
countries known to use torture. The litigation over the ACLU’s request
eventually reduced to a dispute over at least 29 (and perhaps thousands
of) photographs of detainees and detainee abuse in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In June 2006, the district court ordered the release of 21 of those
photographs (with proper redactions to alleviate privacy objections),
and the government appealed, arguing that the photographs were covered
by Exemption 7(F) insofar as their release would likely incite violence
against US personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq.”

for the economy of my town than having someone who lives in a unit year
round, goes shopping for groceries every week, has his car work done at

@_subject: The FBI, Carnegie-Mellon University, CERT/CC, and Tor 
From Just Security (legal):
Reports surfaced last month suggesting that Carnegie Mellon University
(CMU) has been helping
the FBI crack Tor, the secure browsing application used by
privacy-conscious Internet users for both legal and illegal activities.
Normally, an academic institution assisting law enforcement in fighting
crime wouldn’t raise any eyebrows, particularly if that assistance came
in the form of responding to subpoenas. But this isn’t your average
case. Beyond the complicated (and unclear) set of facts involved, CMU
houses the Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center
(CERT/CC), one of the world’s most important hubs for coordinating
information about various cybersecurity vulnerabilities and attacks.
More than a month after the news first broke, the details are murky at
best. Tor has alleged
that the FBI paid CMU to crack the system’s anonymity feature in
exchange for payment. CMU’s own statement
about the incident says that many of the media reports have been
inaccurate, but acknowledges that the university — and by extension
CERT/CC — complies with valid subpoenas that it receives (as it must).
It also said that it receives “no funding for compliance.” The FBI has
that reports on the payment are inaccurate, but stopped short of saying
no payment was made. And Tor has responded
by saying that these vague responses raise a whole host of questions on
their own.
The public saga leading up to the recent accusations began in July 2014,
when Ed Felten, the then-director of Princeton’s Center for Information
Technology Policy, noted
that CERT/CC researchers at CMU had submitted a presentation abstract to
organizers of the Black Hat security conference discussing a new
vulnerability they had found in Tor. The timing of CERT/CC’s pitch to
Black Hat aligned with a large-scale attack on Tor that lasted from
January to July 2014, during which CERT/CC researchers shared only
“hints” about the vulnerability they had discovered. As for the
abstract, it was abruptly withdrawn in July when CMU failed to approve
the content of the talk for public release.
Eyebrows were again raised in January 2015, after the arrest
of a man who allegedly helped run Silk Road 2.0, a large online trading
post on the dark web whose visitors often use Tor to access the site. At
the time, some speculated that his arrest was tied to the attack against
Tor in the first half of 2014.
Most recently, in mid-November, Tor accused CMU of accepting payment and
assisting the FBI — in ways that indicate a warrant was not involved —
to “attack hidden services users in a broad sweep, and then sift through
their data to find people.” These allegations are hugely problematic for
CERT/CC. As an entity that espouses  to be
“a trusted, authoritative organization dedicated to improving the
security of computer systems and networks,” finding and not disclosing
vulnerabilities is a good way to undermine that trust. Exploiting those
vulnerabilities is even worse.
But let’s take a step back for a moment. Why, beyond the obvious privacy
concerns raised by Tor, is this such a big deal?
CERT/CC, and indeed the Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT)
community as a whole
is a pillar of global cybersecurity. (CSIRT is another term often used
to describe the type of organization CERT/CC is.) Generally, CSIRTs are
responsible for receiving, reviewing, and responding to computer
security incident reports from a set of clients, which can include
government agencies, private companies, security researchers, and
ordinary Internet users.
Since the late 1980s, CERT/CC, as the name suggests, has been a major
coordination center for global CSIRT activities. As as result, it has
access to a wide array of incident information and vulnerabilities,
which could, hypothetically, be used to help crack Tor’s anonymity
feature. In addition, the organization — initially funded as a DARPA
project and still funded  with federal money —
is largely transnational in nature and serves as the secretariat for
national CSIRTs, more than 100 of which are distributed across the globe.
CSIRTs are increasingly referenced in international discussions as a key
component in efforts to build global capacity to combat cybersecurity
threats and develop norms of behavior among nations in the cyber realm.
For example, the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts on
cybersecurity suggested
 this summer
that special teams authorized to respond to cybersecurity incidents,
such as CSIRTs, should not be used to “engage in malicious international
activity” and should not be the target of attacks. If CSIRTs are to be
held out as off limits, they need to be impartial (like, say, the Red
Cross ) and cannot be
political actors, lest they become legitimate targets.
CERT/CC, and many other CSIRTs around the world, collect information
that can be very useful for both identifying and capturing criminals.
They rely heavily
on the trust incident reporters and vulnerability researchers have in
the CSIRTs, trust that is garnered after developing close ties with the
constituencies they serve. When a CSIRT is discovered, or even rumored,
to be acting in a way that is negligent or undermines network security
of perfectly legal services, this bond of trust is fractured. Less trust
means less information for CSIRTs.
To pour salt on the wound, the controversy around the latest story
undermines the effectiveness of CERT/CC both to carry out its own duties
and to assist the FBI in the future. Though it is often not explicit in
documentation, a relationship between CSIRTs and law enforcement
agencies is often assumed. Indeed, such cooperation can be helpful for
both law enforcement and CSIRTs. Law enforcement can obtain important
technical information about incidents from CSIRTs, which in turn helps
law enforcement identify and pursue cyber-criminals. On the flipside,
some industries (particularly in the US) have close relationships with
law enforcement that result in law enforcement becoming an important
reporter of incidents to the CSIRT. But if these two types of bodies are
to have close working relationships, they should follow explicit and
transparent guidelines in accordance with due process. If the FBI is
engaging with CSIRTs to essentially break a feature of Internet security
en masse, it is making its own life more difficult down the line by
removing the legitimacy of a key ally in cyber criminal investigations.
To be clear: This is not an indictment of CSIRTs working with law
enforcement. As I explain in detail with my colleagues Isabel Skierka,
Mirko Hohmann, and Tim Maurer in our recent report
cooperation between CSIRTs and law enforcement is not necessarily a bad
thing. A comprehensive approach to addressing cybercrime would ideally
meld the technical expertise and access CSIRTs have painstakingly
developed with traditional law enforcement expertise found in agencies
like the FBI. In fact, many national-level CSIRTs actually sit within
law enforcement, intelligence, or national security organizations or
have formal liaisons with those agencies.
Indeed, most in the CSIRT community seem ready to accept that CSIRTs
have reached a point in their maturity where a formal, transparent
relationship with law enforcement is practicable. This is because the
quandary facing CSIRTs is one that has pervaded the American
intelligence community for decades: Some activities simply do not pass
the front-page test; meaning that some actions, when they come to light,
will hurt the reputation of the organization. As New America
Cybersecurity Fellow and Georgia Tech professor Peter Swire wrote
earlier this year
the half-life of secrets is diminishing, and interactions like CERT/CC’s
with the FBI are likely to become known much sooner than they would in
the past. For the CSIRT community, which relies so heavily on trust for
effectiveness, keeping their relationships with the government secret
will be both extremely difficult and may undermine their reputations
once they come to light.
The news of CMU’s possible assistance in compromising Tor’s most
critical feature, anonymity, presents an opportunity for many to attack
the integrity of CERT/CC and the researchers at the Software Engineering
Institute. Bruce Schneier
and others
have been quick to point out that this incident has erased (or at least
greatly diminished) CERT/CC’s hard-earned reputation as an honest
broker. It is certain to be a warning to other CSIRTs around the world
that they should transparently define their relationships with law
enforcement agencies.
Regardless of how fault should be apportioned in this particular
instance, the news comes as part of a larger trend in the CSIRT
community. Once relatively apolitical, these technical teams are
undergoing a process of politicization. National level CSIRTs, many of
which once resided outside of government in academic institutions and
non-governmental organizations, are being pulled into government
structures. At the same time, their relationships with law enforcement
agencies are becoming closer and (to those outside of the agencies) more
What can be done to protect the credibility and neutrality of these
important pillars in the network security ecosystem? The recommendations
we outline in our report provide a roadmap:
  * The first step to protect trust in these teams is to reverse the
    recent trend and /not/ place them under the control of law
    enforcement and intelligence agencies. Such agencies are
    incentivized to use the tools at their disposal to investigate
    crime, collect intelligence, and pursue threat groups, and thus will
    often disregard the apolitical information coordination role CSIRTs
    play.
  * Second, CSIRTs and law enforcement must more transparently define
    the terms of their cooperation, including how and under what
    circumstances they interact. They should also clearly define what
    kinds of information and expertise are exchanged and what
    direction(s) shared information flows.
  * Third, for CSIRTs to remain trusted brokers, they must clarify their
    mandates and missions. Traditionally, a CSIRT has placed remediating
    damage from incidents and returning systems to operation as top
    priorities. Is this still the case, or is CSIRT expertise being
    poured into combating cybercrime and assisting law enforcement
    agencies in developing tools and methods to discover criminals?
Finally, though not included in our recommendations in the report, to
recover the trust it has recently lost, CERT/CC’s mission and role needs
to be clearly defined by the organization itself, its funders, its
partners, and its constituency. Is it essentially a second US national
CSIRT alongside the Department of Homeland Security’s US-CERT
, or is it something closer to a private CSIRT
that plays a role in maintaining global cybersecurity? If it is a
global, non-government CSIRT, transparently defining its relationship
with law enforcement, intelligence, and other political actors — both
inside and outside the US — is all the more important.
In the end, the actions of the computer security professionals at
CERT/CC who allegedly aided the FBI are somewhat understandable. Their
overarching goal is to secure computer systems. The traditional CSIRT
approach focuses on technical identification and remediation of
incidents, in addition to promoting technical measures to protect
systems from attacks in the first place. The goal of law enforcement
bodies in cybersecurity is to lend a helping hand in preventing attacks
from taking place by rounding up the likely and past perpetrators. That
aligns with the CSIRT community’s goal. But the allegations of the
researchers’ work (the cybersecurity applicability of which is dubious
at best) to crack Tor demonstrate the damage that can be done when when
a CSIRT’s interaction with law enforcement is not openly and strictly
The controversy surrounding this story represents something much larger
than the alleged incident. CSIRTs are meant to be apolitical actors
concentrating on computer and network security. The ramifications of
politicization and muddied mandates could permeate up to states’ efforts
to develop international norms of behavior in cyberspace, like those
by the UN Group of Governmental Experts, that rely on the integrity and
independence of global CSIRTs. By undermining these norms before they
take root, the FBI, and by extension the US government, undermine their
own efforts to promote an open and secure cyberspace through norms for
responsible state behavior.

I wonder who could be doing this...
*Turkish Internet hit with massive DDoS attack*
By Efe Kerem Sozeri
Turkey  is under massive cyberattack. Since Monday morning, the country's official domain name servers have
been under a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack
. The
attack’s perpetrators are unknown, but it reveals the vulnerabilities of
the country’s Internet infrastructure.
All domain names that end with Turkey’s two-letter country code .tr
 must be registered by NIC.tr
an administration office in Turkey’s capital of Ankara. Besides its
registration duties, NIC.tr maintains the academic internet backbone for
Turkish universities. It’s also the main service for .tr domain names,
making it a valuable target.
On Monday morning Turkish time, traces of an attack became noticeable.
By noon, NIC.tr’s five nameservers, ns1.nic.tr through ns5.nic.tr,
werecompletely down under a 40 Gigabits per second DDoS  attack.
    . at adililhan  Two of the routes
    hosting nic.tr experienced instability yesterday
    pic.twitter.com/OHk3dF0Bxo     — Dyn Research ( December 15, 2015
Europe’s regional Internet registry, the RIPE Network Coordination
Centre, serves as a secondary Domain Name System to Nic.tr. RIPE was
also severely affected
As noted
 by its
manager of the Global Information Infrastructure, Romero Zwart, the
attack was “modified to evade” RIPE's mitigation measures. As of this
writing, the attack is still going on at around 40 Gbps, disrupting
working hours
in Turkey.
DDoS attacks, which overload servers with requests for information, are
a simple way of disrupting a website for a brief amount of time. The
cost of hiring attacking
 botnets
, huge armies of compromised computers
that can all visit a site at the same time, is getting cheaper, and the
size of attacks is growing each year
. In
2013, an average DDoS attack was about 2 Gbps. In 2014, it’s nearly 8 Gbps.
While a 40 Gbps attack still sounds huge, security experts
say that even 400 Gbps attacks, like one recently reported
by DDoS mitigation service Cloudflare, are “the new normal.”
What makes the Turkish attack so damaging is the attackers’
sophisticated choice of target. By focusing on a relatively small group
of IP addresses, the five nameservers of NIC.tr, the attackers managed
to “take down the DNS system of a whole country with a 40 Gbps attack:”

    ulkenin alan adlari sisteminin cokmesi kabul edilemez               — Mehmet Akcin ( December 15, 2015
As the country’s official domain suffix, .tr domain names are very
popular in Turkey, and many local companies want their businesses
officially recognized for their local audience. There are about 400,000
websites  with
localized Turkish domain names, including 300,000 companies. It's also
used by government institutions, schools, municipalities, Turkish e-mail
servers , and the Turkish
When the attack left NIC.tr’s DNS service non-responding, practically
all .tr domain names became unreachable. Besides the private Turkish
companies, official government businesses such as vital population
registry queries, remained interrupted for more than a day. Internet
access at university campuses are still down or extremely slow.
On Monday evening, Turkey’sNational Response Center for Cyber Events
 closed all incoming traffic to NIC.tr from
outside of Turkey, which made 400,000 websites with .tr domain names
unreachable from the rest of the world, all e-mails sent to companies
and organisations with .tr domains bounced back with the “unknown host”
Response Center changed its policy late Monday night, and NIC.tr has
since been running a selective block policy for a number of suspected
root IP addresses. DNS service for .tr domains were also re-configured
 to
distribute the queries among public and private servers, including a
Turkish Internet service providers Superonline and Vodafone.
It’s notoriously difficult to attribute where a cyberattack comes from.
Many Turkish commentators have pointed to Russia
 as the source of the attack. Russia’s
cyber warfare capabilities
are an established weapon, believed to be used against Estonia in 2007
, Georgia in
and Ukraine in 2014
With Turkey’s recent downing of a Russian jet
 near Syrian border,
and with the ongoingtroll wars
between Erdoğan’s and Putin’s social media campaigners, DDoS botnets
could be the next battleground. Some experts have speculated this is a
response to Turkey’s nationalist cyber teams, who stand accused of
organising aDDoS attack on Russia’s Sputnik news
    It's highly probable that ddos attacks on nic.tr and tr ISPs are
    retaliation to recent      ddos attacks
    — Umut Simsek ( December 15, 2015
DDoS attacks are by nature distributed, therefore the identity of the
attackers could never be found out; but the consequences identified the
vulnerabilities of the target very well.

On January 8 2016 the US Supreme Court will consider a petition for
certiorari in the EPIC v. DHS "Standard Operating Procedure 303" FOIA
suit. SOP 303 is also known as the 'National Emergency Wireless Kill-Switch'
“Standard Operating Procedure 303,” is the protocol that codifies a
“shutdown and restoration process for use by commercial and private
wireless networks during national crisis.”
Moreover, the justices are expected to clarify: “the scope of FOIA’s
“Exemption 7(F),” which allows the government to withhold “records or
information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the
extent that the production of such law enforcement records or
information … could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or
physical safety of any individual.”
    The central question raised by Exemption 7(F) is whether the
government has to be able to identify with any specificity the
“individual” whose life or physical safety might be endangered by
disclosure of the requested law enforcement records. In 2008, the Second
Circuit answered that question in the affirmative in ACLU v. Dep’t of
Defense. In its February 2015 decision affirming the government’s
rejection of EPIC’s FOIA request, the D.C. Circuit held expressly to the
contrary. As I explain in the post that follows, not only is this
division of authority sufficiently important so as to justify the
Supreme Court’s intervention no matter how the Court ultimately rules,
but, in my view, the Second Circuit clearly has the better reading of
Exemption 7(F) as a matter of statutory purpose, structure, and policy.
    I.  The Second Circuit and the PNSDA
    The story begins with FOIA requests filed in 2003 by the ACLU and
other organizations seeking records related to the treatment and death
of detainees held in US custody overseas after September 11, and records
related to the practice of “rendering” some of those detainees to
countries known to use torture. The litigation over the ACLU’s request
eventually reduced to a dispute over at least 29 (and perhaps thousands
of) photographs of detainees and detainee abuse in Afghanistan and Iraq.
In June 2006, the district court ordered the release of 21 of those
photographs (with proper redactions to alleviate privacy objections),
and the government appealed, arguing that the photographs were covered
by Exemption 7(F) insofar as their release would likely incite violence
against US personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq.”

Hello all,
The Tor Project aims to guarantee privacy and open communications
online.Â  Their signature product is the Tor Browser.
Please share this announcement widely.
The Situation
The Tor Project, one of the worldâs strongest advocates for privacy and
anonymous, open communications is currently seeking an experienced
Executive Director to take the helm. The new Executive Director will
spearhead key initiatives to make the organization even more robust in
its fight to advance human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying
anonymity and privacy technologies, advancing their scientific and
popular understanding, and encouraging their use.
The Position
The position provides the high-profile opportunity to assume the voice
and face of Tor to the world, and particularly to the global community
of Internet organizations dedicated to maintaining a stable, secure and

Reply-To: 	liberationtech Newsgroups: 	gmane.technology.liberationtech
Hello LiberationTech subscribers,
SeeOnce is a new web app that encrypts text and files with forward
secrecy. This is achieved by changing keys with every message rather
than using a server to store keys or encrypted material. SeeOnce
consists of a single, relatively small html document, which doesn't
connect to any servers. It is based on a javascript implementation of
TweetNaCl, plus WiseHash, a dictionary-based key entropy meter that adds
a variable number of scrypt key stretching rounds for weaker keys.
Forward secrecy is obtained through a protocol similar to OTR messaging,
except that communications are expected to be asynchronous. SeeOnce
connects to the browser's default email through conventional mailto and
web links, so users don't need to install anything. Removal of ephemeral
data can be done via a single button.
Another important goal is to make key exchange transparent to the user,
so that even complete novices can use it right away.
Please take a look at SeeOnce and give us any suggestions you might
think appropriate. The preferred way is by starting Issues at the
project's GitHub page at:
The app is directly downloadable from  A Chrome app,

I want to beg the point here. One of the guidelines of American society
was implicit, institutionalized racism, and many people were punished in
myriad ways for trying to change that. Some ended up dead.
When I was a chld back in elementary school (vamping on Jim Morrison
vamping on Lord Buckley), knee bends were a common gym exercise. Now
they're known to cause knee damage and no longer practiced as part of a
current school gym fitness program.
Being able to swim meant you were a witch.
Should I continue listing examples?
I'd rather rant.
Society punishes people alright, but that doesn't make that society's
judgment correct, moral or ethical.
I'd say the same for punishment of children for not performing to their
parent's expectations assuming the child was not in any physical danger,
and parents in American society often think the most harmless things are
dangerous... Because they simply 'don't get out very much'.
Wear a beard in my town full of clean-shaven upwardly mobile yuppies and
dinks and they shy away from you like you're Charlie Manson incarnate.
But simply go bald-faced, and no one thinks your strange at all until
they find out after-the-fact you're going out to fern bars picking up
women in your Izod Dockers and rollie costume for the purpose of raping
Most industrial society parents are literally vicious morons and they
should NOT be allowed to punish children for not conforming. Native
Americans didn't, and in my child-rearing years I didn't, and you know,

"DO NOT call it 'Predictive Policing'!"
He obviously didn't believe it was a correct phrase to describe "Guessing".
Ps. The use of computers to resolve cold-cases mentioned below isn't
really relevant to the topic of computers allegedly predicting future

opportunities for more convincing false flag operations by people
affiliated with (but perhaps not directly connected to) police agencies.

I want to beg the point here. One of the guidelines of American society
was implicit, institutionalized racism, and many people were punished in
myriad ways for trying to change that. Some ended up dead.
When I was a chld back in elementary school (vamping on Jim Morrison
vamping on Lord Buckley), knee bends were a common gym exercise. Now
they're known to cause knee damage and no longer practiced as part of a
current school gym fitness program.
Being able to swim meant you were a witch.
Should I continue listing examples?
I'd rather rant.
Society punishes people alright, but that doesn't make that society's
judgment correct, moral or ethical.
I'd say the same for punishment of children for not performing to their
parent's expectations assuming the child was not in any physical danger,
and parents in American society often think the most harmless things are
dangerous... Because they simply 'don't get out very much'.
Wear a beard in my town full of clean-shaven upwardly mobile yuppies and
dinks and they shy away from you like you're Charlie Manson incarnate.
But simply go bald-faced, and no one thinks your strange at all until
they find out after-the-fact you're going out to fern bars picking up
women in your Izod Dockers and rollie costume for the purpose of raping
Most industrial society parents are literally vicious morons and they
should NOT be allowed to punish children for not conforming. Native
Americans didn't, and in my child-rearing years I didn't, and you know,
my kids turned out just fine thanks.

Expecting criminals to adjudicate themselves as such is a little beyond

for the moment. The US subscribes to the UN charter and what passes for
international law, which to a huge extent the US had a guiding hand in
The UN allowed the United States leeway to literally invade Iraq based
on evidence presented known to be lies at the time they were told, by
almost everyone in the US government in a position to authorize policy,
diplomatic OR war-related, on Iraq
The US government and all of it's executives committed a criminal act
under international law by invading Iraq under false pretenses and
therefore IS an international criminal enterprise that continues to this
day in that country by our continued, and eternal (at least until the

The article contained the information that the column of cars was

he only knew...) for ROLLING (not smoking) a cigarette on a Starbucks
patio and was informed by the police it IS legal to take 'portrait

prevalent) that you can say anything you want short of threats of
violence and it IS NOT "assault".

Gladio, a NATO 'stay-behind' anti-communist army tasked with
destabilizing Italian (Belgian, other...) civil societies with various
kinds of acts including terrorism, designed to convince people in those
countries they'd be safer hanging with Western Industrial Capitalism

@_subject: Moon of Alabama: Context Of Yesterday's Turkish Attack Against The 
This article is copiously linked at Moon of Alabama
November 25, 2015
Was The U.S. Involved In The Turkish Attack Against The Russian Jet?
    Erdogan criticized Syria harshly on Tuesday for shooting down the
Turkish fighter jet, saying: "Even if the plane was in their airspace
for a few seconds, that is no excuse to attack."
    "It was clear that this plane was not an aggressive plane. Still it
was shot down," he said.Turkey hardens military position after Syria
downs jet June 27, 2012
    A violation of one to two kilometers is accepted as "natural" given
the speed of aircraft, the statement [by the the General Staff] said.
This year's violations of Turkish airspace lasted between 20 seconds and
nine minutes, which showed "airspace violations can be resolved by
warning and interceptions," the statement said.
    Turkey could have downed 114 planes for airspace violations: Army
June 25, 2012
    Turkish fighter jets and military helicopters have dramatically
increased their incursions into Greek airspace, according to a study
based on data from the Greek military, forcing the cash-strapped Greek
air force to respond.
    Turkey buzzes weakened Greece - In growing numbers Ankara’s fighter
jets test Greek territorial claims. - July 23, 2015
Turkey also regularly violates Iraq's airspace by flying bombing attacks
against Kurds in north Iraq.
All this provides that yesterday's incident in which Turkey shot down a
Russian jet was not a case of an ordinary airspace violation but a
deliberate act to take down a Russian plane. The surviving co-pilot of
the Russian jet insists that it neither flew through Turkish airspace
nor was warned of an imminent attack. As I wrote yesterday:
    This then was not legitimate air-defense but an ambush.
I am not the only one who came to that conclusion. Deep inside a
McClatchy piece a "western" diplomat sees it as an "orchestrated" event:
    One Western diplomat based in Iraq, but with extensive experience in
Syria and Turkey, called the incident “brazenly orchestrated and
inevitable,” but asked that the identification of his country not be
used in the statement.
The Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov also came to that conclusion:
    The downing of a Russian warplane in Syria by Turkey appears to be a
pre-planned provocation, the Russian Foreign Minister said. Ankara
failed to communicate with Russia over the incident, he added.
    “We have serious doubts that this act was unintentional. It looks
very much like a preplanned provocation,” Lavrov said, citing Turkey’s
failure to maintain proper communication with Russia, the abundance of
footage of the incident and other evidence.
Several NATO ambassadors will have had the same though when they
admonished Ankara over the act:
    "There are other ways of dealing with these kinds of incidents,"
said one diplomat who declined to be named.
The attack on the Russian plane was preconceived on November 22 when a
security summit was held with the Turkish government under Prime
Minister Davutoğlu and the Turkish Armed Forces. Davutoğlu personally
gave the order to shoot down Russian planes. This, Turkey says, was
necessary to stop Russian bombing of "Turkmen" in north Syria's Latakia
near the Turkish border.
Many of the "Syrian Turkmen" fighting against the Syrian people are from
Central Asia and part of the terrorist groups of Jabhat al-Nusra, Ansar
Al Shams, Jabhat Ansar Ad Din and Ahrar al Shams. Uighurs smuggled in
from China and fighting under the "Turkistan Islamist Party" label even
advertise their ‘little jihadists’ children training camps in the area.
The few real Syrian Turkmen work, as even the BBC admits, together with
al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Their leader and spokesman, one
Alparslan Celik, is a Turkish citizen from Elazığ.
The Turkish claim of defending "Turkmen" in Syria is a sham. It is
defending mostly foreign Islamist terrorists.
Whoever planned the ambush on the Russian jet miscalculated the
reaction. NATO will not come to Turkey's help over this or the next such
incident. NATO countries know that the Russian plane was hit within
Syria. Russia will not be scared into drawing back. Instead it massively
increased the bombing of targets in that area:
    At least 12 air strikes hit Latakia's northern countryside as
pro-government forces clashed with fighters from al Qaeda's Nusra Front
and Turkmen insurgents in the Jabal Akrad and Jabal Turkman areas, the
British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
    A Turkmen commander said missiles fired from Russian warships in the
Mediterranean were also hitting the area, as well as heavy artillery
Russian jets also bombed insurgency supply trucks (video) in al-Qaeda
controlled Azaz, north of Aleppo and just some two kilometers from the
Turkish border. They also bombed the Bab al-Hawa border crossing to
Turkey. That is a big FU to Erdogan.
The Russian missile cruiser Moskva with its extensive air defense
systems is now covering the area. Russia will officially deploy two
S-400 air defense systems to cover all of north-west Syria and southern
Turkey. Russia also has lots of electronic wizardry it can (and will)
apply. The preparation of additional airfields is ongoing. There will be
no outward military revenge against Turkey unless it crosses into Syria.
The "safe zone" within Syria Erdogan dreams of would have to be won by
defeating Russian forces.
The 4.5 million Russian tourists who visited Turkey this year will not
come again. Turkish business in Russia, mostly in the building industry
and agricultural products, will shrink to nearly zero. That the scheming
to take down a Russian air plane may have negative consequences for
Turkey suddenly also dawned to Davutoğlu who now pretends that we wants
to make nice again:
    Turkey is not aiming to escalate tension with Russia, Turkish Prime
Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu said Nov. 25, echoing President Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan following the downing of a SU-24 Russian jet the previous day.
    “Russia is our friend and neighbor. Our bilateral communication
channels are open. But our security, as for every friendly country,
should be based on the principle of respect under international law.
It’s normal to protect our national airspace,” Davutoğlu said,
addressing party members in parliament.
And it is normal for Russia to defend its ally Syria. Against all
enemies. By all means.
But back to Turkey's motive. The way this is played one might believe
that this was a indeed a lonely Turkish idea to defend its immediate
interests in Syria - the "Turkmen" as well as the oil business Erdogan's
son has with the Islamic State.
But there is also a bigger game going on and it is likely that Erdogan
has a new contract and Obama's backing for this escalation. James
Winnefeld, the deputy chief of General Staff of the U.S. military, was
in Ankara when the incident happened. The cooperation between U.S. and
Turkish military and especially the air forces is quite tight. It is
hard to believe that there was no communication about what was prepared
to happen.
After the Islamic State attack in France President Hollande attempted to
create a global coalition against IS which would include Russia and Iran
as well as the U.S. led anti-ISIS block. But such a coalition, which
makes a lot of sense, would have to agree to leave Syria alone and to
help Syrian ground forces to effectively fight the Islamic State. It
does not make sense to destroy the Syrian state and to just hope that
the outcome would be something better than an emboldened IS or AlQaeda
ruling in Damascus. That outcome is certainly not in Europe's interest.
But a global coalition is not in U.S. or Turkish interests. It would end
their common plans and efforts to overthrow the Syrian government and to
install a "Sunni" state in Syria and Iraq as a Turkish protectorate.
The Russian jet incident decreased the likelihood of such a coalition.
Holland, visiting Washington yesterday, had to pull back with his plan
and was again degraded to parrot Obama's "Assad must go" nonsense. Obama
feels emboldened and now pushes to widen the conflict in Syria:
    The Obama administration is using the current moment of extreme
anger and anxiety in Europe to press allies for sharp increases in their
contributions to the fight against the Islamic State. Suggestions
include more strike aircraft, more intelligence-sharing, more training
and equipment for local fighters, and deployment of their own special
operations ­forces.
    ...
    While new contributions would be added to anti-Islamic State
campaigns across the board, the attention is clearly on Syria, marking a
shift in what began as an “Iraq first” focus when Obama authorized
airstrikes in the region last fall.
    ...
    Obama, speaking beside Hollande on Tuesday, restated his insistence
that Assad is part of the problem, not the solution, and that he must go.
The Obama administration is also preparing to install the Turkish dream
of a "safe zone" between Aleppo and the Turkish border north of it.
    Among several coalition priorities in Syria, the United States has
begun a series of airstrikes in an area known as the “Mar’a line,” named
for a town north of Aleppo in the northwest. There, a 60-mile stretch to
the Euphrates River in the east is the only remaining part of the
Syria-Turkey border under Islamic State control.
    The administration had delayed beginning operations in the area
because U.S. aircraft were needed in operations farther east, and it has
been uncertain that local opposition forces­ would be able to hold the
territory if it could be cleared with airstrikes.
The increased Russian air defense and the likely increase of its
deployed planes will make those "safe zone" plans impossible.
But Obama, in my conclusion, still wants to drag NATO into Syria and
wants to assemble enough forces "against ISIS" to be able to overwhelm
the Syrian government and its Russian protectors. If that does not work
he at least hopes to give Russia the Afghanistan like "quagmire" in
Syria he and other U.S. officials promised. The again increasing
tensions with U.S. proxy Ukraine only help in that regard.
But there is even more to that plan. Just by chance (not) the NYT op-ed
pages launch a trial balloon today for the creation of a Sunni state in
east Syria and west Iraq. But that (Islamic) State is already there and
the "containment" strategy Obama practices towards it guarantees that it
will fester.
Obama continues his immensely destructive policies in the Middle East
with zero regard to the all the bad outcomes these are likely to have
for the people there as well as for Europe. One again wonders if all
these action follow from sheer incompetence or from some devilish,
ingenious strategic planning.

Thought I'd throw this out there...
The Archdruid Report
Druid perspectives on nature, culture, and the future of industrial society

The Shadows in the Cave
I had intended this week’s post to be the next episode in the Retrotopia
narrative, chronicling Peter Carr’s meeting with the irrepressible Col.
Tom Pappas of the Lakeland Republic Army, and the trip out to Defiance
County for the annual drone shoot, but that will have to wait another
week. No, I haven’t decided to comment instead on the recent spate of
terror attacks in France.  As people in a variety of other corners of
the world have pointed out, identical outrages happen all over the Third
World every few days.  The only reason this latest horror has gotten so
much air time is that it affected people in one of the world’s
privileged countries instead.
Nor am I going to be devoting this week’s post to the latest, extremely
troubling round of news from the climate change front—though that’s
going to get a post to itself down the road a bit, when I’ve had time to
do a little more research. That’s a far bigger story than the terror
attacks in Paris, though of course it’s not getting anything like as
much attention in the media.  From the beginning of serious salt water
infiltration into South Florida’s aquifers, through ominously bulging
sediments in Arctic Ocean shallows, to an assortment of truly
frightening data points from Greenland, it’s clear that we’ve passed the
threshold from “something may happen someday” to “something is happening
now”—a transition that probably has quite a bit to do with the
increasingly shrill tone of climate-change denialist rhetoric just now,
and even more to do with the increasingly plaintive tone of those
activists who still insist that everything can be fixed if we all just
join hands and sing “Kum ba ya” one more time.
No, this week’s post is going to explore a topic that’s far less
important in the overall scheme of things, though it’s not without its
relevance to the crisis of our age. I want to talk about the reaction I
fielded in response to last week’s post here on The Archdruid Report,
which was an exploration of our culture’s taboo against choosing not to
use the latest technologies.
I expected that post to field its share of outraged denunciations, and
it certainly did. What I didn’t expect was that it would receive more
comments than any other post in the history of The Archdruid Report, and
the vast majority of those comments would agree heartily with the two
points of that post. The first of these points is that there’s a
significant number of Americans out there who, for one good reason or
another, choose not to use cell phones, televisions, automobiles,
microwave ovens, and an assortment of other currently fashionable
technologies. The second is that there’s an even larger number of
Americans out there who get really, really freaky about people who make
such choices.
Some of the stories I heard from readers of my blog were absolute
classics of the type. There was the couple who don’t enjoy television
and so don’t own one, and had a relative ask them every single year,
over and over again, if she could buy them a television for Christmas. They said no thank you every single year, and finally she went out and
bought them a television anyway because she just couldn’t stand the
thought that they weren’t watching one. There was the coworker who
plopped a laptop playing some sitcom or other right down on the lap of
one of my readers and demanded that the reader watch it, right then and
there, so that they would have something to talk about. There was the
person who, offended by another reader’s lack of interest in television,
finally shouted, “You must be living in a dream world!” Er, which of
these people was spending four to six hours a day watching paid actors
playing imaginary characters act out fictional events in contrived settings?
Televisions were far from the only focus of this sort of technobullying.
Other readers reported getting similar reactions from other people
because they didn’t happen to have, and weren’t interested in having,
microwave ovens, smartphones, and so on down the list of currently
fashionable trinkets. The stories are really quite eye-opening, and not
in a good way. Forget about all the popular cant that insists that
you’re free in the USA to make your own choices and have whatever
lifestyle you want.  According to a significant fraction of
Americans—and to judge from what my readers reported, that fraction
isn’t limited to any one class, income level, or region of the
country—the only freedom you’re supposed to exercise, when it comes to
technology, is that of choosing which brand label will be slapped on
each item in the officially approved list of devices you’re expected to own.
The prevalence of technobullying and technoshaming in today’s America is
a fascinating point, and one we’ll explore in a few moments, with the
able assistance of the denunciations flung at last week’s post by the
minority of readers who reacted that way. What I want to consider first
is the fact that so many people responded to last week’s post so
positively. One blog in an uncrowded corner of the internet, written by
an author whose day job as an archdruid locates him squarely on the
outer fringes of contemporary American life, is very nearly the opposite
of a statistically valid poll. Still, the sheer volume of the response
makes me suspect that something significant is going on here.
By that I don’t mean that there’s some sort of groundswell of
renunciation, leading people to walk away from technologies in the same
spirit that led medieval ascetics to don hair shirts and flog themselves
for the good of their souls. That’s one of the common stereotypes
directed at those of us who aren’t interested in the latest technotrash,
and it completely misses what’s actually going on. I’ll use myself as an
example here. I don’t own a television—I haven’t owned one in my adult
life—and it’s not because I have some moral or political objection to
televisions, or because I’m into self-denial, or what have you. I don’t
own a television because I find watching television about as enticing as
eating a bowl of warm snot.
It’s not the programming, either—that’s another of the standard
stereotypes, that the only thing one can find objectionable about
television is the programming, and it’s as inaccurate as the rest.  To
me, quite simply, the activity of watching little colored shapes jerk
around on a screen is boring and irritating, not relaxing and enjoyable,
no matter what the little colored shapes are supposed to be doing. Yes,
I grew up with a television in the house.  I experienced plenty of it
back in the day, and I have zero interest in experiencing any more,
because I don’t like it. It really is that simple. It’s that simple for
others as well: they don’t find this or that technology enjoyable,
useful, or relevant to their lifestyles, and so they’ve chosen to do
something else with their money and time. Shouldn’t so simple and
personal a choice be their own business, and nobody else’s?
To judge by the reactions that those who make such choices routinely
field, apparently not. The pushbacks discussed in the comments page last
week range from the sort of in-your-face confrontations discussed above
to a much-forwarded article in I forget which online rag, where somebody
was airily announcing that he wasn’t interested in being friends with
somebody unless he could text some vacuous comment about lunch to the
other person at 2:15 and get a response by 2:30. (My readers and I are
good with that—somebody who insists on getting immediate feedback for
their random outbursts of mental flatulence isn’t somebody we want as a
friend, either.) Then there were the indignant responses to last week’s
post, which belong in a category by themselves.
I’m sorry to say that my favorite diatribe didn’t show up in the comment
queue for The Archdruid Report. It appeared instead on one of the many
other websites that carry my weekly posts, and it insisted, among
several other less juicy bits, that my lack of enthusiasm for television
obviously meant that I was conspiring to deprive everyone else of their
teevees. You’ve got to admit that for sheer giddy delirium, that one’s
hard to beat. By the same logic, if I dislike peanuts—as in fact I do—I
must be committed to some kind of anti-peanut crusade devoted to
eradicating the entire species. Not so;  Arachis hypogaea is welcome to
live and thrive, for all I care, and my fellow hominids are equally
welcome to eat as much of its produce as they happen to desire.  In
fact, they can divide my share among them. The only thing I ask in
return is that nobody expect me to eat the things myself.
The same rule applies equally to television, as it does to a great many
other things. Like most human beings, I enjoy some things and don’t
enjoy others, and in the vast majority of these cases, nobody feels
particularly threatened by the fact that I don’t like something they do,
and avoid it for that sensible reason. For this one commenter, at least,
that obviously wasn’t the case, and it’s worth reflecting on the vast
personal insecurities that must have driven such a bizarre reaction.
Still, that was one of a kind, so we’ll pass on to the others.
A theme that showed up rather more often in the hate mail responding to
last week’s post was the insistence that if I don’t have a television, a
microwave, or a cell phone, I’m a hypocrite if I have an internet
connection. I encourage my readers to think about that claim for a
moment. I suppose a case could be made that if my lack of interest in
having a television, a microwave, or a cell phone was motivated by the
kind of passion for hair-shirt asceticism mentioned above, and I had an
internet connection, I could be accused of the kind of slacking that
used to get you thrown out of the really top-notch hermitages. From any
other perspective, it’s a triumph of absurdity. If people are in fact
allowed to choose, from among the currently available technologies,
those that make them happiest—as the cheerleaders of the consumer
economy delight to insist—what could possibly be wrong with choosing
some old technologies and some newer ones, if that’s the mix you prefer?
Then there are the people whose response to the technology of an older
time is to yammer endlessly about whatever bad things happened in those
days, even when the bad things in question had nothing to do with the
technology and vice versa. People like the couple I discussed in last
week’s post, who prefer Victorian furnishings and clothing to their
modern equivalents, get this sort of bizarre non sequitur all the time,
but variants of it turned up in my inbox last week as well. Here again,
there’s some heavy-duty illogic involved. If a technology that was
invented and used in the 1850s, say, is permanently tarred with the
various social evils of that era, and ought to be rejected because those
evils happened, wouldn’t that also mean that the internet is just as
indelibly tarred with the social evils of the modern era, and ought to
be discarded because bad things are happening in the world today? What’s
sauce for the goose, after all, is sauce for the gander...
Finally, there’s the capstone of the whole edifice of unreason, the
insistence that anybody who doesn’t use the latest, hottest technotrash
wants to go “back to the caves,” or to even take all of humanity to that
much-denounced destination. “The caves” have a bizarre gravitational
effect on the imagination of a certain class of modern thinkers. Everything that’s not part of the latest assortment of glitzy
technogimmicks, in their minds, somehow morphs into the bearskin kilts
and wooden clubs that so many of us still, despite well over a century
of detailed archeological evidence, insist on pushing onto our
prehistoric ancestors.
When people of this kind archly dismiss people like the Chrismans, the
neo-Victorian couple just mentioned, as going “back to the caves,”
they’re engaged in a very interesting kind of absurdity. Do cavemen and
Victorians belong on the same level? Sure, cavemen had flush toilets and
central heating, daily newspapers and public libraries, not to mention
factories, railways, global maritime trade, a telegraph network covering
much of the planet’s land surface, and a great deal more of the same
kind! That’s absurd, of course. It’s even more absurd to insist that
people who simply don’t enjoy using this or that technology, and so
don’t use it, are going back to “the caves”—but I can promise you, dear
reader, from my own personal experience, that if you show a lack of
interest in any piece of fashionable technology, you’ll have this phrase
thrown at you.
That happens because “the caves” aren’t real. They aren’t, for example,
the actual cave-shrines of the Magdalenian people who lived fifteen
thousand years ago, whose lifestyles were quite similar to those of
Native Americans before Columbus, and who used to go deep into the caves
of Europe to paint sacred images that still stun the viewer today by
their beauty and artistry. “The caves” of contemporary rhetoric, rather,
are thoughtstopping abstractions, bits of verbal noise that people have
been taught to use so they don’t ask inconvenient questions about where
this thing called “progress” is taking us and whether any sane person
would actually want to go there. Flattening out the entire complex
richness of the human past into a single cardboard bogeyman labeled “the
caves” is one way to do that.  So is papering over the distinctly ugly
future we’re making for ourselves with a screen shot or two from a
Jetsons cartoon and a gaudy banner saying “We’re headed for the stars!”
It’s really rather fascinating, all things considered, that the image of
the cave should have been picked up for that dubious purpose. Not that
long ago, most literate people in the Western world tended to have a
very different image come to mind when someone mentioned caves. That was
courtesy of a man named Aristocles of Athens, who lived a little more
than 2300 years ago and whose very broad shoulders got him the nickname
Plato. In the longest, most influential, and most problematic of his
works, usually called The Republic—a bad choice, as this word nowadays
has connotations of rights under law that the Greek title Politeia
lacks—he framed his discussion of the gap between perception and reality
with an arresting image.
Imagine, Plato says, that we are all shackled in a cave, unable to turn
our heads to either side. All we can see are dark shapes that move this
way and that on the flat wall of the cave in front of us. Those dark
shapes are all we know.  They are our reality.
Now imagine that one of these prisoners manages to get loose from his
shackles, and turns away from the cave wall and the dark shapes on it.
He’s in for a shock, because what he sees when he turns around is a
bonfire, and people moving objects in front of the flames so that the
objects cast shadows on the cave wall. Everything he thought was reality
is simply a shadow cast by these moving objects.
If the prisoner who’s gotten loose pays attention, furthermore, he might
just notice that the cave isn’t limited to the bonfire, the prisoners,
the objects casting the shadows and the people who manipulate those
objects. Off past the bonfire, on one side of the cave, the floor slopes
upwards, and in the distance is a faint light that doesn’t seem to come
from the fire If our escaped prisoner is brave enough, he might
decide to go investigate that light. As he does so, the bonfire and the
shadows slip into the darkness behind him, and the light ahead grows
brighter and clearer.
Then, if he’s brave enough and keeps going, he steps out of the cave and
into the sunlight. That’s not an easy thing, either, because the light
is so much more intense than the dim red glow in the cave that for a
while, he can’t see a thing. He stumbles, rubs his eyes, tries to find
his bearings, and discovers that the detailed knowledge he had of the
way shadows moved on the cave wall won’t help him at all in this new,
blazingly bright realm. He has to discard everything he thinks he knows,
and learn the rules of an unfamiliar world.
Bit by bit, though, he accomplishes this. His eyes adapt to the
sunlight, he learns to recognize objects and to sense things—color, for
example, and depth—which didn’t exist in the shadow-world he thought he
inhabited when he was still a prisoner in the cave. Eventually he can
even see the sun, and know where the light that illumines the real world
actually comes from.
Now, Plato says, imagine that he decides to go back into the cave to
tell the remaining prisoners what he’s seen. To begin with, it’s going
to be rough going, because his eyes have adapted to the brilliant
daylight and so he’s going to trip and stumble on the way down. Once he
gets there, anything he says to the prisoners is going to be dismissed
as the most consummate rubbish:  what is this nonsense about color and
depth, and a big bright glowing thing that crosses something called the
sky? What’s more, the people to whom he’s addressing his words are going
to misunderstand them, thinking that they’re about the shadow-world in
front of their eyes—after all, that’s the only reality they know—and
they’re going to decide that he must be an idiot because nothing he says
has anything to do with the shadow-world.
Plato didn’t mention that the prisoners might respond by trying to drag
the escapee back into line with them and bully him into putting his
shackles back on, though that’s generally the way such things work out
in practice. Plato also never saw a television, which is unfortunate in
a way—if he had, he could have skipped the complicated setup with the
bonfire and the people waving around objects that cast shadows, and
simply said, “Imagine that we’re all watching television in a dark room.”
Now of course Plato had his own reasons for using the cave metaphor, and
developed it in directions that aren’t relevant to this week’s post. The
point I want to make here is that every technology is a filter that
shapes the way we experience and interact with the world. In some cases,
such as television, the filtering effect is so drastic it’s hard not to
see—unless, that is, you don’t want to see it.  In other cases, it’s
subtle. There are valid reasons people might want to use one filter
rather than another, or to set aside an assortment of filters in order
to get a clearer view of some part of the world or their lives.
There are also, as already noted, matters of personal choice. Some of us
prefer sun and wind and depth and color to the play of shadows on the
walls of the cave. That doesn’t mean that we’re going to drag those who
don’t share that preference out into the blinding light, or that we’re
going to turn ourselves into the Throg the Cave Man shadow that’s being
waved around so enthusiastically on one corner of the cave wall. It does
mean—or so the response to last week’s post suggests—that a significant
number of people are losing interest in the shadow-play and clambering
up the awkward but rewarding journey into the sunlight and the clean
cool air, and it may just mean as well that those who try to bully them
into staying put and staring at shadows may have less success than they
On an entirely personal note, I’m pleased to report that Founders House
Publishing has just brought out a new edition of my first science
fiction novel, The Fires of Shalsha. It’s closer to mainstream SF than
anything else I’ve written—it’s even set on another planet—but fans of
my subsequent novels, Star’s Reach and Twilight’s Last Gleaming, will
find it an enjoyable read. Copies can be ordered here.

Was The U.S. Involved In The Turkish Attack Against The Russian Jet?
    Erdogan criticized Syria harshly on Tuesday for shooting down the
Turkish fighter jet, saying: "Even if the plane was in their airspace
for a few seconds, that is no excuse to attack."
    "It was clear that this plane was not an aggressive plane. Still it
was shot down," he said.Turkey hardens military position after Syria
downs jet June 27, 2012
    A violation of one to two kilometers is accepted as "natural" given
the speed of aircraft, the statement [by the the General Staff] said.
This year's violations of Turkish airspace lasted between 20 seconds and
nine minutes, which showed "airspace violations can be resolved by
warning and interceptions," the statement said.
    Turkey could have downed 114 planes for airspace violations: Army
June 25, 2012
    Turkish fighter jets and military helicopters have dramatically
increased their incursions into Greek airspace, according to a study
based on data from the Greek military, forcing the cash-strapped Greek
air force to respond.
    Turkey buzzes weakened Greece - In growing numbers Ankara’s fighter
jets test Greek territorial claims. - July 23, 2015
Turkey also regularly violates Iraq's airspace by flying bombing attacks
against Kurds in north Iraq.
All this provides that yesterday's incident in which Turkey shot down a
Russian jet was not a case of an ordinary airspace violation but a
deliberate act to take down a Russian plane. The surviving co-pilot of
the Russian jet insists that it neither flew through Turkish airspace
nor was warned of an imminent attack. As I wrote yesterday:
    This then was not legitimate air-defense but an ambush.
I am not the only one who came to that conclusion. Deep inside a
McClatchy piece a "western" diplomat sees it as an "orchestrated" event:
    One Western diplomat based in Iraq, but with extensive experience in
Syria and Turkey, called the incident “brazenly orchestrated and
inevitable,” but asked that the identification of his country not be
used in the statement.
The Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov also came to that conclusion:
    The downing of a Russian warplane in Syria by Turkey appears to be a
pre-planned provocation, the Russian Foreign Minister said. Ankara
failed to communicate with Russia over the incident, he added.
    “We have serious doubts that this act was unintentional. It looks
very much like a preplanned provocation,” Lavrov said, citing Turkey’s
failure to maintain proper communication with Russia, the abundance of
footage of the incident and other evidence.
Several NATO ambassadors will have had the same though when they
admonished Ankara over the act:
    "There are other ways of dealing with these kinds of incidents,"
said one diplomat who declined to be named.
The attack on the Russian plane was preconceived on November 22 when a
security summit was held with the Turkish government under Prime
Minister Davutoğlu and the Turkish Armed Forces. Davutoğlu personally
gave the order to shoot down Russian planes. This, Turkey says, was
necessary to stop Russian bombing of "Turkmen" in north Syria's Latakia
near the Turkish border.
Many of the "Syrian Turkmen" fighting against the Syrian people are from
Central Asia and part of the terrorist groups of Jabhat al-Nusra, Ansar
Al Shams, Jabhat Ansar Ad Din and Ahrar al Shams. Uighurs smuggled in
from China and fighting under the "Turkistan Islamist Party" label even
advertise their ‘little jihadists’ children training camps in the area.
The few real Syrian Turkmen work, as even the BBC admits, together with
al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Their leader and spokesman, one
Alparslan Celik, is a Turkish citizen from Elazığ.
The Turkish claim of defending "Turkmen" in Syria is a sham. It is
defending mostly foreign Islamist terrorists.
Whoever planned the ambush on the Russian jet miscalculated the
reaction. NATO will not come to Turkey's help over this or the next such
incident. NATO countries know that the Russian plane was hit within
Syria. Russia will not be scared into drawing back. Instead it massively
increased the bombing of targets in that area:
    At least 12 air strikes hit Latakia's northern countryside as
pro-government forces clashed with fighters from al Qaeda's Nusra Front
and Turkmen insurgents in the Jabal Akrad and Jabal Turkman areas, the
British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
    A Turkmen commander said missiles fired from Russian warships in the
Mediterranean were also hitting the area, as well as heavy artillery
Russian jets also bombed insurgency supply trucks (video) in al-Qaeda
controlled Azaz, north of Aleppo and just some two kilometers from the
Turkish border. They also bombed the Bab al-Hawa border crossing to
Turkey. That is a big FU to Erdogan.
The Russian missile cruiser Moskva with its extensive air defense
systems is now covering the area. Russia will officially deploy two
S-400 air defense systems to cover all of north-west Syria and southern
Turkey. Russia also has lots of electronic wizardry it can (and will)
apply. The preparation of additional airfields is ongoing. There will be
no outward military revenge against Turkey unless it crosses into Syria.
The "safe zone" within Syria Erdogan dreams of would have to be won by
defeating Russian forces.
The 4.5 million Russian tourists who visited Turkey this year will not
come again. Turkish business in Russia, mostly in the building industry
and agricultural products, will shrink to nearly zero. That the scheming
to take down a Russian air plane may have negative consequences for
Turkey suddenly also dawned to Davutoğlu who now pretends that we wants
to make nice again:
    Turkey is not aiming to escalate tension with Russia, Turkish Prime
Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu said Nov. 25, echoing President Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan following the downing of a SU-24 Russian jet the previous day.
    “Russia is our friend and neighbor. Our bilateral communication
channels are open. But our security, as for every friendly country,
should be based on the principle of respect under international law.
It’s normal to protect our national airspace,” Davutoğlu said,
addressing party members in parliament.
And it is normal for Russia to defend its ally Syria. Against all
enemies. By all means.
But back to Turkey's motive. The way this is played one might believe
that this was a indeed a lonely Turkish idea to defend its immediate
interests in Syria - the "Turkmen" as well as the oil business Erdogan's
son has with the Islamic State.
But there is also a bigger game going on and it is likely that Erdogan
has a new contract and Obama's backing for this escalation. James
Winnefeld, the deputy chief of General Staff of the U.S. military, was
in Ankara when the incident happened. The cooperation between U.S. and
Turkish military and especially the air forces is quite tight. It is
hard to believe that there was no communication about what was prepared
to happen.
After the Islamic State attack in France President Hollande attempted to
create a global coalition against IS which would include Russia and Iran
as well as the U.S. led anti-ISIS block. But such a coalition, which
makes a lot of sense, would have to agree to leave Syria alone and to
help Syrian ground forces to effectively fight the Islamic State. It
does not make sense to destroy the Syrian state and to just hope that
the outcome would be something better than an emboldened IS or AlQaeda
ruling in Damascus. That outcome is certainly not in Europe's interest.
But a global coalition is not in U.S. or Turkish interests. It would end
their common plans and efforts to overthrow the Syrian government and to
install a "Sunni" state in Syria and Iraq as a Turkish protectorate.
The Russian jet incident decreased the likelihood of such a coalition.
Holland, visiting Washington yesterday, had to pull back with his plan
and was again degraded to parrot Obama's "Assad must go" nonsense. Obama
feels emboldened and now pushes to widen the conflict in Syria:
    The Obama administration is using the current moment of extreme
anger and anxiety in Europe to press allies for sharp increases in their
contributions to the fight against the Islamic State. Suggestions
include more strike aircraft, more intelligence-sharing, more training
and equipment for local fighters, and deployment of their own special
operations ­forces.
    ...
    While new contributions would be added to anti-Islamic State
campaigns across the board, the attention is clearly on Syria, marking a
shift in what began as an “Iraq first” focus when Obama authorized
airstrikes in the region last fall.
    ...
    Obama, speaking beside Hollande on Tuesday, restated his insistence
that Assad is part of the problem, not the solution, and that he must go.
The Obama administration is also preparing to install the Turkish dream
of a "safe zone" between Aleppo and the Turkish border north of it.
    Among several coalition priorities in Syria, the United States has
begun a series of airstrikes in an area known as the “Mar’a line,” named
for a town north of Aleppo in the northwest. There, a 60-mile stretch to
the Euphrates River in the east is the only remaining part of the
Syria-Turkey border under Islamic State control.
    The administration had delayed beginning operations in the area
because U.S. aircraft were needed in operations farther east, and it has
been uncertain that local opposition forces­ would be able to hold the
territory if it could be cleared with airstrikes.
The increased Russian air defense and the likely increase of its
deployed planes will make those "safe zone" plans impossible.
But Obama, in my conclusion, still wants to drag NATO into Syria and
wants to assemble enough forces "against ISIS" to be able to overwhelm
the Syrian government and its Russian protectors. If that does not work
he at least hopes to give Russia the Afghanistan like "quagmire" in
Syria he and other U.S. officials promised. The again increasing
tensions with U.S. proxy Ukraine only help in that regard.
But there is even more to that plan. Just by chance (not) the NYT op-ed
pages launch a trial balloon today for the creation of a Sunni state in
east Syria and west Iraq. But that (Islamic) State is already there and
the "containment" strategy Obama practices towards it guarantees that it
will fester.
Obama continues his immensely destructive policies in the Middle East
with zero regard to the all the bad outcomes these are likely to have
for the people there as well as for Europe. One again wonders if all
these action follow from sheer incompetence or from some devilish,
ingenious strategic planning.

The Shadows in the Cave
I had intended this week’s post to be the next episode in the Retrotopia
narrative, chronicling Peter Carr’s meeting with the irrepressible Col.
Tom Pappas of the Lakeland Republic Army, and the trip out to Defiance
County for the annual drone shoot, but that will have to wait another
week. No, I haven’t decided to comment instead on the recent spate of
terror attacks in France.  As people in a variety of other corners of
the world have pointed out, identical outrages happen all over the Third
World every few days.  The only reason this latest horror has gotten so
much air time is that it affected people in one of the world’s
privileged countries instead.
Nor am I going to be devoting this week’s post to the latest, extremely
troubling round of news from the climate change front—though that’s
going to get a post to itself down the road a bit, when I’ve had time to
do a little more research. That’s a far bigger story than the terror
attacks in Paris, though of course it’s not getting anything like as
much attention in the media.  From the beginning of serious salt water
infiltration into South Florida’s aquifers, through ominously bulging
sediments in Arctic Ocean shallows, to an assortment of truly
frightening data points from Greenland, it’s clear that we’ve passed the
threshold from “something may happen someday” to “something is happening
now”—a transition that probably has quite a bit to do with the
increasingly shrill tone of climate-change denialist rhetoric just now,
and even more to do with the increasingly plaintive tone of those
activists who still insist that everything can be fixed if we all just
join hands and sing “Kum ba ya” one more time.
No, this week’s post is going to explore a topic that’s far less
important in the overall scheme of things, though it’s not without its
relevance to the crisis of our age. I want to talk about the reaction I
fielded in response to last week’s post here on The Archdruid Report,
which was an exploration of our culture’s taboo against choosing not to
use the latest technologies.
I expected that post to field its share of outraged denunciations, and
it certainly did. What I didn’t expect was that it would receive more
comments than any other post in the history of The Archdruid Report, and
the vast majority of those comments would agree heartily with the two
points of that post. The first of these points is that there’s a
significant number of Americans out there who, for one good reason or
another, choose not to use cell phones, televisions, automobiles,
microwave ovens, and an assortment of other currently fashionable
technologies. The second is that there’s an even larger number of
Americans out there who get really, really freaky about people who make
such choices.
Some of the stories I heard from readers of my blog were absolute
classics of the type. There was the couple who don’t enjoy television
and so don’t own one, and had a relative ask them every single year,
over and over again, if she could buy them a television for Christmas. They said no thank you every single year, and finally she went out and
bought them a television anyway because she just couldn’t stand the
thought that they weren’t watching one. There was the coworker who
plopped a laptop playing some sitcom or other right down on the lap of
one of my readers and demanded that the reader watch it, right then and
there, so that they would have something to talk about. There was the
person who, offended by another reader’s lack of interest in television,
finally shouted, “You must be living in a dream world!” Er, which of
these people was spending four to six hours a day watching paid actors
playing imaginary characters act out fictional events in contrived settings?
Televisions were far from the only focus of this sort of technobullying.
Other readers reported getting similar reactions from other people
because they didn’t happen to have, and weren’t interested in having,
microwave ovens, smartphones, and so on down the list of currently
fashionable trinkets. The stories are really quite eye-opening, and not
in a good way. Forget about all the popular cant that insists that
you’re free in the USA to make your own choices and have whatever
lifestyle you want.  According to a significant fraction of
Americans—and to judge from what my readers reported, that fraction
isn’t limited to any one class, income level, or region of the
country—the only freedom you’re supposed to exercise, when it comes to
technology, is that of choosing which brand label will be slapped on
each item in the officially approved list of devices you’re expected to own.
The prevalence of technobullying and technoshaming in today’s America is
a fascinating point, and one we’ll explore in a few moments, with the
able assistance of the denunciations flung at last week’s post by the
minority of readers who reacted that way. What I want to consider first
is the fact that so many people responded to last week’s post so
positively. One blog in an uncrowded corner of the internet, written by
an author whose day job as an archdruid locates him squarely on the
outer fringes of contemporary American life, is very nearly the opposite
of a statistically valid poll. Still, the sheer volume of the response
makes me suspect that something significant is going on here.
By that I don’t mean that there’s some sort of groundswell of
renunciation, leading people to walk away from technologies in the same
spirit that led medieval ascetics to don hair shirts and flog themselves
for the good of their souls. That’s one of the common stereotypes
directed at those of us who aren’t interested in the latest technotrash,
and it completely misses what’s actually going on. I’ll use myself as an
example here. I don’t own a television—I haven’t owned one in my adult
life—and it’s not because I have some moral or political objection to
televisions, or because I’m into self-denial, or what have you. I don’t
own a television because I find watching television about as enticing as
eating a bowl of warm snot.
It’s not the programming, either—that’s another of the standard
stereotypes, that the only thing one can find objectionable about
television is the programming, and it’s as inaccurate as the rest.  To
me, quite simply, the activity of watching little colored shapes jerk
around on a screen is boring and irritating, not relaxing and enjoyable,
no matter what the little colored shapes are supposed to be doing. Yes,
I grew up with a television in the house.  I experienced plenty of it
back in the day, and I have zero interest in experiencing any more,
because I don’t like it. It really is that simple. It’s that simple for
others as well: they don’t find this or that technology enjoyable,
useful, or relevant to their lifestyles, and so they’ve chosen to do
something else with their money and time. Shouldn’t so simple and
personal a choice be their own business, and nobody else’s?
To judge by the reactions that those who make such choices routinely
field, apparently not. The pushbacks discussed in the comments page last
week range from the sort of in-your-face confrontations discussed above
to a much-forwarded article in I forget which online rag, where somebody
was airily announcing that he wasn’t interested in being friends with
somebody unless he could text some vacuous comment about lunch to the
other person at 2:15 and get a response by 2:30. (My readers and I are
good with that—somebody who insists on getting immediate feedback for
their random outbursts of mental flatulence isn’t somebody we want as a
friend, either.) Then there were the indignant responses to last week’s
post, which belong in a category by themselves.
I’m sorry to say that my favorite diatribe didn’t show up in the comment
queue for The Archdruid Report. It appeared instead on one of the many
other websites that carry my weekly posts, and it insisted, among
several other less juicy bits, that my lack of enthusiasm for television
obviously meant that I was conspiring to deprive everyone else of their
teevees. You’ve got to admit that for sheer giddy delirium, that one’s
hard to beat. By the same logic, if I dislike peanuts—as in fact I do—I
must be committed to some kind of anti-peanut crusade devoted to
eradicating the entire species. Not so;  Arachis hypogaea is welcome to
live and thrive, for all I care, and my fellow hominids are equally
welcome to eat as much of its produce as they happen to desire.  In
fact, they can divide my share among them. The only thing I ask in
return is that nobody expect me to eat the things myself.
The same rule applies equally to television, as it does to a great many
other things. Like most human beings, I enjoy some things and don’t
enjoy others, and in the vast majority of these cases, nobody feels
particularly threatened by the fact that I don’t like something they do,
and avoid it for that sensible reason. For this one commenter, at least,
that obviously wasn’t the case, and it’s worth reflecting on the vast
personal insecurities that must have driven such a bizarre reaction.
Still, that was one of a kind, so we’ll pass on to the others.
A theme that showed up rather more often in the hate mail responding to
last week’s post was the insistence that if I don’t have a television, a
microwave, or a cell phone, I’m a hypocrite if I have an internet
connection. I encourage my readers to think about that claim for a
moment. I suppose a case could be made that if my lack of interest in
having a television, a microwave, or a cell phone was motivated by the
kind of passion for hair-shirt asceticism mentioned above, and I had an
internet connection, I could be accused of the kind of slacking that
used to get you thrown out of the really top-notch hermitages. From any
other perspective, it’s a triumph of absurdity. If people are in fact
allowed to choose, from among the currently available technologies,
those that make them happiest—as the cheerleaders of the consumer
economy delight to insist—what could possibly be wrong with choosing
some old technologies and some newer ones, if that’s the mix you prefer?
Then there are the people whose response to the technology of an older
time is to yammer endlessly about whatever bad things happened in those
days, even when the bad things in question had nothing to do with the
technology and vice versa. People like the couple I discussed in last
week’s post, who prefer Victorian furnishings and clothing to their
modern equivalents, get this sort of bizarre non sequitur all the time,
but variants of it turned up in my inbox last week as well. Here again,
there’s some heavy-duty illogic involved. If a technology that was
invented and used in the 1850s, say, is permanently tarred with the
various social evils of that era, and ought to be rejected because those
evils happened, wouldn’t that also mean that the internet is just as
indelibly tarred with the social evils of the modern era, and ought to
be discarded because bad things are happening in the world today? What’s
sauce for the goose, after all, is sauce for the gander...
Finally, there’s the capstone of the whole edifice of unreason, the
insistence that anybody who doesn’t use the latest, hottest technotrash
wants to go “back to the caves,” or to even take all of humanity to that
much-denounced destination. “The caves” have a bizarre gravitational
effect on the imagination of a certain class of modern thinkers. Everything that’s not part of the latest assortment of glitzy
technogimmicks, in their minds, somehow morphs into the bearskin kilts
and wooden clubs that so many of us still, despite well over a century
of detailed archeological evidence, insist on pushing onto our
prehistoric ancestors.
When people of this kind archly dismiss people like the Chrismans, the
neo-Victorian couple just mentioned, as going “back to the caves,”
they’re engaged in a very interesting kind of absurdity. Do cavemen and
Victorians belong on the same level? Sure, cavemen had flush toilets and
central heating, daily newspapers and public libraries, not to mention
factories, railways, global maritime trade, a telegraph network covering
much of the planet’s land surface, and a great deal more of the same
kind! That’s absurd, of course. It’s even more absurd to insist that
people who simply don’t enjoy using this or that technology, and so
don’t use it, are going back to “the caves”—but I can promise you, dear
reader, from my own personal experience, that if you show a lack of
interest in any piece of fashionable technology, you’ll have this phrase
thrown at you.
That happens because “the caves” aren’t real. They aren’t, for example,
the actual cave-shrines of the Magdalenian people who lived fifteen
thousand years ago, whose lifestyles were quite similar to those of
Native Americans before Columbus, and who used to go deep into the caves
of Europe to paint sacred images that still stun the viewer today by
their beauty and artistry. “The caves” of contemporary rhetoric, rather,
are thoughtstopping abstractions, bits of verbal noise that people have
been taught to use so they don’t ask inconvenient questions about where
this thing called “progress” is taking us and whether any sane person
would actually want to go there. Flattening out the entire complex
richness of the human past into a single cardboard bogeyman labeled “the
caves” is one way to do that.  So is papering over the distinctly ugly
future we’re making for ourselves with a screen shot or two from a
Jetsons cartoon and a gaudy banner saying “We’re headed for the stars!”
It’s really rather fascinating, all things considered, that the image of
the cave should have been picked up for that dubious purpose. Not that
long ago, most literate people in the Western world tended to have a
very different image come to mind when someone mentioned caves. That was
courtesy of a man named Aristocles of Athens, who lived a little more
than 2300 years ago and whose very broad shoulders got him the nickname
Plato. In the longest, most influential, and most problematic of his
works, usually called The Republic—a bad choice, as this word nowadays
has connotations of rights under law that the Greek title Politeia
lacks—he framed his discussion of the gap between perception and reality
with an arresting image.
Imagine, Plato says, that we are all shackled in a cave, unable to turn
our heads to either side. All we can see are dark shapes that move this
way and that on the flat wall of the cave in front of us. Those dark
shapes are all we know.  They are our reality.
Now imagine that one of these prisoners manages to get loose from his
shackles, and turns away from the cave wall and the dark shapes on it.
He’s in for a shock, because what he sees when he turns around is a
bonfire, and people moving objects in front of the flames so that the
objects cast shadows on the cave wall. Everything he thought was reality
is simply a shadow cast by these moving objects.
If the prisoner who’s gotten loose pays attention, furthermore, he might
just notice that the cave isn’t limited to the bonfire, the prisoners,
the objects casting the shadows and the people who manipulate those
objects. Off past the bonfire, on one side of the cave, the floor slopes
upwards, and in the distance is a faint light that doesn’t seem to come
from the fire If our escaped prisoner is brave enough, he might
decide to go investigate that light. As he does so, the bonfire and the
shadows slip into the darkness behind him, and the light ahead grows
brighter and clearer.
Then, if he’s brave enough and keeps going, he steps out of the cave and
into the sunlight. That’s not an easy thing, either, because the light
is so much more intense than the dim red glow in the cave that for a
while, he can’t see a thing. He stumbles, rubs his eyes, tries to find
his bearings, and discovers that the detailed knowledge he had of the
way shadows moved on the cave wall won’t help him at all in this new,
blazingly bright realm. He has to discard everything he thinks he knows,
and learn the rules of an unfamiliar world.
Bit by bit, though, he accomplishes this. His eyes adapt to the
sunlight, he learns to recognize objects and to sense things—color, for
example, and depth—which didn’t exist in the shadow-world he thought he
inhabited when he was still a prisoner in the cave. Eventually he can
even see the sun, and know where the light that illumines the real world
actually comes from.
Now, Plato says, imagine that he decides to go back into the cave to
tell the remaining prisoners what he’s seen. To begin with, it’s going
to be rough going, because his eyes have adapted to the brilliant
daylight and so he’s going to trip and stumble on the way down. Once he
gets there, anything he says to the prisoners is going to be dismissed
as the most consummate rubbish:  what is this nonsense about color and
depth, and a big bright glowing thing that crosses something called the
sky? What’s more, the people to whom he’s addressing his words are going
to misunderstand them, thinking that they’re about the shadow-world in
front of their eyes—after all, that’s the only reality they know—and
they’re going to decide that he must be an idiot because nothing he says
has anything to do with the shadow-world.
Plato didn’t mention that the prisoners might respond by trying to drag
the escapee back into line with them and bully him into putting his
shackles back on, though that’s generally the way such things work out
in practice. Plato also never saw a television, which is unfortunate in
a way—if he had, he could have skipped the complicated setup with the
bonfire and the people waving around objects that cast shadows, and
simply said, “Imagine that we’re all watching television in a dark room.”
Now of course Plato had his own reasons for using the cave metaphor, and
developed it in directions that aren’t relevant to this week’s post. The
point I want to make here is that every technology is a filter that
shapes the way we experience and interact with the world. In some cases,
such as television, the filtering effect is so drastic it’s hard not to
see—unless, that is, you don’t want to see it.  In other cases, it’s
subtle. There are valid reasons people might want to use one filter
rather than another, or to set aside an assortment of filters in order
to get a clearer view of some part of the world or their lives.
There are also, as already noted, matters of personal choice. Some of us
prefer sun and wind and depth and color to the play of shadows on the
walls of the cave. That doesn’t mean that we’re going to drag those who
don’t share that preference out into the blinding light, or that we’re
going to turn ourselves into the Throg the Cave Man shadow that’s being
waved around so enthusiastically on one corner of the cave wall. It does
mean—or so the response to last week’s post suggests—that a significant
number of people are losing interest in the shadow-play and clambering
up the awkward but rewarding journey into the sunlight and the clean
cool air, and it may just mean as well that those who try to bully them
into staying put and staring at shadows may have less success than they
On an entirely personal note, I’m pleased to report that Founders House
Publishing has just brought out a new edition of my first science
fiction novel, The Fires of Shalsha. It’s closer to mainstream SF than
anything else I’ve written—it’s even set on another planet—but fans of
my subsequent novels, Star’s Reach and Twilight’s Last Gleaming, will
find it an enjoyable read. Copies can be ordered here.

Vladimir Putin could really give a flying fuck who one fucks. No one in
Russia really does, and making table conversation out of one's sexual
preferences is a uniquely 'Merican phenome. Last week some guy at my
favorite coffee shop, who I barely know, started telling me, at SEVEN
AM, about the transgendered person he met last night and how sex with
the TG was a whole new... Get the picture? TMI! I couldn't shut the guy
up until I literally started screaming at him, bringing the verbal
altercation to the attention of a not-amused barista.
Russia is making laws about discussing LGBT, if indeed the law even does
that (can't tell by US reporting of the issue),  because THE ONLY PEOPLE
who would care to do so ... are people with AGENDAS. Ie. George Soros'
color-rev bffs. A while back I read an article about a LGBT nightclub in
St Petersburg that was thrashed by an alleged anti-gay 'wrecking crew'.
The bar owner said, and I quote, "They weren't from around here". Right.
There's your 'color revolutionary' CIA team at work doing some
perception management.
Ps. The US military is DESPERATE for soldiers, and if you gay and
stupid, and have no morals or ethics, YOU can be "Liberated" and join
the murder machine. A good number of war stories I've read recently in
the US media pander to how gay people are being oppressed in X country
we're on the verge of war with, so put down the butt plug boy, and enlist!

Glad you used the word "Can", as in not indicating that would ever

@_subject: Moon of Alabama: Context Of Yesterday's Turkish Attack Against The 
This article is copiously linked at Moon of Alabama
November 25, 2015
Was The U.S. Involved In The Turkish Attack Against The Russian Jet?
    Erdogan criticized Syria harshly on Tuesday for shooting down the
Turkish fighter jet, saying: "Even if the plane was in their airspace
for a few seconds, that is no excuse to attack."
    "It was clear that this plane was not an aggressive plane. Still it
was shot down," he said.Turkey hardens military position after Syria
downs jet June 27, 2012
    A violation of one to two kilometers is accepted as "natural" given
the speed of aircraft, the statement [by the the General Staff] said.
This year's violations of Turkish airspace lasted between 20 seconds and
nine minutes, which showed "airspace violations can be resolved by
warning and interceptions," the statement said.
    Turkey could have downed 114 planes for airspace violations: Army
June 25, 2012
    Turkish fighter jets and military helicopters have dramatically
increased their incursions into Greek airspace, according to a study
based on data from the Greek military, forcing the cash-strapped Greek
air force to respond.
    Turkey buzzes weakened Greece - In growing numbers Ankara’s fighter
jets test Greek territorial claims. - July 23, 2015
Turkey also regularly violates Iraq's airspace by flying bombing attacks
against Kurds in north Iraq.
All this provides that yesterday's incident in which Turkey shot down a
Russian jet was not a case of an ordinary airspace violation but a
deliberate act to take down a Russian plane. The surviving co-pilot of
the Russian jet insists that it neither flew through Turkish airspace
nor was warned of an imminent attack. As I wrote yesterday:
    This then was not legitimate air-defense but an ambush.
I am not the only one who came to that conclusion. Deep inside a
McClatchy piece a "western" diplomat sees it as an "orchestrated" event:
    One Western diplomat based in Iraq, but with extensive experience in
Syria and Turkey, called the incident “brazenly orchestrated and
inevitable,” but asked that the identification of his country not be
used in the statement.
The Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov also came to that conclusion:
    The downing of a Russian warplane in Syria by Turkey appears to be a
pre-planned provocation, the Russian Foreign Minister said. Ankara
failed to communicate with Russia over the incident, he added.
    “We have serious doubts that this act was unintentional. It looks
very much like a preplanned provocation,” Lavrov said, citing Turkey’s
failure to maintain proper communication with Russia, the abundance of
footage of the incident and other evidence.
Several NATO ambassadors will have had the same though when they
admonished Ankara over the act:
    "There are other ways of dealing with these kinds of incidents,"
said one diplomat who declined to be named.
The attack on the Russian plane was preconceived on November 22 when a
security summit was held with the Turkish government under Prime
Minister Davutoğlu and the Turkish Armed Forces. Davutoğlu personally
gave the order to shoot down Russian planes. This, Turkey says, was
necessary to stop Russian bombing of "Turkmen" in north Syria's Latakia
near the Turkish border.
Many of the "Syrian Turkmen" fighting against the Syrian people are from
Central Asia and part of the terrorist groups of Jabhat al-Nusra, Ansar
Al Shams, Jabhat Ansar Ad Din and Ahrar al Shams. Uighurs smuggled in
from China and fighting under the "Turkistan Islamist Party" label even
advertise their ‘little jihadists’ children training camps in the area.
The few real Syrian Turkmen work, as even the BBC admits, together with
al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Their leader and spokesman, one
Alparslan Celik, is a Turkish citizen from Elazığ.
The Turkish claim of defending "Turkmen" in Syria is a sham. It is
defending mostly foreign Islamist terrorists.
Whoever planned the ambush on the Russian jet miscalculated the
reaction. NATO will not come to Turkey's help over this or the next such
incident. NATO countries know that the Russian plane was hit within
Syria. Russia will not be scared into drawing back. Instead it massively
increased the bombing of targets in that area:
    At least 12 air strikes hit Latakia's northern countryside as
pro-government forces clashed with fighters from al Qaeda's Nusra Front
and Turkmen insurgents in the Jabal Akrad and Jabal Turkman areas, the
British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
    A Turkmen commander said missiles fired from Russian warships in the
Mediterranean were also hitting the area, as well as heavy artillery
Russian jets also bombed insurgency supply trucks (video) in al-Qaeda
controlled Azaz, north of Aleppo and just some two kilometers from the
Turkish border. They also bombed the Bab al-Hawa border crossing to
Turkey. That is a big FU to Erdogan.
The Russian missile cruiser Moskva with its extensive air defense
systems is now covering the area. Russia will officially deploy two
S-400 air defense systems to cover all of north-west Syria and southern
Turkey. Russia also has lots of electronic wizardry it can (and will)
apply. The preparation of additional airfields is ongoing. There will be
no outward military revenge against Turkey unless it crosses into Syria.
The "safe zone" within Syria Erdogan dreams of would have to be won by
defeating Russian forces.
The 4.5 million Russian tourists who visited Turkey this year will not
come again. Turkish business in Russia, mostly in the building industry
and agricultural products, will shrink to nearly zero. That the scheming
to take down a Russian air plane may have negative consequences for
Turkey suddenly also dawned to Davutoğlu who now pretends that we wants
to make nice again:
    Turkey is not aiming to escalate tension with Russia, Turkish Prime
Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu said Nov. 25, echoing President Recep Tayyip
Erdoğan following the downing of a SU-24 Russian jet the previous day.
    “Russia is our friend and neighbor. Our bilateral communication
channels are open. But our security, as for every friendly country,
should be based on the principle of respect under international law.
It’s normal to protect our national airspace,” Davutoğlu said,
addressing party members in parliament.
And it is normal for Russia to defend its ally Syria. Against all
enemies. By all means.
But back to Turkey's motive. The way this is played one might believe
that this was a indeed a lonely Turkish idea to defend its immediate
interests in Syria - the "Turkmen" as well as the oil business Erdogan's
son has with the Islamic State.
But there is also a bigger game going on and it is likely that Erdogan
has a new contract and Obama's backing for this escalation. James
Winnefeld, the deputy chief of General Staff of the U.S. military, was
in Ankara when the incident happened. The cooperation between U.S. and
Turkish military and especially the air forces is quite tight. It is
hard to believe that there was no communication about what was prepared
to happen.
After the Islamic State attack in France President Hollande attempted to
create a global coalition against IS which would include Russia and Iran
as well as the U.S. led anti-ISIS block. But such a coalition, which
makes a lot of sense, would have to agree to leave Syria alone and to
help Syrian ground forces to effectively fight the Islamic State. It
does not make sense to destroy the Syrian state and to just hope that
the outcome would be something better than an emboldened IS or AlQaeda
ruling in Damascus. That outcome is certainly not in Europe's interest.
But a global coalition is not in U.S. or Turkish interests. It would end
their common plans and efforts to overthrow the Syrian government and to
install a "Sunni" state in Syria and Iraq as a Turkish protectorate.
The Russian jet incident decreased the likelihood of such a coalition.
Holland, visiting Washington yesterday, had to pull back with his plan
and was again degraded to parrot Obama's "Assad must go" nonsense. Obama
feels emboldened and now pushes to widen the conflict in Syria:
    The Obama administration is using the current moment of extreme
anger and anxiety in Europe to press allies for sharp increases in their
contributions to the fight against the Islamic State. Suggestions
include more strike aircraft, more intelligence-sharing, more training
and equipment for local fighters, and deployment of their own special
operations ­forces.
    ...
    While new contributions would be added to anti-Islamic State
campaigns across the board, the attention is clearly on Syria, marking a
shift in what began as an “Iraq first” focus when Obama authorized
airstrikes in the region last fall.
    ...
    Obama, speaking beside Hollande on Tuesday, restated his insistence
that Assad is part of the problem, not the solution, and that he must go.
The Obama administration is also preparing to install the Turkish dream
of a "safe zone" between Aleppo and the Turkish border north of it.
    Among several coalition priorities in Syria, the United States has
begun a series of airstrikes in an area known as the “Mar’a line,” named
for a town north of Aleppo in the northwest. There, a 60-mile stretch to
the Euphrates River in the east is the only remaining part of the
Syria-Turkey border under Islamic State control.
    The administration had delayed beginning operations in the area
because U.S. aircraft were needed in operations farther east, and it has
been uncertain that local opposition forces­ would be able to hold the
territory if it could be cleared with airstrikes.
The increased Russian air defense and the likely increase of its
deployed planes will make those "safe zone" plans impossible.
But Obama, in my conclusion, still wants to drag NATO into Syria and
wants to assemble enough forces "against ISIS" to be able to overwhelm
the Syrian government and its Russian protectors. If that does not work
he at least hopes to give Russia the Afghanistan like "quagmire" in
Syria he and other U.S. officials promised. The again increasing
tensions with U.S. proxy Ukraine only help in that regard.
But there is even more to that plan. Just by chance (not) the NYT op-ed
pages launch a trial balloon today for the creation of a Sunni state in
east Syria and west Iraq. But that (Islamic) State is already there and
the "containment" strategy Obama practices towards it guarantees that it
will fester.
Obama continues his immensely destructive policies in the Middle East
with zero regard to the all the bad outcomes these are likely to have
for the people there as well as for Europe. One again wonders if all
these action follow from sheer incompetence or from some devilish,
ingenious strategic planning.

Thought I'd throw this out there...
The Archdruid Report
Druid perspectives on nature, culture, and the future of industrial society

The Shadows in the Cave
I had intended this week’s post to be the next episode in the Retrotopia
narrative, chronicling Peter Carr’s meeting with the irrepressible Col.
Tom Pappas of the Lakeland Republic Army, and the trip out to Defiance
County for the annual drone shoot, but that will have to wait another
week. No, I haven’t decided to comment instead on the recent spate of
terror attacks in France.  As people in a variety of other corners of
the world have pointed out, identical outrages happen all over the Third
World every few days.  The only reason this latest horror has gotten so
much air time is that it affected people in one of the world’s
privileged countries instead.
Nor am I going to be devoting this week’s post to the latest, extremely
troubling round of news from the climate change front—though that’s
going to get a post to itself down the road a bit, when I’ve had time to
do a little more research. That’s a far bigger story than the terror
attacks in Paris, though of course it’s not getting anything like as
much attention in the media.  From the beginning of serious salt water
infiltration into South Florida’s aquifers, through ominously bulging
sediments in Arctic Ocean shallows, to an assortment of truly
frightening data points from Greenland, it’s clear that we’ve passed the
threshold from “something may happen someday” to “something is happening
now”—a transition that probably has quite a bit to do with the
increasingly shrill tone of climate-change denialist rhetoric just now,
and even more to do with the increasingly plaintive tone of those
activists who still insist that everything can be fixed if we all just
join hands and sing “Kum ba ya” one more time.
No, this week’s post is going to explore a topic that’s far less
important in the overall scheme of things, though it’s not without its
relevance to the crisis of our age. I want to talk about the reaction I
fielded in response to last week’s post here on The Archdruid Report,
which was an exploration of our culture’s taboo against choosing not to
use the latest technologies.
I expected that post to field its share of outraged denunciations, and
it certainly did. What I didn’t expect was that it would receive more
comments than any other post in the history of The Archdruid Report, and
the vast majority of those comments would agree heartily with the two
points of that post. The first of these points is that there’s a
significant number of Americans out there who, for one good reason or
another, choose not to use cell phones, televisions, automobiles,
microwave ovens, and an assortment of other currently fashionable
technologies. The second is that there’s an even larger number of
Americans out there who get really, really freaky about people who make
such choices.
Some of the stories I heard from readers of my blog were absolute
classics of the type. There was the couple who don’t enjoy television
and so don’t own one, and had a relative ask them every single year,
over and over again, if she could buy them a television for Christmas. They said no thank you every single year, and finally she went out and
bought them a television anyway because she just couldn’t stand the
thought that they weren’t watching one. There was the coworker who
plopped a laptop playing some sitcom or other right down on the lap of
one of my readers and demanded that the reader watch it, right then and
there, so that they would have something to talk about. There was the
person who, offended by another reader’s lack of interest in television,
finally shouted, “You must be living in a dream world!” Er, which of
these people was spending four to six hours a day watching paid actors
playing imaginary characters act out fictional events in contrived settings?
Televisions were far from the only focus of this sort of technobullying.
Other readers reported getting similar reactions from other people
because they didn’t happen to have, and weren’t interested in having,
microwave ovens, smartphones, and so on down the list of currently
fashionable trinkets. The stories are really quite eye-opening, and not
in a good way. Forget about all the popular cant that insists that
you’re free in the USA to make your own choices and have whatever
lifestyle you want.  According to a significant fraction of
Americans—and to judge from what my readers reported, that fraction
isn’t limited to any one class, income level, or region of the
country—the only freedom you’re supposed to exercise, when it comes to
technology, is that of choosing which brand label will be slapped on
each item in the officially approved list of devices you’re expected to own.
The prevalence of technobullying and technoshaming in today’s America is
a fascinating point, and one we’ll explore in a few moments, with the
able assistance of the denunciations flung at last week’s post by the
minority of readers who reacted that way. What I want to consider first
is the fact that so many people responded to last week’s post so
positively. One blog in an uncrowded corner of the internet, written by
an author whose day job as an archdruid locates him squarely on the
outer fringes of contemporary American life, is very nearly the opposite
of a statistically valid poll. Still, the sheer volume of the response
makes me suspect that something significant is going on here.
By that I don’t mean that there’s some sort of groundswell of
renunciation, leading people to walk away from technologies in the same
spirit that led medieval ascetics to don hair shirts and flog themselves
for the good of their souls. That’s one of the common stereotypes
directed at those of us who aren’t interested in the latest technotrash,
and it completely misses what’s actually going on. I’ll use myself as an
example here. I don’t own a television—I haven’t owned one in my adult
life—and it’s not because I have some moral or political objection to
televisions, or because I’m into self-denial, or what have you. I don’t
own a television because I find watching television about as enticing as
eating a bowl of warm snot.
It’s not the programming, either—that’s another of the standard
stereotypes, that the only thing one can find objectionable about
television is the programming, and it’s as inaccurate as the rest.  To
me, quite simply, the activity of watching little colored shapes jerk
around on a screen is boring and irritating, not relaxing and enjoyable,
no matter what the little colored shapes are supposed to be doing. Yes,
I grew up with a television in the house.  I experienced plenty of it
back in the day, and I have zero interest in experiencing any more,
because I don’t like it. It really is that simple. It’s that simple for
others as well: they don’t find this or that technology enjoyable,
useful, or relevant to their lifestyles, and so they’ve chosen to do
something else with their money and time. Shouldn’t so simple and
personal a choice be their own business, and nobody else’s?
To judge by the reactions that those who make such choices routinely
field, apparently not. The pushbacks discussed in the comments page last
week range from the sort of in-your-face confrontations discussed above
to a much-forwarded article in I forget which online rag, where somebody
was airily announcing that he wasn’t interested in being friends with
somebody unless he could text some vacuous comment about lunch to the
other person at 2:15 and get a response by 2:30. (My readers and I are
good with that—somebody who insists on getting immediate feedback for
their random outbursts of mental flatulence isn’t somebody we want as a
friend, either.) Then there were the indignant responses to last week’s
post, which belong in a category by themselves.
I’m sorry to say that my favorite diatribe didn’t show up in the comment
queue for The Archdruid Report. It appeared instead on one of the many
other websites that carry my weekly posts, and it insisted, among
several other less juicy bits, that my lack of enthusiasm for television
obviously meant that I was conspiring to deprive everyone else of their
teevees. You’ve got to admit that for sheer giddy delirium, that one’s
hard to beat. By the same logic, if I dislike peanuts—as in fact I do—I
must be committed to some kind of anti-peanut crusade devoted to
eradicating the entire species. Not so;  Arachis hypogaea is welcome to
live and thrive, for all I care, and my fellow hominids are equally
welcome to eat as much of its produce as they happen to desire.  In
fact, they can divide my share among them. The only thing I ask in
return is that nobody expect me to eat the things myself.
The same rule applies equally to television, as it does to a great many
other things. Like most human beings, I enjoy some things and don’t
enjoy others, and in the vast majority of these cases, nobody feels
particularly threatened by the fact that I don’t like something they do,
and avoid it for that sensible reason. For this one commenter, at least,
that obviously wasn’t the case, and it’s worth reflecting on the vast
personal insecurities that must have driven such a bizarre reaction.
Still, that was one of a kind, so we’ll pass on to the others.
A theme that showed up rather more often in the hate mail responding to
last week’s post was the insistence that if I don’t have a television, a
microwave, or a cell phone, I’m a hypocrite if I have an internet
connection. I encourage my readers to think about that claim for a
moment. I suppose a case could be made that if my lack of interest in
having a television, a microwave, or a cell phone was motivated by the
kind of passion for hair-shirt asceticism mentioned above, and I had an
internet connection, I could be accused of the kind of slacking that
used to get you thrown out of the really top-notch hermitages. From any
other perspective, it’s a triumph of absurdity. If people are in fact
allowed to choose, from among the currently available technologies,
those that make them happiest—as the cheerleaders of the consumer
economy delight to insist—what could possibly be wrong with choosing
some old technologies and some newer ones, if that’s the mix you prefer?
Then there are the people whose response to the technology of an older
time is to yammer endlessly about whatever bad things happened in those
days, even when the bad things in question had nothing to do with the
technology and vice versa. People like the couple I discussed in last
week’s post, who prefer Victorian furnishings and clothing to their
modern equivalents, get this sort of bizarre non sequitur all the time,
but variants of it turned up in my inbox last week as well. Here again,
there’s some heavy-duty illogic involved. If a technology that was
invented and used in the 1850s, say, is permanently tarred with the
various social evils of that era, and ought to be rejected because those
evils happened, wouldn’t that also mean that the internet is just as
indelibly tarred with the social evils of the modern era, and ought to
be discarded because bad things are happening in the world today? What’s
sauce for the goose, after all, is sauce for the gander...
Finally, there’s the capstone of the whole edifice of unreason, the
insistence that anybody who doesn’t use the latest, hottest technotrash
wants to go “back to the caves,” or to even take all of humanity to that
much-denounced destination. “The caves” have a bizarre gravitational
effect on the imagination of a certain class of modern thinkers. Everything that’s not part of the latest assortment of glitzy
technogimmicks, in their minds, somehow morphs into the bearskin kilts
and wooden clubs that so many of us still, despite well over a century
of detailed archeological evidence, insist on pushing onto our
prehistoric ancestors.
When people of this kind archly dismiss people like the Chrismans, the
neo-Victorian couple just mentioned, as going “back to the caves,”
they’re engaged in a very interesting kind of absurdity. Do cavemen and
Victorians belong on the same level? Sure, cavemen had flush toilets and
central heating, daily newspapers and public libraries, not to mention
factories, railways, global maritime trade, a telegraph network covering
much of the planet’s land surface, and a great deal more of the same
kind! That’s absurd, of course. It’s even more absurd to insist that
people who simply don’t enjoy using this or that technology, and so
don’t use it, are going back to “the caves”—but I can promise you, dear
reader, from my own personal experience, that if you show a lack of
interest in any piece of fashionable technology, you’ll have this phrase
thrown at you.
That happens because “the caves” aren’t real. They aren’t, for example,
the actual cave-shrines of the Magdalenian people who lived fifteen
thousand years ago, whose lifestyles were quite similar to those of
Native Americans before Columbus, and who used to go deep into the caves
of Europe to paint sacred images that still stun the viewer today by
their beauty and artistry. “The caves” of contemporary rhetoric, rather,
are thoughtstopping abstractions, bits of verbal noise that people have
been taught to use so they don’t ask inconvenient questions about where
this thing called “progress” is taking us and whether any sane person
would actually want to go there. Flattening out the entire complex
richness of the human past into a single cardboard bogeyman labeled “the
caves” is one way to do that.  So is papering over the distinctly ugly
future we’re making for ourselves with a screen shot or two from a
Jetsons cartoon and a gaudy banner saying “We’re headed for the stars!”
It’s really rather fascinating, all things considered, that the image of
the cave should have been picked up for that dubious purpose. Not that
long ago, most literate people in the Western world tended to have a
very different image come to mind when someone mentioned caves. That was
courtesy of a man named Aristocles of Athens, who lived a little more
than 2300 years ago and whose very broad shoulders got him the nickname
Plato. In the longest, most influential, and most problematic of his
works, usually called The Republic—a bad choice, as this word nowadays
has connotations of rights under law that the Greek title Politeia
lacks—he framed his discussion of the gap between perception and reality
with an arresting image.
Imagine, Plato says, that we are all shackled in a cave, unable to turn
our heads to either side. All we can see are dark shapes that move this
way and that on the flat wall of the cave in front of us. Those dark
shapes are all we know.  They are our reality.
Now imagine that one of these prisoners manages to get loose from his
shackles, and turns away from the cave wall and the dark shapes on it.
He’s in for a shock, because what he sees when he turns around is a
bonfire, and people moving objects in front of the flames so that the
objects cast shadows on the cave wall. Everything he thought was reality
is simply a shadow cast by these moving objects.
If the prisoner who’s gotten loose pays attention, furthermore, he might
just notice that the cave isn’t limited to the bonfire, the prisoners,
the objects casting the shadows and the people who manipulate those
objects. Off past the bonfire, on one side of the cave, the floor slopes
upwards, and in the distance is a faint light that doesn’t seem to come
from the fire If our escaped prisoner is brave enough, he might
decide to go investigate that light. As he does so, the bonfire and the
shadows slip into the darkness behind him, and the light ahead grows
brighter and clearer.
Then, if he’s brave enough and keeps going, he steps out of the cave and
into the sunlight. That’s not an easy thing, either, because the light
is so much more intense than the dim red glow in the cave that for a
while, he can’t see a thing. He stumbles, rubs his eyes, tries to find
his bearings, and discovers that the detailed knowledge he had of the
way shadows moved on the cave wall won’t help him at all in this new,
blazingly bright realm. He has to discard everything he thinks he knows,
and learn the rules of an unfamiliar world.
Bit by bit, though, he accomplishes this. His eyes adapt to the
sunlight, he learns to recognize objects and to sense things—color, for
example, and depth—which didn’t exist in the shadow-world he thought he
inhabited when he was still a prisoner in the cave. Eventually he can
even see the sun, and know where the light that illumines the real world
actually comes from.
Now, Plato says, imagine that he decides to go back into the cave to
tell the remaining prisoners what he’s seen. To begin with, it’s going
to be rough going, because his eyes have adapted to the brilliant
daylight and so he’s going to trip and stumble on the way down. Once he
gets there, anything he says to the prisoners is going to be dismissed
as the most consummate rubbish:  what is this nonsense about color and
depth, and a big bright glowing thing that crosses something called the
sky? What’s more, the people to whom he’s addressing his words are going
to misunderstand them, thinking that they’re about the shadow-world in
front of their eyes—after all, that’s the only reality they know—and
they’re going to decide that he must be an idiot because nothing he says
has anything to do with the shadow-world.
Plato didn’t mention that the prisoners might respond by trying to drag
the escapee back into line with them and bully him into putting his
shackles back on, though that’s generally the way such things work out
in practice. Plato also never saw a television, which is unfortunate in
a way—if he had, he could have skipped the complicated setup with the
bonfire and the people waving around objects that cast shadows, and
simply said, “Imagine that we’re all watching television in a dark room.”
Now of course Plato had his own reasons for using the cave metaphor, and
developed it in directions that aren’t relevant to this week’s post. The
point I want to make here is that every technology is a filter that
shapes the way we experience and interact with the world. In some cases,
such as television, the filtering effect is so drastic it’s hard not to
see—unless, that is, you don’t want to see it.  In other cases, it’s
subtle. There are valid reasons people might want to use one filter
rather than another, or to set aside an assortment of filters in order
to get a clearer view of some part of the world or their lives.
There are also, as already noted, matters of personal choice. Some of us
prefer sun and wind and depth and color to the play of shadows on the
walls of the cave. That doesn’t mean that we’re going to drag those who
don’t share that preference out into the blinding light, or that we’re
going to turn ourselves into the Throg the Cave Man shadow that’s being
waved around so enthusiastically on one corner of the cave wall. It does
mean—or so the response to last week’s post suggests—that a significant
number of people are losing interest in the shadow-play and clambering
up the awkward but rewarding journey into the sunlight and the clean
cool air, and it may just mean as well that those who try to bully them
into staying put and staring at shadows may have less success than they
On an entirely personal note, I’m pleased to report that Founders House

Without regulation you OWN your OWN 'monopoly' in whatever you
accumulate and so does everyone else.
The Hunts cornered the silver market in a REGULATED market, which, for
economic reasons better left to others to explain, cause the price of
silver to decline dramatically and then stabilize and stay at that level
for years .
In a free market they'd just be sitting on a bunch of silver they
couldn't sell and anyone else with silver would go on trading with
others on a more equilateral basis.
Of course I'm making the assumption that really free markets can only
exist in fully decentralized societies that would eschew centralized

them. People that want to profit over other people need them, but
individuals do not have to cooperate ... until the middlemen conspire
with 'People that want to profit over other people" to hire people with
guns to enforce their markets.
But then, I don't really understand. Help me out here. Where, then, are the middlemen? How does your remove them?

The Russians have no person like that. They use their foreign policy

person) is a Kleptocrat and generally want to destroy the Russian
government, not assist it.
Example of what Porter Goss meant:
Right now the US is making claims via the Daily Beast that the Russians
bombed a hospital in al-Nusra/ISIS HQ Idlib Syria.
The US government is making NO CLAIM AT ALL. They're leaving it to the
Western NGO backed hospital's staff and a guy whose CV is:
You know what the "Sons of Iraq program" was rysiek?
It was the publicly announced US attempt in Iraq to get al-Qaeda
affiliated Sunnis to work as militias for the government, paid for by
the US. The 'paymasters' were a little slow so most of them, much like
the ISIS fighters in Idlib, of whom some most likely are those former
'sons', 'defected to al-Qaeda, and the guy mentioned above is a LONG
TERM "Handler" for those folks as propaganda intermediary for the
"Syrian Coalition", western governments, working for a PRIVATE NGO with
no direct affiliation anymore to the CIA or Pentagon.
PS. George Soros is only 4 degrees separated from al-Qaeda.
He funds the "White Helmets" in Syria, the "Free Syrian Army's"
fighter(1) SAR team that OCCASIONALLY rescues a civilian. Those FSA
fighters defect to al-Nusra. 70 just did so and stated that was their
intent from the git (2). al-Nusra swears allegiance to ISIS (3), and
ISIS was formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq.(4)
All the above has happened without one US dollar going through
government channels (except the publicly known funding to train the
defecting fighters).

Unless it was something indispensable, they'd be sitting on something
worthless. That's why, until the industrial age, almost all wars were
over WATER rights., Not extractive resource rights (currently thinking
of DRC, pretty much the sole source for the tantalum for your
smartphone's touchy-feelie screen and micro-capacitors)
By extension, cornering the market in silver, or tantalum, or any
industrially-used extractive resource brings the industrial age one step
closer to extinction (snigger...)
Before nation-states and city states it was most likely THE way of life
for humans ... Until the industrial revolution it still existed in many
tribal-based hunter-gatherer and agrarian cultures.
Even today the Zapatistas have a slogan that spells out the cultural
"Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves"
Communities based on getting for oneself so one can 'give' to others is
sickness. In healthy cultures one works for the community so the fruits
of one's labor comes to all who participate.
W. Edward Deming knew that was the way things should work, and so does
every industrialist on the planet. But it doesn't maximize THEIR profit.

The market is, in the instance you used, a microscopic subset of
humanity. The 1 percent or typically less who buy armies and guns. OPEC
could never have existed without US and UK's naval demand for oil after
WWI (because of the higher BTUs available per load than coal) and the
strongmen those governments assisted to power to obtain the oil.
Read the first chapter of "End of Oil" by Paul Roberts. He manages to
give a history of the Middle East from the time the first barrel of oil
was shipped from a Saudi oil terminal in the mid 1910s to the invasion
of Iraq in a very concise manner.
Ps. Norway and Venezuela are also members of OPEC, and are standing by
to shift the internal balance of the organization entirely to the West
if the illiterate "House of Saud" and it's perverted 'princes' are ever

@_subject: Surveillance... Beware the Weather Blimps 
From the Sun article:
Yeah: " a number of procedures and systems in place"... which begs the
question how much does it cost to scramble two f-16s to follow it around
like a cow gone astray?
Houston, we have a problem:
Military Blimp’s Rampage Deflates Raytheon’s Hopes to Sell More
In what may be the most bizarre and public crash of a multi-billion
dollar Pentagon boondoggle ever, a surveillance blimp flying over an
Army base in Maryland broke loose Wednesday afternoon, its 6,000-foot
long tether wreaking havoc on the countryside before it finally came
down in pieces in Pennsylvania.
The giant airship — 80 yards long and about the size of three Goodyear
blimps — was one of a pair that represented the last gasp of an 18-year,
$2.7 billion-dollar program called JLENS or “Joint Land Attack Cruise
Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System.”
There were once supposed to be 36 of them, their high-resolution
360-degree radar coverage up to 340 miles in any direction protecting
the nation from cruise missiles.
But costs inflated, doubts about their utility mounted, and the program
was scaled back and almost killed.
Blimps, it turns out, have had mixed success in purely military terms.
When equipped with cameras, they are highly effective at conducting
surveillance – but the Army promised there were no cameras on the JLENS
What blimps are best at is having a psychological effect: making people
feel like they’re being watched. Filmmaker Kirsten Johnson’s short
documentary The Above touches on that phenomenon. The film, made for The
Intercept‘s Field of Vision project, mostly shows a U.S. military
surveillance balloon floating on a tether high above Kabul, Afghanistan.
But it ends with shots of the JLENS.
Finally, the Army agreed to launch two of them, for a three-year test.
They were hovering at a height of 10,000 feet just off Interstate 95,
about 45 miles northeast of Washington, D.C., and about 20 miles from
Baltimore. In theory, they could track moving objects from North
Carolina to Boston, or an area the size of Texas. With only two in the
air, they effectively cost about $1.4 billion each — a lot, even by
advanced weapons standards.
While the blimps became perhaps the Pentagon’s most visible white
elephants, their manufacturer, the Raytheon Co., still hoped to make
some more money off them.
The huge defense contractor’s endgame, at least until Wednesday, seemed
to be trying to sell them abroad.
In a video interview with Shephard Media just two weeks ago, Douglas
Burgess, director of persistent surveillance programs at Raytheon,
discussed the JLENS program. “There’s a lot of interest internationally,
particularly now that we’re up and flying,” he said. “I can’t talk
specifics about who, but there is certainly a lot of interest
As for his next step? “For us, it’s to get the A+, I call it, on the
scorecard from NORAD about its operational utility here on the East
Coast. So that’s really our near-term focus.”
But that A+ has now most likely turned into something closer to an F.
Then again, JLENS has cheated death before. After a JLENS blimp was
destroyed in a storm in September of 2010, Army officials raised doubts
about the program, attempting to scale it back. That set in motion an
aggressive effort by Raytheon to win over support from Capitol Hill and
the Pentagon.
Raytheon retained the lobbying services of former Sens. John Breaux,
D-La., and Trent Lott, R-Miss., through the firm now known as Squire
Patton Boggs, to press lawmakers on the urgency of the program. TCOM, a
subcontractor for the project, also brought on lobbyists to boost the
blimp, including American Defense International, a D.C. consulting firm.
The company’s officials argued that the JLENS could be used “not just in
combat, but also American cities and towns” as a surveillance tool for
tracking small planes and other domestic threats, according to an
investigation by the Los Angeles Times.
Raytheon, which sponsors regular advertisements in the Beltway Metro
system and is a prominent sponsor of think tanks across the city,
launched a series of promotional videos. Make sure you have the sound up
for this one:
The savior of the JLENS program, according to the Times, was Marine
Corps Gen. James E. “Hoss” Cartwright, then vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. Cartwright argued within the ranks of the military that
the blimp had broad use, despite claims by many that the blimps would
not be much use against the type of crude weapons, such as IEDs, used
against troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Cartwright, after securing support for the blimp, joined Raytheon’s
board, a position that has paid him more than $828,000 in cash and stock.
Among the promotional material Raytheon prepared for JLENS was a FAQ.
One of the questions was “Can the tether break?”
The Raytheon answer: “The chance of that happening is very small because
the tether is made of Vectran and has withstood storms in excess of 100
knots. However, in the unlikely event it does happen, there are a number
of procedures and systems in place which are designed to bring the
aerostat down in a safe manner.”

The Economist
The promise of the blockchain
The trust machine
The technology behind bitcoin could transform how the economy works
Oct 31st 2015 | From the print edition
BITCOIN has a bad reputation. The decentralised digital cryptocurrency,
powered by a vast computer network, is notorious for the wild
fluctuations in its value, the zeal of its supporters and its degenerate
uses, such as extortion, buying drugs and hiring hitmen in the online
bazaars of the “dark net”.
This is unfair. The value of a bitcoin has been pretty stable, at around
$250, for most of this year. Among regulators and financial
institutions, scepticism has given way to enthusiasm (the European Union
recently recognised it as a currency). But most unfair of all is that
bitcoin’s shady image causes people to overlook the extraordinary
potential of the “blockchain”, the technology that underpins it. This
innovation carries a significance stretching far beyond cryptocurrency.
The blockchain lets people who have no particular confidence in each
other collaborate without having to go through a neutral central
authority. Simply put, it is a machine for creating trust.
The blockchain food chain
To understand the power of blockchain systems, and the things they can
do, it is important to distinguish between three things that are
commonly muddled up, namely the bitcoin currency, the specific
blockchain that underpins it and the idea of blockchains in general. A
helpful analogy is with Napster, the pioneering but illegal
“peer-to-peer” file-sharing service that went on line in 1999, providing
free access to millions of music tracks. Napster itself was swiftly shut
down, but it inspired a host of other peer-to-peer services. Many of
these were also used for pirating music and films. Yet despite its
dubious origins, peer-to-peer technology found legitimate uses, powering
internet startups such as Skype (for telephony) and Spotify (for music
streaming)—and also, as it happens, bitcoin.
The blockchain is an even more potent technology. In essence it is a
shared, trusted, public ledger that everyone can inspect, but which no
single user controls. The participants in a blockchain system
collectively keep the ledger up to date: it can be amended only
according to strict rules and by general agreement. Bitcoin’s blockchain
ledger prevents double-spending and keeps track of transactions
continuously. It is what makes possible a currency without a central bank.
Blockchains are also the latest example of the unexpected fruits of
cryptography. Mathematical scrambling is used to boil down an original
piece of information into a code, known as a hash. Any attempt to tamper
with any part of the blockchain is apparent immediately—because the new
hash will not match the old ones. In this way a science that keeps
information secret (vital for encrypting messages and online shopping
and banking) is, paradoxically, also a tool for open dealing.
Bitcoin itself may never be more than a curiosity. However blockchains
have a host of other uses because they meet the need for a trustworthy
record, something vital for transactions of every sort. Dozens of
startups now hope to capitalise on the blockchain technology, either by
doing clever things with the bitcoin blockchain or by creating new
blockchains of their own (see article).
One idea, for example, is to make cheap, tamper-proof public
databases—land registries, say, (Honduras and Greece are interested); or
registers of the ownership of luxury goods or works of art. Documents
can be notarised by embedding information about them into a public
blockchain—and you will no longer need a notary to vouch for them.
Financial-services firms are contemplating using blockchains as a record
of who owns what instead of having a series of internal ledgers. A
trusted private ledger removes the need for reconciling each transaction
with a counterparty, it is fast and it minimises errors. Santander
reckons that it could save banks up to $20 billion a year by 2022.
Twenty-five banks have just joined a blockchain startup, called R3 CEV,
to develop common standards, and NASDAQ is about to start using the
technology to record trading in securities of private companies.
These new blockchains need not work in exactly the way that bitcoin’s
does. Many of them could tweak its model by, for example, finding
alternatives to its energy-intensive “mining” process, which pays
participants newly minted bitcoins in return for providing the computing
power needed to maintain the ledger. A group of vetted participants
within an industry might instead agree to join a private blockchain,
say, that needs less security. Blockchains can also implement business
rules, such as transactions that take place only if two or more parties
endorse them, or if another transaction has been completed first. As
with Napster and peer-to-peer technology, a clever idea is being
modified and improved. In the process, it is fast throwing off its
reputation for shadiness.
New chains on the block
The spread of blockchains is bad for anyone in the “trust business”—the
centralised institutions and bureaucracies, such as banks, clearing
houses and government authorities that are deemed sufficiently
trustworthy to handle transactions. Even as some banks and governments
explore the use of this new technology, others will surely fight it. But
given the decline in trust in governments and banks in recent years, a
way to create more scrutiny and transparency could be no bad thing.
Drawing up regulations for blockchains at this early stage would be a
mistake: the history of peer-to-peer technology suggests that it is
likely to be several years before the technology’s full potential
becomes clear. In the meantime regulators should stay their hands, or
find ways to accommodate new approaches within existing frameworks,
rather than risk stifling a fast-evolving idea with overly prescriptive
The notion of shared public ledgers may not sound revolutionary or sexy.
Neither did double-entry book-keeping or joint-stock companies. Yet,
like them, the blockchain is an apparently mundane process that has the
potential to transform how people and businesses co-operate. Bitcoin
fanatics are enthralled by the libertarian ideal of a pure, digital
currency beyond the reach of any central bank. The real innovation is
not the digital coins themselves, but the trust machine that mints
them—and which promises much more besides.

VICE News Battles Canadian Police Over Right to Protect Journalist's
By Patrick McGuire
October 30, 2015 | 7:00 am
VICE News is fighting an attempt by the RCMP — Canada's federal police
force — to obtain "any notes and all records of communications" between
VICE News reporter, Ben Makuch, and former Calgary
resident-turned-Islamic State (IS) militant, Farah Mohamed Shirdon.
In February of this year, the RCMP entered VICE Media's offices in both
Toronto and Montreal and served Vice Media and Makuch with a production
order. In Canada, a production order is similar to a search warrant.
Up until this week, VICE News was prohibited from reporting on the
RCMP's production order due to a court-ordered sealing order. VICE is
contesting the production and sealing orders in court, on the principles
of protecting any and all sources, protecting freedom of the press, and
to avoid the situation wherein the Canadian news media becomes a
veritable investigative arm of the law.
Makuch has been a full-time journalist at VICE since 2014 and was a
contributor dating back to 2012. He has exclusively reported on the
Canadian military's collaboration with Academi (formerly known as
Blackwater), the rise of the Canadian arms trade, and has closely
followed the activities of known IS militants online. Prior to VICE, he
worked at The Canadian Press.
Makuch's ongoing reporting around IS militants led him to notice a
suspected Canadian member of the IS who was particularly active online:
Farah Mohamed Shirdon.
Makuch was able to contact Shirdon, under one of his online aliases,
through Twitter and KIK Messenger — an instant messaging platform for
smartphones with over 14 million users. Through Makuch's exchanges with
Shirdon, VICE was one of the first organizations in the world to
communicate directly with IS via social media. This provided an
unprecedented view into the intentions and motivations of IS members.
Makuch wrote two articles for VICE based on his communications with
Shirdon, which led to the production order.
In October of last year, just before the tragic Parliament Hill shooting
in Ottawa, Shirdon told Makuch: "Canadians at home shall face the brunt
of the retaliation. If you are in this crusader alliance against Islam
and Muslims you shall see your streets filled with blood Inshaa Allah."
Makuch's reporting on Shirdon also led VICE CEO and founder Shane Smith
to conduct an exclusive Skype interview with Shirdon himself. That
interview was incendiary enough to cause the RCMP to charge Shirdon with
the "commission of an indictable offence for a terrorist group" after
Shirdon warned of an Islamic State attack in New York City.
In conversation with Smith in September 2014, Shirdon claimed "a lot of
brothers" are in New York City "mobilizing right now."
The RCMP has charged Shirdon with five other terrorism-related offenses
in absentia. He is believed to still be living among IS.
"VICE's treatment by the RCMP is completely reprehensible," said Tom
Henheffer, executive director of Canadian Journalists for Free
Expression. "Journalists are not lackies for the police and to use us
that way is a totally unjustifiable violation of free expression and
privacy rights. Going further and slapping a journalism outlet with a
months-long gag order is even more absurd. This is not an effective way
to fight terrorism, this is not how institutions in a free and
democratic society are supposed to behave, and this sets a dangerous
precedent for the free press in Canada that must not be repeated."
VICE News will be in court on Jan. 11 to argue its case against the
Crown, which is representing the RCMP in this matter.
Patrick McGuire is the Head of Content for VICE Canada and a member of
Canadian Journalists for Free Expression.

Right now the US is making claims via the Daily Beast that the Russians
bombed a hospital in al-Nusra/ISIS HQ Idlib Syria.
The US government is making NO CLAIM AT ALL. They're leaving it to the
Western NGO backed hospital's staff and a guy whose CV is:
You know what the "Sons of Iraq program" was rysiek?
It was the publicly announced US attempt in Iraq to get al-Qaeda
affiliated Sunnis to work as militias for the government, paid for by
the US. The 'paymasters' were a little slow so most of them, much like
the ISIS fighters in Idlib, of whom some most likely are those former
'sons', 'defected to al-Qaeda, and the guy mentioned above is a LONG
TERM "Handler" for those folks as propaganda intermediary for the
"Syrian Coalition", western governments, working for a PRIVATE NGO with
no direct affiliation anymore to the CIA or Pentagon.
PS. George Soros is only 4 degrees separated from al-Qaeda.
He funds the "White Helmets" in Syria, the "Free Syrian Army's"
fighter(1) SAR team that OCCASIONALLY rescues a civilian. Those FSA
fighters defect to al-Nusra. 70 just did so and stated that was their
intent from the git (2). al-Nusra swears allegiance to ISIS (3), and
ISIS was formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq.(4)
All the above has happened without one US dollar going through
government channels (except the publicly known funding to train the
defecting fighters).

By extension, cornering the market in silver, or tantalum, or any
industrially-used extractive resource brings the industrial age one step
closer to extinction (snigger...)
Before nation-states and city states it was most likely THE way of life
for humans ... Until the industrial revolution it still existed in many
tribal-based hunter-gatherer and agrarian cultures.
Even today the Zapatistas have a slogan that spells out the cultural

Communities based on getting for oneself so one can 'give' to others is
sickness. In healthy cultures one works for the community so the fruits
of one's labor comes to all who participate.
W. Edward Deming knew that was the way things should work, and so does
every industrialist on the planet. But it doesn't maximize THEIR profit.

WWI (because of the higher BTUs available per load than coal) and the
strongmen those governments assisted to power to obtain the oil.
Read the first chapter of "End of Oil" by Paul Roberts. He manages to
give a history of the Middle East from the time the first barrel of oil
was shipped from a Saudi oil terminal in the mid 1910s to the invasion
of Iraq in a very concise manner.
Ps. Norway and Venezuela are also members of OPEC, and are standing by
to shift the internal balance of the organization entirely to the West

it is exceptionally difficult, short of ordering physical duplicates,

There were no "Purges" in Vietnam.
If you read ANY account of those alleged purges carefully what you'll
discover is the article title says so, and the first paragraph says so,
then the rest of the information is about the Laotian and Cambodian
purges, which could have only happened with America's assistance in
bringing (this will sound familiar) warlords who were willing to collude
with the US to power in those countries.
Don't drink the koolaid about the Vietnam War, and NEVER believe an

Purges" to continue the rationalizations that the US has EVER fought a
'righteous' international war. The pacifist need that belief as well, to

From the Sun article:
Yeah: " a number of procedures and systems in place"... which begs the
question how much does it cost to scramble two f-16s to follow it around
like a cow gone astray?
Houston, we have a problem:
Military Blimp’s Rampage Deflates Raytheon’s Hopes to Sell More
In what may be the most bizarre and public crash of a multi-billion
dollar Pentagon boondoggle ever, a surveillance blimp flying over an
Army base in Maryland broke loose Wednesday afternoon, its 6,000-foot
long tether wreaking havoc on the countryside before it finally came
down in pieces in Pennsylvania.
The giant airship — 80 yards long and about the size of three Goodyear
blimps — was one of a pair that represented the last gasp of an 18-year,
$2.7 billion-dollar program called JLENS or “Joint Land Attack Cruise
Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System.”
There were once supposed to be 36 of them, their high-resolution
360-degree radar coverage up to 340 miles in any direction protecting
the nation from cruise missiles.
But costs inflated, doubts about their utility mounted, and the program
was scaled back and almost killed.
Blimps, it turns out, have had mixed success in purely military terms.
When equipped with cameras, they are highly effective at conducting
surveillance – but the Army promised there were no cameras on the JLENS
What blimps are best at is having a psychological effect: making people
feel like they’re being watched. Filmmaker Kirsten Johnson’s short
documentary The Above touches on that phenomenon. The film, made for The
Intercept‘s Field of Vision project, mostly shows a U.S. military
surveillance balloon floating on a tether high above Kabul, Afghanistan.
But it ends with shots of the JLENS.
Finally, the Army agreed to launch two of them, for a three-year test.
They were hovering at a height of 10,000 feet just off Interstate 95,
about 45 miles northeast of Washington, D.C., and about 20 miles from
Baltimore. In theory, they could track moving objects from North
Carolina to Boston, or an area the size of Texas. With only two in the
air, they effectively cost about $1.4 billion each — a lot, even by
advanced weapons standards.
While the blimps became perhaps the Pentagon’s most visible white
elephants, their manufacturer, the Raytheon Co., still hoped to make
some more money off them.
The huge defense contractor’s endgame, at least until Wednesday, seemed
to be trying to sell them abroad.
In a video interview with Shephard Media just two weeks ago, Douglas
Burgess, director of persistent surveillance programs at Raytheon,
discussed the JLENS program. “There’s a lot of interest internationally,
particularly now that we’re up and flying,” he said. “I can’t talk
specifics about who, but there is certainly a lot of interest
As for his next step? “For us, it’s to get the A+, I call it, on the
scorecard from NORAD about its operational utility here on the East
Coast. So that’s really our near-term focus.”
But that A+ has now most likely turned into something closer to an F.
Then again, JLENS has cheated death before. After a JLENS blimp was
destroyed in a storm in September of 2010, Army officials raised doubts
about the program, attempting to scale it back. That set in motion an
aggressive effort by Raytheon to win over support from Capitol Hill and
the Pentagon.
Raytheon retained the lobbying services of former Sens. John Breaux,
D-La., and Trent Lott, R-Miss., through the firm now known as Squire
Patton Boggs, to press lawmakers on the urgency of the program. TCOM, a
subcontractor for the project, also brought on lobbyists to boost the
blimp, including American Defense International, a D.C. consulting firm.
The company’s officials argued that the JLENS could be used “not just in
combat, but also American cities and towns” as a surveillance tool for
tracking small planes and other domestic threats, according to an
investigation by the Los Angeles Times.
Raytheon, which sponsors regular advertisements in the Beltway Metro
system and is a prominent sponsor of think tanks across the city,
launched a series of promotional videos. Make sure you have the sound up
for this one:
The savior of the JLENS program, according to the Times, was Marine
Corps Gen. James E. “Hoss” Cartwright, then vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. Cartwright argued within the ranks of the military that
the blimp had broad use, despite claims by many that the blimps would
not be much use against the type of crude weapons, such as IEDs, used
against troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Cartwright, after securing support for the blimp, joined Raytheon’s
board, a position that has paid him more than $828,000 in cash and stock.
Among the promotional material Raytheon prepared for JLENS was a FAQ.
One of the questions was “Can the tether break?”
The Raytheon answer: “The chance of that happening is very small because
the tether is made of Vectran and has withstood storms in excess of 100
knots. However, in the unlikely event it does happen, there are a number
of procedures and systems in place which are designed to bring the
aerostat down in a safe manner.”

The Economist
The promise of the blockchain
The trust machine
The technology behind bitcoin could transform how the economy works
Oct 31st 2015 | From the print edition
BITCOIN has a bad reputation. The decentralised digital cryptocurrency,
powered by a vast computer network, is notorious for the wild
fluctuations in its value, the zeal of its supporters and its degenerate
uses, such as extortion, buying drugs and hiring hitmen in the online
bazaars of the “dark net”.
This is unfair. The value of a bitcoin has been pretty stable, at around
$250, for most of this year. Among regulators and financial
institutions, scepticism has given way to enthusiasm (the European Union
recently recognised it as a currency). But most unfair of all is that
bitcoin’s shady image causes people to overlook the extraordinary
potential of the “blockchain”, the technology that underpins it. This
innovation carries a significance stretching far beyond cryptocurrency.
The blockchain lets people who have no particular confidence in each
other collaborate without having to go through a neutral central
authority. Simply put, it is a machine for creating trust.
The blockchain food chain
To understand the power of blockchain systems, and the things they can
do, it is important to distinguish between three things that are
commonly muddled up, namely the bitcoin currency, the specific
blockchain that underpins it and the idea of blockchains in general. A
helpful analogy is with Napster, the pioneering but illegal
“peer-to-peer” file-sharing service that went on line in 1999, providing
free access to millions of music tracks. Napster itself was swiftly shut
down, but it inspired a host of other peer-to-peer services. Many of
these were also used for pirating music and films. Yet despite its
dubious origins, peer-to-peer technology found legitimate uses, powering
internet startups such as Skype (for telephony) and Spotify (for music
streaming)—and also, as it happens, bitcoin.
The blockchain is an even more potent technology. In essence it is a
shared, trusted, public ledger that everyone can inspect, but which no
single user controls. The participants in a blockchain system
collectively keep the ledger up to date: it can be amended only
according to strict rules and by general agreement. Bitcoin’s blockchain
ledger prevents double-spending and keeps track of transactions
continuously. It is what makes possible a currency without a central bank.
Blockchains are also the latest example of the unexpected fruits of
cryptography. Mathematical scrambling is used to boil down an original
piece of information into a code, known as a hash. Any attempt to tamper
with any part of the blockchain is apparent immediately—because the new
hash will not match the old ones. In this way a science that keeps
information secret (vital for encrypting messages and online shopping
and banking) is, paradoxically, also a tool for open dealing.
Bitcoin itself may never be more than a curiosity. However blockchains
have a host of other uses because they meet the need for a trustworthy
record, something vital for transactions of every sort. Dozens of
startups now hope to capitalise on the blockchain technology, either by
doing clever things with the bitcoin blockchain or by creating new
blockchains of their own (see article).
One idea, for example, is to make cheap, tamper-proof public
databases—land registries, say, (Honduras and Greece are interested); or
registers of the ownership of luxury goods or works of art. Documents
can be notarised by embedding information about them into a public
blockchain—and you will no longer need a notary to vouch for them.
Financial-services firms are contemplating using blockchains as a record
of who owns what instead of having a series of internal ledgers. A
trusted private ledger removes the need for reconciling each transaction
with a counterparty, it is fast and it minimises errors. Santander
reckons that it could save banks up to $20 billion a year by 2022.
Twenty-five banks have just joined a blockchain startup, called R3 CEV,
to develop common standards, and NASDAQ is about to start using the
technology to record trading in securities of private companies.
These new blockchains need not work in exactly the way that bitcoin’s
does. Many of them could tweak its model by, for example, finding
alternatives to its energy-intensive “mining” process, which pays
participants newly minted bitcoins in return for providing the computing
power needed to maintain the ledger. A group of vetted participants
within an industry might instead agree to join a private blockchain,
say, that needs less security. Blockchains can also implement business
rules, such as transactions that take place only if two or more parties
endorse them, or if another transaction has been completed first. As
with Napster and peer-to-peer technology, a clever idea is being
modified and improved. In the process, it is fast throwing off its
reputation for shadiness.
New chains on the block
The spread of blockchains is bad for anyone in the “trust business”—the
centralised institutions and bureaucracies, such as banks, clearing
houses and government authorities that are deemed sufficiently
trustworthy to handle transactions. Even as some banks and governments
explore the use of this new technology, others will surely fight it. But
given the decline in trust in governments and banks in recent years, a
way to create more scrutiny and transparency could be no bad thing.
Drawing up regulations for blockchains at this early stage would be a
mistake: the history of peer-to-peer technology suggests that it is
likely to be several years before the technology’s full potential
becomes clear. In the meantime regulators should stay their hands, or
find ways to accommodate new approaches within existing frameworks,
rather than risk stifling a fast-evolving idea with overly prescriptive
The notion of shared public ledgers may not sound revolutionary or sexy.
Neither did double-entry book-keeping or joint-stock companies. Yet,
like them, the blockchain is an apparently mundane process that has the
potential to transform how people and businesses co-operate. Bitcoin
fanatics are enthralled by the libertarian ideal of a pure, digital
currency beyond the reach of any central bank. The real innovation is
not the digital coins themselves, but the trust machine that mints
them—and which promises much more besides.

VICE News Battles Canadian Police Over Right to Protect Journalist's
By Patrick McGuire
October 30, 2015 | 7:00 am
VICE News is fighting an attempt by the RCMP — Canada's federal police
force — to obtain "any notes and all records of communications" between
VICE News reporter, Ben Makuch, and former Calgary
resident-turned-Islamic State (IS) militant, Farah Mohamed Shirdon.
In February of this year, the RCMP entered VICE Media's offices in both
Toronto and Montreal and served Vice Media and Makuch with a production
order. In Canada, a production order is similar to a search warrant.
Up until this week, VICE News was prohibited from reporting on the
RCMP's production order due to a court-ordered sealing order. VICE is
contesting the production and sealing orders in court, on the principles
of protecting any and all sources, protecting freedom of the press, and
to avoid the situation wherein the Canadian news media becomes a
veritable investigative arm of the law.
Makuch has been a full-time journalist at VICE since 2014 and was a
contributor dating back to 2012. He has exclusively reported on the
Canadian military's collaboration with Academi (formerly known as
Blackwater), the rise of the Canadian arms trade, and has closely
followed the activities of known IS militants online. Prior to VICE, he
worked at The Canadian Press.
Makuch's ongoing reporting around IS militants led him to notice a
suspected Canadian member of the IS who was particularly active online:
Farah Mohamed Shirdon.
Makuch was able to contact Shirdon, under one of his online aliases,
through Twitter and KIK Messenger — an instant messaging platform for
smartphones with over 14 million users. Through Makuch's exchanges with
Shirdon, VICE was one of the first organizations in the world to
communicate directly with IS via social media. This provided an
unprecedented view into the intentions and motivations of IS members.
Makuch wrote two articles for VICE based on his communications with
Shirdon, which led to the production order.
In October of last year, just before the tragic Parliament Hill shooting
in Ottawa, Shirdon told Makuch: "Canadians at home shall face the brunt
of the retaliation. If you are in this crusader alliance against Islam

Makuch's reporting on Shirdon also led VICE CEO and founder Shane Smith
to conduct an exclusive Skype interview with Shirdon himself. That
interview was incendiary enough to cause the RCMP to charge Shirdon with
the "commission of an indictable offence for a terrorist group" after
Shirdon warned of an Islamic State attack in New York City.
In conversation with Smith in September 2014, Shirdon claimed "a lot of
brothers" are in New York City "mobilizing right now."
The RCMP has charged Shirdon with five other terrorism-related offenses
in absentia. He is believed to still be living among IS.
"VICE's treatment by the RCMP is completely reprehensible," said Tom
Henheffer, executive director of Canadian Journalists for Free
Expression. "Journalists are not lackies for the police and to use us
that way is a totally unjustifiable violation of free expression and
privacy rights. Going further and slapping a journalism outlet with a
months-long gag order is even more absurd. This is not an effective way
to fight terrorism, this is not how institutions in a free and
democratic society are supposed to behave, and this sets a dangerous
precedent for the free press in Canada that must not be repeated."
VICE News will be in court on Jan. 11 to argue its case against the
Crown, which is representing the RCMP in this matter.

I'd rather be looking at Pentagon logs for US SOGs in Syria. The
sovereign Syrian government is battling a disinformation blitz. Claims
that Russians are bombing hospitals ... without a speck of proof, to
distract from the proven bombing of an MSF hospital by US forces that
KNEW it was a hospital, for example.
The intertubz is very MUCH a part of that war, and since I side with the
Syrian government, if only because the other option looks A LOT like
what NATO did to Libya, and since the only viable avenues Syria has to
prevent the US and other hostile forces from using it's communications
infrastructure as a weapon against it by CIA mercenaries from Chechnya,
Turkey at el, and their western based disinformation operators, would be
destruction of their civilian telecom system, or spy on that system just
like every other fucking country in the world does, with the US leading

government keeping logs.
Everyone else does. EVERYONE.

Without regulation you OWN your OWN 'monopoly' in whatever you
accumulate and so does everyone else.
The Hunts cornered the silver market in a REGULATED market, which, for
economic reasons better left to others to explain, cause the price of
silver to decline dramatically and then stabilize and stay at that level
for years .
In a free market they'd just be sitting on a bunch of silver they
couldn't sell and anyone else with silver would go on trading with
others on a more equilateral basis.
Of course I'm making the assumption that really free markets can only

The Russians have no person like that. They use their foreign policy
channels. Anyone as wealthy as Soros in Russia (if there is such a
person) is a Kleptocrat and generally want to destroy the Russian
government, not assist it.
Example of what Porter Goss meant:
Right now the US is making claims via the Daily Beast that the Russians
bombed a hospital in al-Nusra/ISIS HQ Idlib Syria.
The US government is making NO CLAIM AT ALL. They're leaving it to the
Western NGO backed hospital's staff and a guy whose CV is:
You know what the "Sons of Iraq program" was rysiek?
It was the publicly announced US attempt in Iraq to get al-Qaeda
affiliated Sunnis to work as militias for the government, paid for by
the US. The 'paymasters' were a little slow so most of them, much like
the ISIS fighters in Idlib, of whom some most likely are those former
'sons', 'defected to al-Qaeda, and the guy mentioned above is a LONG
TERM "Handler" for those folks as propaganda intermediary for the
"Syrian Coalition", western governments, working for a PRIVATE NGO with
no direct affiliation anymore to the CIA or Pentagon.
PS. George Soros is only 4 degrees separated from al-Qaeda.
He funds the "White Helmets" in Syria, the "Free Syrian Army's"
fighter(1) SAR team that OCCASIONALLY rescues a civilian. Those FSA
fighters defect to al-Nusra. 70 just did so and stated that was their
intent from the git (2). al-Nusra swears allegiance to ISIS (3), and
ISIS was formerly known as al-Qaeda in Iraq.(4)
All the above has happened without one US dollar going through
government channels (except the publicly known funding to train the
defecting fighters).

Unless it was something indispensable, they'd be sitting on something
worthless. That's why, until the industrial age, almost all wars were
over WATER rights., Not extractive resource rights (currently thinking
of DRC, pretty much the sole source for the tantalum for your
smartphone's touchy-feelie screen and micro-capacitors)
By extension, cornering the market in silver, or tantalum, or any
industrially-used extractive resource brings the industrial age one step
closer to extinction (snigger...)
Before nation-states and city states it was most likely THE way of life
for humans ... Until the industrial revolution it still existed in many
tribal-based hunter-gatherer and agrarian cultures.
Even today the Zapatistas have a slogan that spells out the cultural
"Everything for everyone and nothing for ourselves"
Communities based on getting for oneself so one can 'give' to others is
sickness. In healthy cultures one works for the community so the fruits
of one's labor comes to all who participate.
W. Edward Deming knew that was the way things should work, and so does
every industrialist on the planet. But it doesn't maximize THEIR profit.
Admittedly, like databases, 'scaling' can be a bit of a problem.

strongmen those governments assisted to power to obtain the oil.
Read the first chapter of "End of Oil" by Paul Roberts. He manages to
give a history of the Middle East from the time the first barrel of oil
was shipped from a Saudi oil terminal in the mid 1910s to the invasion
of Iraq in a very concise manner.
Ps. Norway and Venezuela are also members of OPEC, and are standing by
to shift the internal balance of the organization entirely to the West
if the illiterate "House of Saud" and it's perverted 'princes' are ever
driven from power by internal revolt or the nation destabilized to the

Houston, we have a problem:
Military Blimp’s Rampage Deflates Raytheon’s Hopes to Sell More
In what may be the most bizarre and public crash of a multi-billion
dollar Pentagon boondoggle ever, a surveillance blimp flying over an
Army base in Maryland broke loose Wednesday afternoon, its 6,000-foot
long tether wreaking havoc on the countryside before it finally came
down in pieces in Pennsylvania.
The giant airship — 80 yards long and about the size of three Goodyear
blimps — was one of a pair that represented the last gasp of an 18-year,
$2.7 billion-dollar program called JLENS or “Joint Land Attack Cruise
Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor System.”
There were once supposed to be 36 of them, their high-resolution
360-degree radar coverage up to 340 miles in any direction protecting
the nation from cruise missiles.
But costs inflated, doubts about their utility mounted, and the program
was scaled back and almost killed.
Blimps, it turns out, have had mixed success in purely military terms.
When equipped with cameras, they are highly effective at conducting
surveillance – but the Army promised there were no cameras on the JLENS
What blimps are best at is having a psychological effect: making people
feel like they’re being watched. Filmmaker Kirsten Johnson’s short
documentary The Above touches on that phenomenon. The film, made for The
Intercept‘s Field of Vision project, mostly shows a U.S. military
surveillance balloon floating on a tether high above Kabul, Afghanistan.
But it ends with shots of the JLENS.
Finally, the Army agreed to launch two of them, for a three-year test.
They were hovering at a height of 10,000 feet just off Interstate 95,
about 45 miles northeast of Washington, D.C., and about 20 miles from
Baltimore. In theory, they could track moving objects from North
Carolina to Boston, or an area the size of Texas. With only two in the
air, they effectively cost about $1.4 billion each — a lot, even by
advanced weapons standards.
While the blimps became perhaps the Pentagon’s most visible white
elephants, their manufacturer, the Raytheon Co., still hoped to make
some more money off them.
The huge defense contractor’s endgame, at least until Wednesday, seemed
to be trying to sell them abroad.
In a video interview with Shephard Media just two weeks ago, Douglas
Burgess, director of persistent surveillance programs at Raytheon,
discussed the JLENS program. “There’s a lot of interest internationally,
particularly now that we’re up and flying,” he said. “I can’t talk
specifics about who, but there is certainly a lot of interest
As for his next step? “For us, it’s to get the A+, I call it, on the
scorecard from NORAD about its operational utility here on the East
Coast. So that’s really our near-term focus.”
But that A+ has now most likely turned into something closer to an F.
Then again, JLENS has cheated death before. After a JLENS blimp was
destroyed in a storm in September of 2010, Army officials raised doubts
about the program, attempting to scale it back. That set in motion an
aggressive effort by Raytheon to win over support from Capitol Hill and
the Pentagon.
Raytheon retained the lobbying services of former Sens. John Breaux,
D-La., and Trent Lott, R-Miss., through the firm now known as Squire
Patton Boggs, to press lawmakers on the urgency of the program. TCOM, a
subcontractor for the project, also brought on lobbyists to boost the
blimp, including American Defense International, a D.C. consulting firm.
The company’s officials argued that the JLENS could be used “not just in
combat, but also American cities and towns” as a surveillance tool for
tracking small planes and other domestic threats, according to an
investigation by the Los Angeles Times.
Raytheon, which sponsors regular advertisements in the Beltway Metro
system and is a prominent sponsor of think tanks across the city,
launched a series of promotional videos. Make sure you have the sound up
for this one:
The savior of the JLENS program, according to the Times, was Marine
Corps Gen. James E. “Hoss” Cartwright, then vice chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff. Cartwright argued within the ranks of the military that
the blimp had broad use, despite claims by many that the blimps would
not be much use against the type of crude weapons, such as IEDs, used
against troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Cartwright, after securing support for the blimp, joined Raytheon’s
board, a position that has paid him more than $828,000 in cash and stock.
Among the promotional material Raytheon prepared for JLENS was a FAQ.
One of the questions was “Can the tether break?”
The Raytheon answer: “The chance of that happening is very small because
the tether is made of Vectran and has withstood storms in excess of 100
knots. However, in the unlikely event it does happen, there are a number
of procedures and systems in place which are designed to bring the
aerostat down in a safe manner.”

The Economist
The promise of the blockchain
The trust machine
The technology behind bitcoin could transform how the economy works
Oct 31st 2015 | From the print edition
BITCOIN has a bad reputation. The decentralised digital cryptocurrency,
powered by a vast computer network, is notorious for the wild
fluctuations in its value, the zeal of its supporters and its degenerate
uses, such as extortion, buying drugs and hiring hitmen in the online
bazaars of the “dark net”.
This is unfair. The value of a bitcoin has been pretty stable, at around
$250, for most of this year. Among regulators and financial
institutions, scepticism has given way to enthusiasm (the European Union
recently recognised it as a currency). But most unfair of all is that
bitcoin’s shady image causes people to overlook the extraordinary
potential of the “blockchain”, the technology that underpins it. This
innovation carries a significance stretching far beyond cryptocurrency.
The blockchain lets people who have no particular confidence in each
other collaborate without having to go through a neutral central
authority. Simply put, it is a machine for creating trust.
The blockchain food chain
To understand the power of blockchain systems, and the things they can
do, it is important to distinguish between three things that are
commonly muddled up, namely the bitcoin currency, the specific
blockchain that underpins it and the idea of blockchains in general. A
helpful analogy is with Napster, the pioneering but illegal
“peer-to-peer” file-sharing service that went on line in 1999, providing
free access to millions of music tracks. Napster itself was swiftly shut
down, but it inspired a host of other peer-to-peer services. Many of
these were also used for pirating music and films. Yet despite its
dubious origins, peer-to-peer technology found legitimate uses, powering
internet startups such as Skype (for telephony) and Spotify (for music
streaming)—and also, as it happens, bitcoin.
The blockchain is an even more potent technology. In essence it is a
shared, trusted, public ledger that everyone can inspect, but which no
single user controls. The participants in a blockchain system
collectively keep the ledger up to date: it can be amended only
according to strict rules and by general agreement. Bitcoin’s blockchain
ledger prevents double-spending and keeps track of transactions
continuously. It is what makes possible a currency without a central bank.
Blockchains are also the latest example of the unexpected fruits of
cryptography. Mathematical scrambling is used to boil down an original
piece of information into a code, known as a hash. Any attempt to tamper
with any part of the blockchain is apparent immediately—because the new
hash will not match the old ones. In this way a science that keeps
information secret (vital for encrypting messages and online shopping
and banking) is, paradoxically, also a tool for open dealing.
Bitcoin itself may never be more than a curiosity. However blockchains
have a host of other uses because they meet the need for a trustworthy
record, something vital for transactions of every sort. Dozens of
startups now hope to capitalise on the blockchain technology, either by
doing clever things with the bitcoin blockchain or by creating new
blockchains of their own (see article).
One idea, for example, is to make cheap, tamper-proof public
databases—land registries, say, (Honduras and Greece are interested); or
registers of the ownership of luxury goods or works of art. Documents
can be notarised by embedding information about them into a public
blockchain—and you will no longer need a notary to vouch for them.
Financial-services firms are contemplating using blockchains as a record
of who owns what instead of having a series of internal ledgers. A
trusted private ledger removes the need for reconciling each transaction
with a counterparty, it is fast and it minimises errors. Santander
reckons that it could save banks up to $20 billion a year by 2022.
Twenty-five banks have just joined a blockchain startup, called R3 CEV,
to develop common standards, and NASDAQ is about to start using the
technology to record trading in securities of private companies.
These new blockchains need not work in exactly the way that bitcoin’s
does. Many of them could tweak its model by, for example, finding
alternatives to its energy-intensive “mining” process, which pays
participants newly minted bitcoins in return for providing the computing
power needed to maintain the ledger. A group of vetted participants
within an industry might instead agree to join a private blockchain,
say, that needs less security. Blockchains can also implement business
rules, such as transactions that take place only if two or more parties
endorse them, or if another transaction has been completed first. As
with Napster and peer-to-peer technology, a clever idea is being
modified and improved. In the process, it is fast throwing off its
reputation for shadiness.
New chains on the block
The spread of blockchains is bad for anyone in the “trust business”—the
centralised institutions and bureaucracies, such as banks, clearing
houses and government authorities that are deemed sufficiently
trustworthy to handle transactions. Even as some banks and governments
explore the use of this new technology, others will surely fight it. But
given the decline in trust in governments and banks in recent years, a
way to create more scrutiny and transparency could be no bad thing.
Drawing up regulations for blockchains at this early stage would be a
mistake: the history of peer-to-peer technology suggests that it is
likely to be several years before the technology’s full potential
becomes clear. In the meantime regulators should stay their hands, or
find ways to accommodate new approaches within existing frameworks,
rather than risk stifling a fast-evolving idea with overly prescriptive
The notion of shared public ledgers may not sound revolutionary or sexy.
Neither did double-entry book-keeping or joint-stock companies. Yet,
like them, the blockchain is an apparently mundane process that has the
potential to transform how people and businesses co-operate. Bitcoin
fanatics are enthralled by the libertarian ideal of a pure, digital
currency beyond the reach of any central bank. The real innovation is
not the digital coins themselves, but the trust machine that mints
them—and which promises much more besides.

VICE News Battles Canadian Police Over Right to Protect Journalist's
By Patrick McGuire
October 30, 2015 | 7:00 am
VICE News is fighting an attempt by the RCMP — Canada's federal police
force — to obtain "any notes and all records of communications" between
VICE News reporter, Ben Makuch, and former Calgary
resident-turned-Islamic State (IS) militant, Farah Mohamed Shirdon.
In February of this year, the RCMP entered VICE Media's offices in both
Toronto and Montreal and served Vice Media and Makuch with a production
order. In Canada, a production order is similar to a search warrant.
Up until this week, VICE News was prohibited from reporting on the
RCMP's production order due to a court-ordered sealing order. VICE is
contesting the production and sealing orders in court, on the principles
of protecting any and all sources, protecting freedom of the press, and
to avoid the situation wherein the Canadian news media becomes a
veritable investigative arm of the law.
Makuch has been a full-time journalist at VICE since 2014 and was a
contributor dating back to 2012. He has exclusively reported on the
Canadian military's collaboration with Academi (formerly known as
Blackwater), the rise of the Canadian arms trade, and has closely
followed the activities of known IS militants online. Prior to VICE, he
worked at The Canadian Press.
Makuch's ongoing reporting around IS militants led him to notice a
suspected Canadian member of the IS who was particularly active online:
Farah Mohamed Shirdon.
Makuch was able to contact Shirdon, under one of his online aliases,
through Twitter and KIK Messenger — an instant messaging platform for
smartphones with over 14 million users. Through Makuch's exchanges with
Shirdon, VICE was one of the first organizations in the world to
communicate directly with IS via social media. This provided an
unprecedented view into the intentions and motivations of IS members.
Makuch wrote two articles for VICE based on his communications with
Shirdon, which led to the production order.
In October of last year, just before the tragic Parliament Hill shooting
in Ottawa, Shirdon told Makuch: "Canadians at home shall face the brunt
of the retaliation. If you are in this crusader alliance against Islam
and Muslims you shall see your streets filled with blood Inshaa Allah."
Makuch's reporting on Shirdon also led VICE CEO and founder Shane Smith
to conduct an exclusive Skype interview with Shirdon himself. That
interview was incendiary enough to cause the RCMP to charge Shirdon with
the "commission of an indictable offence for a terrorist group" after
Shirdon warned of an Islamic State attack in New York City.
In conversation with Smith in September 2014, Shirdon claimed "a lot of
brothers" are in New York City "mobilizing right now."
The RCMP has charged Shirdon with five other terrorism-related offenses
in absentia. He is believed to still be living among IS.
"VICE's treatment by the RCMP is completely reprehensible," said Tom
Henheffer, executive director of Canadian Journalists for Free
Expression. "Journalists are not lackies for the police and to use us
that way is a totally unjustifiable violation of free expression and
privacy rights. Going further and slapping a journalism outlet with a
months-long gag order is even more absurd. This is not an effective way
to fight terrorism, this is not how institutions in a free and
democratic society are supposed to behave, and this sets a dangerous
precedent for the free press in Canada that must not be repeated."
VICE News will be in court on Jan. 11 to argue its case against the
Crown, which is representing the RCMP in this matter.
Patrick McGuire is the Head of Content for VICE Canada and a member of
Canadian Journalists for Free Expression.

prevent the US and other hostile forces from using it's communications
infrastructure as a weapon against it by CIA mercenaries from Chechnya,
Turkey at el, and their western based disinformation operators, would be
destruction of their civilian telecom system, or spy on that system just

@_subject: Four things to know about presidential hopeful John McAfee 
The Hill say he's a nutjob. I concur. Ate too many DMT-ridden plants or
lizards somewhere .
"Security software pioneer and newly minted presidential candidate John
McAfee has led an unusual life, to put it mildly.
He’s played Russian roulette in front of a reporter to prove a point,
was once a fugitive from the law in Belize and, just last month, was
arrested for an alleged gun violation and driving under the influence.
In keeping with his unconventional style, McAfee’s bid for the White
House, announced this week, will be waged a candidate from his own
“Cyber Party.”
"I have a huge underground following on the web," McAfee told CNN Money.
"I promise you I will win because I have the votes."
On the same day he announced he was running for president, TV network
Spike announced they were planning to air a series next year that “will
be centered around McAfee's first-person interviews and will reveal
unanswered questions about his life ranging from drug-fueled college
days in Virginia, to learning to battle computer viruses early in his
career at Lockheed in the 1980's, to starting McAfee and Associates in
1987, to the 2012 murder investigation in Belize.”
Here are four know about McAfee as he reenters the national spotlight.
He built fortune on antivirus software, then lost it
McAfee made his millions at the anti-virus company that bore his name.
He ultimately cashed out, selling his stake in the firm after taking it
But his fortune took a hit during the 2008 recession. He was worth about
$100 million before the financial crisis, and less than $10 million
after. He said that his losses were exacerbated because much of his
money was tied up in real estate.
“My father always said, 'Real estate, you can't lose in real estate' ...
you know, oddly enough you can,” he told ABC News at the time.
He sold many of his assets, including houses in Hawaii, Colorado and New
Mexico and moved to Belize to develop “natural” antibiotics.
McAfee Associates, the company he founded, was bought by Intel in 2010.
They dropped his name from the brand in 2014.
The Russian roulette story
While McAfee was in Belize, a Wired magazine writer visited his compound
to report a profile. McAfee pulled out a gun during a conversation with
the writer about the Belizean authorities’ interest in his activities.
McAfee put one bullet in the chamber and placed the gun to his head,
according to the profile. “Maybe what happened didn’t actually happen.
Can I do a demonstration?” he asked the writer, who wrote that he tried
to deescalate the situation.
McAfee pulled the trigger repeatedly. Nothing happened.
“I can do this all day long. I can do this a thousand times. Ten
thousand times. Nothing will ever happen,” he said. “Why? Because you
have missed something. You are operating on an assumption about reality
that is wrong.”
The fugitive
In 2012, authorities in Belize investigating the murder of McAfee’s
neighbor, Gregory Faull, were looking to speak with McAfee. He and the
man had had disputes over McAfee’s dogs and the security guards that
watched his property. McAfee told authorities that his dogs had been
poisoned two days before Faull died.
McAfee maintained his innocence and fled the authorities. He said he
thought he would not get a fair hearing in the country. “Things do not
operate here as they do in the States,” he said. “We are living in a
near dictatorship where the legal system is subservient to the cabinet."
His flight from Belize made national headlines and media outlet Vice was
briefly embroiled in a controversy when it appeared as though they had
leaked McAfee’s location accidentally. But after a month on the lam, he
ended up in the capital city of Guatemala.
“I like Guatemala. I think the legal system in Guatemala is superior to
the legal system in Belize," he told CNN at the time. "Guatemala is
close, it is beautiful and most importantly, I enjoy the company of
DUI arrest
After a period of relative quiet, McAfee surfaced again when he was
arrested earlier this year for a gun possession violation and a DUI in
Tennessee. He claimed that while he was impaired, he hadn’t been
drinking alcohol. Instead, he said that a new prescription for Xanax had
impaired his driving.
"Never taken them before,” he told CNBC. “And in fact I was impaired, I
must admit."
He has also been running a company called Future Tense Central. It backs
a range of products and services, one of which is called Autonomous
Armor. The website for the forthcoming product lists several of McAfee’s
accomplishments, before offering a coda.
“Billions of dollars and decades later,” it says. “McAfee is back and at
it again.”

@_subject: Four things to know about presidential hopeful John McAfee 
The Hill say he's a nutjob. I concur. Ate too many DMT-ridden plants or
lizards somewhere .
"Security software pioneer and newly minted presidential candidate John
McAfee has led an unusual life, to put it mildly.
He’s played Russian roulette in front of a reporter to prove a point,
was once a fugitive from the law in Belize and, just last month, was
arrested for an alleged gun violation and driving under the influence.
In keeping with his unconventional style, McAfee’s bid for the White
House, announced this week, will be waged a candidate from his own
“Cyber Party.”
"I have a huge underground following on the web," McAfee told CNN Money.
"I promise you I will win because I have the votes."
On the same day he announced he was running for president, TV network
Spike announced they were planning to air a series next year that “will
be centered around McAfee's first-person interviews and will reveal
unanswered questions about his life ranging from drug-fueled college
days in Virginia, to learning to battle computer viruses early in his
career at Lockheed in the 1980's, to starting McAfee and Associates in
1987, to the 2012 murder investigation in Belize.”
Here are four know about McAfee as he reenters the national spotlight.
He built fortune on antivirus software, then lost it
McAfee made his millions at the anti-virus company that bore his name.
He ultimately cashed out, selling his stake in the firm after taking it
But his fortune took a hit during the 2008 recession. He was worth about
$100 million before the financial crisis, and less than $10 million
after. He said that his losses were exacerbated because much of his
money was tied up in real estate.
“My father always said, 'Real estate, you can't lose in real estate' ...
you know, oddly enough you can,” he told ABC News at the time.
He sold many of his assets, including houses in Hawaii, Colorado and New
Mexico and moved to Belize to develop “natural” antibiotics.
McAfee Associates, the company he founded, was bought by Intel in 2010.
They dropped his name from the brand in 2014.
The Russian roulette story
While McAfee was in Belize, a Wired magazine writer visited his compound
to report a profile. McAfee pulled out a gun during a conversation with
the writer about the Belizean authorities’ interest in his activities.
McAfee put one bullet in the chamber and placed the gun to his head,
according to the profile. “Maybe what happened didn’t actually happen.
Can I do a demonstration?” he asked the writer, who wrote that he tried
to deescalate the situation.
McAfee pulled the trigger repeatedly. Nothing happened.
“I can do this all day long. I can do this a thousand times. Ten
thousand times. Nothing will ever happen,” he said. “Why? Because you
have missed something. You are operating on an assumption about reality
that is wrong.”
The fugitive
In 2012, authorities in Belize investigating the murder of McAfee’s
neighbor, Gregory Faull, were looking to speak with McAfee. He and the
man had had disputes over McAfee’s dogs and the security guards that
watched his property. McAfee told authorities that his dogs had been
poisoned two days before Faull died.
McAfee maintained his innocence and fled the authorities. He said he
thought he would not get a fair hearing in the country. “Things do not
operate here as they do in the States,” he said. “We are living in a
near dictatorship where the legal system is subservient to the cabinet."
His flight from Belize made national headlines and media outlet Vice was
briefly embroiled in a controversy when it appeared as though they had
leaked McAfee’s location accidentally. But after a month on the lam, he
ended up in the capital city of Guatemala.
“I like Guatemala. I think the legal system in Guatemala is superior to
the legal system in Belize," he told CNN at the time. "Guatemala is
close, it is beautiful and most importantly, I enjoy the company of
DUI arrest
After a period of relative quiet, McAfee surfaced again when he was
arrested earlier this year for a gun possession violation and a DUI in
Tennessee. He claimed that while he was impaired, he hadn’t been
drinking alcohol. Instead, he said that a new prescription for Xanax had
impaired his driving.
"Never taken them before,” he told CNBC. “And in fact I was impaired, I
must admit."
He has also been running a company called Future Tense Central. It backs
a range of products and services, one of which is called Autonomous
Armor. The website for the forthcoming product lists several of McAfee’s
accomplishments, before offering a coda.
“Billions of dollars and decades later,” it says. “McAfee is back and at
it again.”

I wouldn't trust IT either. If you try logging into Hushmail using Tor

stalking Tor for the surveillance state apparatus?
My guess would be that's probably one of their pet surveillance projects.
I understand that a site like fpress undoubtedly needs dDos prevention
services but there has to be some other company providing that sort of
service that isn't connected like a Siamese twin at the wrists and
ankles to the surveillance state.
As a tweet from my account that I don't consider a troll:
I believe NoScript does this as an add-on. It can blacklist cloudflare
but some useful web services such as WeatherUnderground Weather are
badly affected, so fully blocking them limits the utility of the web. Id
say if one only allowed CF for services like that and never showed their
IP to cloudflare otherwise, it wouldn't give them much useful info about
My posts tagged cloudflare

repetitiveness to the info but this one's a good place to start, with

BTW, Yasha Levine hooked me up with the CEO of cloudflare on Twitter one

Domain: freedom.press
IP Address: 108.162.200.15
ISP: CloudFlare
Region: San Francisco (US)
I wouldn't trust cloudflare to wipe my balls and they seem to be the ISP
for freedomDOTpress
I wouldn't trust IT either. If you try logging into Hushmail using Tor
the security question overlay is hosted by... Cloudflare (but not the
rest of Hushmail). Would you suppose CF HAS a vested interest in
stalking Tor for the surveillance state apparatus?
My guess would be that's probably one of their pet surveillance projects.
I understand that a site like fpress undoubtedly needs dDos prevention
services but there has to be some other company providing that sort of
service that isn't connected like a Siamese twin at the wrists and
ankles to the surveillance state.
As a tweet from my account that I don't consider a troll:
I believe NoScript does this as an add-on. It can blacklist cloudflare
but some useful web services such as WeatherUnderground Weather are
badly affected, so fully blocking them limits the utility of the web. Id
say if one only allowed CF for services like that and never showed their
IP to cloudflare otherwise, it wouldn't give them much useful info about
My posts tagged cloudflare
. There's a certain
repetitiveness to the info but this one's a good place to start, with
links to the other related posts >>
BTW, Yasha Levine hooked me up with the CEO of cloudflare on Twitter one
day for a short hostile 'interview' when I questioned Cloudflare's
hosting of BB's Project PM. If you can't stomach weasel words I'd avoid
reading it.

"The  Panama Papers are the exact kind of weaponized Psyops posing as an

    Put on your Panama hat and dance the leak.
    And if you believe in the integrity of the "International Consortium

    I never was, and never will be, a member of this racket; well,

    The ICIJ gets its cash and its "organizational procedure" via the
    Exceptionalistan-based Center for Public Integrity. The money comes
    from: Ford Foundation, Carnegie Endowment, Rockefeller Faimly Fund,
    Kellogg Foundation and the Soros racket.
    This alleged most massive leak ever was obtained by - what else - US
    intel.
    But the REAL leak will never be known. Even the uber-pathetic
    Grauniad admitted, on the record, that "much of the leaked material
    will remain private".
    Why? Because it DIRECTLY implicates a gaggle of Western

From February this year:
    Website-Targeted False Content Injection by Network Operators
    Gabi Nakibly1,3, Jaime Schcolnik2, and Yossi Rubin3
    1 Computer Science Department, Technion, Haifa, Israel
    2Computer Science Department, Interdisciplinary Center, Herzliya,
    Israel
    3Rafael – Advanced Defense Systems, Haifa, Israel
    Over the last few years there have been numerous reports of ISPs
    that alter or proxy their customers’ traffic, including, for
    example, CMA Communications in 2013 [6], Comcast in 2012 [16],
    Mediacom in 2011 [9], WOW! in 2008 [27], and Rogers in 2007 [32].
    Moreover, several extensive studies have brought the details of this
    practice to light [17, 30, 25, 35]. The main motivations of ISPs to
    alter traffic are to facilitate caching, inject advertisements into
    DNS and HTTP error messages, and compress or transcode content.
     All of these reports and studies found that these traffic
    alterations were carried out exclusively by edge ISPs,namely, retail
    ISPs that sell Internet access directly to end customers, and are
    their “first hop” to the Internet. This finding stems from the
    server-centric approach the above studies have taken. In this
    approach, one or a handful of servers are deployed to deliver
    specific content to users, after which a large number of clients are
    solicited to fetch that content from the servers. Finally, an agent
    on the clients – usually a JavaScript delivered by the server itself
    – looks for deviations between the content delivered by the server
    and that displayed to the user. Figure 1(a)illustrates the traffic
    monitored in this server-centric approach.
    Such an approach can be used to inspect the traffic of many clients
    from diverse geographies who are served by different edge ISPs. The
    main disadvantage of this approach is that the content fetched by
    the clients is very specific. All clients fetch the same content
    from the same web servers. This allows only the detection of network
    entities that aim to modify all of the Internet traffic1 of a
    predetermined set of users and are generally oblivious to the actual
    content delivered to the user. Such entities indeed tend to be edge
    ISPs that target only the traffic of their customers.
    In this work we show that the above approach misses a substantial
    portion of the on-path entities that modify traffic on the Internet.
    Using extensive observations over a period of several weeks, we
    analyzed petabits of Internet traffic carrying varied content
    delivered by servers having over 1.5 million distinct IP addresses.
    We newly reveal several network operators that modify traffic not
    limited to a specific set of users. Such network operators alter
    Internet traffic on the basis of its content, primarily by the
    website a user visits. The traffic of every Internet user that
    traverses these network operators is susceptible to alteration."

That's nice except, despite vicious rumors to the contrary indoctrinated
in 'Mericans by the mind modification programs they call "Schools",
there was no "American Revolution". Revolutions are based on ideologies.
Greed is not an ideology. Any simple perusal of the Constitution shows
it is about trade relations between the states, and nations, and private
property rights, to the advantage of a microscopic percentage of the
people on the continent at that time, and perhaps moreso now.
The Bill of Rights is for the rest of us, and it was hard fought, almost
causing the Constitution to have never been signed at all when
delegations began following Pennsylvania's lead, and also considered
walking out. ... and ever since those documents were signed the people
who hold power have strengthened THEIR rights (the constitution) and
weakened ours (the so-called Bill of Rights)

Lived in the same Monterey Bay area California town for 40 years. Over
the last ten years or so it's gotten decidedly colder in the winter. It
rarely used to freeze at sea level here (once or twice in a decade or
so) and now it occurs with some regularity... at least three or four
time a year. It also gets warmer. There used to be a couple of 90 degree
days in the summer and the rest more moderate, typically in the upper
60s to upper 70s for most of the season ... Eight years or so ago it
went up to 105f for two days in a row braking every known record. It
gets into the 80s and 90s much more often now. No one has functional air
conditioning here in their homes or cars, and most homes are only
lightly insulated (if at all). Pity the poor commuters stuck in bay area

    Put on your Panama hat and dance the leak.
    And if you believe in the integrity of the "International Consortium
    of Investigative Journalists" (ICIJ), I got a made in Shenzhen
    Panama hat to sell ya.
    I never was, and never will be, a member of this racket; well,
    people asked me, and I'm answering.
    The ICIJ gets its cash and its "organizational procedure" via the
    Exceptionalistan-based Center for Public Integrity. The money comes
    from: Ford Foundation, Carnegie Endowment, Rockefeller Faimly Fund,
    Kellogg Foundation and the Soros racket.
    This alleged most massive leak ever was obtained by - what else - US
    intel.
    But the REAL leak will never be known. Even the uber-pathetic
    Grauniad admitted, on the record, that "much of the leaked material
    will remain private".
    Why? Because it DIRECTLY implicates a gaggle of Western
    0.00000000001% multibillionaires and corporations. All of them play
    the offshore casino game.

From February this year:
    Website-Targeted False Content Injection by Network Operators

    Over the last few years there have been numerous reports of ISPs
    that alter or proxy their customers’ traffic, including, for
    example, CMA Communications in 2013 [6], Comcast in 2012 [16],
    Mediacom in 2011 [9], WOW! in 2008 [27], and Rogers in 2007 [32].
    Moreover, several extensive studies have brought the details of this
    practice to light [17, 30, 25, 35]. The main motivations of ISPs to
    alter traffic are to facilitate caching, inject advertisements into
    DNS and HTTP error messages, and compress or transcode content.
     All of these reports and studies found that these traffic
    alterations were carried out exclusively by edge ISPs,namely, retail
    ISPs that sell Internet access directly to end customers, and are
    their “first hop” to the Internet. This finding stems from the
    server-centric approach the above studies have taken. In this
    approach, one or a handful of servers are deployed to deliver
    specific content to users, after which a large number of clients are
    solicited to fetch that content from the servers. Finally, an agent
    on the clients – usually a JavaScript delivered by the server itself
    – looks for deviations between the content delivered by the server
    and that displayed to the user. Figure 1(a)illustrates the traffic
    monitored in this server-centric approach.
    Such an approach can be used to inspect the traffic of many clients
    from diverse geographies who are served by different edge ISPs. The
    main disadvantage of this approach is that the content fetched by
    the clients is very specific. All clients fetch the same content
    from the same web servers. This allows only the detection of network
    entities that aim to modify all of the Internet traffic1 of a
    predetermined set of users and are generally oblivious to the actual
    content delivered to the user. Such entities indeed tend to be edge
    ISPs that target only the traffic of their customers.
    In this work we show that the above approach misses a substantial
    portion of the on-path entities that modify traffic on the Internet.
    Using extensive observations over a period of several weeks, we
    analyzed petabits of Internet traffic carrying varied content
    delivered by servers having over 1.5 million distinct IP addresses.
    We newly reveal several network operators that modify traffic not
    limited to a specific set of users. Such network operators alter
    Internet traffic on the basis of its content, primarily by the
    website a user visits. The traffic of every Internet user that
    traverses these network operators is susceptible to alteration."

That's nice except, despite vicious rumors to the contrary indoctrinated
in 'Mericans by the mind modification programs they call "Schools",
there was no "American Revolution". Revolutions are based on ideologies.
Greed is not an ideology. Any simple perusal of the Constitution shows
it is about trade relations between the states, and nations, and private
property rights, to the advantage of a microscopic percentage of the
people on the continent at that time, and perhaps moreso now.
The Bill of Rights is for the rest of us, and it was hard fought, almost
causing the Constitution to have never been signed at all when
delegations began following Pennsylvania's lead, and also considered
walking out. ... and ever since those documents were signed the people
who hold power have strengthened THEIR rights (the constitution) and
weakened ours (the so-called Bill of Rights)

Lived in the same Monterey Bay area California town for 40 years. Over
the last ten years or so it's gotten decidedly colder in the winter. It
rarely used to freeze at sea level here (once or twice in a decade or
so) and now it occurs with some regularity... at least three or four
time a year. It also gets warmer. There used to be a couple of 90 degree
days in the summer and the rest more moderate, typically in the upper
60s to upper 70s for most of the season ... Eight years or so ago it
went up to 105f for two days in a row braking every known record. It
gets into the 80s and 90s much more often now. No one has functional air
conditioning here in their homes or cars, and most homes are only
lightly insulated (if at all). Pity the poor commuters stuck in bay area
traffic (not!)
The Climate pundits are saying what are now the extreme temperatures

    on the clients – usually a JavaScript delivered by the server itself
    – looks for deviations between the content delivered by the server
    and that displayed to the user. Figure 1(a)illustrates the traffic
    monitored in this server-centric approach.
    Such an approach can be used to inspect the traffic of many clients
    from diverse geographies who are served by different edge ISPs. The
    main disadvantage of this approach is that the content fetched by
    the clients is very specific. All clients fetch the same content
    from the same web servers. This allows only the detection of network
    entities that aim to modify all of the Internet traffic1 of a
    predetermined set of users and are generally oblivious to the actual
    content delivered to the user. Such entities indeed tend to be edge
    ISPs that target only the traffic of their customers.
    In this work we show that the above approach misses a substantial
    portion of the on-path entities that modify traffic on the Internet.
    Using extensive observations over a period of several weeks, we
    analyzed petabits of Internet traffic carrying varied content
    delivered by servers having over 1.5 million distinct IP addresses.
    We newly reveal several network operators that modify traffic not
    limited to a specific set of users. Such network operators alter
    Internet traffic on the basis of its content, primarily by the
    website a user visits. The traffic of every Internet user that
    traverses these network operators is susceptible to alteration."

That's nice except, despite vicious rumors to the contrary indoctrinated
in 'Mericans by the mind modification programs they call "Schools",
there was no "American Revolution". Revolutions are based on ideologies.
Greed is not an ideology. Any simple perusal of the Constitution shows
it is about trade relations between the states, and nations, and private
property rights, to the advantage of a microscopic percentage of the
people on the continent at that time, and perhaps moreso now.
The Bill of Rights is for the rest of us, and it was hard fought, almost
causing the Constitution to have never been signed at all when
delegations began following Pennsylvania's lead, and also considered
walking out. ... and ever since those documents were signed the people
who hold power have strengthened THEIR rights (the constitution) and
weakened ours (the so-called Bill of Rights)

Lived in the same Monterey Bay area California town for 40 years. Over
the last ten years or so it's gotten decidedly colder in the winter. It
rarely used to freeze at sea level here (once or twice in a decade or
so) and now it occurs with some regularity... at least three or four
time a year. It also gets warmer. There used to be a couple of 90 degree
days in the summer and the rest more moderate, typically in the upper
60s to upper 70s for most of the season ... Eight years or so ago it
went up to 105f for two days in a row braking every known record. It
gets into the 80s and 90s much more often now. No one has functional air
conditioning here in their homes or cars, and most homes are only
lightly insulated (if at all). Pity the poor commuters stuck in bay area

@_subject: Apple at BlackHat: Reopening the "Going Dark" Debate (Lawfare) 
Just over a week ago, at the BlackHat hacker convention in Las Vegas,
Ivan Krstić, Head of Security Engineering and Architecture at Apple gave
a talk entitled “Behind the scenes of iOS Security,” the slides of which
are available here.
It’s a historic talk for a couple of reasons. First, Apple is
traditionally very secretive about how it technically does security on
its devices. Apple also announced its first bug bounty program. So far,
so newsworthy.
But something else happened at that talk. Unbeknownst to the presenter
or anybody in the audience, Apple just reopened the “Going Dark” dispute
between the FBI and the privacy community, and it turned the entire
dispute on its head. In the cold light of day, I suspect Apple, the US
government, and privacy activists are going to be rather unhappy when
they digest the sobering implications of the talk, though they will
likely be upset for entirely different reasons.
In short, Apple built the very thing that they and the privacy community
have been saying for years is reckless, dangerous or impossible: a
high-value encryption key secured in a vault such that the key can’t be
stolen or misused by hackers or malicious insiders. And without a hint
of self-awareness Apple’s head of security engineering and architecture
went all the way to BlackHat in Las Vegas to boast about how they did it.
But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s start at the beginning...

This is what I've been saying all along. The assumption is ONLY that it
buys you some time to GTFO of that internet cafe and down the road. With
Tails, you get a level up in anonymity perhaps because the machine used
is at least hard, if not impossible to identify.
Case in point: The local internet provider here uses AOL upstream, and
one day, while torrenting (transmission, full encryption on) a music
album , my supervisor came in and asked if I was running a torrent
client... that she'd received a call from the local provider about
someone bootlegging. She's a sympathetic sort so I say 'yeah' and told
her what it was... A WARNER album.
AOL/Time/Warner is apparently sniffing every packet passing through
their servers identified as a torrent for bootleg content. It took about
an hour for AOL > Local provider and a phone call from them.

    The researchers said they also found evidence that the hackers took
    advantage of a programing interface built into Telegram to identify
    at least 15 million Iranian phone numbers with Telegram accounts
    registered to them, as well as the associated user IDs.
As a redundancy and elaboration of the former quote including
Multisyllabic phrases such as "systematic de-anonymization" to muddle
the issue, and make it appear to be another issue when it isn't.
Apparently all they got are the phone numbers from the sms verification,
and hackers didn't do it. The phoneco GAVE THEM the info. It requires
complicity on the part of the utility. Which is something one can assume
any commercial service would do if a government requests and under THEIR
LAW (Iran in this case) claims criminal activity. The extraction of data
they can do with that phone number It requires that you never set up an
account with password.

If I were managing the project I'd be limiting improvements that would

I never aspired to that sort of position... my underhand toss is lousy),

doesn't require deprecation of existing code in the product. Because
those things were already paid for and done. It does put the product at
a disadvantage against software meant to undo tor's security in the long
run however, and government excel at doing things that have their effect

@_subject: Apple at BlackHat: Reopening the "Going Dark" Debate (Lawfare) 
Just over a week ago, at the BlackHat hacker convention in Las Vegas,
Ivan Krstić, Head of Security Engineering and Architecture at Apple gave
a talk entitled “Behind the scenes of iOS Security,” the slides of which
are available here.
It’s a historic talk for a couple of reasons. First, Apple is
traditionally very secretive about how it technically does security on
its devices. Apple also announced its first bug bounty program. So far,
so newsworthy.
But something else happened at that talk. Unbeknownst to the presenter
or anybody in the audience, Apple just reopened the “Going Dark” dispute
between the FBI and the privacy community, and it turned the entire
dispute on its head. In the cold light of day, I suspect Apple, the US
government, and privacy activists are going to be rather unhappy when
they digest the sobering implications of the talk, though they will
likely be upset for entirely different reasons.
In short, Apple built the very thing that they and the privacy community
have been saying for years is reckless, dangerous or impossible: a
high-value encryption key secured in a vault such that the key can’t be
stolen or misused by hackers or malicious insiders. And without a hint
of self-awareness Apple’s head of security engineering and architecture
went all the way to BlackHat in Las Vegas to boast about how they did it.
But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s start at the beginning...

This is what I've been saying all along. The assumption is ONLY that it
buys you some time to GTFO of that internet cafe and down the road. With
Tails, you get a level up in anonymity perhaps because the machine used
is at least hard, if not impossible to identify.
Case in point: The local internet provider here uses AOL upstream, and
one day, while torrenting (transmission, full encryption on) a music
album , my supervisor came in and asked if I was running a torrent
client... that she'd received a call from the local provider about
someone bootlegging. She's a sympathetic sort so I say 'yeah' and told
her what it was... A WARNER album.
AOL/Time/Warner is apparently sniffing every packet passing through
their servers identified as a torrent for bootleg content. It took about
an hour for AOL > Local provider and a phone call from them.

    The researchers said they also found evidence that the hackers took
    advantage of a programing interface built into Telegram to identify
    at least 15 million Iranian phone numbers with Telegram accounts
    registered to them, as well as the associated user IDs.
As a redundancy and elaboration of the former quote including
Multisyllabic phrases such as "systematic de-anonymization" to muddle
the issue, and make it appear to be another issue when it isn't.
Apparently all they got are the phone numbers from the sms verification,
and hackers didn't do it. The phoneco GAVE THEM the info. It requires
complicity on the part of the utility. Which is something one can assume
any commercial service would do if a government requests and under THEIR
LAW (Iran in this case) claims criminal activity. The extraction of data
they can do with that phone number It requires that you never set up an
account with password.

If I were managing the project I'd be limiting improvements that would

I never aspired to that sort of position... my underhand toss is lousy),

doesn't require deprecation of existing code in the product. Because
those things were already paid for and done. It does put the product at
a disadvantage against software meant to undo tor's security in the long
run however, and government excel at doing things that have their effect

@_subject: Apple at BlackHat: Reopening the "Going Dark" Debate (Lawfare) 
Just over a week ago, at the BlackHat hacker convention in Las Vegas,
Ivan Krstić, Head of Security Engineering and Architecture at Apple gave
a talk entitled “Behind the scenes of iOS Security,” the slides of which
are available here.
It’s a historic talk for a couple of reasons. First, Apple is
traditionally very secretive about how it technically does security on
its devices. Apple also announced its first bug bounty program. So far,
so newsworthy.
But something else happened at that talk. Unbeknownst to the presenter
or anybody in the audience, Apple just reopened the “Going Dark” dispute
between the FBI and the privacy community, and it turned the entire
dispute on its head. In the cold light of day, I suspect Apple, the US
government, and privacy activists are going to be rather unhappy when
they digest the sobering implications of the talk, though they will
likely be upset for entirely different reasons.
In short, Apple built the very thing that they and the privacy community
have been saying for years is reckless, dangerous or impossible: a
high-value encryption key secured in a vault such that the key can’t be
stolen or misused by hackers or malicious insiders. And without a hint
of self-awareness Apple’s head of security engineering and architecture
went all the way to BlackHat in Las Vegas to boast about how they did it.
But I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s start at the beginning...

This is what I've been saying all along. The assumption is ONLY that it
buys you some time to GTFO of that internet cafe and down the road. With
Tails, you get a level up in anonymity perhaps because the machine used
is at least hard, if not impossible to identify.
Case in point: The local internet provider here uses AOL upstream, and
one day, while torrenting (transmission, full encryption on) a music
album , my supervisor came in and asked if I was running a torrent
client... that she'd received a call from the local provider about
someone bootlegging. She's a sympathetic sort so I say 'yeah' and told
her what it was... A WARNER album.
AOL/Time/Warner is apparently sniffing every packet passing through
their servers identified as a torrent for bootleg content. It took about
an hour for AOL > Local provider and a phone call from them.

for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped
our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a
handful of large corporations and political entities.” He asked the
country to be “brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment.”

@_subject: FYI: 10 Surprising Upsides To Colonialism 
I think I've found the worst article of 2016...
"Colonialism gets a bad rep these days, often with good reason. You’d
have to be a madman to look at King Leopold’s adventures in the Congo,
for example, and conclude that the Belgians were awesome imperial
overlords. Same deal with the slave-trading powers.
But that’s not the whole story of colonialism. Move beyond the headline
atrocities, and a more nuanced picture begins to emerge. Far from being
a nonstop cavalcade of horrors, colonialism often resulted in some
seriously awesome, surprising stuff.
10 Spreading Good Government
Most of us kind of take democracy and functioning government for
granted. But a largely democratic world was by no means inevitable. For
most of human history, “government” meant a military dictator or crazy
king telling you precisely where to live, what to wear, and when to die
in battle for some pointless cause.
So why does most of the world now at least pay lip service to democratic
norms? For that, you can thank the European colonial powers. Wherever
the British went, they instituted governments that looked like their
own. That meant parliaments, an efficient civil service, and a basic
package of democracy. The French, meanwhile, folded their conquered
territories into France itself, promoting Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite.
When decolonization finally rolled around, many of those democratic
institutions remained in place.
9 Creating Modern Medicine
For colonial powers, tropical diseases were a constant pain in the
derriere. Asia, Africa, and South America were swimming in bugs that had
a nasty tendency to kill colonists and subjects alike. That meant
unnecessary expenditure, time and men lost, and a problem extracting
that sweet, sweet natural wealth.
The solution? Throw everything modern medicine had at the problem.
Europe was at the vanguard of modern medicine in the 19th century. The
British discovered the antimalarial properties of quinine, which is
still our only effective antimalarial. The French became specialists in
tropical medicine thanks to their North African holdings. Public health
in general received a massive boost thanks to techniques learned in the
chaos of the colonies.
Even conquered natives benefited from this, in the form of hospitals and
new treatments pioneered in Europe. It’s no stretch to say modern
medicine is a by-product of imperialism.
8 Economic Booms
Of course, colonialism isn’t something that exists only in that fairy
tale land we call “the past.” Welcome to Africa, where the Chinese are
engaging in a massive exercise in 21st-century colonialism. According to
Zambian economist Dambisa Moyo, the resulting economic boom has been the
best thing to happen to the continent in decades.
Her data shows that this new colonialism has created jobs for millions
of Africans and lifted many out of poverty. The boon from Chinese
investment has massively benefited the poor in Africa and China alike.
That’s not to say all colonial adventures improve people’s lives.
Spanish dalliances in the New World memorably crashed Spain’s economy.
But it does show that imperialism can be handled well, in a way that
benefits the many rather than the few.
7 Global Languages
Remember the story of the Tower of Babel? Humans were getting all uppity
with their engineering prowess, so God scrambled their languages so they
could no longer cooperate. Well, colonialism was sort of like that in
reverse. From hundreds of thousands of different tongues, the age of
empires whittled humanity down to just a handful of big ones.
Seriously. There are currently 106 countries where English is spoken,
many of them former colonies. Spanish is spoken in 31, modern standard
Arabic in 58, and French in 53. Taken together, pretty much the entire
world speaks at least a smattering of English, Spanish, Arabic, French,
Russian, or Mandarin—all languages associated with imperial nations. And
that has massive advantages.
The ability to communicate breaks down barriers to trade and
understanding. It allows wildly different countries to find common
ground. While it’s not a prerequisite, it’s certainly helpful in uniting
6 The Creation Of Modern Art
Who likes Picasso? What about Art Deco architecture? Or modern
sculpture? We’re betting that at least half of you said yes to one of
those. In that case, you should probably be thankful for French and
British colonization of Africa. It was the display of African tribal art
in Paris and London at the dawn of the 20th century that inspired all of
these movements.
Artists like Picasso and Matisse saw the treasures from the Ivory Coast
or Benin City and were inspired. Architects were seduced by the simple,
powerful forms of ruined African temples. It was the imperial trade that
brought these objects to public view and allowed them to inspire
everyone from designers to artists to architects.
It’s incredible to think that, without African art, something like Art
Deco wouldn’t exist. New York would look completely different. The
cultural benefits of colonialism are all around us.
5 The Development Of Infrastructure
Over the last few years, parts of Africa have been undergoing an
infrastructure boom. Great railways have unrolled across the plains of
Nigeria, the mountains of Ethiopia, and along the lakeside shores of
Uganda and Kenya. The projects are expected to send local economies
booming, lifting millions out of poverty.
These vital new railways didn’t appear out of nowhere. They’re the
remains of colonial infrastructure, being updated for the first time in
decades. Ironically, the economic boom these railways will bring is
partly thanks to Africa’s former colonizers.
Wherever the great empires went, they left robust infrastructure in
their wake. India still uses Raj-era rolling stock today, transporting
millions across the subcontinent. Old colonial roads are still in use
alongside ports, hospitals, schools, and universities. While the
infrastructure initially benefited the colonizers, it has been
repurposed to help the colonized.
4 Removal Of Brutal Occupying Powers
The story of the Spanish conquest is portrayed as one of bloodthirsty
Europeans super-murdering millions of Aztecs. While that definitely
happened, there is one part of the story that gets left out: The Aztecs
themselves were occupiers who were in the middle of conquering
neighboring states when Cortez arrived. And you’d better believe they
were brutal.
The Aztecs worked captured enemies to death. They sacrificed them by
ripping out their hearts. They forced prisoners into cannibalism. They
murdered children to appease the Sun. The Spanish, too, were mega-jerks,
but most of their jerkiness came from accidentally importing smallpox
and running off with people’s gold. Compared to the bloodthirsty Aztecs,
they were practically saints.
You see this time and again in colonial societies. Before the British
arrived, the Mughals had marched over India and razed Delhi to the
ground eight times in eight centuries, building skull pyramids from its
inhabitants’ remains. Even at the Raj’s most brutal, no massacres
touched the mass murder and enslavement of those times. And while we’re
on the subject . . .
3 Increased Peace
For the vast majority of human history, life wasn’t fun. Competition for
resources forced tribes into a nearly perpetual state of warfare. In
Central America, for example, various Maya cities were only one failed
harvest away from massacring one another.
Steven Pinker has identified the creation of nation states as integral
to ending this violence. In some places, the rise of those states was
the result of fierce battles and endless politicking. In others, it was
a direct result of colonization. Suddenly, once-competing tribes were
bunged together and told to get along and swear allegiance to France,
Britain, Spain, or wherever. While that created a ton of resentment, it
halted the almost continuous cycle of killing, forging brand new
national identities that still exist today (like Indian or Ghanaian).
Sure, in some cases, like the Belgians in the Congo, the murder rate
went up after colonization. But the overarching story is one of enforced
peace, which isn’t great, but it’s still better than no peace at all.
2 The Creation Of Modern Tourism
One peculiar side effect of the age of empires was the creation of
modern tourism. Before the 19th century, going abroad was restricted to
the rich and the scientifically curious. Middle-class people in Britain
who wanted to go somewhere exciting went to the pub.
Then the British Empire arose, bringing with it tales of adventure in
far-off places with exotic, romantic names like India, Egypt, Jamaica,
and Australia. Realizing the public hunger for these places, a guy named
Thomas Cook started offering package tours to the empire’s outposts. In
one fell swoop, the concept of the modern tourist was born.
According to the Journal of Tourism History, empires provided the
perfect vector for the development of a global tourist industry. By
repackaging places like Australia from a convict island to a “Down Under
paradise,” people like Cook changed how we thought of these places forever.
1 It Saved Millions Of Lives
While their rulers and leaders were off gadding about the globe, it’s
worth remembering that Europe’s masses were living through hard times.
Mass famines were common. France alone suffered 40 devastating
nationwide famines between 1500 and 1800. Millions were dying every decade.
Into this chaos stepped an unlikely savior: Peru. Spanish conquistadors
had brought back a wonderous foodstuff from the colonized nation. It was
durable, easy to farm, full of nutrients, and nearly always gave a
bumper harvest. It was the potato.
Incredible as it may seem, introducing the potato to Europe saved
millions of lives. Suddenly, crops no longer failed en masse. Starvation
rates plummeted. Populations in rural economies like Ireland exploded,
and rates of stuff like scurvy dropped off. Without Spain’s imperialism
in the New World, this continent-transforming food would have never been
adopted, and your family tree would probably be a heck of a lot emptier."

Real world politics is complicated. Some people think I'm a
'jewkristiancommie' (Juan). Some think I'm a conservative. Some think
I'm a wild-eyed bomb-throwing anarchist black blockhead... Actually, I'm
all those things. It you have some 'party line' you're probably not
worth having a convo with. Indoctrinated people are boring.
Classic example. Here's someone I knew in the 60s who went down with Sam
Melville and it's said Melvill died in his arms at Attica. A Navy
Hardhat diver wh ran the Committee to support the National Liberation
Front, and one of Abbie Hoffman's closest friends. Written by a mutual
"October 17, 2010:
In early February 2009, I was skimming the Drudge Report and came across
a headline that went something like this: Protester Throws Shoes at
Mayor of Ithaca, New York. I immediately knew the shoe-thrower was my
friend Robin Palmer. Robin died this August at age 80. He was a born
rebel and lived in that skin all his life. He was never without a cause.
Usually multiple causes. Which sometimes seemed wildly contradictory.
Robin ran with the radical left Weathermen in the late 1960's and early
'70s. He spent several years in Attica prison for trying to bomb a New
York City bank. By this millennium he was sort-of right wing. Why
“sort-of”? Robin never regretted his terrorist actions or ceased
believing the U.S. was a villain in Vietnam. He referred to Ho Chi Minh
as “the George Washington of his people” and felt warmly toward his old
Weather-friends, Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn. When candidate Barack
Obama's relationship with Ayers in Chicago became a hot topic during the
2008 presidential race, Robin wrote missives to local newspapers lauding
Ayers and defending the Weatherman bombings. When election day rolled
around Robin didn't vote for Obama or McCain-- he wrote in Bill Ayers.
Flip side: Robin disagreed vehemently with the standard left positions
on Cuba and the Mid-East. When Robin denounced Fidel Castro at
gatherings of old New Leftists, he was struck from the rad honor roll.
(Attica only counted for so much.) His opinions on the Mid-East were
equally heretical. Robin was always strongly pro-Israel. Not gung-ho for
the PLO. By this millennium he stood 100 percent behind President Bush
and the war in Iraq. The shoe hurling incident sprang from that support.
The City of Ithaca had passed a resolution condemning the war. By
tossing his shoes at the mayor, Robin was tearing a page from the book
of Iraqi protesters who did likewise to Bush. Turning it upside down in
the process.
That's so Robin.
I first met Robin in New York City in the Spring of 1968..."

process is already sitting in reserve tanks in Saudi, Qatar etc.
Hundreds of square miles of facilities with a armies (literally) to
protect them. As it gets used, there simply isn't being enough oil
discovered at that sort of cost to replace it driving the cost up.
Almost every new 'find' the exploration companies make touted as
megafields turn out a few months or years later, without note in the

the TRILLION DOLLAR WARS required to secure it, to the sludge they call
tar sands and Shale/Bakken oil that is SO expensive to turn into
anything usable that it's literally considered junk investing and a scam

@_subject: Former UK ambassador:: I picked up the Clinton emails from a Democrat 
A Wikileaks envoy today claims he personally received Clinton campaign
emails in Washington D.C. after they were leaked by 'disgusted'
whisteblowers - and not hacked by Russia.
Craig Murray, former British ambassador to Uzbekistan and a close
associate of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, told Dailymail.com that
he flew to Washington, D.C. for a clandestine hand-off with one of the
email sources in September.
'Neither of [the leaks] came from the Russians,' said Murray in an
interview with Dailymail.com on Tuesday. 'The source had legal access to
the information. The documents came from inside leaks, not hacks.'
His account contradicts directly the version of how thousands of
Democratic emails were published before the election being advanced by
U.S. intelligence.
Craig Murray (left), former British ambassador to Uzbekistan and a close
associate of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange (right), told the
Dailymail.com that he flew to Washington, D.C. for a clandestine
hand-off with one of the email sources in September
Murray is a controversial figure who was removed from his post as a
British ambassador amid allegations of misconduct. He was cleared of
those but left the diplomatic service in acrimony.
His links to Wikileaks are well known and while his account is likely to
be seen as both unprovable and possibly biased, it is also the first
intervention by Wikileaks since reports surfaced last week that the CIA
believed Russia hacked the Clinton emails to help hand the election to
Donald Trump.
Murray's claims about the origins of the Clinton campaign emails comes
as U.S. intelligence officials are increasingly confident that Russian
hackers infiltrated both the Democratic National Committee and the email
account of top Clinton aide John Podesta.
In Podesta's case, his account appeared to have been compromised through
a basic 'phishing' scheme, the New York Times reported on Wednesday.
U.S. intelligence officials have reportedly told members of Congress
during classified briefings that they believe Russians passed the
documents on to Wikileaks as part of an influence operation to swing the
election in favor of Donald Trump.
But Murray insisted that the DNC and Podesta emails published by
Wikileaks did not come from the Russians, and were given to the
whistleblowing group by Americans who had authorized access to the
'Neither of [the leaks] came from the Russians,'  Murray said. 'The
source had legal access to the information. The documents came from
inside leaks, not hacks.'
He said the leakers were motivated by 'disgust at the corruption of the
Clinton Foundation and the tilting of the primary election playing field
against Bernie Sanders.'
Murray said he retrieved the package from a source during a clandestine
meeting in a wooded area near American University, in northwest D.C. He
said the individual he met with was not the original person who obtained
the information, but an intermediary.
Murray claims he met with the person who passed the emails over in a
Washington, D.C. part near American University
His account cannot be independently verified but is in line with
previous statements by Wikileaks - which was the organization that
published the Podesta and DNC emails.
Wikileaks published the DNC messages in July and the Podesta messages in
October. The messages revealed efforts by some DNC officials to
undermine the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was
running against Hillary Clinton.
Others revealed that Clinton aides were concerned about potential
conflicts and mismanagement at the Clinton Foundation.
Murray declined to say where the sources worked and how they had access
to the information, to shield their identities.
He suggested that Podesta's emails might be 'of legitimate interest to
the security services' in the U.S., due to his communications with Saudi
Arabia lobbyists and foreign officials.
Murray said he was speaking out due to claims from intelligence
officials that Wikileaks was given the documents by Russian hackers as
part of an effort to help Donald Trump win the U.S. presidential election.
'I don't understand why the CIA would say the information came from
Russian hackers when they must know that isn't true,' he said.
'Regardless of whether the Russians hacked into the DNC, the documents
Wikileaks published did not come from that.'
Murray was a vocal critic of human rights abuses in Uzbekistan while
serving as ambassador between 2002 and 2004, a stance that pitted him
against the UK Foreign Office.
He describes himself as a 'close associate' of Julian Assange and has
spoken out in support of the Wikileaks founder who has faced rape
allegations and is currently confined to the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
Assange has similarly disputed that charges that Wikileaks received the
leaked emails from Russian sources.
'The Clinton camp has been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria
that Russia is responsible for everything,' Assange told John Pilger
during an interview in November.
'Hillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US
intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our
publications. That's false – we can say that the Russian government is
not the source.'
Murray suggested that John Podesta's emails might be 'of legitimate
interest to the security services' in the U.S., due to his
communications with Saudi Arabia lobbyists and foreign officials
The Washington Post reported last Friday that U.S. intelligence agencies
had 'identified individuals with connections to the Russian government
who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails.'
The paper said U.S. senators were presented with information tying
Russia to the leaks during a recent briefing by intelligence officials.
'It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia's goal
here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get
elected,' a senior U.S. official familiar with the briefing told the
Post. 'That's the consensus view.'

The Obama administration has been examining Russia's potential role in
trying to influence the presidential election. Officials said Russians
hacked the Republican National Committee, but did not release that
information in a deliberate effort to damage Clinton and protect Donald
Several congressional committees are also looking into the suspected
Russian interference.
While there is a consensus on Capitol Hill that Russia hacked U.S.
political groups and officials, some Republicans say it's not clear
whether the motive was to try to swing the election or just to collect
'Now whether they intended to interfere to the degree that they were
trying to elect a certain candidate, I think that's the subject of
investigation,' said Sen. John McCain on CBS Face the Nation. 'But facts
are stubborn things, they did hack into this campaign.'
President elect Donald Trump raised doubts about the reports and said
this was an 'excuse' by Democrats to explain Clinton's November loss.
'It's just another excuse. I don't believe it,' said Trump on Fox News

I think you're confusing Progressive-Liberals with "Left-Wing".
Progressive-Liberals aren't to the 'left' of anything except perhaps
John McCain. It's mainly the Clinton crowd hanging onto the "Russia did
it" trope. Hillary Clinton is certainly NOT "Left". She's a corporatist
warmonger. Most of the people I know who I consider 'left' consider
elections a sham that reinforces existing systems and don't participate.
Others may have voted in the primaries for Sanders, and disillusioned
despite warnings from anyone who knew anything about the Democrats and
Bernie (just ask anyone in Vermont how 'left' Sanders is), stood down
and didn't vote, or perhaps voted for Stein.
I don't really think the Russian government cares whose president of the
US at all as long as the person isn't nutjob enough to push the button
as soon as they're inaugurated. They have their own country to run. I
also just read that Russia is no longer in the big five military

problem. That 'liberation theology' isn't intended to liberate anyone.
It's Catholicism's foothold into 3rd world nations so it can run their
cult scam there. Priest and nuns that actually believe in it usually end
up massacred, and the church is like 'tsk tsk...'
Catholicism is the Zionism of Christianity. A socio-political graft onto
Christianity, a philosophy useful for subverting and conquering people.

“This is the problem with the media. You guys took everything that
Donald Trump said so literally,” ~Corey Lewandowski
“THE ESTABLISHMENT,” Donald Trump famously said during his closing
argument for the presidency, “has trillions of dollars at stake in this
election.” He described “a global power structure that is responsible
for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped
our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a
handful of large corporations and political entities.” He asked the
country to be “brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment.”
Now, less than four weeks after riding that line to victory, he formally
invited the establishment into his administration."

@_subject: FYI: 10 Surprising Upsides To Colonialism 
I think I've found the worst article of 2016...
"Colonialism gets a bad rep these days, often with good reason. You’d
have to be a madman to look at King Leopold’s adventures in the Congo,
for example, and conclude that the Belgians were awesome imperial
overlords. Same deal with the slave-trading powers.
But that’s not the whole story of colonialism. Move beyond the headline
atrocities, and a more nuanced picture begins to emerge. Far from being
a nonstop cavalcade of horrors, colonialism often resulted in some
seriously awesome, surprising stuff.
10 Spreading Good Government
Most of us kind of take democracy and functioning government for
granted. But a largely democratic world was by no means inevitable. For
most of human history, “government” meant a military dictator or crazy
king telling you precisely where to live, what to wear, and when to die
in battle for some pointless cause.
So why does most of the world now at least pay lip service to democratic
norms? For that, you can thank the European colonial powers. Wherever
the British went, they instituted governments that looked like their
own. That meant parliaments, an efficient civil service, and a basic
package of democracy. The French, meanwhile, folded their conquered
territories into France itself, promoting Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite.
When decolonization finally rolled around, many of those democratic
institutions remained in place.
9 Creating Modern Medicine
For colonial powers, tropical diseases were a constant pain in the
derriere. Asia, Africa, and South America were swimming in bugs that had
a nasty tendency to kill colonists and subjects alike. That meant
unnecessary expenditure, time and men lost, and a problem extracting
that sweet, sweet natural wealth.
The solution? Throw everything modern medicine had at the problem.
Europe was at the vanguard of modern medicine in the 19th century. The
British discovered the antimalarial properties of quinine, which is
still our only effective antimalarial. The French became specialists in
tropical medicine thanks to their North African holdings. Public health
in general received a massive boost thanks to techniques learned in the
chaos of the colonies.
Even conquered natives benefited from this, in the form of hospitals and
new treatments pioneered in Europe. It’s no stretch to say modern
medicine is a by-product of imperialism.
8 Economic Booms
Of course, colonialism isn’t something that exists only in that fairy
tale land we call “the past.” Welcome to Africa, where the Chinese are
engaging in a massive exercise in 21st-century colonialism. According to
Zambian economist Dambisa Moyo, the resulting economic boom has been the
best thing to happen to the continent in decades.
Her data shows that this new colonialism has created jobs for millions
of Africans and lifted many out of poverty. The boon from Chinese
investment has massively benefited the poor in Africa and China alike.
That’s not to say all colonial adventures improve people’s lives.
Spanish dalliances in the New World memorably crashed Spain’s economy.
But it does show that imperialism can be handled well, in a way that
benefits the many rather than the few.
7 Global Languages
Remember the story of the Tower of Babel? Humans were getting all uppity
with their engineering prowess, so God scrambled their languages so they
could no longer cooperate. Well, colonialism was sort of like that in
reverse. From hundreds of thousands of different tongues, the age of
empires whittled humanity down to just a handful of big ones.
Seriously. There are currently 106 countries where English is spoken,
many of them former colonies. Spanish is spoken in 31, modern standard
Arabic in 58, and French in 53. Taken together, pretty much the entire
world speaks at least a smattering of English, Spanish, Arabic, French,
Russian, or Mandarin—all languages associated with imperial nations. And
that has massive advantages.
The ability to communicate breaks down barriers to trade and
understanding. It allows wildly different countries to find common
ground. While it’s not a prerequisite, it’s certainly helpful in uniting
6 The Creation Of Modern Art
Who likes Picasso? What about Art Deco architecture? Or modern
sculpture? We’re betting that at least half of you said yes to one of
those. In that case, you should probably be thankful for French and
British colonization of Africa. It was the display of African tribal art
in Paris and London at the dawn of the 20th century that inspired all of
these movements.
Artists like Picasso and Matisse saw the treasures from the Ivory Coast
or Benin City and were inspired. Architects were seduced by the simple,
powerful forms of ruined African temples. It was the imperial trade that
brought these objects to public view and allowed them to inspire
everyone from designers to artists to architects.
It’s incredible to think that, without African art, something like Art
Deco wouldn’t exist. New York would look completely different. The
cultural benefits of colonialism are all around us.
5 The Development Of Infrastructure
Over the last few years, parts of Africa have been undergoing an
infrastructure boom. Great railways have unrolled across the plains of
Nigeria, the mountains of Ethiopia, and along the lakeside shores of
Uganda and Kenya. The projects are expected to send local economies
booming, lifting millions out of poverty.
These vital new railways didn’t appear out of nowhere. They’re the
remains of colonial infrastructure, being updated for the first time in
decades. Ironically, the economic boom these railways will bring is
partly thanks to Africa’s former colonizers.
Wherever the great empires went, they left robust infrastructure in
their wake. India still uses Raj-era rolling stock today, transporting
millions across the subcontinent. Old colonial roads are still in use
alongside ports, hospitals, schools, and universities. While the
infrastructure initially benefited the colonizers, it has been
repurposed to help the colonized.
4 Removal Of Brutal Occupying Powers
The story of the Spanish conquest is portrayed as one of bloodthirsty
Europeans super-murdering millions of Aztecs. While that definitely
happened, there is one part of the story that gets left out: The Aztecs
themselves were occupiers who were in the middle of conquering
neighboring states when Cortez arrived. And you’d better believe they
were brutal.
The Aztecs worked captured enemies to death. They sacrificed them by
ripping out their hearts. They forced prisoners into cannibalism. They
murdered children to appease the Sun. The Spanish, too, were mega-jerks,
but most of their jerkiness came from accidentally importing smallpox
and running off with people’s gold. Compared to the bloodthirsty Aztecs,
they were practically saints.
You see this time and again in colonial societies. Before the British
arrived, the Mughals had marched over India and razed Delhi to the
ground eight times in eight centuries, building skull pyramids from its
inhabitants’ remains. Even at the Raj’s most brutal, no massacres
touched the mass murder and enslavement of those times. And while we’re
on the subject . . .
3 Increased Peace
For the vast majority of human history, life wasn’t fun. Competition for
resources forced tribes into a nearly perpetual state of warfare. In
Central America, for example, various Maya cities were only one failed
harvest away from massacring one another.
Steven Pinker has identified the creation of nation states as integral
to ending this violence. In some places, the rise of those states was
the result of fierce battles and endless politicking. In others, it was
a direct result of colonization. Suddenly, once-competing tribes were
bunged together and told to get along and swear allegiance to France,
Britain, Spain, or wherever. While that created a ton of resentment, it
halted the almost continuous cycle of killing, forging brand new
national identities that still exist today (like Indian or Ghanaian).
Sure, in some cases, like the Belgians in the Congo, the murder rate
went up after colonization. But the overarching story is one of enforced
peace, which isn’t great, but it’s still better than no peace at all.
2 The Creation Of Modern Tourism
One peculiar side effect of the age of empires was the creation of
modern tourism. Before the 19th century, going abroad was restricted to
the rich and the scientifically curious. Middle-class people in Britain
who wanted to go somewhere exciting went to the pub.
Then the British Empire arose, bringing with it tales of adventure in
far-off places with exotic, romantic names like India, Egypt, Jamaica,
and Australia. Realizing the public hunger for these places, a guy named
Thomas Cook started offering package tours to the empire’s outposts. In
one fell swoop, the concept of the modern tourist was born.
According to the Journal of Tourism History, empires provided the
perfect vector for the development of a global tourist industry. By
repackaging places like Australia from a convict island to a “Down Under
paradise,” people like Cook changed how we thought of these places forever.
1 It Saved Millions Of Lives
While their rulers and leaders were off gadding about the globe, it’s
worth remembering that Europe’s masses were living through hard times.
Mass famines were common. France alone suffered 40 devastating
nationwide famines between 1500 and 1800. Millions were dying every decade.
Into this chaos stepped an unlikely savior: Peru. Spanish conquistadors
had brought back a wonderous foodstuff from the colonized nation. It was
durable, easy to farm, full of nutrients, and nearly always gave a
bumper harvest. It was the potato.
Incredible as it may seem, introducing the potato to Europe saved
millions of lives. Suddenly, crops no longer failed en masse. Starvation
rates plummeted. Populations in rural economies like Ireland exploded,
and rates of stuff like scurvy dropped off. Without Spain’s imperialism
in the New World, this continent-transforming food would have never been
adopted, and your family tree would probably be a heck of a lot emptier."

Real world politics is complicated. Some people think I'm a
'jewkristiancommie' (Juan). Some think I'm a conservative. Some think
I'm a wild-eyed bomb-throwing anarchist black blockhead... Actually, I'm
all those things. It you have some 'party line' you're probably not
worth having a convo with. Indoctrinated people are boring.
Classic example. Here's someone I knew in the 60s who went down with Sam
Melville and it's said Melvill died in his arms at Attica. A Navy
Hardhat diver wh ran the Committee to support the National Liberation
Front, and one of Abbie Hoffman's closest friends. Written by a mutual
"October 17, 2010:
In early February 2009, I was skimming the Drudge Report and came across
a headline that went something like this: Protester Throws Shoes at
Mayor of Ithaca, New York. I immediately knew the shoe-thrower was my
friend Robin Palmer. Robin died this August at age 80. He was a born
rebel and lived in that skin all his life. He was never without a cause.
Usually multiple causes. Which sometimes seemed wildly contradictory.
Robin ran with the radical left Weathermen in the late 1960's and early
'70s. He spent several years in Attica prison for trying to bomb a New
York City bank. By this millennium he was sort-of right wing. Why
“sort-of”? Robin never regretted his terrorist actions or ceased
believing the U.S. was a villain in Vietnam. He referred to Ho Chi Minh
as “the George Washington of his people” and felt warmly toward his old
Weather-friends, Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn. When candidate Barack
Obama's relationship with Ayers in Chicago became a hot topic during the
2008 presidential race, Robin wrote missives to local newspapers lauding
Ayers and defending the Weatherman bombings. When election day rolled
around Robin didn't vote for Obama or McCain-- he wrote in Bill Ayers.
Flip side: Robin disagreed vehemently with the standard left positions
on Cuba and the Mid-East. When Robin denounced Fidel Castro at
gatherings of old New Leftists, he was struck from the rad honor roll.
(Attica only counted for so much.) His opinions on the Mid-East were
equally heretical. Robin was always strongly pro-Israel. Not gung-ho for
the PLO. By this millennium he stood 100 percent behind President Bush
and the war in Iraq. The shoe hurling incident sprang from that support.
The City of Ithaca had passed a resolution condemning the war. By
tossing his shoes at the mayor, Robin was tearing a page from the book
of Iraqi protesters who did likewise to Bush. Turning it upside down in
the process.
That's so Robin.
I first met Robin in New York City in the Spring of 1968..."

Punching Nazis, otherwise known as "fash-bashing," is part of a long,
storied tradition of anti-fascist violence, carried out by communists,
socialists and leftists wherever fascism has reared its head. Captain
America did it. Indiana Jones did it. Even Geraldo Rivera did it once on
his own talk show when a group of skinhead guests started brawling with
other guests.
Since Trump's campaign became a boon to white supremacists, memes
promoting aggression against the alt-right dominate Twitter, private
Facebook groups and subreddits.
But is punching a Nazi ethical? More important, is it a viable way to
stop fascists? Mic asked the experts: ethicists and academics who
specialize in moral dilemmas and political activism.

I'm only going to reply in brief and don't care to discuss or follow up
but essentially what's happened is all the 'easy oil'. The light sweet
stuff that just bubbles up out of the ground and is cheap to extract and
process is already sitting in reserve tanks in Saudi, Qatar etc.
Hundreds of square miles of facilities with a armies (literally) to
protect them. As it gets used, there simply isn't being enough oil
discovered at that sort of cost to replace it driving the cost up.
Almost every new 'find' the exploration companies make touted as
megafields turn out a few months or years later, without note in the
media, to be duds. As the oil becomes more expensive to process. from
the TRILLION DOLLAR WARS required to secure it, to the sludge they call
tar sands and Shale/Bakken oil that is SO expensive to turn into
anything usable that it's literally considered junk investing and a scam
by most energy market people, those increased costs show in the price of
the oil.
I recommend Paul Roberts "The End Of Oil" very highly. He does an
excellent job, in a dozen pages or so, of describing a modern history of

@_subject: Former UK ambassador:: I picked up the Clinton emails from a Democrat 
A Wikileaks envoy today claims he personally received Clinton campaign
emails in Washington D.C. after they were leaked by 'disgusted'
whisteblowers - and not hacked by Russia.
Craig Murray, former British ambassador to Uzbekistan and a close
associate of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, told Dailymail.com that
he flew to Washington, D.C. for a clandestine hand-off with one of the
email sources in September.
'Neither of [the leaks] came from the Russians,' said Murray in an
interview with Dailymail.com on Tuesday. 'The source had legal access to
the information. The documents came from inside leaks, not hacks.'
His account contradicts directly the version of how thousands of
Democratic emails were published before the election being advanced by
U.S. intelligence.
Craig Murray (left), former British ambassador to Uzbekistan and a close
associate of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange (right), told the
Dailymail.com that he flew to Washington, D.C. for a clandestine
hand-off with one of the email sources in September
Murray is a controversial figure who was removed from his post as a
British ambassador amid allegations of misconduct. He was cleared of
those but left the diplomatic service in acrimony.
His links to Wikileaks are well known and while his account is likely to
be seen as both unprovable and possibly biased, it is also the first
intervention by Wikileaks since reports surfaced last week that the CIA
believed Russia hacked the Clinton emails to help hand the election to
Donald Trump.
Murray's claims about the origins of the Clinton campaign emails comes
as U.S. intelligence officials are increasingly confident that Russian
hackers infiltrated both the Democratic National Committee and the email
account of top Clinton aide John Podesta.
In Podesta's case, his account appeared to have been compromised through
a basic 'phishing' scheme, the New York Times reported on Wednesday.
U.S. intelligence officials have reportedly told members of Congress
during classified briefings that they believe Russians passed the
documents on to Wikileaks as part of an influence operation to swing the
election in favor of Donald Trump.
But Murray insisted that the DNC and Podesta emails published by
Wikileaks did not come from the Russians, and were given to the
whistleblowing group by Americans who had authorized access to the
'Neither of [the leaks] came from the Russians,'  Murray said. 'The
source had legal access to the information. The documents came from
inside leaks, not hacks.'
He said the leakers were motivated by 'disgust at the corruption of the
Clinton Foundation and the tilting of the primary election playing field
against Bernie Sanders.'
Murray said he retrieved the package from a source during a clandestine
meeting in a wooded area near American University, in northwest D.C. He
said the individual he met with was not the original person who obtained
the information, but an intermediary.
Murray claims he met with the person who passed the emails over in a
Washington, D.C. part near American University
His account cannot be independently verified but is in line with
previous statements by Wikileaks - which was the organization that
published the Podesta and DNC emails.
Wikileaks published the DNC messages in July and the Podesta messages in
October. The messages revealed efforts by some DNC officials to
undermine the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was
running against Hillary Clinton.
Others revealed that Clinton aides were concerned about potential
conflicts and mismanagement at the Clinton Foundation.
Murray declined to say where the sources worked and how they had access
to the information, to shield their identities.
He suggested that Podesta's emails might be 'of legitimate interest to
the security services' in the U.S., due to his communications with Saudi
Arabia lobbyists and foreign officials.
Murray said he was speaking out due to claims from intelligence
officials that Wikileaks was given the documents by Russian hackers as
part of an effort to help Donald Trump win the U.S. presidential election.
'I don't understand why the CIA would say the information came from
Russian hackers when they must know that isn't true,' he said.
'Regardless of whether the Russians hacked into the DNC, the documents
Wikileaks published did not come from that.'
Murray was a vocal critic of human rights abuses in Uzbekistan while
serving as ambassador between 2002 and 2004, a stance that pitted him
against the UK Foreign Office.
He describes himself as a 'close associate' of Julian Assange and has
spoken out in support of the Wikileaks founder who has faced rape
allegations and is currently confined to the Ecuadorian embassy in London.
Assange has similarly disputed that charges that Wikileaks received the
leaked emails from Russian sources.
'The Clinton camp has been able to project a neo-McCarthyist hysteria
that Russia is responsible for everything,' Assange told John Pilger
during an interview in November.
'Hillary Clinton has stated multiple times, falsely, that 17 US
intelligence agencies had assessed that Russia was the source of our
publications. That's false – we can say that the Russian government is
not the source.'
Murray suggested that John Podesta's emails might be 'of legitimate
interest to the security services' in the U.S., due to his
communications with Saudi Arabia lobbyists and foreign officials
The Washington Post reported last Friday that U.S. intelligence agencies
had 'identified individuals with connections to the Russian government
who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails.'
The paper said U.S. senators were presented with information tying
Russia to the leaks during a recent briefing by intelligence officials.
'It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia's goal
here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get
elected,' a senior U.S. official familiar with the briefing told the
Post. 'That's the consensus view.'

The Obama administration has been examining Russia's potential role in
trying to influence the presidential election. Officials said Russians
hacked the Republican National Committee, but did not release that
information in a deliberate effort to damage Clinton and protect Donald
Several congressional committees are also looking into the suspected
Russian interference.
While there is a consensus on Capitol Hill that Russia hacked U.S.
political groups and officials, some Republicans say it's not clear
whether the motive was to try to swing the election or just to collect
'Now whether they intended to interfere to the degree that they were
trying to elect a certain candidate, I think that's the subject of
investigation,' said Sen. John McCain on CBS Face the Nation. 'But facts
are stubborn things, they did hack into this campaign.'
President elect Donald Trump raised doubts about the reports and said
this was an 'excuse' by Democrats to explain Clinton's November loss.
'It's just another excuse. I don't believe it,' said Trump on Fox News

Progressive-Liberals aren't to the 'left' of anything except perhaps
John McCain. It's mainly the Clinton crowd hanging onto the "Russia did

warmonger. Most of the people I know who I consider 'left' consider
elections a sham that reinforces existing systems and don't participate.
Others may have voted in the primaries for Sanders, and disillusioned
despite warnings from anyone who knew anything about the Democrats and
Bernie (just ask anyone in Vermont how 'left' Sanders is), stood down
and didn't vote, or perhaps voted for Stein.
I don't really think the Russian government cares whose president of the

as soon as they're inaugurated. They have their own country to run. I

they should have done years ago (but the society's repressive

The bad? For Americans, their rights are OSTENSIBLY endangered in place

** Law Enforcement Online: Innovative Doesn’t Mean Illegal (
Judith Germano (
Even the Wild West needed a sheriff. And today’s law enforcement agents, to be effective, need more than a Colt .45 and a gold star. Criminal actors have an increasing ability to commit serious crimes remotely via computers, while concealing their identity and location through the use of various means, including Tor hidden service protocols. To effectively identify and apprehend these criminals, law enforcement must be nimble and technologically savvy, and must employ regularly updated investigative tools. These tools include Network Investigative Techniques (NITs), which enable law enforcement (pursuant to court-authorized warrants) to identify the real IP address of web users, regardless of proxy settings. Some NITs also reveal users’ operating systems, CPU architecture, and session identification, and others (pursuant to a Title III or FISA warrant) can allow real-time, full-system monitoring.
There has been some level of controversy recently regarding the FBI’s use of NITs. But as criminals evolve and become increasingly sophisticated through the use of Tor and encryption techniques, so too must law enforcement’s investigative measures evolve, provided they are employed in accordance with lawful procedures and adequate constitutional safeguards.
It was through a NIT that the FBI, in 2015, was able to successfully take down one of the largest dark web child exploitation sites in the world, to apprehend child predators. The site, disturbingly named “Playpen,” provided thousands of pedophiles ( with images of horrifying sexual abuse of children, as well as guidance on how the molesters could avoid being detected. The Playpen site is reported to have had as many as 215,000 accounts within the first year, and an average of 11,000 unique visitors per week. The FBI, pursuant to a court order ( , seized the web host server in North Carolina and, rather than shutting it down immediately, ran it under FBI control for a limited, two-week period. During that time, the FBI used a NIT, which exploited a security vulnerability in the Tor Browser Bundle, to identify more than 1,300 true IP addresses. More, see link at top.

dDos doesn't work over tor very well, if at all. The IRC bot method
employed by that hacked LOIC program was closer to being functional and
secure... assuming no logs would be kept (and the software wasn't
designed to leak info about the usr), which, as can be seen by "Ryan"'s
dox dump of logs from one of the anon IRC servers, was not the case.
The point is to make it's use pervasive and that makes it expensive to
counter, and you BREAK THEM or at least inhibit their ability to go
after anyone but the highest-of-value targets. That's why I support tor
and promote it. Not because it makes one 'invulnerable, but because the
more people who use it, the more impossible it gets for the authorities
to cope. Telling people not to use it actually helps the feds in more
ways than just 'in the clear' comms, and the gubmint's social engineers
who cut tor down for it's insecurities at places like this list know that.

A few years ago when I was still writing news copy for an alt radio news
personality I was personally following the Waxman investigation into
Blackwater. Publicly over the Nisoor Square shooting, but they were
going to cover other issues behind closed doors such as Blackwater's
gun-running  (CPA Glocks w/o serial numbers to Turkish city crime gangs
for a start), which had been followed by McClatchy news service, and I
was using their copy on my blogger posts.
One morning, right before the hearings were about to begin, I was
checking my site counter and discovered a hit from PentagonMil on one of
those posts... What? Me worry?
But what followed next should disturbing to anyone who thought the feds
understood infosec or had someone on payroll who understands.
Apparently the person who viewed it first saved it to their desktop
complete with the site counter jscript, and the next few hits after
that, instead of showing a typical http path, showed the path through
pentagonmil to the desktop names of people the original viewer had
passed the page around to. The pentagon was letting my saved blog page
'phone home'. They hadn't blocked outgoing script action.

It might fit in the QA end of the biz. Someone has to test security.
Whether your agreement with the company allows them to 'contract' you to
a 3rd party's task... I REALLY doubt it judging from my industrial end
(drive manufacturing) experience. They're really REALLY concerned about
letting any information about the creation of the product out of their
grasp. It probably violates you confidentiality and intellectual
property agreement with the company.
Can the government make you violate that agreement? Can they make Apple
change it's agreement with you? Can the government force you to change a
worker's job description or hire/accept a government contract worker or
Iow, tell you how to run your business...
Dunno. But IF an employee claimed confidentiality and intellectual
property agreement as rationale for non-cooperation... Would the
government also go after that employee? Force Apple to discipline or
fire them?
It's gonna be interesting to see how this goes, but I suspect Apple will
cooperate, in secret b/c FISC/A, and do the government's bidding. If
they really can. We may never find out.
Yes, but those phones didn't have the self-destruct code if I remember
correctly. Apple claims it can't work around it.

It's NOT insubordination if it's NOT your job description. Telling a
coder whose never done anything besides sit at a desk and code they need
to do janitorial tasks for instance.
Telling someone who writes crypto that it's also their job to torture
test it is going to step on the QA director's toes, ya think? If anyone
can be legitimately tasked, it would be the QA department.
It's also dysfunctional to let someone who created the code test it.
That's like letting a machinist who created the part certify it's
Mil-spec 415-D compliance.
Otoh Apple COULD change the job description... IF they want to
re-negotiate the person's salary.
If that person walked I'd speculate there'd be dozens of companies
willing to hire them just because they walked instead of cooperating
with the feds.
The government can't require them to hire anyone.
Further, If the government forces them to add a government paid
contractor or govt employee they could sue for damages caused by
reputation loss with their commercial vendors who buy and sell their
products and material. I'll bet they can easily prove it too! By
charting the DIVE iPhone sales take if they publicly cooperate.
All in all the government demanding a private entity do ANYTHING without
the full force of the law, not JUST some interpretation by the DOJ
backed by some district court hack is a dysfunctional mess that would
tie the government up in court until ios is so fucking obsolete no one
even remembers what it was.
But as I said, as soon as this is out of the news, and Apple has made
enough noise to calm their customers, they'll just do it in secret, as
FISC/A requires. If they can.

A few years ago this guy, a chemical engineer, who worked at a local

of a nearby cement plant to experiment with sinking CO2 into the
concrete as a way to help the environment, needed to find another job
because the 'suits' were having too much fun driving their leased

He was looking at a job in the SF Bay area as an engineer at a thin-film

** Law Enforcement Online: Innovative Doesn’t Mean Illegal (
Judith Germano (
Even the Wild West needed a sheriff. And today’s law enforcement agents, to be effective, need more than a Colt .45 and a gold star. Criminal actors have an increasing ability to commit serious crimes remotely via computers, while concealing their identity and location through the use of various means, including Tor hidden service protocols. To effectively identify and apprehend these criminals, law enforcement must be nimble and technologically savvy, and must employ regularly updated investigative tools. These tools include Network Investigative Techniques (NITs), which enable law enforcement (pursuant to court-authorized warrants) to identify the real IP address of web users, regardless of proxy settings. Some NITs also reveal users’ operating systems, CPU architecture, and session identification, and others (pursuant to a Title III or FISA warrant) can allow real-time, full-system monitoring.
There has been some level of controversy recently regarding the FBI’s use of NITs. But as criminals evolve and become increasingly sophisticated through the use of Tor and encryption techniques, so too must law enforcement’s investigative measures evolve, provided they are employed in accordance with lawful procedures and adequate constitutional safeguards.
It was through a NIT that the FBI, in 2015, was able to successfully take down one of the largest dark web child exploitation sites in the world, to apprehend child predators. The site, disturbingly named “Playpen,” provided thousands of pedophiles ( with images of horrifying sexual abuse of children, as well as guidance on how the molesters could avoid being detected. The Playpen site is reported to have had as many as 215,000 accounts within the first year, and an average of 11,000 unique visitors per week. The FBI, pursuant to a court order ( , seized the web host server in North Carolina and, rather than shutting it down immediately, ran it under FBI control for a limited, two-week period. During that time, the FBI used a NIT, which exploited a security vulnerability in the Tor Browser Bundle, to identify more than 1,300 true IP addresses. More, see link at top.

dDos doesn't work over tor very well, if at all. The IRC bot method
employed by that hacked LOIC program was closer to being functional and
secure... assuming no logs would be kept (and the software wasn't
designed to leak info about the usr), which, as can be seen by "Ryan"'s
dox dump of logs from one of the anon IRC servers, was not the case.
The point is to make it's use pervasive and that makes it expensive to
counter, and you BREAK THEM or at least inhibit their ability to go
after anyone but the highest-of-value targets. That's why I support tor
and promote it. Not because it makes one 'invulnerable, but because the
more people who use it, the more impossible it gets for the authorities
to cope. Telling people not to use it actually helps the feds in more
ways than just 'in the clear' comms, and the gubmint's social engineers
who cut tor down for it's insecurities at places like this list know that.

A few years ago when I was still writing news copy for an alt radio news
personality I was personally following the Waxman investigation into
Blackwater. Publicly over the Nisoor Square shooting, but they were
going to cover other issues behind closed doors such as Blackwater's
gun-running  (CPA Glocks w/o serial numbers to Turkish city crime gangs
for a start), which had been followed by McClatchy news service, and I
was using their copy on my blogger posts.
One morning, right before the hearings were about to begin, I was
checking my site counter and discovered a hit from PentagonMil on one of
those posts... What? Me worry?
But what followed next should disturbing to anyone who thought the feds
understood infosec or had someone on payroll who understands.
Apparently the person who viewed it first saved it to their desktop
complete with the site counter jscript, and the next few hits after
that, instead of showing a typical http path, showed the path through
pentagonmil to the desktop names of people the original viewer had
passed the page around to. The pentagon was letting my saved blog page
'phone home'. They hadn't blocked outgoing script action.

It might fit in the QA end of the biz. Someone has to test security.
Whether your agreement with the company allows them to 'contract' you to
a 3rd party's task... I REALLY doubt it judging from my industrial end
(drive manufacturing) experience. They're really REALLY concerned about
letting any information about the creation of the product out of their
grasp. It probably violates you confidentiality and intellectual
property agreement with the company.
Can the government make you violate that agreement? Can they make Apple
change it's agreement with you? Can the government force you to change a
worker's job description or hire/accept a government contract worker or
Iow, tell you how to run your business...
Dunno. But IF an employee claimed confidentiality and intellectual
property agreement as rationale for non-cooperation... Would the
government also go after that employee? Force Apple to discipline or
fire them?
It's gonna be interesting to see how this goes, but I suspect Apple will
cooperate, in secret b/c FISC/A, and do the government's bidding. If
they really can. We may never find out.
Yes, but those phones didn't have the self-destruct code if I remember

It's NOT insubordination if it's NOT your job description. Telling a
coder whose never done anything besides sit at a desk and code they need
to do janitorial tasks for instance.
Telling someone who writes crypto that it's also their job to torture
test it is going to step on the QA director's toes, ya think? If anyone
can be legitimately tasked, it would be the QA department.
It's also dysfunctional to let someone who created the code test it.
That's like letting a machinist who created the part certify it's
Mil-spec 415-D compliance.
Otoh Apple COULD change the job description... IF they want to
re-negotiate the person's salary.
If that person walked I'd speculate there'd be dozens of companies
willing to hire them just because they walked instead of cooperating
with the feds.
The government can't require them to hire anyone.
Further, If the government forces them to add a government paid
contractor or govt employee they could sue for damages caused by
reputation loss with their commercial vendors who buy and sell their
products and material. I'll bet they can easily prove it too! By
charting the DIVE iPhone sales take if they publicly cooperate.
All in all the government demanding a private entity do ANYTHING without
the full force of the law, not JUST some interpretation by the DOJ
backed by some district court hack is a dysfunctional mess that would
tie the government up in court until ios is so fucking obsolete no one
even remembers what it was.
But as I said, as soon as this is out of the news, and Apple has made
enough noise to calm their customers, they'll just do it in secret, as
FISC/A requires. If they can.

A few years ago this guy, a chemical engineer, who worked at a local

because the 'suits' were having too much fun driving their leased

He was looking at a job in the SF Bay area as an engineer at a thin-film

** Law Enforcement Online: Innovative Doesn’t Mean Illegal (
Judith Germano (
Even the Wild West needed a sheriff. And today’s law enforcement agents, to be effective, need more than a Colt .45 and a gold star. Criminal actors have an increasing ability to commit serious crimes remotely via computers, while concealing their identity and location through the use of various means, including Tor hidden service protocols. To effectively identify and apprehend these criminals, law enforcement must be nimble and technologically savvy, and must employ regularly updated investigative tools. These tools include Network Investigative Techniques (NITs), which enable law enforcement (pursuant to court-authorized warrants) to identify the real IP address of web users, regardless of proxy settings. Some NITs also reveal users’ operating systems, CPU architecture, and session identification, and others (pursuant to a Title III or FISA warrant) can allow real-time, full-system monitoring.
There has been some level of controversy recently regarding the FBI’s use of NITs. But as criminals evolve and become increasingly sophisticated through the use of Tor and encryption techniques, so too must law enforcement’s investigative measures evolve, provided they are employed in accordance with lawful procedures and adequate constitutional safeguards.
It was through a NIT that the FBI, in 2015, was able to successfully take down one of the largest dark web child exploitation sites in the world, to apprehend child predators. The site, disturbingly named “Playpen,” provided thousands of pedophiles ( with images of horrifying sexual abuse of children, as well as guidance on how the molesters could avoid being detected. The Playpen site is reported to have had as many as 215,000 accounts within the first year, and an average of 11,000 unique visitors per week. The FBI, pursuant to a court order ( , seized the web host server in North Carolina and, rather than shutting it down immediately, ran it under FBI control for a limited, two-week period. During that time, the FBI used a NIT, which exploited a security vulnerability in the Tor Browser Bundle, to identify more than 1,300 true IP addresses. More, see link at top.

dDos doesn't work over tor very well, if at all. The IRC bot method
employed by that hacked LOIC program was closer to being functional and
secure... assuming no logs would be kept (and the software wasn't
designed to leak info about the usr), which, as can be seen by "Ryan"'s
dox dump of logs from one of the anon IRC servers, was not the case.
The point is to make it's use pervasive and that makes it expensive to
counter, and you BREAK THEM or at least inhibit their ability to go
after anyone but the highest-of-value targets. That's why I support tor
and promote it. Not because it makes one 'invulnerable, but because the
more people who use it, the more impossible it gets for the authorities
to cope. Telling people not to use it actually helps the feds in more
ways than just 'in the clear' comms, and the gubmint's social engineers
who cut tor down for it's insecurities at places like this list know that.

A few years ago when I was still writing news copy for an alt radio news
personality I was personally following the Waxman investigation into
Blackwater. Publicly over the Nisoor Square shooting, but they were
going to cover other issues behind closed doors such as Blackwater's
gun-running  (CPA Glocks w/o serial numbers to Turkish city crime gangs
for a start), which had been followed by McClatchy news service, and I
was using their copy on my blogger posts.
One morning, right before the hearings were about to begin, I was
checking my site counter and discovered a hit from PentagonMil on one of
those posts... What? Me worry?
But what followed next should disturbing to anyone who thought the feds
understood infosec or had someone on payroll who understands.
Apparently the person who viewed it first saved it to their desktop
complete with the site counter jscript, and the next few hits after
that, instead of showing a typical http path, showed the path through
pentagonmil to the desktop names of people the original viewer had
passed the page around to. The pentagon was letting my saved blog page
'phone home'. They hadn't blocked outgoing script action.

It might fit in the QA end of the biz. Someone has to test security.
Whether your agreement with the company allows them to 'contract' you to
a 3rd party's task... I REALLY doubt it judging from my industrial end
(drive manufacturing) experience. They're really REALLY concerned about
letting any information about the creation of the product out of their
grasp. It probably violates you confidentiality and intellectual
property agreement with the company.
Can the government make you violate that agreement? Can they make Apple
change it's agreement with you? Can the government force you to change a
worker's job description or hire/accept a government contract worker or
Iow, tell you how to run your business...
Dunno. But IF an employee claimed confidentiality and intellectual
property agreement as rationale for non-cooperation... Would the
government also go after that employee? Force Apple to discipline or
fire them?
It's gonna be interesting to see how this goes, but I suspect Apple will
cooperate, in secret b/c FISC/A, and do the government's bidding. If
they really can. We may never find out.
Yes, but those phones didn't have the self-destruct code if I remember

It's NOT insubordination if it's NOT your job description. Telling a
coder whose never done anything besides sit at a desk and code they need
to do janitorial tasks for instance.
Telling someone who writes crypto that it's also their job to torture
test it is going to step on the QA director's toes, ya think? If anyone
can be legitimately tasked, it would be the QA department.
It's also dysfunctional to let someone who created the code test it.
That's like letting a machinist who created the part certify it's
Mil-spec 415-D compliance.
Otoh Apple COULD change the job description... IF they want to
re-negotiate the person's salary.
If that person walked I'd speculate there'd be dozens of companies
willing to hire them just because they walked instead of cooperating
with the feds.
The government can't require them to hire anyone.
Further, If the government forces them to add a government paid
contractor or govt employee they could sue for damages caused by
reputation loss with their commercial vendors who buy and sell their
products and material. I'll bet they can easily prove it too! By
charting the DIVE iPhone sales take if they publicly cooperate.
All in all the government demanding a private entity do ANYTHING without
the full force of the law, not JUST some interpretation by the DOJ
backed by some district court hack is a dysfunctional mess that would
tie the government up in court until ios is so fucking obsolete no one
even remembers what it was.
But as I said, as soon as this is out of the news, and Apple has made
enough noise to calm their customers, they'll just do it in secret, as
FISC/A requires. If they can.

A few years ago this guy, a chemical engineer, who worked at a local

because the 'suits' were having too much fun driving their leased

He was looking at a job in the SF Bay area as an engineer at a thin-film

I still think it's a med reaction exacerbated by his run in with the
SFPD. What I'd really like to have examined is a toxicology report for
Murdock, due to his repeated erratic behavior the SFPD 'intervened' in.
You'd think they'd do such a thing, but I suspect not.
At one point in my younger days I personally knew Abbie Hoffman. Later
in life, and  at the other end of the US I had a hard time believing the
story of his suicide having always noted his maniac side but never
seeing the 'down side' of his personality. I broached that on a list
where someone who knew him a lot better than me posts and he went and
asked Abbie's brother-in-law Wally, from his first marriage to Anita
The response from Wally was an eyeopener. Apparently Abbie was not in
very good health and had about 95% arterial blockage. Then he was
feeling under the weather so the doctors prescribed Prozac for him,
unknowing at the time that the combination of arterial blockage and
prozac causes suicidal thoughts and tendencies.
I suspect something similar happened to Ian Murdock, and the SFPD was
involved, and crudely so, but unless the 'abrasions' to his head that
needed stitches were severe enough to have caused his demise or
exacerbated a pre-existing head injury or unknown such as potential for
cerebral hemorrhage (again, this could be due to prescription meds), it

Plain text and html...
On September 5, 2013, The Guardian
the /New York Times
 /jointly
reported — based on documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden —
that the National Security Agency had compromised some of the encryption
that is most commonly used to secure internet transactions. The
encryption, or digital scrambling, that guards global commerce and
banking systems, protects sensitive data like trade secrets and medical
records, and automatically secures the emails, web searches, internet
chats and phone calls of Americans and others around the world.” One
2010 memo described that “for the past decade, NSA has led an
aggressive, multipronged effort to break widely used internet encryption
In support of the reporting, all three papers published redacted
portions of documents from the NSA along with its British counterpart,
GCHQ. Prior to publication of the story, the NSA vehemently argued that
any reporting of any kind on this program would jeopardize national
security by alerting terrorists to the fact that encryption products had
been successfully compromised. After the stories were published, U.S.
officials aggressively attacked
the newspapers for endangering national security and helping terrorists
with these revelations.
All three newspapers reporting this story rejected those arguments prior
to publication and decided to report the encryption-cracking successes.
Then-/NYT/ Executive Editor Jill Abramson described
the decision to publish as “not a particularly anguished one” in light
of the public interest in knowing about this program, and /ProPublica/
editors published a lengthy explanation
 along
with the story justifying their decision.
All three outlets, while reporting the anti-encryption efforts, redacted
portions of the documents they published or described. One redaction in
particular, found in the /NYT /documents
from the FY 2013 “black budget,” proved to be especially controversial
among tech and security experts, as they believed that the specific
identity of compromised encryption standards was being concealed by the
None of the documents in the Snowden archive identify all or even most
of the encryption standards that had been targeted, and there was a
concern that if an attempt were made to identify one or two of them, it
could mislead the public into believing that the others were safe. There
also seemed to be a concern among some editors that any attempt to
identify specific encryption standards would enable terrorists to know
which ones to avoid. One redaction in particular, from the /NYT/, was
designed to strike this balance and was the one that became most
The issue of this specific redaction was raised

a backdoor found on Juniper systems, followed by /The Intercept/’s
that the NSA and GCHQ had targeted Juniper. In light of that news, we
examined the documents referenced by those 2013 articles with particular
attention to that controversial redaction, and decided that it was
warranted to un-redact that passage. It reads as follows:
The reference to “the two leading encryption chips” provides some hints,
but no definitive proof, as to which ones were successfully targeted.
Matthew Green, a cryptography expert at Johns Hopkins, declined to
speculate on which companies this might reference. But he said that “the
damage has already been done. From what I’ve heard, many foreign
purchasers have already begun to look at all U.S.-manufactured
encryption technology with a much more skeptical eye as a result of what
the NSA has done. That’s too bad, because I suspect only a minority of
products have been compromised this way.”
NSA requested until 5 p.m. today to respond but then failed to do
so. (/Update/: The NSA subsequently emailed to say: “It would be
accurate to state that NSA declined to comment.”)

@_author: Rayzer 
@_subject: [addenda] A Redaction Re-Visited: NSA Targeted ... 
For those too lazy to look it up here's some speculation from
Greenwald's IAMA October 31 2013.
Again, plain text and html:
While I do not know the name redacted in that report, the "VPN and Web
encryption devices" mentioned are most likely hardware SSL acceleration
appliances [1] , and due
to the sensitive nature of the backdoor being discussed, are probably in
chips fabricated by a US-based silicon designer using a US-located
silicon fabrication plant.
The reason for that is twofold; first, you don't want a foreign power
discovering your backdoor in a chip, and second, you don't want a
foreign power inserting their own backdoor.
The vendors [2]
list in Wikipedia lists the following vendors of SSL appliances:
  * Barracuda Networks
  * Array Networks
  * CAI Networks
  * Cavium Networks (fabless semiconductor designer)
  * Cisco Systems
  * Citrix Systems
  * Cotendo
  * Coyote point systems
  * Crescendo Networks
  * Exinda
  * F5 Networks
  * Foundry Networks
  * Forum Systems
  * Freescale Semiconductor (fabless and fab-owning)
  * Hifn
  * IBM (fab-owning)
  * Interface Masters Technologies
  * jetNEXUS
  * Juniper Networks
  * Nortel Networks
  * Radware
  * Riverbed Technology
  * Strangeloop Networks
  * Sun Microsystems
Of those, the two names that stand out most are IBM (which is no
stranger to crippling encryption upon the demands of the NSA, with
fabrication plants throughout the world and the United States, but which
isn't significantly given to florid chip descriptors) and Freescale
Semiconductors - it is itself a large semiconductor fabricator, focused
on semiconductor fabrication, with foundries in Chandler, AZ and Oak
Hill, TX.
One not mentioned in that list is Broadcom, a semiconductor manufacturer
that is /fabless/, that is - it doesn't own any fabrication capability,
itself. It does, however, design a very large percentage of
communications chips used in the industry. Not finding a Broadcom chip
somewhere in a device is notable.
The redacted space is roughly twelve all-caps letters or sixteen
mixed-case letters in that font. If we could have someone identify
exactly which font was used, then we could experiment with chip names
from SSL acceleration device manifests, in that font, and see which fit
into the redacted space, possibly with the manufacturer's name in front
of the chip - for example, the Freescale SAHARA
appears to fit nicely - and is touted as having configurable access
control to the random number generator and hashing functions on that
feature sheet linked - but is just one possibility. Another is the
PowerArchitecture™ from Mocana -formerly FreeScale
[4] .
If I were in the position to lead a project to reverse-engineer the
possible name of the chip, I would:
  * Find out what the top five top-selling SSL acceleration device
    manufacturers in the world are;
  * get a list of their best-selling products;
  * Get parts manifests for each of their popular products, possibly
    from an electronics tear down research organisation;
  * Locate and name the crypto accelerator chips;
  * Determine who designed and fabricated those chips.
  * Get the name of the font used in the report in the imgur link;
  * Compose the name of each of those chips in that font at that pitch;
  * Do a little comparing.
While that is /possible/, it is equally as likely that one variety or
species of chip is being named! i.e. /Intel Pentium chips/. There is
also no guarantee that the redacted text lists a florid,
marketing-friendly name, and may possibly be a code name internal to the
US intelligence community. These and other alternatives should not be

Not JUST FOIAs.
Fixing Pre-Publication Review: What Should Be Done?
By Steven Aftergood
Friday, January 15, 2016 at 9:15 AM
Jack Goldsmith and Oona Hathaway called attention in several recent
columns to the pre-publication review process (here, here, here, and
here) that many current and former national security officials and other
government employees must submit to before their work can be published.
The process, they argued, has become dysfunctional, overstepping
legitimate national security boundaries and infringing on freedom of
speech as well as the public’s right to know.
Their case is strong.
Among many pertinent examples, the experience of former Army Reserve
officer Anthony Shaffer is particularly instructive. After he wrote a
memoir of his Afghan war experience, Shaffer submitted his manuscript to
the Army for review, as required, and the approved text was printed. But
then the Defense Intelligence Agency intervened and objected that in its
estimation the cleared volume still contained classified information.
Publication was halted, and the Department of Defense was obliged to
purchase and pulp thousands of copies of the book, although numerous
publicity copies had already been released. A new version of the book
with the objectionable words and passages blacked out was finally
published for sale. (Shaffer presented his version of events in a First
Amendment lawsuit he brought in 2010, with very limited success.)
What makes the Shaffer case valuable in this context is that both the
pre- and post-publication review versions of his text entered public
circulation, permitting external scrutiny of the deletions required by
the official reviewers. In nearly every case, the redacted words and
passages seem to be devoid of national security sensitivity, as the Army
itself had originally concluded.
The most frequent redaction is the cover name that the author used while
serving in Afghanistan, “Christopher Stryker.” Also commonly deleted are
references to the National Security Agency, its headquarters location in
Fort Meade, Maryland, and the use of the term “SIGINT” (signals
intelligence). Somewhat more plausibly, the identity of the former CIA
chief of station in Kabul was replaced with a pseudonym. But rather less
plausibly, a passing mention of the name of character actor Ned Beatty
was deleted.
The point, in other words, is that there is an empirical foundation for
the belief that pre-publication review has gone off the rails. As it is
conducted today, the review process too often arbitrarily impedes the
freedom of many US government employees to participate in public discourse.

Just Security's editor:
This post is the latest installment of our “Monday Reflections” feature,
in which a different Just Security editor examines the big stories from
the previous week or looks ahead to key developments on the horizon.
The end of 2015 brought a flurry of announcements from tech companies,
including Facebook, Yahoo, and Microsoft, promising to notify their
users if the company believes that state-sponsored actors are targeting
the users’ accounts. These state-sponsored-attacker notifications share
features of other kinds of attributions. On the one hand, like the
Mandiant report and other reports by cybersecurity companies
highlighting state-sponsored cyberintrusions, private companies are
responsible for the attribution. On the other hand, like the limited
evidentiary disclosures made by the US government in attributing the
Sony Pictures hack to North Korea, the companies withhold the
evidentiary basis for the notifications in order to protect their
detection methods and avoid tipping off attackers.
The notifications contribute to evolving debates about the requisite
evidentiary basis for attribution of state-sponsored
cyberattacks—debates over types of evidence, amounts of evidence, and
levels of public disclosure that should be required for attribution in
different contexts. The notifications also show that while standards of
evidence for attribution are discussed in multilateral fora like the
United Nations, states are not the only parties whose practice matters.
Company Notifications
Google pioneered notifications to users about state-sponsored attacks in
2012. The company explained in a blog post at the time that in response
to “specific intelligence—either directly from users or from [its] own
monitoring efforts”—it would display a banner stating “Warning: We
believe state-sponsored attackers may be attempting to compromise your
account or computer.”
Facebook made a similar announcement in October 2015. In a blog post by
Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, Facebook explained that it would
show users a warning if the company has “a strong suspicion that an
attack could be government-sponsored.” According to the New York Times,
in the wake of the Iranian nuclear deal and “[j]ust weeks into the new
[Facebook] alert system,” numerous State Department officials who work
on Iran and the Middle East received notifications that their accounts
had been targeted by a state-sponsored actor.
In mid-December, Twitter, which had not previously announced a policy on
state-sponsored attacks, notified some users that their accounts “may
have been targeted by state-sponsored actors,” who were “trying to
obtain information such as email addresses, IP addresses, and/or phone
numbers.” (A copy a notification sent to another user is available here.)
On December 21, Yahoo Chief Information Security Officer Bob Lord
announced that “Yahoo will now notify you if we strongly suspect that
your account may have been targeted by a state-sponsored actor.”
Microsoft followed suit on December 30, announcing in a blog post by
Corporate Vice President for Trustworthy Computing Scott Charney that
Microsoft “will now notify you if we believe your account has been
targeted or compromised by an individual or group working on behalf of a
nation state.”
According to the companies, they issue notifications for state-sponsored
attackers in particular because, as Facebook explains, “these types of
attacks tend to be more advanced and dangerous than others.” The
notifications are intended to prompt users to better secure their
account with the notifying company and other online accounts by, for
example, enabling two-step verification, changing passwords, and
monitoring for unusual activity.
Similarities to and Differences From Other Attributions to Nation-States
The state-sponsored-attacker notifications share similarities with prior
attributions by both the private sector and the US government. On the
one hand, the notifications (and the attributions supporting them) are
done by private companies, like the reports on state-sponsored
intrusions issued by cybersecurity companies like Mandiant and
Crowdstrike that I discussed in an earlier post.
On the other hand, unlike the extensive technical details that often
accompany such reports (see, for example, the Mandiant APT1 report), the
state-sponsored-attacker notifications do not come with evidence to back
up the attribution. Google’s post on the notifications explains: “You
might ask how we know this activity is state-sponsored. We can’t go into
the details without giving away information that would be helpful to
these bad actors, but our detailed analysis—as well as victim
reports—strongly suggest the involvement of states or groups that are
state-sponsored.” Facebook’s post similarly states, “To protect the
integrity of our methods and processes, we often won’t be able to
explain how we attribute certain attacks to suspected attackers.” The
invocation of secrecy to protect “methods and processes” echoes similar
statements made by the FBI in announcing the attribution of the Sony
Pictures hack to North Korea. The FBI press release explained that the
“need to protect sensitive sources and methods” prevented the Bureau
from sharing details of its evidence against North Korea. The FBI
provided a general description of the evidence supporting the
attribution, including, for example, “significant overlap between the
infrastructure used in this attack and other malicious cyber activity
the U.S. government has previously linked directly to North Korea.” But
the lack of detailed information triggered significant skepticism within
the security community, prompting FBI Director James Comey to release
additional information several weeks later.
Unlike the other types of attribution, the state-sponsored-attacker
notifications do not name the state involved. They simply inform a user
that some “state-sponsored actor” has targeted the user’s account. Of
course, upon receipt of a notification, some users may have a pretty
good idea which state is targeting them, and the pattern of accounts
targeted may reveal the state’s identity to the company or to the public
if/when the notifications become public. That may be what happened with
the Facebook notifications to State Department employees discussed
above. Still, the notifications’ failure to name the particular state
involved renders them somewhat less accusatory than attributions that
name a specific state...

@_subject: Drivers Licenses? We Don' Need No Steekin' Licenses 
*The Decline of the Driver's License*
Julie Beck Jan 22, 2016, The Atlantic
Remember how, in /Clueless, /Alicia Silverstone’s character Cher fails
her driver’s test after nearly killing a biker and scraping her car
alongside several parked cars? And then how she asks, “Do you think I
should write them a note?” as she drives away? And then how, at the
climax of the movie, her friend Tai (Brittany Murphy) calls her “a
virgin who can’t drive ”
and it is just the harshest burn?
Well, that was a fictionalized version of the ‘90s, and this is now.
Things are different.
Young people are not getting driver’s licenses so much anymore. In fact,
no one is. According to a new study
by Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle at the University of Michigan
Transportation Research Institute, the percentage of people with a
driver’s license decreased between 2011 and 2014, across all age groups.
For people aged 16 to 44, that percentage has been decreasing steadily since 1983.
It’s especially pronounced for the teens—in 2014, just 24.5 percent of
16-year-olds had a license, a 47-percent decrease from 1983, when 46.2
percent did. And at the tail end of the teen years, 69 percent of
19-year-olds had licenses in 2014, compared to 87.3 percent in 1983, a
21-percent decrease.
Among young adults, the declines are smaller but still significant—16.4
percent fewer 20-to-24-year-olds had licenses in 2014 than in 1983, 11
percent fewer 25-to-29-year-olds, 10.3 percent fewer 30-to-34-year-olds,
and 7.4 percent fewer 35-to-39-year-olds. For people between 40 and 54,
the declines were small, less than 5 percent.
Above 55, the story’s a little different. Older adults were more likely
to have a driver’s license in 2014 than in 1983—in the case of those 70
and older, 43.6 percent more likely. But these age groups, too, saw a
modest decline from 2011 to 2014.
The researchers didn’t look into what the reasons for this decline might
be, but in an earlier study, they surveyed
adults ages 18 to 39 without driver’s licenses about why they don’t have
them. The top three reasons were: “too busy or not enough time to get a
driver’s license” (37 percent), “owning and maintaining a vehicle is too
expensive”(32 percent), and “able to get transportation from others” (31
Another reason that springs to mind is that more people are living in
cities and using public transportation. But in the survey, only 17
percent said their reason for not having a license was that they
preferred public transit.
In other studies, Sivak and Schoettle suggest that driving in general
may have already peaked in the United States. The total distance driven
per person in the U.S. was at its highest in 2004, and by 2013, it had
decreased by 9 percent. In part, this may be because people are
traveling less in general: Comparing 2004 to 2014, people spent less
time traveling to places to eat and drink, to buy goods and services, to
work, school, and to leisure activities. The ease of Amazon, the rise of
teleworking, and the endless entertainment provided by the Internet may
be leading people to stay home more, but it’s hard to say—there’s no
research available that explains these trends. A /New York Times article
from 2013 mentions unemployment as a reason for young people buying
fewer cars, but as Jordan Weissman noted in /The Atlantic/
that same year, downward trends in driving started before the recession.
Maybe it’s just that people today have more things they’d rather do than
practice parallel parking between traffic cones. Or maybe it’s because
the photos on those plastic cards are almost never flattering. Sivak and
Schoettle are hoping to soon study possible reasons for the drop in
driver’s licenses. But regardless of the cause, it seems that if you
want to insult a teen today, shaming them for not being able to operate
a motor vehicle might not be the way to go.

I still think it's a med reaction exacerbated by his run in with the
SFPD. What I'd really like to have examined is a toxicology report for
Murdock, due to his repeated erratic behavior the SFPD 'intervened' in.
You'd think they'd do such a thing, but I suspect not.
At one point in my younger days I personally knew Abbie Hoffman. Later
in life, and  at the other end of the US I had a hard time believing the
story of his suicide having always noted his maniac side but never
seeing the 'down side' of his personality. I broached that on a list
where someone who knew him a lot better than me posts and he went and
asked Abbie's brother-in-law Wally, from his first marriage to Anita
The response from Wally was an eyeopener. Apparently Abbie was not in
very good health and had about 95% arterial blockage. Then he was
feeling under the weather so the doctors prescribed Prozac for him,
unknowing at the time that the combination of arterial blockage and
prozac causes suicidal thoughts and tendencies.
I suspect something similar happened to Ian Murdock, and the SFPD was
involved, and crudely so, but unless the 'abrasions' to his head that
needed stitches were severe enough to have caused his demise or
exacerbated a pre-existing head injury or unknown such as potential for
cerebral hemorrhage (again, this could be due to prescription meds), it
just another instance of the police as insensitive abusive
bureaucrats-with-guns ham-handly 'dealing' with a citizen, booking and
releasing him.

Plain text and html...
On September 5, 2013, The Guardian
the /New York Times
 /jointly
reported — based on documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden —
that the National Security Agency had compromised some of the encryption
that is most commonly used to secure internet transactions. The
encryption, or digital scrambling, that guards global commerce and
banking systems, protects sensitive data like trade secrets and medical
records, and automatically secures the emails, web searches, internet
chats and phone calls of Americans and others around the world.” One
2010 memo described that “for the past decade, NSA has led an
aggressive, multipronged effort to break widely used internet encryption
In support of the reporting, all three papers published redacted
portions of documents from the NSA along with its British counterpart,
GCHQ. Prior to publication of the story, the NSA vehemently argued that
any reporting of any kind on this program would jeopardize national
security by alerting terrorists to the fact that encryption products had
been successfully compromised. After the stories were published, U.S.
officials aggressively attacked
the newspapers for endangering national security and helping terrorists
with these revelations.
All three newspapers reporting this story rejected those arguments prior
to publication and decided to report the encryption-cracking successes.
Then-/NYT/ Executive Editor Jill Abramson described
the decision to publish as “not a particularly anguished one” in light
of the public interest in knowing about this program, and /ProPublica/
editors published a lengthy explanation
 along
with the story justifying their decision.
All three outlets, while reporting the anti-encryption efforts, redacted
portions of the documents they published or described. One redaction in
particular, found in the /NYT /documents
from the FY 2013 “black budget,” proved to be especially controversial
among tech and security experts, as they believed that the specific
identity of compromised encryption standards was being concealed by the
None of the documents in the Snowden archive identify all or even most
of the encryption standards that had been targeted, and there was a
concern that if an attempt were made to identify one or two of them, it
could mislead the public into believing that the others were safe. There
also seemed to be a concern among some editors that any attempt to
identify specific encryption standards would enable terrorists to know
which ones to avoid. One redaction in particular, from the /NYT/, was
designed to strike this balance and was the one that became most
The issue of this specific redaction was raised
 again
 by
security researchers last month
 in the wake of
 of
a backdoor found on Juniper systems, followed by /The Intercept/’s
that the NSA and GCHQ had targeted Juniper. In light of that news, we
examined the documents referenced by those 2013 articles with particular
attention to that controversial redaction, and decided that it was
warranted to un-redact that passage. It reads as follows:
The reference to “the two leading encryption chips” provides some hints,
but no definitive proof, as to which ones were successfully targeted.
Matthew Green, a cryptography expert at Johns Hopkins, declined to
speculate on which companies this might reference. But he said that “the
damage has already been done. From what I’ve heard, many foreign
purchasers have already begun to look at all U.S.-manufactured
encryption technology with a much more skeptical eye as a result of what
the NSA has done. That’s too bad, because I suspect only a minority of
products have been compromised this way.”
NSA requested until 5 p.m. today to respond but then failed to do
so. (/Update/: The NSA subsequently emailed to say: “It would be
accurate to state that NSA declined to comment.”)

For those too lazy to look it up here's some speculation from
Greenwald's IAMA October 31 2013.
Again, plain text and html:
While I do not know the name redacted in that report, the "VPN and Web
encryption devices" mentioned are most likely hardware SSL acceleration
appliances [1] , and due
to the sensitive nature of the backdoor being discussed, are probably in
chips fabricated by a US-based silicon designer using a US-located
silicon fabrication plant.
The reason for that is twofold; first, you don't want a foreign power
discovering your backdoor in a chip, and second, you don't want a
foreign power inserting their own backdoor.
The vendors [2]
list in Wikipedia lists the following vendors of SSL appliances:
  * Barracuda Networks
  * Array Networks
  * CAI Networks
  * Cavium Networks (fabless semiconductor designer)
  * Cisco Systems
  * Citrix Systems

Of those, the two names that stand out most are IBM (which is no
stranger to crippling encryption upon the demands of the NSA, with
fabrication plants throughout the world and the United States, but which
isn't significantly given to florid chip descriptors) and Freescale
Semiconductors - it is itself a large semiconductor fabricator, focused
on semiconductor fabrication, with foundries in Chandler, AZ and Oak
Hill, TX.
One not mentioned in that list is Broadcom, a semiconductor manufacturer
that is /fabless/, that is - it doesn't own any fabrication capability,
itself. It does, however, design a very large percentage of
communications chips used in the industry. Not finding a Broadcom chip
somewhere in a device is notable.
The redacted space is roughly twelve all-caps letters or sixteen
mixed-case letters in that font. If we could have someone identify
exactly which font was used, then we could experiment with chip names
from SSL acceleration device manifests, in that font, and see which fit
into the redacted space, possibly with the manufacturer's name in front
of the chip - for example, the Freescale SAHARA
appears to fit nicely - and is touted as having configurable access
control to the random number generator and hashing functions on that
feature sheet linked - but is just one possibility. Another is the
PowerArchitecture™ from Mocana -formerly FreeScale
[4] .
If I were in the position to lead a project to reverse-engineer the
possible name of the chip, I would:
  * Find out what the top five top-selling SSL acceleration device
    manufacturers in the world are;
  * get a list of their best-selling products;
  * Get parts manifests for each of their popular products, possibly
    from an electronics tear down research organisation;
  * Locate and name the crypto accelerator chips;
  * Determine who designed and fabricated those chips.
  * Get the name of the font used in the report in the imgur link;
  * Compose the name of each of those chips in that font at that pitch;
  * Do a little comparing.
While that is /possible/, it is equally as likely that one variety or
species of chip is being named! i.e. /Intel Pentium chips/. There is
also no guarantee that the redacted text lists a florid,
marketing-friendly name, and may possibly be a code name internal to the
US intelligence community. These and other alternatives should not be

Not JUST FOIAs.
Fixing Pre-Publication Review: What Should Be Done?
By Steven Aftergood
Friday, January 15, 2016 at 9:15 AM
Jack Goldsmith and Oona Hathaway called attention in several recent
columns to the pre-publication review process (here, here, here, and
here) that many current and former national security officials and other
government employees must submit to before their work can be published.
The process, they argued, has become dysfunctional, overstepping
legitimate national security boundaries and infringing on freedom of
speech as well as the public’s right to know.
Their case is strong.
Among many pertinent examples, the experience of former Army Reserve
officer Anthony Shaffer is particularly instructive. After he wrote a
memoir of his Afghan war experience, Shaffer submitted his manuscript to
the Army for review, as required, and the approved text was printed. But
then the Defense Intelligence Agency intervened and objected that in its
estimation the cleared volume still contained classified information.
Publication was halted, and the Department of Defense was obliged to
purchase and pulp thousands of copies of the book, although numerous
publicity copies had already been released. A new version of the book
with the objectionable words and passages blacked out was finally
published for sale. (Shaffer presented his version of events in a First
Amendment lawsuit he brought in 2010, with very limited success.)
What makes the Shaffer case valuable in this context is that both the
pre- and post-publication review versions of his text entered public
circulation, permitting external scrutiny of the deletions required by
the official reviewers. In nearly every case, the redacted words and
passages seem to be devoid of national security sensitivity, as the Army
itself had originally concluded.
The most frequent redaction is the cover name that the author used while
serving in Afghanistan, “Christopher Stryker.” Also commonly deleted are
references to the National Security Agency, its headquarters location in
Fort Meade, Maryland, and the use of the term “SIGINT” (signals
intelligence). Somewhat more plausibly, the identity of the former CIA
chief of station in Kabul was replaced with a pseudonym. But rather less
plausibly, a passing mention of the name of character actor Ned Beatty
was deleted.
The point, in other words, is that there is an empirical foundation for
the belief that pre-publication review has gone off the rails. As it is
conducted today, the review process too often arbitrarily impedes the
freedom of many US government employees to participate in public discourse.

Just Security's editor:
This post is the latest installment of our “Monday Reflections” feature,
in which a different Just Security editor examines the big stories from
the previous week or looks ahead to key developments on the horizon.
The end of 2015 brought a flurry of announcements from tech companies,
including Facebook, Yahoo, and Microsoft, promising to notify their
users if the company believes that state-sponsored actors are targeting
the users’ accounts. These state-sponsored-attacker notifications share
features of other kinds of attributions. On the one hand, like the
Mandiant report and other reports by cybersecurity companies
highlighting state-sponsored cyberintrusions, private companies are
responsible for the attribution. On the other hand, like the limited
evidentiary disclosures made by the US government in attributing the
Sony Pictures hack to North Korea, the companies withhold the
evidentiary basis for the notifications in order to protect their
detection methods and avoid tipping off attackers.
The notifications contribute to evolving debates about the requisite
evidentiary basis for attribution of state-sponsored
cyberattacks—debates over types of evidence, amounts of evidence, and
levels of public disclosure that should be required for attribution in
different contexts. The notifications also show that while standards of
evidence for attribution are discussed in multilateral fora like the
United Nations, states are not the only parties whose practice matters.
Company Notifications
Google pioneered notifications to users about state-sponsored attacks in
2012. The company explained in a blog post at the time that in response
to “specific intelligence—either directly from users or from [its] own
monitoring efforts”—it would display a banner stating “Warning: We
believe state-sponsored attackers may be attempting to compromise your
account or computer.”
Facebook made a similar announcement in October 2015. In a blog post by
Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, Facebook explained that it would
show users a warning if the company has “a strong suspicion that an
attack could be government-sponsored.” According to the New York Times,
in the wake of the Iranian nuclear deal and “[j]ust weeks into the new
[Facebook] alert system,” numerous State Department officials who work
on Iran and the Middle East received notifications that their accounts
had been targeted by a state-sponsored actor.
In mid-December, Twitter, which had not previously announced a policy on
state-sponsored attacks, notified some users that their accounts “may
have been targeted by state-sponsored actors,” who were “trying to
obtain information such as email addresses, IP addresses, and/or phone
numbers.” (A copy a notification sent to another user is available here.)
On December 21, Yahoo Chief Information Security Officer Bob Lord
announced that “Yahoo will now notify you if we strongly suspect that
your account may have been targeted by a state-sponsored actor.”
Microsoft followed suit on December 30, announcing in a blog post by
Corporate Vice President for Trustworthy Computing Scott Charney that
Microsoft “will now notify you if we believe your account has been
targeted or compromised by an individual or group working on behalf of a
nation state.”
According to the companies, they issue notifications for state-sponsored
attackers in particular because, as Facebook explains, “these types of
attacks tend to be more advanced and dangerous than others.” The
notifications are intended to prompt users to better secure their
account with the notifying company and other online accounts by, for
example, enabling two-step verification, changing passwords, and
monitoring for unusual activity.
Similarities to and Differences From Other Attributions to Nation-States
The state-sponsored-attacker notifications share similarities with prior
attributions by both the private sector and the US government. On the
one hand, the notifications (and the attributions supporting them) are
done by private companies, like the reports on state-sponsored
intrusions issued by cybersecurity companies like Mandiant and
Crowdstrike that I discussed in an earlier post.
On the other hand, unlike the extensive technical details that often
accompany such reports (see, for example, the Mandiant APT1 report), the
state-sponsored-attacker notifications do not come with evidence to back
up the attribution. Google’s post on the notifications explains: “You
might ask how we know this activity is state-sponsored. We can’t go into
the details without giving away information that would be helpful to
these bad actors, but our detailed analysis—as well as victim
reports—strongly suggest the involvement of states or groups that are
state-sponsored.” Facebook’s post similarly states, “To protect the
integrity of our methods and processes, we often won’t be able to
explain how we attribute certain attacks to suspected attackers.” The
invocation of secrecy to protect “methods and processes” echoes similar
statements made by the FBI in announcing the attribution of the Sony
Pictures hack to North Korea. The FBI press release explained that the
“need to protect sensitive sources and methods” prevented the Bureau
from sharing details of its evidence against North Korea. The FBI
provided a general description of the evidence supporting the
attribution, including, for example, “significant overlap between the
infrastructure used in this attack and other malicious cyber activity
the U.S. government has previously linked directly to North Korea.” But
the lack of detailed information triggered significant skepticism within
the security community, prompting FBI Director James Comey to release
additional information several weeks later.
Unlike the other types of attribution, the state-sponsored-attacker
notifications do not name the state involved. They simply inform a user
that some “state-sponsored actor” has targeted the user’s account. Of
course, upon receipt of a notification, some users may have a pretty
good idea which state is targeting them, and the pattern of accounts
targeted may reveal the state’s identity to the company or to the public
if/when the notifications become public. That may be what happened with
the Facebook notifications to State Department employees discussed
above. Still, the notifications’ failure to name the particular state
involved renders them somewhat less accusatory than attributions that
name a specific state...

@_subject: Drivers Licenses? We Don' Need No Steekin' Licenses 
*The Decline of the Driver's License*
Julie Beck Jan 22, 2016, The Atlantic
Remember how, in /Clueless, /Alicia Silverstone’s character Cher fails
her driver’s test after nearly killing a biker and scraping her car
alongside several parked cars? And then how she asks, “Do you think I
should write them a note?” as she drives away? And then how, at the
climax of the movie, her friend Tai (Brittany Murphy) calls her “a
virgin who can’t drive ”
and it is just the harshest burn?
Well, that was a fictionalized version of the ‘90s, and this is now.
Things are different.
Young people are not getting driver’s licenses so much anymore. In fact,
no one is. According to a new study
by Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle at the University of Michigan
Transportation Research Institute, the percentage of people with a
driver’s license decreased between 2011 and 2014, across all age groups.
For people aged 16 to 44, that percentage has been decreasing steadily since 1983.
It’s especially pronounced for the teens—in 2014, just 24.5 percent of
16-year-olds had a license, a 47-percent decrease from 1983, when 46.2
percent did. And at the tail end of the teen years, 69 percent of
19-year-olds had licenses in 2014, compared to 87.3 percent in 1983, a
21-percent decrease.
Among young adults, the declines are smaller but still significant—16.4
percent fewer 20-to-24-year-olds had licenses in 2014 than in 1983, 11
percent fewer 25-to-29-year-olds, 10.3 percent fewer 30-to-34-year-olds,
and 7.4 percent fewer 35-to-39-year-olds. For people between 40 and 54,
the declines were small, less than 5 percent.
Above 55, the story’s a little different. Older adults were more likely
to have a driver’s license in 2014 than in 1983—in the case of those 70
and older, 43.6 percent more likely. But these age groups, too, saw a
modest decline from 2011 to 2014.
The researchers didn’t look into what the reasons for this decline might
be, but in an earlier study, they surveyed
adults ages 18 to 39 without driver’s licenses about why they don’t have
them. The top three reasons were: “too busy or not enough time to get a
driver’s license” (37 percent), “owning and maintaining a vehicle is too
expensive”(32 percent), and “able to get transportation from others” (31
Another reason that springs to mind is that more people are living in
cities and using public transportation. But in the survey, only 17
percent said their reason for not having a license was that they
preferred public transit.
In other studies, Sivak and Schoettle suggest that driving in general
may have already peaked in the United States. The total distance driven
per person in the U.S. was at its highest in 2004, and by 2013, it had
decreased by 9 percent. In part, this may be because people are
traveling less in general: Comparing 2004 to 2014, people spent less
time traveling to places to eat and drink, to buy goods and services, to
work, school, and to leisure activities. The ease of Amazon, the rise of
teleworking, and the endless entertainment provided by the Internet may
be leading people to stay home more, but it’s hard to say—there’s no
research available that explains these trends. A /New York Times article
from 2013 mentions unemployment as a reason for young people buying
fewer cars, but as Jordan Weissman noted in /The Atlantic/
that same year, downward trends in driving started before the recession.
Maybe it’s just that people today have more things they’d rather do than
practice parallel parking between traffic cones. Or maybe it’s because
the photos on those plastic cards are almost never flattering. Sivak and
Schoettle are hoping to soon study possible reasons for the drop in
driver’s licenses. But regardless of the cause, it seems that if you
want to insult a teen today, shaming them for not being able to operate
a motor vehicle might not be the way to go.

Every society is a collective. Fascist societies maintain their
collective structure by emotional, psychological, and physically
destructive methods. In any legitimate anarchist collective society if
you don't fit somewhere, that's ok... You don't have to.
What Ben Morea of Up Against the Wall (Motherfuckers) said about the
Situationists and other anarchist cells for example:
You don't hear this sort of thing from intrinsically Fascist formations
on the left like the SWP or Revolutionary Workers Party, they're too
busy snitching each other off to the police or engaging in
informant/provocateur activities themselves.

I still think it's a med reaction exacerbated by his run in with the
SFPD. What I'd really like to have examined is a toxicology report for
Murdock, due to his repeated erratic behavior the SFPD 'intervened' in.
You'd think they'd do such a thing, but I suspect not.
At one point in my younger days I personally knew Abbie Hoffman. Later
in life, and  at the other end of the US I had a hard time believing the
story of his suicide having always noted his maniac side but never
seeing the 'down side' of his personality. I broached that on a list
where someone who knew him a lot better than me posts and he went and
asked Abbie's brother-in-law Wally, from his first marriage to Anita
The response from Wally was an eyeopener. Apparently Abbie was not in
very good health and had about 95% arterial blockage. Then he was
feeling under the weather so the doctors prescribed Prozac for him,
unknowing at the time that the combination of arterial blockage and
prozac causes suicidal thoughts and tendencies.
I suspect something similar happened to Ian Murdock, and the SFPD was
involved, and crudely so, but unless the 'abrasions' to his head that
needed stitches were severe enough to have caused his demise or
exacerbated a pre-existing head injury or unknown such as potential for
cerebral hemorrhage (again, this could be due to prescription meds), it

Plain text and html...
On September 5, 2013, The Guardian
the /New York Times
 /jointly
reported — based on documents provided by whistleblower Edward Snowden —
that the National Security Agency had compromised some of the encryption
that is most commonly used to secure internet transactions. The
encryption, or digital scrambling, that guards global commerce and
banking systems, protects sensitive data like trade secrets and medical
records, and automatically secures the emails, web searches, internet
chats and phone calls of Americans and others around the world.” One
2010 memo described that “for the past decade, NSA has led an
aggressive, multipronged effort to break widely used internet encryption
In support of the reporting, all three papers published redacted
portions of documents from the NSA along with its British counterpart,
GCHQ. Prior to publication of the story, the NSA vehemently argued that
any reporting of any kind on this program would jeopardize national
security by alerting terrorists to the fact that encryption products had
been successfully compromised. After the stories were published, U.S.
officials aggressively attacked
the newspapers for endangering national security and helping terrorists
with these revelations.
All three newspapers reporting this story rejected those arguments prior
to publication and decided to report the encryption-cracking successes.
Then-/NYT/ Executive Editor Jill Abramson described
the decision to publish as “not a particularly anguished one” in light
of the public interest in knowing about this program, and /ProPublica/
editors published a lengthy explanation
 along
with the story justifying their decision.
All three outlets, while reporting the anti-encryption efforts, redacted
portions of the documents they published or described. One redaction in
particular, found in the /NYT /documents
from the FY 2013 “black budget,” proved to be especially controversial
among tech and security experts, as they believed that the specific
identity of compromised encryption standards was being concealed by the
None of the documents in the Snowden archive identify all or even most
of the encryption standards that had been targeted, and there was a
concern that if an attempt were made to identify one or two of them, it
could mislead the public into believing that the others were safe. There
also seemed to be a concern among some editors that any attempt to
identify specific encryption standards would enable terrorists to know
which ones to avoid. One redaction in particular, from the /NYT/, was
designed to strike this balance and was the one that became most
The issue of this specific redaction was raised
 again
 by
security researchers last month
 in the wake of

a backdoor found on Juniper systems, followed by /The Intercept/’s
that the NSA and GCHQ had targeted Juniper. In light of that news, we
examined the documents referenced by those 2013 articles with particular
attention to that controversial redaction, and decided that it was
warranted to un-redact that passage. It reads as follows:
The reference to “the two leading encryption chips” provides some hints,
but no definitive proof, as to which ones were successfully targeted.
Matthew Green, a cryptography expert at Johns Hopkins, declined to
speculate on which companies this might reference. But he said that “the
damage has already been done. From what I’ve heard, many foreign
purchasers have already begun to look at all U.S.-manufactured
encryption technology with a much more skeptical eye as a result of what
the NSA has done. That’s too bad, because I suspect only a minority of
products have been compromised this way.”
NSA requested until 5 p.m. today to respond but then failed to do
so. (/Update/: The NSA subsequently emailed to say: “It would be
accurate to state that NSA declined to comment.”)

@_subject: [addenda] A Redaction Re-Visited: NSA Targeted ... 
For those too lazy to look it up here's some speculation from
Greenwald's IAMA October 31 2013.
Again, plain text and html:
While I do not know the name redacted in that report, the "VPN and Web
encryption devices" mentioned are most likely hardware SSL acceleration
appliances [1] , and due
to the sensitive nature of the backdoor being discussed, are probably in
chips fabricated by a US-based silicon designer using a US-located
silicon fabrication plant.
The reason for that is twofold; first, you don't want a foreign power
discovering your backdoor in a chip, and second, you don't want a
foreign power inserting their own backdoor.
The vendors [2]
list in Wikipedia lists the following vendors of SSL appliances:
  * Barracuda Networks
  * Array Networks
  * CAI Networks
  * Cavium Networks (fabless semiconductor designer)
  * Cisco Systems
  * Citrix Systems
  * Cotendo
  * Coyote point systems
  * Crescendo Networks
  * Exinda
  * F5 Networks
  * Foundry Networks
  * Forum Systems
  * Freescale Semiconductor (fabless and fab-owning)
  * Hifn
  * IBM (fab-owning)
  * Interface Masters Technologies
  * jetNEXUS
  * Juniper Networks
  * Nortel Networks
  * Radware
  * Riverbed Technology
  * Strangeloop Networks
  * Sun Microsystems
Of those, the two names that stand out most are IBM (which is no
stranger to crippling encryption upon the demands of the NSA, with
fabrication plants throughout the world and the United States, but which
isn't significantly given to florid chip descriptors) and Freescale
Semiconductors - it is itself a large semiconductor fabricator, focused
on semiconductor fabrication, with foundries in Chandler, AZ and Oak
Hill, TX.
One not mentioned in that list is Broadcom, a semiconductor manufacturer
that is /fabless/, that is - it doesn't own any fabrication capability,
itself. It does, however, design a very large percentage of
communications chips used in the industry. Not finding a Broadcom chip
somewhere in a device is notable.
The redacted space is roughly twelve all-caps letters or sixteen
mixed-case letters in that font. If we could have someone identify
exactly which font was used, then we could experiment with chip names
from SSL acceleration device manifests, in that font, and see which fit
into the redacted space, possibly with the manufacturer's name in front
of the chip - for example, the Freescale SAHARA
appears to fit nicely - and is touted as having configurable access
control to the random number generator and hashing functions on that
feature sheet linked - but is just one possibility. Another is the
PowerArchitecture™ from Mocana -formerly FreeScale
[4] .
If I were in the position to lead a project to reverse-engineer the
possible name of the chip, I would:
  * Find out what the top five top-selling SSL acceleration device
    manufacturers in the world are;
  * get a list of their best-selling products;
  * Get parts manifests for each of their popular products, possibly
    from an electronics tear down research organisation;
  * Locate and name the crypto accelerator chips;
  * Determine who designed and fabricated those chips.
  * Get the name of the font used in the report in the imgur link;
  * Compose the name of each of those chips in that font at that pitch;
  * Do a little comparing.
While that is /possible/, it is equally as likely that one variety or
species of chip is being named! i.e. /Intel Pentium chips/. There is
also no guarantee that the redacted text lists a florid,
marketing-friendly name, and may possibly be a code name internal to the
US intelligence community. These and other alternatives should not be

Not JUST FOIAs.
Fixing Pre-Publication Review: What Should Be Done?
By Steven Aftergood
Friday, January 15, 2016 at 9:15 AM
Jack Goldsmith and Oona Hathaway called attention in several recent
columns to the pre-publication review process (here, here, here, and
here) that many current and former national security officials and other
government employees must submit to before their work can be published.
The process, they argued, has become dysfunctional, overstepping
legitimate national security boundaries and infringing on freedom of
speech as well as the public’s right to know.
Their case is strong.
Among many pertinent examples, the experience of former Army Reserve
officer Anthony Shaffer is particularly instructive. After he wrote a
memoir of his Afghan war experience, Shaffer submitted his manuscript to
the Army for review, as required, and the approved text was printed. But
then the Defense Intelligence Agency intervened and objected that in its
estimation the cleared volume still contained classified information.
Publication was halted, and the Department of Defense was obliged to
purchase and pulp thousands of copies of the book, although numerous
publicity copies had already been released. A new version of the book
with the objectionable words and passages blacked out was finally
published for sale. (Shaffer presented his version of events in a First
Amendment lawsuit he brought in 2010, with very limited success.)
What makes the Shaffer case valuable in this context is that both the
pre- and post-publication review versions of his text entered public
circulation, permitting external scrutiny of the deletions required by
the official reviewers. In nearly every case, the redacted words and
passages seem to be devoid of national security sensitivity, as the Army
itself had originally concluded.
The most frequent redaction is the cover name that the author used while
serving in Afghanistan, “Christopher Stryker.” Also commonly deleted are
references to the National Security Agency, its headquarters location in
Fort Meade, Maryland, and the use of the term “SIGINT” (signals
intelligence). Somewhat more plausibly, the identity of the former CIA
chief of station in Kabul was replaced with a pseudonym. But rather less
plausibly, a passing mention of the name of character actor Ned Beatty
was deleted.
The point, in other words, is that there is an empirical foundation for
the belief that pre-publication review has gone off the rails. As it is
conducted today, the review process too often arbitrarily impedes the
freedom of many US government employees to participate in public discourse.

Just Security's editor:
This post is the latest installment of our “Monday Reflections” feature,
in which a different Just Security editor examines the big stories from
the previous week or looks ahead to key developments on the horizon.
The end of 2015 brought a flurry of announcements from tech companies,
including Facebook, Yahoo, and Microsoft, promising to notify their
users if the company believes that state-sponsored actors are targeting
the users’ accounts. These state-sponsored-attacker notifications share
features of other kinds of attributions. On the one hand, like the
Mandiant report and other reports by cybersecurity companies
highlighting state-sponsored cyberintrusions, private companies are
responsible for the attribution. On the other hand, like the limited
evidentiary disclosures made by the US government in attributing the
Sony Pictures hack to North Korea, the companies withhold the
evidentiary basis for the notifications in order to protect their
detection methods and avoid tipping off attackers.
The notifications contribute to evolving debates about the requisite
evidentiary basis for attribution of state-sponsored
cyberattacks—debates over types of evidence, amounts of evidence, and
levels of public disclosure that should be required for attribution in
different contexts. The notifications also show that while standards of
evidence for attribution are discussed in multilateral fora like the
United Nations, states are not the only parties whose practice matters.
Company Notifications
Google pioneered notifications to users about state-sponsored attacks in
2012. The company explained in a blog post at the time that in response
to “specific intelligence—either directly from users or from [its] own
monitoring efforts”—it would display a banner stating “Warning: We
believe state-sponsored attackers may be attempting to compromise your
account or computer.”
Facebook made a similar announcement in October 2015. In a blog post by
Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos, Facebook explained that it would
show users a warning if the company has “a strong suspicion that an
attack could be government-sponsored.” According to the New York Times,
in the wake of the Iranian nuclear deal and “[j]ust weeks into the new
[Facebook] alert system,” numerous State Department officials who work
on Iran and the Middle East received notifications that their accounts
had been targeted by a state-sponsored actor.
In mid-December, Twitter, which had not previously announced a policy on
state-sponsored attacks, notified some users that their accounts “may
have been targeted by state-sponsored actors,” who were “trying to
obtain information such as email addresses, IP addresses, and/or phone
numbers.” (A copy a notification sent to another user is available here.)
On December 21, Yahoo Chief Information Security Officer Bob Lord
announced that “Yahoo will now notify you if we strongly suspect that
your account may have been targeted by a state-sponsored actor.”
Microsoft followed suit on December 30, announcing in a blog post by
Corporate Vice President for Trustworthy Computing Scott Charney that
Microsoft “will now notify you if we believe your account has been
targeted or compromised by an individual or group working on behalf of a
nation state.”
According to the companies, they issue notifications for state-sponsored
attackers in particular because, as Facebook explains, “these types of
attacks tend to be more advanced and dangerous than others.” The
notifications are intended to prompt users to better secure their
account with the notifying company and other online accounts by, for
example, enabling two-step verification, changing passwords, and
monitoring for unusual activity.
Similarities to and Differences From Other Attributions to Nation-States
The state-sponsored-attacker notifications share similarities with prior
attributions by both the private sector and the US government. On the
one hand, the notifications (and the attributions supporting them) are
done by private companies, like the reports on state-sponsored
intrusions issued by cybersecurity companies like Mandiant and
Crowdstrike that I discussed in an earlier post.
On the other hand, unlike the extensive technical details that often
accompany such reports (see, for example, the Mandiant APT1 report), the
state-sponsored-attacker notifications do not come with evidence to back
up the attribution. Google’s post on the notifications explains: “You
might ask how we know this activity is state-sponsored. We can’t go into
the details without giving away information that would be helpful to
these bad actors, but our detailed analysis—as well as victim
reports—strongly suggest the involvement of states or groups that are
state-sponsored.” Facebook’s post similarly states, “To protect the
integrity of our methods and processes, we often won’t be able to
explain how we attribute certain attacks to suspected attackers.” The
invocation of secrecy to protect “methods and processes” echoes similar
statements made by the FBI in announcing the attribution of the Sony
Pictures hack to North Korea. The FBI press release explained that the
“need to protect sensitive sources and methods” prevented the Bureau
from sharing details of its evidence against North Korea. The FBI
provided a general description of the evidence supporting the
attribution, including, for example, “significant overlap between the
infrastructure used in this attack and other malicious cyber activity
the U.S. government has previously linked directly to North Korea.” But
the lack of detailed information triggered significant skepticism within
the security community, prompting FBI Director James Comey to release
additional information several weeks later.
Unlike the other types of attribution, the state-sponsored-attacker
notifications do not name the state involved. They simply inform a user
that some “state-sponsored actor” has targeted the user’s account. Of
course, upon receipt of a notification, some users may have a pretty
good idea which state is targeting them, and the pattern of accounts
targeted may reveal the state’s identity to the company or to the public
if/when the notifications become public. That may be what happened with
the Facebook notifications to State Department employees discussed
above. Still, the notifications’ failure to name the particular state
involved renders them somewhat less accusatory than attributions that

@_subject: Drivers Licenses? We Don' Need No Steekin' Licenses 
*The Decline of the Driver's License*
Julie Beck Jan 22, 2016, The Atlantic
Remember how, in /Clueless, /Alicia Silverstone’s character Cher fails
her driver’s test after nearly killing a biker and scraping her car
alongside several parked cars? And then how she asks, “Do you think I
should write them a note?” as she drives away? And then how, at the
climax of the movie, her friend Tai (Brittany Murphy) calls her “a
virgin who can’t drive ”
and it is just the harshest burn?
Well, that was a fictionalized version of the ‘90s, and this is now.
Things are different.
Young people are not getting driver’s licenses so much anymore. In fact,
no one is. According to a new study
by Michael Sivak and Brandon Schoettle at the University of Michigan
Transportation Research Institute, the percentage of people with a
driver’s license decreased between 2011 and 2014, across all age groups.
For people aged 16 to 44, that percentage has been decreasing steadily since 1983.
It’s especially pronounced for the teens—in 2014, just 24.5 percent of
16-year-olds had a license, a 47-percent decrease from 1983, when 46.2
percent did. And at the tail end of the teen years, 69 percent of
19-year-olds had licenses in 2014, compared to 87.3 percent in 1983, a
21-percent decrease.
Among young adults, the declines are smaller but still significant—16.4
percent fewer 20-to-24-year-olds had licenses in 2014 than in 1983, 11
percent fewer 25-to-29-year-olds, 10.3 percent fewer 30-to-34-year-olds,
and 7.4 percent fewer 35-to-39-year-olds. For people between 40 and 54,
the declines were small, less than 5 percent.
Above 55, the story’s a little different. Older adults were more likely
to have a driver’s license in 2014 than in 1983—in the case of those 70
and older, 43.6 percent more likely. But these age groups, too, saw a
modest decline from 2011 to 2014.
The researchers didn’t look into what the reasons for this decline might
be, but in an earlier study, they surveyed
adults ages 18 to 39 without driver’s licenses about why they don’t have
them. The top three reasons were: “too busy or not enough time to get a
driver’s license” (37 percent), “owning and maintaining a vehicle is too
expensive”(32 percent), and “able to get transportation from others” (31
Another reason that springs to mind is that more people are living in
cities and using public transportation. But in the survey, only 17
percent said their reason for not having a license was that they
preferred public transit.
In other studies, Sivak and Schoettle suggest that driving in general
may have already peaked in the United States. The total distance driven
per person in the U.S. was at its highest in 2004, and by 2013, it had
decreased by 9 percent. In part, this may be because people are
traveling less in general: Comparing 2004 to 2014, people spent less
time traveling to places to eat and drink, to buy goods and services, to
work, school, and to leisure activities. The ease of Amazon, the rise of
teleworking, and the endless entertainment provided by the Internet may
be leading people to stay home more, but it’s hard to say—there’s no
research available that explains these trends. A /New York Times article
from 2013 mentions unemployment as a reason for young people buying
fewer cars, but as Jordan Weissman noted in /The Atlantic/
that same year, downward trends in driving started before the recession.
Maybe it’s just that people today have more things they’d rather do than
practice parallel parking between traffic cones. Or maybe it’s because
the photos on those plastic cards are almost never flattering. Sivak and
Schoettle are hoping to soon study possible reasons for the drop in
driver’s licenses. But regardless of the cause, it seems that if you
want to insult a teen today, shaming them for not being able to operate
a motor vehicle might not be the way to go.

Every society is a collective. Fascist societies maintain their
collective structure by emotional, psychological, and physically
destructive methods. In any legitimate anarchist collective society if
you don't fit somewhere, that's ok... You don't have to.

Situationists and other anarchist cells for example:
You don't hear this sort of thing from intrinsically Fascist formations

America never had a revolution. Revolutions are based on ideology. Greed
is NOT an ideology.
Ben Franklin on the roots of that Greed:
"Sir, there are two passions which have a powerful influence on the
affairs of men. These are ambition and avarice; the love of power, and
the love of money. Separately each of these has great force in prompting
men to action; but when united in view of the same object, they have in
many minds the most violent effects.
Place before the eyes of such men, a post of honor that shall be at the
same time a place of profit, and they will move heaven and earth to
obtain it. The vast number of such places it is that renders the British
Government so tempestuous. The struggles for them are the true sources
of all these factions which are perpetually dividing the Nation,
distracting its Councils, hurrying sometimes into fruitless and
mischievous wars, and often compelling a submission to dishonorable
terms of peace.
And of what kind are the men that will strive for this profitable
pre-eminence, through all the bustle of cabal, the heat of contention,
the infinite mutual abuse of parties, tearing to pieces the best of
characters? It will not be the wise and moderate; the Iovers of peace
and good order, the men fittest for the trust. It will be the bold and
the violent, the men of strong passions and indefatigable activity in
their selfish pursuits.
These will thrust themselves into your Government and be your rulers.
And these too will be mistaken in the expected happiness of their
situation: For their vanquished competitors of the same spirit, and from
the aame motives will perpetually be endeavoring to distress their
administration, thwart their measures, and render them odious to the
people." ~Benjamin Franklin, Opposition to Executive Salaries,

I figure with Donald Trump, having pretty much destroyed the

siphoning off 3rd party support, Hillary will be the first president in
decades to have a REAL mandate instead of the bogus ones, like Reagan

as wild in the street. Wheelmen for professional bank/jewelery store
robbery teams tend to be pretty good drivers too.
Obsessive avoidance does not take you out of the game. It actually make

It was an ArpaNet machine a mid-size mainframe in an air conditioned
room. Telnet and all the Unix comm stuff had already been developed but
only a few mil companies had access to .com addresses in the early 70s
to use it. They didn't toy with the machine (just toyed with the idea of
taking an ax to it) but that's about the same time period I first heard
about telnet, ftp, irc.
Ps. Ended up pissing on it and destroying the air conditioning's access
to the room (blocked vents). Prolly caused a zillion dollars in damage.
The perps escaped into the crowd in the building as the police entered
to clear it and were never caught.

Local PD used one to kill a guy who was already dead about 8/9 years ago.
A cop saw a wanted fleeing felon in a van in a parking lot, approached
the door, gunfire exchanged and he retreated. An hour or two later in
the 'standoff' they sent out a robot to place a concussion grenade under
the van and detonated it. They found out the perp had been mortally
wounded in the initial exchange of gunfire and was dead when they blew
him up.
They've also used the robot to blow up a couple of Geotag gamer caches

guilty only if he not only violated the victim’s Fourth Amendment right
to be free from excessive force, ***but the officer also “willfully”
violated that right***".

    They know who the car belongs to. He has coffee here every day. He's
    an amputee who gets meds. They think he's a drug dealer because he's
    kind to the homeless and outcasts andbuys them coffee, gives them
    spare change... and the missing plate gave the police, the
    semi-deputized 'rangers' (muni codes only) and a private patrol

My dad, A WWII army Colonel, later coordinator for tech writers
(InfoSec) at NASA Huntsville, military NASA...  Later a regional
coordinator for the ADL in the Southeast US until his passing in the
2007 (He stalked the KKK with a bodyguard taking pics of the 'unhoooded'
and passed other racist org intel along), in other words, 'a company
man'  told me a couple of years before he died, with some surprise in
his voice:
    "You know? You kids stopped that war!"
Yes... Yes we did. But NOT before we "Brought the war home", and it
wasn't JUST kids. BTW, he was alive for the invasion of Iraq and DID NOT
LIKE what he was seeing. SOMETHING changed about US Foreign policy in a
way he had not expected and he was looking at Pentagon 'Generals" on TV
wondering if they even knew what they were talking about.
My dad also had his security clearance threatened because of my teen
antiwar activism. THE NYPD's "Red Squad" Capt. Finnegan, the 'silver
fox', and his thugs, got my name after a guerrilla theater action and
bust at NYU's Queens campus and passed it on to the feds who weren't
aware I hadn't seen him for ten years and he had no say over me legally
or otherwise. Now they'd know. And I didn't need Ed Snowden to inform me
the US government spies on, and is scared of, it's own citizens.
Not so sure about Vietnam, an extractive resource war (Tungsten, tin,
rubber, much more incl oil in the Spratlys, S China Sea, that
Halliburton was test drilling for under mercenary and special forces
protection) but later, and now, ABSOFUCKINGLUTELY. The only thing of
value the US produces anymore is weapons systems, and it's hard to sell
them unless they've been field tested.
See this musical informative vid (sorry FB only...Youtube DMCA pulled

as with 'Psychological Kevlar' pre-treating for PTSD and a bunch of
other stuff, they use soldiers as guinea pigs. It's IN THE CONTRACT.

I remember seeing pics of special forces guys shoveling Agent Orange
into the hoppers of Bird Dog Cessnas in Vietnam's jungles bare-chested,
without so much as a dust mask. I know a guy who has lung disease... He
was in the Navy. His job was cleaning up ship hulls for repainting. They
gave him basic dust masks but NEVER checked to make sure he was using
it.. Not that the masks would have been effective but.

Occupy Wall Steeet wasn't a focused protest it was a general
insurrection and it was fun but insurrections either disintegrate or
they are crushed. I'm talking about coordinated action on a single focus
with tens of thousands of people in the streets all across the US and
all sorts of side shows like continual sabotage of the system.... The
"Dave Graebers" and other 'vanguard' types were there to fuck everything
up too, but for the most part they has so little control over
organizations that what happened on the street was not what they
intended, but EVERYONE was FOCUSED ON THE WAR.
EVERYONE knew someone killed or maimed in Vietnam, or their GF's brother
was killed there. The US government was turning college students into
cannon fodder with the draft and if your grades didn't keep up with the
continually changing requirements of the selective service... changed to
suit their manpower needs, off you went and your organized religion
wasn't gonna help you either. They'd be glad to pray over your coffin
and call you a hero though.
This is why AUTOMATED WARFARE. It IS most likely the PRIMARY REASON for it
Americans don't like to see the remains of their loved ones come home in
a sack on a C-5a Globemaster and it undermines the Pentagon's ability to
make war.
Want to change things? Anything. It take two traits utterly lacking in
American society at the moment.

do you really think Applebaum is of the same level of importance to the things you mention -
    privacy / human rights / surveillance state, etc, as Julian Assange or Ed Snowden?
It's just teh "MAN'S" way of saying "hi... We're gonna fuck over all

Remember what Chris Dorner did to the LAPD that scared the living shit
out of them? He went after the cops' family and friends. It's classic
counterinsurgency tactic he learned from the kind of people who want to
kill Snowden and Assange.
It's NOT limited to high profile people either. I knew a woman a junkie

    Erdogan will not forgive the Obama administration for leading him up the

    Erdogan's hand is ISIS, and they're already all over Europe thanks to

and they HAVE terrorized those refugees to not talk, and IF Erdogan

Un-dated discussion paper from "MIND  Internet and Security":
Power in the Age of the Feudal Internet
Discussion Papers > Internet and Security > Proposition
Bruce Schneier, Cryptographer and Computer Security Specialist and
Author of Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust Society Needs to Thrive
We’re in the middle of an epic battle for power in cyberspace. On one
side are the nimble, unorganized, distributed powers such as dissident
groups, criminals, and hackers. On the other side are the traditional,
organized, institutional powers such as governments and large
multinational corporations. During its early days, the Internet gave
coordination and efficiency to the powerless. It made them powerful, and
seem unbeatable. But now the more traditional institutional powers are
winning, and winning big. How these two fare long-term, and the fate of
the majority of us that don’t fall into either group, is an open
question – and one vitally important to the future of the Internet.
In its early days, there was a lot of talk about the “natural laws of
the Internet” and how it would empower the masses, upend traditional
power blocks, and spread freedom throughout the world. The international
nature of the Internet made a mockery of national laws. Anonymity was
easy. Censorship was impossible. Police were clueless about cybercrime.
And bigger changes were inevitable. Digital cash would undermine
national sovereignty. Citizen journalism would undermine the media,
corporate PR, and political parties. Easy copying would destroy the
traditional movie and music industries. Web marketing would allow even
the smallest companies to compete against corporate giants. It really
would be a new world order.
Some of this did come to pass. The entertainment industries have been
transformed and are now more open to outsiders. Broadcast media has
changed, and some of the most influential people in the media have come
from the blogging world. There are new ways to run elections and
organize politically. Facebook and Twitter really did help topple
governments. But that was just one side of the Internet’s disruptive
character. Today, the traditional corporate and government power is
ascendant, and more powerful than ever.
On the corporate side, power is consolidating around both vendor-managed
user devices and large personal-data aggregators. It’s a result of two
current trends in computing. First, the rise of cloud computing means
that we no longer have control of our data. Our e-mail, photos,
calendar, address book, messages, and documents are on servers belonging
to Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and so on. And second, the rise
of vendor-managed platforms means that we no longer have control of our
computing devices. We’re increasingly accessing our data using iPhones,
iPads, Android phones, Kindles, ChromeBooks, and so on. Even Windows 8
and Apple’s Mountain Lion are heading in the direction of less user control.
I have previously called this model of computing feudal. Users pledge
allegiance to more powerful companies who, in turn, promise to protect
them from both sysadmin duties and security threats. It’s a metaphor
that’s rich in history and in fiction, and a model that’s increasingly
permeating computing today.
Feudal security consolidates power in the hands of the few. These
companies act in their own self-interest. They use their relationship
with us to increase their profits, sometimes at our expense. They act
arbitrarily. They make mistakes. They’re deliberately changing social
norms. Medieval feudalism gave the lords vast powers over the landless
peasants; we’re seeing the same thing on the Internet.
It’s not all bad, of course. Medieval feudalism was a response to a
dangerous world, and depended on hierarchical relationships with
obligations in both directions. We – especially those of us who are not
technical – like the convenience, redundancy, portability, automation,
and shareability of vendor-managed devices. We like cloud backup. We
like automatic updates. We like it that Facebook just works – from any
device, anywhere.
Government power is also increasing on the Internet. Long gone are the
days of an Internet without borders, and governments are better able to
use the four technologies of social control: surveillance, censorship,
propaganda, and use control. There’s a growing “cyber sovereignty”
movement that totalitarian governments are embracing to give them more
control – a change the US opposes, because it has substantial control
under the current system. And the cyberwar arms race is in full swing,
further consolidating government power.
In many cases, the interests of corporate and government power are
aligning. Both corporations and governments want ubiquitous
surveillance, and the NSA is using Google, Facebook, Verizon, and others
to get access to data it couldn’t otherwise. The entertainment industry
is looking to governments to enforce their antiquated business models.
Commercial security equipment from companies like BlueCoat and Sophos is
being used by oppressive governments to surveil and censor their
citizens. The same facial recognition technology that Disney uses in its
theme parks also identifies protesters in China and Occupy Wall Street
activists in New York.
What happened? How, in those early Internet years, did we get the future
so wrong?
The truth is that technology magnifies power in general, but the rates
of adoption are different. The unorganized, the distributed, the
marginal, the dissidents, the powerless, the criminal: they can make use
of new technologies faster. And when those groups discovered the
Internet, suddenly they had power. But when the already powerful big
institutions finally figured out how to harness the Internet for their
needs, they had more power to magnify. That’s the difference: the
distributed were more nimble and were quicker to make use of their new
power, while the institutional were slower but were able to use their
power more effectively. So while the Syrian dissidents used Facebook to
organize, the Syrian government used Facebook to identify dissidents.
All isn’t lost for distributed power, though. For institutional power
the Internet is a change in degree, but for distributed power it’s a
change of kind. The Internet gives decentralized groups – for the first
time – access to coordination. This can be incredibly empowering, as we
saw in the SOPA/PIPA debate, Gezi, and Brazil. It can invert power
dynamics, even in the presence of surveillance censorship and use control.
There’s another more subtle trend, one I discuss in my book Liars and
Outliers. If you think of security as an arms race between attackers and
defenders, technological advances – firearms, fingerprint
identification, lockpicks, the radio – give one side or the other a
temporary advantage. But most of the time, a new technology benefits the
attackers first.
We saw this in the early days of the Internet. As soon as the Internet
started being used for commerce, a new breed of cybercriminal emerged,
immediately able to take advantage of the new technology. It took police
a decade to catch up. And we saw it on social media, as political
dissidents made quicker use of its organizational powers before
totalitarian regimes were able to use it effectively as a surveillance
and propaganda tool. The distributed are not hindered by bureaucracy,
and sometimes not by laws or ethics. They can evolve faster.
This delay is what I call a “security gap”. It’s greater when there’s
more technology, and in times of rapid technological change. And since
our world is one in which there’s more technology than ever before, and
a greater rate of technological change than ever before, we should
expect to see a greater security gap than ever before. In other words,
there will be an increasing time period where the nimble distributed
power can make use of new technologies before the slow institutional
power can make better use of those technologies.
It’s quick vs. strong. To return to medieval metaphors, you can think of
a nimble distributed power – whether marginal, dissident, or criminal –
as Robin Hood. And you can think of ponderous institutional power – both
government and corporate – as the Sheriff of Nottingham.
So who wins? Which type of power dominates in the coming decades?
Right now, it looks like institutional power. Ubiquitous surveillance
means that it’s easier for the government to round up dissidents than it
is for the dissidents to anonymously organize. Data monitoring means it
is easier for the Great Firewall of China to block data than it is to
circumvent it. And as easy as it is to circumvent copy protection
schemes, most users can’t do it.
This is largely because leveraging power on the Internet requires
technical expertise, and most distributed power groups don’t have that
expertise. Those with sufficient technical ability will be able to stay
ahead of institutional power. Whether it’s setting up your own e-mail
server, effectively using encryption and anonymity tools, or breaking
copy protection, there will always be technologies that are one step
ahead of institutional power. This is why cybercrime is still pervasive,
even as institutional power increases, and why organizations like
Anonymous are still a social and political force. If technology
continues to advance – and there’s no reason to believe it won’t – there
will always be a security gap in which technically savvy Robin Hoods can
My main concern is for the rest of us: everyone in the middle. These are
people who don’t have the technical ability to evade either the large
governments and corporations that are controlling our Internet use, or
the criminal and hacker groups who prey on us. These are the people who
accept the default configuration options, arbitrary terms of service,
NSA-installed back doors, and the occasional complete loss of their
data. In the feudal world, these are the hapless peasants. And it’s even
worse when the feudal lords – or any powers – fight each other.
As anyone watching Game of Thrones knows, peasants get trampled when
powers fight: when Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon fight it out in
the market; when the US, EU, China, and Russia fight it out in
geopolitics; or when it’s the US vs. the terrorists or China vs. its
dissidents. The abuse will only get worse as technology continues to
advance. In the battle between institutional power and distributed
power, more technology means more damage. Cybercriminals can rob more
people more quickly than criminals who have to physically visit everyone
they rob. Digital pirates can make more copies of more things much more
quickly than their analog forebears. And 3D printers mean that the data
use restriction debate now involves guns, not movies. It’s the same
problem as the “weapons of mass destruction” fear: terrorists with
nuclear or biological weapons can do a lot more damage than terrorists
with conventional explosives.
It’s a numbers game. Very broadly, assume there’s a particular crime
rate society is willing to tolerate. With historically inefficient
criminals, we were willing to live with some percentage of criminals in
our society. As technology makes each individual criminal more powerful,
the percentage we can tolerate decreases. This is essentially the
“weapons of mass destruction” debate: as the amount of damage each
individual terrorist can do increases, we need to do increasingly more
to prevent even a single terrorist success.
The more destabilizing the technologies, the greater the rhetoric of
fear, and the stronger institutional power will get. This means even
more repressive security measures, even if the security gap means that
such measures are increasingly ineffective. And it will squeeze the
peasants in the middle even more.
Without the protection of feudal lords, we’re subject to abuse by
criminals and other feudal lords. Also, there are often no other options
but to align with someone. But both these corporations and the
government – and sometimes the two in cahoots – are using their power to
their own advantage, trampling on our rights in the process. And without
the technical savvy to become Robin Hoods ourselves, we have no recourse
but to submit to whatever institutional power wants.
So what happens as technology increases? Is a police state the only
effective way to control distributed power and keep our society safe? Or
do the fringe elements inevitably destroy society as technology
increases their power? Probably neither doomsday scenario will come to
pass, but figuring out a stable middle ground is hard. These questions
are complicated, and dependent on future technological advances that we
cannot predict. But they are primarily political questions, and any
solutions will be political.
In the short term, we need more transparency and oversight. The more we
know of what institutional powers are doing, the more we can trust that
they are not abusing their authority. We have long known this to be true
in government, but we have increasingly ignored it in our fear of
terrorism and other modern threats. This is also true for corporate
power. Unfortunately, market dynamics will not necessarily force
corporations to be transparent; we need laws to do that. The same is
true for decentralized power; transparency is how we will differentiate
political dissidents from criminal organizations.
Oversight is also critically important, and is another long-understood
mechanism for checking power. This can be a combination of things:
courts that act as third-party advocates for the rule of law rather than
rubber-stamp organizations, legislatures that understand the
technologies and how they affect power balances, and vibrant
public-sector press and watchdog groups that analyze and debate the
actions of those wielding power.
Transparency and oversight give us the confidence to trust institutional
powers to fight the bad side of distributed power, while still allowing
the good side to flourish. For if we are going to entrust our security
to institutional powers, we need to know they will act in our interests
and not abuse that power. Otherwise, democracy fails.
In the longer term, we need to work to reduce power differences. The key
to all of this is access to data. On the Internet, data is power. To the
extent the powerless have access to it, they gain in power. To the
extent that the already powerful have access to it, they further
consolidate their power. As we look to reducing power imbalances, we
have to look at data: data privacy for individuals, mandatory disclosure
laws for corporations, and open government laws.
Medieval feudalism evolved into a more balanced relationship in which
lords had responsibilities as well as rights. Today’s Internet feudalism
is both ad-hoc and one-sided. Those in power have a lot of rights, but
increasingly few responsibilities or limits. We need to rebalance this
relationship. In medieval Europe, the rise of the centralized state and
the rule of law provided the stability that feudalism lacked. The Magna
Carta first forced responsibilities on governments and put humans on the
long road toward government by the people and for the people. In
addition to re-reigning in government power, we need similar
restrictions on corporate power: a new Magna Carta focused on the
institutions that abuse power in the 21st century.
Today’s Internet is a fortuitous accident: a combination of an initial
lack of commercial interests, government benign neglect, military
requirements for survivability and resilience, and computer engineers
building open systems that worked simply and easily. Corporations have
turned the Internet into an enormous revenue generator, and they’re not
going to back down easily. Neither will governments, which have
harnessed the Internet for political control.
We’re at the beginning of some critical debates about the future of the
Internet: the proper role of law enforcement, the character of
ubiquitous surveillance, the collection and retention of our entire
life’s history, how automatic algorithms should judge us, government
control over the Internet, cyberwar rules of engagement, national
sovereignty on the Internet, limitations on the power of corporations
over our data, the ramifications of information consumerism, and so on.
This won’t be an easy period for us as we try to work these issues out.
Historically, no shift in power has ever been easy. Corporations have
turned our personal data into an enormous revenue generator, and they’re
not going to back down. Neither will governments, who have harnessed
that same data for their own purposes. But we have a duty to tackle this
Data is the pollution problem of the information age. All computer
processes produce it. It stays around. How we deal with it -- how we
reuse and recycle it, who has access to it, how we dispose of it, and
what laws regulate it -- is central to how the information age
functions. And I believe that just as we look back at the early decades
of the industrial age and wonder how society could ignore pollution in
their rush to build an industrial world, our grandchildren will look
back at us during these early decades of the information age and judge
us on how we dealt with the rebalancing of power resulting from all this
new data.
I can’t tell you what the result will be. These are all complicated
issues, and require meaningful debate, international cooperation, and
innovative solutions. We need to decide on the proper balance between
institutional and decentralized power, and how to build tools that
amplify what is good in each while suppressing the bad.

Hi Zeenan...
You never DID get back to me about where you got that perverse
interpolation of some salafist screed about the rules of Goat-Fucking,
Here are some references.
The basic tenets of the religion of hate analyzed...
Also see: Open Letter to al-Bagdadi and ISIS by Muslim scholars from
around the world.
1. It is forbidden in Islam to issue fatwas without all the necessary
learning requirements. Even then fatwas must follow Islamic legal theory
as defined in the Classical texts. It is also forbidden to cite a
portion of a verse from the Qur’an—or part of a verse—to derive a ruling
without looking at everything that the Qur’an and Hadith teach related
to that matter.
In other words, there are strict subjective and objective prerequisites
for fatwas , and one cannot ‘cherry-pick’ Qur’anic verses for legal
arguments without considering the entire Qur’an and Hadith .
2. It is forbidden in Islam to issue legal rulings about anything
without mastery of the Arabic language.
3. It is forbidden in Islam to oversimplify Shari’ah matters and ignore
established Islamic sciences.
4. It is permissible in Islam [for scholars] to differ on any matter,
except those fundamentals of religion that all Muslims must know.
5. It is forbidden in Islam to ignore the reality of contemporary times
when deriving legal rulings.
6. It is forbidden in Islam to kill the innocent.
7. It is forbidden in Islam to kill emissaries, ambassadors, and
diplomats; hence it is forbidden to kill journalists and aid workers.
8. Jihad in Islam is defensive war. It is not permissible without the
right cause, the right purpose and without the right rules of conduct.
9. It is forbidden in Islam to declare people non-Muslim unless he (or
she) openly declares disbelief.
10. It is forbidden in Islam to harm or mistreat—in any way—Christians
or any ‘People of the Scripture’.
11. It is obligatory to consider Yazidis as People of the Scripture.
12. The re-introduction of slavery is forbidden in Islam. It was
abolished by universal consensus.
13. It is forbidden in Islam to force people to convert.
14. It is forbidden in Islam to deny women their rights.
15. It is forbidden in Islam to deny children their rights.
16. It is forbidden in Islam to enact legal punishments (hudud ) without
following the correct procedures that ensure justice and mercy.
17. It is forbidden in Islam to torture people.
18 It is forbidden in Islam to disfigure the dead.
19. It is forbidden in Islam to attribute evil acts to God.
20. It is forbidden in Islam to destroy the graves and shrines of
Prophets and Companions.
21.Armed insurrection is forbidden in Islam for any reason other than
clear disbelief by the ruler and not allowing people to pray.
22. It is forbidden in Islam to declare a caliphate without consensus
from all Muslims.
23. Loyalty to one’s nation is permissible in Islam.
24. After the death of the Prophet, Islam does not require anyone to
emigrate anywhere.

My understanding is the Islamic banks have a 'workaround'. Instead of
charging interest you simply owe the loan amount plus whatever the
interest is. If you borrow $100 and the interest is 5% you've borrowed
$105 dollars. Except for the more extreme fundamentalists, it's been
accepted that way for a long time.
No one said "point 5" was gonna be easy...

The Persian civilization spawned three major religions:

I really really wanted an Altair when I saw it in a boys life magazine
circa 1967-8 but my parents were NEVER going to shell out that kind of
money so I missed the early days of personal computing.
I started with Basic V1.1 on an Epson HX-20 CP/M laptop in the mid-late 80s.
Wrote a terminal/logging program which I used on BBSs and Packet Radio
that ran  baud that would also spit out a printed log of the radio
contact. I wrote it myself from examples provided in the Epson manual
that was full of mistakes I had to debug and correct.
I went to a Tandy ColorComputer and Basic09, then OS9 L1 and L2
(microware for 68XXX chips)
Then I learned a little C, but before I could dig in there was C+ and
C++ and then...
...and then I figured out unless I was getting paid  for writing code so
I could write them off I simply couldn't afford the INCREDIBLY PRICED
books on the subject... A subject that was changing at lightspeed...
before WWW tutorials etc.
I did pick up enough Jscript to get me in trouble though.
I apologize to NO ONE for not posting directly code-related items. That
IS NOT the purpose of this list according to EVERYTHING I've managed to
find about it historically and suspect it just more feudal bullshit from
people who 'came lately' to the coding world, and as I claimed before,
came for the money.
By the time I figured out there was money to be made. I could already
see, considering I lived in the heart of it, all the psychopaths
flocking to 'the next big thing' and decided I would NEVER EVER EVER do
code work for a living (at least in the US). I was looking at Cisco
books laying around at the Gym when CIsco started up and saw that I had
learned 99% of it playing with packet radio, iNos jNos and TPK.
Fuck 'em. Fuck their money. You can train a CHILD or that guy sitting on
the ground downtown panhandling to do coding. It's NOT brain surgery.

The Weaponising Of Social Part 1: The Crucifixion of IOError
by The Indicter
Thanks to a small group of supposed anonymity-protecting privacy
activists thousands of people now know the name of Jacob Appelbaum’s
fiancée`. Even those that didn’t want to.
We found it out by reading an extremely controversial website launched a
week ago, that had a few sparse accounts of some nasty sounding
happenings allegedly involving Jacob, with promises of more to come.
No one truly concerned with privacy issues should care if Jacob has a
fiancée let alone who she is, out of respect for his right to a private
life and because it is patently obvious that attacks on him shouldn’t
extend to her.
Her name was later removed after the bulk of the damage had been done,
without any editorial admission that it had ever been there in the first
Unfortunately, that simple yet far-reaching invasion of privacy, is only
the tip of the iceberg.
[Update 12/06/16: Detractors are claiming the above is factually
incorrect as they say Appelbaum is no longer engaged. The source was the
smear website itself, which named Appelbaum’s ‘partner’, then removed
her name and called her his ‘fiancée’, and now implies past tense. IMO,
who he is or isn’t engaged to is frankly his own business. The point
In a strange paradox, Jacob Appelbaum’s accusers both want to deny any
relevance between their accusations and him being a known target of the
US government as a result of the nature of his work, while having the
clearly stated aim of wanting to prevent him from being able to continue it.
Even as they are being dwarfed, swept aside and forgotten in the
controversy, the topics on which Jacob Appelbaum and WikiLeaks work are
much larger and more important than any individual.  Those who
concertedly dedicate themselves to such causes are unjustly forced to
quite literally risk our safety, our families, our livelihoods, our
citizenships, our liberty and everything we own, in our fight to
preserve our ideals and our planet.
The high stakes in a situation like this demand more than knee-jerk
reactions, hearsay, and because-all-my-friends-say, when one of us is
attacked or discredited. They deserve the investment of time; of
serious, weighty yet measured consideration; analysis; and
investigation. All of the elements that should be prerequisite to
forming any intellectual opinon, let alone one where reputations and
potentially lives are at stake.
But we are yet to see any of that, at least anything more in-depth than
a series of personal statements via “Twitlonger”. Just a whole lot of
uproar; a whole lot more silence; and a bunch of axe-grinding. With very
little actual analysis, because the topic of rape is so taboo that most
people are shit scared of approaching it objectively.
As such, this post should be subtitled “We Owe IO More Than 600 Words”.
Because we do. We owe him much, much more than that.
We owe it to him and to our causes, to find out the truth.
Preamble dispensed with, I’m going to give some historical context to
what made me write this article and analyse the claims made on and by
the anti-IO website. In Part 2 of this article, we will look into the
main personalities that appear to be driving this, discuss some of the
environmental factors affecting the response and get into the wider
context, which is all but being ignored
Lessons Long-Since Learned
The website now being widely sourced as justification for dismantling
Appelbaum’s career and reputation does as much to discredit itself as it
does to discredit Jacob.
That the name of the female closest to him was disclosed in a forum that
claims to exist to protect women was not the first red flag.
Several years ago, a situation unfolded where a prominent activist
(Activist A)  was privately accused of rape by another activist
(Activist B). This was then broadcast far and wide through the creation
of a Twitter account that purported to be Activist B talking directly
and openly about her first hand experience of being raped by Activist A.
Many fell for it, and instantaneously an online frenzy was being whisked
up against Activist A. For all the same – on the surface – seemingly
valid reasons that we see people turning on Jacob Appelbaum for now.
However, when I read the tweets of the account calling for the
persecution of Activist A, I innately knew that what I was reading was
not the words of a rape survivor. It came across to me as someone trying
to posture themselves as one, out of empathy and/or indignation, rather
than legitimately recounting an actual firsthand memory of a personal
So I did the socially unacceptable but morally right thing and spoke
out. While people were aghast that I dared to question a “victim” – the
facade soon crumbled and it turned out that my instincts were absolutely
The account claiming to be a rape victim was not Activist B at all. It
was Activist C, her boyfriend, who had (according to Activist B, without
her knowledge) taken it upon himself to impersonate her and attack
Activist A in public after she had raised issues in confidence. There
had been some question of infidelity, she had privately claimed lack of
consent, Activist C had decided that Activist A’s life should be ruined
as a result, and gone public.
Whether or not Activist A ever did in fact rape Activist B got lost in
the controversy of Activist C’s foolish meddling in the entire
situation. Activist A claimed no. Activist B claimed yes. Activist C
permanently obscured the situation by his actions.
So how was I able to immediately identify, on gut feeling, that this
anonymous account claiming to be a rape victim was not a rape victim?
And why did I risk my “social capital” to speak out on such a highly
contentious topic?
Because people who are not survivors of rape cannot competently
impersonate survivors of rape. They think the act itself is the whole
story but it is just a tiny fraction of it. So when they attempt to
concoct the scenario, they always limit it to the specific event rather
than the holistic experience, the emotional journey.
Rape Testimony
Real rape testimony is 20% what physically happened and 80% how it
affected us. It is visceral. It is memories and shapes and impressions
and images. It is sights and smells and feelings, a twisted nostalgia we
would desperately like to free ourselves from but cannot ever. It is
asymmetrical and it evolves. It unfolds. The expression of it is a
cathartic, painful release but a necessary step in the healing.
It is not a telegram. It is not a thematical construct with set form or
submission rules.
They are not a fixed length. Nor fixed sentence structures. They do not
have a statistical linguistic pattern. They are not uniform. They ebb
and flow in proportion to the victim’s telling. They sway and move,
mobile in the outpouring of emotion, of grief.
When multiple examples of rape testimonies are compared side by side,
they don’t conform in any way save in their effective translation of
trauma, of a raw and primal pain.
So when I realised the extent to which the accounts on the anti-Jacob
website do conform and began to note other anomalies, huge alarm bells
started ringing.
Speaking From Experience
As someone intimately acquainted with the plight of survivors, you can
feel inside you when something is just not right with a situation like
this. As a survivor, my personal obligation to other victims and to the
truth has led me to speak up several times in the past – even when it is
utterly humiliating, damaging to my reputation or even outright
dangerous to do so. This is not an expectation I have of others – I have
the benefit of the passage of time, maturity, experience and healing –
water under the bridge – that many others don’t. Thus I spoke out in an
article addressing statements made by the Minister of Police and the
grotesquely poor conduct of NZ cops in handling sexual assault including
my own historical abduction and gang rape. I likewise spoke the
difficult and humiliating truth against the notorious ‘FBI’ snitch Sabu
when he assumed the identity of one of my friends in order to target me
sexually, in an attempt to entrap me. I spoke out about my favourite
publication in the world when a new staffer there published a ridiculous
pile of rape apologist bullshit. I spoke out against the self-admitted
serial pack rapists known as The RoastBusters who weren’t even so much
as arrested after bragging about stupefying and pack-raping dozens of
13-16 year old girls. Then I spoke out against media’s irresponsible
reporting on the issue. And again, when the Minister of Justice used the
plight of the many Roastbusters victims who had received no justice
whatsoever, in order to falsely justify the passage of anti-trolling
Even though it triggered the hell out of me to do so, I attended protest
events, supported movements, and covered live actions in support of
survivors, and in defiance of the repressive tactics wielded by New
Zealand’s blatantly corrupt and incompetent police forces, who so
profoundly fail survivors, and the public.
As faithfully as I spoke out in all those cases, so must I speak out too
when I believe that rape testimony may be being falsely manufactured, or
manipulated, or misrepresented, or used to serve the ulterior motives
and agenda of someone(s) who may not be rape survivors at all.
“Believe victims“, some people say. The key word is not believe. The key
word is victims. Not “believe any two-bit twat(s) who impersonate
survivors and/or edit rape testimony because they have something to gain
by smearing someone all over the net, in the name of other victims.”
Especially when in doing so, knowingly or not, those someone(s) are also
serving the interests of The Empire and damaging movements that people
pay dearly to create, build and sustain. (If you are in any doubt about
this take note that among the first people gloating about Jacob
Appelbaum’s perceived downfall was in fact, Sabu.)
For The Empire, I can assure you, does not give the slightest flying
shit about rape victims, unless they can be used to its advantage. On a
daily basis, it perpetuates and facilitates mass rape all over the
world, while expending tax dollars to cement and maintain all of the
societal and environmental conditions that create rape culture.
The double-edged sword of the taboo of rape was constantly wielded
against Julian Assange and his supporters over the last five years,
albeit with ever-dwindling effectiveness. Allegations of rape against
information activists are a lose-lose situation for us but a ‘win’ for
our enemies, and that is again apparent in Appelbaum’s case. The end
result is a real-life example of why these types of accusations are such
an efficient tool for those wishing to utterly devastate and
incapacitate a perceived rival. It emboldens the targets enemies and
silences their friends. It isolates them and eclipses all their prior
For all these reasons I cannot merely sit silent, or put out an
ambiguous 600-word opinion piece sitting on a fence.
Instead I did what I do best. I read, read, read, read and read more.
Dug, investigated and analysed.
The following, is my findings.

WhatsApp Forensic Artifacts: Chats Aren’t Being Deleted
Posted on July 28, 2016
Sorry, folks, while experts are saying the encryption checks out in
WhatsApp, it looks like the latest version of the app tested leaves
forensic trace of all of your chats, even after you’ve deleted, cleared,
or archived them… even if you “Clear All Chats”. In fact, the only way
to get rid of them appears to be to delete the app entirely.
To test, I installed the app and started a few different threads. I then
archived some, cleared, some, and deleted some threads. I made a second
backup after running the “Clear All Chats” function in WhatsApp. None of
these deletion or archival options made any difference in how deleted
records were preserved. In all cases, the deleted SQLite records
remained intact in the database.

"cypherpunks Personally I think having to expose the phone number of a smartphone to
another user to establish a chat is an incredible security risk in the
short and long run and leads to all sorts of metadata harvesting of your
unencrypted info. It appears one should keep a low-budget smartphone for
that use instead of their main number for better persec. I questioned Morgan Mayhem (Intercept's sysadmin/cybersec guy) about
that when he broached how secure signal is (he's one of the developers)
on his twitter feed. Never got a reply.
Telegram allows the use of an  instead of exposing your number if
you set up an account but I'm unsure what happens when a connection is
established and the contact is added to you contact list

I agree. They're like flash drives. RF inert... BUT:
It appears the card needs to be in the phone for this to work, and I'm
almost positive 'airline mode' would disable it, because the
transmitter/receiver in the phone is disabled, because the CIA (or
whomever) just doesn't have enough excuses if planes keep crashing into
mountainsides due to Cellphone RF interfering with their electronic nav
gear so the CIA can get the contact list and pussy pics from you sim card.

Right. The REMOVABLE sim card needs to be phone powered and even flight
mode would kill anyone's ability to R/w access the card's data. What
happens when the phone is powered on? Well that's why they're called
"Smartphones"... because they're smarter than the typical user.
Unless you expect an immediate drone strike as soon as they geo-locate
seconds after the first cellsite polls your phone, you buy a burner
android from tracphone or Virginmobile at your nearest 7-11. Use it, and
burn it. IF what you're doing is so fucking important and secretive, you
can afford the $29.95.

America never had a revolution. Revolutions are based on ideology. Greed
is NOT an ideology.
Ben Franklin on the roots of that Greed:
"Sir, there are two passions which have a powerful influence on the
affairs of men. These are ambition and avarice; the love of power, and
the love of money. Separately each of these has great force in prompting
men to action; but when united in view of the same object, they have in
many minds the most violent effects.
Place before the eyes of such men, a post of honor that shall be at the
same time a place of profit, and they will move heaven and earth to
obtain it. The vast number of such places it is that renders the British
Government so tempestuous. The struggles for them are the true sources
of all these factions which are perpetually dividing the Nation,
distracting its Councils, hurrying sometimes into fruitless and
mischievous wars, and often compelling a submission to dishonorable
terms of peace.
And of what kind are the men that will strive for this profitable
pre-eminence, through all the bustle of cabal, the heat of contention,
the infinite mutual abuse of parties, tearing to pieces the best of
characters? It will not be the wise and moderate; the Iovers of peace
and good order, the men fittest for the trust. It will be the bold and
the violent, the men of strong passions and indefatigable activity in
their selfish pursuits.
These will thrust themselves into your Government and be your rulers.
And these too will be mistaken in the expected happiness of their
situation: For their vanquished competitors of the same spirit, and from
the aame motives will perpetually be endeavoring to distress their
administration, thwart their measures, and render them odious to the
people." ~Benjamin Franklin, Opposition to Executive Salaries,

charge worked up which is normally impossible. You can't convict cops
for murder because:
"The law that authorizes federal criminal civil rights charges against
police officers says that in a homicide case ... a police officer can be
guilty only if he not only violated the victim’s Fourth Amendment right
to be free from excessive force, ***but the officer also “willfully”
violated that right***".

It IS worthwhile noting the FBI has access to VERY elaborate
psychological profiles the US military keeps on it's soldiers (from day
one). It would be a lot easier for the FBI setup operators to work a US
soldier, than on some prole muslim at a US mosque.
I'd like to see an FOIA on ANY CONTACT AT ANY TIME the FBI had with the

My dad, A WWII army Colonel, later coordinator for tech writers
(InfoSec) at NASA Huntsville, military NASA...  Later a regional
coordinator for the ADL in the Southeast US until his passing in the
2007 (He stalked the KKK with a bodyguard taking pics of the 'unhoooded'
and passed other racist org intel along), in other words, 'a company
man'  told me a couple of years before he died, with some surprise in
his voice:
    "You know? You kids stopped that war!"
Yes... Yes we did. But NOT before we "Brought the war home", and it
wasn't JUST kids. BTW, he was alive for the invasion of Iraq and DID NOT
LIKE what he was seeing. SOMETHING changed about US Foreign policy in a
way he had not expected and he was looking at Pentagon 'Generals" on TV
wondering if they even knew what they were talking about.
My dad also had his security clearance threatened because of my teen
antiwar activism. THE NYPD's "Red Squad" Capt. Finnegan, the 'silver
fox', and his thugs, got my name after a guerrilla theater action and
bust at NYU's Queens campus and passed it on to the feds who weren't
aware I hadn't seen him for ten years and he had no say over me legally
or otherwise. Now they'd know. And I didn't need Ed Snowden to inform me
the US government spies on, and is scared of, it's own citizens.
Not so sure about Vietnam, an extractive resource war (Tungsten, tin,
rubber, much more incl oil in the Spratlys, S China Sea, that
Halliburton was test drilling for under mercenary and special forces
protection) but later, and now, ABSOFUCKINGLUTELY. The only thing of
value the US produces anymore is weapons systems, and it's hard to sell
them unless they've been field tested.
See this musical informative vid (sorry FB only...Youtube DMCA pulled
for more on that, and no they don't heal them, they let them die... or,
as with 'Psychological Kevlar' pre-treating for PTSD and a bunch of
other stuff, they use soldiers as guinea pigs. It's IN THE CONTRACT.
They PWN you.
I remember seeing pics of special forces guys shoveling Agent Orange
into the hoppers of Bird Dog Cessnas in Vietnam's jungles bare-chested,
without so much as a dust mask. I know a guy who has lung disease... He
was in the Navy. His job was cleaning up ship hulls for repainting. They
gave him basic dust masks but NEVER checked to make sure he was using
it.. Not that the masks would have been effective but.
Hence the title of that video: "The Pentagon: They Eat Their Own"

Occupy Wall Steeet wasn't a focused protest it was a general
insurrection and it was fun but insurrections either disintegrate or
they are crushed. I'm talking about coordinated action on a single focus
with tens of thousands of people in the streets all across the US and
all sorts of side shows like continual sabotage of the system.... The
"Dave Graebers" and other 'vanguard' types were there to fuck everything
up too, but for the most part they has so little control over
organizations that what happened on the street was not what they
intended, but EVERYONE was FOCUSED ON THE WAR.
EVERYONE knew someone killed or maimed in Vietnam, or their GF's brother
was killed there. The US government was turning college students into
cannon fodder with the draft and if your grades didn't keep up with the
continually changing requirements of the selective service... changed to
suit their manpower needs, off you went and your organized religion
wasn't gonna help you either. They'd be glad to pray over your coffin
and call you a hero though.
This is why AUTOMATED WARFARE. It IS most likely the PRIMARY REASON for it
Americans don't like to see the remains of their loved ones come home in
a sack on a C-5a Globemaster and it undermines the Pentagon's ability to
make war.
Want to change things? Anything. It take two traits utterly lacking in
American society at the moment.
Rage and Focus. Richard Nixon may have sat in to Oval Orifice during the
post-Cambodia invasion moratorium as the WH was surrounded by tens of
thousands of people with a pitched street battle between protestors and
swarms of cop on Pennsylvania Avenue.
But he 'blinked', and the US began negotiating... Carpet bombing VIetnam
at the same time with HUGE protests about that too, but within a few
years it was "Helicopters from the embassy roof".

Point taken. That's the way the local city council is populated (if

personal infosec capability to front other whistleblowers without

It's unlikely that what happened to ioerror could be done to him because
A, he's not sub-culturally affiliated, whatever you want that to mean...

Power in the Age of the Feudal Internet
Discussion Papers > Internet and Security > Proposition
Bruce Schneier, Cryptographer and Computer Security Specialist and
Author of Liars and Outliers: Enabling the Trust Society Needs to Thrive
We’re in the middle of an epic battle for power in cyberspace. On one
side are the nimble, unorganized, distributed powers such as dissident
groups, criminals, and hackers. On the other side are the traditional,
organized, institutional powers such as governments and large
multinational corporations. During its early days, the Internet gave
coordination and efficiency to the powerless. It made them powerful, and
seem unbeatable. But now the more traditional institutional powers are
winning, and winning big. How these two fare long-term, and the fate of
the majority of us that don’t fall into either group, is an open
question – and one vitally important to the future of the Internet.
In its early days, there was a lot of talk about the “natural laws of
the Internet” and how it would empower the masses, upend traditional
power blocks, and spread freedom throughout the world. The international
nature of the Internet made a mockery of national laws. Anonymity was
easy. Censorship was impossible. Police were clueless about cybercrime.
And bigger changes were inevitable. Digital cash would undermine
national sovereignty. Citizen journalism would undermine the media,
corporate PR, and political parties. Easy copying would destroy the
traditional movie and music industries. Web marketing would allow even
the smallest companies to compete against corporate giants. It really
would be a new world order.
Some of this did come to pass. The entertainment industries have been
transformed and are now more open to outsiders. Broadcast media has
changed, and some of the most influential people in the media have come
from the blogging world. There are new ways to run elections and
organize politically. Facebook and Twitter really did help topple
governments. But that was just one side of the Internet’s disruptive
character. Today, the traditional corporate and government power is
ascendant, and more powerful than ever.
On the corporate side, power is consolidating around both vendor-managed
user devices and large personal-data aggregators. It’s a result of two
current trends in computing. First, the rise of cloud computing means
that we no longer have control of our data. Our e-mail, photos,
calendar, address book, messages, and documents are on servers belonging
to Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and so on. And second, the rise
of vendor-managed platforms means that we no longer have control of our
computing devices. We’re increasingly accessing our data using iPhones,
iPads, Android phones, Kindles, ChromeBooks, and so on. Even Windows 8
and Apple’s Mountain Lion are heading in the direction of less user control.
I have previously called this model of computing feudal. Users pledge
allegiance to more powerful companies who, in turn, promise to protect
them from both sysadmin duties and security threats. It’s a metaphor
that’s rich in history and in fiction, and a model that’s increasingly
permeating computing today.
Feudal security consolidates power in the hands of the few. These
companies act in their own self-interest. They use their relationship
with us to increase their profits, sometimes at our expense. They act
arbitrarily. They make mistakes. They’re deliberately changing social
norms. Medieval feudalism gave the lords vast powers over the landless
peasants; we’re seeing the same thing on the Internet.
It’s not all bad, of course. Medieval feudalism was a response to a
dangerous world, and depended on hierarchical relationships with
obligations in both directions. We – especially those of us who are not
technical – like the convenience, redundancy, portability, automation,
and shareability of vendor-managed devices. We like cloud backup. We
like automatic updates. We like it that Facebook just works – from any
device, anywhere.
Government power is also increasing on the Internet. Long gone are the
days of an Internet without borders, and governments are better able to
use the four technologies of social control: surveillance, censorship,
propaganda, and use control. There’s a growing “cyber sovereignty”
movement that totalitarian governments are embracing to give them more
control – a change the US opposes, because it has substantial control
under the current system. And the cyberwar arms race is in full swing,
further consolidating government power.
In many cases, the interests of corporate and government power are
aligning. Both corporations and governments want ubiquitous
surveillance, and the NSA is using Google, Facebook, Verizon, and others
to get access to data it couldn’t otherwise. The entertainment industry
is looking to governments to enforce their antiquated business models.
Commercial security equipment from companies like BlueCoat and Sophos is
being used by oppressive governments to surveil and censor their
citizens. The same facial recognition technology that Disney uses in its
theme parks also identifies protesters in China and Occupy Wall Street
activists in New York.
What happened? How, in those early Internet years, did we get the future
so wrong?
The truth is that technology magnifies power in general, but the rates
of adoption are different. The unorganized, the distributed, the
marginal, the dissidents, the powerless, the criminal: they can make use
of new technologies faster. And when those groups discovered the
Internet, suddenly they had power. But when the already powerful big
institutions finally figured out how to harness the Internet for their
needs, they had more power to magnify. That’s the difference: the
distributed were more nimble and were quicker to make use of their new
power, while the institutional were slower but were able to use their
power more effectively. So while the Syrian dissidents used Facebook to
organize, the Syrian government used Facebook to identify dissidents.
All isn’t lost for distributed power, though. For institutional power
the Internet is a change in degree, but for distributed power it’s a
change of kind. The Internet gives decentralized groups – for the first
time – access to coordination. This can be incredibly empowering, as we
saw in the SOPA/PIPA debate, Gezi, and Brazil. It can invert power
dynamics, even in the presence of surveillance censorship and use control.
There’s another more subtle trend, one I discuss in my book Liars and
Outliers. If you think of security as an arms race between attackers and
defenders, technological advances – firearms, fingerprint
identification, lockpicks, the radio – give one side or the other a
temporary advantage. But most of the time, a new technology benefits the
attackers first.
We saw this in the early days of the Internet. As soon as the Internet
started being used for commerce, a new breed of cybercriminal emerged,
immediately able to take advantage of the new technology. It took police
a decade to catch up. And we saw it on social media, as political
dissidents made quicker use of its organizational powers before
totalitarian regimes were able to use it effectively as a surveillance
and propaganda tool. The distributed are not hindered by bureaucracy,
and sometimes not by laws or ethics. They can evolve faster.
This delay is what I call a “security gap”. It’s greater when there’s
more technology, and in times of rapid technological change. And since
our world is one in which there’s more technology than ever before, and
a greater rate of technological change than ever before, we should
expect to see a greater security gap than ever before. In other words,
there will be an increasing time period where the nimble distributed
power can make use of new technologies before the slow institutional
power can make better use of those technologies.
It’s quick vs. strong. To return to medieval metaphors, you can think of
a nimble distributed power – whether marginal, dissident, or criminal –
as Robin Hood. And you can think of ponderous institutional power – both
government and corporate – as the Sheriff of Nottingham.
So who wins? Which type of power dominates in the coming decades?
Right now, it looks like institutional power. Ubiquitous surveillance
means that it’s easier for the government to round up dissidents than it
is for the dissidents to anonymously organize. Data monitoring means it
is easier for the Great Firewall of China to block data than it is to
circumvent it. And as easy as it is to circumvent copy protection
schemes, most users can’t do it.
This is largely because leveraging power on the Internet requires
technical expertise, and most distributed power groups don’t have that
expertise. Those with sufficient technical ability will be able to stay
ahead of institutional power. Whether it’s setting up your own e-mail
server, effectively using encryption and anonymity tools, or breaking
copy protection, there will always be technologies that are one step
ahead of institutional power. This is why cybercrime is still pervasive,
even as institutional power increases, and why organizations like
Anonymous are still a social and political force. If technology
continues to advance – and there’s no reason to believe it won’t – there
will always be a security gap in which technically savvy Robin Hoods can
My main concern is for the rest of us: everyone in the middle. These are
people who don’t have the technical ability to evade either the large
governments and corporations that are controlling our Internet use, or
the criminal and hacker groups who prey on us. These are the people who
accept the default configuration options, arbitrary terms of service,
NSA-installed back doors, and the occasional complete loss of their
data. In the feudal world, these are the hapless peasants. And it’s even
worse when the feudal lords – or any powers – fight each other.
As anyone watching Game of Thrones knows, peasants get trampled when
powers fight: when Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon fight it out in
the market; when the US, EU, China, and Russia fight it out in
geopolitics; or when it’s the US vs. the terrorists or China vs. its
dissidents. The abuse will only get worse as technology continues to
advance. In the battle between institutional power and distributed
power, more technology means more damage. Cybercriminals can rob more
people more quickly than criminals who have to physically visit everyone
they rob. Digital pirates can make more copies of more things much more
quickly than their analog forebears. And 3D printers mean that the data
use restriction debate now involves guns, not movies. It’s the same
problem as the “weapons of mass destruction” fear: terrorists with
nuclear or biological weapons can do a lot more damage than terrorists
with conventional explosives.
It’s a numbers game. Very broadly, assume there’s a particular crime
rate society is willing to tolerate. With historically inefficient
criminals, we were willing to live with some percentage of criminals in
our society. As technology makes each individual criminal more powerful,
the percentage we can tolerate decreases. This is essentially the
“weapons of mass destruction” debate: as the amount of damage each
individual terrorist can do increases, we need to do increasingly more
to prevent even a single terrorist success.
The more destabilizing the technologies, the greater the rhetoric of
fear, and the stronger institutional power will get. This means even
more repressive security measures, even if the security gap means that
such measures are increasingly ineffective. And it will squeeze the
peasants in the middle even more.
Without the protection of feudal lords, we’re subject to abuse by
criminals and other feudal lords. Also, there are often no other options
but to align with someone. But both these corporations and the
government – and sometimes the two in cahoots – are using their power to
their own advantage, trampling on our rights in the process. And without
the technical savvy to become Robin Hoods ourselves, we have no recourse
but to submit to whatever institutional power wants.
So what happens as technology increases? Is a police state the only
effective way to control distributed power and keep our society safe? Or
do the fringe elements inevitably destroy society as technology
increases their power? Probably neither doomsday scenario will come to
pass, but figuring out a stable middle ground is hard. These questions
are complicated, and dependent on future technological advances that we
cannot predict. But they are primarily political questions, and any
solutions will be political.
In the short term, we need more transparency and oversight. The more we
know of what institutional powers are doing, the more we can trust that
they are not abusing their authority. We have long known this to be true
in government, but we have increasingly ignored it in our fear of
terrorism and other modern threats. This is also true for corporate
power. Unfortunately, market dynamics will not necessarily force
corporations to be transparent; we need laws to do that. The same is
true for decentralized power; transparency is how we will differentiate
political dissidents from criminal organizations.
Oversight is also critically important, and is another long-understood
mechanism for checking power. This can be a combination of things:
courts that act as third-party advocates for the rule of law rather than
rubber-stamp organizations, legislatures that understand the
technologies and how they affect power balances, and vibrant
public-sector press and watchdog groups that analyze and debate the
actions of those wielding power.
Transparency and oversight give us the confidence to trust institutional
powers to fight the bad side of distributed power, while still allowing
the good side to flourish. For if we are going to entrust our security
to institutional powers, we need to know they will act in our interests
and not abuse that power. Otherwise, democracy fails.
In the longer term, we need to work to reduce power differences. The key
to all of this is access to data. On the Internet, data is power. To the
extent the powerless have access to it, they gain in power. To the
extent that the already powerful have access to it, they further
consolidate their power. As we look to reducing power imbalances, we
have to look at data: data privacy for individuals, mandatory disclosure
laws for corporations, and open government laws.
Medieval feudalism evolved into a more balanced relationship in which
lords had responsibilities as well as rights. Today’s Internet feudalism
is both ad-hoc and one-sided. Those in power have a lot of rights, but
increasingly few responsibilities or limits. We need to rebalance this
relationship. In medieval Europe, the rise of the centralized state and
the rule of law provided the stability that feudalism lacked. The Magna
Carta first forced responsibilities on governments and put humans on the
long road toward government by the people and for the people. In
addition to re-reigning in government power, we need similar
restrictions on corporate power: a new Magna Carta focused on the
institutions that abuse power in the 21st century.
Today’s Internet is a fortuitous accident: a combination of an initial
lack of commercial interests, government benign neglect, military
requirements for survivability and resilience, and computer engineers
building open systems that worked simply and easily. Corporations have
turned the Internet into an enormous revenue generator, and they’re not
going to back down easily. Neither will governments, which have
harnessed the Internet for political control.
We’re at the beginning of some critical debates about the future of the
Internet: the proper role of law enforcement, the character of
ubiquitous surveillance, the collection and retention of our entire
life’s history, how automatic algorithms should judge us, government
control over the Internet, cyberwar rules of engagement, national
sovereignty on the Internet, limitations on the power of corporations
over our data, the ramifications of information consumerism, and so on.
This won’t be an easy period for us as we try to work these issues out.
Historically, no shift in power has ever been easy. Corporations have
turned our personal data into an enormous revenue generator, and they’re
not going to back down. Neither will governments, who have harnessed
that same data for their own purposes. But we have a duty to tackle this
Data is the pollution problem of the information age. All computer
processes produce it. It stays around. How we deal with it -- how we
reuse and recycle it, who has access to it, how we dispose of it, and
what laws regulate it -- is central to how the information age
functions. And I believe that just as we look back at the early decades
of the industrial age and wonder how society could ignore pollution in
their rush to build an industrial world, our grandchildren will look
back at us during these early decades of the information age and judge
us on how we dealt with the rebalancing of power resulting from all this
new data.
I can’t tell you what the result will be. These are all complicated
issues, and require meaningful debate, international cooperation, and
innovative solutions. We need to decide on the proper balance between
institutional and decentralized power, and how to build tools that
amplify what is good in each while suppressing the bad.

interpolation of some salafist screed about the rules of Goat-Fucking,
Here are some references.
The basic tenets of the religion of hate analyzed...
Also see: Open Letter to al-Bagdadi and ISIS by Muslim scholars from
around the world.
1. It is forbidden in Islam to issue fatwas without all the necessary
learning requirements. Even then fatwas must follow Islamic legal theory
as defined in the Classical texts. It is also forbidden to cite a
portion of a verse from the Qur’an—or part of a verse—to derive a ruling
without looking at everything that the Qur’an and Hadith teach related
to that matter.
In other words, there are strict subjective and objective prerequisites
for fatwas , and one cannot ‘cherry-pick’ Qur’anic verses for legal
arguments without considering the entire Qur’an and Hadith .
2. It is forbidden in Islam to issue legal rulings about anything
without mastery of the Arabic language.
3. It is forbidden in Islam to oversimplify Shari’ah matters and ignore
established Islamic sciences.
4. It is permissible in Islam [for scholars] to differ on any matter,
except those fundamentals of religion that all Muslims must know.
5. It is forbidden in Islam to ignore the reality of contemporary times
when deriving legal rulings.
6. It is forbidden in Islam to kill the innocent.
7. It is forbidden in Islam to kill emissaries, ambassadors, and
diplomats; hence it is forbidden to kill journalists and aid workers.
8. Jihad in Islam is defensive war. It is not permissible without the
right cause, the right purpose and without the right rules of conduct.
9. It is forbidden in Islam to declare people non-Muslim unless he (or
she) openly declares disbelief.
10. It is forbidden in Islam to harm or mistreat—in any way—Christians
or any ‘People of the Scripture’.
11. It is obligatory to consider Yazidis as People of the Scripture.
12. The re-introduction of slavery is forbidden in Islam. It was
abolished by universal consensus.
13. It is forbidden in Islam to force people to convert.
14. It is forbidden in Islam to deny women their rights.
15. It is forbidden in Islam to deny children their rights.
16. It is forbidden in Islam to enact legal punishments (hudud ) without
following the correct procedures that ensure justice and mercy.
17. It is forbidden in Islam to torture people.
18 It is forbidden in Islam to disfigure the dead.
19. It is forbidden in Islam to attribute evil acts to God.
20. It is forbidden in Islam to destroy the graves and shrines of
Prophets and Companions.
21.Armed insurrection is forbidden in Islam for any reason other than
clear disbelief by the ruler and not allowing people to pray.
22. It is forbidden in Islam to declare a caliphate without consensus

My understanding is the Islamic banks have a 'workaround'. Instead of
charging interest you simply owe the loan amount plus whatever the
interest is. If you borrow $100 and the interest is 5% you've borrowed
$105 dollars. Except for the more extreme fundamentalists, it's been
accepted that way for a long time.
No one said "point 5" was gonna be easy...

I really really wanted an Altair when I saw it in a boys life magazine
circa 1967-8 but my parents were NEVER going to shell out that kind of
money so I missed the early days of personal computing.
I started with Basic V1.1 on an Epson HX-20 CP/M laptop in the mid-late 80s.
Wrote a terminal/logging program which I used on BBSs and Packet Radio
that ran  baud that would also spit out a printed log of the radio
contact. I wrote it myself from examples provided in the Epson manual
that was full of mistakes I had to debug and correct.
I went to a Tandy ColorComputer and Basic09, then OS9 L1 and L2
(microware for 68XXX chips)
Then I learned a little C, but before I could dig in there was C+ and
C++ and then...
...and then I figured out unless I was getting paid  for writing code so
I could write them off I simply couldn't afford the INCREDIBLY PRICED
books on the subject... A subject that was changing at lightspeed...
before WWW tutorials etc.
I did pick up enough Jscript to get me in trouble though.
I apologize to NO ONE for not posting directly code-related items. That
IS NOT the purpose of this list according to EVERYTHING I've managed to
find about it historically and suspect it just more feudal bullshit from
people who 'came lately' to the coding world, and as I claimed before,
came for the money.
By the time I figured out there was money to be made. I could already
see, considering I lived in the heart of it, all the psychopaths
flocking to 'the next big thing' and decided I would NEVER EVER EVER do
code work for a living (at least in the US). I was looking at Cisco
books laying around at the Gym when CIsco started up and saw that I had
learned 99% of it playing with packet radio, iNos jNos and TPK.
Fuck 'em. Fuck their money. You can train a CHILD or that guy sitting on
the ground downtown panhandling to do coding. It's NOT brain surgery.

The Weaponising Of Social Part 1: The Crucifixion of IOError
by The Indicter
Thanks to a small group of supposed anonymity-protecting privacy
activists thousands of people now know the name of Jacob Appelbaum’s
fiancée`. Even those that didn’t want to.
We found it out by reading an extremely controversial website launched a
week ago, that had a few sparse accounts of some nasty sounding
happenings allegedly involving Jacob, with promises of more to come.
No one truly concerned with privacy issues should care if Jacob has a
fiancée let alone who she is, out of respect for his right to a private
life and because it is patently obvious that attacks on him shouldn’t
extend to her.
Her name was later removed after the bulk of the damage had been done,
without any editorial admission that it had ever been there in the first
Unfortunately, that simple yet far-reaching invasion of privacy, is only
the tip of the iceberg.
[Update 12/06/16: Detractors are claiming the above is factually
incorrect as they say Appelbaum is no longer engaged. The source was the
smear website itself, which named Appelbaum’s ‘partner’, then removed
her name and called her his ‘fiancée’, and now implies past tense. IMO,
who he is or isn’t engaged to is frankly his own business. The point
In a strange paradox, Jacob Appelbaum’s accusers both want to deny any
relevance between their accusations and him being a known target of the
US government as a result of the nature of his work, while having the
clearly stated aim of wanting to prevent him from being able to continue it.
Even as they are being dwarfed, swept aside and forgotten in the
controversy, the topics on which Jacob Appelbaum and WikiLeaks work are
much larger and more important than any individual.  Those who
concertedly dedicate themselves to such causes are unjustly forced to
quite literally risk our safety, our families, our livelihoods, our
citizenships, our liberty and everything we own, in our fight to
preserve our ideals and our planet.
The high stakes in a situation like this demand more than knee-jerk
reactions, hearsay, and because-all-my-friends-say, when one of us is
attacked or discredited. They deserve the investment of time; of
serious, weighty yet measured consideration; analysis; and
investigation. All of the elements that should be prerequisite to
forming any intellectual opinon, let alone one where reputations and
potentially lives are at stake.
But we are yet to see any of that, at least anything more in-depth than
a series of personal statements via “Twitlonger”. Just a whole lot of
uproar; a whole lot more silence; and a bunch of axe-grinding. With very
little actual analysis, because the topic of rape is so taboo that most
people are shit scared of approaching it objectively.
As such, this post should be subtitled “We Owe IO More Than 600 Words”.
Because we do. We owe him much, much more than that.
We owe it to him and to our causes, to find out the truth.
Preamble dispensed with, I’m going to give some historical context to
what made me write this article and analyse the claims made on and by
the anti-IO website. In Part 2 of this article, we will look into the
main personalities that appear to be driving this, discuss some of the
environmental factors affecting the response and get into the wider
context, which is all but being ignored
Lessons Long-Since Learned
The website now being widely sourced as justification for dismantling
Appelbaum’s career and reputation does as much to discredit itself as it
does to discredit Jacob.
That the name of the female closest to him was disclosed in a forum that
claims to exist to protect women was not the first red flag.
Several years ago, a situation unfolded where a prominent activist
(Activist A)  was privately accused of rape by another activist
(Activist B). This was then broadcast far and wide through the creation
of a Twitter account that purported to be Activist B talking directly
and openly about her first hand experience of being raped by Activist A.
Many fell for it, and instantaneously an online frenzy was being whisked
up against Activist A. For all the same – on the surface – seemingly
valid reasons that we see people turning on Jacob Appelbaum for now.
However, when I read the tweets of the account calling for the
persecution of Activist A, I innately knew that what I was reading was
not the words of a rape survivor. It came across to me as someone trying
to posture themselves as one, out of empathy and/or indignation, rather
than legitimately recounting an actual firsthand memory of a personal
So I did the socially unacceptable but morally right thing and spoke
out. While people were aghast that I dared to question a “victim” – the
facade soon crumbled and it turned out that my instincts were absolutely
The account claiming to be a rape victim was not Activist B at all. It
was Activist C, her boyfriend, who had (according to Activist B, without
her knowledge) taken it upon himself to impersonate her and attack
Activist A in public after she had raised issues in confidence. There
had been some question of infidelity, she had privately claimed lack of
consent, Activist C had decided that Activist A’s life should be ruined
as a result, and gone public.
Whether or not Activist A ever did in fact rape Activist B got lost in
the controversy of Activist C’s foolish meddling in the entire
situation. Activist A claimed no. Activist B claimed yes. Activist C
permanently obscured the situation by his actions.
So how was I able to immediately identify, on gut feeling, that this
anonymous account claiming to be a rape victim was not a rape victim?
And why did I risk my “social capital” to speak out on such a highly
contentious topic?
Because people who are not survivors of rape cannot competently
impersonate survivors of rape. They think the act itself is the whole
story but it is just a tiny fraction of it. So when they attempt to
concoct the scenario, they always limit it to the specific event rather
than the holistic experience, the emotional journey.
Rape Testimony
Real rape testimony is 20% what physically happened and 80% how it
affected us. It is visceral. It is memories and shapes and impressions
and images. It is sights and smells and feelings, a twisted nostalgia we
would desperately like to free ourselves from but cannot ever. It is
asymmetrical and it evolves. It unfolds. The expression of it is a
cathartic, painful release but a necessary step in the healing.
It is not a telegram. It is not a thematical construct with set form or
submission rules.
They are not a fixed length. Nor fixed sentence structures. They do not
have a statistical linguistic pattern. They are not uniform. They ebb
and flow in proportion to the victim’s telling. They sway and move,
mobile in the outpouring of emotion, of grief.
When multiple examples of rape testimonies are compared side by side,
they don’t conform in any way save in their effective translation of
trauma, of a raw and primal pain.
So when I realised the extent to which the accounts on the anti-Jacob
website do conform and began to note other anomalies, huge alarm bells
started ringing.
Speaking From Experience
As someone intimately acquainted with the plight of survivors, you can
feel inside you when something is just not right with a situation like
this. As a survivor, my personal obligation to other victims and to the
truth has led me to speak up several times in the past – even when it is
utterly humiliating, damaging to my reputation or even outright
dangerous to do so. This is not an expectation I have of others – I have
the benefit of the passage of time, maturity, experience and healing –
water under the bridge – that many others don’t. Thus I spoke out in an
article addressing statements made by the Minister of Police and the
grotesquely poor conduct of NZ cops in handling sexual assault including
my own historical abduction and gang rape. I likewise spoke the
difficult and humiliating truth against the notorious ‘FBI’ snitch Sabu
when he assumed the identity of one of my friends in order to target me
sexually, in an attempt to entrap me. I spoke out about my favourite
publication in the world when a new staffer there published a ridiculous
pile of rape apologist bullshit. I spoke out against the self-admitted
serial pack rapists known as The RoastBusters who weren’t even so much
as arrested after bragging about stupefying and pack-raping dozens of
13-16 year old girls. Then I spoke out against media’s irresponsible
reporting on the issue. And again, when the Minister of Justice used the
plight of the many Roastbusters victims who had received no justice
whatsoever, in order to falsely justify the passage of anti-trolling
Even though it triggered the hell out of me to do so, I attended protest
events, supported movements, and covered live actions in support of
survivors, and in defiance of the repressive tactics wielded by New
Zealand’s blatantly corrupt and incompetent police forces, who so
profoundly fail survivors, and the public.
As faithfully as I spoke out in all those cases, so must I speak out too
when I believe that rape testimony may be being falsely manufactured, or
manipulated, or misrepresented, or used to serve the ulterior motives
and agenda of someone(s) who may not be rape survivors at all.
“Believe victims“, some people say. The key word is not believe. The key
word is victims. Not “believe any two-bit twat(s) who impersonate
survivors and/or edit rape testimony because they have something to gain
by smearing someone all over the net, in the name of other victims.”
Especially when in doing so, knowingly or not, those someone(s) are also
serving the interests of The Empire and damaging movements that people
pay dearly to create, build and sustain. (If you are in any doubt about
this take note that among the first people gloating about Jacob
Appelbaum’s perceived downfall was in fact, Sabu.)
For The Empire, I can assure you, does not give the slightest flying
shit about rape victims, unless they can be used to its advantage. On a
daily basis, it perpetuates and facilitates mass rape all over the
world, while expending tax dollars to cement and maintain all of the
societal and environmental conditions that create rape culture.
The double-edged sword of the taboo of rape was constantly wielded
against Julian Assange and his supporters over the last five years,
albeit with ever-dwindling effectiveness. Allegations of rape against
information activists are a lose-lose situation for us but a ‘win’ for
our enemies, and that is again apparent in Appelbaum’s case. The end
result is a real-life example of why these types of accusations are such
an efficient tool for those wishing to utterly devastate and
incapacitate a perceived rival. It emboldens the targets enemies and
silences their friends. It isolates them and eclipses all their prior
For all these reasons I cannot merely sit silent, or put out an
ambiguous 600-word opinion piece sitting on a fence.
Instead I did what I do best. I read, read, read, read and read more.
Dug, investigated and analysed.
The following, is my findings.

WhatsApp Forensic Artifacts: Chats Aren’t Being Deleted
Posted on July 28, 2016
Sorry, folks, while experts are saying the encryption checks out in
WhatsApp, it looks like the latest version of the app tested leaves
forensic trace of all of your chats, even after you’ve deleted, cleared,
or archived them… even if you “Clear All Chats”. In fact, the only way
to get rid of them appears to be to delete the app entirely.
To test, I installed the app and started a few different threads. I then
archived some, cleared, some, and deleted some threads. I made a second
backup after running the “Clear All Chats” function in WhatsApp. None of
these deletion or archival options made any difference in how deleted
records were preserved. In all cases, the deleted SQLite records
remained intact in the database.

America never had a revolution. Revolutions are based on ideology. Greed
is NOT an ideology.
Ben Franklin on the roots of that Greed:
"Sir, there are two passions which have a powerful influence on the
affairs of men. These are ambition and avarice; the love of power, and
the love of money. Separately each of these has great force in prompting
men to action; but when united in view of the same object, they have in
many minds the most violent effects.
Place before the eyes of such men, a post of honor that shall be at the
same time a place of profit, and they will move heaven and earth to
obtain it. The vast number of such places it is that renders the British
Government so tempestuous. The struggles for them are the true sources
of all these factions which are perpetually dividing the Nation,
distracting its Councils, hurrying sometimes into fruitless and
mischievous wars, and often compelling a submission to dishonorable
terms of peace.
And of what kind are the men that will strive for this profitable
pre-eminence, through all the bustle of cabal, the heat of contention,
the infinite mutual abuse of parties, tearing to pieces the best of
characters? It will not be the wise and moderate; the Iovers of peace
and good order, the men fittest for the trust. It will be the bold and
the violent, the men of strong passions and indefatigable activity in
their selfish pursuits.
These will thrust themselves into your Government and be your rulers.
And these too will be mistaken in the expected happiness of their
situation: For their vanquished competitors of the same spirit, and from
the aame motives will perpetually be endeavoring to distress their
administration, thwart their measures, and render them odious to the
people." ~Benjamin Franklin, Opposition to Executive Salaries,

Welcome to the one party state with two right wing factions. Donald

I figure with Donald Trump, having pretty much destroyed the

siphoning off 3rd party support, Hillary will be the first president in
decades to have a REAL mandate instead of the bogus ones, like Reagan

She will still do exactly what the elite tell her to do. If by some

only a few mil companies had access to .com addresses in the early 70s
to use it. They didn't toy with the machine (just toyed with the idea of
taking an ax to it) but that's about the same time period I first heard
about telnet, ftp, irc.
Ps. Ended up pissing on it and destroying the air conditioning's access

Local PD used one to kill a guy who was already dead about 8/9 years ago.
A cop saw a wanted fleeing felon in a van in a parking lot, approached
the door, gunfire exchanged and he retreated. An hour or two later in
the 'standoff' they sent out a robot to place a concussion grenade under
the van and detonated it. They found out the perp had been mortally
wounded in the initial exchange of gunfire and was dead when they blew
him up.

for murder because:
"The law that authorizes federal criminal civil rights charges against
police officers says that in a homicide case ... a police officer can be
guilty only if he not only violated the victim’s Fourth Amendment right
to be free from excessive force, ***but the officer also “willfully”
violated that right***".

    an amputee who gets meds. They think he's a drug dealer because he's
    kind to the homeless and outcasts andbuys them coffee, gives them
    spare change... and the missing plate gave the police, the
    semi-deputized 'rangers' (muni codes only) and a private patrol

his voice:
    "You know? You kids stopped that war!"
Yes... Yes we did. But NOT before we "Brought the war home", and it
wasn't JUST kids. BTW, he was alive for the invasion of Iraq and DID NOT
LIKE what he was seeing. SOMETHING changed about US Foreign policy in a
way he had not expected and he was looking at Pentagon 'Generals" on TV
wondering if they even knew what they were talking about.
My dad also had his security clearance threatened because of my teen
antiwar activism. THE NYPD's "Red Squad" Capt. Finnegan, the 'silver
fox', and his thugs, got my name after a guerrilla theater action and
bust at NYU's Queens campus and passed it on to the feds who weren't

or otherwise. Now they'd know. And I didn't need Ed Snowden to inform me

Not so sure about Vietnam, an extractive resource war (Tungsten, tin,
rubber, much more incl oil in the Spratlys, S China Sea, that
Halliburton was test drilling for under mercenary and special forces
protection) but later, and now, ABSOFUCKINGLUTELY. The only thing of
value the US produces anymore is weapons systems, and it's hard to sell
them unless they've been field tested.
See this musical informative vid (sorry FB only...Youtube DMCA pulled

Occupy Wall Steeet wasn't a focused protest it was a general
insurrection and it was fun but insurrections either disintegrate or
they are crushed. I'm talking about coordinated action on a single focus
with tens of thousands of people in the streets all across the US and
all sorts of side shows like continual sabotage of the system.... The
"Dave Graebers" and other 'vanguard' types were there to fuck everything
up too, but for the most part they has so little control over
organizations that what happened on the street was not what they
intended, but EVERYONE was FOCUSED ON THE WAR.
EVERYONE knew someone killed or maimed in Vietnam, or their GF's brother
was killed there. The US government was turning college students into
cannon fodder with the draft and if your grades didn't keep up with the
continually changing requirements of the selective service... changed to
suit their manpower needs, off you went and your organized religion
wasn't gonna help you either. They'd be glad to pray over your coffin
and call you a hero though.
This is why AUTOMATED WARFARE. It IS most likely the PRIMARY REASON for it
Americans don't like to see the remains of their loved ones come home in
a sack on a C-5a Globemaster and it undermines the Pentagon's ability to
make war.
Want to change things? Anything. It take two traits utterly lacking in
American society at the moment.

Point taken. That's the way the local city council is populated (if
you're socially to the left of fascists).
One advantage I can see with Schneier is there's someone on the board to
toot their horn if they find or hear about something amiss, and the
personal infosec capability to front other whistleblowers without
blowing their cover  I don't think he has any qualms about doing that
and DOES NOT NEED torproject to be celebrity nor can they really damage
his rep.
It's unlikely that what happened to ioerror could be done to him because
A, he's not sub-culturally affiliated, whatever you want that to mean...
B... He was a hardcore CIA intel analyst and his persec is going to be
uncrackeable by the kind of jokers he might encounter at torproject.

If Juan has something to say that Bruce Schnier doesn't want to hear or

I agree with everything said here. Jacob Appelbaum wears counterculture

when personal computing first got off the ground. Wozniak, Jobs and the
rest would get shit-faced out at the Albatross on Portola while Moby
Grape played. The Chateu up on the summit and Zayante Club were
basically weekend retreats for coders to get away, smoke a bunch of
Killer Local Bud, and decompress before going back to their breadboards
and eye-destroying green-black dot-matrix montiors.
The cops used to pick up bleary-eyed tie-dye shirt wearing local coders
wandering the streets of Santa Cruz early in the morning thinking they
were 'woods hippies' to be harassed.

ON THE OTHER HAND Erdogan could be seen to be setting up a fake coup to

say he's trying to create an islamist state and use the puny,
half-assed, undermined-from-the-git coup attempt by low-level officers

That's also my assessment. Gulen had the misfortune to know a RAND
analyst who was CIA and later vouched for him when his visa was
threatened. But he's no Dalai Lama or the guy who defected from the
Libyan army then spent 30 years living in Vienna Va before the CIA
tapped him to lead the nascent groups that killed gadaffi, or a Manny
Noriega. The fact that his visa was threatened says he's involuntary...
Also note no one was saying he'd be invited to the coup party...

We’re in the middle of an epic battle for power in cyberspace. On one

organized, institutional powers such as governments and large
multinational corporations. During its early days, the Internet gave
coordination and efficiency to the powerless. It made them powerful, and
seem unbeatable. But now the more traditional institutional powers are
winning, and winning big. How these two fare long-term, and the fate of
the majority of us that don’t fall into either group, is an open
question – and one vitally important to the future of the Internet.
In its early days, there was a lot of talk about the “natural laws of
the Internet” and how it would empower the masses, upend traditional
power blocks, and spread freedom throughout the world. The international
nature of the Internet made a mockery of national laws. Anonymity was
easy. Censorship was impossible. Police were clueless about cybercrime.
And bigger changes were inevitable. Digital cash would undermine
national sovereignty. Citizen journalism would undermine the media,
corporate PR, and political parties. Easy copying would destroy the
traditional movie and music industries. Web marketing would allow even
the smallest companies to compete against corporate giants. It really
would be a new world order.
Some of this did come to pass. The entertainment industries have been
transformed and are now more open to outsiders. Broadcast media has
changed, and some of the most influential people in the media have come
from the blogging world. There are new ways to run elections and
organize politically. Facebook and Twitter really did help topple
governments. But that was just one side of the Internet’s disruptive
character. Today, the traditional corporate and government power is
ascendant, and more powerful than ever.
On the corporate side, power is consolidating around both vendor-managed
user devices and large personal-data aggregators. It’s a result of two
current trends in computing. First, the rise of cloud computing means
that we no longer have control of our data. Our e-mail, photos,
calendar, address book, messages, and documents are on servers belonging
to Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and so on. And second, the rise
of vendor-managed platforms means that we no longer have control of our
computing devices. We’re increasingly accessing our data using iPhones,
iPads, Android phones, Kindles, ChromeBooks, and so on. Even Windows 8
and Apple’s Mountain Lion are heading in the direction of less user control.
I have previously called this model of computing feudal. Users pledge
allegiance to more powerful companies who, in turn, promise to protect
them from both sysadmin duties and security threats. It’s a metaphor
that’s rich in history and in fiction, and a model that’s increasingly
permeating computing today.
Feudal security consolidates power in the hands of the few. These
companies act in their own self-interest. They use their relationship
with us to increase their profits, sometimes at our expense. They act
arbitrarily. They make mistakes. They’re deliberately changing social
norms. Medieval feudalism gave the lords vast powers over the landless
peasants; we’re seeing the same thing on the Internet.
It’s not all bad, of course. Medieval feudalism was a response to a
dangerous world, and depended on hierarchical relationships with
obligations in both directions. We – especially those of us who are not
technical – like the convenience, redundancy, portability, automation,
and shareability of vendor-managed devices. We like cloud backup. We
like automatic updates. We like it that Facebook just works – from any
device, anywhere.
Government power is also increasing on the Internet. Long gone are the
days of an Internet without borders, and governments are better able to
use the four technologies of social control: surveillance, censorship,
propaganda, and use control. There’s a growing “cyber sovereignty”
movement that totalitarian governments are embracing to give them more
control – a change the US opposes, because it has substantial control
under the current system. And the cyberwar arms race is in full swing,
further consolidating government power.
In many cases, the interests of corporate and government power are
aligning. Both corporations and governments want ubiquitous
surveillance, and the NSA is using Google, Facebook, Verizon, and others
to get access to data it couldn’t otherwise. The entertainment industry
is looking to governments to enforce their antiquated business models.
Commercial security equipment from companies like BlueCoat and Sophos is
being used by oppressive governments to surveil and censor their
citizens. The same facial recognition technology that Disney uses in its
theme parks also identifies protesters in China and Occupy Wall Street
activists in New York.
What happened? How, in those early Internet years, did we get the future
so wrong?
The truth is that technology magnifies power in general, but the rates
of adoption are different. The unorganized, the distributed, the
marginal, the dissidents, the powerless, the criminal: they can make use
of new technologies faster. And when those groups discovered the
Internet, suddenly they had power. But when the already powerful big
institutions finally figured out how to harness the Internet for their
needs, they had more power to magnify. That’s the difference: the
distributed were more nimble and were quicker to make use of their new
power, while the institutional were slower but were able to use their
power more effectively. So while the Syrian dissidents used Facebook to
organize, the Syrian government used Facebook to identify dissidents.
All isn’t lost for distributed power, though. For institutional power
the Internet is a change in degree, but for distributed power it’s a
change of kind. The Internet gives decentralized groups – for the first
time – access to coordination. This can be incredibly empowering, as we
saw in the SOPA/PIPA debate, Gezi, and Brazil. It can invert power
dynamics, even in the presence of surveillance censorship and use control.
There’s another more subtle trend, one I discuss in my book Liars and
Outliers. If you think of security as an arms race between attackers and
defenders, technological advances – firearms, fingerprint
identification, lockpicks, the radio – give one side or the other a
temporary advantage. But most of the time, a new technology benefits the
attackers first.
We saw this in the early days of the Internet. As soon as the Internet
started being used for commerce, a new breed of cybercriminal emerged,
immediately able to take advantage of the new technology. It took police
a decade to catch up. And we saw it on social media, as political
dissidents made quicker use of its organizational powers before
totalitarian regimes were able to use it effectively as a surveillance
and propaganda tool. The distributed are not hindered by bureaucracy,
and sometimes not by laws or ethics. They can evolve faster.
This delay is what I call a “security gap”. It’s greater when there’s
more technology, and in times of rapid technological change. And since
our world is one in which there’s more technology than ever before, and
a greater rate of technological change than ever before, we should
expect to see a greater security gap than ever before. In other words,
there will be an increasing time period where the nimble distributed
power can make use of new technologies before the slow institutional
power can make better use of those technologies.
It’s quick vs. strong. To return to medieval metaphors, you can think of
a nimble distributed power – whether marginal, dissident, or criminal –
as Robin Hood. And you can think of ponderous institutional power – both
government and corporate – as the Sheriff of Nottingham.
So who wins? Which type of power dominates in the coming decades?
Right now, it looks like institutional power. Ubiquitous surveillance
means that it’s easier for the government to round up dissidents than it
is for the dissidents to anonymously organize. Data monitoring means it
is easier for the Great Firewall of China to block data than it is to
circumvent it. And as easy as it is to circumvent copy protection
schemes, most users can’t do it.
This is largely because leveraging power on the Internet requires
technical expertise, and most distributed power groups don’t have that
expertise. Those with sufficient technical ability will be able to stay
ahead of institutional power. Whether it’s setting up your own e-mail
server, effectively using encryption and anonymity tools, or breaking
copy protection, there will always be technologies that are one step
ahead of institutional power. This is why cybercrime is still pervasive,
even as institutional power increases, and why organizations like
Anonymous are still a social and political force. If technology
continues to advance – and there’s no reason to believe it won’t – there
will always be a security gap in which technically savvy Robin Hoods can
My main concern is for the rest of us: everyone in the middle. These are
people who don’t have the technical ability to evade either the large
governments and corporations that are controlling our Internet use, or
the criminal and hacker groups who prey on us. These are the people who
accept the default configuration options, arbitrary terms of service,
NSA-installed back doors, and the occasional complete loss of their
data. In the feudal world, these are the hapless peasants. And it’s even
worse when the feudal lords – or any powers – fight each other.
As anyone watching Game of Thrones knows, peasants get trampled when
powers fight: when Facebook, Google, Apple, and Amazon fight it out in
the market; when the US, EU, China, and Russia fight it out in
geopolitics; or when it’s the US vs. the terrorists or China vs. its
dissidents. The abuse will only get worse as technology continues to
advance. In the battle between institutional power and distributed
power, more technology means more damage. Cybercriminals can rob more
people more quickly than criminals who have to physically visit everyone
they rob. Digital pirates can make more copies of more things much more
quickly than their analog forebears. And 3D printers mean that the data
use restriction debate now involves guns, not movies. It’s the same
problem as the “weapons of mass destruction” fear: terrorists with
nuclear or biological weapons can do a lot more damage than terrorists
with conventional explosives.
It’s a numbers game. Very broadly, assume there’s a particular crime
rate society is willing to tolerate. With historically inefficient
criminals, we were willing to live with some percentage of criminals in
our society. As technology makes each individual criminal more powerful,
the percentage we can tolerate decreases. This is essentially the
“weapons of mass destruction” debate: as the amount of damage each
individual terrorist can do increases, we need to do increasingly more
to prevent even a single terrorist success.
The more destabilizing the technologies, the greater the rhetoric of
fear, and the stronger institutional power will get. This means even
more repressive security measures, even if the security gap means that
such measures are increasingly ineffective. And it will squeeze the
peasants in the middle even more.
Without the protection of feudal lords, we’re subject to abuse by
criminals and other feudal lords. Also, there are often no other options
but to align with someone. But both these corporations and the
government – and sometimes the two in cahoots – are using their power to
their own advantage, trampling on our rights in the process. And without
the technical savvy to become Robin Hoods ourselves, we have no recourse
but to submit to whatever institutional power wants.
So what happens as technology increases? Is a police state the only
effective way to control distributed power and keep our society safe? Or
do the fringe elements inevitably destroy society as technology
increases their power? Probably neither doomsday scenario will come to
pass, but figuring out a stable middle ground is hard. These questions
are complicated, and dependent on future technological advances that we
cannot predict. But they are primarily political questions, and any
solutions will be political.
In the short term, we need more transparency and oversight. The more we
know of what institutional powers are doing, the more we can trust that
they are not abusing their authority. We have long known this to be true
in government, but we have increasingly ignored it in our fear of
terrorism and other modern threats. This is also true for corporate
power. Unfortunately, market dynamics will not necessarily force
corporations to be transparent; we need laws to do that. The same is
true for decentralized power; transparency is how we will differentiate
political dissidents from criminal organizations.
Oversight is also critically important, and is another long-understood
mechanism for checking power. This can be a combination of things:
courts that act as third-party advocates for the rule of law rather than
rubber-stamp organizations, legislatures that understand the
technologies and how they affect power balances, and vibrant
public-sector press and watchdog groups that analyze and debate the
actions of those wielding power.
Transparency and oversight give us the confidence to trust institutional
powers to fight the bad side of distributed power, while still allowing
the good side to flourish. For if we are going to entrust our security
to institutional powers, we need to know they will act in our interests
and not abuse that power. Otherwise, democracy fails.
In the longer term, we need to work to reduce power differences. The key
to all of this is access to data. On the Internet, data is power. To the
extent the powerless have access to it, they gain in power. To the
extent that the already powerful have access to it, they further
consolidate their power. As we look to reducing power imbalances, we
have to look at data: data privacy for individuals, mandatory disclosure
laws for corporations, and open government laws.
Medieval feudalism evolved into a more balanced relationship in which
lords had responsibilities as well as rights. Today’s Internet feudalism
is both ad-hoc and one-sided. Those in power have a lot of rights, but
increasingly few responsibilities or limits. We need to rebalance this
relationship. In medieval Europe, the rise of the centralized state and
the rule of law provided the stability that feudalism lacked. The Magna
Carta first forced responsibilities on governments and put humans on the
long road toward government by the people and for the people. In
addition to re-reigning in government power, we need similar
restrictions on corporate power: a new Magna Carta focused on the
institutions that abuse power in the 21st century.
Today’s Internet is a fortuitous accident: a combination of an initial
lack of commercial interests, government benign neglect, military
requirements for survivability and resilience, and computer engineers
building open systems that worked simply and easily. Corporations have
turned the Internet into an enormous revenue generator, and they’re not
going to back down easily. Neither will governments, which have
harnessed the Internet for political control.
We’re at the beginning of some critical debates about the future of the
Internet: the proper role of law enforcement, the character of
ubiquitous surveillance, the collection and retention of our entire
life’s history, how automatic algorithms should judge us, government
control over the Internet, cyberwar rules of engagement, national
sovereignty on the Internet, limitations on the power of corporations
over our data, the ramifications of information consumerism, and so on.
This won’t be an easy period for us as we try to work these issues out.
Historically, no shift in power has ever been easy. Corporations have
turned our personal data into an enormous revenue generator, and they’re
not going to back down. Neither will governments, who have harnessed
that same data for their own purposes. But we have a duty to tackle this
Data is the pollution problem of the information age. All computer
processes produce it. It stays around. How we deal with it -- how we
reuse and recycle it, who has access to it, how we dispose of it, and
what laws regulate it -- is central to how the information age
functions. And I believe that just as we look back at the early decades
of the industrial age and wonder how society could ignore pollution in
their rush to build an industrial world, our grandchildren will look
back at us during these early decades of the information age and judge
us on how we dealt with the rebalancing of power resulting from all this
new data.
I can’t tell you what the result will be. These are all complicated
issues, and require meaningful debate, international cooperation, and
innovative solutions. We need to decide on the proper balance between
institutional and decentralized power, and how to build tools that
amplify what is good in each while suppressing the bad.

Hi Zeenan...
You never DID get back to me about where you got that perverse
interpolation of some salafist screed about the rules of Goat-Fucking,
Here are some references.
The basic tenets of the religion of hate analyzed...
Also see: Open Letter to al-Bagdadi and ISIS by Muslim scholars from
around the world.
1. It is forbidden in Islam to issue fatwas without all the necessary
learning requirements. Even then fatwas must follow Islamic legal theory
as defined in the Classical texts. It is also forbidden to cite a
portion of a verse from the Qur’an—or part of a verse—to derive a ruling
without looking at everything that the Qur’an and Hadith teach related
to that matter.
In other words, there are strict subjective and objective prerequisites
for fatwas , and one cannot ‘cherry-pick’ Qur’anic verses for legal
arguments without considering the entire Qur’an and Hadith .
2. It is forbidden in Islam to issue legal rulings about anything
without mastery of the Arabic language.
3. It is forbidden in Islam to oversimplify Shari’ah matters and ignore
established Islamic sciences.
4. It is permissible in Islam [for scholars] to differ on any matter,
except those fundamentals of religion that all Muslims must know.
5. It is forbidden in Islam to ignore the reality of contemporary times
when deriving legal rulings.
6. It is forbidden in Islam to kill the innocent.
7. It is forbidden in Islam to kill emissaries, ambassadors, and
diplomats; hence it is forbidden to kill journalists and aid workers.
8. Jihad in Islam is defensive war. It is not permissible without the
right cause, the right purpose and without the right rules of conduct.
9. It is forbidden in Islam to declare people non-Muslim unless he (or
she) openly declares disbelief.
10. It is forbidden in Islam to harm or mistreat—in any way—Christians
or any ‘People of the Scripture’.
11. It is obligatory to consider Yazidis as People of the Scripture.
12. The re-introduction of slavery is forbidden in Islam. It was
abolished by universal consensus.
13. It is forbidden in Islam to force people to convert.
14. It is forbidden in Islam to deny women their rights.
15. It is forbidden in Islam to deny children their rights.
16. It is forbidden in Islam to enact legal punishments (hudud ) without
following the correct procedures that ensure justice and mercy.
17. It is forbidden in Islam to torture people.
18 It is forbidden in Islam to disfigure the dead.
19. It is forbidden in Islam to attribute evil acts to God.
20. It is forbidden in Islam to destroy the graves and shrines of
Prophets and Companions.
21.Armed insurrection is forbidden in Islam for any reason other than
clear disbelief by the ruler and not allowing people to pray.
22. It is forbidden in Islam to declare a caliphate without consensus
from all Muslims.
23. Loyalty to one’s nation is permissible in Islam.
24. After the death of the Prophet, Islam does not require anyone to
emigrate anywhere.

My understanding is the Islamic banks have a 'workaround'. Instead of
charging interest you simply owe the loan amount plus whatever the
interest is. If you borrow $100 and the interest is 5% you've borrowed
$105 dollars. Except for the more extreme fundamentalists, it's been
accepted that way for a long time.
No one said "point 5" was gonna be easy...

I really really wanted an Altair when I saw it in a boys life magazine
circa 1967-8 but my parents were NEVER going to shell out that kind of
money so I missed the early days of personal computing.
I started with Basic V1.1 on an Epson HX-20 CP/M laptop in the mid-late 80s.
Wrote a terminal/logging program which I used on BBSs and Packet Radio
that ran  baud that would also spit out a printed log of the radio
contact. I wrote it myself from examples provided in the Epson manual
that was full of mistakes I had to debug and correct.
I went to a Tandy ColorComputer and Basic09, then OS9 L1 and L2
(microware for 68XXX chips)
Then I learned a little C, but before I could dig in there was C+ and
C++ and then...
...and then I figured out unless I was getting paid  for writing code so
I could write them off I simply couldn't afford the INCREDIBLY PRICED
books on the subject... A subject that was changing at lightspeed...
before WWW tutorials etc.
I did pick up enough Jscript to get me in trouble though.

IS NOT the purpose of this list according to EVERYTHING I've managed to
find about it historically and suspect it just more feudal bullshit from
people who 'came lately' to the coding world, and as I claimed before,

see, considering I lived in the heart of it, all the psychopaths
flocking to 'the next big thing' and decided I would NEVER EVER EVER do

The Weaponising Of Social Part 1: The Crucifixion of IOError
by The Indicter
Thanks to a small group of supposed anonymity-protecting privacy
activists thousands of people now know the name of Jacob Appelbaum’s
fiancée`. Even those that didn’t want to.
We found it out by reading an extremely controversial website launched a
week ago, that had a few sparse accounts of some nasty sounding
happenings allegedly involving Jacob, with promises of more to come.
No one truly concerned with privacy issues should care if Jacob has a
fiancée let alone who she is, out of respect for his right to a private
life and because it is patently obvious that attacks on him shouldn’t
extend to her.
Her name was later removed after the bulk of the damage had been done,
without any editorial admission that it had ever been there in the first
Unfortunately, that simple yet far-reaching invasion of privacy, is only
the tip of the iceberg.
[Update 12/06/16: Detractors are claiming the above is factually
incorrect as they say Appelbaum is no longer engaged. The source was the
smear website itself, which named Appelbaum’s ‘partner’, then removed
her name and called her his ‘fiancée’, and now implies past tense. IMO,
who he is or isn’t engaged to is frankly his own business. The point
In a strange paradox, Jacob Appelbaum’s accusers both want to deny any
relevance between their accusations and him being a known target of the
US government as a result of the nature of his work, while having the
clearly stated aim of wanting to prevent him from being able to continue it.
Even as they are being dwarfed, swept aside and forgotten in the
controversy, the topics on which Jacob Appelbaum and WikiLeaks work are
much larger and more important than any individual.  Those who
concertedly dedicate themselves to such causes are unjustly forced to
quite literally risk our safety, our families, our livelihoods, our
citizenships, our liberty and everything we own, in our fight to
preserve our ideals and our planet.
The high stakes in a situation like this demand more than knee-jerk
reactions, hearsay, and because-all-my-friends-say, when one of us is
attacked or discredited. They deserve the investment of time; of
serious, weighty yet measured consideration; analysis; and
investigation. All of the elements that should be prerequisite to
forming any intellectual opinon, let alone one where reputations and
potentially lives are at stake.
But we are yet to see any of that, at least anything more in-depth than
a series of personal statements via “Twitlonger”. Just a whole lot of
uproar; a whole lot more silence; and a bunch of axe-grinding. With very
little actual analysis, because the topic of rape is so taboo that most
people are shit scared of approaching it objectively.
As such, this post should be subtitled “We Owe IO More Than 600 Words”.
Because we do. We owe him much, much more than that.
We owe it to him and to our causes, to find out the truth.
Preamble dispensed with, I’m going to give some historical context to
what made me write this article and analyse the claims made on and by
the anti-IO website. In Part 2 of this article, we will look into the
main personalities that appear to be driving this, discuss some of the
environmental factors affecting the response and get into the wider
context, which is all but being ignored
Lessons Long-Since Learned
The website now being widely sourced as justification for dismantling
Appelbaum’s career and reputation does as much to discredit itself as it
does to discredit Jacob.
That the name of the female closest to him was disclosed in a forum that
claims to exist to protect women was not the first red flag.
Several years ago, a situation unfolded where a prominent activist
(Activist A)  was privately accused of rape by another activist
(Activist B). This was then broadcast far and wide through the creation
of a Twitter account that purported to be Activist B talking directly
and openly about her first hand experience of being raped by Activist A.
Many fell for it, and instantaneously an online frenzy was being whisked
up against Activist A. For all the same – on the surface – seemingly
valid reasons that we see people turning on Jacob Appelbaum for now.
However, when I read the tweets of the account calling for the
persecution of Activist A, I innately knew that what I was reading was
not the words of a rape survivor. It came across to me as someone trying
to posture themselves as one, out of empathy and/or indignation, rather
than legitimately recounting an actual firsthand memory of a personal
So I did the socially unacceptable but morally right thing and spoke
out. While people were aghast that I dared to question a “victim” – the
facade soon crumbled and it turned out that my instincts were absolutely
The account claiming to be a rape victim was not Activist B at all. It
was Activist C, her boyfriend, who had (according to Activist B, without
her knowledge) taken it upon himself to impersonate her and attack
Activist A in public after she had raised issues in confidence. There
had been some question of infidelity, she had privately claimed lack of
consent, Activist C had decided that Activist A’s life should be ruined
as a result, and gone public.
Whether or not Activist A ever did in fact rape Activist B got lost in
the controversy of Activist C’s foolish meddling in the entire
situation. Activist A claimed no. Activist B claimed yes. Activist C
permanently obscured the situation by his actions.
So how was I able to immediately identify, on gut feeling, that this
anonymous account claiming to be a rape victim was not a rape victim?
And why did I risk my “social capital” to speak out on such a highly
contentious topic?
Because people who are not survivors of rape cannot competently
impersonate survivors of rape. They think the act itself is the whole
story but it is just a tiny fraction of it. So when they attempt to
concoct the scenario, they always limit it to the specific event rather
than the holistic experience, the emotional journey.
Rape Testimony
Real rape testimony is 20% what physically happened and 80% how it
affected us. It is visceral. It is memories and shapes and impressions
and images. It is sights and smells and feelings, a twisted nostalgia we
would desperately like to free ourselves from but cannot ever. It is
asymmetrical and it evolves. It unfolds. The expression of it is a
cathartic, painful release but a necessary step in the healing.
It is not a telegram. It is not a thematical construct with set form or
submission rules.
They are not a fixed length. Nor fixed sentence structures. They do not
have a statistical linguistic pattern. They are not uniform. They ebb
and flow in proportion to the victim’s telling. They sway and move,
mobile in the outpouring of emotion, of grief.
When multiple examples of rape testimonies are compared side by side,
they don’t conform in any way save in their effective translation of
trauma, of a raw and primal pain.
So when I realised the extent to which the accounts on the anti-Jacob
website do conform and began to note other anomalies, huge alarm bells
started ringing.
Speaking From Experience
As someone intimately acquainted with the plight of survivors, you can
feel inside you when something is just not right with a situation like
this. As a survivor, my personal obligation to other victims and to the
truth has led me to speak up several times in the past – even when it is
utterly humiliating, damaging to my reputation or even outright
dangerous to do so. This is not an expectation I have of others – I have
the benefit of the passage of time, maturity, experience and healing –
water under the bridge – that many others don’t. Thus I spoke out in an
article addressing statements made by the Minister of Police and the
grotesquely poor conduct of NZ cops in handling sexual assault including
my own historical abduction and gang rape. I likewise spoke the
difficult and humiliating truth against the notorious ‘FBI’ snitch Sabu
when he assumed the identity of one of my friends in order to target me
sexually, in an attempt to entrap me. I spoke out about my favourite
publication in the world when a new staffer there published a ridiculous
pile of rape apologist bullshit. I spoke out against the self-admitted
serial pack rapists known as The RoastBusters who weren’t even so much
as arrested after bragging about stupefying and pack-raping dozens of
13-16 year old girls. Then I spoke out against media’s irresponsible
reporting on the issue. And again, when the Minister of Justice used the
plight of the many Roastbusters victims who had received no justice
whatsoever, in order to falsely justify the passage of anti-trolling
Even though it triggered the hell out of me to do so, I attended protest
events, supported movements, and covered live actions in support of
survivors, and in defiance of the repressive tactics wielded by New
Zealand’s blatantly corrupt and incompetent police forces, who so
profoundly fail survivors, and the public.
As faithfully as I spoke out in all those cases, so must I speak out too
when I believe that rape testimony may be being falsely manufactured, or
manipulated, or misrepresented, or used to serve the ulterior motives
and agenda of someone(s) who may not be rape survivors at all.
“Believe victims“, some people say. The key word is not believe. The key
word is victims. Not “believe any two-bit twat(s) who impersonate
survivors and/or edit rape testimony because they have something to gain
by smearing someone all over the net, in the name of other victims.”
Especially when in doing so, knowingly or not, those someone(s) are also
serving the interests of The Empire and damaging movements that people
pay dearly to create, build and sustain. (If you are in any doubt about
this take note that among the first people gloating about Jacob
Appelbaum’s perceived downfall was in fact, Sabu.)
For The Empire, I can assure you, does not give the slightest flying
shit about rape victims, unless they can be used to its advantage. On a
daily basis, it perpetuates and facilitates mass rape all over the
world, while expending tax dollars to cement and maintain all of the
societal and environmental conditions that create rape culture.
The double-edged sword of the taboo of rape was constantly wielded
against Julian Assange and his supporters over the last five years,
albeit with ever-dwindling effectiveness. Allegations of rape against
information activists are a lose-lose situation for us but a ‘win’ for
our enemies, and that is again apparent in Appelbaum’s case. The end
result is a real-life example of why these types of accusations are such
an efficient tool for those wishing to utterly devastate and
incapacitate a perceived rival. It emboldens the targets enemies and
silences their friends. It isolates them and eclipses all their prior
For all these reasons I cannot merely sit silent, or put out an
ambiguous 600-word opinion piece sitting on a fence.
Instead I did what I do best. I read, read, read, read and read more.
Dug, investigated and analysed.
The following, is my findings.

WhatsApp Forensic Artifacts: Chats Aren’t Being Deleted
Posted on July 28, 2016
Sorry, folks, while experts are saying the encryption checks out in
WhatsApp, it looks like the latest version of the app tested leaves
forensic trace of all of your chats, even after you’ve deleted, cleared,
or archived them… even if you “Clear All Chats”. In fact, the only way
to get rid of them appears to be to delete the app entirely.
To test, I installed the app and started a few different threads. I then
archived some, cleared, some, and deleted some threads. I made a second
backup after running the “Clear All Chats” function in WhatsApp. None of
these deletion or archival options made any difference in how deleted
records were preserved. In all cases, the deleted SQLite records
remained intact in the database.

Personally I think having to expose the phone number of a smartphone to
another user to establish a chat is an incredible security risk in the
short and long run and leads to all sorts of metadata harvesting of your
unencrypted info. It appears one should keep a low-budget smartphone for
that use instead of their main number for better persec. I questioned Morgan Mayhem (Intercept's sysadmin/cybersec guy) about
that when he broached how secure signal is (he's one of the developers)
on his twitter feed. Never got a reply.

happens when the phone is powered on? Well that's why they're called
"Smartphones"... because they're smarter than the typical user.

But if you need security. Use a computer you've never used before in a
town or place you've never been before for your secure coms then destroy
it and do the same with the $5 burner phone from 7-11. I figure it would
take at least a 1/2 hour or so before a Predator Drone made it to that
location from the nearest military base so you have some time.
The implication is if you're publicly 'subversive' on the internet in
any way that's really a threat there's no way to secure anything and
you're essentially, as someone once said about 'revolutionaries', a
'dead man on furlough'.

Ps. there's a high probability of metadata being matched to users using
simple search techniques.
A Stanford graduate student has shown just how easily names can be
matched with phone records, contradicting some of the legal
justification offered by federal authorities for the National Security
Agency’s bulk collection of phone data.
President Barack Obama said in June that the surveillance captured only
which telephone numbers were connected to others. “There are no names …
in that database,” Obama said.
Just last week, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), chair of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said cell phone customers had no reasonable
expectation to privacy because the data collected by the NSA because it

But researcher Jonathan Mayer and co-author Patrick Mutchler reported
that they’d gathered thousands of phone numbers from volunteers and
checked various public online directories to link some of the 5,000
numbers chosen at random from their database to individuals.
With “marginal effort,” they matched more than 27 percent of the numbers
using just Yelp, Google Places and Facebook.
They then randomly sampled 100 numbers from the database and ran Google
searches for each.
“In under an hour, we were able to associate an individual or a business
with 60 of the 100 numbers,” Mayer wrote. “When we added in our three
initial sources, we were up to 73.
"Between Intelius, Google search and our three initial sources, we
associated a name with 91 of the 100 numbers,”

I'm not defending "the pentagon's 'anonimity' network." I'm saying, in
so many words, that even the most compromised network still has uses if
you know that the network is compromised. And in the case of something
like tor if everyone used it that would increase the efforts needed to
stalk the network. Even if every node was compromised, sifting through X
packets is more expensive in any number of measures than sifting through
x to the 6th power packets.
My take is dissuading people from using it because it's compromised
destroys what little effectiveness it might have, and as the gubmint
would like, renders it useless.
By that logic, you're the fed Juan.

Facing Data Deluge, Secret U.K. Spying Report Warned of Intelligence Failure
    97 percent of the calls, messages, and data the program had
    collected were found to have been “not viewed” by the authorities.
"The amount of data being collected, however, proved difficult for MI5
to handle. In March 2010, in another secret report, concerns were
reiterated about the agency’s difficulties processing the material it
was harvesting. “There is an imbalance between collection and
exploitation capabilities, resulting in a failure to make effective use
of some of the intelligence collected today,” the report noted. “With
the exception of the highest priority investigations, a lack of staff
and tools means that investigators are presented with raw and unfiltered
DIGINT data. Frequently, this material is not fully assessed because of
the significant time required to review it.”
The problem was not unique to MI5.
Many of the agency’s larger-scale surveillance operations were being
conducted in coordination with the National Technical Assistance Centre,
a unit of the electronic eavesdropping agency Government Communications
Headquarters, better known as GCHQ.
The Centre plays a vital but little-known role. One of its main
functions is to act as a kind of intermediary, managing the highly
sensitive data-sharing relationships that exist among British
telecommunications companies and law enforcement and spy agencies.
Perhaps the most important program the Centre helps deliver is
code-named PRESTON, which covertly intercepts phone calls, text
messages, and internet data sent or received by people or organizations
in the U.K. who have been named as surveillance targets on warrants
signed off by a government minister.
A top-secret 2009 study found that, in one six-month period, the PRESTON
program had intercepted more than 5 million communications. Remarkably,
97 percent of the calls, messages, and data it had collected were found
to have been “not viewed” by the authorities.
The authors of the study were alarmed because PRESTON was supposedly
focused on known suspects, and yet most of the communications it was
monitoring appeared to be getting ignored — meaning crucial intelligence
could have been missed.
“Only a small proportion of the Preston Traffic is viewed,” they noted.
“This is of concern as the collection is all warranted.”

COMPROMISED, it WOULD break them, and their respective country's treasury.

perhaps BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT! It’s the end result of “The Politics of

For a start, and for your information, the Wounded Knee Massacre of Natives on this continent was the largest Mass Murder in US history.
I wonder how THEY ‘gender-identified’?
Unfortunately for the FBI, the nightmare in Orlando isn’t turning out to
 be the perfect recruiting tool to get LGBTs to practice their newfound 'liberation’ joining them in spying on their own citizens or recruiting in an imperial military, but I suspect there WILL be a rush to join in the slaughter of dark-skinned people in faraway places by the completely
 ignorant .
But let me get to the point here. It’s a point I’ve made repeatedly over
 the years. What happened in Orlando is the end result of a nation that keeps out ECONOMIC IMMIGRANTS but LOVES to bring home their thugs.
ARVN soldiers, who later terrorized their own communities with Military-style home-invasion robberies. The people they victimized in San Jose California were too scared to talk to the police who admitted they couldn’t protect them.
Iraq & Afghan interpreters who worked with the CIA and various contractors like Caci (G4s, the shooter’s employer /does interpreting-interrogation work too
 to 'interpret’ the screams of their tortured fellow citizens for the US
 intelligence community. Sometimes, a LOT of the time, they even end up the victims of stings by the organizations who paid them to spy on their
 own communities in the US. Many are… Umn… 'less-than-bright’. I feel ZERO sympathy for them except for the fact/those folks are often literally 'morons
Right now, the Defense Language institute would LOVE to have you visit Monterey California if you’re a Pashtun speaker, or speaker of obscure dialects unique to South and Central Asia. Hell they even have BUS SERVICE developed for those folks to commute from other cities in the area like my town!
Then there’s Chechens who fought our dirty terror war against Russia in the 90s and their families. The Tsarnaevs immediately come to mind. Former CIA director/Porter Goss on that dirty war you never heard of
Colombian & Guamanian mercs who worked for the Pentagon in Iraq and Afghanistan in return for citizenship status.
AM I making my point for you? Stop making this about LGBTs. It’s NOT about ‪‎LGBT‬-s!
The VICTIMS WERE perhaps ‪Gay‬-identified, but it’s REALLY THE CHICKENS COMING HOME TO ROOST
 folks… YOU ALLOW the thugs to be protected and nurtured but people with
 drive ambition and the willingness to work hard are rejected… Sent back
 to their countries often to be tortured and killed… FOR YOUR WAY OF LIFE and the continuation of it … AND IT IS KILLING YOU NOW. It’s the end result of “The Politics of a Perpetrator Population”. You are becoming the victims of your own murderous way of interacting with the rest of the world that you as Americans seem so oblivious to … So oblivious that you’d actually think about electing a warmonger like Bernie Sanders as some sort of alternative.

U.S. District Judge Robert Bryan ordered the FBI to produce
            the full code of its malware.
            The government refused.
            I’m not making that up.
            A federal judge told the government to do something and the
            FBI essentially said, “How you gonna make me?”
            This is not good.
    I thought Apple had a really solid argument for refusing to help the
    government hack into one of their phones that was used by the San
    Bernardino shooter. The government eventually figured out how to do
    it without Apple’s help, but I don’t think a company should be
    forced to break its own system.
    Same goes for the government. I don’t think the government should be
    compelled to reveal its code for catching criminals. Don’t get me
    wrong, I do think the government should be compelled to reveal that
    it has a code or a hack or some malware that allows it to spy on us.
    I think they should have to explain in plain English how it works,
    and I think we should be able to have a national, public
    conversation about whether or not we want to the government to have
    this kind of power. But I see limited upside in forcing the
    government to reveal the actual code for its software, if it doesn’t
    want to and reasonably believes that revealing the code would do
    real harm.
    However, there are consequences to that position. If the government
    obtains evidence against you, you have the right to know how they
    did it. If the government doesn’t want to reveal that to you, well,
    then you get to take a walk. That might sound “unfair” to the vast
    majority of Americans who would trade seemingly all their liberties
    for a little enhanced security, but the Fourth Amendment is there to
    protect you from the government even when you don’t know you need
    protecting.
    All of these competing interests are coming to a head in a
    Washington case involving an alleged child pornographer. The FBI
    obtained evidence against Jay Michaud, a local teacher, by placing
    malware on a Tor site frequented by “dark web” users.
    Michaud’s attorneys would like to see the code used by the
    government to gather evidence against their client. Normally, that’s
    a pretty standard and reasonable request. Unfortunately, other dark
    web users would also really like to know how the FBI is catching
    them. Getting their hands on the code would be huge. Even if the
    code is produced in “sealed” documents, we can’t pretend that we
    live in a leak-free world.
    U.S. District Judge Robert Bryan ordered the FBI to produce the full
    code of its malware.
    The government refused.
    I’m not making that up.
    A federal judge told the government to do something and the FBI
    essentially said, “How you gonna make me?”
    This is not good. This is a borderline constitutional crisis. In
    response, Judge Bryan tossed the evidence against Michaud obtained
    by the malware, but allowed the case to continue. On Simple Justice,
    Scott Greenfield has written passionately about how Judge Bryan
    caved to pressure from the executive branch.
    (Judge Kneels And Welcomes His Governmental Overlords link)
    I don’t think the FBI should be compelled to release its code. I’m
    reminded of when the Allies broke the Enigma code, a story recently
    popularized in the movie The Imitation Game. Once we broke the
    German code, we didn’t stop every attack we knew was coming.
    Preserving the hack was more important than preventing individual
    losses. People died because we didn’t want to reveal what we had.
    There were consequences to our decision.
    Here, Judge Bryan should have tossed the whole case against Michaud.
    That should be the consequence of the FBI’s decision. Yes, that
    means one alleged child pornographer and teacher goes free. Yes,
    that is unfortunate. But if the FBI really wants to protect its
    code, then they should be willing to give up this one guy for all of
    the information they are getting through using this hack.
    It’s a difficult decision, but if the FBI and Judge Bryan don’t want
    to make it, they should get into the cupcake business and leave the
    balancing of liberty and security to sterner men and women.
    Prosecute the alleged criminal under the agreed upon rules that are
    there to protect all of us, or do not. There is no try.

Ps. there's a high probability of metadata being matched to users using
simple search techniques.
A Stanford graduate student has shown just how easily names can be
matched with phone records, contradicting some of the legal
justification offered by federal authorities for the National Security
Agency’s bulk collection of phone data.
President Barack Obama said in June that the surveillance captured only
which telephone numbers were connected to others. “There are no names …
in that database,” Obama said.
Just last week, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), chair of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said cell phone customers had no reasonable
expectation to privacy because the data collected by the NSA because it
did not contain their names.
But researcher Jonathan Mayer and co-author Patrick Mutchler reported
that they’d gathered thousands of phone numbers from volunteers and
checked various public online directories to link some of the 5,000
numbers chosen at random from their database to individuals.
With “marginal effort,” they matched more than 27 percent of the numbers
using just Yelp, Google Places and Facebook.
They then randomly sampled 100 numbers from the database and ran Google
searches for each.
“In under an hour, we were able to associate an individual or a business
with 60 of the 100 numbers,” Mayer wrote. “When we added in our three
initial sources, we were up to 73.
"Between Intelius, Google search and our three initial sources, we
associated a name with 91 of the 100 numbers,”

I'm not defending "the pentagon's 'anonimity' network." I'm saying, in
so many words, that even the most compromised network still has uses if
you know that the network is compromised. And in the case of something
like tor if everyone used it that would increase the efforts needed to
stalk the network. Even if every node was compromised, sifting through X
packets is more expensive in any number of measures than sifting through
x to the 6th power packets.
My take is dissuading people from using it because it's compromised
destroys what little effectiveness it might have, and as the gubmint

Facing Data Deluge, Secret U.K. Spying Report Warned of Intelligence Failure
    97 percent of the calls, messages, and data the program had
    collected were found to have been “not viewed” by the authorities.
"The amount of data being collected, however, proved difficult for MI5
to handle. In March 2010, in another secret report, concerns were
reiterated about the agency’s difficulties processing the material it
was harvesting. “There is an imbalance between collection and
exploitation capabilities, resulting in a failure to make effective use
of some of the intelligence collected today,” the report noted. “With
the exception of the highest priority investigations, a lack of staff
and tools means that investigators are presented with raw and unfiltered
DIGINT data. Frequently, this material is not fully assessed because of
the significant time required to review it.”
The problem was not unique to MI5.
Many of the agency’s larger-scale surveillance operations were being
conducted in coordination with the National Technical Assistance Centre,
a unit of the electronic eavesdropping agency Government Communications
Headquarters, better known as GCHQ.
The Centre plays a vital but little-known role. One of its main
functions is to act as a kind of intermediary, managing the highly
sensitive data-sharing relationships that exist among British
telecommunications companies and law enforcement and spy agencies.
Perhaps the most important program the Centre helps deliver is
code-named PRESTON, which covertly intercepts phone calls, text
messages, and internet data sent or received by people or organizations
in the U.K. who have been named as surveillance targets on warrants
signed off by a government minister.
A top-secret 2009 study found that, in one six-month period, the PRESTON
program had intercepted more than 5 million communications. Remarkably,
97 percent of the calls, messages, and data it had collected were found
to have been “not viewed” by the authorities.
The authors of the study were alarmed because PRESTON was supposedly
focused on known suspects, and yet most of the communications it was
monitoring appeared to be getting ignored — meaning crucial intelligence
could have been missed.
“Only a small proportion of the Preston Traffic is viewed,” they noted.
“This is of concern as the collection is all warranted.”

Right now, the Defense Language institute would LOVE to have you visit Monterey California if you’re a Pashtun speaker, or speaker of obscure dialects unique to South and Central Asia. Hell they even have BUS SERVICE developed for those folks to commute from other cities in the area like my town!

Colombian & Guamanian mercs who worked for the Pentagon in Iraq and Afghanistan in return for citizenship status.
AM I making my point for you? Stop making this about LGBTs. It’s NOT about ‪‎LGBT‬-s!
The VICTIMS WERE perhaps ‪Gay‬-identified, but it’s REALLY THE CHICKENS COMING HOME TO ROOST
 folks… YOU ALLOW the thugs to be protected and nurtured but people with

U.S. District Judge Robert Bryan ordered the FBI to produce
            the full code of its malware.
            The government refused.
            I’m not making that up.
            A federal judge told the government to do something and the
            FBI essentially said, “How you gonna make me?”
            This is not good.
    I thought Apple had a really solid argument for refusing to help the
    government hack into one of their phones that was used by the San
    Bernardino shooter. The government eventually figured out how to do
    it without Apple’s help, but I don’t think a company should be
    forced to break its own system.
    Same goes for the government. I don’t think the government should be
    compelled to reveal its code for catching criminals. Don’t get me
    wrong, I do think the government should be compelled to reveal that
    it has a code or a hack or some malware that allows it to spy on us.
    I think they should have to explain in plain English how it works,
    and I think we should be able to have a national, public
    conversation about whether or not we want to the government to have
    this kind of power. But I see limited upside in forcing the
    government to reveal the actual code for its software, if it doesn’t
    want to and reasonably believes that revealing the code would do
    real harm.
    However, there are consequences to that position. If the government
    obtains evidence against you, you have the right to know how they
    did it. If the government doesn’t want to reveal that to you, well,
    then you get to take a walk. That might sound “unfair” to the vast
    majority of Americans who would trade seemingly all their liberties
    for a little enhanced security, but the Fourth Amendment is there to
    protect you from the government even when you don’t know you need
    protecting.
    All of these competing interests are coming to a head in a
    Washington case involving an alleged child pornographer. The FBI
    obtained evidence against Jay Michaud, a local teacher, by placing
    malware on a Tor site frequented by “dark web” users.
    Michaud’s attorneys would like to see the code used by the
    government to gather evidence against their client. Normally, that’s
    a pretty standard and reasonable request. Unfortunately, other dark
    web users would also really like to know how the FBI is catching
    them. Getting their hands on the code would be huge. Even if the
    code is produced in “sealed” documents, we can’t pretend that we
    live in a leak-free world.
    U.S. District Judge Robert Bryan ordered the FBI to produce the full
    code of its malware.
    The government refused.
    I’m not making that up.
    A federal judge told the government to do something and the FBI
    essentially said, “How you gonna make me?”
    This is not good. This is a borderline constitutional crisis. In
    response, Judge Bryan tossed the evidence against Michaud obtained
    by the malware, but allowed the case to continue. On Simple Justice,
    Scott Greenfield has written passionately about how Judge Bryan
    caved to pressure from the executive branch.
    (Judge Kneels And Welcomes His Governmental Overlords link)
    I don’t think the FBI should be compelled to release its code. I’m
    reminded of when the Allies broke the Enigma code, a story recently
    popularized in the movie The Imitation Game. Once we broke the
    German code, we didn’t stop every attack we knew was coming.
    Preserving the hack was more important than preventing individual
    losses. People died because we didn’t want to reveal what we had.
    There were consequences to our decision.
    Here, Judge Bryan should have tossed the whole case against Michaud.
    That should be the consequence of the FBI’s decision. Yes, that
    means one alleged child pornographer and teacher goes free. Yes,
    that is unfortunate. But if the FBI really wants to protect its
    code, then they should be willing to give up this one guy for all of
    the information they are getting through using this hack.
    It’s a difficult decision, but if the FBI and Judge Bryan don’t want
    to make it, they should get into the cupcake business and leave the
    balancing of liberty and security to sterner men and women.
    Prosecute the alleged criminal under the agreed upon rules that are
    there to protect all of us, or do not. There is no try.

Stalin to his son: "You are not "Stalin". I am not "Stalin". "Stalin" is

Ps. there's a high probability of metadata being matched to users using
simple search techniques.
A Stanford graduate student has shown just how easily names can be
matched with phone records, contradicting some of the legal
justification offered by federal authorities for the National Security
Agency’s bulk collection of phone data.
President Barack Obama said in June that the surveillance captured only
which telephone numbers were connected to others. “There are no names …
in that database,” Obama said.
Just last week, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), chair of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, said cell phone customers had no reasonable
expectation to privacy because the data collected by the NSA because it
did not contain their names.
But researcher Jonathan Mayer and co-author Patrick Mutchler reported
that they’d gathered thousands of phone numbers from volunteers and
checked various public online directories to link some of the 5,000
numbers chosen at random from their database to individuals.
With “marginal effort,” they matched more than 27 percent of the numbers
using just Yelp, Google Places and Facebook.
They then randomly sampled 100 numbers from the database and ran Google
searches for each.
“In under an hour, we were able to associate an individual or a business
with 60 of the 100 numbers,” Mayer wrote. “When we added in our three
initial sources, we were up to 73.
"Between Intelius, Google search and our three initial sources, we
associated a name with 91 of the 100 numbers,”

I'm not defending "the pentagon's 'anonimity' network." I'm saying, in
so many words, that even the most compromised network still has uses if
you know that the network is compromised. And in the case of something
like tor if everyone used it that would increase the efforts needed to
stalk the network. Even if every node was compromised, sifting through X
packets is more expensive in any number of measures than sifting through
x to the 6th power packets.
My take is dissuading people from using it because it's compromised
destroys what little effectiveness it might have, and as the gubmint

Facing Data Deluge, Secret U.K. Spying Report Warned of Intelligence Failure
    97 percent of the calls, messages, and data the program had
    collected were found to have been “not viewed” by the authorities.
"The amount of data being collected, however, proved difficult for MI5
to handle. In March 2010, in another secret report, concerns were
reiterated about the agency’s difficulties processing the material it
was harvesting. “There is an imbalance between collection and
exploitation capabilities, resulting in a failure to make effective use
of some of the intelligence collected today,” the report noted. “With
the exception of the highest priority investigations, a lack of staff
and tools means that investigators are presented with raw and unfiltered
DIGINT data. Frequently, this material is not fully assessed because of
the significant time required to review it.”
The problem was not unique to MI5.
Many of the agency’s larger-scale surveillance operations were being
conducted in coordination with the National Technical Assistance Centre,
a unit of the electronic eavesdropping agency Government Communications
Headquarters, better known as GCHQ.
The Centre plays a vital but little-known role. One of its main
functions is to act as a kind of intermediary, managing the highly
sensitive data-sharing relationships that exist among British
telecommunications companies and law enforcement and spy agencies.
Perhaps the most important program the Centre helps deliver is
code-named PRESTON, which covertly intercepts phone calls, text
messages, and internet data sent or received by people or organizations
in the U.K. who have been named as surveillance targets on warrants
signed off by a government minister.
A top-secret 2009 study found that, in one six-month period, the PRESTON
program had intercepted more than 5 million communications. Remarkably,
97 percent of the calls, messages, and data it had collected were found
to have been “not viewed” by the authorities.
The authors of the study were alarmed because PRESTON was supposedly
focused on known suspects, and yet most of the communications it was
monitoring appeared to be getting ignored — meaning crucial intelligence
could have been missed.
“Only a small proportion of the Preston Traffic is viewed,” they noted.
“This is of concern as the collection is all warranted.”

"The main part of the papers, thousands of files and mails,

        Worldwide known cyber security company CrowdStrike announced

@_subject: AboveTheLaw - Tor hacks: The FBI Can Keep Its Code, Or Its Criminal,  
U.S. District Judge Robert Bryan ordered the FBI to produce
            the full code of its malware.
            The government refused.
            I’m not making that up.
            A federal judge told the government to do something and the
            FBI essentially said, “How you gonna make me?”
            This is not good.
    I thought Apple had a really solid argument for refusing to help the
    government hack into one of their phones that was used by the San
    Bernardino shooter. The government eventually figured out how to do
    it without Apple’s help, but I don’t think a company should be
    forced to break its own system.
    Same goes for the government. I don’t think the government should be
    compelled to reveal its code for catching criminals. Don’t get me
    wrong, I do think the government should be compelled to reveal that
    it has a code or a hack or some malware that allows it to spy on us.
    I think they should have to explain in plain English how it works,
    and I think we should be able to have a national, public
    conversation about whether or not we want to the government to have
    this kind of power. But I see limited upside in forcing the
    government to reveal the actual code for its software, if it doesn’t
    want to and reasonably believes that revealing the code would do
    real harm.
    However, there are consequences to that position. If the government
    obtains evidence against you, you have the right to know how they
    did it. If the government doesn’t want to reveal that to you, well,
    then you get to take a walk. That might sound “unfair” to the vast
    majority of Americans who would trade seemingly all their liberties
    for a little enhanced security, but the Fourth Amendment is there to
    protect you from the government even when you don’t know you need
    protecting.
    All of these competing interests are coming to a head in a
    Washington case involving an alleged child pornographer. The FBI
    obtained evidence against Jay Michaud, a local teacher, by placing
    malware on a Tor site frequented by “dark web” users.
    Michaud’s attorneys would like to see the code used by the
    government to gather evidence against their client. Normally, that’s
    a pretty standard and reasonable request. Unfortunately, other dark
    web users would also really like to know how the FBI is catching
    them. Getting their hands on the code would be huge. Even if the
    code is produced in “sealed” documents, we can’t pretend that we
    live in a leak-free world.
    U.S. District Judge Robert Bryan ordered the FBI to produce the full
    code of its malware.
    The government refused.
    I’m not making that up.
    A federal judge told the government to do something and the FBI
    essentially said, “How you gonna make me?”
    This is not good. This is a borderline constitutional crisis. In
    response, Judge Bryan tossed the evidence against Michaud obtained
    by the malware, but allowed the case to continue. On Simple Justice,
    Scott Greenfield has written passionately about how Judge Bryan
    caved to pressure from the executive branch.
    (Judge Kneels And Welcomes His Governmental Overlords link)
    I don’t think the FBI should be compelled to release its code. I’m
    reminded of when the Allies broke the Enigma code, a story recently
    popularized in the movie The Imitation Game. Once we broke the
    German code, we didn’t stop every attack we knew was coming.
    Preserving the hack was more important than preventing individual
    losses. People died because we didn’t want to reveal what we had.
    There were consequences to our decision.
    Here, Judge Bryan should have tossed the whole case against Michaud.
    That should be the consequence of the FBI’s decision. Yes, that
    means one alleged child pornographer and teacher goes free. Yes,
    that is unfortunate. But if the FBI really wants to protect its
    code, then they should be willing to give up this one guy for all of
    the information they are getting through using this hack.
    It’s a difficult decision, but if the FBI and Judge Bryan don’t want
    to make it, they should get into the cupcake business and leave the
    balancing of liberty and security to sterner men and women.
    Prosecute the alleged criminal under the agreed upon rules that are
    there to protect all of us, or do not. There is no try.

In light of Apple’s very public battle
 with the FBI over
encryption, John Oliver designed a satirical ad for Apple to help “both
their customers and the government” understand just how hard it is to
protect data.
The host of /Last Week Tonight/ – who last April famously boiled down
the argument about NSA surveillance to its core issue, dick picks
– said he takes Apple’s side, but acknowledged that the company wasn’t
doing a very good job of explaining its position.
Watch the two-minute fake ad here
It’s the last two minutes of the segment, embedded below.
“We’re barely one step ahead of hackers at all times,” a voiceover
actress explains. “So that when you idiots lose your phone, your
information doesn’t wind up in the hands of guys like Gary.” Gary is a
creepy hacker gratifying himself over family photos on a phone he stole.
Apple engineers are pictured panicking and cursing.
“So if the FBI comes to us and asks us if we can undermine our
encryption without compromising everyone’s emails, texts, and
skateboarding videos, this is our response,” the voiceover continues.
“Are you fucking kidding me? We’re engineers, not wizards,” says an

I can't imagine Apple would fire an employee for refusing. AAMOF the
best publicity in the WORLD for them would be if they publicly declined
to discipline or fire an employee for refusing.
        "Apple’s engineers may refuse to write software to break into
        the phone of one of the San Bernardino shooters if the FBI wins
        its court battle with the tech giant, according to more than
        half a dozen current and former employees."
    Apple employees are already discussing what they will do if ordered
    to help law enforcement authorities. Some say they may balk at the
    work, while others may even quit their high-paying jobs rather than
    undermine the security of the software they have already created,
    according to more than a half-dozen current and former Apple employees.
    Among those interviewed were Apple engineers who are involved in the
    development of mobile products and security, as well as former
    security engineers and executives.
    The potential resistance adds a wrinkle to a very public fight
    between Apple, the world’s most valuable company, and the
    authorities over access to an iPhone used by one of the attackers in
    the December mass killing in San Bernardino, Calif.
    It also speaks directly to arguments Apple has made in legal
    documents that the government’s demand curbs free speech by asking
    the company to order people to do things that they consider offensive.
    “Such conscription is fundamentally offensive to Apple’s core
    principles and would pose a severe threat to the autonomy of Apple
    and its engineers,” Apple’s lawyers wrote in the company’s final
    brief to the Federal District Court for the Central District of
    California.

By Roger Fingas   Wednesday, March 23, 2016, 07:04 am PT (10:04 am ET)
An Israeli forensic software company, Cellebrite, is helping the FBI try
to unlock the iPhone 5c used by San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook,
according to a national newspaper.
If the firm succeeds the FBI will be able to drop requests for help from
Apple, reported Yedioth Ahronoth, as quoted by Reuters. The paper didn't
say how Cellebrite was attempting to break into the phone, or what kind
of progress it might be making.

    TLS Certificate Optimization: The Technical Details behind "No
    Browser Left Behind"
    Overview
    Back in early December we announced our "no browser left behind"
    initiative to the world. Since then, we have served well over 500
    billion SHA-1 certificates to visitors that otherwise would not have
    been able to communicate securely with our customers’ sites using
    HTTPS. All the while, we’ve continued to present newer SHA-2
    certificates to modern browsers using the latest in elliptic curve
    cryptography, demonstrating that one does not have to sacrifice
    security to accommodate all the world’s Internet users. (If you
    weren’t able to acquire a SHA-1 certificate before CAs ceased
    issuing them on 2015/12/31, you can still sign up for a paid plan
    and we will immediately generate one to serve to your legacy visitors.)
    Shortly after we announced these new benefits for our paid Universal
    SSL customers, we started hearing from other technology leaders who
    were implementing (or already had implemented) similar
    functionality. At first glance, the logic to identify incoming
    connections that only support SHA-1 seems straightforward, but as we
    spoke with our friends at Facebook, Twitter, and Mozilla, I realized
    that everyone was taking a slightly different approach. Complicating
    the matter even further was the fact that at CloudFlare we not only
    wanted to optimize between SHA-1 and SHA-2, but also between RSA and
    the newer, but less universally supported ECDSA certificates. Solve
    the "optimal certificate" question incorrectly, and the TLS
    handshake will fail — or get explicitly aborted by browsers that
    have deprecated SHA-1 entirely; solve it correctly, and the client
    and server will establish the most performant, secure connection
    available between the two endpoints.
    Certificate Optimization Logic
    After several trillion requests, we’re confident that our approach
    works quite well for CloudFlare’s customers and their visitors. If
    you have taken an alternative approach to implementation, or have
    found any exceptions/potential refinements to our logic, please
    chime in below. We remain committed to withdrawing SHA-1 support if,
    as our CEO said, "a vulnerability is discovered [in our certificate
    optimization logic] which allows some form of downgrade attack—where
    a modern browser can be tricked into receiving a certificate signed
    with an insecure protocol—and the vulnerability cannot be patched".
    TLS Handshake
    Before your web browser can securely exchange "application data"
    such as HTTP GET or POST requests and responses with a web server,
    it must first establish the cryptographic parameters of the secure
    session. This well-choreographed dance, known as the SSL/TLS
    handshake, commences as soon as you click, type, or get redirected
    to a URL containing the " scheme. (The process described
    below also applies to connections from any user agent — not just
    browsers—so substitute "mobile app", "command-line utility", or
    anything else that can communicate via HTTPS.)

Why do you say that?
Because I think the so-called 'sharing economy' is a feudal fascist
That make me a Nazi?
Because Uber's financial backers include scum like Goldman Sachs who I
wouldn't care to enrich?
That makes me a Nazi?
Because they spy on you, the consumer of their services, and don't seem
to do as well 'spying' on their contractors about thinks like carrying
guns, criminal records, and so much more that someone getting in a car
with a complete stranger might want to know?
    A formal complaint has been filed against Uber, the car ride
    company, by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a
    non-profit advocacy group. The NGO says Uber plans to use their
    smart phone app to access user’s locations at all times, and to send
    advertisements to user’s contact lists.
    Uber, a San Francisco-based company, has become worth over $40
    billion in the five years since it launched its app that allows
    anyone to pay for rides from nearby drivers in 300 cities in 57
    countries. Along the way, it has also gained a bad reputation for
    exploiting its employees and even some customers.
    Last September, users were horrified to discover that Uber was not
    only tracking them but boasting about this ability at private
    parties. The tracking system that the company used to follow the
    physical location of individuals was dubbed the “God View” by
    executives…
That's it! I must be a Nazi because I don't like companies that spy on
people full-time for profit.

intake system for a nuclear power plant. I'd guess they can't really put

In light of Apple’s very public battle
 with the FBI over

their customers and the government” understand just how hard it is to
protect data.
The host of /Last Week Tonight/ – who last April famously boiled down
the argument about NSA surveillance to its core issue, dick picks
– said he takes Apple’s side, but acknowledged that the company wasn’t
doing a very good job of explaining its position.

creepy hacker gratifying himself over family photos on a phone he stole.
Apple engineers are pictured panicking and cursing.
“So if the FBI comes to us and asks us if we can undermine our
encryption without compromising everyone’s emails, texts, and
skateboarding videos, this is our response,” the voiceover continues.

    Apple employees are already discussing what they will do if ordered
    to help law enforcement authorities. Some say they may balk at the
    work, while others may even quit their high-paying jobs rather than
    undermine the security of the software they have already created,
    according to more than a half-dozen current and former Apple employees.
    Among those interviewed were Apple engineers who are involved in the
    development of mobile products and security, as well as former
    security engineers and executives.
    The potential resistance adds a wrinkle to a very public fight
    between Apple, the world’s most valuable company, and the
    authorities over access to an iPhone used by one of the attackers in
    the December mass killing in San Bernardino, Calif.
    It also speaks directly to arguments Apple has made in legal
    documents that the government’s demand curbs free speech by asking
    the company to order people to do things that they consider offensive.
    “Such conscription is fundamentally offensive to Apple’s core
    principles and would pose a severe threat to the autonomy of Apple
    and its engineers,” Apple’s lawyers wrote in the company’s final
    brief to the Federal District Court for the Central District of
    California.

By Roger Fingas   Wednesday, March 23, 2016, 07:04 am PT (10:04 am ET)
An Israeli forensic software company, Cellebrite, is helping the FBI try
to unlock the iPhone 5c used by San Bernardino shooter Syed Farook,
according to a national newspaper.
If the firm succeeds the FBI will be able to drop requests for help from
Apple, reported Yedioth Ahronoth, as quoted by Reuters. The paper didn't
say how Cellebrite was attempting to break into the phone, or what kind
of progress it might be making.

@_subject: Cloudflare blogs on their Cert Tech 
Wondering if their cert tech can spoof a cert to look like it belongs to
a site they DNS when it really belongs to them and you've never really
visited the site at all.
    TLS Certificate Optimization: The Technical Details behind "No
    Browser Left Behind"
    Overview
    Back in early December we announced our "no browser left behind"
    initiative to the world. Since then, we have served well over 500
    billion SHA-1 certificates to visitors that otherwise would not have
    been able to communicate securely with our customers’ sites using
    HTTPS. All the while, we’ve continued to present newer SHA-2
    certificates to modern browsers using the latest in elliptic curve
    cryptography, demonstrating that one does not have to sacrifice
    security to accommodate all the world’s Internet users. (If you
    weren’t able to acquire a SHA-1 certificate before CAs ceased
    issuing them on 2015/12/31, you can still sign up for a paid plan
    and we will immediately generate one to serve to your legacy visitors.)
    Shortly after we announced these new benefits for our paid Universal
    SSL customers, we started hearing from other technology leaders who
    were implementing (or already had implemented) similar
    functionality. At first glance, the logic to identify incoming
    connections that only support SHA-1 seems straightforward, but as we
    spoke with our friends at Facebook, Twitter, and Mozilla, I realized
    that everyone was taking a slightly different approach. Complicating
    the matter even further was the fact that at CloudFlare we not only
    wanted to optimize between SHA-1 and SHA-2, but also between RSA and
    the newer, but less universally supported ECDSA certificates. Solve
    the "optimal certificate" question incorrectly, and the TLS
    handshake will fail — or get explicitly aborted by browsers that
    have deprecated SHA-1 entirely; solve it correctly, and the client
    and server will establish the most performant, secure connection
    available between the two endpoints.
    Certificate Optimization Logic
    After several trillion requests, we’re confident that our approach
    works quite well for CloudFlare’s customers and their visitors. If
    you have taken an alternative approach to implementation, or have
    found any exceptions/potential refinements to our logic, please
    chime in below. We remain committed to withdrawing SHA-1 support if,
    as our CEO said, "a vulnerability is discovered [in our certificate
    optimization logic] which allows some form of downgrade attack—where
    a modern browser can be tricked into receiving a certificate signed
    with an insecure protocol—and the vulnerability cannot be patched".
    TLS Handshake
    Before your web browser can securely exchange "application data"
    such as HTTP GET or POST requests and responses with a web server,
    it must first establish the cryptographic parameters of the secure
    session. This well-choreographed dance, known as the SSL/TLS
    handshake, commences as soon as you click, type, or get redirected
    to a URL containing the " scheme. (The process described
    below also applies to connections from any user agent — not just
    browsers—so substitute "mobile app", "command-line utility", or
    anything else that can communicate via HTTPS.)

Why do you say that?
Because I think the so-called 'sharing economy' is a feudal fascist
That make me a Nazi?
Because Uber's financial backers include scum like Goldman Sachs who I
wouldn't care to enrich?
That makes me a Nazi?
Because they spy on you, the consumer of their services, and don't seem
to do as well 'spying' on their contractors about thinks like carrying
guns, criminal records, and so much more that someone getting in a car
with a complete stranger might want to know?
    A formal complaint has been filed against Uber, the car ride
    company, by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), a
    non-profit advocacy group. The NGO says Uber plans to use their
    smart phone app to access user’s locations at all times, and to send
    advertisements to user’s contact lists.
    Uber, a San Francisco-based company, has become worth over $40
    billion in the five years since it launched its app that allows
    anyone to pay for rides from nearby drivers in 300 cities in 57
    countries. Along the way, it has also gained a bad reputation for
    exploiting its employees and even some customers.
    Last September, users were horrified to discover that Uber was not
    only tracking them but boasting about this ability at private
    parties. The tracking system that the company used to follow the
    physical location of individuals was dubbed the “God View” by
    executives…
That's it! I must be a Nazi because I don't like companies that spy on
people full-time for profit.

There were BIG protests when Nixon was inaugurated, and in '72 there was
a counter-inauguration and riot in DC.
Not so much since then...
Here's something I wrote this morning to a person who attended a protest
here... Just a couple of observations of the many I made that informed
me we are Fuck-Ed in more ways than can be imagined:
"I'm sorry you participated in the system of your oppression and didn't
get the oppressor you wanted.
(I'm going to boilerplate that. It'll save A LOT of typing today)
I heard someone speaking say "Don't mourn, Organize".
Listen... Joe Hill would have spit on Hillary Clinton, and Bernie? Hill
would have boxed him down for even using the word "Socialist" in
relation to himself.
The woman who said her family was from Syria spoke PERFECT English as
she cried over her uncle who has to use a cane because of some unstated
war related event. How did THAT happen? Hillary's State Department
happened, and hired the Libyan goatfuckers to create a war in he uncle's
country, while Bernie's baby, the F-35, is having it's wings made by
Syria's enemy Israel... Israel is also one of the prime buyers for the
F-35, that's undoubtedly going to cause a lot more Syrians to need
canes, and body bags.
The lack of critical analysis by the people involved in the march was
astounding, and depressing. Sickening really."
Ps Someone jested on twitter that Hillary supporters were buying assault
rifles canned food and gold en masse, and the 'protest' (really a mutual
grieving session) DID look a lot like a trump rally, Absolutely.

Good size anti-Trump protest just went by the cafe'.
Large. Larger than the anti-Iraq War protests that happened here.
Led by students. Not Prog-libs (who will undoubtedly try to grab
organizational control to repressively desublimate the anger).
MAYBE the feeling their student loans might vanish could drive them as
hard as the feeling they were going to be drafted and sent to Vietnam
did in the late 60s/early 70s. We'll see.
I DO WANT TO NOTE that people should reject the notion that these
protests are 'planned by Soros' as some sort of Oligarch driven 'color
The protests weren't planned.
The ELECTION RESULTS that DRIVE the protests were rigged by them, and
yeah, they KNEW that protests would happen, but that doesn't translate
to meaning they have a speck of control of the results whatsoever.
The rage IS righteous, and NOT misled. IF the protests maintain their
focus on a rigged election bringing a Racist Fascist to power in the US,
SOMETHING might "Break Bad" for the good.

Let's me extrapolate on that... George Soros orgs funds activities on US
campuses including political activities. Usually neutered and benign
political activities. So if the students protest Soros is responsible
right? "Six degrees" is enough... for STUPID PEOPLE to believe shit like
Same right wing trashtalk that the US governmment used to destroy the
phlosophy department of universities in the US 'because they drove the
anti-vietnam war movement' and in the process left students without the
ability to critically analyze what they learn... The logic and rational
thinking classes that replaced them, intended for technical students,
was no substitute.
Locally a Soros org funded an initiative to 'prioritize police
activities' and it passed, and you know... He never fronted the money to
sue the city when they absolute ignored the new rule and created a
packed committee with less than quorum that never ever meets.
That's the "power of Soros". Disruption, and no follow up.

Trump was elected because information we get is ALREADY STUPID-ED DOWN

Where I live it's got both. There's hipsters AND rednecks round these
heah parts... Where most people in the US live there are both.
Further, most of the truly rural areas in America are populated by
immigrants, legal or not, working in the fields or some Armour meat
packing plant in bumfuck getting spattered with bone meal gristle and
blood. Trump WILL give that job to an American. Too bad he won't find
ONE to take it . Driscoll Strawberry mentioned below is classic. They
and the California Strawberry Association ran a PR campaign to get young
white Californians into the fields. The ag law in Cali is 12 hours a day
sunrise to sunset until the harvest is done. No one applied.
Then there are Exburbs... Where the more affluent live. Sometimes they
only go to the office once a week, or month. They like Trump. They're
cutthroat scam artists like him too. Managers that made director and
shit like that.
Then there are some places that look like farms but they really aren't.
The number of true family farms, as opposed to Family as in name, like
Driscoll Strawberry in California with millions of acres snd is really
quite corporate, approaches near zero in the US. Or like the 'The

Pot's not a drug. It's a category of medicine not recognized by
Allopathic medicine. A 'tonic'.
I live in a culture that's full of tweekers and ravers and one thing I
know for sure. Keep at it and the 'permaspin' is almost identical.
(Along with damaged teeth from gritting them. Why DO you think Ravers
developed a whole new adult market for pacifiers?) Never saw that much
permaspin in LSD daze. Most of the people who spun, unless they
otherwise damaged themselves or were caught and institutionalized and
medicated causing it's own sort of permanent nightmares, came back to
Earth eventually. I don't see that with MDMA. the spin is permanent.
Just like Meth.
I also don't understand why, with the advent of "Mushroom kits" etc,
anyone would mess with chemical crap. Compared to Mushrooms MDMA is a
pitiful excuse for a 'psychedelic' unless you really don't want a
psychedelic experience and just want to be, predictably, a 'love puddle'.
The idea WAS NOT 'to get high'. Not to 'bliss out'.
The idea was to experience, and learn.
Abie Hoffman took L, and it caused a great creative surge that caused
him to break from the Civil Rights movement and Saul Alinsky style
politics, 'Grok' on Marcuse, RD Laing, and develop something entirely
different, and very effective, to politicize the unpoliticizable...
Hedonist hippies, into cultural antiwar activists.
That would have NEVER happened if he'd been taking MDMA...  It's a
'control drug'. It controls people's minds it does NOT liberate
them.It's about 'feeling groovy' not 'being the groove'.

Take a quick look at the other people they follow and who follows them to see if they're just middlemen collecting handles for others to market with (Why you'll see in many account's sidebar descriptions "No Lists"). I simply don't want certain accounts to have access to viewing my followers (persec for them and minimizing the potential for spamming or marketing at them b/c they follow me etc), or as I said disabusing the intent of my tweets which should be pretty clear. No magic. I just do a quick check and use common sense and compare some things... Like you can tell something about accounts by their tweet activity.

Regarding 'replies'... If I put your handle at the beginning of a tweet it's directed at you (not a direct message, public and visible in my replies tab). If I put your nick at the end it's the equivalent of a Cc:.
If any character appears before a tweet directed at you (at the beginning), typically a period, one doesn't have to go to my replies tab to see it. It appears on my main time-line. Twitter has been 'threatening' to make all direct replies visible on the main timeline but I haven't seen that yet albeit I have noted that when I tweet a direct reply (without the period in front) it does initially appear on my timeline but disappears to the replies tab on page refresh. I'm not aware of what happens at another user's end if they view my timeline immediately on posting that direct reply but I suspect it's only visible to me until page refresh to allow for ease of access if I'm writing a series of nested replies Such as using up all 140 in text in the reply and leaving it visible temporarily to addend or add a link or somesuch.

Yup. That how the rat-packing part of twitter 'bullying' happens. I've
had that occur on a small scale but I can only imagine a journo or other
public figure having a real problem with it.  You have to visit the
account's page to block (using tweetdeck makes it easier). It can be
very time consuming. My tactic has always been to block the first person
who  or RT'd me but if you're being bullied and getting hundreds of
them it cold take a while to even figure out who was first.
Reiterating  Ben in other words:
Twitter IS NOT a "utility provider", meaning a common carrier. That
requires an act of congress or the FCC just like the procedure cell
phone companies went through in the early mid 1990s when the phones were
still analog, and people were listening in with scanners on convos, and
the customers figured out the phones were really just glorified
walkie-talkies, and the providers went begging congress for protection
from eavesdropping and got it. But not without being required to be
subject to fines for excessive 'dropped calls' and the demand the
providers move to more 'secure' digital transmissions as quickly as
possible, which they were doing anyway for technical reasons.
Twitter is under no obligation whatsoever to provide the service, and if
Twitter simply disappeared tomorrow, tough darts. It can discriminate.
It IS private.... Popularity doesn't change that.

The definition of "Libertarian, and how it plays out in real life are
two VERY different things. Just like the definition of Marxism varies
dramatically from what, lets say, Doug Henwood, Marxist investment
advior to American Lefties and a cruise missile marxist who never met a
US invasion he didn't (initially) support, believes.
I'll stick with empirically observed generalizations when discussing
politics, thanks.
In MY experience, EVERY SINGLE LIBERTARIAN I've ever met (a few decades
ago I got to interview the Libertarian presidential candidate for a
local college paper too) turns out to be an ostensibly socially
permissive republican with the full set of American exceptionalist
traits I despise regarding everyone else om the planet.
Further, Fascists lead you to believe people have rights until your
rights interfere with their sociopolitical needs. That's a US
Libertarian, defined. Libertarian techies are also well known for being
gentrifiers of communities belonging to others... Usually POC, So
they're Fascists. and racist even if you ignore the fact that Uber
drivers OBVIOUSLY don't care to be a 'sharing economy' version of an NYC
Gypsy Cab. OFC you can't tell by looking at their hipster exterior.
They're crypto-fascist and crypto-racist with a helluva set of
rationalization and denial mechanisms.
Ps. The underlying philosophy that drives US libertarians (using
schmucks like Ron Paul as example) dissuades me from believing in such
an animal as an anarcho-libertarian, or even one that actually believes
in democratic systems... Unless it's MOB democracy of course. Ie How
Hipster gentrification 'does it's thing' with utter disregard to the

"socially-permissive republican" is not the mainstream of the Republican
party, economically-permissive democrat IS in the mainstream in that
party if you consider the regulations made DEFINITELY work in favor of
capitalists (employers, financial industry) and not the workers. The
capitalists say that's not true. Regulation hurts them. But "Hurts them"
means it prevents them from having it all.
Ps. You're discussing this with someone who thinks the two parties are
really two right wing factions of a one party state with the belief in
'manifest destiny' and 'nationalist exceptionalism' (fascism you know?)
as ideology.

Libertarians are fine with underpaid labor in the fields because it's
the natural order of things that bright minds with bright ideas, like
(snigger) app designers and database wonks are paid a fortune and the

Their rights.
To one person a 'raise in 'standard of living' means the power doesn't
go out every time there's a storm(rural or suburban), or a new park in
the neighborhood(urban), to  another it's a 1/2 million dollar ticky
tacky condo close to work in a town they don't even live at. Put
succinctly, they don't want to live in your neighborhood. They want to
live in THEIR neighborhood where you USED TO LIVE, and the truly
disgusting part is they have absolutely no concern whatsoever where you
go, as long as it's away.

No. I justify it on the fact that they're the criminals and taxes
appropriately applied are really a form of restitution. If they don't
like it they can hire an army. They can afford it. After all that's how
they robbed the rest of us in the first place.
Thing is taxes aren't appropriately applied. That 50% tax on the wealthy
you speak of doesn't really exist after deductions and writedowns nd
donations of high-heeled shoes to the Haiti relief fund. Right? Some
wealthy people pay less taxes than that guy living in a box in a field.
Actually most wealthy people pay almost nothing percentage-wise after
all the bennies their plutocrat friends write into tax codes compared to
their UNEARNED (as in they didn't actually work or produce anything
useful to society) income.
And then there's sales tax, which rips workers off way out of proportion
to the wealthy.
It's not the tax. It's how it's collected, and certainly how it's
disbursed (almost all of it to the war machine owned or invested in by
the wealthy.)

The scale of the violence is indicative of the company's desperation.
It's been reported in the MSM that the pipeline, even in best
circumstances is going to be a money-loser for investors, Standing Rock
was trending on Facebook yesterday with A MILLION PEOPLE posting on the
topic, and the contract terms call for completion of the Standing Rock
portion of the tarpipe by the end of this year.
About the water cannons... Let's clarify something here... Federal law
requires municipal governments, State governments, and agencies that
serve elderly, homeless and other at-risk-of-exposure citizens to do
everything possible to protect them. You can see that warning on the
National Weather Service Forecasters discussion page for any area of the
US under freeze warning. Spraying people with water... even using a
garden hose, in freezing weather, is a violation of federal and state
laws everywhere in the US.
I'm seeing a certain idiocy in the Stand Rock defender's approach in
that they seem to be relying entirely on bad pr for the company for
their pr. That WILL NOT stop the company from completing the tarpipe. I
even had some idiot on twitter, who speaks as if hes a standing rock
elder but isn't claim that the takedown of one of the munitions
suppliers sites by anon was somehow against the wishes of the SR elders.
The word "Annihilation" gets uses a lot when any other tactic than using
PR gets broached, and IF that's the only approach, they WILL FAIL.

the federal district court under a blizzard of Federal Civil Rights

and his revolutionary freedom-fighter legacy in the world.
(Please bear with me. I have tried to condense all the researched
material, but this is still a lengthy post..well worth the read though)
History can be a very useful tool. The need to always research the
truth, and understand its relevance is the key to defeating fascism
wherever its ugly head pops up. The true revolution is the evolution of
consciousness. If you rely on the mainstream media or utterances of
"elected" U.S. government officials, you will never truly 'see', or
understand, what is happening all around you, nor will you ever break
free of the chains of mental, as well as economic and physical slavery.
Cuba was one of the last colonial possessions under Spanish rule just 90
miles south of Florida. As Spain’s Imperial power was in decline,
Washington had imperial ambitions to expand its influence on Cuba. Cuba
had the potential to produce unlimited profits for U.S. business
interests. Even organized crime got into the picture when they became a
major player in Cuba in the early 1930’s. The Mafia managed to expand
their gaming industry, prostitution and drug trade operations to Cuba to
avoid harassment from the U.S. government [Citation: "Havana Nocturne:
How the Mob Owned Cuba and then Lost it to the Revolution", an excellent
expose of how the mafia operated in Cuba, by T.J. English]. Cuba was to
be their base of operations as they were looking to expand into other
Caribbean nations. During that time, Cuba was under the leadership of
President Fulgencio Batista, a good friend to organized crime, who had
close political ties to Washington and its multinational corporations.
Cuba became a cesspool of corruption, illegal drugs and prostitution
which became a playground for the rich and famous while the majority of
ordinary Cubans lived in extreme poverty. This is an historical account
of Cuba before 1959, a time period that explains why Cuba’s Revolution
was a long time in the making.
We all know the story of how Cuban leader Fidel Castro established the
first communist state in the Western Hemisphere, leading an overthrow of
the corrupt military dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1959, ruling
over Cuba for nearly five decades, and irking the great American
superpower after nationalizing U.S.-owned businesses in Cuba without
compensation since 1960.
What you don't know is what led to it.
The U.S. has been intervening in Latin America since President James
Monroe established the Monroe Doctrine, a foreign policy that prevented
European powers from colonizing any sovereign nation in “their
backyard”. Unable to convert Spanish-controlled Cuba into a slave
plantation to serve the interests of the U.S. against the Confederacy in
1860, the U.S. Congress eventually passed the ‘Teller Amendment’ in 1898
which did guarantee Cuba’s independence but was replaced in 1901 by the
‘Platt Amendment’ which gave Washington the power to intervene in Cuba
if their interests were threatened. By 1908, Cubans who fought against
Spain created a new independent political party but were oppressed and
eventually massacred by the U.S. backed Cuban government.
The Partido Independiente de Color (PIC) was composed of former African
slaves and war veterans of the1896 Cuban War of Independence. The PIC
won enough votes that undermined the ruling liberal party under
President José Miguel Gómez. President Gomez ordered the party to
disband under Cuban law which outlawed any political party based on race
although the law favored white Cubans. The PIC staged a revolt under
General Evaristo Estanoz. However, General Jose de Jesus Monteagudo
suspended constitutional rights and ordered an attack against
Afro-Cubans. The U.S. intervened and sent troops to back President Gomez
and protect its vital business interests. More than 5,000 Afro-Cubans
were massacred by lynch mobs because of their skin color. All
Afro-Cubans were under suspicion by the Gomez regime. Several
successions of Presidents eventually led to Batista whose first term was
benign. His second term was a different story though. Batista created an
anti-Communist secret police to silence the public with violence,
torture and public executions. It is estimated that there were between
10,000 to 20,000 people murdered under the Batista regime with financial
and military support from the Washington.
During Batista’s reign of terror, the "July 26 Movement" organized by
Fidel Castro and other anti-government groups throughout Cuba were
forming a rebellion against the Batista government. Arthur M.
Schlesinger Jr. who was a writer, historian, speechwriter and a Special
Assistant to President John F. Kennedy who worked primarily on Latin
American issues analyzed Batista’s Cuba on the president’s request and said:
Batista was concerned about Castro so he ordered his secret police to
torture and murder people in public to install fear in the population in
case they were considering joining the growing revolution. Batista’s
actions only angered the Cuban people and increased support for the July
26 Movement. Many organizations joined the movement from all types of
backgrounds from the middle class including lawyers, doctors,
accountants and many others united with the poor (who were already
fighting against government forces).
An attack on the Moncada Barracks in Santiago led by Fidel Castro was
defeated by Batista’s armed forces on July 26, 1953, but with the
handwriting on the wall, on December 11, 1958, U.S. Ambassador Earl
Smith told Batista that the United States could no longer support his
government. The U.S. denied Batista asylum and suggested that he go to
Spain. On New Year’s Eve party, Batista told his government officials
that he was leaving Cuba and flew to the Dominican Republic with between
$300 and $700 million according to various estimates. Portugal’s António
Salazar, a dictator allowed Batista to enter his country. By 1972,
Batista settled in Marbella, Spain where he eventually died of a heart
Setting aside the two-faced hilarious irony for a minute, whenever you
hear leaders of the United States describe another world leader as a
"ruthless brutal dictator", invariably it brings to mind several
distinct suppositions. The basic one is that this leader must be someone
who successfully resisted attempts by the U.S. to infiltrate, pillage
and exploit that country's mineral resources. It is the height of
hypocrisy for any American politician, given the brutal history of the
United States, as well as its present ruthless racist practices, to
condemn, or see fit to criticize, the internal policies of another
nation. The secondary one is that the 'offending party' must be one who
defied the U.S. to an exasperating point of submission. Without the
efforts of Fidel Castro, South African Apartheid, as we knew it, would
never have ended. Don't buy into the American false narratives that
"protests" by liberals in the U.S. was instrumental in the fall of
Apartheid. If protesting and marching ever produced significant results,
racism would have been a thing of the past a long time ago. Hell, we've
been marching for hundreds of years.......still marching.
"638 Ways to Kill Castro" is a Channel 4 documentary film, broadcast in
the United Kingdom on November 28, 2006, which tells the story of some
of the numerous attempts by the C.I.A. to kill Cuban leader Fidel
Castro. Fabian Escalante, the former Head of the Intelligence
Directorate, and the man who had the job of protecting Castro for many
of the 49 years he was in power, alleges that there were over 600 plots
and conspiracies known to Cuban agents, all dreamt up to end Castro's
life. Some were perpetrated directly by the C.I.A., especially during
the first half of the 1960s, and others, from the seventies onwards,
made by Cuban exiles who had been trained by the C.I.A. shortly after
Castro took power in 1959.
Directed by Dollan Cannell and produced executively by Peter Moore, the
film, whose subtext is a commentary on the contemporary "War on Terror",
also contains extensive material shot with Antonio Veciana, the Cuban
exile who came close to killing Castro on three occasions over 17 years
(and now runs a 'marine supplies store' in Miami). All these men, the
film reveals, were supported and funded by the U.S. government. At one
point the C.I.A. even sought the help of the Mafia in the hope they
would be able to succeed where so many others had failed. Other
characters in the documentary are Cuban exile Félix Rodríguez, the
C.I.A. operative who trained Cuban exiles for the Bay of Pigs invasion,
and who was present when the Bolivian Army killed Che Guevara in 1967 at
the request of the Bolivian President at the time, and Enrique Ovares,
possibly the first man to make an attempt on Castro's life after he took
power. Robert Maheu is also interviewed, the Hughes associate who served
as liaison between the C.I.A. and mobsters "Johnny" Roselli and Sam
"Momo" Giancana, in another plot to kill Castro, this time using poison
In 2006, the documentary was the center of a controversy surrounding
U.S. Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. In it the Miami Republican, who
had been recently tapped to become the top Republican on the House
International Relations Committee, states "I welcome the opportunity of
having anyone assassinate Fidel Castro and any leader who is oppressing
the people." A clip of her statement made its way to YouTube where the
newsmedia quickly picked up the story. There was a subsequent public
questioning of Ros-Lehtinen's morals and suitability for her job. She
responded by asserting that the clip was spliced together and that it
was taken out of context, but after her account was contested by the
film's director, she eventually released a statement, on Christmas Eve,
accepting that she had made the remark.
It is mind-boggling that America, a country which brutally murdered
upwards of 100 million Native-Americans, stole their land, raped their
womenfolk and children, and all but ethnically-cleansed them from the
face of the earth....a nation which gleefully engaged in a repressive
African Slave trade Holocaust which saw the violent deaths of up to 50
million Africans, and led to the forced labor, and Jim Crow laws that
resulted in the emergence of America as a 16th century global power
through the tobacco and cotton international trade, and continues to
marginalize, exploit, murder people of African descent, and exploit
African mineral resources, till today....a Republic that dropped the
first, and only nuclear weapons on Japan, killing up to a quarter of a
million people within days, and almost that much in the resulting
radiation fallout which lasted years.....a nation that dropped 280
million cluster bombs on Laos, a country with which it wasn't even at
war, a country that has invaded or bombed over 90 countries, would have
the arrogant temerity and sagging cojones to dissect the policies of
another sovereign nation.
Until the fall of the Portuguese dictatorship in 1974, apartheid in
South Africa was secure. There was no substantial resistance anywhere in
southern Africa. Pretoria’s neighbors comprised of buffer zones that
protected the racist regime: Namibia, their immediate neighbor which
they had occupied for 60 years; white-ruled Rhodesia; and the
Portuguese-ruled colonies of Angola and Mozambique. The rebels who
fought against minority rule in each of these countries, operating
without any safe haven to organize and train, were powerless to
challenge the status quo.
South Africa’s apartheid buffer, supported by the United States of
America for economic purposes, would have remained intact for the
foreseeable future, solidifying apartheid and preventing any significant
opposition, but for one man: Fidel Castro.
In October of 1975, South Africa invaded Angola at the behest of the
U.S. government to overthrow the left-wing Popular Movement for the
Liberation of Angola (MPLA) in the soon-to-be independent country.
Without Cuban assistance, the apartheid army would have easily cruised
into Luanda, crushed the MPLA, and installed a puppet government
friendly to the apartheid regime. Afraid of having a government
staunchly opposed to white domination so close to home, South Africa
rushed to prevent self-determination for the Angolans. They were aided
by U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who believed the threat of
black liberation in Africa, which would lead to local control of their
own resources at the expense of foreign investors, could still be contained.
Bear in mind that at the same time the C.I.A. were engaged in another
brutal massacre in South America, intended to eradicate communist or
Soviet influence and ideas, and suppress active or potential opposition
known as "Operation Condor", a campaign of political repression and
state terror involving intelligence operations and assassinations of up
to 70,000 opponents, which started in 1968, but "officially" implemented
in 1975, by the right-wing dictatorships of South American countries. To
understand how an individual, group, entity or State, operates, you have
to think in parallel terms. It will better illustrate the patterns of
action that individual/entity/State operates under. In addition, the
rest of the world was still aghast and in shock over the American
annihilation of almost half a million Japanese civilians. Operation
Condor's key members were the governments in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay,
Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil. The U.S. government provided technical
support and supplied military aid to the participants until at least
1978, and again after Republican Ronald Reagan became President in 1981.
Such support was frequently routed through the Central Intelligence Agency.
South Africa launched an invasion to topple the MPLA and install the
guerilla Jonas Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), the smallest and least popular of the
three groups, as a puppet dictator in Angola. Savimbi, a collaborator
with the Portuguese dictatorship before Angolan independence, was known
for his ruthlessness, terrorism, and hunger for power. An avowed
anti-communist who had already aligned with South Africa, Savimbi would
have made the perfect Angolan facade for apartheid control, and
undoubtedly, had he prevailed, would have been touted by the U.S. as " a
Agostinho Neto, the President of Angola, and distinguished poet who has
led the MPLA since 1962, appealed to Cuba to send troops to ward off the
apartheid army’s invasion. On November 4, 1975, Castro agreed. Several
days later the first Cuban special forces troops boarded planes for
Angola, where they would launch "Operation Carlota".
Research the Battles of Quifangondo and Ebo to fully understand the
impact of the Cuban victory, and how its effects resonated far beyond
the battlefield. More important than the strategic gain, the victory of
black Cuban and Angolan troops against the whites South African racist
army shattered the illusion of white invincibility.
A South African military analyst described the meaning of his country’s
defeat: “The reality is that they have won, are winning, and are not
White; and that psychological edge, that advantage the White man has
enjoyed and exploited over 300 years of colonialism and empire, is
slipping away. White elitism has suffered an irreversible blow in
Angola, and Whites who have been there know it.” [cited by Piero Gleijeses]
Cuba’s 30,000-man strong military intervention in Angola managed to
change the course of that country and reverberate throughout Africa. By
ensuring independence from the white supremacists, Angola was able to
preserve its own revolution and maintain its role as a base for armed
resistance groups fighting for liberation in nearby countries.
The Americans were furious. “Kissinger’s response to Castro’s
intervention was to throw mercenaries and weapons at the problem,”
Gleijeses writes. [Citation: Gleijeses, Piero. Conflicting Missions:
Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959-1976 (Envisioning Cuba). The
University of North Carolina Press, 2002].
The U.S. Secretary of State was afraid that after their successful
intervention in Angola, Cuba would put the rest of the racist regimes in
the region in jeopardy:
“We can’t say Rhodesia is not a danger because it is a bad case. If the
Cubans are involved there, Namibia is next and after that South Africa,
itself … If the Cubans move, I recommend we act vigorously. We can’t
permit another move without suffering a great loss.” [Citation:
“National Security Council Meeting, 4/7/1976” of the National Security
Adviser’s NSC Meeting File at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library.
(pg. 21) Sore losers that they were, after losing the war, in 1978, the South
African SADF massacred 600 unarmed Namibians at a refugee camp in
Cassinga, but the U.S. opposed any sanctions against them in the UN
Security Council as the apartheid government kept up its relentless
fight for survival. Throughout the 1980's Angola was subjected to
various incursions and invasions by South Africa confrontations which
climaxed in the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale in late 1987. With the
military confrontation raging, talks started between Angola, Cuba and
South Africa, with the United States moderating, in London in early
1988. In instructions to the Cuban delegation, Castro reflected on the
South Africans and American mindset.
“The fact they have accepted this meeting in London at such a high level
shows that they are looking for a way out because they have seen our
advance and are saying, ‘How is it that Cuba has converted itself into
the liquidator of Apartheid and the liberator of Africa?’ That’s what is
worrying the Americans, they’re going to say: ‘They’re going to defeat
South Africa!” Castro said. [Citation: Instructions to the Cuban
Delegation for the London Meeting, ‘Indicaciones concretas del
Comandante en Jefe que guiarán la actuación de la delegación cubana a
las conversaciones de Luanda y las negociaciones de Londres (April 22,
Castro also told his delegation that the goal was not to pursue a war or
military victory, but to achieve negotiations over SADF withdrawal from
Angola and implementation of Resolution 435, which would grant
independence to Namibia. “They should know that we are not playing
games, that our position is serious and that our objective is peace,” he
said. President Reagan administration's efforts to seek modification of
United Nations resolution 435 on Namibia to allow South African a say,
received a serious rebuff from Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau
and Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, until eager to keep doing
business with the mineral resource-rich Angola, and surreptitiously keep
funding other brigands in nearby Congo, the U.S. succumbed.
In the American version of Cold War history, Cuba was carrying out
aggression and acting as proxies of the Soviet Union. Were it not for
one persistent and meticulous scholar, we might never have known that
these are nothing more than dishonest fabrications. In his monumental
books “Conflicting Missions” and “Visions of Freedom,” historian Piero
Gleijeses uses thousands of documents from Cuban military archives, as
well as U.S. and South African archives, to recount a dramatic,
historical confrontation between tiny Cuba and Washington and its ally
apartheid South Africa. Gleijeses is the only foreign scholar to have
gained access to the closed Cuban archives. He obtained thousands of
pages of documents, and made them available to the Wilson Center Digital
Archive, which has posted the invaluable collection online.
Gleijeses’s research made possible a look behind the curtain at one of
the most remarkable acts of "internationalism" of the century.
“Internationalism, (or the duty to help others), was at the core of the
Cuban revolution,” Gleijeses writes. “For Castro’s followers, and they
were legion, this was not rhetoric. By 1975, approximately 1,000 Cuban
aid workers had gone to a dozen African countries, South Yemen, and
North Vietnam. In 1976-77, technical assistance was extended to Jamaica
and Guyana in the Western Hemisphere; to Angola, Mozambique, and
Ethiopia in Africa; and to Laos in Asia....all places that had suffered
bombings and illegal incursions at the hands of the U.S.
Even the C.I.A. noted: "The Cuban technicians are primarily involved in
rural development and educational and public health projects... areas in
which Cuba has accumulated expertise and has experienced success at
home." [Gleijeses, Piero. Visions of Freedom: Havana, Washington,
Pretoria, and the Struggle for Southern Africa, 1976-1991. The
University of North Carolina Press, 2013].
The fight against apartheid, for the liberation of people who suffered
for centuries under colonialism and racial subjugation, was truly a
David versus Goliath conflict. In addition to having a strong military
itself and being armed with Israeli-supplied nuclear weapons, South
Africa enjoyed the diplomatic support of the United States, the world’s
largest superpower. Of course, this was because the main industries
propping up the evil Apartheid regime were American corporations. Within
this context, Cuba’s intervention....a poor Caribbean island under
relentless attack from a racist juggernaut backed by the world’s leading
imperial power, is even more remarkable.
Explaining how the significance of Cuba’s role in Angola is “without
 “No other Third World country has
projected its military power beyond its immediate neighborhood. The
engine was Cuba. It was the Cubans who pushed the Soviets to help
Angola. It was they who stood guard in Angola for many long years,
thousands of miles from home, to prevent the South Africans from
overthrowing the MPLA government.” He notes that while the Soviet Union
later sent aid and weapons, they never would have become involved unless
Castro had taken the lead (which he did in spite of Russian opposition):
In Castro's Cuba, $1 could buy half a pint of milk, a month's childcare
for one toddler and a box at the opera to see the visiting Bolshoi
Ballet, and with one of the best healthcare systems in the world, cures
for certain forms of cancer (which currently cost about one dollar in
Cuba), Cuba's defiance, spanning the span of 11 U.S. presidencies,
finally brought America to its knees as President Obama recently
restored diplomatic relations with its hated enemy, after over half a
century of enduring tactics the Gestapo would have been proud of. As
usual, salivating over anticipated profits for Big-Pharma, what passes
for American morality has been superseded by prevalent greed. It didn't
assuage the much-vaunted American arrogance, either, that Russians had
already signed a deal to drill for oil off the Cuban coast where Havana
says there may be 20 billion barrels of oil, although the U.S. estimates
there are only five billion barrels.
So in conclusion, do these actions seem to you, the actions of a "brutal
dictator" who cares nothing for the well-being of people? Whenever you
read, or hear that Castro, or anyone else for that matter, was "a menace
and brutal dictator", do your own research. People all around the world
are lamenting the passing of this bearded revolutionary hero, who
survived a crippling U.S. trade embargo as well as hundreds, of
assassination plots for half a century. Castro overcame imprisonment at
the hands of dictator Fulgencio Batista, exile in Mexico and a
disastrous start to his rebellion before triumphantly riding into Havana
in January 1959 to become, at age 32, the youngest leader in Latin
America. For decades, he served as an inspiration and source of support
to revolutionaries spanning Latin America to Africa. There is not a dry
eye in Cuba, and many parts of the world today, and a 9-day period of
mourning has been declared in Havana. The only ones rejoicing....well,
you know it, the Americans, Cuban exile descendants of the Batista-era
elite, and lapdog governments of France and Britain...as well as those
who, either have something to gain from this news, or lacking historical
context, just don't know any better.
My footnote to the sordid tale of the Portugues-South African-American
pillaging of Angola is that 40 years later, Portugal is broke...and
Angola, crude oil-rich, graciously came to the rescue of their former
brutal colonial oppressor, paying off their foreign debts. That is the
true African spirit. America should borrow a page from the book of
African humanity before it's too late....but in true 'Murices fashion,
are busy draining Namibia of its uranium, Congo of its Coltan, and
Botswana of its diamonds.
Let it be known......Castro was a true hero.

Muni passengers were treated to free rides for much of the weekend after
a cyber attack on Muni's computer network Friday afternoon left
ticketing kiosks inoperable. But the San Francisco Municipal Transit
Agency looks poised to lose more than a weekend of fares, Hoodline has
According to the pseudonymous hacker, the agency's computers are being
held ransom for more than $73,000 dollars with only one day left to
pay—and nearly 25 percent of Muni's network has been compromised.
The severity of the attack still remains unknown to the public. However,
documents released by one of the hackers suggest many vital agency
functions have been compromised, including payroll, email servers,
Quickbooks, NextBus operations, various MySQL database servers, staff
training and personal computers for hundreds of employees.
In all, the hackers claim to control 2,112 of SFMTA's 8,656 computer
In a statement released by agency spokesperson Paul Rose, “The incident
remains under investigation, so it wouldn't be appropriate to provide
any additional details at this point.”
The attack, first reported by the Examiner on Saturday (link), left
kiosks across Muni's downtown stations with a message reading, “You
Hacked, ALL Data Encrypted. Contact For Key(cryptom27 at yandex.com)ID:681
Unable to process fares, Muni left turnstiles open for passengers to
ride freely.Muni's computers have been hijacked using the HDDCryptor
ransomware, which targets Windows machines. Also known as Mamba, the
ransomware encrypts hard drives and requires a password to unlock,
leaving Muni without access.
Reached at the provided email, the hackers, calling themselves “Andy
Saolis,” demanded 100 Bitcoin—the equivalent of more than $73,000—from
San Francisco's transit agency:
if You are Responsible in MUNI-RAILWAY !
All Your Computer’s/Server's in MUNI-RAILWAY Domain Encrypted By AES
We have 2000 Decryption Key !
Send 100BTC to My Bitcoin Wallet , then We Send you Decryption key For
Your All Server's HDD!!
We Only Accept Bitcoin , it’s So easy!
you can use Brokers to exchange your money to BTC ASAP
it's Fast way!
The hackers followed up, writing, “say to company owner we are waiting
one more day for deal and after it this email closing for security
reason!” In another email, they declared, “we only encrypt 2000
important server and PC , another systems don't point to us !”
Andy Saolis—a pseudonym commonly used in HDDCryptor ransom attacks—also
provided a list of all 2,112 machines under their control, as well as a
Bitcoin wallet to which the ransom could be paid. So far, no transfer
have been posted to that wallet, but it is likely the hackers provided
different wallets to each email contact to avoid being easily tracked.
SFMTA's backup servers did not appear to be among the thousands of
impacted machines, which could allow the agency to avoid paying the
ransom and restore their computers from previous copies of their system
data. However, depending on how old the backups are, they still could
risk losing critical information.

country, while Bernie's baby, the F-35, is having it's wings made by
Syria's enemy Israel... Israel is also one of the prime buyers for the

canes, and body bags.

two faction system of 'government'. I for one would like to know how
many PISSED OFF AMERICANS didn't vote for him because they were in

Personal Statement on the Nature and Potential of  Protests
Good size anti-Trump protest just went by the cafe'.
Large. Larger than the anti-Iraq War protests that happened here.
Led by students. Not Prog-libs (who will undoubtedly try to grab
organizational control to repressively desublimate the anger).
MAYBE the feeling their student loans might vanish could drive them as
hard as the feeling they were going to be drafted and sent to Vietnam
did in the late 60s/early 70s. We'll see.
I DO WANT TO NOTE that people should reject the notion that these
protests are 'planned by Soros' as some sort of Oligarch driven 'color
The protests weren't planned.
The ELECTION RESULTS that DRIVE the protests were rigged by them, and
yeah, they KNEW that protests would happen, but that doesn't translate
to meaning they have a speck of control of the results whatsoever.
The rage IS righteous, and NOT misled. IF the protests maintain their
focus on a rigged election bringing a Racist Fascist to power in the US,
SOMETHING might "Break Bad" for the good.

Which protest?
Let's me extrapolate on that... George Soros orgs funds activities on US
campuses including political activities. Usually neutered and benign
political activities. So if the students protest Soros is responsible
right? "Six degrees" is enough... for STUPID PEOPLE to believe shit like
Same right wing trashtalk that the US governmment used to destroy the
phlosophy department of universities in the US 'because they drove the
anti-vietnam war movement' and in the process left students without the
ability to critically analyze what they learn... The logic and rational
thinking classes that replaced them, intended for technical students,
was no substitute.
Locally a Soros org funded an initiative to 'prioritize police
activities' and it passed, and you know... He never fronted the money to
sue the city when they absolute ignored the new rule and created a
packed committee with less than quorum that never ever meets.
That's the "power of Soros". Disruption, and no follow up.
Wikileaks is a disruptor too.
Exactly which protest or all you have is a rumor. I'd point out that
Trump was elected because information we get is ALREADY STUPID-ED DOWN
to the level of rumors = fact.
And you know, my eyes just sort of glaze over whenever I see the "Soros
Trope". It reminds me A LOT of the "Rothchild Jewish Banker Trope" so

More: Beyond that do your own research.
Where I live it's got both. There's hipsters AND rednecks round these
heah parts... Where most people in the US live there are both.
Further, most of the truly rural areas in America are populated by
immigrants, legal or not, working in the fields or some Armour meat
packing plant in bumfuck getting spattered with bone meal gristle and
blood. Trump WILL give that job to an American. Too bad he won't find
ONE to take it . Driscoll Strawberry mentioned below is classic. They
and the California Strawberry Association ran a PR campaign to get young
white Californians into the fields. The ag law in Cali is 12 hours a day
sunrise to sunset until the harvest is done. No one applied.
Then there are Exburbs... Where the more affluent live. Sometimes they
only go to the office once a week, or month. They like Trump. They're
cutthroat scam artists like him too. Managers that made director and
shit like that.
Then there are some places that look like farms but they really aren't.
The number of true family farms, as opposed to Family as in name, like
Driscoll Strawberry in California with millions of acres snd is really
quite corporate, approaches near zero in the US. Or like the 'The

Pot's not a drug. It's a category of medicine not recognized by
Allopathic medicine. A 'tonic'.
I live in a culture that's full of tweekers and ravers and one thing I
know for sure. Keep at it and the 'permaspin' is almost identical.
(Along with damaged teeth from gritting them. Why DO you think Ravers
developed a whole new adult market for pacifiers?) Never saw that much
permaspin in LSD daze. Most of the people who spun, unless they
otherwise damaged themselves or were caught and institutionalized and
medicated causing it's own sort of permanent nightmares, came back to
Earth eventually. I don't see that with MDMA. the spin is permanent.
Just like Meth.
I also don't understand why, with the advent of "Mushroom kits" etc,
anyone would mess with chemical crap. Compared to Mushrooms MDMA is a
pitiful excuse for a 'psychedelic' unless you really don't want a
psychedelic experience and just want to be, predictably, a 'love puddle'.
The idea WAS NOT 'to get high'. Not to 'bliss out'.
The idea was to experience, and learn.
Abie Hoffman took L, and it caused a great creative surge that caused
him to break from the Civil Rights movement and Saul Alinsky style
politics, 'Grok' on Marcuse, RD Laing, and develop something entirely
different, and very effective, to politicize the unpoliticizable...
Hedonist hippies, into cultural antiwar activists.
That would have NEVER happened if he'd been taking MDMA...  It's a
'control drug'. It controls people's minds it does NOT liberate
them.It's about 'feeling groovy' not 'being the groove'.

Yup. That how the rat-packing part of twitter 'bullying' happens. I've
had that occur on a small scale but I can only imagine a journo or other
public figure having a real problem with it.  You have to visit the
account's page to block (using tweetdeck makes it easier). It can be
very time consuming. My tactic has always been to block the first person
who  or RT'd me but if you're being bullied and getting hundreds of
them it cold take a while to even figure out who was first.
Reiterating  Ben in other words:
Twitter IS NOT a "utility provider", meaning a common carrier. That
requires an act of congress or the FCC just like the procedure cell
phone companies went through in the early mid 1990s when the phones were
still analog, and people were listening in with scanners on convos, and
the customers figured out the phones were really just glorified
walkie-talkies, and the providers went begging congress for protection
from eavesdropping and got it. But not without being required to be
subject to fines for excessive 'dropped calls' and the demand the
providers move to more 'secure' digital transmissions as quickly as
possible, which they were doing anyway for technical reasons.
Twitter is under no obligation whatsoever to provide the service, and if
Twitter simply disappeared tomorrow, tough darts. It can discriminate.
It IS private.... Popularity doesn't change that.
Ben: Right. You can't force twitter to become a common carrier.

The definition of "Libertarian, and how it plays out in real life are
two VERY different things. Just like the definition of Marxism varies
dramatically from what, lets say, Doug Henwood, Marxist investment
advior to American Lefties and a cruise missile marxist who never met a
US invasion he didn't (initially) support, believes.
I'll stick with empirically observed generalizations when discussing
politics, thanks.
In MY experience, EVERY SINGLE LIBERTARIAN I've ever met (a few decades
ago I got to interview the Libertarian presidential candidate for a
local college paper too) turns out to be an ostensibly socially
permissive republican with the full set of American exceptionalist
traits I despise regarding everyone else om the planet.
Further, Fascists lead you to believe people have rights until your
rights interfere with their sociopolitical needs. That's a US
Libertarian, defined. Libertarian techies are also well known for being
gentrifiers of communities belonging to others... Usually POC, So
they're Fascists. and racist even if you ignore the fact that Uber
drivers OBVIOUSLY don't care to be a 'sharing economy' version of an NYC
Gypsy Cab. OFC you can't tell by looking at their hipster exterior.
They're crypto-fascist and crypto-racist with a helluva set of
rationalization and denial mechanisms.
Ps. The underlying philosophy that drives US libertarians (using
schmucks like Ron Paul as example) dissuades me from believing in such
an animal as an anarcho-libertarian, or even one that actually believes
in democratic systems... Unless it's MOB democracy of course. Ie How
Hipster gentrification 'does it's thing' with utter disregard to the
people they're driving away from their new nest.

"socially-permissive republican" is not the mainstream of the Republican
party, economically-permissive democrat IS in the mainstream in that
party if you consider the regulations made DEFINITELY work in favor of
capitalists (employers, financial industry) and not the workers. The
capitalists say that's not true. Regulation hurts them. But "Hurts them"
means it prevents them from having it all.
Ps. You're discussing this with someone who thinks the two parties are
really two right wing factions of a one party state with the belief in
'manifest destiny' and 'nationalist exceptionalism' (fascism you know?)
as ideology.

Libertarians are fine with underpaid labor in the fields because it's
the natural order of things that bright minds with bright ideas, like

To one person a 'raise in 'standard of living' means the power doesn't
go out every time there's a storm(rural or suburban), or a new park in
the neighborhood(urban), to  another it's a 1/2 million dollar ticky
tacky condo close to work in a town they don't even live at. Put
succinctly, they don't want to live in your neighborhood. They want to
live in THEIR neighborhood where you USED TO LIVE, and the truly
disgusting part is they have absolutely no concern whatsoever where you

No. I justify it on the fact that they're the criminals and taxes
appropriately applied are really a form of restitution. If they don't
like it they can hire an army. They can afford it. After all that's how
they robbed the rest of us in the first place.
Thing is taxes aren't appropriately applied. That 50% tax on the wealthy
you speak of doesn't really exist after deductions and writedowns nd
donations of high-heeled shoes to the Haiti relief fund. Right? Some
wealthy people pay less taxes than that guy living in a box in a field.
Actually most wealthy people pay almost nothing percentage-wise after
all the bennies their plutocrat friends write into tax codes compared to
their UNEARNED (as in they didn't actually work or produce anything
useful to society) income.
And then there's sales tax, which rips workers off way out of proportion
to the wealthy.
It's not the tax. It's how it's collected, and certainly how it's
disbursed (almost all of it to the war machine owned or invested in by
the wealthy.)

The scale of the violence is indicative of the company's desperation.
It's been reported in the MSM that the pipeline, even in best
circumstances is going to be a money-loser for investors, Standing Rock
was trending on Facebook yesterday with A MILLION PEOPLE posting on the
topic, and the contract terms call for completion of the Standing Rock
portion of the tarpipe by the end of this year.
About the water cannons... Let's clarify something here... Federal law
requires municipal governments, State governments, and agencies that
serve elderly, homeless and other at-risk-of-exposure citizens to do
everything possible to protect them. You can see that warning on the
National Weather Service Forecasters discussion page for any area of the
US under freeze warning. Spraying people with water... even using a
garden hose, in freezing weather, is a violation of federal and state
laws everywhere in the US.
I'm seeing a certain idiocy in the Stand Rock defender's approach in
that they seem to be relying entirely on bad pr for the company for
their pr. That WILL NOT stop the company from completing the tarpipe. I
even had some idiot on twitter, who speaks as if hes a standing rock
elder but isn't claim that the takedown of one of the munitions
suppliers sites by anon was somehow against the wishes of the SR elders.
The word "Annihilation" gets uses a lot when any other tactic than using

(Please bear with me. I have tried to condense all the researched

History can be a very useful tool. The need to always research the
truth, and understand its relevance is the key to defeating fascism
wherever its ugly head pops up. The true revolution is the evolution of
consciousness. If you rely on the mainstream media or utterances of
"elected" U.S. government officials, you will never truly 'see', or
understand, what is happening all around you, nor will you ever break
free of the chains of mental, as well as economic and physical slavery.
Cuba was one of the last colonial possessions under Spanish rule just 90
miles south of Florida. As Spain’s Imperial power was in decline,
Washington had imperial ambitions to expand its influence on Cuba. Cuba
had the potential to produce unlimited profits for U.S. business
interests. Even organized crime got into the picture when they became a
major player in Cuba in the early 1930’s. The Mafia managed to expand
their gaming industry, prostitution and drug trade operations to Cuba to
avoid harassment from the U.S. government [Citation: "Havana Nocturne:
How the Mob Owned Cuba and then Lost it to the Revolution", an excellent
expose of how the mafia operated in Cuba, by T.J. English]. Cuba was to
be their base of operations as they were looking to expand into other
Caribbean nations. During that time, Cuba was under the leadership of
President Fulgencio Batista, a good friend to organized crime, who had
close political ties to Washington and its multinational corporations.
Cuba became a cesspool of corruption, illegal drugs and prostitution
which became a playground for the rich and famous while the majority of
ordinary Cubans lived in extreme poverty. This is an historical account
of Cuba before 1959, a time period that explains why Cuba’s Revolution
was a long time in the making.
We all know the story of how Cuban leader Fidel Castro established the
first communist state in the Western Hemisphere, leading an overthrow of
the corrupt military dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista in 1959, ruling
over Cuba for nearly five decades, and irking the great American
superpower after nationalizing U.S.-owned businesses in Cuba without
compensation since 1960.
What you don't know is what led to it.
The U.S. has been intervening in Latin America since President James
Monroe established the Monroe Doctrine, a foreign policy that prevented
European powers from colonizing any sovereign nation in “their
backyard”. Unable to convert Spanish-controlled Cuba into a slave
plantation to serve the interests of the U.S. against the Confederacy in
1860, the U.S. Congress eventually passed the ‘Teller Amendment’ in 1898
which did guarantee Cuba’s independence but was replaced in 1901 by the
‘Platt Amendment’ which gave Washington the power to intervene in Cuba
if their interests were threatened. By 1908, Cubans who fought against
Spain created a new independent political party but were oppressed and
eventually massacred by the U.S. backed Cuban government.
The Partido Independiente de Color (PIC) was composed of former African
slaves and war veterans of the1896 Cuban War of Independence. The PIC
won enough votes that undermined the ruling liberal party under
President José Miguel Gómez. President Gomez ordered the party to
disband under Cuban law which outlawed any political party based on race
although the law favored white Cubans. The PIC staged a revolt under
General Evaristo Estanoz. However, General Jose de Jesus Monteagudo
suspended constitutional rights and ordered an attack against
Afro-Cubans. The U.S. intervened and sent troops to back President Gomez
and protect its vital business interests. More than 5,000 Afro-Cubans
were massacred by lynch mobs because of their skin color. All
Afro-Cubans were under suspicion by the Gomez regime. Several
successions of Presidents eventually led to Batista whose first term was
benign. His second term was a different story though. Batista created an
anti-Communist secret police to silence the public with violence,
torture and public executions. It is estimated that there were between
10,000 to 20,000 people murdered under the Batista regime with financial
and military support from the Washington.
During Batista’s reign of terror, the "July 26 Movement" organized by
Fidel Castro and other anti-government groups throughout Cuba were
forming a rebellion against the Batista government. Arthur M.
Schlesinger Jr. who was a writer, historian, speechwriter and a Special
Assistant to President John F. Kennedy who worked primarily on Latin
American issues analyzed Batista’s Cuba on the president’s request and said:
Batista was concerned about Castro so he ordered his secret police to
torture and murder people in public to install fear in the population in
case they were considering joining the growing revolution. Batista’s
actions only angered the Cuban people and increased support for the July
26 Movement. Many organizations joined the movement from all types of
backgrounds from the middle class including lawyers, doctors,
accountants and many others united with the poor (who were already
fighting against government forces).
An attack on the Moncada Barracks in Santiago led by Fidel Castro was
defeated by Batista’s armed forces on July 26, 1953, but with the
handwriting on the wall, on December 11, 1958, U.S. Ambassador Earl
Smith told Batista that the United States could no longer support his
government. The U.S. denied Batista asylum and suggested that he go to
Spain. On New Year’s Eve party, Batista told his government officials
that he was leaving Cuba and flew to the Dominican Republic with between
$300 and $700 million according to various estimates. Portugal’s António
Salazar, a dictator allowed Batista to enter his country. By 1972,
Batista settled in Marbella, Spain where he eventually died of a heart
Setting aside the two-faced hilarious irony for a minute, whenever you
hear leaders of the United States describe another world leader as a
"ruthless brutal dictator", invariably it brings to mind several
distinct suppositions. The basic one is that this leader must be someone
who successfully resisted attempts by the U.S. to infiltrate, pillage
and exploit that country's mineral resources. It is the height of
hypocrisy for any American politician, given the brutal history of the
United States, as well as its present ruthless racist practices, to
condemn, or see fit to criticize, the internal policies of another
nation. The secondary one is that the 'offending party' must be one who
defied the U.S. to an exasperating point of submission. Without the
efforts of Fidel Castro, South African Apartheid, as we knew it, would
never have ended. Don't buy into the American false narratives that
"protests" by liberals in the U.S. was instrumental in the fall of
Apartheid. If protesting and marching ever produced significant results,
racism would have been a thing of the past a long time ago. Hell, we've
been marching for hundreds of years.......still marching.
"638 Ways to Kill Castro" is a Channel 4 documentary film, broadcast in
the United Kingdom on November 28, 2006, which tells the story of some
of the numerous attempts by the C.I.A. to kill Cuban leader Fidel
Castro. Fabian Escalante, the former Head of the Intelligence
Directorate, and the man who had the job of protecting Castro for many
of the 49 years he was in power, alleges that there were over 600 plots
and conspiracies known to Cuban agents, all dreamt up to end Castro's
life. Some were perpetrated directly by the C.I.A., especially during
the first half of the 1960s, and others, from the seventies onwards,
made by Cuban exiles who had been trained by the C.I.A. shortly after
Castro took power in 1959.
Directed by Dollan Cannell and produced executively by Peter Moore, the
film, whose subtext is a commentary on the contemporary "War on Terror",
also contains extensive material shot with Antonio Veciana, the Cuban
exile who came close to killing Castro on three occasions over 17 years
(and now runs a 'marine supplies store' in Miami). All these men, the
film reveals, were supported and funded by the U.S. government. At one
point the C.I.A. even sought the help of the Mafia in the hope they
would be able to succeed where so many others had failed. Other
characters in the documentary are Cuban exile Félix Rodríguez, the
C.I.A. operative who trained Cuban exiles for the Bay of Pigs invasion,
and who was present when the Bolivian Army killed Che Guevara in 1967 at
the request of the Bolivian President at the time, and Enrique Ovares,
possibly the first man to make an attempt on Castro's life after he took
power. Robert Maheu is also interviewed, the Hughes associate who served
as liaison between the C.I.A. and mobsters "Johnny" Roselli and Sam
"Momo" Giancana, in another plot to kill Castro, this time using poison
In 2006, the documentary was the center of a controversy surrounding
U.S. Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen. In it the Miami Republican, who
had been recently tapped to become the top Republican on the House
International Relations Committee, states "I welcome the opportunity of
having anyone assassinate Fidel Castro and any leader who is oppressing
the people." A clip of her statement made its way to YouTube where the
newsmedia quickly picked up the story. There was a subsequent public
questioning of Ros-Lehtinen's morals and suitability for her job. She
responded by asserting that the clip was spliced together and that it
was taken out of context, but after her account was contested by the
film's director, she eventually released a statement, on Christmas Eve,
accepting that she had made the remark.
It is mind-boggling that America, a country which brutally murdered
upwards of 100 million Native-Americans, stole their land, raped their
womenfolk and children, and all but ethnically-cleansed them from the
face of the earth....a nation which gleefully engaged in a repressive
African Slave trade Holocaust which saw the violent deaths of up to 50
million Africans, and led to the forced labor, and Jim Crow laws that
resulted in the emergence of America as a 16th century global power
through the tobacco and cotton international trade, and continues to
marginalize, exploit, murder people of African descent, and exploit
African mineral resources, till today....a Republic that dropped the
first, and only nuclear weapons on Japan, killing up to a quarter of a
million people within days, and almost that much in the resulting
radiation fallout which lasted years.....a nation that dropped 280
million cluster bombs on Laos, a country with which it wasn't even at
war, a country that has invaded or bombed over 90 countries, would have
the arrogant temerity and sagging cojones to dissect the policies of
another sovereign nation.
Until the fall of the Portuguese dictatorship in 1974, apartheid in
South Africa was secure. There was no substantial resistance anywhere in
southern Africa. Pretoria’s neighbors comprised of buffer zones that
protected the racist regime: Namibia, their immediate neighbor which
they had occupied for 60 years; white-ruled Rhodesia; and the
Portuguese-ruled colonies of Angola and Mozambique. The rebels who
fought against minority rule in each of these countries, operating
without any safe haven to organize and train, were powerless to
challenge the status quo.
South Africa’s apartheid buffer, supported by the United States of
America for economic purposes, would have remained intact for the
foreseeable future, solidifying apartheid and preventing any significant
opposition, but for one man: Fidel Castro.
In October of 1975, South Africa invaded Angola at the behest of the
U.S. government to overthrow the left-wing Popular Movement for the
Liberation of Angola (MPLA) in the soon-to-be independent country.
Without Cuban assistance, the apartheid army would have easily cruised
into Luanda, crushed the MPLA, and installed a puppet government
friendly to the apartheid regime. Afraid of having a government
staunchly opposed to white domination so close to home, South Africa
rushed to prevent self-determination for the Angolans. They were aided
by U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who believed the threat of
black liberation in Africa, which would lead to local control of their
own resources at the expense of foreign investors, could still be contained.
Bear in mind that at the same time the C.I.A. were engaged in another
brutal massacre in South America, intended to eradicate communist or
Soviet influence and ideas, and suppress active or potential opposition
known as "Operation Condor", a campaign of political repression and
state terror involving intelligence operations and assassinations of up
to 70,000 opponents, which started in 1968, but "officially" implemented
in 1975, by the right-wing dictatorships of South American countries. To
understand how an individual, group, entity or State, operates, you have
to think in parallel terms. It will better illustrate the patterns of
action that individual/entity/State operates under. In addition, the
rest of the world was still aghast and in shock over the American
annihilation of almost half a million Japanese civilians. Operation
Condor's key members were the governments in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay,
Paraguay, Bolivia and Brazil. The U.S. government provided technical
support and supplied military aid to the participants until at least
1978, and again after Republican Ronald Reagan became President in 1981.
Such support was frequently routed through the Central Intelligence Agency.
South Africa launched an invasion to topple the MPLA and install the
guerilla Jonas Savimbi, leader of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), the smallest and least popular of the
three groups, as a puppet dictator in Angola. Savimbi, a collaborator
with the Portuguese dictatorship before Angolan independence, was known
for his ruthlessness, terrorism, and hunger for power. An avowed
anti-communist who had already aligned with South Africa, Savimbi would
have made the perfect Angolan facade for apartheid control, and
undoubtedly, had he prevailed, would have been touted by the U.S. as " a
Agostinho Neto, the President of Angola, and distinguished poet who has
led the MPLA since 1962, appealed to Cuba to send troops to ward off the
apartheid army’s invasion. On November 4, 1975, Castro agreed. Several
days later the first Cuban special forces troops boarded planes for
Angola, where they would launch "Operation Carlota".
Research the Battles of Quifangondo and Ebo to fully understand the
impact of the Cuban victory, and how its effects resonated far beyond
the battlefield. More important than the strategic gain, the victory of
black Cuban and Angolan troops against the whites South African racist
army shattered the illusion of white invincibility.
A South African military analyst described the meaning of his country’s
defeat: “The reality is that they have won, are winning, and are not
White; and that psychological edge, that advantage the White man has
enjoyed and exploited over 300 years of colonialism and empire, is
slipping away. White elitism has suffered an irreversible blow in
Angola, and Whites who have been there know it.” [cited by Piero Gleijeses]
Cuba’s 30,000-man strong military intervention in Angola managed to
change the course of that country and reverberate throughout Africa. By
ensuring independence from the white supremacists, Angola was able to
preserve its own revolution and maintain its role as a base for armed
resistance groups fighting for liberation in nearby countries.
The Americans were furious. “Kissinger’s response to Castro’s
intervention was to throw mercenaries and weapons at the problem,”
Gleijeses writes. [Citation: Gleijeses, Piero. Conflicting Missions:
Havana, Washington, and Africa, 1959-1976 (Envisioning Cuba). The
University of North Carolina Press, 2002].
The U.S. Secretary of State was afraid that after their successful
intervention in Angola, Cuba would put the rest of the racist regimes in
the region in jeopardy:
“We can’t say Rhodesia is not a danger because it is a bad case. If the
Cubans are involved there, Namibia is next and after that South Africa,
itself … If the Cubans move, I recommend we act vigorously. We can’t
permit another move without suffering a great loss.” [Citation:
“National Security Council Meeting, 4/7/1976” of the National Security
Adviser’s NSC Meeting File at the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Library.
(pg. 21) Sore losers that they were, after losing the war, in 1978, the South
African SADF massacred 600 unarmed Namibians at a refugee camp in
Cassinga, but the U.S. opposed any sanctions against them in the UN
Security Council as the apartheid government kept up its relentless
fight for survival. Throughout the 1980's Angola was subjected to
various incursions and invasions by South Africa confrontations which
climaxed in the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale in late 1987. With the
military confrontation raging, talks started between Angola, Cuba and
South Africa, with the United States moderating, in London in early
1988. In instructions to the Cuban delegation, Castro reflected on the
South Africans and American mindset.
“The fact they have accepted this meeting in London at such a high level
shows that they are looking for a way out because they have seen our
advance and are saying, ‘How is it that Cuba has converted itself into
the liquidator of Apartheid and the liberator of Africa?’ That’s what is
worrying the Americans, they’re going to say: ‘They’re going to defeat
South Africa!” Castro said. [Citation: Instructions to the Cuban
Delegation for the London Meeting, ‘Indicaciones concretas del
Comandante en Jefe que guiarán la actuación de la delegación cubana a
las conversaciones de Luanda y las negociaciones de Londres (April 22,
Castro also told his delegation that the goal was not to pursue a war or
military victory, but to achieve negotiations over SADF withdrawal from
Angola and implementation of Resolution 435, which would grant
independence to Namibia. “They should know that we are not playing
games, that our position is serious and that our objective is peace,” he
said. President Reagan administration's efforts to seek modification of
United Nations resolution 435 on Namibia to allow South African a say,
received a serious rebuff from Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau
and Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, until eager to keep doing
business with the mineral resource-rich Angola, and surreptitiously keep
funding other brigands in nearby Congo, the U.S. succumbed.
In the American version of Cold War history, Cuba was carrying out
aggression and acting as proxies of the Soviet Union. Were it not for
one persistent and meticulous scholar, we might never have known that
these are nothing more than dishonest fabrications. In his monumental
books “Conflicting Missions” and “Visions of Freedom,” historian Piero
Gleijeses uses thousands of documents from Cuban military archives, as
well as U.S. and South African archives, to recount a dramatic,
historical confrontation between tiny Cuba and Washington and its ally
apartheid South Africa. Gleijeses is the only foreign scholar to have
gained access to the closed Cuban archives. He obtained thousands of
pages of documents, and made them available to the Wilson Center Digital
Archive, which has posted the invaluable collection online.
Gleijeses’s research made possible a look behind the curtain at one of
the most remarkable acts of "internationalism" of the century.
“Internationalism, (or the duty to help others), was at the core of the
Cuban revolution,” Gleijeses writes. “For Castro’s followers, and they
were legion, this was not rhetoric. By 1975, approximately 1,000 Cuban
aid workers had gone to a dozen African countries, South Yemen, and
North Vietnam. In 1976-77, technical assistance was extended to Jamaica
and Guyana in the Western Hemisphere; to Angola, Mozambique, and
Ethiopia in Africa; and to Laos in Asia....all places that had suffered
bombings and illegal incursions at the hands of the U.S.
Even the C.I.A. noted: "The Cuban technicians are primarily involved in
rural development and educational and public health projects... areas in
which Cuba has accumulated expertise and has experienced success at
home." [Gleijeses, Piero. Visions of Freedom: Havana, Washington,
Pretoria, and the Struggle for Southern Africa, 1976-1991. The
University of North Carolina Press, 2013].
The fight against apartheid, for the liberation of people who suffered
for centuries under colonialism and racial subjugation, was truly a
David versus Goliath conflict. In addition to having a strong military
itself and being armed with Israeli-supplied nuclear weapons, South
Africa enjoyed the diplomatic support of the United States, the world’s
largest superpower. Of course, this was because the main industries
propping up the evil Apartheid regime were American corporations. Within
this context, Cuba’s intervention....a poor Caribbean island under
relentless attack from a racist juggernaut backed by the world’s leading
imperial power, is even more remarkable.
Explaining how the significance of Cuba’s role in Angola is “without
 “No other Third World country has
projected its military power beyond its immediate neighborhood. The
engine was Cuba. It was the Cubans who pushed the Soviets to help
Angola. It was they who stood guard in Angola for many long years,
thousands of miles from home, to prevent the South Africans from
overthrowing the MPLA government.” He notes that while the Soviet Union
later sent aid and weapons, they never would have become involved unless
Castro had taken the lead (which he did in spite of Russian opposition):
In Castro's Cuba, $1 could buy half a pint of milk, a month's childcare
for one toddler and a box at the opera to see the visiting Bolshoi
Ballet, and with one of the best healthcare systems in the world, cures
for certain forms of cancer (which currently cost about one dollar in
Cuba), Cuba's defiance, spanning the span of 11 U.S. presidencies,
finally brought America to its knees as President Obama recently
restored diplomatic relations with its hated enemy, after over half a
century of enduring tactics the Gestapo would have been proud of. As
usual, salivating over anticipated profits for Big-Pharma, what passes
for American morality has been superseded by prevalent greed. It didn't
assuage the much-vaunted American arrogance, either, that Russians had
already signed a deal to drill for oil off the Cuban coast where Havana
says there may be 20 billion barrels of oil, although the U.S. estimates
there are only five billion barrels.
So in conclusion, do these actions seem to you, the actions of a "brutal
dictator" who cares nothing for the well-being of people? Whenever you
read, or hear that Castro, or anyone else for that matter, was "a menace
and brutal dictator", do your own research. People all around the world
are lamenting the passing of this bearded revolutionary hero, who
survived a crippling U.S. trade embargo as well as hundreds, of
assassination plots for half a century. Castro overcame imprisonment at
the hands of dictator Fulgencio Batista, exile in Mexico and a
disastrous start to his rebellion before triumphantly riding into Havana
in January 1959 to become, at age 32, the youngest leader in Latin
America. For decades, he served as an inspiration and source of support
to revolutionaries spanning Latin America to Africa. There is not a dry
eye in Cuba, and many parts of the world today, and a 9-day period of
mourning has been declared in Havana. The only ones rejoicing....well,
you know it, the Americans, Cuban exile descendants of the Batista-era
elite, and lapdog governments of France and Britain...as well as those
who, either have something to gain from this news, or lacking historical
context, just don't know any better.
My footnote to the sordid tale of the Portugues-South African-American
pillaging of Angola is that 40 years later, Portugal is broke...and
Angola, crude oil-rich, graciously came to the rescue of their former
brutal colonial oppressor, paying off their foreign debts. That is the
true African spirit. America should borrow a page from the book of
African humanity before it's too late....but in true 'Murices fashion,
are busy draining Namibia of its uranium, Congo of its Coltan, and
Botswana of its diamonds.
Let it be known......Castro was a true hero.

Muni passengers were treated to free rides for much of the weekend after
a cyber attack on Muni's computer network Friday afternoon left
ticketing kiosks inoperable. But the San Francisco Municipal Transit
Agency looks poised to lose more than a weekend of fares, Hoodline has
According to the pseudonymous hacker, the agency's computers are being
held ransom for more than $73,000 dollars with only one day left to
pay—and nearly 25 percent of Muni's network has been compromised.
The severity of the attack still remains unknown to the public. However,
documents released by one of the hackers suggest many vital agency
functions have been compromised, including payroll, email servers,
Quickbooks, NextBus operations, various MySQL database servers, staff
training and personal computers for hundreds of employees.
In all, the hackers claim to control 2,112 of SFMTA's 8,656 computer
In a statement released by agency spokesperson Paul Rose, “The incident
remains under investigation, so it wouldn't be appropriate to provide
any additional details at this point.”
The attack, first reported by the Examiner on Saturday (link), left
kiosks across Muni's downtown stations with a message reading, “You
Hacked, ALL Data Encrypted. Contact For Key(cryptom27 at yandex.com)ID:681
Unable to process fares, Muni left turnstiles open for passengers to
ride freely.Muni's computers have been hijacked using the HDDCryptor
ransomware, which targets Windows machines. Also known as Mamba, the
ransomware encrypts hard drives and requires a password to unlock,
leaving Muni without access.
Reached at the provided email, the hackers, calling themselves “Andy
Saolis,” demanded 100 Bitcoin—the equivalent of more than $73,000—from
San Francisco's transit agency:
if You are Responsible in MUNI-RAILWAY !
All Your Computer’s/Server's in MUNI-RAILWAY Domain Encrypted By AES
We have 2000 Decryption Key !
Send 100BTC to My Bitcoin Wallet , then We Send you Decryption key For
Your All Server's HDD!!
We Only Accept Bitcoin , it’s So easy!
you can use Brokers to exchange your money to BTC ASAP
it's Fast way!
The hackers followed up, writing, “say to company owner we are waiting
one more day for deal and after it this email closing for security
reason!” In another email, they declared, “we only encrypt 2000
important server and PC , another systems don't point to us !”
Andy Saolis—a pseudonym commonly used in HDDCryptor ransom attacks—also
provided a list of all 2,112 machines under their control, as well as a
Bitcoin wallet to which the ransom could be paid. So far, no transfer
have been posted to that wallet, but it is likely the hackers provided
different wallets to each email contact to avoid being easily tracked.
SFMTA's backup servers did not appear to be among the thousands of
impacted machines, which could allow the agency to avoid paying the
ransom and restore their computers from previous copies of their system
data. However, depending on how old the backups are, they still could
risk losing critical information.

The Military-Civil Society Suppression Interface - “The Other Side Of
The Coin: Counterinsurgency And Community Policing”
Kirsten Williams
This essay outlines the current counterinsurgency model, with an
emphasis on its domestic application in the United States. It shows that
many contemporary counterinsurgency practices were developed by police
agencies inside the U.S., and illustrates the transfer of theory,
strategy, and technique from domestic police to the military - and back.
The essay also examines the state’s use of nongovernmental or nonprofit
agencies, as one element of counterinsurgency strategy, to channel and
control political opposition. [emphasis mine -RR] The conclusion briefly
considers the strategic implications for social movements, especially as
we learn to recognize and respond to political repression.
Introduction: Expect Repression
The goal is to create enough fear and anger to cause the leaders to

By Tim Johnson [email redacted]
Civil and human rights groups issued denunciations and some
cybersecurity experts urged their clients to stop using the popular
Yahoo Mail service after a news agency reported Tuesday that the
internet service provider had secretly scanned hundreds of millions of
clients’ emails at the behest of U.S. intelligence agencies.
The report by the Reuters news service said Yahoo complied with a
classified U.S. government directive last year that demanded that it
scan all incoming emails of its users for certain phrases. The report
said Yahoo’s engineers wrote a program that complied with the blanket
spying request.
“Enough is enough. It’s time to close your Yahoo account,” Graham
Cluley, a British cybersecurity expert, tweeted following the report.
The report was the second piece of challenging news in recent days for
the Sunnyvale, California, company as it attempts to finalize a $4.8
billion sale of its core business to Verizon. On Sept. 22, Yahoo
acknowledged that the passwords of 500 million Yahoo account holders had
been stolen.
Yahoo did not immediately respond to the Reuters report. A chief rival
for global email, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, said it had not been
approached by the intelligence agencies.
“We’ve never received such a request, but if we did, our response would
be simple: ‘No way,’ ” Aaron Stein, a Google spokesman, said in a
statement posted online.
Another large tech firm, Twitter, also weighed in, but without
clarifying whether it had received a directive aimed at intercepting
“Federal law prohibits us from answering your question, and we’re
currently suing the Justice Department for the ability to disclose more
information about government requests,” Twitter spokesman Nu Wexler said
in a statement.
Civil and human rights groups directed their criticism not at Yahoo but
at the U.S. government, saying its request had undermined trust in the
“The government appears to have compelled Yahoo to conduct precisely the
type of general, suspicionless search that the Fourth Amendment was
intended to prohibit,” said Patrick Toomey, an attorney for the American
Civil Liberties Union. “It is deeply disappointing that Yahoo declined
to challenge this sweeping surveillance order, because customers are
counting on technology companies to stand up to novel spying demands in
The alleged Yahoo collaboration with intelligence agencies caused
turmoil in the upper ranks of the company, the Reuters report said, and
led to the June 2015 departure of Chief Information Security Officer
Alex Stamos.
Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer bypassed the company’s security team
and went to engineers to write the program to siphon off emails in real
time for the government, it added.
Stamos, who is now the chief security officer for Facebook, offered no
immediate comment on the report. The federal government also did not
Amnesty International, a London-based rights group, lamented what it
called the eroding privacy of internet users and efforts by the U.S.
government to “indiscriminately vacuum up the world’s data.”
“This is a clear sign that people can trust neither their government nor
their service providers to respect their privacy: Only end-to-end
encryption that keeps their communications away from prying eyes will
do,” said Amnesty’s Sherif Elsayed-Ali, the head of technology and human
Yahoo has gotten into hot water before for collaborating with government
requests – in China. More than a decade ago, it shared information with
the Chinese government that allowed for the jailing of two dissidents,
one of whom, Wang Xiaoning, spent a decade in jail. The other dissident,
Shi Tao, served a shorter sentence.
Yahoo’s partial sale to Verizon is already facing uncertainty over the
massive data breach, which took place in 2014. Yahoo apparently did not
inform Verizon of the breach, and news of it came out only last month
when Yahoo user data was offered for sale on the black market.
Legal advocates said they expected Congress to be uneasy over Tuesday’s
“If Yahoo is indeed scanning the content of all of its customers’ emails
at the NSA’s behest, that would appear to violate the Fourth Amendment,”
said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York
University School of Law.
“It’s also a violation of customers’ privacy and trust. It’s disturbing
to learn that the NSA was secretly expanding its surveillance reach at
the very same time Congress was attempting to rein it in,” added
Goitein, who is co-director of the center’s Liberty and National
Security Program.
Privacy has been a major issue in Washington since former NSA and CIA
contractor Edward Snowden leaked top-secret information about National
Security Agency monitoring of Americans’ email and cellphone use in
2013. Congress ended one formerly secret program after the revelations.
The issue of privacy also pitted the FBI against the tech giant Apple
after the FBI sought to force Apple to circumvent security settings on a
phone that had been used by one of the killers at a holiday party last
year in San Bernardino, California. Apple refused a judge’s order that
it do so. The impasse was resolved when the FBI allowed a company that
said it had developed a way to bypass the security settings to hack into
the phone.
Not surprisingly, Snowden, who now lives in Russia, was among those
urging Yahoo Mail clients to abandon the service. “Use  They
secretly scanned everything you ever wrote, far beyond what law
requires. Close your account today,” Snowden tweeted.
“Any major email service not clearly, categorically denying this
tomorrow – without careful phrasing – is as guilty as Yahoo,” Snowden
said in another tweet.

contributor and was just saving snippets for other projects, which would
still undoubtedly be illegal). Some of the code is apparently the kind
that make it look like others are attacking a system, like Erections
2016 cyberops... botnets.
He was ARRESTED IN SECRET OVER A MONTH AGO.
They say he was being grilled to figure out his 'psychological
motivations'... but perhaps they found their perfect opportunity to
blame the election hacking on Russia and they didn't want some pissant
contractor blowing their cyber and PR operation if the public found out
that code was 'in the wild' and anyone could have been doing it.

You know what they say about the market. When everyone is getting in,
it's time to bail...
WASHINGTON - Want a career with zero chances of going jobless?
Try the booming field of cybersecurity. Companies can’t hire fast
enough. In the United States, companies report 209,000 cybersecurity
jobs that are in need of filling.
It’ll only get worse. By 2019, according to the Cybersecurity Jobs
Report, the workforce shortfall may reach 1.5 million. Globally, the
shortage could hit 6 million, it added.
“The internet is growing faster than the growth of people to protect
it,” said Michael Kaiser, chief executive of the National Cyber Security
It is a problem with the full attention of the White House, which in
July called for “immediate and broad-sweeping actions to address the
growing workforce shortage and establish a pipeline of well-qualified
cybersecurity talent.”
A dramatic rise in cybercrime has put government in competition with
private companies for hiring cybersecurity experts. Private companies
recoil at the possibility of hackers stealing their proprietary
information, holding their data for ransom or plundering their servers
of the personal information of clients.
The shortage in job candidates is not an easy or quick problem to
address, experts said.
“It takes a long time to develop the instincts to be an effective
cybersecurity engineer. You can’t just come out of college and know what
to do,” said David Foote, a tech industry researcher and co-founder of
Foote Partners of Vero Beach, Florida.
“The threat landscape changes all the time, and that’s hard to train
for,” Kaiser added.
Foote said both government and private industry faced shortages: “In the
short term, it’s not looking good. There are so many employers who are
way behind in staffing.”
Efforts to poach cybersecurity experts occur at a blistering pace.
Some 46 percent of working cybersecurity professionals said they
received solicitations for other jobs “at least once per week,”
according to the State of Cyber Security Professional Careers, a survey
released last month jointly by the Enterprise Strategy Group and
Information Systems Security Association.
“Turnover in the cybersecurity ranks could represent an existential risk
to organizations in lower-paying industries like academia, health care,
the public sector and retail,” the survey said.
In the federal government’s push to expand cybersecurity training, it
has targeted all levels of education, including $125 million in National
Science Foundation grants to primary and secondary schools. It has also
designated nearly 200 colleges and universities as National Centers of
Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense.
Many universities are gearing up programs to meet the surge in demand.
“We will start teaching the first group of students in two weeks,” said
Alan M. Usas, the director of the new executive master’s in
cybersecurity program at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.
“Interest has been extremely high.”
But luring younger students into cybersecurity can be a tough sell.
“People who are graduating from college are looking for the next killer
app or to create the next startup,” said Katrina Timlin, an associate
fellow in the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
Cybersecurity has little of the cachet of other areas of information
technology, such as machine learning, and cybersecurity experts aren’t
even always loved at their own companies. Their departments are not
revenue generators. And their constant efforts to penetrate systems can
raise hackles.
“They have to have that nonconformist edge where they can pick apart a
problem. That kind of personality pushes some people’s buttons,” Timlin
As they look for flaws in existing networks and systems, cybersecurity
experts can find themselves at loggerheads with technology engineers who
built the systems, she said.
Cybersecurity encompasses far more than just technology issues.
“Most every company that has an internet presence by definition is a
global company,” Usas said. When hacks occur, “there’s forensic work
that needs to be done,” he added, but often legal and policy issues come
into play, as well as human behavior analysis.
“There are a number of straight deep tech jobs, but there are also a
number of hybrid jobs,” Foote said, noting that computer hacks can
affect accounting and finance divisions, as well as logistics, marketing
and legal affairs.
Those who are already established in cybersecurity and leading teams at
companies are well-compensated.
“There is some talk out there, I’ve heard it, that lead software
security engineers are making $230,000 and $240,000 a year. It’s crazy,”
said Foote.
Foote’s consulting firm receives compensation data from 2,914 employers
who report on what they pay 255,650 full-time technology professionals.
In the most recent quarter, Foote said, the firm found an average salary
of $99,000 for a cyber security specialist with three years’ experience
in design, deployment and administration of security systems. For a more
senior employee with at least five years of experience and strong
knowledge of digital controls and protection strategies, the national
average salary is $118,000.
Cybersecurity jobs in the United States pay an average of $6,500 more
than other information technology professions, a premium of 9 percent,
according to a July report, Hacking the Skills Shortage, by Intel
Security and the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

More on the delusional behavior that might be exhibited if you're
'touched in da haid' enough to  believe your own delusions about
'simulation', as translated into strategy and tactics.
"The Chalabi Card".
Juan Cole, professor of Persian studies, recounts a convo between
AIPAC's BFF Doug Feith, who was head of the "Department of Lying to the
American Public" at the Pentagon during the run-up to the War on Iraq,
with a low-level State Department employee he was teaching during his
short stint at one of the  power-elite's Peer Reviewed institutions...
Georgetown University:
"State Dept. Official: “Doug, after the smoke clears, what is the plan?”
Feith: “Think of Iraq as being like a computer. And think of Saddam as
like a processor. We just take out the old processor, and put in a new
State Dept. Official: “Put in a new processor?”
Feith: “Yes! It will all be over in 6 weeks.”
State Dept. Official: “You mean six months.”
Feith: “No, six weeks. You’ll see.”
State Dept. Official: “Doug.”
Feith: “Yes?”
State Dept. Official: “You’re smoking crack, Doug.”
Feith: “Oh, so you’re disloyal to the President, are you?”
Verification of Feith’s belief in a 'short war’ was published by the
National Security Archive and it SEEMED to be due to the apparent fact
that Chalabi and friends channeled funds to ostensibly sympathetic
people in Iraq’s government… They REALLY expected the US to just walk
in, greeted with flowers, because “Delusional”.
TOP SECRET POLO STEP
Iraq War Plan Assumed Only 5,000 U.S. Troops Still There by December 2006
“First, they assumed that a provisional government would be in place by
‘D-Day’, then that the Iraqis would stay in their garrisons and be
reliable partners, and finally that the post-hostilities phase would be
a matter of mere ‘months’. ”

Russia doesn't have any "homophobic policies". Russians know that.
That's why the Soros foundation and other western LGBT orgs (the kind
that consider Chelsea Manning not worthy of an honorary place at the SF

deaf ears and is pretty much ignored.
Not caring who loves or fucks who and thinking it shouldn't be dinner

black people, take bribes, rape women, but that's NOT legitimate
government policy. There's footage on the web of a couple of Moscow cops
with a transvestite in the car for some reason. They release her and
then crack up laughing. Take your pick. Some cops are thugs. Some think
TVs and gayfolk are unusual and funny, but most Russians simply don't
care, AND my POINT is THERE ARE NO DISCRIMINATORY LEGAL POLICIES and
haven't been since 1917.
What a couple of pigs did to your gay friends is pretty irrelevant to
laws regarding being gay in Russia. There are none. There ARE right wing
reactionaries though. They tend to be cops. In the US too.
Soros and co's LGBT 'rights' plan won't solve that. It would most likely
bring on REACTION. As in REACTIONARY.
Besises. All scum like Soros are interested in is opening up markets.
Been to any Gay Pride Parades recently? In the US it IS a hot market,
and affluent, and you an find EVERYTHING branded for Gay folk.
You want that kind of liberation? Trick question... It ISN'T liberation.
Liberation means freedom to do what you want without interference and
the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT of Russia doesn't.

You're still NOT making a case for the Russian government legislating
homophobic polices.
What X mentioned: "law banning distribution of "propaganda
of non-traditional sexual relationships" to minors." isn't.
And the rest: "Following its passage, there has been increased
discrimination against gays, and increased protests. In 2013 the USA
received over 800 asylum requests from homosexuals in Russia."
Welp! THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE FUCKING "CONVERSATION" GETS STARTED!

Also note Stalin's pronouncements regarding gays and others was just as

Interpreting Data About ISIS Online
Oct 6, 2016
Challenging ISIS has little to do with their number of followers, or the
decline in their number of messages. This type of tactical-level data
can indicate success, but genuine impact can only occur with robust
interpretation of data at the strategic level.
Recent studies have been used to claim success in reducing the number of
followers and volume of ISIS content on social media. Reports which
appear to show decline are seized on and used by many of the Public
Diplomacy and Information Operations strategies deployed against ISIS,
which seek opportunities to highlight failures and losses of the group.
Yet it is equally clear that, despite increasing efforts by western
governments and social media providers to counter ISIS online, ISIS
continues to produce and disseminate large quantities of
ideologically-inspired audio visual content and information. Equally,
individuals who have never had direct contact with the group commit acts
of violence in their name.
As such, it is often the case that the detail tells a different story
than some of the claims made about the data, specifically that ISIS is
experiencing a decline in followers and content on Twitter.<
Decline in the Number of Twitter Followers
The decline in the number of followers is frequently cited by those
seeking to emphasize success against ISIS. I’ve written previously about
the significant problems in the data collection and analysis in one of
the frequently cited studies. Even so, this study is cited as showing a
decline in follower numbers, despite actually concluding that
“suspensions held the size and reach of the overall network flat, while
devastating the reach of specific users who have been repeatedly targeted.”
Claims of success against an adversary must account for fluctuations in
said adversary’s tactics.
Social media platforms are fundamentally social networks. The metrics
about followers which Twitter produces are accurate for an individual
account, but cannot simply be aggregated to show the total number of
followers in a specific network. If number of followers is aggregated,
it will likely produce wildly inflated numbers for reach, and equally
overstate the decline in ISIS social media.
The falling follower fallacy is demonstrated in the image below. In it,
the same nodes are shown connected in different configurations, similar
to the three types or topologies John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt
highlighted in their discussion of Netwar.
Reading left to right, the different layouts demonstrate that:
    Aggregating follower numbers inflates the number of accounts that
appear to be in the network.
    The decline in aggregated follower numbers cannot be read as showing
decline in the number of accounts in the network.
    The decline in aggregated follower numbers cannot be used to show
that the network is being disrupted.
Ultimately, the Twitter strategy is to disseminate content, not gather
followers. In fact, distributing content rather than gaining followers
is the stated objective within ISIS networks, and as shown here, this is
entirely possible despite declining aggregate follower numbers..."

Russia considers opening military base in Cuba
"Hagbard Celine’s gigantic computer, FUCKUP-First Universal
Cybernetic-Kinetic-Ultramicro-Programmer- was basically a rather
sophisticated form of the standard self-programming algorithmic logic
machine of the time; the name was one of his whimsies.
FUCKUP’s real claim to uniqueness was a programmed stochastic process
whereby it could “throw” an I Ching hexagram, reading’ a random open
circuit as a broken (yin) line and a random closed circuit as a full
(yang) line until six such “lines” were round.
Consulting its memory banks, where the whole tradition of I Ching
interpretation was stored, and then cross-checking its current scannings
of that day’s political, economic, meteorological, astrological,
astronomical, and technological eccentricities, it would provide a
reading of the hexagram which, to Hagbard’s mind, combined the best of
the scientific and occult methods for spotting oncoming trends.
On March 13, the stochastic pattern spontaneously generated Hexagram 23,
“Breaking Apart.”
FUCKUP then interpreted:
        “This traditionally unlucky sign was cast by Atlantean
scientist-priests shortly before the destruction of their continent and
is generally connected with death by water. Other vibrations link it to
earthquakes, tornadoes and similar disasters, and to sickness, decay,
and morbidity as well.
        The first correlation is with the unbalance between
technological acceleration and political retrogression, which has
proceeded earth-wide at ever widening danger levels since 1914 and
especially since 1964.
        The breaking apart is fundamentally the schizoid and schismatic
mental fugue of lawyer-politicians attempting to administrate a
worldwide technology whose mechanisms they lack the education to
comprehend and whose gestalt trend they frustrate by breaking apart into
obsolete Renaissance nation-states.
        World War III is probably imminent and, considering the advances
in chemical biological warfare in conjunction with the sickness
vibrations of Hexagram 23, the unleashing of plague or nerve gas or both
is as probable as thermonuclear overkill.
        General prognosis: many megadeaths.
        There is some hope for avoidance of the emerging pattern with
prompt action of correct nature.
        Probability of such avoidance is 0.17 ± 0.05.
        No blame.”

Therefore, it was a bit remarkable that in the course of developing some
training, there was a request for me to create some fake online personas
that would hold up against moderately security savvy users. I think most
of us have created an online alter ego to some extent, but these needed
to be pretty comprehensive to stand up to some scrutiny. Just making an
email account wasn’t going to cut it.
So Pancakes went on an adventure into Backstop land. And made a lot of
amusing mistakes and learned quite a few things on the way. I’ll share
some of them here, so the social engineers can have a giggle and offer
suggestions in the comments, and the other hobbyists can learn from my
mistakes. Yes, there are automated tools that will help you do this if
you have to do it in bulk for work, but many of the problems still
exist. (Please keep in mind that misrepresenting yourself on these
services can cause your account to be suspended or banned, so if you’re

The current incarnation of projectpm he links to in the article is still

the domain changed. It was my line of questioning when I was set up for
an ambush interview on twitter with Cloudflare's CEO by Yasha Levine.
All he said was something about the people at the site oking it, but he
never stated who (didn't expect him to divulge that info) and waffled
when asked if Barrett's people had authorized it or the server's OWNER
had authorized it, then shut the convo down.
The IP is currently registered to "Incapsula" which appears to be

Sigh... Theo Roszak proposed that money and power are really just
substitutes for, or ways of obtaining, life extension. But that doesn't
mean age is considered wealth and power in Capitalist societies (though
it sure does in the few undamaged tribal societies left)
I ascribe to the idea that accumulation of wealth and political power
(which is for the most part the equivalent of social power over society
and it's individuals) for the sake of those items dynamic in controlling
the continuation of wealth and power (hence social control) in the hands
of oneself and one's friends is a pretty good place to begin, anyway.
That implies for a start, that the wealth and power aren't shared
voluntarily by that group and they conspire to keep it that way (in
private). Monarchies and dictatorships are examples. The US is
essentially a two faction soft dictatorship. 'Soft' in the sense that
the dictators, neuropsychologically preened for media 'candidates'
Americans get to select from, have the manufactured consent of of the
masses that they have the right to rule.

@_subject: =?UTF-8?Q?Search_Risk_=e2=80=93_How_Google_Almost_Killed_ProtonMail?= 
In the past two months, many of you have reached out to us to ask about
the mysterious tweets we sent to Google in August. At ProtonMail,
transparency is a core value, and we try to be as transparent with our
community as possible. As many people have continued to point out to us,
we need to be more transparent here to avoid continued confusion and
speculation. Thus, we are telling the full story today to clarify what
What Happened?
The short summary is that for nearly a year, Google was hiding
ProtonMail from search results for queries such as ‘secure email’ and
‘encrypted email’. This was highly suspicious because ProtonMail has
long been the world’s largest encrypted email provider.
When ProtonMail launched in Beta back in May 2014, our community rapidly
grew as people from around the world came together and supported us in
our mission to protect privacy in the digital age. Our record breaking
crowdfunding campaign raised over half a million dollars from
contributors and provided us with the resources to make ProtonMail
competitive against even the biggest players in the email space.
By the summer of 2015, ProtonMail passed half a million users and was
the world’s most well known secure email service. ProtonMail was also
ranking well in Google search at this time, on the first or second page
of most queries including “encrypted email” and “secure email”. However,
by the end of October 2015, the situation had changed dramatically, and
ProtonMail was mysteriously no longer showing up for searches of our two
main keywords.
Between the beginning of the summer and the fall of 2015, ProtonMail did
undergo a lot of changes. We released ProtonMail 2.0, we went fully open
source, we launched mobile apps in beta, and we updated our website,
changing our TLD from .ch to the more widely known .com. We also doubled
in size, growing to nearly 1 million users by the fall. All of these
changes should have helped ProtonMail’s search rankings as we became
more and more relevant to more people.
In November 2015, we became aware of the problem and consulted a number
of well known SEO experts. None of them could explain the issue,
especially since ProtonMail has never used any blackhat SEO tactics, nor
did we observe any used against us. Mysteriously, the issue was entirely
limited to Google, as this anomaly was not seen on any other search
engine. Below are the search rankings for ProtonMail for ‘secure email’
and ‘encrypted email’ taken at the beginning of August 2016 across all
major search engines. We rank on either page 1 or 2 everywhere except
Google where we are not ranked at all.
image: protonmail seo rankings
All throughout Spring 2016, we worked in earnest to get in touch with
Google. We created two tickets on their web spam report form explaining
the situation. We even contacted Google’s President EMEA Strategic
Relationships, but received no response nor improvement. Around this
time, we also heard about the anti-trust action brought forward by the
European Commission against Google, accusing Google of abusing its
search monopoly to lower the search rankings of Google competitors. This
was worrying news, because as an email service that puts user privacy
first, we are the leading alternative to Gmail for those looking for
better data privacy.
In August, with no other options, we turned to Twitter to press our
case. This time though, we finally got a response, thanks in large part
to the hundreds of ProtonMail users who drew attention to the issue and
made it impossible to ignore. After a few days, Google informed us that
they had “fixed something” without providing further details. The
results could be immediately seen.
image: google protonmail search risk
ProtonMail Google Search Ranking for “Encrypted Email”
In the above plots, the x-axis is time and the y-axis is search ranking
(lower number is better). The dates where there are no data points are
times when we are not ranked at all by Google. After Google made some
changes, ProtonMail’s rankings immediately recovered and are now ranked
 and  for ‘secure email’ and ‘encrypted email’ respectively. Without
any additional explanation from Google, we may never know why ProtonMail
become unranked. In any case, we do appreciate Google finally taking
action to resolve the issue, we just wished it happened sooner.
The Danger of Search Risk
This incident however highlights a previously unrecognized danger that
we are now calling Search Risk. The danger is that any service such as
ProtonMail can easily be suppressed by either search companies, or the
governments that control those search companies. This can happen even
across national borders. For example, even though Google is an American
company, it controls over 90% of European search traffic. In this case,
Google directly caused ProtonMail’s growth rate worldwide to be reduced
by over 25% for over 10 months.
This meant that ProtonMail’s income from users was also cut by 25%,
putting financial pressure on our operations. We went from being able to
cover all our monthly expenses to having to draw from our emergency
reserve fund. The lost income and financial damage incurred as a result
was several hundred thousand Swiss Francs (1 CHF = 1.01 USD), which will
never be reimbursed.
The only reason we survived to tell this story is because the majority
of ProtonMail’s growth comes from word of mouth, and our community is
too loud to be ignored. Many other companies won’t be so fortunate. This
episode illustrates that Search Risk is serious, which is why we now
agree with the European Commission that given Google’s dominant position
in search, more transparency and oversight is critical.

The Bundy Boiz acquitted of "Conspiracy to impede federal officers
through intimidation, threats or force".
Oregon militants acquitted of conspiracy in wildlife refuge seizure
By Scott Bransford
PORTLAND, Ore. A federal court jury delivered a surprise verdict on
Thursday acquitting anti-government militant leader Ammon Bundy and six
followers of conspiracy charges stemming from their role in the armed
takeover of a wildlife center in Oregon earlier this year.
The outcome marked a stinging defeat for federal prosecutors and law
enforcement in a trial the defendants sought to turn into a pulpit for
airing their opposition to U.S. government control over millions of
acres of public lands in the West.
Bundy and others, including his brother and co-defendant Ryan Bundy,
cast the 41-day occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge as a
patriotic act of civil disobedience. Prosecutors called it a lawless
scheme to seize federal property by force.
Jubilant supporters of the Bundys thronged the courthouse after the
verdict, hailing the trial's outcome as vindication of a political
ideology that is profoundly distrustful of federal authority and
challenges its legitimacy.
"We're so grateful to the jurors who weren't swayed by the nonsense that
was going on," defendant Shawna Cox told reporters. "God said we weren't
guilty. We weren't guilty of anything."
As the seven-week-long trial in the U.S. District Court in Portland
climaxed, U.S. marshals wrestled to the floor Ammon Bundy's lawyer,
Marcus Mumford, as he argued heatedly with the judge over the terms of
his client's continued detention.
The Bundys still face assault, conspiracy and other charges from a
separate armed standoff in 2014 at the Nevada ranch of their father,
Cliven Bundy, triggered when federal agents seized his cattle for his
failure to pay grazing fees for his use of public land.
The outcome of the Oregon trial clearly shocked many in the packed
courtroom. Attorneys exchanged looks of astonishment with the
defendants, then hugged their clients as the not-guilty verdicts were
read amid gasps from spectators.
Outside the courthouse, supporters celebrated by shouting "Hallelujah"
and reading passages from the U.S. Constitution. One man rode his horse,
named Lady Liberty, in front of the courthouse carrying an American flag.
The verdict came after four days of deliberations. One juror, a former
federal employee, was dismissed over questions of bias on Wednesday and
replaced by a substitute.
The 12-member panel found all seven defendants - six men and a woman -
not guilty of the most serious charge, conspiracy to impede federal
officers through intimidation, threats or force. That charge alone
carried a maximum penalty of six years in prison.
The defendants also were acquitted of illegal possession of firearms in
a federal facility and theft of government property, except in the case
of Ryan Bundy, for whom jurors were deadlocked on the charge of theft.
The takeover of the wildlife refuge was initially sparked by outrage
over the plight of two imprisoned Oregon ranchers the occupiers believed
had been unfairly treated in an arson case. But the militants said they
were also protesting larger grievances at what they saw as government
The standoff led to the shooting death of one protester, Robert "LaVoy"
Finicum, by police shortly after the Bundy brothers were arrested, and
left parts of the refuge badly damaged.
More than two dozen people, in all, have been criminally charged in the
occupation, and a second group of defendants is due to stand trial in
Mumford told reporters he believed Ammon and Ryan Bundy would remain in
custody for the time being but may be transferred to Nevada.
Four co-defendants were free on their own recognizance during the trial.
A fifth, David Fry, the last of the occupiers to surrender in February,
was released hours after the verdict.

The Military-Civil Society Suppression Interface - “The Other Side Of
The Coin: Counterinsurgency And Community Policing”
Kirsten Williams
This essay outlines the current counterinsurgency model, with an
emphasis on its domestic application in the United States. It shows that
many contemporary counterinsurgency practices were developed by police
agencies inside the U.S., and illustrates the transfer of theory,
strategy, and technique from domestic police to the military - and back.
The essay also examines the state’s use of nongovernmental or nonprofit
agencies, as one element of counterinsurgency strategy, to channel and
control political opposition. [emphasis mine -RR] The conclusion briefly
considers the strategic implications for social movements, especially as
we learn to recognize and respond to political repression.
Introduction: Expect Repression
The goal is to create enough fear and anger to cause the leaders to

and it doesn't matter anyway.
When I suggested that there might be two tors. One for them and one for
us, it elicited the 'government doesn't use it' response.
As X said, it DOES sort of tip the opponent off that you have something
to hide, but whether they can identify 'you'... especially using
something like Tails that spoofs your mac address and leaves no trace
that you've ever done anything more than power up at a given time.
So if you're in some internet cafe in Singapore with a hundred other
people walking in and out using the connection, the IP of entrance to
the tor network just doesn't do a lot to identify you unless perhaps
you're already being surveilled.
Over time, if under surveillance the opponent could find a correlation
between your presence and tor's use. Again, that why I've said 'the more
users the better'. If everyone in that Singapore cafe was using it. the
opponent would still be drawing a blank about your identity.

Civil and human rights groups issued denunciations and some
cybersecurity experts urged their clients to stop using the popular
Yahoo Mail service after a news agency reported Tuesday that the
internet service provider had secretly scanned hundreds of millions of
clients’ emails at the behest of U.S. intelligence agencies.
The report by the Reuters news service said Yahoo complied with a
classified U.S. government directive last year that demanded that it
scan all incoming emails of its users for certain phrases. The report
said Yahoo’s engineers wrote a program that complied with the blanket
spying request.
“Enough is enough. It’s time to close your Yahoo account,” Graham
Cluley, a British cybersecurity expert, tweeted following the report.
The report was the second piece of challenging news in recent days for
the Sunnyvale, California, company as it attempts to finalize a $4.8
billion sale of its core business to Verizon. On Sept. 22, Yahoo
acknowledged that the passwords of 500 million Yahoo account holders had
been stolen.
Yahoo did not immediately respond to the Reuters report. A chief rival
for global email, Alphabet Inc.’s Google, said it had not been
approached by the intelligence agencies.
“We’ve never received such a request, but if we did, our response would
be simple: ‘No way,’ ” Aaron Stein, a Google spokesman, said in a
statement posted online.
Another large tech firm, Twitter, also weighed in, but without
clarifying whether it had received a directive aimed at intercepting
“Federal law prohibits us from answering your question, and we’re
currently suing the Justice Department for the ability to disclose more
information about government requests,” Twitter spokesman Nu Wexler said
in a statement.
Civil and human rights groups directed their criticism not at Yahoo but
at the U.S. government, saying its request had undermined trust in the
“The government appears to have compelled Yahoo to conduct precisely the
type of general, suspicionless search that the Fourth Amendment was
intended to prohibit,” said Patrick Toomey, an attorney for the American
Civil Liberties Union. “It is deeply disappointing that Yahoo declined
to challenge this sweeping surveillance order, because customers are
counting on technology companies to stand up to novel spying demands in
The alleged Yahoo collaboration with intelligence agencies caused
turmoil in the upper ranks of the company, the Reuters report said, and
led to the June 2015 departure of Chief Information Security Officer
Alex Stamos.
Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer bypassed the company’s security team
and went to engineers to write the program to siphon off emails in real
time for the government, it added.
Stamos, who is now the chief security officer for Facebook, offered no
immediate comment on the report. The federal government also did not
Amnesty International, a London-based rights group, lamented what it
called the eroding privacy of internet users and efforts by the U.S.
government to “indiscriminately vacuum up the world’s data.”
“This is a clear sign that people can trust neither their government nor
their service providers to respect their privacy: Only end-to-end
encryption that keeps their communications away from prying eyes will
do,” said Amnesty’s Sherif Elsayed-Ali, the head of technology and human
Yahoo has gotten into hot water before for collaborating with government
requests – in China. More than a decade ago, it shared information with
the Chinese government that allowed for the jailing of two dissidents,
one of whom, Wang Xiaoning, spent a decade in jail. The other dissident,
Shi Tao, served a shorter sentence.
Yahoo’s partial sale to Verizon is already facing uncertainty over the
massive data breach, which took place in 2014. Yahoo apparently did not
inform Verizon of the breach, and news of it came out only last month
when Yahoo user data was offered for sale on the black market.
Legal advocates said they expected Congress to be uneasy over Tuesday’s
“If Yahoo is indeed scanning the content of all of its customers’ emails
at the NSA’s behest, that would appear to violate the Fourth Amendment,”
said Elizabeth Goitein of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York
University School of Law.
“It’s also a violation of customers’ privacy and trust. It’s disturbing
to learn that the NSA was secretly expanding its surveillance reach at
the very same time Congress was attempting to rein it in,” added
Goitein, who is co-director of the center’s Liberty and National
Security Program.
Privacy has been a major issue in Washington since former NSA and CIA
contractor Edward Snowden leaked top-secret information about National
Security Agency monitoring of Americans’ email and cellphone use in
2013. Congress ended one formerly secret program after the revelations.
The issue of privacy also pitted the FBI against the tech giant Apple
after the FBI sought to force Apple to circumvent security settings on a
phone that had been used by one of the killers at a holiday party last
year in San Bernardino, California. Apple refused a judge’s order that
it do so. The impasse was resolved when the FBI allowed a company that
said it had developed a way to bypass the security settings to hack into
the phone.
Not surprisingly, Snowden, who now lives in Russia, was among those
urging Yahoo Mail clients to abandon the service. “Use  They
secretly scanned everything you ever wrote, far beyond what law
requires. Close your account today,” Snowden tweeted.
“Any major email service not clearly, categorically denying this
tomorrow – without careful phrasing – is as guilty as Yahoo,” Snowden
said in another tweet.

I was going to bring up the concept that corporate officers (at least)
are really OWNED by the corporation that employs them and the US
government probably considers them as 'being in the US' no matter where
they go as long as they're in the employ of a corporation chartered in
the US.

If the leak came from an IP address based at the corporation's office no
matter what country it's in (assuming capitalist-friendly), I'd suspect
that a local court would give the US jurisdiction.

WASHINGTON - Want a career with zero chances of going jobless?
Try the booming field of cybersecurity. Companies can’t hire fast
enough. In the United States, companies report 209,000 cybersecurity
jobs that are in need of filling.
It’ll only get worse. By 2019, according to the Cybersecurity Jobs
Report, the workforce shortfall may reach 1.5 million. Globally, the
shortage could hit 6 million, it added.
“The internet is growing faster than the growth of people to protect
it,” said Michael Kaiser, chief executive of the National Cyber Security
It is a problem with the full attention of the White House, which in
July called for “immediate and broad-sweeping actions to address the
growing workforce shortage and establish a pipeline of well-qualified
cybersecurity talent.”
A dramatic rise in cybercrime has put government in competition with
private companies for hiring cybersecurity experts. Private companies
recoil at the possibility of hackers stealing their proprietary
information, holding their data for ransom or plundering their servers
of the personal information of clients.
The shortage in job candidates is not an easy or quick problem to
address, experts said.
“It takes a long time to develop the instincts to be an effective
cybersecurity engineer. You can’t just come out of college and know what
to do,” said David Foote, a tech industry researcher and co-founder of
Foote Partners of Vero Beach, Florida.
“The threat landscape changes all the time, and that’s hard to train
for,” Kaiser added.
Foote said both government and private industry faced shortages: “In the
short term, it’s not looking good. There are so many employers who are
way behind in staffing.”
Efforts to poach cybersecurity experts occur at a blistering pace.
Some 46 percent of working cybersecurity professionals said they
received solicitations for other jobs “at least once per week,”
according to the State of Cyber Security Professional Careers, a survey
released last month jointly by the Enterprise Strategy Group and
Information Systems Security Association.
“Turnover in the cybersecurity ranks could represent an existential risk
to organizations in lower-paying industries like academia, health care,
the public sector and retail,” the survey said.
In the federal government’s push to expand cybersecurity training, it
has targeted all levels of education, including $125 million in National
Science Foundation grants to primary and secondary schools. It has also
designated nearly 200 colleges and universities as National Centers of
Academic Excellence in Cyber Defense.
Many universities are gearing up programs to meet the surge in demand.
“We will start teaching the first group of students in two weeks,” said
Alan M. Usas, the director of the new executive master’s in
cybersecurity program at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.
“Interest has been extremely high.”
But luring younger students into cybersecurity can be a tough sell.
“People who are graduating from college are looking for the next killer
app or to create the next startup,” said Katrina Timlin, an associate
fellow in the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies, a Washington think tank.
Cybersecurity has little of the cachet of other areas of information
technology, such as machine learning, and cybersecurity experts aren’t
even always loved at their own companies. Their departments are not
revenue generators. And their constant efforts to penetrate systems can
raise hackles.
“They have to have that nonconformist edge where they can pick apart a
problem. That kind of personality pushes some people’s buttons,” Timlin
As they look for flaws in existing networks and systems, cybersecurity
experts can find themselves at loggerheads with technology engineers who
built the systems, she said.
Cybersecurity encompasses far more than just technology issues.
“Most every company that has an internet presence by definition is a
global company,” Usas said. When hacks occur, “there’s forensic work
that needs to be done,” he added, but often legal and policy issues come
into play, as well as human behavior analysis.
“There are a number of straight deep tech jobs, but there are also a
number of hybrid jobs,” Foote said, noting that computer hacks can
affect accounting and finance divisions, as well as logistics, marketing
and legal affairs.
Those who are already established in cybersecurity and leading teams at
companies are well-compensated.
“There is some talk out there, I’ve heard it, that lead software
security engineers are making $230,000 and $240,000 a year. It’s crazy,”
said Foote.
Foote’s consulting firm receives compensation data from 2,914 employers
who report on what they pay 255,650 full-time technology professionals.
In the most recent quarter, Foote said, the firm found an average salary
of $99,000 for a cyber security specialist with three years’ experience
in design, deployment and administration of security systems. For a more
senior employee with at least five years of experience and strong
knowledge of digital controls and protection strategies, the national
average salary is $118,000.
Cybersecurity jobs in the United States pay an average of $6,500 more
than other information technology professions, a premium of 9 percent,
according to a July report, Hacking the Skills Shortage, by Intel
Security and the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

More on the delusional behavior that might be exhibited if you're
'touched in da haid' enough to  believe your own delusions about
'simulation', as translated into strategy and tactics.
"The Chalabi Card".
Juan Cole, professor of Persian studies, recounts a convo between
AIPAC's BFF Doug Feith, who was head of the "Department of Lying to the
American Public" at the Pentagon during the run-up to the War on Iraq,
with a low-level State Department employee he was teaching during his
short stint at one of the  power-elite's Peer Reviewed institutions...
Georgetown University:
"State Dept. Official: “Doug, after the smoke clears, what is the plan?”
Feith: “Think of Iraq as being like a computer. And think of Saddam as
like a processor. We just take out the old processor, and put in a new
State Dept. Official: “Put in a new processor?”
Feith: “Yes! It will all be over in 6 weeks.”
State Dept. Official: “You mean six months.”
Feith: “No, six weeks. You’ll see.”
State Dept. Official: “Doug.”
Feith: “Yes?”
State Dept. Official: “You’re smoking crack, Doug.”
Feith: “Oh, so you’re disloyal to the President, are you?”
Verification of Feith’s belief in a 'short war’ was published by the
National Security Archive and it SEEMED to be due to the apparent fact
that Chalabi and friends channeled funds to ostensibly sympathetic
people in Iraq’s government… They REALLY expected the US to just walk
in, greeted with flowers, because “Delusional”.

“First, they assumed that a provisional government would be in place by
‘D-Day’, then that the Iraqis would stay in their garrisons and be
reliable partners, and finally that the post-hostilities phase would be
a matter of mere ‘months’. ”

You started talking about you gay friends then it was a about you. OK...
But you've failed to respond to my point. The police in the US kill
black people, take bribes, rape women, but that's NOT legitimate
government policy. There's footage on the web of a couple of Moscow cops
with a transvestite in the car for some reason. They release her and
then crack up laughing. Take your pick. Some cops are thugs. Some think
TVs and gayfolk are unusual and funny, but most Russians simply don't
care, AND my POINT is THERE ARE NO DISCRIMINATORY LEGAL POLICIES and
haven't been since 1917.
What a couple of pigs did to your gay friends is pretty irrelevant to
laws regarding being gay in Russia. There are none. There ARE right wing
reactionaries though. They tend to be cops. In the US too.
Soros and co's LGBT 'rights' plan won't solve that. It would most likely
bring on REACTION. As in REACTIONARY.

Interpreting Data About ISIS Online
Oct 6, 2016
Challenging ISIS has little to do with their number of followers, or the
decline in their number of messages. This type of tactical-level data
can indicate success, but genuine impact can only occur with robust
interpretation of data at the strategic level.
Recent studies have been used to claim success in reducing the number of
followers and volume of ISIS content on social media. Reports which
appear to show decline are seized on and used by many of the Public
Diplomacy and Information Operations strategies deployed against ISIS,
which seek opportunities to highlight failures and losses of the group.
Yet it is equally clear that, despite increasing efforts by western
governments and social media providers to counter ISIS online, ISIS
continues to produce and disseminate large quantities of
ideologically-inspired audio visual content and information. Equally,
individuals who have never had direct contact with the group commit acts
of violence in their name.
As such, it is often the case that the detail tells a different story
than some of the claims made about the data, specifically that ISIS is
experiencing a decline in followers and content on Twitter.<
Decline in the Number of Twitter Followers
The decline in the number of followers is frequently cited by those
seeking to emphasize success against ISIS. I’ve written previously about
the significant problems in the data collection and analysis in one of
the frequently cited studies. Even so, this study is cited as showing a
decline in follower numbers, despite actually concluding that
“suspensions held the size and reach of the overall network flat, while
devastating the reach of specific users who have been repeatedly targeted.”
Claims of success against an adversary must account for fluctuations in
said adversary’s tactics.
Social media platforms are fundamentally social networks. The metrics
about followers which Twitter produces are accurate for an individual
account, but cannot simply be aggregated to show the total number of
followers in a specific network. If number of followers is aggregated,
it will likely produce wildly inflated numbers for reach, and equally
overstate the decline in ISIS social media.
The falling follower fallacy is demonstrated in the image below. In it,
the same nodes are shown connected in different configurations, similar
to the three types or topologies John Arquilla and David Ronfeldt
highlighted in their discussion of Netwar.
Reading left to right, the different layouts demonstrate that:
    Aggregating follower numbers inflates the number of accounts that
appear to be in the network.
    The decline in aggregated follower numbers cannot be read as showing
decline in the number of accounts in the network.
    The decline in aggregated follower numbers cannot be used to show
that the network is being disrupted.
Ultimately, the Twitter strategy is to disseminate content, not gather
followers. In fact, distributing content rather than gaining followers
is the stated objective within ISIS networks, and as shown here, this is
entirely possible despite declining aggregate follower numbers..."

"Hagbard Celine’s gigantic computer, FUCKUP-First Universal
Cybernetic-Kinetic-Ultramicro-Programmer- was basically a rather
sophisticated form of the standard self-programming algorithmic logic
machine of the time; the name was one of his whimsies.
FUCKUP’s real claim to uniqueness was a programmed stochastic process
whereby it could “throw” an I Ching hexagram, reading’ a random open
circuit as a broken (yin) line and a random closed circuit as a full
(yang) line until six such “lines” were round.
Consulting its memory banks, where the whole tradition of I Ching
interpretation was stored, and then cross-checking its current scannings
of that day’s political, economic, meteorological, astrological,
astronomical, and technological eccentricities, it would provide a
reading of the hexagram which, to Hagbard’s mind, combined the best of
the scientific and occult methods for spotting oncoming trends.
On March 13, the stochastic pattern spontaneously generated Hexagram 23,
“Breaking Apart.”
FUCKUP then interpreted:
        “This traditionally unlucky sign was cast by Atlantean
scientist-priests shortly before the destruction of their continent and
is generally connected with death by water. Other vibrations link it to
earthquakes, tornadoes and similar disasters, and to sickness, decay,
and morbidity as well.
        The first correlation is with the unbalance between
technological acceleration and political retrogression, which has
proceeded earth-wide at ever widening danger levels since 1914 and
especially since 1964.
        The breaking apart is fundamentally the schizoid and schismatic
mental fugue of lawyer-politicians attempting to administrate a
worldwide technology whose mechanisms they lack the education to
comprehend and whose gestalt trend they frustrate by breaking apart into
obsolete Renaissance nation-states.
        World War III is probably imminent and, considering the advances
in chemical biological warfare in conjunction with the sickness
vibrations of Hexagram 23, the unleashing of plague or nerve gas or both
is as probable as thermonuclear overkill.
        General prognosis: many megadeaths.
        There is some hope for avoidance of the emerging pattern with
prompt action of correct nature.

Then there are people who talk about people when the people they're
discussing it with, typically friends, ARE IN DANGER OR POTENTIALLY
THREATENED due to the person being discussed.
Police Snitching and careless talk/influence peddling people get stitches.
Sharing important intelligence with comrades does not seem to have that
effect. You wouldn't tell one of your drug dealing comrades you
suspected someone was a narc? If not, Why? More biz for you while the
other dealer's sitting in jail perhaps?
PSychological trolling injures the innocent.
Let's say, for giggles because it isn't the case, that I had just ended
a relationship and was feeling depressed and not interested in someone
else's advances, and I was receiving mail like that?
Innocent and injured. Perhaps driven to suicide eh?
Posting private messages in public, without
Someone sending unsolicited emails, especially when they're requested to
desist is "dishonorable and it demonstrates that the perpetrator cannot

101 Ways I Screwed Up Making a Fake Identity
Posted on October 13, 2016 by hacks4pancakes	
As most of you know, my professional area of expertise in security is
incident response, with an emphasis on system / malware forensics and
OSINT. I’m fortunate enough in my position in the security education and
con community to sometimes get pulled into other directions of blue
teaming and the occasional traditional penetration testing. However, the
rarest of those little fun excursions are into the physical pen testing
and social engineering realm. In the breaking into buildings and
pretending to be a printer tech realm, I’m merely a hobbyist.🙂
Therefore, it was a bit remarkable that in the course of developing some
training, there was a request for me to create some fake online personas
that would hold up against moderately security savvy users. I think most
of us have created an online alter ego to some extent, but these needed
to be pretty comprehensive to stand up to some scrutiny. Just making an
email account wasn’t going to cut it.
So Pancakes went on an adventure into Backstop land. And made a lot of
amusing mistakes and learned quite a few things on the way. I’ll share
some of them here, so the social engineers can have a giggle and offer
suggestions in the comments, and the other hobbyists can learn from my
mistakes. Yes, there are automated tools that will help you do this if
you have to do it in bulk for work, but many of the problems still
exist. (Please keep in mind that misrepresenting yourself on these
services can cause your account to be suspended or banned, so if you’re
doing more than academic security  education or research, do cover your
legal bases.)

All he said was something about the people at the site oking it, but he
never stated who (didn't expect him to divulge that info) and waffled
when asked if Barrett's people had authorized it or the server's OWNER
had authorized it, then shut the convo down.
The IP is currently registered to "Incapsula" which appears to be

Sigh... Theo Roszak proposed that money and power are really just
substitutes for, or ways of obtaining, life extension. But that doesn't
mean age is considered wealth and power in Capitalist societies (though
it sure does in the few undamaged tribal societies left)
I ascribe to the idea that accumulation of wealth and political power
(which is for the most part the equivalent of social power over society
and it's individuals) for the sake of those items dynamic in controlling
the continuation of wealth and power (hence social control) in the hands
of oneself and one's friends is a pretty good place to begin, anyway.
That implies for a start, that the wealth and power aren't shared
voluntarily by that group and they conspire to keep it that way (in
private). Monarchies and dictatorships are examples. The US is
essentially a two faction soft dictatorship. 'Soft' in the sense that
the dictators, neuropsychologically preened for media 'candidates'

@_subject: =?UTF-8?Q?Search_Risk_=e2=80=93_How_Google_Almost_Killed_ProtonMail?= 
In the past two months, many of you have reached out to us to ask about
the mysterious tweets we sent to Google in August. At ProtonMail,
transparency is a core value, and we try to be as transparent with our
community as possible. As many people have continued to point out to us,
we need to be more transparent here to avoid continued confusion and
speculation. Thus, we are telling the full story today to clarify what
What Happened?
The short summary is that for nearly a year, Google was hiding
ProtonMail from search results for queries such as ‘secure email’ and
‘encrypted email’. This was highly suspicious because ProtonMail has
long been the world’s largest encrypted email provider.
When ProtonMail launched in Beta back in May 2014, our community rapidly
grew as people from around the world came together and supported us in
our mission to protect privacy in the digital age. Our record breaking
crowdfunding campaign raised over half a million dollars from
contributors and provided us with the resources to make ProtonMail
competitive against even the biggest players in the email space.
By the summer of 2015, ProtonMail passed half a million users and was
the world’s most well known secure email service. ProtonMail was also
ranking well in Google search at this time, on the first or second page
of most queries including “encrypted email” and “secure email”. However,
by the end of October 2015, the situation had changed dramatically, and
ProtonMail was mysteriously no longer showing up for searches of our two
main keywords.
Between the beginning of the summer and the fall of 2015, ProtonMail did
undergo a lot of changes. We released ProtonMail 2.0, we went fully open
source, we launched mobile apps in beta, and we updated our website,
changing our TLD from .ch to the more widely known .com. We also doubled
in size, growing to nearly 1 million users by the fall. All of these
changes should have helped ProtonMail’s search rankings as we became
more and more relevant to more people.
In November 2015, we became aware of the problem and consulted a number
of well known SEO experts. None of them could explain the issue,
especially since ProtonMail has never used any blackhat SEO tactics, nor
did we observe any used against us. Mysteriously, the issue was entirely
limited to Google, as this anomaly was not seen on any other search
engine. Below are the search rankings for ProtonMail for ‘secure email’
and ‘encrypted email’ taken at the beginning of August 2016 across all
major search engines. We rank on either page 1 or 2 everywhere except
Google where we are not ranked at all.
image: protonmail seo rankings
All throughout Spring 2016, we worked in earnest to get in touch with
Google. We created two tickets on their web spam report form explaining
the situation. We even contacted Google’s President EMEA Strategic
Relationships, but received no response nor improvement. Around this
time, we also heard about the anti-trust action brought forward by the
European Commission against Google, accusing Google of abusing its
search monopoly to lower the search rankings of Google competitors. This
was worrying news, because as an email service that puts user privacy
first, we are the leading alternative to Gmail for those looking for
better data privacy.
In August, with no other options, we turned to Twitter to press our
case. This time though, we finally got a response, thanks in large part
to the hundreds of ProtonMail users who drew attention to the issue and
made it impossible to ignore. After a few days, Google informed us that
they had “fixed something” without providing further details. The
results could be immediately seen.
image: google protonmail search risk
ProtonMail Google Search Ranking for “Encrypted Email”
In the above plots, the x-axis is time and the y-axis is search ranking
(lower number is better). The dates where there are no data points are
times when we are not ranked at all by Google. After Google made some
changes, ProtonMail’s rankings immediately recovered and are now ranked
 and  for ‘secure email’ and ‘encrypted email’ respectively. Without
any additional explanation from Google, we may never know why ProtonMail
become unranked. In any case, we do appreciate Google finally taking
action to resolve the issue, we just wished it happened sooner.
The Danger of Search Risk
This incident however highlights a previously unrecognized danger that
we are now calling Search Risk. The danger is that any service such as
ProtonMail can easily be suppressed by either search companies, or the
governments that control those search companies. This can happen even
across national borders. For example, even though Google is an American
company, it controls over 90% of European search traffic. In this case,
Google directly caused ProtonMail’s growth rate worldwide to be reduced
by over 25% for over 10 months.
This meant that ProtonMail’s income from users was also cut by 25%,
putting financial pressure on our operations. We went from being able to
cover all our monthly expenses to having to draw from our emergency
reserve fund. The lost income and financial damage incurred as a result
was several hundred thousand Swiss Francs (1 CHF = 1.01 USD), which will
never be reimbursed.
The only reason we survived to tell this story is because the majority
of ProtonMail’s growth comes from word of mouth, and our community is
too loud to be ignored. Many other companies won’t be so fortunate. This
episode illustrates that Search Risk is serious, which is why we now
agree with the European Commission that given Google’s dominant position
in search, more transparency and oversight is critical.

implement our disastrous policies but are an overwhelming lobby for

(He continued as the audience sat in stunned silence.)
“The best service you people could perform is rather rapidly to phase
yourselves out, passing on your relevant knowledge to people better
qualified, or reorganizing yourselves with entirely different sponsors
and commitments, so that you learn to think and feel in a different way.
Since you are most of the R&D [research and development] that there is,
we cannot do without you as people, but we cannot do with you as you are.”
(laughter and booing along with scattered applause)
“but we believe, however, that that way of life is unnecessary, ugly,
and un-American.”
(Shouts from the audience: “Who are ‘we’?”)
“We are I and those people outside —we cannot condone your present
operations; they should be wiped off the slate.”

The Bundy Boiz acquitted of "Conspiracy to impede federal officers
through intimidation, threats or force".
Oregon militants acquitted of conspiracy in wildlife refuge seizure
By Scott Bransford
PORTLAND, Ore. A federal court jury delivered a surprise verdict on
Thursday acquitting anti-government militant leader Ammon Bundy and six
followers of conspiracy charges stemming from their role in the armed
takeover of a wildlife center in Oregon earlier this year.
The outcome marked a stinging defeat for federal prosecutors and law
enforcement in a trial the defendants sought to turn into a pulpit for
airing their opposition to U.S. government control over millions of
acres of public lands in the West.
Bundy and others, including his brother and co-defendant Ryan Bundy,
cast the 41-day occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge as a
patriotic act of civil disobedience. Prosecutors called it a lawless
scheme to seize federal property by force.
Jubilant supporters of the Bundys thronged the courthouse after the
verdict, hailing the trial's outcome as vindication of a political
ideology that is profoundly distrustful of federal authority and
challenges its legitimacy.
"We're so grateful to the jurors who weren't swayed by the nonsense that
was going on," defendant Shawna Cox told reporters. "God said we weren't
guilty. We weren't guilty of anything."
As the seven-week-long trial in the U.S. District Court in Portland
climaxed, U.S. marshals wrestled to the floor Ammon Bundy's lawyer,
Marcus Mumford, as he argued heatedly with the judge over the terms of
his client's continued detention.
The Bundys still face assault, conspiracy and other charges from a
separate armed standoff in 2014 at the Nevada ranch of their father,
Cliven Bundy, triggered when federal agents seized his cattle for his
failure to pay grazing fees for his use of public land.
The outcome of the Oregon trial clearly shocked many in the packed
courtroom. Attorneys exchanged looks of astonishment with the
defendants, then hugged their clients as the not-guilty verdicts were
read amid gasps from spectators.
Outside the courthouse, supporters celebrated by shouting "Hallelujah"
and reading passages from the U.S. Constitution. One man rode his horse,
named Lady Liberty, in front of the courthouse carrying an American flag.
The verdict came after four days of deliberations. One juror, a former
federal employee, was dismissed over questions of bias on Wednesday and
replaced by a substitute.
The 12-member panel found all seven defendants - six men and a woman -
not guilty of the most serious charge, conspiracy to impede federal
officers through intimidation, threats or force. That charge alone
carried a maximum penalty of six years in prison.
The defendants also were acquitted of illegal possession of firearms in
a federal facility and theft of government property, except in the case
of Ryan Bundy, for whom jurors were deadlocked on the charge of theft.
The takeover of the wildlife refuge was initially sparked by outrage
over the plight of two imprisoned Oregon ranchers the occupiers believed
had been unfairly treated in an arson case. But the militants said they
were also protesting larger grievances at what they saw as government
The standoff led to the shooting death of one protester, Robert "LaVoy"
Finicum, by police shortly after the Bundy brothers were arrested, and
left parts of the refuge badly damaged.
More than two dozen people, in all, have been criminally charged in the
occupation, and a second group of defendants is due to stand trial in
Mumford told reporters he believed Ammon and Ryan Bundy would remain in
custody for the time being but may be transferred to Nevada.
Four co-defendants were free on their own recognizance during the trial.
A fifth, David Fry, the last of the occupiers to surrender in February,
was released hours after the verdict.

Something Paul Goodman, founder of Gestalt Therapy and Anarchist said to
some technologists in 1967 comes to mind
"...speaking by invitation to the National Security Industrial
Association —a consortium of arms manufacturers at the October 1967
“Research and Development in the 1970s.” symposium, Washington DC:
    “You are the military industrial [complex] of the United States, the
most dangerous body of men at present in the world, for you not only
implement our disastrous policies but are an overwhelming lobby for
them, and you expand and rigidify the wrong use of brains, resources,
and labor so that change becomes difficult.”
    (He continued as the audience sat in stunned silence.)
    “The best service you people could perform is rather rapidly to
phase yourselves out, passing on your relevant knowledge to people
better qualified, or reorganizing yourselves with entirely different
sponsors and commitments, so that you learn to think and feel in a
different way.
    Since you are most of the R&D [research and development] that there
is, we cannot do without you as people, but we cannot do with you as you
    (laughter and booing along with scattered applause)
    “but we believe, however, that that way of life is unnecessary,
ugly, and un-American.”
    (Shouts from the audience: “Who are ‘we’?”)
    “We are I and those people outside —we cannot condone your present
operations; they should be wiped off the slate.”
All the R&D and so-called intelligence applied to software and computer
development is USELESS to anyone but the 'war machine' if it's all about
ME, and not "those people outside".

Discrimination by Design "Discriminatory design and decision-making affects all aspects of our
lives: from the quality of our health care and education to where we
live to what scientific questions we choose to ask. It would be
impossible to cover them all, so we’ll focus on the more tangible and
visual design that humans interact with every day.
You can’t talk about discriminatory design without mentioning city
planner Robert Moses, whose public works projects shaped huge swaths of
New York City from the 1930s through the 1960s. The physical design of
the environment is a powerful tool when it’s used to exclude and isolate
specific groups of people. And Moses’ design choices have had lasting
discriminatory effects that are still felt in modern New York.
A notorious example: Moses designed a number of Long Island Parkway
overpasses to be so low that buses could not drive under them. This
effectively blocked Long Island from the poor and people of color who
tend to rely more heavily on public transportation..."

pretty much hedonists and apolitical, into hard core antiwar

Peer Review is the main root of the ignorance I see in Academia. Modern
education in the US and much of Europe is not much more than
indoctrination, and peer-review enforces a situation where only vetted
indoctrinators may address the inquiring and malleable minds of young
people. Including inculcating such nonsense as 'patriotism' to a

Sociopolitical beliefs inculcated in those minds that make them conform

Yup. It was dead after the 3rd or 4th year like most events that occur
annually. Mavericks surf contest did quite well for itself until it
became a nationally known event. Now it's trash.  The Rainbow Gathering
was probably the longest standing before it became decrepit. It still
happens every year. There's NO ADMISSION FEE, and it is truly Anarchic.
I know mostly the younger set that attends Burning Man. Mostly affluent
college students... They leave their anarchy and 'gifting' onsite. It
DOES NOT become part of their day to day ethic at all.
Why? was the other option for the techie hipsters to call in their GEO
security teams with attack dogs? I wouldn't put it past them.
Not all. I named a couple of occupations that serve no useful purpose to
humanity though. The Riseup birds aren't in that category, nor, in the
larger sense than torproject, is ioerror and folks like him (Stewart
Brand, not technically a coder but...). Not many  left now, and the end
result? Not much innovation. Just polishing apples that have been on the
shelf for years. flashier graphics, miniaturization, speed, but that's
kind of it. It all came to a screeching halt after streaming video blew
the marketing end of the internet wide open in a latter day "Gold Rush"
for marketers. It was inevitable. Just like TV went from information
tool to an entertainment medium, so went the intertubz for 99% of it's
users today.
People interested in money create money no matter what industry they're
in and the product is just the vehicle to do that. Money is a lousy sole
driving force for development and innovation.
If those guys were making the same wage as a bagboy at a grocery store
do you suppose they'd be coding? Coders used to make supermarket worker
wages, never complained, worked themselves to literal exhaustion and
burned their eyes out on Green-Black/Yellow-Black dot matrix monitors,
and they loved it. Because it was about the code (hardware, whatever).
Not the money.
So get a job as a proofer or editor at the guardian... CopyNazi.

mountains until they heart attack or stroke out in their 40s.
You're talking about people whose only focus in life is making money.

revolve around money.IF they did any of the things you're romantically
mentioning ... thinking about cunts like Larry Ellison, it's hobby, or
something they did to look good for the other fratbrats at kollege.
They're dead meat unless they're dealing with an unruly drunk at a fern
bar who'd fall over if you shoved them anyway.
That's why the top dogs travel with bodyguards. Too many potential
enemies, and a killer instinct that works well firing an administrative
assistant or to put a thousand people out of work in the shareholder's
interest ('lots of enemies') but simply doesn't cut it at 'street level'.
Most don't even have the smarts to hide their rollie when they go
slumming but getting mugged is going to make for good water cooler
stories where they can talk it up, unless they're like that google exec

I don't think anyone is being paid specifically to troll this list to

getting them to respond in 'anger' or with other emotions. Emotional
responses, like panicked responses in real life, are often fubar and on
a list like this 'fubar' might reveal information about yourself to add

I alway check new twitter followers for bots and data mining. Especially

sweeping for the word "market" and found it here:
 as a
tweet of a Le Monde Diplomatique link regarding the topic "If they're
going to take your data to market at you you should be getting paid for it"
MIT Technology Review:
Scientists at the Computational Story Laboratory have analyzed novels to
identify the building blocks of all stories.
by Emerging Technology from the arXiv July 6, 2016
Back in 1995, Kurt Vonnegut gave a lecture in which he described his
theory about the shapes of stories. In the process, he plotted several
examples on a blackboard. “There is no reason why the simple shapes of
stories can’t be fed into computers,” he said. “They are beautiful
shapes.” The video is available on YouTube.
Vonnegut was representing in graphical form an idea that writers have
explored for centuries—that stories follow emotional arcs, that these
arcs can have different shapes, and that some shapes are better suited
to storytelling than others.
Vonnegut mapped out several arcs in his lecture. These include the
simple arc encapsulating “man falls into hole, man gets out of hole” and
the more complex one of “boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl.”
Vonnegut is not alone in attempting to categorize stories into types,
although he was probably the first to do it in graphical form. Aristotle
was at it over 2,000 years before him, and many others have followed in
his footsteps.
However, there is little agreement on the number of different emotional
arcs that arise in stories or their shape. Estimates vary from three
basic patterns to more than 30. But there is little in the way of
scientific evidence to favor one number over another.
Today (ed. Here in the future... -Rr), that changes thanks to the work
of Andrew Reagan at the Computational Story Lab at the University of
Vermont in Burlington and a few pals. These guys have used sentiment
analysis to map the emotional arcs of over 1,700 stories and then used
data-mining techniques to reveal the most common arcs. “We find a set of
six core trajectories which form the building blocks of complex
narratives,” they say.

When I was that age (late 1950s, NYC area) television was, not new, but
new as a common household 'appliance' everyone aspired to own. The
'lucky ones' had 'color' tvs that were absolutely awful by modern
standards but most people had B&W sets. When I watched TeeVee it was
with the rest of the family, like an outing, or going to a movie. There
was always an adult there to help me out with complex concepts (and
violence... "Racket Squad, The Untouchables, and Highway Patrol were
just as bloody as a modern war movie).
Later in their history teevees became babysitters with no adult
attending. It does make a difference to have an adult nearby watching
teevee with you if you're a child, and not just a chronological adult
which is what many are now days after being babysat by teevee until they
were terminally 'dumbed' and numbed.
This is how you get that way:

I can provide an example from mindfuck ops in relation to another time

serving a stint on the LA Sheriff's Public Disorder Unit as a snitch
they pulled the plug on him, stuck him in Atascadero (or was it
Vacaville...) State Prison for the Criminally Insane California, and
when released, after having been there when the last of the OG MKULTRA
shrinks was practicing, seem to have developed the capability to
attract, as the news guy I did archiving for put it: "Idealistic,
Intellectual Female Victims".
They have profiles for activists too.
He met many of them through a 'radical' prisoner visiting program run
by, apparently, the CIA, called the "Black Cultural Association" if I
recall. It's in the links below. Perhaps 'he' now meetsa them on

Also in the tweetstream, another twitter user posted a screenshot of a
very disgruntled black man's tweet claiming Darren Seals, the murder
victim, shut him down at a meeting about some topic or another. Not that
that individual was the murderer, but that IS HOW COINTELPRO operates,
by diverting people to think their cause is more important, that someone
'disrespected' or is a fed.
Leonard Peltier is doing life because SOMEONE COINTELPRO-affiliated

Regarding the number of Jews killed. Every official authority including
Russian sources estimate the number of dead between 4-8 million.
There's a lot of variance because of HOW it's decided whether the deaths
were related to Nazi government action or not. It will NEVER be totally
settled, so most just uses the 6 million number.
As a more recent example there's dispute over the number of Iraqis
killed by the US for similar reasons. International law holds that the
invader is responsible for securing the invaded space and is responsible
for all deaths including civilian on civilian murder etc.
The US, ofc, doesn't buy that, or that they're responsible for the mass
fratricide they cause arming ethnic groups against each other for it's
own purposes. So the numbers will vary.
As a Jew, what I don't want to see are Jews denying there were/are
holocausts happening just as tragic every moment we're alive and for
some reason the Nazi holocaust was somehow worse than, lets say, what
the US did, is doing, to the indigenous people.
Many Jews think like that. Ours is the only Holocaust. As my Bessarabian
grandpa, chased across the region by the Bishkek pogroms of the late
1800s(?)  would have said "Ishkabibble". Yiddish slang for nonsense, and
the people pushing that POV on Jews HAVE an agenda, and funding for it
from Zionists who hope the international community will let them have
their way with Palestinians 'b/c holocaust'.

There's are a number of reasons why 'teh gubmint wants ur dataz', and
it's not ONLY about killing 'terrorists' or suppressing potential
insurrection. It's about ripping you off for every penny they and their
corporate BFFs can shake out of you.
Big Data Isn’t Just Watching You—It’s Making You Poorer
Cathy O’Neil’s new book, Weapons of Math Destruction, shows mathematical
models aren’t free of ideology.
BY Pankaj Mehta, In These Times, Sept 6 2016
By some estimates, humanity now produces 2.5 quintillion bytes of data
every day—more than a hundred times the amount of data in the entire
Library of Congress. This data ranges from Facebook posts to
military-grade satellite photos. Increasingly, this data is analyzed by
complex mathematical models that determine more and more aspects of our
lives, from the advertisements we see to whether we have access to
private insurance. Yet despite their growing importance, these models
often remain hidden.
Advocates of such mathematical modeling, in both the public and private
sectors, portray it as a neutral and efficient alternative to fallible
and biased human decision-making. Mathematician, data scientist and
popular blogger Cathy O’Neil, author of Weapons of Math Destruction: How
Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy, doesn’t agree.
She argues that many mathematical models are ideological tools that
exacerbate oppression and inequality. Her examples range from the crime
models used by police departments to determine which neighborhoods to
patrol, to the recidivism models used by judges to hand out prison
O’Neil is passionate about exposing the harmful effects of Big
Data–driven mathematical models (what she calls WMDs), and she’s
uniquely qualified for the task. She earned a Ph.D. in math from Harvard
and landed a tenure-track at Barnard. But she became bored with the pace
and insularity of academia, and left to work as a quantitative analyst
at the hedge fund D.E. Shaw. There, she had a front-row seat for the
2008 financial crisis.
This experience fundamentally changed O’Neil’s relationship to
mathematics. She realized that far from being a neutral object of study,
mathematics was not only “deeply entangled in the world’s problems but
also fueling many of them.” People in power were “deliberately
[wielding] formulas to impress rather than clarify.” This
disillusionment led O’Neil to get involved with Occupy Wall Street and
start educating the public about the dangers of WMDs through her blog,
She is careful to point out that there is nothing inherently destructive
about mathematical modeling. Sophisticated data modeling enables much of
modern technology, from wireless communication to drug discovery. How
can one distinguish a destructive math model from an ordinary, or even
helpful, one? O’Neil identifies three key features of WMDs: lack of
transparency, lack of fairness and, most importantly, operation on a
massive scale.
O’Neil grounds her argument in case studies of WMDs in a variety of
settings: finance, higher education, the criminal justice system, online
advertising, employment decisions and scheduling, and credit and
insurance provision. The “value-added” model for teacher evaluation,
which looks at improvements in individual students’ test scores—a
favorite of the so-called “educational reform” movement—is touted as an
objective measure of a teacher’s worth. Yet this is far from the truth.
O’Neil cites an analysis by blogger and educator Gary Rubinstein of New
York’s 2010 value-added scores for public school teachers. O’Neil
explains that “Of teachers who taught the same subject in consecutive
years, one in four registered a 40-point difference. [This] suggests
that the evaluation data is practically random.” O’Neil argues that this
is because the value-added model, which relies on predictions of student
performance, suffers from a built-in logical flaw: No statistical model
can accurately make predictions about a class of 25 or 30 students—the
sample size is too small. Yet the high-stakes testing regime continues
to wreak havoc on the trajectories of students and teachers alike.
Other WMDs, known as e-scores, use data such as ZIP codes, web-surfing
patterns and recent purchases to evaluate a person’s credit-worthiness.
Unlike the more familiar FICO credit scores that are freely available
and regulated by the government, these secretive e-scores are
“unaccountable, unregulated and often unfair.” Whereas FICO scores are
based on your own financial history, e-scores compare you to other
people with similar profiles. This may seem benign, but it can result in
feedback loops that reinforce existing social inequities. If you live in
a poor ZIP code, then your e-score will drop, meaning less credit and
higher interest rates—essentially, an algorithmic redlining of the poor
and working class.

The power elite (and yes that includes her shill the 1/2-elite Donald
Trump) have chosen her to be president. She manipulates the levers of
power and war in exactly the manner maximizing the ROI on whatever their
particular interest are. They want it to stay just... like... that.
Further, the resources gained via (diplomatic) power and war are getting
scarce, and due to the need for wars to acquire them, are also quite
expensive . Factories across the planet operate on JIT inventories of
many of those materials (oil, other extractive resources up the supply
chain), and disruption of that flow, even momentarily, threatens their
ROI and has the potential to cause continued disruptions. They can't
allow that, and Hillary knows it, so if she wants to manipulate those
levers they might literally 'work her to death' just getting to the
'levers'. She IS an employee, and the bennies are world class, so she does.
There are people (no more interested in shutting the MACHINE down than
Clinton) who would oppose that plan for her leadership of the US and
they will pounce on every opportunity to weaken her chances. Including
the fact that she's an old lady and the grueling business of
campaigning, no less running the MACHINE might be beyond her physical
capacity. My grandmother passed in 1967 from complications of
Pneumonia.She was just a couple of years older than Clinton is today,
and was not in bad health... Had rarely been to doctors previously.

But you never know it until you're in prison or dead, and you'd STILL
never find out about it. In court discovery motions the prosecutor would
claim their source is DHS-affiliated and to name it would cause problems
catching terrorists or some other bullshit, and a judge WILL buy that.

which they staunched, followed by an onslaught from a national actor in
collusion with that criminal element. It was very effective. They never

Whoever did this, U.S. says of latest hacks, we’re coming after you
With linkage @ Mcclatchy
By Tim Johnson
Top White House and Justice Department officials asked for patience from
the public Wednesday as they refused to say whether Russia or another
nation may be behind a new series of headline-grabbing hacks affecting
the realms of politics and sports.
But they promised that the hacks will not go unpunished – once they are
certain who is responsible for them.
“Whether you are a rogue hacker or a uniformed soldier, the shadowy
corners of the internet will not provide respite for long,” Attorney
General Loretta Lynch said.
A top Lynch deputy, John P. Carlin of the Justice Department’s National
Security Division, said the Obama administration would go after whoever
was responsible, even if they were operating as part of a foreign
government’s institutions.
“The message should be clear: You are not safe because you are operating
under another nation’s flag,” Carlin said. “We can figure out who did
it. It won’t remain anonymous.”
The warnings came as the interim chair of the Democratic National
Committee, Donna Brazile, blamed agents in Russia for the release of new
hacked DNC documents that she said were intended to influence the
outcome of November’s presidential election.
“There’s one person who stands to benefit from these criminal acts, and
that’s Donald Trump,” Brazile said in a statement. “Not only has Trump
embraced (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, he publicly encouraged
further Russian espionage to help his campaign.”
Whoever hacked the DNC, an act first reported in June, provided some
20,000 internal DNC emails to WikiLeaks, which released them a month
later. The hack has fueled concern that foreign cyber-agents might also
meddle directly in the November U.S. election.
Earlier this week, the World Anti-Doping Agency reported that its
database had been penetrated by a Russian espionage group, known as
Fancy Bear, that released information on four U.S. athletes – gymnast
Simone Biles, tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams, and basketball
player Elena Delle Donne. The confidential medical data showed that the
four had used medicines that usually are banned but that may be used
with approval from the International Olympic Committee to treat certain
medical conditions. All four had received permission.
Hundreds of Russian athletes were barred from competing in last month’s
Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro due to suspicions of widespread
Lisa O. Monaco, President Barack Obama’s top aide on homeland security
and counterterrorism, declined to blame Russia for the latest hacks but
said finger-pointing would come soon enough.
“Folks should stay tuned,” Monaco said at a forum at the Center for
Strategic & International Studies to honor the Justice Department’s
Division of National Security.
“We know Russia is a bad actor in cyberspace, just as China has been,
just as Iran has been,” Monaco said. “Nobody should think that there is
a free pass when you’re conducting malicious cyber-activity.”
“Our reach is long,” added Monaco, a former assistant attorney general.
“Sometimes it takes a long time to build a case but it doesn’t deter us
from pursuing it.”
Lynch noted that U.S. prosecutors in 2014 had charged five members of
China’s People’s Liberation Army with hacking U.S. companies to benefit
Chinese industry. Last year, prosecutors charged seven Iranians,
allegedly linked to the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, with
planning to hack U.S. banks and a New York State dam in an attempt to
disrupt its operation.
Before the indictments of the Chinese army members, Carlin said, few
thought the U.S. government would seriously go after hackers linked to
foreign governments.
“There was a period of time when folks said, ‘Cyber-espionage, Chinese
espionage, there’s nothing you can do about it. It’s too hard. They’re
going to be able to remain anonymous, and this is just the world we have
to accept as the status quo,’ ” Carlin said.
But he said indictments against foreign hackers had proved otherwise.
“For those who think that, be it Russia or any other country, that
there’s going to be a free pass, that we can’t figure out what they are
doing in cyber-enabled espionage, the message should be clear,” he said.

Ps. Leonard Peltier made a statement in support of the NODAPL folks
today and SPECIFICALLY WARNED about being spied on:
"I have to caution you young people to be careful, for you are up
against a very evil group of people whose only concern is to fill their
pockets with even more gold and wealth. They could not care less how
many of you they have to kill or bury in a prison cell. They don’t care
if you are a young child or an old grandmother, and you better believe
they are and have been recruiting our own people to be snitches and
traitors. They will look to the drunks, the addicts, and child
molesters, those who prey on our old and our children; they look for the
weak-minded individuals.
You must remember to be very cautious about falsely accusing people
based more on personal opinion than on evidence. Be smart."

The law of the land is you have to identify yourself. You don't have to
produce papers unless you're operating a vehicle. Even then you don't
have to produce, but you'll get a fixit ticket for not having it with you.
OTOH, things can be 'different you're POC, homeless or poor... For
instance a homeless friend of mine was given a camping ticket last
winter. In the process the officer asked for his ID.
He informed the cop it was buried away for the night but he knew his
*Identification Number*. The cop told him that wasn't good enough, to
give him his *social security number*. My friend explained that was a
violation of US federal law... The number is SPECIFICALLY forbidden from
being used as general identification and it said so right on the card
... and the cop wouldn't want him to commit a federal crime, now would he?
The cop then said something truly chilling that went something like this:
This is the middle of the winter in a town where it can go to freezing
in the early morning.
My friend complied, under duress, and he wrote that on the ticket too. A
ticket that never got filed.
Postlogue: I did a check for my friend and found that if you don't have
identification information for a non-jailable offense (ie. infractions
in California) the solution is simple. A thumb-print on the ticket to
simply prove you were there. Every cop has a print kit in their car.
My friend said he was going to sue for privacy violation but never did.
It ain't easy being broke and houseless and trying to file a state level
civil rights suit on your own. I suspect they wanted his social security
number for a database of local homeless.

Guns make it so. Law enforcement owns about 99.9% of all the military
style weaponry.
Have you ever seen this bit In 1776, when the height of military technology was a musket and a
cannon, both of which you could make by melting down church bells, there
might have been something to it. When the contest was little more than
numbers of guns you could drag through the woods, and how to play the
weather, the government probably did need to worry a bit about
insurrection – and that might have kept them a bit more honest.
However, the first time someone tried that kind of thing, it didn't work
out so well. In fact, Shays' Rebellion just led to Constitutional tweaks
to make the federal government that much stronger. The Civil War led to
even more, with harsher consequences.
If 13 states, with the assistance of at least one superpower, didn't
manage to get their way through armed insurrection, what the hell makes
anyone think that armed insurgency is going to preserve our right to …
whatever … not have affordable health care, or to coffee cups that say
"Happy Birthday Jesus" on them?
Ok, fine… lets come up with a cause worth fighting for.
Lets say that Obama refuses to step down in 2016, and he not only
declares himself dictator-for-life, but he also starts dressing like
Ghadaffi, decrees that the national religion shall be Islam, the
national language will be Klingon, there will be an efficient rail
network in the United States, the writ of Prima Noctae is now in effect,
and there shall be martial law to enforce all of the above, as well as
any other laws that the President invents, on a daily basis.
We managed to preserve our right to keep military grade rifles and
machine guns, so we all muster down on the Town Common with our guns.
We tried voting.
We tried protesting.
This is a reasonable time to start with the armed insurrection stuff.
So, you, me, all our neighbors, hell our entire city builds a perimeter
around it. We fill sandbags, we all have ammunition, we all have food,
water, supplies, and most importantly, we are all unified and in
complete solidarity.
And we stand there, resisting whatever it is the government was going to
do to us.
And then they fly over with one jet, dropping one FAE bomb, and roll in
with three tanks, and in about 12 hours, our "resistance" is reduced to
a few smoking holes.
The Tree of Liberty will get its manure all right, but it will be the
manure that you shat out as you ran for cover, as long range artillery
rains down on our town, as we get carpet bombed from 35,000 feet, and as
the sky goes black with drones and cruise missiles.
We're screwed.
So… if the 2nd Amendment's "right to revolution" implication is real,
both practically and legally, it must also include a right to possess
tanks, jets, rocket launchers, etc.
Your puny AK-47 is useless. So, we need to have at least some of our
volunteer resistance show up with Stinger missiles, some anti-aircraft
batteries, maybe a submarine or two?
Oh, you can't afford that?
That's ok, we have some patriotic citizens who can.
The same billionaires who already own the government, that's who.
So what do they want to "resist?"
I could only see them wanting to resist checks on their own power.
So, if the Second Amendment implies a right to resist the government,
then that would mean that we need our billionaire friends to start
stockpiling these weapons now. We need a Koch brothers airfield with a
few fighters and bombers, and Adelson should have a fleet of tanks
somewhere, and I guess that George Soros would bring his collection of
nuke-armed submarines up to date, right?
So lets drop the crazy scenario of Obama-cum-Ghadaffi, and just think
about something we were really likely to see upset us. Do you think for
a moment that you, living in some apartment in Salt Lake City, or a
house in Wyoming, or a condo in Boca Raton, would be ready to go to war
with the Federal Government over the same shit that would get the Koch
Brothers to fuel up their private stock of A10 Warthogs? Really?
Because you know what the billionaires want the government to stop doing?
They want it to get out of the way of their becoming trillionaires.
If you think that the Second Amendment means what the Supreme Court said
in Heller, and you believe that is a good thing, because it gives you
the ability to resist the government, you might want to play out the
long game in your head.
The long game here is this interpretation leads to private armies,
raised by limitless wealth, all of which looks at our quaint little
republican form of government as nothing more than a paper justification
to have a flag waving over a few national parks."

There's an ideological difference between communism and capitalism.
Ideally communism should mean the elimination of greed as a driving
force in a society. Including greed for power.
However, as you described, the "American Revolution" was simply a
'transfer of pwnership of the levers of greed' from the Crown to rich
white men settlers by partially force, and partially the isolation from
Britain that made it simply too costly to pursue a full occupation, and
perhaps forced removal of their errant subjects.

In the original piece he spells out in great detail how the outcasts of
a society build a stronger, more resilient one.
They're also likely to be marauders. That's the end result of
cooperative societies ejecting the non-cooperative members.
They band together like the psychopaths they are, and exact vengeance on

"...speaking by invitation to the National Security Industrial
Association —a consortium of arms manufacturers at the October 1967
“Research and Development in the 1970s.” symposium, Washington DC:
    “You are the military industrial [complex] of the United States, the
most dangerous body of men at present in the world, for you not only
implement our disastrous policies but are an overwhelming lobby for
them, and you expand and rigidify the wrong use of brains, resources,
and labor so that change becomes difficult.”
    (He continued as the audience sat in stunned silence.)
    “The best service you people could perform is rather rapidly to
phase yourselves out, passing on your relevant knowledge to people
better qualified, or reorganizing yourselves with entirely different
sponsors and commitments, so that you learn to think and feel in a
different way.
    Since you are most of the R&D [research and development] that there
is, we cannot do without you as people, but we cannot do with you as you
    (laughter and booing along with scattered applause)
    “but we believe, however, that that way of life is unnecessary,
ugly, and un-American.”
    (Shouts from the audience: “Who are ‘we’?”)
    “We are I and those people outside —we cannot condone your present
operations; they should be wiped off the slate.”
All the R&D and so-called intelligence applied to software and computer
development is USELESS to anyone but the 'war machine' if it's all about

Red Flora, Rote Flora, Hamburg Germany. A whole anarchist neighborhood
and community center that's existed for years. Three years ago they
stood the government down, with assistance coming from all over Europe.
Second World War. Masked protesters torched cars and showered police
with stones, bottles and fireworks. The police responded with water
cannon, baton charges and tear gas. More than 120 police officers and an
estimated 500 demonstrators were injured, many of them badly.
Just days later, another group of protesters assaulted police with
stones and bottles as they were leaving the Davidwache station in what
was apparently an unprovoked attack."
Ps. Red Flora still stands. Unlike prog-lib protests and squats, because
there's a HUGE BASE OF SUPPORT in German society.
Spain too. It's not JUST Barcelona you know, or maybe you don't pay any
attention the the news from Spain but rely on Wikipedia entries to

COINTELPRO was the NYPD "Bureau of Special Services" aka Red Squad

campus and using the file cabinet/phonecall/whoknowswheretheygotitfrom

because they're a 16 year old antiwar protester.... Captain Finnegan's

photographing protesters and singling people out for 'special

about it's abuses. Right. Sure.
The group I was involved in ended up having three or four police agents,
informers, freelancing john birchers... including the group's

Peer Review is the main root of the ignorance I see in Academia. Modern
education in the US and much of Europe is not much more than
indoctrination, and peer-review enforces a situation where only vetted
indoctrinators may address the inquiring and malleable minds of young
people. Including inculcating such nonsense as 'patriotism' to a

Sociopolitical beliefs inculcated in those minds that make them conform

Not all. I named a couple of occupations that serve no useful purpose to

larger sense than torproject, is ioerror and folks like him (Stewart
Brand, not technically a coder but...). Not many  left now, and the end
result? Not much innovation. Just polishing apples that have been on the
shelf for years. flashier graphics, miniaturization, speed, but that's
kind of it. It all came to a screeching halt after streaming video blew
the marketing end of the internet wide open in a latter day "Gold Rush"
for marketers. It was inevitable. Just like TV went from information
tool to an entertainment medium, so went the intertubz for 99% of it's
users today.
People interested in money create money no matter what industry they're
in and the product is just the vehicle to do that. Money is a lousy sole
driving force for development and innovation.
If those guys were making the same wage as a bagboy at a grocery store
do you suppose they'd be coding? Coders used to make supermarket worker
wages, never complained, worked themselves to literal exhaustion and
burned their eyes out on Green-Black/Yellow-Black dot matrix monitors,

Not the money.

MIT Technology Review:
Scientists at the Computational Story Laboratory have analyzed novels to
identify the building blocks of all stories.
by Emerging Technology from the arXiv July 6, 2016
Back in 1995, Kurt Vonnegut gave a lecture in which he described his
theory about the shapes of stories. In the process, he plotted several
examples on a blackboard. “There is no reason why the simple shapes of
stories can’t be fed into computers,” he said. “They are beautiful
shapes.” The video is available on YouTube.
Vonnegut was representing in graphical form an idea that writers have
explored for centuries—that stories follow emotional arcs, that these
arcs can have different shapes, and that some shapes are better suited
to storytelling than others.
Vonnegut mapped out several arcs in his lecture. These include the
simple arc encapsulating “man falls into hole, man gets out of hole” and
the more complex one of “boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl.”
Vonnegut is not alone in attempting to categorize stories into types,
although he was probably the first to do it in graphical form. Aristotle
was at it over 2,000 years before him, and many others have followed in
his footsteps.
However, there is little agreement on the number of different emotional
arcs that arise in stories or their shape. Estimates vary from three
basic patterns to more than 30. But there is little in the way of
scientific evidence to favor one number over another.
Today (ed. Here in the future... -Rr), that changes thanks to the work
of Andrew Reagan at the Computational Story Lab at the University of
Vermont in Burlington and a few pals. These guys have used sentiment
analysis to map the emotional arcs of over 1,700 stories and then used
data-mining techniques to reveal the most common arcs. “We find a set of
six core trajectories which form the building blocks of complex
narratives,” they say.

When I was that age (late 1950s, NYC area) television was, not new, but
new as a common household 'appliance' everyone aspired to own. The
'lucky ones' had 'color' tvs that were absolutely awful by modern
standards but most people had B&W sets. When I watched TeeVee it was
with the rest of the family, like an outing, or going to a movie. There
was always an adult there to help me out with complex concepts (and
violence... "Racket Squad, The Untouchables, and Highway Patrol were
just as bloody as a modern war movie).
Later in their history teevees became babysitters with no adult
attending. It does make a difference to have an adult nearby watching
teevee with you if you're a child, and not just a chronological adult
which is what many are now days after being babysat by teevee until they
were terminally 'dumbed' and numbed.

Regarding the number of Jews killed. Every official authority including
Russian sources estimate the number of dead between 4-8 million.
There's a lot of variance because of HOW it's decided whether the deaths
were related to Nazi government action or not. It will NEVER be totally
settled, so most just uses the 6 million number.
As a more recent example there's dispute over the number of Iraqis
killed by the US for similar reasons. International law holds that the
invader is responsible for securing the invaded space and is responsible
for all deaths including civilian on civilian murder etc.
The US, ofc, doesn't buy that, or that they're responsible for the mass
fratricide they cause arming ethnic groups against each other for it's
own purposes. So the numbers will vary.
As a Jew, what I don't want to see are Jews denying there were/are
holocausts happening just as tragic every moment we're alive and for
some reason the Nazi holocaust was somehow worse than, lets say, what
the US did, is doing, to the indigenous people.
Many Jews think like that. Ours is the only Holocaust. As my Bessarabian
grandpa, chased across the region by the Bishkek pogroms of the late
1800s(?)  would have said "Ishkabibble". Yiddish slang for nonsense, and
the people pushing that POV on Jews HAVE an agenda, and funding for it
from Zionists who hope the international community will let them have
their way with Palestinians 'b/c holocaust'.

Big Data Isn’t Just Watching You—It’s Making You Poorer
Cathy O’Neil’s new book, Weapons of Math Destruction, shows mathematical
models aren’t free of ideology.
BY Pankaj Mehta, In These Times, Sept 6 2016
By some estimates, humanity now produces 2.5 quintillion bytes of data
every day—more than a hundred times the amount of data in the entire
Library of Congress. This data ranges from Facebook posts to
military-grade satellite photos. Increasingly, this data is analyzed by
complex mathematical models that determine more and more aspects of our
lives, from the advertisements we see to whether we have access to
private insurance. Yet despite their growing importance, these models
often remain hidden.
Advocates of such mathematical modeling, in both the public and private
sectors, portray it as a neutral and efficient alternative to fallible
and biased human decision-making. Mathematician, data scientist and
popular blogger Cathy O’Neil, author of Weapons of Math Destruction: How
Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy, doesn’t agree.
She argues that many mathematical models are ideological tools that
exacerbate oppression and inequality. Her examples range from the crime
models used by police departments to determine which neighborhoods to
patrol, to the recidivism models used by judges to hand out prison
O’Neil is passionate about exposing the harmful effects of Big
Data–driven mathematical models (what she calls WMDs), and she’s
uniquely qualified for the task. She earned a Ph.D. in math from Harvard
and landed a tenure-track at Barnard. But she became bored with the pace
and insularity of academia, and left to work as a quantitative analyst
at the hedge fund D.E. Shaw. There, she had a front-row seat for the
2008 financial crisis.
This experience fundamentally changed O’Neil’s relationship to
mathematics. She realized that far from being a neutral object of study,
mathematics was not only “deeply entangled in the world’s problems but
also fueling many of them.” People in power were “deliberately
[wielding] formulas to impress rather than clarify.” This
disillusionment led O’Neil to get involved with Occupy Wall Street and
start educating the public about the dangers of WMDs through her blog,
She is careful to point out that there is nothing inherently destructive
about mathematical modeling. Sophisticated data modeling enables much of
modern technology, from wireless communication to drug discovery. How
can one distinguish a destructive math model from an ordinary, or even
helpful, one? O’Neil identifies three key features of WMDs: lack of
transparency, lack of fairness and, most importantly, operation on a
massive scale.
O’Neil grounds her argument in case studies of WMDs in a variety of
settings: finance, higher education, the criminal justice system, online
advertising, employment decisions and scheduling, and credit and
insurance provision. The “value-added” model for teacher evaluation,
which looks at improvements in individual students’ test scores—a
favorite of the so-called “educational reform” movement—is touted as an
objective measure of a teacher’s worth. Yet this is far from the truth.
O’Neil cites an analysis by blogger and educator Gary Rubinstein of New
York’s 2010 value-added scores for public school teachers. O’Neil
explains that “Of teachers who taught the same subject in consecutive
years, one in four registered a 40-point difference. [This] suggests
that the evaluation data is practically random.” O’Neil argues that this
is because the value-added model, which relies on predictions of student
performance, suffers from a built-in logical flaw: No statistical model
can accurately make predictions about a class of 25 or 30 students—the
sample size is too small. Yet the high-stakes testing regime continues
to wreak havoc on the trajectories of students and teachers alike.
Other WMDs, known as e-scores, use data such as ZIP codes, web-surfing
patterns and recent purchases to evaluate a person’s credit-worthiness.
Unlike the more familiar FICO credit scores that are freely available
and regulated by the government, these secretive e-scores are
“unaccountable, unregulated and often unfair.” Whereas FICO scores are
based on your own financial history, e-scores compare you to other
people with similar profiles. This may seem benign, but it can result in
feedback loops that reinforce existing social inequities. If you live in
a poor ZIP code, then your e-score will drop, meaning less credit and
higher interest rates—essentially, an algorithmic redlining of the poor
and working class.

The power elite (and yes that includes her shill the 1/2-elite Donald
Trump) have chosen her to be president. She manipulates the levers of
power and war in exactly the manner maximizing the ROI on whatever their
particular interest are. They want it to stay just... like... that.
Further, the resources gained via (diplomatic) power and war are getting
scarce, and due to the need for wars to acquire them, are also quite
expensive . Factories across the planet operate on JIT inventories of
many of those materials (oil, other extractive resources up the supply
chain), and disruption of that flow, even momentarily, threatens their
ROI and has the potential to cause continued disruptions. They can't
allow that, and Hillary knows it, so if she wants to manipulate those
levers they might literally 'work her to death' just getting to the
'levers'. She IS an employee, and the bennies are world class, so she does.
There are people (no more interested in shutting the MACHINE down than
Clinton) who would oppose that plan for her leadership of the US and
they will pounce on every opportunity to weaken her chances. Including
the fact that she's an old lady and the grueling business of
campaigning, no less running the MACHINE might be beyond her physical
capacity. My grandmother passed in 1967 from complications of
Pneumonia.She was just a couple of years older than Clinton is today,
and was not in bad health... Had rarely been to doctors previously.

I'm going to say it again. Tor is barely passable if you're going to
risk your freedom or life. Throw cloudflare anywhere in that mix and
it's no longer even passable. I'd trust twitter DM before I'd trust
Cloudflare. At least they demand a court order and resist orders they
think are bogus. Cloudflare... HAve they ever publicly stated any info
regarding court orders? I'm not seeing it.
But you never know it until you're in prison or dead, and you'd STILL
never find out about it. In court discovery motions the prosecutor would
claim their source is DHS-affiliated and to name it would cause problems
catching terrorists or some other bullshit, and a judge WILL buy that.
Why not just let the DHS handle your tormail for you? That's what you're
doing, and yes I am ABSOLUTELY ragging on Cloudflare and the scumbucket

Whoever did this, U.S. says of latest hacks, we’re coming after you
With linkage @ Mcclatchy
By Tim Johnson
Top White House and Justice Department officials asked for patience from
the public Wednesday as they refused to say whether Russia or another
nation may be behind a new series of headline-grabbing hacks affecting
the realms of politics and sports.
But they promised that the hacks will not go unpunished – once they are
certain who is responsible for them.
“Whether you are a rogue hacker or a uniformed soldier, the shadowy
corners of the internet will not provide respite for long,” Attorney
General Loretta Lynch said.
A top Lynch deputy, John P. Carlin of the Justice Department’s National
Security Division, said the Obama administration would go after whoever
was responsible, even if they were operating as part of a foreign
government’s institutions.
“The message should be clear: You are not safe because you are operating
under another nation’s flag,” Carlin said. “We can figure out who did
it. It won’t remain anonymous.”
The warnings came as the interim chair of the Democratic National
Committee, Donna Brazile, blamed agents in Russia for the release of new
hacked DNC documents that she said were intended to influence the
outcome of November’s presidential election.
“There’s one person who stands to benefit from these criminal acts, and
that’s Donald Trump,” Brazile said in a statement. “Not only has Trump
embraced (Russian President Vladimir) Putin, he publicly encouraged
further Russian espionage to help his campaign.”
Whoever hacked the DNC, an act first reported in June, provided some
20,000 internal DNC emails to WikiLeaks, which released them a month
later. The hack has fueled concern that foreign cyber-agents might also
meddle directly in the November U.S. election.
Earlier this week, the World Anti-Doping Agency reported that its
database had been penetrated by a Russian espionage group, known as
Fancy Bear, that released information on four U.S. athletes – gymnast
Simone Biles, tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams, and basketball
player Elena Delle Donne. The confidential medical data showed that the
four had used medicines that usually are banned but that may be used
with approval from the International Olympic Committee to treat certain
medical conditions. All four had received permission.
Hundreds of Russian athletes were barred from competing in last month’s
Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro due to suspicions of widespread
Lisa O. Monaco, President Barack Obama’s top aide on homeland security
and counterterrorism, declined to blame Russia for the latest hacks but
said finger-pointing would come soon enough.
“Folks should stay tuned,” Monaco said at a forum at the Center for
Strategic & International Studies to honor the Justice Department’s
Division of National Security.
“We know Russia is a bad actor in cyberspace, just as China has been,
just as Iran has been,” Monaco said. “Nobody should think that there is
a free pass when you’re conducting malicious cyber-activity.”
“Our reach is long,” added Monaco, a former assistant attorney general.
“Sometimes it takes a long time to build a case but it doesn’t deter us
from pursuing it.”
Lynch noted that U.S. prosecutors in 2014 had charged five members of
China’s People’s Liberation Army with hacking U.S. companies to benefit
Chinese industry. Last year, prosecutors charged seven Iranians,
allegedly linked to the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, with
planning to hack U.S. banks and a New York State dam in an attempt to
disrupt its operation.
Before the indictments of the Chinese army members, Carlin said, few
thought the U.S. government would seriously go after hackers linked to
foreign governments.
“There was a period of time when folks said, ‘Cyber-espionage, Chinese
espionage, there’s nothing you can do about it. It’s too hard. They’re
going to be able to remain anonymous, and this is just the world we have
to accept as the status quo,’ ” Carlin said.
But he said indictments against foreign hackers had proved otherwise.
“For those who think that, be it Russia or any other country, that
there’s going to be a free pass, that we can’t figure out what they are
doing in cyber-enabled espionage, the message should be clear,” he said.

Ps. Leonard Peltier made a statement in support of the NODAPL folks
today and SPECIFICALLY WARNED about being spied on:
"I have to caution you young people to be careful, for you are up
against a very evil group of people whose only concern is to fill their
pockets with even more gold and wealth. They could not care less how
many of you they have to kill or bury in a prison cell. They don’t care
if you are a young child or an old grandmother, and you better believe
they are and have been recruiting our own people to be snitches and
traitors. They will look to the drunks, the addicts, and child
molesters, those who prey on our old and our children; they look for the
weak-minded individuals.
You must remember to be very cautious about falsely accusing people
based more on personal opinion than on evidence. Be smart."

The law of the land is you have to identify yourself. You don't have to
produce papers unless you're operating a vehicle. Even then you don't
have to produce, but you'll get a fixit ticket for not having it with you.
OTOH, things can be 'different you're POC, homeless or poor... For
instance a homeless friend of mine was given a camping ticket last
winter. In the process the officer asked for his ID.
He informed the cop it was buried away for the night but he knew his
*Identification Number*. The cop told him that wasn't good enough, to
give him his *social security number*. My friend explained that was a
violation of US federal law... The number is SPECIFICALLY forbidden from
being used as general identification and it said so right on the card
... and the cop wouldn't want him to commit a federal crime, now would he?
The cop then said something truly chilling that went something like this:
This is the middle of the winter in a town where it can go to freezing
in the early morning.
My friend complied, under duress, and he wrote that on the ticket too. A
ticket that never got filed.
Postlogue: I did a check for my friend and found that if you don't have
identification information for a non-jailable offense (ie. infractions
in California) the solution is simple. A thumb-print on the ticket to
simply prove you were there. Every cop has a print kit in their car.
My friend said he was going to sue for privacy violation but never did.
It ain't easy being broke and houseless and trying to file a state level
civil rights suit on your own. I suspect they wanted his social security
number for a database of local homeless.

Have you ever seen this bit In 1776, when the height of military technology was a musket and a
cannon, both of which you could make by melting down church bells, there
might have been something to it. When the contest was little more than
numbers of guns you could drag through the woods, and how to play the
weather, the government probably did need to worry a bit about
insurrection – and that might have kept them a bit more honest.
However, the first time someone tried that kind of thing, it didn't work
out so well. In fact, Shays' Rebellion just led to Constitutional tweaks
to make the federal government that much stronger. The Civil War led to
even more, with harsher consequences.
If 13 states, with the assistance of at least one superpower, didn't
manage to get their way through armed insurrection, what the hell makes

Lets say that Obama refuses to step down in 2016, and he not only
declares himself dictator-for-life, but he also starts dressing like
Ghadaffi, decrees that the national religion shall be Islam, the
national language will be Klingon, there will be an efficient rail
network in the United States, the writ of Prima Noctae is now in effect,
and there shall be martial law to enforce all of the above, as well as
any other laws that the President invents, on a daily basis.
We managed to preserve our right to keep military grade rifles and
machine guns, so we all muster down on the Town Common with our guns.
We tried voting.
We tried protesting.
This is a reasonable time to start with the armed insurrection stuff.
So, you, me, all our neighbors, hell our entire city builds a perimeter
around it. We fill sandbags, we all have ammunition, we all have food,
water, supplies, and most importantly, we are all unified and in
complete solidarity.
And we stand there, resisting whatever it is the government was going to
do to us.
And then they fly over with one jet, dropping one FAE bomb, and roll in
with three tanks, and in about 12 hours, our "resistance" is reduced to
a few smoking holes.
The Tree of Liberty will get its manure all right, but it will be the
manure that you shat out as you ran for cover, as long range artillery
rains down on our town, as we get carpet bombed from 35,000 feet, and as
the sky goes black with drones and cruise missiles.
We're screwed.
So… if the 2nd Amendment's "right to revolution" implication is real,
both practically and legally, it must also include a right to possess
tanks, jets, rocket launchers, etc.
Your puny AK-47 is useless. So, we need to have at least some of our
volunteer resistance show up with Stinger missiles, some anti-aircraft
batteries, maybe a submarine or two?
Oh, you can't afford that?
That's ok, we have some patriotic citizens who can.
The same billionaires who already own the government, that's who.
So what do they want to "resist?"
I could only see them wanting to resist checks on their own power.
So, if the Second Amendment implies a right to resist the government,
then that would mean that we need our billionaire friends to start
stockpiling these weapons now. We need a Koch brothers airfield with a
few fighters and bombers, and Adelson should have a fleet of tanks
somewhere, and I guess that George Soros would bring his collection of
nuke-armed submarines up to date, right?
So lets drop the crazy scenario of Obama-cum-Ghadaffi, and just think
about something we were really likely to see upset us. Do you think for
a moment that you, living in some apartment in Salt Lake City, or a
house in Wyoming, or a condo in Boca Raton, would be ready to go to war
with the Federal Government over the same shit that would get the Koch
Brothers to fuel up their private stock of A10 Warthogs? Really?
Because you know what the billionaires want the government to stop doing?
They want it to get out of the way of their becoming trillionaires.
If you think that the Second Amendment means what the Supreme Court said
in Heller, and you believe that is a good thing, because it gives you
the ability to resist the government, you might want to play out the
long game in your head.
The long game here is this interpretation leads to private armies,
raised by limitless wealth, all of which looks at our quaint little
republican form of government as nothing more than a paper justification
to have a flag waving over a few national parks."

anything to do with ideology,
There's an ideological difference between communism and capitalism.
Ideally communism should mean the elimination of greed as a driving
force in a society. Including greed for power.
However, as you described, the "American Revolution" was simply a
'transfer of pwnership of the levers of greed' from the Crown to rich
white men settlers by partially force, and partially the isolation from
Britain that made it simply too costly to pursue a full occupation, and
perhaps forced removal of their errant subjects.
If Britain wanted to, it could have sailed an armada into Boston Harbor
and leveled the whole city. They didn't. There's a whole bunch of other
things they could have done, including paying the Natives, whose toes
were being 'stepped on', to say the least, very well, to slaughter every
last guerrilla fighter hiding in the Green Mountains all the way up to

There ARE societies on the Earth today that DO NOT put the individual
first. Ofc NOT "Western Industrial Societies".
A while back, maybe 5 or ten years ago, I read a story about an
anthropologist working in an African village and he went and bought some
candy for the kids...
He, like a hyper-competitive westerner might do, made them race to a
tree for it. When the winner grabbed the boo-tay the child started
handing it out to the other kids.
When the anthropologist asked why he didn't keep it all the child had a
very simple reply.
"But how could I be happy if all my friends are sad?"
I don't think you're aware of how truly fucked up beyond all recognition
(spelled out intentionally) industrial societies are.
But you WOULD BE if bombs to get the oil and other resources to make the

Dimitry Orlov's blogger friend responds to "How (not) to Organize a
Community" with a post called "But what IS community".
This is Orlov's Forward:
"This is another guest post from Yevgeny, which he wrote in response to
my article How (not) to Organize a Community. He poses what, to a
Russian, seems an obvious question: “How (not) to organize a WHAT?” You
see, upon close examination the English word “community” turns out to be
all but meaningless..."
In the original piece he spells out in great detail how the outcasts of
a society build a stronger, more resilient one.
They're also likely to be marauders. That's the end result of
cooperative societies ejecting the non-cooperative members.
They band together like the psychopaths they are, and exact vengeance on
the ejecting community.
