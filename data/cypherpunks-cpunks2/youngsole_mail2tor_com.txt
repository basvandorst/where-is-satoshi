@_subject: Fuck Google 
Fuck every last one of them.
Mothafuck Google
They colonized the internet
Gave us free shit
We were the mothafuckin' product
Not cuz it's a monopoly
It's bigger than a country
Something like the modern version of the Dutch East India Trading company
They're like a drug dealer
Wanna give you some crack
Next thing you're hooked
They're selling more than your ass
Every Click
Everything you read
Everything you type
Terms of service
You didn't even read
It's not a search engine
Or an advertising agency
They put toys in a cell
Analyze you like a rat in a laboratory
I hate Facebook
I think it's the devil
But Google's a megalomaniac
On a whole 'nother level
They bought General Dynamics
And went big on robots
Fucking with Blackwater
Military Entertainment Complex
Then they bought Deep Mind
A sophisticated AI
Why these mothafuckaz need to do facial recognition in real time?
Whaddup with the Pentagon?
And the NSA?
We'll never know
That shit's classified
It don't take a super genius
To see the writing on the wall
They wanna rule the world
They colonized us all
'Do no evil' is your motto
Yet you didn't say Nathan
When them pigs in the sky
Turned y'all into a global data mining operation
Ray Kurzweil misses his daddy
He wanna bring him back
Google immortality
What kind of life is that?
Fuck off with your Google Plus
Ain't nobody want that shit
Hats off to y'all for removing that crap from my mothafuckin' search results
And Google Glass
Merging man with mech
Everything you see and feel
Is mined and sold and catered and pimped
A postmodern kingdom
You build as you breathe
Automate the labor
Let the humans be free
They built a new caste system
Humans at the bottom
The housing crash
A bad algorithm
Drones in the field
Who's responsible for war crimes?
The pilot or the president?
Or the programmer that created its mind?
They bought Nest Labs
And their "intelligent thermostats"
But it ain't about temperature
They wanna learn your behavior
In the wake of Occupy Oakland
They offered to build with the city
A trans-opticon that can link your license plate to your online identity
We ain't living like slaves
More like serfs at the tower
If corporations are people
No one man should have all that power
Self-driving cars
Google Play
They own seven billion in housing bonds
Three billion in public utilities
Look at Detroit
Now look at the world
You don't gotta be an astrophysicist to see it
Fuck Google
Mothafuck Google
