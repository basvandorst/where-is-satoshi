It's a dangerous view... so unless you're totally inoffensive, you have no right to privacy ?
Actual system think also about the same ...
Governments are not necessary at all if we consider a population where *each individual* can self-govern itself. So far you can't get x people, make them live together without conflicts, hate, jealousy, conspiracy etc... it's human nature.
Here the point I think would be more to protect oneself to be spied by governments rather than to spy on governments.
To be able to live - simply to live in freedom - without tracking, constraints, control, monitoring (not only from Gov but also from other people acting as if they were the Government)  is a terrible challenge nowadays. No need to go and try to hack the secrets of corporations.(which BTW have not so big secrets ...)
Possibly a new form of resistance will be to try to simply ... live in a world shaped by global video-monitoring, paranoia, fear, controls, distrust, etc...
Live without having to wear masks to get food or money. Live without having to make selfie of your ass to get a phone number. Life without the fear to get video-monitored by the iPhones of people in secret. Life without having to show your ID at anytime to anyone dressed in something looking as a uniform with insignia.
Yet it is claimed that a society without control would result in a large criminal world where several mafias would rule and you would fear to get wounded or killed at any corner of the street.
But 'Mafia' is also and before all a 'society' of control. Their controls are far more cruel than anyone can imagine.
All this isn't new, the "game changer" is technology which provide evil governments the way to make the planet as a giant 'supermax'.
Once again, this is probably where Cypherpunks, or others who still may have to come, may have a role to play as well... because this is all about technology (and the science behind)... one can fight against technology of controls (gps/sim/ai/pki/...)  only by using an equivalent - if not superior - technology in order to defat these technologies of control.

Survival defined precisely our essence, as Humans, because we are the
 very product of Survival.
If there was no need to survival, we wouldn't be Humans at all.
Which implies if, in our post-whatever-modern societies, there is no need for survival, there is no meaning at all to be Human.
Survival here indeed implies to survive to that giant and monstrous worldwide system which is been created in front or our eyes. Not destroying it, it's totally impossible, just escaping it or outliving it.

There's a territory where such things can be debated everyday in real conditions, it's the D.N.R (DPR in English).
In that territory, no such words as yours are used for nothing because they mean exactly what they mean.
Yes, vengeance - vendetta - against such Gov agents (funded and trained by the CIA),  as you described, is there every day and shared among most - if not all - of the population.
Frankly speaking, there's nothing romantic - as you could have expected - and just plain and endless Gore and Horror ( at least in the 'conflict' zones )  in such a way that it ended becoming almost comical.
I've never been in the USA (fortunately) but I am sure that the police and security forces there are extremely dangerous, over-weaponized, unpredictable and frankly speaking they seem to have 'a licence to kill' whoever they like (or more precisely whoever they dislike). I wouldn't want to go there because what happens if you are forced to fight such police ?
Whatever, there are no fights without an army - it's just called a massacre.

For Google, it's a good bargain... they collect new designs of processors for free and for them the fabrication cost (a few thousands $) is like a drop of water in the ocean.
This said I doubt this will be a massive production. First there are selective criteria. They will not build anything. It has to be relatively quality design so probably they'll only produce a few dozens per year.
Seriously a talented chip designer cannot find $2,000 to manufacture their own prototype?

@_subject: what should be the goals of an 'evolved" technological & scientific 
Question: what should be the goals of an 'evolved" technological & scientific society?
- buying and selling the most 'popular' keywords ?
- making super shiny HTML5 websites for the bags sold by Karshadian (whatever his the correct name I don't care)
- watching (mostly stupid) videos on small devices everywhere at any moment of the day
- ordering pizzas with a mobile device?
- securing the money of the ones who steal fortunes?
- making all people under strict surveillance, using all sort of monitoring devices?
- putting 'IoT' smart (sic) devices into the asses of old people to measure the frequencies of their farts ?
- etc...
Not really, an evolved society should try to seek new ways of interacting with the universe, seeking answers about their origins, building robots to serve and help them, researching more knowledge and maybe more wiseness.
And before all, travelling in space, exploring the solar system and their galaxy. Needless to say we are far from that and everyday we get seperated from that evolved society by millions of kms.
Our society is people-focused... democracy as they claim... each 'people' is a god' with a beautiful body that smells good and a younger skin, a unique and beautiful creature which deserve the right to dignity and above all, a brand new smartphone provided with plenty of super programs. There are 7 billions of beautiful asses on that planet, superbs, polished and clean who 'stays at home to be safe' but is that really what we should have expected from a really 'evolved' society ? Not at least a bit more ambitions than this?
Over all this, there should be a debate if digittal technology is really the most advanced thing we could do? We certainly need something like that but do we really need stuff like javascript which seems to consume the energy of so much young talents (sic). Computer are fascinating but so far all projects about 4th and 5th generations of computers were abandonned (the computers you dialog with, not program ) and since Android is becoming slowly but surely the OS of the future... I see this is a dead-end
there is surely a need for something else than digital technology but what ?

The very idea of cache is unsecure by nature... it's almost always functionally unnecessary unless we're talking of things like memoization etc...  but since you mention  a "media" app, I guess that's a cache for pictures, videos etc...
Good point is: if a media app wants to really focus on security should it use a caching system ?

I wouldn't call that a bug... caching is very,very error-prone and as I said inherently a security problem. In other area than computation, AI, etc...  caching is generally used for multimedia applications. I consider it as a stupid technique in such area. Sensitive things should never be cached...

Caching and decentralized content are 2 different things I guess
Well this is a mailing list of people who, more or less, are using technology and/or cryptographic science to ensure privacy for "anyone"...
In such a task, caching appears futile, unnecessary and an obvious risk. Therefore, better not to even considering it, that solves the issues.
I develop an embedded system for a secure communication station.
I want everything to stays transient, to be erased as soon and as fast as possible. I don't want that it is possible to scan the memory to intercept any variable, deciphered stuff etc...
In that communication station, communications can be eventually extremely scarce, internet very slow in extreme environments with all sort of modems involved.
Since this is a secure communication station, the last thing I want is to cache anything, simply because that is a secure system. The received data are stored in encrypted external components.

It's interesting that when people are in jail, the most common thought of their supporters is that writing letters will make them going out of jail...
Statistically speaking, most prisoners escaped jails by defeating the inner security of the prison by various ways (tunnels, disguise, etc...) and this usually involved a net of complicity (prison administration, drivers, helicopters, weapons etc...)
I'm afraid the same applies to Mr Assange ...

Also, how much would cost a ground station? How they would get access codes ? And How they would 'smuggle' and 'hide' such expensive ground stations This is totally absurd for a country like North Korea for instance. Also , again, There exists already many internet by satellite access, fully bidirectional so what that would change ?
Besides, since Iran and North Korea are under heavy embargo , I do not see how Starlink could be granted the right to provide internet to such territories. Control is easy ... The uplink of the ground station provides good satellite geolocation (DTO.DFO,...)
I would rather believe in a net of SW radio using data transmission (like PSK-31 and others) . Slow indeed but the ground sttaion can be realtively easily manufactured by engineers with local resources and that can be totally operated without governements.

I doubt that someone in a country - X - will be able to access Starlink without the usual 'KYC" procedures...
Will there be a single place of registration - online ? I doubt it. I think Starlink will have no right to provide access to citizens of country X unless going via registered/accredited national operator Y from country X, which will apply any existing restrictive policy from country X.
Starlink will never allow a "wild" access to internet by satellite to anyone in the world.
Starlink is brought to you by the same guy that brought the wonderful PayPal - the 'family' oriented electronic wallet.
Does PayPal allow "wild" international money transfers? Of course not, better using Western Union.
PayPal bends to any national regulation in terms of financial control and so it will be the same for Starlink,,,
NK may not be an example but many countries seem more to turn like NK than the opposite...
Creating a worldwide net using SW radio is possible but difficult. Need to build different radio systems and also to create efficient cryptography for them.
They will never allow to play "online video games" but they can be used for the transfer of documenttaion, books, transfer orders.... scanned piece of arts,
Musk said that StarLink / quote: "is “designed to run real-time, competitivevideo games,”
I'm not sure musk is aware that real-Time video games would imply such games runs inside an operating system which is provided with a real-time kernel, but the point is that
StarLink IS the TOY there :-)
Imagine a group of people having only limited resources, able to access factories to produce "basic" electronic components ... they can build SW ground stations. They cannot build a StarLink ground station and they cannot produce or event repair a 3D printer which may be even more complicated.
What is the model? USA shining like a sun and bringing its light to every far remote territory of earth?
I would rather see USA as a death star, bringing death and chaos to every corner of our planet.
A real alternative worldwide internet system should not be based on the possibility to 'smuggle" technology from the USA to other territories or to depend on a central commercial operator which will provide worldwide internet like it provided worldwide payments ... with PayPal...

I still think that if - for example - cypherpunks (or others) would like independent access to internet, they would need to use a technology that they understand from A to Z and more important that they can manufacture themselves.
Using internet by satellite would require the ability to manufacture satellites - which is not simple but doable and the ability to launch them in low orbit - which, with the technology of mini-launcher is also doable, while requiring a significant budget. Ground stations can also be manufactured... same story, hard to produce by small groups of people.
On the contrary Short-Waves based data communication do not require complicated digital processing and a ground station can be produced with relatively little equipment.
Ground stations can be mobile enough not to stay at same place, thus avoiding detection.
I am unsure anyway we would really need satellites to bring internet to the world, since internet is already everywhere, in my opinion, we may need such satellites for interplanetary communications.
We're in 2020, the world space fleet is populated with ... a few Soyuz based solely on USSR technology (not bad but clearly slightly limited by now) and one or two (not sure how much) Space-X Dragon... (+ all the secondary stuff: space probes,... )

I agree that there is hardly anything to expect from Musk. In the USA, one does not become such a powerful person without having strong political ties with the Gvnt and power in place.
Musk may have some dreams and some talent, I  agree on this but knowing the character and how he made money from payPal which is a real piece of shit, which was sold billions of $ to eBay - another mega piece of shit - I have few hopes anything can be achieved by Musk that could benefit 'mankind" in general.
Anything that would provide alternative communications to people on earth should be affordable and ran by people / organizations which are not greedy or corrupt (good luck to find any !) ... well maybe that will be created... actually I am part of a group which is trying to build a free Short-Wave radio network for data transmissions using cryptography, sort of 'survival internet'... without any Musk behind.
We really may need that to keep our human knowledge. Some may know the project library genesis ... it's an attempt to survive what may be a Barbary apocalypse, a dark numerical age with a worldwide power taking suddenly control of everything everywhere and sending us to High-Security jails for the rest of our lives.

@_subject: "unclean hands" -- Re: Fw: Re: Assange Superseding Indictment 
The "legal team" of Mr Assange, it is before everything a juicy business... for themselves...
'Law' is a parody there. A necessary comedy for that democratic circus. Well, they won't execute Mr Assange, they will make him slowly
and slowly die... to the extradition, then in the USA, then in a supermax, until the end, and he will be an example for the others who would like to try... just don't try...
Many things were wrong with Mr Assange, If you intend to be a spy, then you keep your profile a total secret, not showing and advertising yourself everywhere on TV.
If you intend to be a 'journalist' (and nothing really positive can be linked to that term) then it's a bad idea to act as a spy...
Finally, if you intend to create an 'open society' which is 'clean' and transparent and where everything is been known, that is exactly what the Soros-US-Democratic shit have promoted in Ukraine with the results of breaking the country in two...
If you mess with the US military secrets, expect reactions. In Russia, Assange would have been shot dead a long,long time ago for having done just a fraction of what he has done. Sometimes I think shot faster even  in 'democratic Ukraine', now after euromaidan.
Crimes of war are everywhere. War is awful. Regarding Donbass there are thousands and thousands of anonymous videos on youtube and elsewhere , similar to the 'Collateral Murders' which has produced by WikiLeaks... featuring horrible crimes , some fakes, some reals.
(and good luck to know which one are real and which one are fake)
So what do we learn from Wikileaks, that the USA are no better than the others 'non-democratic' countries? What a lesson!
There is just a conclusion... whatever one may think of Assange, he certainly doesn't deserve such a horrible fate because Assange didn't kill anyone, didn't steal anyone and didn't intend to cause harm to anyone - even not to the US Government apparently... and I do believe he is probably a very naive person.
What happens to Assange will happen to many others. Once you're in their supermax, it is hard to escape.
Again, all this is a question of action... legal team is bullshit. Totally bullshit.
There are ways of making people out of jail... all depends on risks, money and especially motivations.
What we see is the manifestation of a hidden (and hideous) power inside the 'democratic' countries. That power can only be fought by a group of people who are opposed to that power for ideological reasons. Once again, so far there are no ideology to unite...

My analysis is that there are 2 'Covid' viruses:
1) a 'strong' flu - a biological virus - which results from a combination of factors, I think mainly pollution.
2) a massive hysteria, collective paranoia and coordinated fear which is by far much more dangerous than the 'biological' virus. If our human society would be a network of machines, then that 'second Covid virus' would be a computer virus.
In 2) what is striking is the leading role of 'the police' and other similar fascist and coercive powers. People are getting beaten, fined, arrested ... or even killed because they dare to go in the street or refuse to wear a mask. Which mask is probably generally useless by the way ...  note the role of the media in the amplification of that fear: "That man went to a party and mocked Covid-19, now he's dead", just like if it was a punishment from god, at least from the god of Covid-19, like if Covid-9 was the punishment for our crimes and the mask the redemption, the police being the ministers of the 'cult'...
So what is hidden behind this madness? Nothing good? A collective madness... something sinister which is just starting.
Today we must get a mask to get food, tomorrow we will have to show our anus to get the same. This will never end.
It is a great crime than to refuse to sell food or healthcare to someone because that person 'does not wear a mask'.
Can we organize ourselves against that ? Creating groups? Again preppers are just the base, they lack 99% of what a structured parallel society would need to develop itself.

Russia is the last untouched territory, still resisting to the 'global' system which is now in control of the vast majority of the planet.
But despite what you may think, this has very few to do with 'modern Russians', it's a more historical consequence and the result of the past events ... still a "mass" is present there...
'Modern Russia' is vastly awful. A perfect example of social and cultural emptiness, mediocrity and vulgarity. To some extent even far worse than west ...
'Modern Russia' is one thing and 'what still could exist in Russia' is one other thing ...
Putin is a middleman, a compromise, a perfect example of modern 'Menshevik'. In other terms a hypocritical political personage whose goal is to keep the illusion alive ... bullshit army with super-weapons made of cheap Chinese parts and vintage songs (very badly interpreted what's more)
Until 1991, Marxism-Leninism was ruling in Russia (USSR) ... what they - the communists-  achieved and constructed is still there despite the ideology been (purposively) destroyed.
There is an intangible "mass" present there, a 'force field' still alive that the other 'mass' of the west is fearing...
But All this is now invisible to the common people. The official 'ideology' of Russia is to drink beer, vodka, get girls, go to the nearby mall and buy good products and show to others how rich (sic) you are (well... how good you stole everything 20 years ago)

I think this is fake news... the Queen never took position regarding the case of Assange ...
The british Queen has certainly many powers, as of 2020, but she cannot exercise any of them ..
What would save Assange now is money because with money you can (possibly) buy extraction teams.
Again, nothing else will save or free Assange... he is now on the way to extradition and then to court and then to supermax for the rest of his life, and they will make sure he stays alive but slowly becomes a zombie/vegetable.
As for 'political motives'... it's incorrect, these are 'imperial and ideological motives'. The man threatened (Digital) Rome and the (Digital) Power of Rome/Zeus/whatever must not be defied.
2,000 years ago a Christ was crucified and now in some ways Assange - which is to the contrary far from being without sins - is crucified by a similar power using different ways, hypocritical ways but probably even more horrible than crucifixion.
The mad queen of Roma/ Hillary (Il-a-rit) the great is personnaly behind this and that vicious lady(sic) will make sure he suffers and suffers a lot because a woman's cruelty can far exceed a man's cruelty.
As for the 'laws' and 'democracy' it's a necessary decorum which, again, is very juicy (how much money spent for Assange ?)
Actually there is one and only thing that can save Assange, without the risks of sending a military extradition team to Belmarsh.

That crisis is the result of the madness of the ruling class and demonstrate how they are afraid, fearing everything with the fantasy to live in a totally artificial world under control. Everything that they perceive as a threat to their lives (e.g. the virus ...) must be wiped and destroyed with great fire. That biological virus is a threat for the few, probably because of their inherent lack of (biological) immunity.
That global power is now based on fear. Using fear as a political and social instrument is indeed outrageous. Nothing can be achieved with the logic of fear.
Imagine a corpulent middle-aged woman shouting like a shrew, with extreme rage, and - in her ugly ignorance and fear - brandishing a broom in the air ... you'll get a picture of our modern societies and how and who control them... Shrews...

Using 'concepts' not 'news' is equivalent mark.

@_subject: ideology 
The problem is that 'bad' is a moral term which in itself has no meaning ... I read the Unabomber's manifesto.
I was striking about how many things, completely different by nature in themselves, are mixed up.
I don't want to elaborate on this in this post.
I started with the same approach that 'modern' digital technology is fundamentally bad, weird, insane and amoral by essence.
It doesn't mean that the Vatican is a more moral system but it means that somehow modern technology enslaves not only humanity but especially and before all men of science, progress and technology and turn them as obedient zealous workers.
As a former Maths teacher in Uni, I was striking how deep the level in logical reasoning in mathematics was low in students and has been replaced by some sort of 'collective' intelligence, pre-empting on their individual and 'natural' intelligences.
Kaczynski wanted peace, at least peace for his life but couldn't find it. He wanted to live alone, in the woods, far from Human contacts.
This goal, I could understand it.
yet as I understand he couldn't find such peace and was always interrupted and harassed ... even in the woods.
That harassment was the product of collective intelligence against an individual intelligence which was their target, their 'prey'.
kaczynski 'blow a fuse' (or did he? ) and started to send mini-bombs to several targets which resulted in serious injuries, often permanent and death.
What he did was in fact Anarchism fight in all its purity. He couldn't do a revolution, being alone and equipped with too few and too limited ideological material.
kaczynski while a mathematician refused to be a puppet and indeed he fought against a power who pre-empt on the brain of people and make them move as puppets. Now kaczynski is jailed for life in supermax...
Without ideology, kaczynski  is just a murderer and a dangerous psychopath but kaczynski had so much trouble to put together concepts that could shape a real ideology worth fighting, killing and ... dying for.
yes I think the mind of kaczynski reacted to what he understood and perceived as a terrible and extraordinary threat.
Grothendieck went in the mountains, a French village, decades ago and died there, he died only a few years ago.
A real mathematician like Grothendieck couldn't stand what was about to happen. He also said in his words "the devil destroys the deed of God at the speed of Light"...
Why The Devil? Why the speed of light?
Well this is just a small base... trump-fascism, war, Iraq... Putin is better than Trump BTW ?
They were originally very related. But as mathematics became more and more complex, philosophy had to take another path. Finally, political philosophy is maybe the more modern and alive form of philosophy today.

I did not say from supermax... so far he is not yet there
1) it is not you...
2) 'pay the price' is implying there is some sort of justice in the arrest of Assange and his 'trial'. Certainly you must be joking.
Whatever you do not like the man is another story but you should have a bit of honesty there and not pretending what happen against Assange is - even partly - the result of a legal process.
We can find volunteers here, also some Chechens.(note: one *always* find some Chechens, these guys like war and action like narcotics)
I'm not sure if it's a joke. Hardly there is PayPal there at first (recall it's family-orientated lol)... secondly making life less miserable for people in Donbass will happen the day they win over fascist Ukraine and especially they mega-powerful masters, e.g. the deep fascism in the USA and Europe.
As for a commando-style extraction of Assange, it is probably extraordinary risky, extraordinary costly but so far it may be the only way to save him from a terrible fate.
I still think there are one other way, without any sort of military or risky action. I'm of course not speaking of any 'legal' farce.
As for helicopter extraction, it works. There is a long history of such acts. As for Assange which is so high-profile, that is another story.

Well I guess Cypherpunks aren't necessarily trying to destroy governments, there are plenty of organizations doing that very well... especially their own secret services.
My understanding of Cypherpunks is - as per their Manifesto - that they are trying to build privacy in a world where privacy is becoming a crime.
I thought recently that the biggest 'weapon' against a fascism regime would be to create the inability for that fascist regime to track, locate, monitor and spy someone.
I walk in the street right now. Nobody knows who I am. My neighbor doesn't know my name. I rent a flat without any ID. Nobody knows my name. My SIM card isn't linked to any ID (true). My credit card isn't my own credit card but belongs to someone who doesn't know me really. I get paid in Bitcoins. I go to a local shop and get cash against BTC without showing any ID. My phone cannot track me because it hasn'\t a GPS and so on ...
I know that with the time that sort of life will be harder and harder. Hence I feel it is a noble task to build a system where people can live a normal life and stay anonymous - as they want.
Anything we want to do now, we must *prove* that we are not criminals, we must take pictures of ourselves, dancing in front of a webcam and so on... not for me.
Interesting enough soon there will be Quantum crypto, and maybe NSA has already it.
How long can we trust these good old programs such as PGP? RSA wouldn't last a long time against a quantum computer ...

I quote the main title of the article:
"Scientists in China managed to exchange a crypto key at a distance of over 1,000 kilometers"
How can they do that?

My understanding of cypherpunks is that they are/were a group of people trying to defeat evil things such as, indeed, Clearview and using their deep knowledge of cryptography to counter the use of digital technologies by a fascist power (imagine the Third Reich equipped with computers...)
Tracking/Controlling people isn't really knew but let us say there was always ... ways to escape... to find another land, another ID, where there was no question.
Think about the fictional character of Jean Valjean in "Les Misérables"(the book by Victor Hugo) ...
As a convict he wore a mark on the arm, identifying him and had his infamous condition as a former forcat noted in his passport. This doesn't prevented him to become a notable, a rich entrepreuneur named Monsieur Madeleine.
The action is at the beginning of the XIX century in Post-revolutionary France.
Now imagine the same man in ... 2020... an escaped forcat... how can he live?, how can he change his identity? How can he transfer funds? Anything he will do, any move he will make will be noticed, tracked, recorded. The law enforcement will look at him everywhere , in all possible databases and if he wants to have a new French passport "the hard way", he shall have to tamper protected memory and insert false the records inside a biometric passport, which is extremely difficult. Corruption and social enginering may not work any more and making fake French passport should involve deep knowledge of cryptography...
Who can do this? Only Cypherpunks.
It can be argued that only 'criminals' should care about changing their identity but if you are targeted by a fascist regime, getting a new ID is a question of life and death.
yet to my understanding, escaping and defeating the net which is building itself, making the world as a gigantic jail, should be the mission of cypherpunks, or to whatever organization that would succeed to them.
Imagine a real fascist power taking control of the entire planet , how much time they need to seek and destroy opponents or individuals listed as potential dangers? maybe just one hour...

Are nations really enslaved? Will these anonymity networks can really save anyone?
I'm personally not using Tor I don't trust in it and I'm sure it's completely controlled by all sort of governmental systems and under heavy monitoring in all cases.
But anyway as you described it, anything such an impenetrable communication framework that would be really dangerous for 'the actual system' (eg the big thing who decided all the sudden we all had to wear masks all over the world) would be known only by a small amount of people, that's obvious. Question remains how these people would get to know each others in a safe way ?

now for the 50% seriousity, I wonder how they can really use quantum entanglement at such a distance ... I am sceptical there and it would be marvelous if they really achieved what they claim they achieved... quantum entanglement over more than 1,000 km of distance... you flip a bit, it gets 'instantaneously' flipped on an other part of the world, located at 1,200 km distance, information without matter movement, at a speed (much) faster than light.
I got the explaination from Jim, still besides the obvious issues with the cables etc... such phenomenon as quantum entanglement relies on very complex experimentation and so I am not convinced at all that what they exchanged ( cryptohgraphic keys but in that context doesn't relaly matter ) was not used by "ordinary" communication, eg with matter displacement.

About the fascist farce and the "law of the masks" over the planet,
 this is like the "Reichstag Fire" technique... you put the virus somewhere (by accident or by malevolence) and you start to use it as a pretext to make the whole world submitting to your laws and you blame normal people for propagating the infection because they refuse to wear "the mask".
We live in a small community of 7 billion souls, all provided with a smartphone and driven by collective fears and psychoses.
That's hilarious to see all these idiots with their useless masks who think they're doing something great. If there was such a lethal virus, there would be piles of bodies in the streets everywhere by now.
It's just one more of these "mutating" viruses probably resulting from a combination of pollution, greed, malevolence, human experimentation and other similar manipulations.
And so what are we doing about that? Nothing... We let them imposing their pseudo-scientific laws with their limited knowledge of what really virus are...
By now many people start to understand that the Covid-19 isn't exactly a biological virus... more a virus in the mind itself... collective delusion and dementia.

Not sure if CHAZ is the Paris Commune or even could have any relation with it...
Anyway yes in general there is a need for a system which can provide news, information - and this could be shaped as a bulletin or a gazette.
In a way that its origin (e.g. authors, publication) could not be tampered with.
In my opinion of there would be a renewal of Cypherpunk movement, they would be more or less the sole consumer of their own technology.
Eg they would use the system to brodcast news to each others in such a way that news content cannot be altered and that the identity of the authors cannot be established.
PKI + internet is certainly not the answer to that. Blockchain + Ham Radio may be the right solution.
making robust crypto algos using non-digital technology is not easy but surprinsingly it's possible. Such crypto devices uses 'basic' components which can be manufactured outside China without too much problems.
So yes a blockchain using ham radio and crypto on non-digital devices may be a solution. No PGP here, no PKI - at least in the usual meaning.

@_subject: Fw: Re: Assange Superseding Indictment 
Assange is probably the most interesting subject in terms of Cypherpunk movement.
The paradox of Assange. While Cypherpunks are advocating privacy for the "ordinary people" (e.g. the John Does), Assange denied the right to
Governments to have as well privacy. This may look as a joke that governments should have as well privacy and not been open (and 'opened') but when you think about it,
there is that sentence from Nietzsche that says 'Wenn dulange in einenAbgrundblickst, blickt derAbgrundauch in dich hinein' , in other terms if you fight monsters, do not become one yourself and if you look deep into the abyss, the abyss also looks deep into you.
That say making lessons to the one who is rotting in jail is a bit too comfortable.
