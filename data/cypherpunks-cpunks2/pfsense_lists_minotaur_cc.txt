@_subject: [pfSense] Hardware requirements for gigabit wirespead 
Indeed, we have Ubiquiti kit running point to point links in the 5Ghz unlicensed spectrum (band C) over around 18km which deliver ~65Mbps throughput. I think our distance record is just shy of 68km.
Do check the 24Ghz spectrum rules carefully in your jurisdiction - certainly here in the UK the 24Ghz unlicensed spectrum is limited, and only allows fairly low power without a licence.
I'd add Motorola Orthogon kit to that list, based on some offshore experience with it a few years ago.
Kind regards,
