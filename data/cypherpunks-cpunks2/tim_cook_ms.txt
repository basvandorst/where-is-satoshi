So as I have asked previously, can you point to any working exploit of any
of the commercially available deduplication stacks?  None of them are
cryptographically secure.  All of them are used in extremely high value
targets including top secret government installations.  I would assume that
almost a decade on there is working code out there if the exploits are
anything beyond hypothetical.  While I applaud your diligence, it seems
beyond silly to me to hamstring people's options because you PERSONALLY
wouldn't want to use that as an option.  If I as a user understand and am
willing to accept the risks associated in exchange for something
approaching usable from a performance perspective, you're telling me I
shouldn't get that option because you are worried about a theoretical
exploit.  That's an awfully slippery slope to start heading down.  Where
does that stop?  Are you going to recommend BSD also stop supporting any
system that boots off of PCBIOS which has been proven to be exploitable in
the field?   Are we going to remove md5sum from BSD because that's
If you want to recommend they not have it as the default, great.  But
recommending it not be included at all because you don't feel comfortable
with it seems like a GREAT disservice to the community.  I thought this
horse had already been beaten to death but I guess not.
