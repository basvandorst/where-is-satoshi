ALERT: New CCOPS Poll -- your opinion needed
CCOPS:  Concerned Citizens Opposed to Police States has a new poll with the following question:
An Ohio man, a convicted child molester, has been sent to prison for seven years for writing fantasies of torturing children in his personal journal. By all accounts, these writings were repulsive. Should people be sent to prison for recording private thoughts in the privacy of their own home, when the activities described are illegal and/or violent, but there is no indication the person intended to act on them?
You can vote yes or no.
CCOPS has a new poll: "Thought Crime?"
Express your opinion, go to:
  and tell us YOUR opinion on this complex issue.
NOTE: This poll will be up for 10 days. Give your opinion now
and check back soon to view poll results and comments.
