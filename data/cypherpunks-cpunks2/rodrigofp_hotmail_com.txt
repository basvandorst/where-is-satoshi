Hello World.
How are you? I would like to share with you The Cipherpunk. A new digital library that brings together works by several authors. Some difficult to find, others not so much, but the main goal is to have everything in one place. To date, there are dozens of ebooks on anarcho-capitalism and crypto-coins. In the future, we intend to include works related to programming, digital security and artificial intelligence. In fact these future ebooks are already selected and stored, it remains only to add them to the site.
Users may also order other works in any language, as specified on the downloads page. We will look for the work requested and will let you know when it is available.
Moreover, we hope this is a useful tool. Thank you for your attention.
