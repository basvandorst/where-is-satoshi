Last name: Newman
Recorded as Newman in England and as Neumann, Neuemann, Nuemann,
Nyemann, and others, in Germany, Switzerland, and Austria, this notable
surname was of Germanic and Anglo-Saxon pre 7th century origins.
It was originally a pre-medieval nickname for somebody new to a
particular place. The derivation is from the word "neowe" with the
suffix "mann", meaning a friend or foreman.
The surname is widely recorded with Godwin Nieweman in the Pipe Rolls of
Oxfordshire, England in 1169, and in Germany Hermann Nyeman of Barth, in
1325, and the similar English version as in Robert le Nyman of Sussex in
1296. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that
of Stangrim Noueman. This was was dated 1166, in the Pipe Rolls of
Norfolk, during the reign of King Henry 111rd, known as the Builder of
Churches, 1154 - 1189.
Thomas Newman, aged fifteen, who left London on the ship "Plaine Joan"
bound for Virginia in May 1635, was among the earliest recorded settlers
in the new colonies of British America.
John Henry Newman (1801 - 1890), who was formally created cardinal of
St. George in Velabro in 1879. A member of the Oxford Movement, he
resigned his Anglican living, and joined the Roman Catholic Church in 1845.
A coat of arms granted to the Neumann family of Berlin has the blazon of
a red field charged with vertical cannon, surmounted by crossed swords
Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation.
In England this was sometimes known as the Poll Tax.

That is a myth.
Re-examining the "Out of Africa" Theory and the Origin of Europeoids
(Caucasoids) in Light of DNA Genealogy.  Seven thousand five hundred
fifty-six (7556) haplotypes of fourty-six (46) subclades in seventeen
(17) major haplogroups were considered, and the finding that the
Europeoid haplogroups did not descend from African haplogroups A or B is
suported by the fact that bearers of the Europeoid haplogroups, as well
as all non-African haplogroups, do not carry either SNPs M91, P97, M31,

"We" were.
Ancient Egyptian Pharaohs were mostly Greek, Persian, & Assyrian, i.e.,
Caucasian.  ~200yrs were Kushite & other Sub-saharan African Pharaohs.
If you think "Whitey" stole 'Rock and Roll' music from "Blacks", you
very well are.  It is a combination of Celtic and African Folk music,
cultures who were slaves together.
The possible origin of your name is crap ?
Have some fucking pride in yourself and your ancestral heritage.
