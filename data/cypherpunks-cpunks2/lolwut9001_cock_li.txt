@_subject: Troll Factory game teaches you how fake news is spread & why 
This is not the correct definition of "trolling". Trolling is a form of online pranking; it is starting arguments, derailing conversations, and making people angry for the troll's own amusement. What is simulated in that little game is more like paid political provocation, which is done for money or politics, but not for the person's own amusement.
There is nothing inherently wrong with the game itself, but they should change the name from "Troll Factory" to something else, and remove all references to "trolling" if they want to keep from looking like ignorant dolts.
We have here at Yle developed an online game Troll Factory that turns people into professional online trolls in order to help them learn about information wars. You can play the game here: TechCrunch just wrote about the game: This game uses troll tactics to teach critical thinking And: Feel free to share! And would love to hear your thoughts! -Jarno M.

Zenaan, while I don't appreciate all the Daily Stormer links that you're always leaving here, you managed to make me upset with this story.
I was on YouTube a lot during its early years (i.e. the 2000s), and it was like a beacon of freedom when compared to how it is now. I always think that the rampant censorship on the site cannot get any worse, now that things as commonplace as "insulting language" are against the site's rules, but every now and then (like today, with this article) I hear news of yet another way that censorship on YouTube has increased.
Apologies for rambling; I just have some very fond memories of the old, free YouTube, and it troubles me greatly whenever I learn that free speech on the site has been restricted yet again. (I don't care what Twitter, Facebook, and every other social media site does, but, please, leave YouTube be...)

I was reading it until about three-quarters from the end, when I encountered the paragraph with this sentence, at which point I lost interest. Do you really expect anyone to take seriously an article which uses the word "mansplaining" in a non-ironic manner? This is as bad as Zenaan posting stuff from the Daily Stormer...

Punk simply speaks his mind. His attitude is certainly combative, but I would say that, in this age of hysteria over such nonsense as "cyberbullying" and "online harassment" and "mean words transmitted over the Internet", his attitude is a long-overdue antidote.
I would not consider him a troll, unless you define "trolling" as "any unkind comment made over the Internet", which is not the correct definition of the term.
If you feel wronged by him, then take it up with him, and prove him wrong; don't make appeals to the rest of us.

[snip] Zenaan, I cannot believe you are supporting this. I sincerely hope that it is not simply because Trump is the one doing it.
I remember about a year ago that there were cries from the PC left to modify/repeal Section 230 because they were whining about such nonsense as too much "hate speech" or otherwise "offensive" speech on social media sites. Obviously they were against free speech, but now that Trump is against 230, are you and the rest of the right suddenly against, too?
Of course Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube have shown themselves to be pro-censorship over these past years, and I wish every day that they would simply ignore the screeching of the left-wing journalists and continue being open and robust forums for discussion. It is certainly bad that they censor, but it is even worse that government should now strip them of their 230 protections.
The best course of action is to boycott, or simply abandon, those platforms when they censor too much. Section 230 protects online free speech -- why else do you think the left made such a fuss about it a year ago?
