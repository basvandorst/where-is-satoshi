While I understand and share the sentiment, I'm beginning to wonder if
it might make sense to simply ask "why?", and keep asking that until
some straight answers emerge.
Because, as mothers everywhere ask "if some of your friends jumped off
a cliff, would that make it the right and smart thing to do, or merely
the popular and stupid thing?"

Certainly that's the current bias, but web  browser as platform isn't
really all that it's cracked up to be, IMHO - all browsers suck, and I
don't see them getting better any time soon, especially if they run
javascript and plugins.
Certainly better than public/commercial clouds - at least until proven
encryption becomes the norm.

At what point, and why, do you limit the number of candidates for
voting purposes? Why stop, e.g., at three? Why not 5 or 20? And do
these extra "winners" get a salary? Is the salary for the district
divided amongst the winners? Do any of them get assistants?
Seems rather complicated.
Instead, I propose a much simpler system: It's long past time to
vastly increase the number of Representatives, and limit them to 1
paid assistant. If we were to apportion House members as originally
conceived (something like 1 Representative per 100k eligible voters),
we're certainly have a lot more representative House (as it were),
with lots more members to vote for, and much smaller voting districts.
More efficient? Oh heaven forbid! But certainly more representative.
One could even add a number of fillips that you mentioned - move the
Capitol to, say, somewhere near the geographic center of the lower 48
(or even all 50, which I think might place it on a floating platform
off the West Coast - heh), or mandate that Congress assemble via
videoconference, in open halls to which their constituents have
access. But those are mostly icing on the cake.

vote Not Guilty - self defense.

At what point, and why, do you limit the number of candidates for
voting purposes? Why stop, e.g., at three? Why not 5 or 20? And do
these extra "winners" get a salary? Is the salary for the district
divided amongst the winners? Do any of them get assistants?
Seems rather complicated.
Instead, I propose a much simpler system: It's long past time to
vastly increase the number of Representatives, and limit them to 1
paid assistant. If we were to apportion House members as originally
conceived (something like 1 Representative per 100k eligible voters),
we're certainly have a lot more representative House (as it were),
with lots more members to vote for, and much smaller voting districts.
More efficient? Oh heaven forbid! But certainly more representative.
One could even add a number of fillips that you mentioned - move the
Capitol to, say, somewhere near the geographic center of the lower 48
(or even all 50, which I think might place it on a floating platform
off the West Coast - heh), or mandate that Congress assemble via
videoconference, in open halls to which their constituents have
access. But those are mostly icing on the cake.

Defense Lawyer:
     "Ladies and gentlemen of the jury - The defendant was in his vehicle,
     unarmed and surrounded by hostile actors, and someone started
     pounding on his vehicle. The defendant, believed that he was about
     to have his windows smashed and himself dragged out of the vehicle
     and beaten or even killed.
     "He panicked, and performed the only action he could come up with
     to save his skin - he advanced at a high rate of speed to clear the way.
     Unfortunately, someone died as a result. This is tragic, but he was clearly
     acting in self defense."

No freeman shall ever be debarred the use of arms.

Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed; as they are
in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot
enforce unjust laws by the sword; because the whole body of the people are
armed, and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that
can be, on any pretence, raised in the United States. A military force, at
the command of Congress, can execute no laws, but such as the people
perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power,
and jealousy will instantly inspire the inclination, to resist the
execution of a law which appears to them unjust and oppressive.
         ---Noah Webster, An Examination of the Leading Principles of the
Federal Constitution (Philadelphia 1787).
I particularly like the following:
*Who are the militia? Are they not ourselves? Is it feared, then, that we
shall turn our arms each man gainst his own bosom. Congress have no power
to disarm the militia. Their swords, and every other terrible implement of
the soldier, are the birthright of an American...[T]he unlimited power of
the sword is not in the hands of either the federal or state governments,
but, where I trust in God it will ever remain, in the hands of the people.
       ---Tenche Coxe, The Pennsylvania Gazette, Feb. 20, 1788.*

of the individual as unalienable and which consequently, no majority has a
right to deprive them of.

"principled and pragmatic solutions"
Pragmatic == no detectable principles
So, which is it - primciples or pragmatism?

Three quotes from a man of wisdom, which seem apropos here:
The danger is not that a particular class is unfit to govern. Every
class is unfit to govern. - Lord Acton
It is bad to be oppressed by a minority, but it is worse to be
oppressed by a majority. For there is a reserve of latent power in the
masses which, if it is called into play, the minority can seldom
resist. But from the absolute will of an entire people there is no
appeal, no redemption, no refuge but treason. - Lord Acton
There is no worse heresy than that the office sanctifies the holder of
it. - Lord Acton

Consider, if you will, a possible outcome of the current bio-crisis.
(I want it over, swiftly, and with as little damage to humanity as
possible, I really do, but it doesn't look promising at the moment)
We're seeing some congress critters self-quarantining. I think it
likely that more will do the same.
And yet, they (and some of you, even it not not so much me) want the
work of the Congress to continue.
How to resolve this?
One solution is teleconferencing. Votes, meetings, etc., could be
carried out this way, and work (such as it is) can get done. Think of
the transparency (if not voluntarily achieved, perhaps attained with
the help of some volunteer work by technologically sophisticated
persons of flexible morals).
If this goes on for a while, there's no reason why they (the
accumulated they of Congress and staff) wouldn't become acculturated
and accustomed to this new way.
At that point, what's to stop the congress critters and their remoras,
with suitable encouragement, to permanently relocate to their own
It would certainly make lobbying more difficult, being in view of
their constituents, rather than sequestered in the summer hellhole
that is DC.
I have a dream...

Uh, no, they're only not quarantining or taking other measures. That
is not the same as "trying to infect"
Some of your analysis is OK, but this statement is false. I don't hear
of government agents with spray bottles of viral concoctins chasing
down their subjects on the streets, or invading their homes, in order
to infect them.

The limits of an impoverished mind, I suppose, incapable of
differentiating between action and inaction.
Yes, a classical false dilemma.
Ever hear the phrase "Not my monkey, not my circus"? It applies here,
or at least it should. The point of government is to prevent crime,
not tragedy.
Too much government, not enough freedom. Pournelle's Iron Law of
Bureaucracy applies.
And I do think so.

I slightly misspoke - the mission of government is to prosecute crime,
not prevent it, because ultimately prevention is impossible.
But here we see the problem with your scope of government - everything
unfortunate becomes defined as a tragedy, and therefore legitimizes
all government intrusion into the private sphere.
War, that is, invasion by a foreign power, is a species of crime.
Illness is not.

You are preaching to the choir.
You suckers? You don't include yourself in the psyops game?
Again, preaching to the choir.
Focus, man, focus. Yes, biowarfare is real, and has been practiced by
governments and individuals. In this case, the evidence isn't there,
any more than was evidence in 1918.
Let's keep this on target. The US government, at least, did not, and
probably the Chinese did not either, absent better evidence,
deliberately create the virus or infect anyone. We can take lots of
issue with how it's been handled, but we've seen no evidence in this
case that the infection is deliberate. Nor do we see, at least in the
US (China is up for debate on this point), the government withholding
care. Poor planning and execution, yes, and Trump trying to downplay
it, yes, and Trump trying to keep proceedings secret, yes, but not
much else.
I don't know how old you are, but I've been studying and teaching
freedom for a long, long time. Don't teach grandpa to suck eggs.
