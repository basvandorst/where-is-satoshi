What kinds of laws are we talking about? I'm genuinely interested in laws
(particularly US federal) that may unwittingly end me up in jail if I were
to encounter an over-zealous prosecutor.
The book mentioned below seems to focus on something different, based on
this Amazon review:
"With such a provocative title, I expected a thorough list of ways that
ordinary citizens can be unwittingly trapped by federal law. Maybe a
handful of frightening anecdotes, maybe some telling historical analysis.
Instead, after two lengthy introductions, I find a dense chapter defending
... a Florida politician accused of corruption. And a Massachusetts
governor. And a Massachusetts House speaker. When I got to the chapter
defending Michael Milken I started skimming instead of reading.
Don't get me wrong: if those people were railroaded, then they deserved
better. But those aren't the sort of stories that excite people's sympathy.
I'd much rather hear about innocent doctors getting tried for prescribing
legal painkillers (which Silverglate does address, albeit later), or
citizens being sent away for behavior that nobody knew was illegal. When
Silverglate writes about one politician going after another, my blood
doesn't exactly boil at the injustice being done.
Silverglate writes with a didactic, passionate style. It's likely to
inflame the hearts of people who already care about civil liberties. But
for people who don't see expanding federal power as that big of a deal, a
sob story about how Ken Lay was strung up won't elicit any sympathy.
All of the above would make the book 4 stars. I'm giving it 3 stars because
it's a substandard Kindle edition. There's no table of contents. The
footnotes don't hyperlink to the end of the text (a feature in every other
footnoted book I've read on Kindle). And for a book that's been out nearly
a year, it's still far too expensive."

@_subject: True necessity of Records? [was: CryptoSeal] 
For the small Telco I work for, there are a few scenarios where we "give
up" information:
* Customer billing dispute, in which case we'll provide or confirm
information that a customer already has printed on their bill, perhaps in
more detail if available.
* Trap and trace. This is triggered by a customer entering a star
code on their POTS phone, which stores the caller information (even if the
caller attempted to block their information) of the last call only, on the
switch for later retrieval. That information is only provided to local law
enforcement, and they only ask for it when a customer files a police report
* We have provided CDR information to a court when subpoenaed. This was not
completely information, since we only store CDR records of calls which
cross tolls trunks (calls which leave our switch). Local on-switch calls are not
billable, so we don't bother to store them. I assume this is standard policy
for other small ILECs.
We have never negotiated what information we provide to local authorities,
and have never been encouraged or ordered to keep X number of days of data.
The same goes for the ISP (broadband) side of the house. We've been
subpoenaed for information about who used what IP and when. We keep syslog
data for up to two months, for our own trouble shooting use.

@_subject: [Cryptography] DSL modems - how would we detect wholesale 
Many DSL modems that I've evaluated are Linux based, and are subject to GPL
requests. I've gotten my hands on a build tarball from a couple of
different vendors which include a cross compiler, GPL source (for the
portion of the code which is not proprietary), compiled Linux kernel (which
contains proprietary drivers), and one or more proprietary binaries which,
from what I can tell, are primarily used to maintain the local
configuration. The result is a firmware which voids your warranty when
uploaded, but works.
Vendors often use the same firmware base, which is typically provided by
the chipset vendor (e.g. Broadcom). There were several modems I could break
root shell on with a shell escape sequence from the telnet/ssh menu.
None of this may be available if you're using an xBell branded modem (or
whoever your telco is). However, if you know a few details about your xDSL
connection (vpi/vci etc.), you could likely purchase your own modem, using
your own generated firmware.
Granted, there are still proprietary software components involved.
Generally xDSL connections do not use a high amount of upstream bandwidth,
unless you've got ADSL2+ Annex M or VDSL2 going on. Your modem, if you have
access, will report the up and down sync rate, which is consistent with the
rate reported by the DSLAM in my experience. To attempt to transmit data
outside of the DSL layer, using frequencies outside of the sync rate is
difficult, would involve cooperation from a lot of different vendors, and
would be a poor used of resources. Compromise of your data would more
likely be handled in software, at layer 3. Placing your modem in bridged
mode, with an open source router behind is a very good idea (as you

How Postfix handles grey listing, and how commercial providers throttle
emails is quite different. Postfix typically handles this responsibly by
returning a 4XX error to allow the sender to retry later. Commercial
providers will often silently accept email leaving the sender unaware.
Also, having a server's IP appear within on a blacklist is another problem
altogether, and is not affected by Postfix's grey listing configuration
(except for the case where it may prevent a server from showing up on a
Postfix can be configured to greylist based on certain criteria that could
be useful during an attack. Such an attack might be a sender guessing email
