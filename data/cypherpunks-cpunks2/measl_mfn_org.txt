Wrong lesson.  Windows was used, but was not necessary.  The lesson here is to reinforce the airgap with restrictions on who and how software and hardware is connected to critical systems.  No critical system should be connected to anything other than it's own closed system unless there is an absolutely unavoidable reason (such as code repair).  Where the system must be disturbed, nothing that connects to the protected system should be unexamined prior to connection, and the examination should be meticulously performed, by qualified personnel (and there should always be a lab-duplicate upon which all such events are dry-runned).

I understand your point, however, we aren't talking about just any old system, we are discussing the most critical parts of electronic infrastructure here.  When you've got a computer controlling fission, or power distribution {$your critical infrastructure of choice}, this is simply a Best Practice.  Hell, if we can do this for crap like public Internet carriers[1], why is it unreasonable to do this for actual critical systems?
[1] I have worked for or with several internet carriers who enforced this kind of security around their core systems: the smallest was a very small regional carrier, while the largest was a multinational NSP.  The only potential losses were dollars - painful but not necessarily fatal, or with any national security interest.  If a dipshit regional carrier can do this, a power company failing to do so is simply negligent.
And yes, I know that power companies are notoriously casual with their SCADA systems: it makes me crazy to think about it.

If I were the Fedz (and I'm not :-), I would *immediately* size the entire pot by declaring them to be "Proceeds from drug activity", and then let each donator go and try to prove otherwise.  This tactic is widely abused (despite the obviousness of it being patently unconstitutional, the SCOTUS has ruled otherwise on several cases: individual States, as well as the Fedz that came up with this idea of "Sieze first, "let the perps argue over it later - if they really want too".  Turns out that very few siezures are ever contested (imagine that!?!?!?), out of fear of being further persecution.  In fact, YT has a vast collection of examples in HD, where you can see the pigs in action: "I'm siezing that $200,000 as proceeds from a drug conspiracy. If you want to contest it, we'll arrest you for conspiracy to engage in the distribution of controlled substances, otherwise, you can just sign this handy little waiver form which says you are OK with this siezure, because the money isn't yours and you never saw it before, and if you sign it, we'll let you just walk away.".  Literal Highway Robbery.  Fed, SCOTUS, and usually, Population Approved. Both of these are great points which I hadn't thought of.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
In response to several off-list emails, I believe that the Millenials Amongst Us (tm) may have a slightly off-kilter view of "What are CP's"?
"cypherpunks are "doctors, lawyers, mathematicians, felons, druggies, anti-druggies, anarchists, libertarians, right-wing fanatics, left-wing fanatics, teachers, housewives, househusbands, students, cops and What I was [unsuccessfully] trying to point out to this Idjit was that the CP mailing list is *just* a mailing list: you have not joined "A Group", a "Political Party", or any other kind of organized "thing". You simply subscribed to a mailing list - that's it.
There is only *one* universal position, or philosophy if you will: CP is a bunch of otherwise unconnected and likely opposite people (cops/criminals. felons/druggies & right wingers/left wingers, etc), who share a central concern over privacy and privacy enabling tools.  Privacy is the ONLY thing that everyone here shares [in theory anyway]. There is NO GROUP.  There is NO LEADER. There is NO RIGHT or WRONG "WAY"!
Except for flat out trolling, there is ONLY one thing that binds all CP subscribers together: concern over privacy (digital or analog).  From that concern for privacy flows a desire to contribute: some people write code, some people host code (remailers, TOR exit nodes, etc), but we all *use* code created and/or nursed along here, whether you realize it or not, so contribute some brain cells ;-)  Play nice with others.  Or don't - doesn't really matter, right? Yes, that was rhetorical.
Grr... Got a little sidetracked there with the contribute some brain cells crap...  Back to the point I was poorly making in the middle of the night (on 2 days with no sleep, waaaay too much caffiene, and, and ...).
The *instant* you start believing that you have "joined a group" or some such nonsense, you'll find yourself in shackles: no bullshit, do your homework.  *                                                                         *

It would not be the first time an Agent of the Federal Oligarchy has posted something here hoping to get a reaction that could be [and was] prosecuted using whatever Law-Of-The-Day was available for stretching that day.  Look at my .sig. Go ahead - I'll wait till you get back.
Pretty tame, right?  Not so.  I got "An Interview [3]" for it. Seriously.  Don't fuck around unless you're willing to let them come for you. And they will: with delight and vengeance turned up to maximum.  They will break their own laws, if necessary, when they come for you ("Hi Dennis!"). They don't exactly get written up for bending a law into a shape that nobody - including your Jury - can recognize ("Hi Tom!"). If your jury can't recognize it they WILL do what's expected of them: Convict.
You will NOT get a fair trial, and you will NOT get a fair appeal, and nobody will get hurt except *you*.  So for fucks sake, be *careful*.  If you just can't be careful ("Hi ***"!), at least phrase it in such a way as to have Plausible Deniability[4].  If you can't control that either, at least avoid phrasing things in any way that would point at anyone else as a possible "co-conspirator": if you want to be a fuck up, you alone should be the recipient of your own lazyness.
Hrmmmm... I already claimed to have written the "last" paragraph, but I forgot something else: Don't write to people directly (I break this rule a lot for those of you getting ready to say "huh? He just said *what*?  Fuck me - we all have our issues), unless they specifically ask you to, or unless you have something to say that is truly private.  A lot of people will get *really* Bent Out Of Shape(tm) over this one: it will often break reply-chains, although some people get bent for no reason I can identify - they're just plain fucking crazy.  The Crazy Train makes very regular stops to both pickup and deliver to CPs. Get used to it ;-)

*despite* having 4 disqualifiers because she was the first and the "service" needed the positive PR of having  First Female Combat Pilot (in an ironic twist, she also gave them their much needed First Female Combat Pilot Death In Action).  She fucked up her carrier landing by stalling an engine (in a manner that EVRYONE had been warned about) on her failed landing attempt, resulting in an unstable aircraft[1] that had a previously known design flaw[2] becoming almost-but-not-quite-unflyable.
Then she finished herself off by trying to use her afterburner to do a go-round.  Her  ejected them when he realized she was trying to kill them, but his ejection and hers were not simultaneous: he got out still pointing over the hosrizon - unfortunately, she was pointed at the water when her ejection started .4sec after her  and she hit the water pretty hard. Probably *not* an open Casket for "Revlon" ;-) Hultgreen should *never* have been allowed to get a combat endorsement to her Crappy Pilots Association Air-Worthiness License. She killed *herself*

Actually, Revlon was merely a shitty pilot. Her orginal callsign was "Hulk", because she had almost superhuman strength and endurance (she belonged in a combat position with the Army, not the Air Force - she'd have been a perfect Infantrywoman).  She earned the "Revlon" moniker for applying heavy makeup prior to a USAF interview which was, ironically, touting her as the first woman to be rated for combat air missions.  Her crappy flying skills do demonstrate that *all* women are incapable of flying in combat, it proves only that *she* was incapable of flying (in or out of a) combat mission,
Agreed - when you A/A anyone into such a position where they are unsafe and unqualified, they die. It has nothing to do with gender, it has to do with being capable of doing the job (flying, shooting at others in the bushes in front of you, whatever).
This is a non-sensical statement because it is sitting on a broken foundation.  It defies the basic laws of the universe to make such an assumption (since it is not evidence based, it is actually just mere Bullshit.  The NYPD Academy started admitting women (ok, girls when they are just 18) in 1980 IIRC: the NYPD Academy *was* (it changed several years later after a *male* complained (and sued too I think) that it was "hazing" new recruits by treating them as hard in school has they would be tested on the streets of New York.  A court agreed, and *bam*, the "abusive" behaviour stopped. Personally, I didnt think it was abusive, I thought it was absolutely necessary to screen applicants who couldn't cut it in the real world.  Plenty of women graduated from "abusive" Academy classes in the intervening years, and many went on to be decent cops.  Some went on to be dripping bags of tears too: just like the "men".
Precisely.  She was not *qualified* to do the work for which they wanted positive publicity - she was unqualified because she was a shitty pilot, not because she was female.
Yes.  They should have waited for a more competent female pilot, and placed her in a position for which she was more qualified.  Maybe for the  seat???
"they" didnt have Earhardt do anything: she wanted to go, and she was likely fully qualified.  A lot of strangeness surrounded her loss, most of this strangeness appears to suggest she had a partial radio failure which stopped her ground support team from contacting her to bring her in in low visibility weather (no radars then, at lt least, not for planes.
Really?  I suspect the flight suits will remain as they are: built for the requirements of the pilot in the environment of a specific aircraft.  Why would they make the flight suits "girly"?  That makes no sense.
Oh My GAWD!!!!  Nooooo.... Say it aint so!    This is conjectural bullshit, and you are smart enough that you *should* know it*!
Depending on the definition of "male comraderie", maybe so.  Maybe it *needs* to change anyway?
Conjecture.  Now, if your problem is that you feel intimidated talking about your dick in front of a femal compatriot, that an issue for you and the air force headshinker.  Nobody is *required* to fly carrier planes today!  They don't want pilots who don't *want* [very badly] to fly carrier based craft, as these people will inevitibly fuck up at some point, killing the pilot, plane, and possibly others as well.  You have to volunteer *before* you can attempt to get rated for carrier based aviation.

Total, utter bullshit, and you KNOW that to be so!  Women were no allowed to even apply to a combat MOS until the 1990s!
Really? You have first hand personal knowledge that this is why she was chosen?  Proof that she wasnt chosen because she happened to be the first woman who asked for that MOS, and gave them a chance to prove their PC creds by agreeing to let her try and qualify?
No, you don't.  And neither do I: both of can speculate, nothing more.
Pure speculation.
For this claim there is a lot more evidence: PC was a factor in her death, since they certified her as a competent pilot on a plane she clearly could not fly.

Money == spech (recent SCOTUS explosion of pro corporate diareaha). bits (for email) may be private, or not, depending on whether they are "at rest" or "in motion", etc... There are an unknown number of permutations, which leads to the inevitable realization that everything must be protected from governmental decisions as to whether any subset of bits is "free" or forbidden, by making the meaningful only to the entities (persons or corps) that have an actual right to know: encrypt *everything*, and only let those who you want to have access be able to decrypt them.

Been examined at lenght, in detail, in the mid-90s.  Remember that things have value even if they are not tied to a money system: cpu cycles have a value which is relative to each user/cpu.  The idea of "charging" to read mail (as an antispam system), by reshifting the costs of delivering spam back to the sender through the tying up of the senders CPU cycles ("stamps") has been exhaustively examined. I would refer you to the Archive, but im not certain that any meaningful (pre-2003ish) archives still exist that would have all the mail from any 1 CDT, let alone all of Don't fixate on coin (money).  A common antispam measure is tarpitting (look it up), where known spammers are bogged down by resource depletion: unfortunately, theres no way at this point to superimpose stamping across the zillions of already installed SMTP systems (computers, printers, appliances, etc.).
As you think about this, make sure you look both macroscopically as well as microscopically.

I too have been giving this some thought: especially as not exposing list I think a two-way broadcast repeater is the answer:
broadcast repeater that knows the source, and sends to everyone else, after stipping any mailman specific things like tags, etc.  The down side to this kind of dumb repeater is in the case of outages - the repeater will not know (or would it? I need to look at this in postfix) what to I think the key is getting the incoming emails to the repeater *prior* to mailman intervention.

Ditto.  My sole advantage is I have free colo, and lots of extra hardware, with a n/c 100mbit connection.  As long as I don't have to spend money, I can support just about anything.
Oh yes!  I'm sure that toad is still swamped with incoming spam, especially after it started to be used as an attack vector in the mid 90s.
this *may* be an issue going forward, but I doubt it: only admins can open up mailman to attack vectors, and that may even be closed by now.  I've been running mailman since it came out, although I havent updated any of the installed bases in a few years (as fresh upgrades were always a nightmare under mailman).  Mailman is incredibly easy to install (once you get past the *awful* instructions and just figure it out!), and doesn't open itself to the many types of crazyness that majordomo did (not to say that majordomo wasnt a great platform for it's time - it was.  But traffic up until 95/96 wasn't that heavy either.  Another thing that will be nice about mailman vs majordomo is you won't get the situation where your posts come in from what appears to be different places: in the archives I noted that I had multiple posts under a half dozen "names", depending on the workstation I was sitting at when I hit send.  Majordomo made a LOT of assumtions which usually turned out to be wrong...
The repeater is the key.  I think it should be a stand alone piece of code, not a script, so that I can run it as any other service (or, *someone* can run it as a service!). There should be somekind of fallback for the repeater as well: if it goes down, the entire CDR shouldn't go with it.  Maybe a heartbeat system coupled with elections as to masters/backup slaves.  This kind of setup has DNS implications though: the TTL would need to be *very* low, and other repeaters who need to step up in case of outage need a mechanism to change the DNS for the repeater.

There are two possible approaches to dealing with white (& black) (1) The repeater is a dumb one, and doesn't care, each node on the CDR is free to implement their own local rules and white/blacklists;
(2) Any one whitelist is agreed to be valid for all nodes: as you point out, there will need to be some way to recognize that.
Option 1 is simple to implement, but I don't know if it's consistent with the goals of sharing information freely amongst CDR subscribers. Option 2 is, obviously, much harder to design.
\> I'm not totally in love with the master repeater scheme, though.
OK: if we want to design redundancy in all possible dimensions (above the threat model I believe, but still a good practice to have no single point of failure... We have a repeater on each CDR which, again, is elected every time an Elected Master Repeater refuses/fails to keep up with a heartbeat timer?

Yes, I could have beat it on appeal, but it would have been so costly as to make it unworthy of the effort since I was "sententenced" to an "SIS" - something that may just be a local thing (since I've not heard the term anywhere else), or maybe it was just coming into use at the time (~1985).

She fucked up her carrier landing by stalling an engine (in a manner that EVRYONE had been warned about) on her failed landing attempt, resulting in an unstable aircraft[1] that had a previously known design flaw[2] becoming almost-but-not-quite-unflyable.
Then she finished herself off by trying to use her afterburner to do a go-round.  Her  ejected them when he realized she was trying to kill them, but his ejection and hers were not simultaneous: he got out still pointing over the hosrizon - unfortunately, she was pointed at the water when her ejection started .4sec after her  and she hit the water pretty hard. Probably *not* an open Casket for "Revlon" ;-) Hultgreen should *never* have been allowed to get a combat endorsement to her Crappy Pilots Association Air-Worthiness License. She killed *herself*

Actually, Revlon was merely a shitty pilot. Her orginal callsign was "Hulk", because she had almost superhuman strength and endurance (she belonged in a combat position with the Army, not the Air Force - she'd have been a perfect Infantrywoman).  She earned the "Revlon" moniker for applying heavy makeup prior to a USAF interview which was, ironically, touting her as the first woman to be rated for combat air missions.  Her crappy flying skills do demonstrate that *all* women are incapable of flying in combat, it proves only that *she* was incapable of flying (in or out of a) combat mission,
Agreed - when you A/A anyone into such a position where they are unsafe and unqualified, they die. It has nothing to do with gender, it has to do with being capable of doing the job (flying, shooting at others in the bushes in front of you, whatever).
This is a non-sensical statement because it is sitting on a broken foundation.  It defies the basic laws of the universe to make such an assumption (since it is not evidence based, it is actually just mere Bullshit.  The NYPD Academy started admitting women (ok, girls when they are just 18) in 1980 IIRC: the NYPD Academy *was* (it changed several years later after a *male* complained (and sued too I think) that it was "hazing" new recruits by treating them as hard in school has they would be tested on the streets of New York.  A court agreed, and *bam*, the "abusive" behaviour stopped. Personally, I didnt think it was abusive, I thought it was absolutely necessary to screen applicants who couldn't cut it in the real world.  Plenty of women graduated from "abusive" Academy classes in the intervening years, and many went on to be decent cops.  Some went on to be dripping bags of tears too: just like the "men".
Precisely.  She was not *qualified* to do the work for which they wanted positive publicity - she was unqualified because she was a shitty pilot, not because she was female.
Yes.  They should have waited for a more competent female pilot, and placed her in a position for which she was more qualified.  Maybe for the  seat???
"they" didnt have Earhardt do anything: she wanted to go, and she was likely fully qualified.  A lot of strangeness surrounded her loss, most of this strangeness appears to suggest she had a partial radio failure which stopped her ground support team from contacting her to bring her in in low visibility weather (no radars then, at lt least, not for planes.
Really?  I suspect the flight suits will remain as they are: built for the requirements of the pilot in the environment of a specific aircraft.  Why would they make the flight suits "girly"?  That makes no sense.
Oh My GAWD!!!!  Nooooo.... Say it aint so!    This is conjectural bullshit, and you are smart enough that you *should* know it*!
Depending on the definition of "male comraderie", maybe so.  Maybe it *needs* to change anyway?
Conjecture.  Now, if your problem is that you feel intimidated talking about your dick in front of a femal compatriot, that an issue for you and the air force headshinker.  Nobody is *required* to fly carrier planes today!  They don't want pilots who don't *want* [very badly] to fly carrier based craft, as these people will inevitibly fuck up at some point, killing the pilot, plane, and possibly others as well.  You have to volunteer *before* you can attempt to get rated for carrier based aviation.

Total, utter bullshit, and you KNOW that to be so!  Women were no allowed to even apply to a combat MOS until the 1990s!
Really? You have first hand personal knowledge that this is why she was chosen?  Proof that she wasnt chosen because she happened to be the first woman who asked for that MOS, and gave them a chance to prove their PC creds by agreeing to let her try and qualify?
No, you don't.  And neither do I: both of can speculate, nothing more.
Pure speculation.
For this claim there is a lot more evidence: PC was a factor in her death, since they certified her as a competent pilot on a plane she clearly could not fly.

Money == spech (recent SCOTUS explosion of pro corporate diareaha). bits (for email) may be private, or not, depending on whether they are "at rest" or "in motion", etc... There are an unknown number of permutations, which leads to the inevitable realization that everything must be protected from governmental decisions as to whether any subset of bits is "free" or forbidden, by making the meaningful only to the entities (persons or corps) that have an actual right to know: encrypt *everything*, and only let those who you want to have access be able to decrypt them.

Been examined at lenght, in detail, in the mid-90s.  Remember that things have value even if they are not tied to a money system: cpu cycles have a value which is relative to each user/cpu.  The idea of "charging" to read mail (as an antispam system), by reshifting the costs of delivering spam back to the sender through the tying up of the senders CPU cycles ("stamps") has been exhaustively examined. I would refer you to the Archive, but im not certain that any meaningful (pre-2003ish) archives still exist that would have all the mail from any 1 CDT, let alone all of Don't fixate on coin (money).  A common antispam measure is tarpitting (look it up), where known spammers are bogged down by resource depletion: unfortunately, theres no way at this point to superimpose stamping across the zillions of already installed SMTP systems (computers, printers, appliances, etc.).
As you think about this, make sure you look both macroscopically as well as microscopically.

I too have been giving this some thought: especially as not exposing list I think a two-way broadcast repeater is the answer:
broadcast repeater that knows the source, and sends to everyone else, after stipping any mailman specific things like tags, etc.  The down side to this kind of dumb repeater is in the case of outages - the repeater will not know (or would it? I need to look at this in postfix) what to I think the key is getting the incoming emails to the repeater *prior* to mailman intervention.

Ditto.  My sole advantage is I have free colo, and lots of extra hardware, with a n/c 100mbit connection.  As long as I don't have to spend money, I can support just about anything.
Oh yes!  I'm sure that toad is still swamped with incoming spam, especially after it started to be used as an attack vector in the mid 90s.
this *may* be an issue going forward, but I doubt it: only admins can open up mailman to attack vectors, and that may even be closed by now.  I've been running mailman since it came out, although I havent updated any of the installed bases in a few years (as fresh upgrades were always a nightmare under mailman).  Mailman is incredibly easy to install (once you get past the *awful* instructions and just figure it out!), and doesn't open itself to the many types of crazyness that majordomo did (not to say that majordomo wasnt a great platform for it's time - it was.  But traffic up until 95/96 wasn't that heavy either.  Another thing that will be nice about mailman vs majordomo is you won't get the situation where your posts come in from what appears to be different places: in the archives I noted that I had multiple posts under a half dozen "names", depending on the workstation I was sitting at when I hit send.  Majordomo made a LOT of assumtions which usually turned out to be wrong...
The repeater is the key.  I think it should be a stand alone piece of code, not a script, so that I can run it as any other service (or, *someone* can run it as a service!). There should be somekind of fallback for the repeater as well: if it goes down, the entire CDR shouldn't go with it.  Maybe a heartbeat system coupled with elections as to masters/backup slaves.  This kind of setup has DNS implications though: the TTL would need to be *very* low, and other repeaters who need to step up in case of outage need a mechanism to change the DNS for the repeater.

There are two possible approaches to dealing with white (& black) (1) The repeater is a dumb one, and doesn't care, each node on the CDR is free to implement their own local rules and white/blacklists;
(2) Any one whitelist is agreed to be valid for all nodes: as you point out, there will need to be some way to recognize that.
Option 1 is simple to implement, but I don't know if it's consistent with the goals of sharing information freely amongst CDR subscribers. Option 2 is, obviously, much harder to design.
\> I'm not totally in love with the master repeater scheme, though.
OK: if we want to design redundancy in all possible dimensions (above the threat model I believe, but still a good practice to have no single point of failure... We have a repeater on each CDR which, again, is elected every time an Elected Master Repeater refuses/fails to keep up with a heartbeat timer?

Yes, I could have beat it on appeal, but it would have been so costly as to make it unworthy of the effort since I was "sententenced" to an "SIS" - something that may just be a local thing (since I've not heard the term anywhere else), or maybe it was just coming into use at the time (~1985).

She fucked up her carrier landing by stalling an engine (in a manner that EVRYONE had been warned about) on her failed landing attempt, resulting in an unstable aircraft[1] that had a previously known design flaw[2] becoming almost-but-not-quite-unflyable.
Then she finished herself off by trying to use her afterburner to do a go-round.  Her  ejected them when he realized she was trying to kill them, but his ejection and hers were not simultaneous: he got out still pointing over the hosrizon - unfortunately, she was pointed at the water when her ejection started .4sec after her  and she hit the water pretty hard. Probably *not* an open Casket for "Revlon" ;-) Hultgreen should *never* have been allowed to get a combat endorsement to her Crappy Pilots Association Air-Worthiness License. She killed *herself*

Actually, Revlon was merely a shitty pilot. Her orginal callsign was "Hulk", because she had almost superhuman strength and endurance (she belonged in a combat position with the Army, not the Air Force - she'd have been a perfect Infantrywoman).  She earned the "Revlon" moniker for applying heavy makeup prior to a USAF interview which was, ironically, touting her as the first woman to be rated for combat air missions.  Her crappy flying skills do demonstrate that *all* women are incapable of flying in combat, it proves only that *she* was incapable of flying (in or out of a) combat mission,
Agreed - when you A/A anyone into such a position where they are unsafe and unqualified, they die. It has nothing to do with gender, it has to do with being capable of doing the job (flying, shooting at others in the bushes in front of you, whatever).
This is a non-sensical statement because it is sitting on a broken foundation.  It defies the basic laws of the universe to make such an assumption (since it is not evidence based, it is actually just mere Bullshit.  The NYPD Academy started admitting women (ok, girls when they are just 18) in 1980 IIRC: the NYPD Academy *was* (it changed several years later after a *male* complained (and sued too I think) that it was "hazing" new recruits by treating them as hard in school has they would be tested on the streets of New York.  A court agreed, and *bam*, the "abusive" behaviour stopped. Personally, I didnt think it was abusive, I thought it was absolutely necessary to screen applicants who couldn't cut it in the real world.  Plenty of women graduated from "abusive" Academy classes in the intervening years, and many went on to be decent cops.  Some went on to be dripping bags of tears too: just like the "men".
Precisely.  She was not *qualified* to do the work for which they wanted positive publicity - she was unqualified because she was a shitty pilot, not because she was female.
Yes.  They should have waited for a more competent female pilot, and placed her in a position for which she was more qualified.  Maybe for the  seat???
"they" didnt have Earhardt do anything: she wanted to go, and she was likely fully qualified.  A lot of strangeness surrounded her loss, most of this strangeness appears to suggest she had a partial radio failure which stopped her ground support team from contacting her to bring her in in low visibility weather (no radars then, at lt least, not for planes.
Really?  I suspect the flight suits will remain as they are: built for the requirements of the pilot in the environment of a specific aircraft.  Why would they make the flight suits "girly"?  That makes no sense.
Oh My GAWD!!!!  Nooooo.... Say it aint so!    This is conjectural bullshit, and you are smart enough that you *should* know it*!
Depending on the definition of "male comraderie", maybe so.  Maybe it *needs* to change anyway?
Conjecture.  Now, if your problem is that you feel intimidated talking about your dick in front of a femal compatriot, that an issue for you and the air force headshinker.  Nobody is *required* to fly carrier planes today!  They don't want pilots who don't *want* [very badly] to fly carrier based craft, as these people will inevitibly fuck up at some point, killing the pilot, plane, and possibly others as well.  You have to volunteer *before* you can attempt to get rated for carrier based aviation.
Get a grip man!

Or that mere sexism prevented her from flying a plan that she was more than capable of flying: since neither of were there at the time, we will never know for sure - making this moronic line of discussion moot.
Total, utter bullshit, and you KNOW that to be so!  Women were no allowed to even apply to a combat MOS until the 1990s!
Really? You have first hand personal knowledge that this is why she was chosen?  Proof that she wasnt chosen because she happened to be the first woman who asked for that MOS, and gave them a chance to prove their PC creds by agreeing to let her try and qualify?
No, you don't.  And neither do I: both of can speculate, nothing more.
Pure speculation.
For this claim there is a lot more evidence: PC was a factor in her death, since they certified her as a competent pilot on a plane she clearly could not fly.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not arguing for PC: I loathe PC!  But it's just as bad as the mutually stupid universal declarations you are making.

Already litigated in the USA, with very strange results: for example, code printed on your T-Shirt is free speech, while the same code may be a munition if instantiated on a processor.  Money == spech (recent SCOTUS explosion of pro corporate diareaha). bits (for email) may be private, or not, depending on whether they are "at rest" or "in motion", etc... There are an unknown number of permutations, which leads to the inevitable realization that everything must be protected from governmental decisions as to whether any subset of bits is "free" or forbidden, by making the meaningful only to the entities (persons or corps) that have an actual right to know: encrypt *everything*, and only let those who you want to have access be able to decrypt them.

Very bad idea.  Allowing the entire planet know your financial contributions [trail] will lock you out of some employers, lose your job with still other employers, act as a basis for reputational destruction of future candidates inder the right [or wrong] conditions, etc.

Been examined at lenght, in detail, in the mid-90s.  Remember that things have value even if they are not tied to a money system: cpu cycles have a value which is relative to each user/cpu.  The idea of "charging" to read mail (as an antispam system), by reshifting the costs of delivering spam back to the sender through the tying up of the senders CPU cycles ("stamps") has been exhaustively examined. I would refer you to the Archive, but im not certain that any meaningful (pre-2003ish) archives still exist that would have all the mail from any 1 CDT, let alone all of Don't fixate on coin (money).  A common antispam measure is tarpitting (look it up), where known spammers are bogged down by resource depletion: unfortunately, theres no way at this point to superimpose stamping across the zillions of already installed SMTP systems (computers, printers, appliances, etc.).
As you think about this, make sure you look both macroscopically as well as microscopically.

Skeletal srchitechture discussion...
I too have been giving this some thought: especially as not exposing list I think a two-way broadcast repeater is the answer:
broadcast repeater that knows the source, and sends to everyone else, after stipping any mailman specific things like tags, etc.  The down side to this kind of dumb repeater is in the case of outages - the repeater will not know (or would it? I need to look at this in postfix) what to I think the key is getting the incoming emails to the repeater *prior* to mailman intervention.

Ditto.  My sole advantage is I have free colo, and lots of extra hardware, with a n/c 100mbit connection.  As long as I don't have to spend money, I can support just about anything.
Oh yes!  I'm sure that toad is still swamped with incoming spam, especially after it started to be used as an attack vector in the mid 90s.
this *may* be an issue going forward, but I doubt it: only admins can open up mailman to attack vectors, and that may even be closed by now.  I've been running mailman since it came out, although I havent updated any of the installed bases in a few years (as fresh upgrades were always a nightmare under mailman).  Mailman is incredibly easy to install (once you get past the *awful* instructions and just figure it out!), and doesn't open itself to the many types of crazyness that majordomo did (not to say that majordomo wasnt a great platform for it's time - it was.  But traffic up until 95/96 wasn't that heavy either.  Another thing that will be nice about mailman vs majordomo is you won't get the situation where your posts come in from what appears to be different places: in the archives I noted that I had multiple posts under a half dozen "names", depending on the workstation I was sitting at when I hit send.  Majordomo made a LOT of assumtions which usually turned out to be wrong...
The repeater is the key.  I think it should be a stand alone piece of code, not a script, so that I can run it as any other service (or, *someone* can run it as a service!). There should be somekind of fallback for the repeater as well: if it goes down, the entire CDR shouldn't go with it.  Maybe a heartbeat system coupled with elections as to masters/backup slaves.  This kind of setup has DNS implications though: the TTL would need to be *very* low, and other repeaters who need to step up in case of outage need a mechanism to change the DNS for the repeater.

There are two possible approaches to dealing with white (& black) (1) The repeater is a dumb one, and doesn't care, each node on the CDR is free to implement their own local rules and white/blacklists;
(2) Any one whitelist is agreed to be valid for all nodes: as you point out, there will need to be some way to recognize that.
Option 1 is simple to implement, but I don't know if it's consistent with the goals of sharing information freely amongst CDR subscribers. Option 2 is, obviously, much harder to design.
\> I'm not totally in love with the master repeater scheme, though.
OK: if we want to design redundancy in all possible dimensions (above the threat model I believe, but still a good practice to have no single point of failure... We have a repeater on each CDR which, again, is elected every time an Elected Master Repeater refuses/fails to keep up with a heartbeat timer?

Thats going to be strictly up the node owners.

The constitution speaks of ex-post facto LAW, not aquittal law nor indictment law.  That aside, I was personally found guilty of breaking a law that was not on the books at the time I was supposed to have committed the "crime", although it *was* on the books by the time I went to trial.  Yes, I could have beat it on appeal, but it would have been so costly as to make it unworthy of the effort since I was "sententenced" to an "SIS" - something that may just be a local thing (since I've not heard the term anywhere else), or maybe it was just coming into use at the time (~1985).  "SIS" ("Suspended Imposition of Sentence") - pay the fine, and don't get rearrested in the following six months, and the arrest, charge, and "conviction" gets vacated and "expunged"[1].
[1] "Expunged" it turns out is not used in the standard English way we all assume it is: the incident shows up as a "sealed criminal record", which can be (and has on more than one occasion since then) opened during any subsequent criminal proceeding and used against you for "showing a pattern of criminal behaviour" as well as for sentencing "points". "Expunged" my ass!  Had this been explained to me by my so-called lawyer, I would have gone ahead with the [outrageously expensive] appeal of my $1,500 fine.

Assuming all of your arguments to be correct (which I don't), I would want to remove "freedom of speech" for corporations because it artificially amplifies the voice of the corporate entity: the individuals who own the issued shares of the corporation already have these freedoms - by allowing the corporation "to speak", these "people" (both natural and atificial) are given more than their one individual opinions, (b) the corporation can be used to nullify the voices of the [natural] People comprising the corporation, and (c) the corporation has a narrow interest - making more money - which is often (if not always) at odds with those of the natural people who comprise the corporation.  Corporations don't need food to eat, water to drink, and shelter to live: the People for which the Country acts as a home have interests that are at odds with the corporate focus on
