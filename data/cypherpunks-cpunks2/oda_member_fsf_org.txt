@_subject: gmail usage 
99% of my email massages go/come to/from a gmail account, so it's
useless to spend time setting up my own mail server.
There are several ways to send sensitive information (actually I don't
think email is one of them). I'm using hubzilla (former redmatrix) for
a few years now, you should give a try.
