I'm having trouble finding the list archives going back into the 90's;
they're not on cpunks.org. Anyone got them?

@_subject: Home-made communications and security technology 
Given the enormous complexity of modern technology (100+ KLOC software
1+ billion transistor CPUs, etc.) I view security failures to be an
inevitability: the attack surface is rich for exploitation by enemies,
and bugs and errors constantly emerge due to both man and machine.
That said, I do not think it unwise to consider it a prerequisite for
the most paranoid-level technologies that they be easily understandable
and scrutinisable by individual people. Hence, I have an interest in
pen-and-paper ciphers, simple wireless communications systems for Morse,
voice, and data, and simple computers.
Is this something other people think is a sensible or important line of
inquiry? Do these technologies and the people using them exist? Are
there movements advocating this approach? Thank you.

Except that packets will be dropped if they look like they're coming
from somewhere they shouldn't: I would, instead of taking the IP spoofing approach, I would have
designed the network with the intention of making it appear that a
message could be destined for anyone using public key encryption: if A
sends a message to B and B can't decrypt it, it wasn't intended for B,
so it gets forwarded to other nodes in the network. Traffic analysis is
defeated by layering encryption and constantly sending lots of flak:
nonsense messages. If you can maintain the throughput at each node as a
constant and make one message look different between entering and
exiting a node, I believe it would be theoretically impossible to
conduct traffic analysis.
