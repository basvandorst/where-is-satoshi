Before a girl turns into a prostitute, with the exception of countries like Haiti and Democratic Republic of Congo, she can try and do other things rather than sell her body. Even in the third world, there's plenty of shopping centers, laundry and cleaning works they can try.
It pays less, but it also doesn't violate anyone's bodies. Most prostitutes had a choice at least once.

"Matthew Prince, Lee Holloway, and Michelle Zatlyn created CloudFlare in 2009.[1][2] They previously worked on Project Honey Pot." - "[...] the project organizers also help various law enforcement agencies combat private and commercial unsolicited bulk mailing offenses and overall work to help reduce the amount of spam being sent [...]" - That's just for starters, you can dig more and find more. It is interesting that the history of the founders themselves is no longer exhibited in cloudflare.com website as it was years ago.
As an American company, there is nothing preventing Cloudflare from receiving NSLs and having to shut up about them. What use is a system that you can't trust like this?
You can say "oh, but they go after the bad guys, spammers". But that doesn't limit it to spammers neither do we know who are the so called bad guys, since that is decided by American secret laws, made by secret courts, that issue secret orders.
No trust to American companies, less even trust to American companies that promise any kind of data security. Better no security than a false sense of it.

This article makes an interesting point, we got to dig a bit more from our pockets:
The second point I wish to make is the surprise by which the original developer took the issue. Maybe, just maybe, he did not create that flaw at all.
It could have been inserted into the OpenSSL repository through a backdoor ... or why would the spies by so interested in hacking professors that deal with crypto and whose word is trusted by the masses? Like they did to a Belgian cryptographer? Was that fellow nerd a turrist of sorts?
It may be possible that Segelmann did his job correctly, that the reviewer did his job correctly, but someone unknown may have changed it just a little bit before delivery.
Besides funding projects like OpenSSL better, we should start considering the security of the repositories themselves.
What ya fellow coders think?

Right, it is highly unlikely but not impossible, maybe the devs have copies and are digging through it. Which also won't exclude that Segelmann's PC itself was hacked in and the code modified after he e-mailed someone about having his job concluded and was delivering the goods.
Considering that the tinfoilers were right all along during an entire decade, I'm also on the fence with this.

Too many bugs, in too many convenient places. One or two may be a coincidence, several of them like it appears to be the case, is not. We know who did it and now even if it is a coincidence, the culprit will be pointed at the NSA.
The timing the code was included in the tree cannot be a coincidence. There's one more thing we have to look at. When nobody is paying attention, someone is trying to sneak bad code.

It is not that your idea didn't "stick" but we have a different problem today than two centuries ago when patents were invented.
Patents were invented when people were very ignorant and simple things like boiling cucumbers inside a tightly sealed glass was an innovation that changed the world. Basically anything at that time was something simple yet important enough to warrant a patent.
Until the beginning of the 20th century.
Now as you pointed out, it is not a matter of creating something nobody knows about. All problems are solvable, it is just a matter of someone putting their hands into it.
Big things that would be patentable today, which are not obvious to anyone would be things like Star Wars hovering vehicles, light sabers, etc.
One patentable thing is from a guy that made a new kind of cellphone antenna that tracks the devices and sends individual beams to each device using less power and being much faster, you may have heard about it. That's something which is not easy and cannot be easily done with current technology.
How many times in a year do you hear about such inventions?
But like in ancient times, such wild ideas come out only every once in a while. That wouldn't keep the patent offices, lawyers, attorneys, engineers and all those that orbit around it occupied and pockets filled.
It looks like we ought to find other jobs for such people, otherwise they will fight tooth and nail to continue having every insignificant little invention patentable.

A few years ago, I was studying timezones to link them to geolocation databases and get an approximation of the correct timezone customers would be using a certain service, that was to be used to sync clocks and plan backups for low traffic hours.
If you had the displeasure of doing this kind of job once, you are certain to get hit by the fact that politicians make a point of messing with time standards just to meet "political goals", like bosses that change desks' places just to make the office "more like their style", like dogs pissing on lampposts.
That is kind of primitive monkey behavior, I think many of you share this feeling.
I find such stupid capricious behavior is not worthy of respect and the people who do it, not worthy of their positions. There is no way of respecting any of them, since they are no better than dogs, by acting that way. It is bad when a boss does it, but it is much worse when a politician does such things.
Sharing my frustration, a guy in a forum said these wise words, more or less:
- 300 years ago we got rid of the influence of religion, so humanity could advance. Now the time for the politicians is up.
The current stage of the internet crypto is the same as the current stage of NASA going to Mars. We won't even get to low Earth orbit if we don't shed the weight of so many stakeholders - not to call them parasites so directly.
Either we get back to the roots and do nimble and usable things - that a human can understand and manage alone - or we won't go anywhere.

One could argue that laws which punish hacking as a higher offense than rape is a byproduct of stupid politicians scared by technology which they don't have any understanding of.
As an instance, there are countries in which probing a systems' vulnerabilities gives you jail time, you doing a port scan is a criminal offense depending on your citizenship.
This arks back to my argument that politics is nowadays nothing more than religion was a few centuries ago. There was a time priests would throw holy water against locomotives because them howling machines were surely hiding some kind of devil in their bellies. Politicians not understanding what technology is about, just throw all the police they can at it.

Yeah, they aren't auto-updating extensions, but this doesn't concern other extensions, this concerns the core of the browser itself.
These reactions plus the way we see this "innovation" pushed in the specialized media already is a sure indicator that the backdoor is in place already to trap the fools.

I can't answer to all your concerns separately as it seems you have got one very big problem: you are into computers, but you have trouble compiling - merely compiling - programs for OpenBSD.
You are in the same boat of Karpeles and Ulbricht, they also were barely able to code some interpreted language and they were overwhelmed by the intricacies of the systems they were building. Until they finally brought disaster for themselves and everyone that depended on them.
In order to grasp the seriousness of things, you gotta start with something simpler which doesn't require so many security skills, like games. Then you build up your knowledge until one day you can make your own exchange.
But until that point, it is irresponsible to try as you have well noticed.
Regarding the rest of your concerns, everything can be dealt with properly, but it takes years of learning. There's a reason computer security professionals are amongst the most well paid employees which big corporations and rich governments only can hire.

Many people think that if Facebook and Wikipedia use PHP, then PHP may be secure enough to work with money. Meanwhile raw money provides a much bigger bounty than hacking Facebook or Wikipedia, which probably have security holes in numbers that are orders of magnitude more than any small Bitcoin exchange.
That's why properly coded C and Cobol are used by most financial institutions, yes Cobol, as incredible is it may seem, it powers most financial transactions behind fancy web browsers.
Because even if a banking system is simpler than a Wikipedia, its security will be tried many, many, many more times than Wikipedia. While a hack into Wikipedia is something to be concerned about, it won't destroy it, while taking all the money away will destroy a business.
When I referred to games, I was referring to simpler and non-serious systems that people will try to hack in for fun. If you build such system, any system, that's training for some serious stuff in the future.
Ulbricht only knew some PHP coding and looked for help in order to create more advanced stuff, worse yet he had his servers discovered and mirrored and probably exploited before he would even notice it.
How can one be so low in their opsec that he doesn't ship a server for colocation with its USB ports desoldered and plied away? Or at least disabled in the firmware?
All your concerns are valid, meanwhile think about how you could work around every single one of them and note them down. Then once in a while you review your list, until you have solved most theoretical issues.
Then you build a non-serious system and offer bounties for finding exploits and people will find them, because you will never manage to plug all holes and the invader has just to find one hole open.

E-mail not allowing one to make his ego appreciated and envied in a structured nicely formatted page maybe?
Can you recode outlook, eudora and other closed source stuff people use(d) for e-mail handling for business? No? Well, that answers why it is hard to remove.
Little proprietary walled gardens are absolutely not the answer for this problem.
The gateway idea is interesting, but it has to be efficient enough and low cost enough for people to switch over. Something like bitmessage is not.
I think that answers your concern about SMTP transport in the clear, in less than one year the darkest bar in that chart will be close to 100%. If 80% of hosts demand strict encrypted transport, it will force the other 20% to change. Considering the snowden revelations and the fact that one year ago we barely used encrypted transport, having 1/4 already and accelerating is a good prospect.

There is no way to hide metadata because you need a destination for your messages to arrive, you can't hide it even in Bitcoin, Tor or any other network which has to find its destinations to deliver its contents. The best you can do is cloak it, but like any cover there are means to uncover it.
What is Iran? What is Cuba? What is China? What is Switzerland?
Here is your problem, you hold a belief, I hold knowledge. That's the little difference between us. It is not possible to have fast p2p unless:
- Cable networks collaborate by increasing bandwidth 7 to 8 times the current levels without increasing costs. That was done Brazil and South Korea which now have much better internet than the US. But the US still rule as the biggest market;
- People accept a more bumpy internet experience;
The first thing people complained about Tor was that they couldn't run bittorrents with it and they couldn't see youtube.
I would it too, of course. But in order to make it work we have to dial back the complexity of our pages and our want for high definition videos.
It is not interesting to merely have an e-mail substitute, because instead of e-mail metadata spies will request our google search and navigation history. You will certainly send links and those tell a lot about what we are talking about.

If you come from a poorly defended country, like say Saudi Arabia, they will snatch you out to guantanamo.
This kind of problem should be tackled by some honest idealists from either China, Russia, Brazil, India or other big country (Indonesia or Malaysia?) that doesn't extradite and would cause an enormous stink if one of their citizens was taken away to be tortured. If that country would not effectively attack the US in some very painful way.

Would you be in favor of charging someone for possessing things like:

Things like that remember me that google once did not have the capacity to exclude links from its systems, but because of pedophiles, they finally built that capacity. The next day the copyright industry was knocking at their door to take down content they previously couldn't because of the lack of technical capacity.
"Now Google don't have excuses." - I remember seeing that phrase in a New York magazine.
The only way to not have people charged because of a book would be to make legal all books no matter what and you guessed it right, it won't happen.

Haven't you thought about maybe, just maybe, someone that doesn't like truecrypt because it got in the way of their investigations too many times, put the effort to hack sourceforge to then hijack truecrypt and other "undesirable" projects?

If anybody has got the sources for version 7.1, he could post it to make a fork and continue developing. Given the number of people that use truecrypt, resurrecting the project seems a good thing.

You clearly did not get the point, but let's move along your argument.
E-mail not allowing one to make his ego appreciated and envied in a structured nicely formatted page maybe?
Can you recode outlook, eudora and other closed source stuff people use(d) for e-mail handling for business? No? Well, that answers why it is hard to remove.
Little proprietary walled gardens are absolutely not the answer for this problem.
The gateway idea is interesting, but it has to be efficient enough and low cost enough for people to switch over. Something like bitmessage is not.
I think that answers your concern about SMTP transport in the clear, in less than one year the darkest bar in that chart will be close to 100%. If 80% of hosts demand strict encrypted transport, it will force the other 20% to change. Considering the snowden revelations and the fact that one year ago we barely used encrypted transport, having 1/4 already and accelerating is a good prospect.
Fixing the problem is better than overhauling all offices in the world, you clearly haven't been in may offices in your life.

Oh boy, here we go.
Those are hidden by use of TLS. Regarding government wanting your data in the clear by requesting it to the ISP you use, well switch your communications to another country, problem solved.
p2p is no panacea, it doesn't scale and it will never, ever be able to handle the latest netflixy app Joes are so much into. p2p is for techead kids like you, not for the masses. The masses do not understand it unless it brings spiderman, batman, faggotman hollywood garbage faster to their living rooms.

There is no way to hide metadata because you need a destination for your messages to arrive, you can't hide it even in Bitcoin, Tor or any other network which has to find its destinations to deliver its contents. The best you can do is cloak it, but like any cover there are means to uncover it.
What is Iran? What is Cuba? What is China? What is Switzerland?
Here is your problem, you hold a belief, I hold knowledge. That's the little difference between us. It is not possible to have fast p2p unless:
- Cable networks collaborate by increasing bandwidth 7 to 8 times the current levels without increasing costs. That was done Brazil and South Korea which now have much better internet than the US. But the US still rule as the biggest market;
- People accept a more bumpy internet experience;
The first thing people complained about Tor was that they couldn't run bittorrents with it and they couldn't see youtube.
I would it too, of course. But in order to make it work we have to dial back the complexity of our pages and our want for high definition videos.
It is not interesting to merely have an e-mail substitute, because instead of e-mail metadata spies will request our google search and navigation history. You will certainly send links and those tell a lot about what we are talking about.

"NSA proof" while provided by american citizens? lol
that's impossibru
For one reason: National Security Letters are not applicable just for businesses, otherwise there is Guantanamo, that's their last resort if they can't make you talk, no pun intended.
To be NSA proof, you gotta be non-american and live in a country that doesn't extradite to the US and also a country whose likelihood of you being smuggled by a special ops team is small. Like Brazil, China or Russia.
Switzerland is a known collaborator with the US in the same level of Germany, Poland or Sweden. You can't trust them.

It doesn't matter, if you got a link to the US like citizenship, you are liable to receive a NSL.
If you come from a poorly defended country, like say Saudi Arabia, they will snatch you out to guantanamo.
This kind of problem should be tackled by some honest idealists from either China, Russia, Brazil, India or other big country (Indonesia or Malaysia?) that doesn't extradite and would cause an enormous stink if one of their citizens was taken away to be tortured. If that country would not effectively attack the US in some very painful way.
Like I suppose you are Polish, if you are Polish, Poland itself will give you away to the US at the minimal sign of trouble. I don't blame Poland, it is that or being Russia's bitch. Poor Polen always squeezed.

Do Harvard and MIT offer complete graduation courses without your physical presence?
Are they willing to never step again in the US or its allied countries?
If any of those questions ys answered in the negative, then they will get a NSL asap.
But considering the lack of obvious financial backing, you already know who is backing them. And that's sad.

@_subject: Going to jail nowadays for owning a book, wtf? 
Would you be in favor of charging someone for possessing things like:
- A catalog of hacking tools;
- Pedophile instruction manual;
- Recipes for preparing human flesh;
Things like that remember me that google once did not have the capacity to exclude links from its systems, but because of pedophiles, they finally built that capacity. The next day the copyright industry was knocking at their door to take down content they previously couldn't because of the lack of technical capacity.
"Now Google don't have excuses." - I remember seeing that phrase in a New York magazine.
The only way to not have people charged because of a book would be to make legal all books no matter what and you guessed it right, it won't happen.
Because you, yourself, will be in favor of indicting people in at least one of the items I quoted, which automatically makes it legal to charge anyone because of possession of any book.
