Glow-in-the-dark f́biciániggers are not the militą́ry.  The militą́ry is
a sword, it knows nothing of why it does what it does.
Viόlence is a failed system.
'Archive Politics' is the future.
This is an insulting and inaccurate label, halalanon.

You mentioned nothing of the pale-stien occupied territories.
I think you mean 'hexagon', as in the 'Black Cube of Saturn'.
List states currently without a (((central bā́nk))).
Unironically acknowledging and validating the existence of a "state". Lol.
