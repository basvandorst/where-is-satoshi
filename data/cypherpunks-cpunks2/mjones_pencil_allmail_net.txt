Set a filter. I already have a dozen Brian Carroll and another dozen of Eugene Leitl on it. It gets deleted right away.
If only people would notice people going this way have never something relevant to say. It's only reposts, at best. And if someone depends on such a user for comments, maybe one is looking in the wrong direction for help.

Oh! How cute! Momma's boy has grown up. Now he's an IT something
somewhere. He's sooo smart he can get a Gmail.com account! And it's even
better! He can get a cutisie user name like electromagnetize. I'm in tears.
Thank you for letting us all know that. You are certain to have a big
future so to make your momma proud, not like her old man. Be sure not to
become an alcoholic, as it would take some of the shine of the small
town pride. Hey! You can even say you work for Google Inc. Nobody would
notice, I'm sure.
Way to go Brian! Hurray!
Now my mail filter has an extra a**hole on the /dev/null list.

Flash is proprietary. Meaning licensing problems with the media.
Flash is closed source. Meaning it can contain anything. See the latest talk about DLink routers.
Flash has its own bugs on top of the browser bugs.
Flash asks for rights to access the webcam.
Flash asks for rights to access the microphone.
Flash can tell on you in so many ways, including font lists.
Flash has its own way of upgrading although it's just a silly plugin and needs a browser to do its magic.
Flash, as you wrote, has a particular type of storage.
Flash, as you wrote, needs one extension or app to remove its storage and another extension in order to stop it from playing.
Are you sure these aren't enough reasons to remove any trace of it on a system you own?

Actually the idiot is someone who just does not back up important data.
A double idiot I see. I guess that's the trouble with large providers:
they let anybody in. Hence the bad publicity.
