This is the reason why I asked on this list and didn't attempt, for example, to try to capture the payload myself.  If competent security specialists do the baiting and the evaluating/dissection, it's a non-issue.
Well if you mitigate privately, how do you go about luring additional 0days out of FoxAcid's queue?  And even then how do you know you've reached the queue, or are sufficiently deep into it that releasing bug reports won't burn potentially valuable information?
But if you mean instead that the effort should be focused on redesigning browser security in some way to address a broader class of exploits of which FoxAcid is a part, how does keeping a payload private/unpatched further that goal?
That's a great reason to focus more effort on browser security (and security in general), finding sustainable and diverse models of funding for such efforts, etc.  But I fail to see how that is relevant fixing a bug related to a specific payload.
However, your comments do lead me to believe some private mitigation must be happening as we speak.  There must be some valuable information being gleaned by not releasing details about the payloads.  It's just difficult to surmise what that would be, given that the attackers know the cat is out of the bag and can probably guess that people are privately inspecting the payloads they are sending out.
