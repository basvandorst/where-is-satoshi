@_subject: A crowdfunding campaign to build a free baseband 
Although creating an open GSM mobile modem is an interesting technical exercise it seems to make sense ONLY if there are secure mobile networks within which to operate. Although someday that might happen alas this not even close to being the case (there are several OS SDR projects for base station/network infrastructure creation). All standardized mobile networks were created with significant influence from intel agencies and even if OS SDR networks were deployed they could not be made secure if they integrated with the S7 backbone/interchange of the current networks. Even if your project manages to yield the result desired it will still be stuck in the "matrix".
A much simpler, more secure and generally useful mobile system might result from mobile devices with hardended kernals/OS' using only WiFi in conjunction with good wireless hygine to prevent data leakage, a variety of available technologies to enable secure end-to-end voice and data communications. Secure paging, to alert users who's devices are not currently connected, should even be possible by adding a RTL receiver dongle and using appropriate tradecraft with existing pager networks (yes, they still exist and are used heavily by professionals (including sex workers), government and even devices calling for repair).
PS: Suggest you enable lower contribution steps for crowd funding. They are too high for many who might like to help but cannot afford or justify the current steps.

Most mobile phone users (like most citizens) are more than willing to sacrifice their privacy for convenience, socializing and entertainment. Educating them and changing their behaviours will, in the long run, probably bring the most benefits. Cypherpunks have been rather poor at this. A sucessful multiplayer game, requiring the use of criminal/spy/intel tradecraft and security tools, would be a great first step. Once these players integrate these tools and skills into their daily lives and pressure friends and family to do likewise it could prove insideous to law enforcement and intel agency privacy violations and turn the tide.
Having a fully open mobile phone is good first step which can improve privacy when used with existing mobile networks but its only a first step. Alternative networks (e.g., WiFi mesh and open femtocell networks) are an obvious direction for improvement but their build out is problematic. Another way is to enable alternative communications that either need no infrastructure (think amateur radio) or covertly utilize existing commercial services (I mentioned pagers in my last post). The mobile phones would offer excellent user interfaces and processing the element of an affordable and flexible software radio transceiver.
I delivered a paper last October regarding the reasons such alternatives are needed, reviewed recent developments and offered some practical directions for future work (some of which I am pursuing):

The Konekt Dash is a cellular development kit for building Internet of Things (IoT) devices. You can use it to build all sorts of fun connected products like sensors, tracking devices, alarm systems, connected car applications, and more (see examples below).
The Konekt Platform is made to bring enterprise grade features to the individual developer, so its perfect for a solo hobby project or building the connected hardware business of your dreams!
Each Konekt Dash comes preloaded with a Konekt Global SIM and 6 months of our basic data plan (1MB/month or 6MB total).  If you need more data, thats cool too; we have great carrier agreements already in place to provide super affordable connectivity at higher data levels (check the deets below for pricing).
The Konekt Dash will work anywhere you get a cellular signal and can easily and securely communicate to the internet or other devices via the Konekt Cloud.  Get started right away by choosing the SIM-only reward tier or one of our Cellular Ardunio, Pi, or Beaglebone Kits.  These rewards ship in May following the completion of the campaign.

I did not look closely at MIMO due to the lack of inexpensive SDR solutions and their lack of utility at lower bands.
Mainly price and frequency coverage. Since my interest is mainly on apps that require transmitting I did not focus on receviers. Starting at twice the HackRF's cost the USRPs are a best buy at the low end.
The HackRF's weakness main weakness is its 8-bit ADC and lack of pre-selector to limit strong out-of-band input signals and reduce out-of-band transmiter spurs. However, it has an internal header to which daughter boards can be added and its CPDL can be reprogrammed for these add-ons and other changes. On the receive side a cheap coax bandstop filter, with acceptable insertion loss, can easily be fabricated to knock down the FM broadcast and pager transmitter signals instead of a pre-selector.

It would seem that a GPS jammer keyfob, that could be turned off when desired, would do the trick. The GPS signal at ground level is very weak and only works due to a huge process gain. Narrowband jamming will desensitize the closeby tracker's front end easily countering that process gain without jamming more distanrt GPS receivers. Building such a jammer from cheap and available components should be easy.

Achieving receivers and spectrum analyzers with wide frequency coverage, high dynamic range and wide bandwidths (with very low noise circuitry, stable local oscillators, etc.) simultaneiously has, up till recently, demanded very high prices.

If some hardware hacker were to deliver a 14-16 bit ADC daughter board (there are afforadble chips offering up to 60M samples/sec) for the HackRF (it is provisioned to accept one) it could substantially improve its use.

The HackRF contains a LPC4320 which has unused capacity for light DSP and other tasking. For any heavy DSP it could use a FPGA. It has an internal header for expansions like this (and/or a higher resolution ADC and its CPLD can be reflashed to accomodate such changes. The HackRF, like all wideband, direct conversion, receivers, can suffer  LNA saturation from nearby/very strong out-of-band signals (pagers and  FM broadcasts). A cheap, simple, solution is a coax notch filter, in  line with the antenna. I've been experimenting with these and they seem  to work very well.
Here's my idea for a probe for an RF device.  The wavelength of a 2.45 GHz signal (WiFi) is about 12 cm.  A quarter-wave antenna would be 3 cm.  Or, that 3 cm could be in the form of a loop, at the end of a piece of.'hardline', or other coaxial cable.   (hardline would be best, I think, because it is a small diameter.  )           So, the diameter of the loop would be a bit more than 1 cm diameter, which is appropriate for finding tiny RF sources.  One side of the loop would be connected to the center conductor of the coax, and the other side of the loop connected to the shield of the coax.
Note:  The coax should probably have many dissipative RF beads strung along its length, in order to prevent the cable itself from picking up RF, and delivering to the loop on the end, thereby to be detected.       There are many different kinds of materials that such beads are made from; perhaps we can have an RF engineer chime in on the subject.  He can also tell us if the loop is too-badly mismatched (RF impedence) to the coax to function well.

That's the way things were about 25 or so years ago.  Wafers with photoresist were exposed with machines using UV, which over the years used ever-decreasing  wavelengths of UV, in equipment:436. 365nm, and 248nm, eventually reaching 193 nanometer UV.  In the 1970's, entire wafer-masks (which covered the entire wafer) were used.  This became impractical as feature-sizes were reduced.  Step-and-repeat devices ("wafer-steppers)    then allowed exposure of a much smaller portion of a wafer.  (these eventually used mirrors, rather than lenses, because it is hard to process UV in a solid lens.)   However, because the wavelength of light eventually became a large portion of the size of a chip feature (a line or a space) it was increasingly difficult to 'draw' the picture necessary to expose the resist on the wafer.  Due to many ever-more-heroic technologies, it eventually became possible to use 293 nanometer wavelength to expose features far smaller than the wavelength itself, which would have been considered phenomenal in the 1970's.  These days, EUV ("extreme ultraviolet") has been used for ever more small features.      EUV is strongly absorbed by air, so such exposure is typically done in a vacuum.
None that I'm aware of.  But EUV will take over from electron-beam:  The latter is quite slow, and typically has been used mostly for making masks.

It would seem that a GPS jammer keyfob, that could be turned off when desired, would do the trick. The GPS signal at ground level is very weak and only works due to a huge process gain. Narrowband jamming will desensitize the closeby tracker's front end easily countering that process gain without jamming more distanrt GPS receivers.

Although Kopp's paper lacks some critical design details there are other online papers that reveal the missing elements in sufficent detail. Key components not shown in the linked article are a Q-switch, a pulse compression device most often used in lasers, that decreases pulse width and increases pulse amplitude (the explosive's detoniation isn't brief enough) and the microwave generator's design.
Heck, according to Kopp you really don't even need an explosive pump. A lightening discharge (triggered by laser or a small rocket) will do the trick. An advantage of the lightening method is the device is not destroyed (if you can safely retrieve it). Disadvantage, you must hide the device near a target (with high lightening activity) for extended periods.

The IRS mainly determines if you are a contractor, for taxation purposes, by your other gainful activities. If you work solely for one client they usually consider you an employee. I suspect the IRS classification also applies in non-taxation contexts.

This series of handbooks is an attempt to provide a set of guidelines for effective tactical use of radios among small units, that will be universally relevant.
This first volume, Volume One, focuses on handheld team and squad level radios. This is information everyone in a unit should know. It covers the fundamentals, and progresses to more advanced information.
It is in PDF form.
Let me know what you think of it.

Although Kopp's paper lacks some critical design details there are other online papers that reveal the missing elements in sufficent detail. Key components not shown in the linked article are a Q-switch, a pulse compression device most often used in lasers, that decreases pulse width and increases pulse amplitude (the explosive's detoniation isn't brief enough) and the microwave generator's design.
Heck, according to Kopp you really don't even need an explosive pump. A lightening discharge (triggered by laser or a small rocket) will do the trick. An advantage of the lightening method is the device is not destroyed (if you can safely retrieve it). Disadvantage, you must hide the device near a target (with high lightening activity) for extended periods.

@_subject: FCC NPRM seeks to end open SDR 
Since the early days of open SDR these devices have been sold as test equipment which does not require onerous type approvals or certifications by the manufacturer or importer. The FCC now seeks to change this and require product features which block software changes after manufacture. This, of course, is the very heart of SDR and its prohibition would be nothing short of effectively banning SDR and any open source experimentation with RF signal processing beyond the theoretic.

@_subject: FCC NPRM seeks to end open SDR 
There are clear and limited definitions, unlikely to be changed, for what legally constitutes a "radio" or a "transmitter". The "mistake" of the SDR manufacturers was to ever call or market them anything but instruments (as Red Pitya has done). When the idea of classifying them as instruments was floated in the early days of the GnuRadio list (by Steve Schear) he cautioned to make sure the products weren't called anything that might even vaguely sound like a wireless device. Evidently the marketing people at these companies knew better.
End-user controlled software signal generation and capture techniques are now widely in use by premium instrument manufacturers. If the FCC attempts to curtail the frequencies, modulation types, etc. by these these test instruments I think there will be manufacturers screaming bloody murder.
Transmitters are generally much simpler electronically than receivers (which are much less regulated). They may be little more than a few components added to a digital circuit, as Rayzer pointed out, though that rarely leads to a generally useful device. Attaching a circuit which contains the necessary components to generate the desired digital signal (e.g., using a Direct Digital Synthesizer) and convert it to a quality analog one to a USB or on a header of a PC/SoC motherboard should provide a nice signal generator which could effectively bypass FCC enforcement (legally or otherwise).

to this sort of problem, because they're inherently chatty, and have
very limited reach.
Wireless meshes are usually short range but there is no architectural reason they can't be linked by LoS or even longer distances connections. One area familiar to hams in the VHF/UHF bands is troposcatter. Tropo is similar to the more common HF phenomenon ionospheric reflection ("skip") but instead uses refraction changes in lower layers of the atmosphere due to temperature/density differences.
Tropo is shorter range (generally 100-500 km) than skip and less RF efficient but tends to be more reliable and because it operates using much higher frequencies can support much higher bandwidth (data rates). All the VHF/UHF ham bands and several unlicensed bands (900 MHz, U.S. only), 2.4 GHz and 5.7 GHz can all support tropo though reflection efficiency tends to be greatest at the lower frequencies.
Until the advent of satellites tropo use was widespread by commercial and military. Now that anti-satellite tech is becoming more widespread (e.g., recent Chinese launches) tropo is again being investigated  I'm considering tropo experiments in one of the ham or ISM bands. Please PM if you might have SDR or RF skills, time and some money to throw toward this.
Speaking of skip, in my PP Hacker Conference slides  I discuss a variant, NVIS (Near Vertical Incident Skywave), first developed by the Germans during WW II, which allows HF stations operating between 2 - 12 MHz to bounce signals off the ionosphere for intermediate rage (25-100 km) non-LoS communications.

to this sort of problem, because they're inherently chatty, and have
very limited reach.
Wireless meshes are usually short range but there is no architectural reason they can't be linked by LoS or even longer distances connections. One area familiar to hams in the VHF/UHF bands is troposcatter. Tropo is similar to the more common HF phenomenon ionospheric reflection ("skip") but instead uses refraction changes in lower layers of the atmosphere due to temperature/density differences.
Tropo is shorter range (generally 100-500 km) than skip and less RF efficient but tends to be more reliable and because it operates using much higher frequencies can support much higher bandwidth (data rates). All the VHF/UHF ham bands and several unlicensed bands (900 MHz, U.S. only), 2.4 GHz and 5.7 GHz can all support tropo though reflection efficiency tends to be greatest at the lower frequencies.
Until the advent of satellites tropo use was widespread by commercial and military. Now that anti-satellite tech is becoming more widespread (e.g., recent Chinese launches) tropo is again being investigated  I'm considering tropo experiments in one of the ham or ISM bands. Please PM if you might have SDR or RF skills, time and some money to throw toward this.
Speaking of skip, in my PP Hacker Conference slides  I discuss a variant, NVIS (Near Vertical Incident Skywave), first developed by the Germans during WW II, which allows HF stations operating between 2 - 12 MHz to bounce signals off the ionosphere for intermediate rage (25-100 km) non-LoS communications.
