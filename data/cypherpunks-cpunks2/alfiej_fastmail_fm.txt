world lately seems to suggest that we don't. Skirting around this issue
(i.e. moving VPN hosting from jurisdiction to jurisdiction) just ends in
an arms race with governments worldwide. Unless the solution is a
perfect system that guarantees privacy and anonymity, even from the

political change.

IQT aren't a charity. If they are not taking equity or profits, then
they are wanting something else. From more reading, it looks like what
they do is provide funding to companies that have interesting products,
and pay to re-purpose for in-house use.
In other words, they are more like a high-valued customer that want for
heavy customisation. Perhaps this is an easier way to get shit done
rather than go through the request for tenders route.

Mark Thomas  cryptography
Can we please stop perpetuating that Open Source is the less secure
option? Linus said "given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow", he
didn't say "all bugs are non-existent".
Given an open source program, it can be accountable by anyone. If there
is a bug, it can be patched. If there is a deliberate backdoor, it can
be pointed to as an example of why to completely abandon the program and
mark the developer as tainted forever.
Given a proprietary program, it is accountable to the supplier and you
have no other option. If there is a bug, all you can do is hope for a
patch. If there is a deliberate backdoor, all you can do is hope that
someone will spots if it is ever reverse engineered.
In other words:
  - Open Source: "trust, but verify"
  - Proprietary: "trust, and have faith in the supplier"
Given the current Snowden climate, you would be naive to choose a
proprietary option. Prove me wrong.

All of the comments so far are playing into the red herring of the
technical issues of email backups. You're forgetting that losing email
access is now modus operandi to stonewalling investigations:
  -   - What people should be talking about instead is the drafting of a bill
for record retention following the requirements of Sarbanes–Oxley,
specifically for government communications to be used in criminal
investigations against the government. To be explicit, all government
communications should be duplicated into a read-only archive and kept
there for at minimum seven years. And to borrow from a now well-known
NSA program, an XKEYSCORE system should be developed where criminal
investigators can use "selectors" to target people and keywords.
The government shouldn't be worried if they have nothing to hide.

would then be replaced with the value from the DA call and no secrets

After the Apple encryption announcement, we had the usual pundits bring
up the Four Horsemen of the Infocalypse [1]:
  "Attorney General Eric Holder, the US top law enforcement official,
  said it is "worrisome" that tech companies are providing default
  encryption on consumer electronics. Locking the authorities out of
  being able to physically access the contents of devices puts children
  at risk, he said.
  ...
  Holder said he wants a backdoor to defeat encryption. He urged the
  tech sector "to work with us to ensure that law enforcement retains
  the ability, with court-authorization, to lawfully obtain information
  in the course of an investigation, such as catching kidnappers and
  sexual predators."
After reading Keybase cofounder Chris Coyne's response to the backdoor
nonsense, it got me thinking about cryptography and the Second
  "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free
  state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
  infringed."
As the US State Department classifies cryptography as a munition,
shouldn't the use of cryptography be protected under the 2nd Amendment?
If so, as the NSA continues its concerted effort to cripple encryption
by providers [3] [4], shouldn't this be seen as the equivalent of the

tell people that a warrant is in place via a tor and a hidden service
(let's call it WarrantWatch). Each post is a message from an admin of a

What concerns me is that from what I've seen, it only talks about
Australian academics publishing novel ideas. What is completely missing
is how these ammendments may affect Australian open source developers,
who are also non-academics, working on cryptosystems. If they publish a

Hi everyone,
We had someone loitering near our front office door today. The
conversation went like this:
  Me: What are you doing?
  Him: Nothing
  Me: Where are you from?
  Him: A company
  Me: Do you work for Google (he was wearing a Google t-shirt)?
  Him: No
  Me: Who do you work for?
  Him: Leidos
He had a device hidden near the stairwell door:
  Sorry for the low quality image. It was taken from a capture of a
video. I've got the video at work but would rather not release it as
yet because it has his face on it.
The diameter of the antenna base was around 2cm and the height
of the antenna was around 15cm.
Someone on Reddit said that it looked like a jammer. After going to
Google Images and searching for the following, it looks like he's on the
right track:
  - "GSM detector"
  - "GSM jammer"
  - "GPS detector"
  - "GPS jammer"
If anyone has info on what this device could be or where I could go to
get more info, that would be much appreciated.

I'm at home now so can't give you measurements based on the size of the
tiles vs the device from the video. I'll be in on Monday and update the
thread... but off the cuff I'd say about it's about 25cm X 25cm and 10cm
high. The Antennas base was around 2cm diameter and antenna height
around 20cm high.
He held it by a single antenna when he left, and the way how it swung as
he lifted it up onto his clipboard I'd say it wasn't light but wasn't
heavy. Random stab - 600g in total (I'm comparing it to a Kindle that
I've got near by).
Not sure how I could tell.
Only one light was constantly on. No flashing.

Sorry, I should have mentioned that Leidos are in the same building as
us. However, they are not on our floor and are seperated by a few
floors, so he had zero business being on our level. We're considering
getting building management to setup swipe access to our level.
Yes, you need RFID to get into our office space.
Yes. This was our main concern. Seeing the antennas made me immediately
think that it was some sort of pentest into our wifi.
Already done. I've shown the video to the other tenants on the same
floor and they have all turned on the awareness.
Management were as suspicious as I was. Since Snowden, we (I work at
FastMail) have upped our paranoia for obvious reasons as I would
consider us to be in the same boat as the other targets.
This makes sense. Never considered it before.
Yeah, that's why I was asking for info on the device. We wanted to know

He put it in near the stairwell door (almost next to our door RFID), but
it was in full view of anyone walking to the elevators. So I don't think
he was trying to hide, otherwise he would have done it from behind the

Interesting choice of words given the history:
    "The Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) was funded by siphoning off
  funds intended for the Marshall Plan"
What is the OPC?
    "The Office of Policy Coordination (OPC) was a United States covert
  psychological operations and paramilitary action organization. Created
  as an independent office in 1948, it was merged with the Central
  Intelligence Agency (CIA) in 1951."

Hi everyone,
We had someone loitering near our front office door today. The
conversation went like this:
  Me: What are you doing?
  Him: Nothing
  Me: Where are you from?
  Him: A company
  Me: Do you work for Google (he was wearing a Google t-shirt)?
  Him: No
  Me: Who do you work for?
  Him: Leidos
He had a device hidden near the stairwell door:
  Sorry for the low quality image. It was taken from a capture of a
video. I've got the video at work but would rather not release it as
yet because it has his face on it.
The diameter of the antenna base was around 2cm and the height
of the antenna was around 15cm.
Someone on Reddit said that it looked like a jammer. After going to
Google Images and searching for the following, it looks like he's on the
right track:
  - "GSM detector"
  - "GSM jammer"
  - "GPS detector"
  - "GPS jammer"
If anyone has info on what this device could be or where I could go to
get more info, that would be much appreciated.

I'm at home now so can't give you measurements based on the size of the
tiles vs the device from the video. I'll be in on Monday and update the
thread... but off the cuff I'd say about it's about 25cm X 25cm and 10cm
high. The Antennas base was around 2cm diameter and antenna height
around 20cm high.
He held it by a single antenna when he left, and the way how it swung as
he lifted it up onto his clipboard I'd say it wasn't light but wasn't
heavy. Random stab - 600g in total (I'm comparing it to a Kindle that
I've got near by).
Not sure how I could tell.
Only one light was constantly on. No flashing.

Sorry, I should have mentioned that Leidos are in the same building as
us. However, they are not on our floor and are seperated by a few
floors, so he had zero business being on our level. We're considering
getting building management to setup swipe access to our level.
Yes, you need RFID to get into our office space.
Yes. This was our main concern. Seeing the antennas made me immediately
think that it was some sort of pentest into our wifi.
Already done. I've shown the video to the other tenants on the same
floor and they have all turned on the awareness.
Management were as suspicious as I was. Since Snowden, we (I work at
FastMail) have upped our paranoia for obvious reasons as I would
consider us to be in the same boat as the other targets.
This makes sense. Never considered it before.
Yeah, that's why I was asking for info on the device. We wanted to know
what it was so we knew how to approach them.
Yep. Considering our options.
Thanks for your response.

Well that's interesting. I wondered why there were three units.
He put it in near the stairwell door (almost next to our door RFID), but
it was in full view of anyone walking to the elevators. So I don't think
he was trying to hide, otherwise he would have done it from behind the
stairwell door and not in plain sight. Maybe it was just bad opsec?
Awesome. Thanks for the advice. Will look wireless intrusion detection.
WPA-Enterprise too.

The device was actually right next to our RFID reader for the office
door. He did manage to capture one person walk through, who then
alerted me to his presence.
Yeah, our netsec is best practice.

How about the reverse? As the point of canaries is to let people know a
warrant is in place while thinking that you're not breaking any laws by
telling them (good luck), hypothetically why not just be up front and
tell people that a warrant is in place via a tor and a hidden service
(let's call it WarrantWatch). Each post is a message from an admin of a

@_subject: Why cryptome sold web logs to their paying customers? 
Not necessarily...
Logs in /var/log is where they should be by default, but if the box is
on a shared hosting account, then things are completely different. For
instance, Bluehost charges $3.95/month, which gets you a home directory
on a box shared with hundreds of other users. In your home directory,
you get something like (from memory, which was a long, long time ago):
  ~/
  ~/public_www/
  ~/public_www/html/
  ~/public_www/access_log
  ~/public_www/error_log
So as you can see, the user does have permissions to access logs, but
are kept in the user's _home_ directory. Now you can see why this could
have mistakenly been distributed:
  tar zcf cryptome-backup.tar.gz ~/
The backup would have also slurped in all the logs. There was no malice,
just an easy mistake that everyone here could have make given the same

So Nginx has a built-in module "ngx_http_gzip_module" which does the
following (if "Accept-Encoding: gzip" was part of the request headers) :
  - Sees request for "foo.html"
  - Checks if "foo.html.gz" exists
  - If so, serves that in place of the "foo.html"
  - If not, gzips "foo.html" on the fly
What would be nice is an Nginx module which did the same type of thing,
but for hashing the body:
  - Sees request for "foo.html"
  - Checks if "foo.html.sha256" exists
  - If so, serves "foo.html" along with "Content-Hash: " header,
    taken from contents of "foo.html.sha256"
  - If not, serves "foo.html" along with "Content-Hash: "
    header, but calculated on the fly
This would be a cheap and easy way to get some form of content hashing.
