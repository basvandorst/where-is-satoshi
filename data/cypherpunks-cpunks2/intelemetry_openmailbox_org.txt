Jim, astute and concise reply as always. If you're looking for a
shorter tract on some of Murphy's work you should consult this:
The Mises Institute is good about making their work freely available
as well.
I think the idea of assassination politics distills to a very
insightful approach to defense and crowdsourcing in general.
However, from the vantage point of anarchism one crucial aspect worthy
of consideration is that of self autonomy and negative liberty. You
don't have "freedom to," but rather "freedom from" the state. With
assassination politics there is an argument that this is retributive
justice regarding compulsory theft of assets (and property, in certain
instances). However, I strongly urge you to consider that the taking
of a life is serious business.
Consider this:
- -hack.html
There are lesser means that can be employed and crowdfunded which
could strongly dis-incentivize working for the state (such as invasion
of privacy, which is arguably retributive with respect to Rothbard's
notion of justice).
The problem with David Friedman is that he approaches
Anarchocapitalism like a problem in physics. It will just end up a
certain way because market forces will make things happen. However,
one thing that he does not take into consideration (for instance,
where he differs from the Independent Institute and the Mises
Institute) is the notion of individual freedom and the right of
neither the state nor any external actor to violate your personal
autonomy (which you can extrapolate from your body/mind and unto you
- From the Friedmanite perspective, citizenry will kill the state, the
state will kill back, and the process will reach an equilibrium. While
that might work in the 'market sense,' to reach that state requires
pretty grotesque action to take place.
That is the problem with Utilitarian Anarchocapitalism. There is no
real consideration of actual human rights, it is a market driven
theory on how society could potentially function in the absence of the
state. Nothing more.

I selected Murphy because you mentioned Friedman's hard problem of
privatizing defense without the presence of state actors. Your
solution is crowdfunding assassinations of anybody who is unpopular.
This does fit within the paradigm of Friedman's approach.
I would argue that Murphy's approach of collectives banding together
and entering into private arbitration agreements with private defense
contractors is more reasonable in preserving liberty and security. By
entering into said private arbitration agreement with a private
defense force, you also have aspects of private jurisprudence. The
arbitration clause can have stipulations for certain scenarios and how
they are dealt with (e.g., trials, fines, etc).
Democracy is the tyranny of the majority, and assassination politics
is dangerous in that regard when they are coupled. Private arbitration
agreements with private security forces wherein mobility has
reciprocal agreements (similar to current travel) seems more reasonable.
I would suggest you consider the countereconomics work of SEK (e.g.
agorism) and Vaclav Benda. Benda is an interesting case because he did
his work on parallel structures while under the Soviet Union.
The conclusion was that -- in the presence of an oppressive state -- a
robust solution was an overlay of private and hidden societies as
opposed to direct overt warfare with the state.
I think your assumptions regarding the average American are wrong, but
that is my opinion. Don't underestimate the power of memetic warfare,
neurolinguistic programming, and general propaganda.
 But he may not be aware that it has been estimated that in the 20th
century, about 250 million people DIED, killed by the actions of
   Does Murphy impllicitly or explicitly say that is somehow "okay"?
I very much doubt he'd say that was acceptable, and he probably
couldn't argue much with the numbers themselves.  But suppose those
"average Americans" were FIRST fully informed of this fact, even
simply as an estimate.  THEN, suppose it was explained to him HOW a
functioning AP system wouldn't allow that to happen, if necessary by
killing whatever number of government employees were necessary to stop
this, the "Democide".   If those "average Americans" were reminded
that the death of a government employee is no more unfortunate than
the death of ordinary citizens, then wouldn't it be reasonable to
conclude that to save 250 million ordinary citizens, it would
certainly be acceptable to kill 25 million government employees, and
certainly 2.5 million government employees?
There are arguably technical countermeasures to his argument. E.g. PoC:

Organized crime and corporations use private security forces. In fact,
in situations where there is a state but law enforcement does not
exist gangs effectively perform this function. You adhere to a group
wherein your membership is an arbitration agreement that includes
protection in exchange for whatever it is you must do.
In certain ethnic areas private law enforcement is carried out on an
ad-hoc, hierarchical community level wherein citizens don't trust the

My question here is regarding the covert exfil of the hack.
Check out somebody like darktrace: That egress would be a monumental NOC IDS trigger, especially for an
anomaly detection system. Have to imagine the database is big.
Especially if you do anomaly detection on the SIEM collecting things
like DNS, flow, etc.
Probably a pivot into the Oracle database. The coupling between
PeopleSoft and the backend is weird.
The question is whether this is everybody because agencies sponsor
clearance and may or may not partition their own records on the backend.
Something doesn't make sense here. If they can catch the white house
non-classified penetration with low traffic and no exfil the OPM hack
seems like it should have been detected easily. Moreover, there are
automatic kill-chains in a lot of this infrastructure:
== begin white house ==
== end white house ==
I have to imagine they have a switch with inline and span analytics
and IDS/IPS, anomaly detection, and logging from multiple telemetry
sources. Grabbing that data from that network and running remotely
seems like a hefty attack without compromising the actual reporting
devices. Which has been done:
