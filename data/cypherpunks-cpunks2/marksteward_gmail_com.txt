trying to work out who's on whose side.

This is a decent list of people to plonk if you're a cryptography
researcher trying to keep up with the state of the art without being
bombarded by tangential political in-fighting and vanity posts. If you do
want to opt into the latter, you'd join cpunks.

I don't think you have a clue what libertarian means.
I see you're authoritarian about language too. Philosophy's history, much

Also cyberpunk. Imagine a dystopic future of lonely, once angry, now tired
individuals who lash out at any suggestion they are wrong. Back in the 90s
they might have been nudged to tinker with crypto and empowering the world,
but instead they spent their time seeing how many times they could fit
"fuck" and "retard" into an email post.
