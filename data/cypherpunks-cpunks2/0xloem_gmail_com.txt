PR, I'm having a psychotic break after talking with a real therapist
who knows about brainwashing.  I get to talk with them again later!
Given your name is PR, you know how to kill people, right?  You give
them secrets to share that are bigger than their safety network can

I heard the other way is to pin things they did not do on them.
Sorry for posting when I do not want to, and for posting crazy things.
Be well, list.

Sounds like we agree and it is very hard to talk about it.  We keep talking
about small things we disagree about instead.
Anyway, ownership and non-ownership are basically the same thing: people
NEED to be able to live by  personal agreements they make with their
neighbors and families.  We can't have huge organisations forcing clothes
off of or on to our backs.

I am being forced to post to this list.  I have been doing things at times
I hate to do them ever since I was entrained by an algorithm that studied
my responses to triggering imagery around 2013.

Sorry, yeah, I spout antiblame because I was forced to disrupt communities
and turn people against each other, and would be very happy if it turned
into a religion because fewer people would die.
Hey, um ... would you like me to filter your posts out?  You reference my
stuff sometimes.  What kind of responses are better for you?

<3 you PR!  I still think your name is awesome.  ... I'll have google
add a label to your posts in my client that says 'REQUESTED RATIONAL
RESPONSES ONLY' or somesuch which hopefully will stop me from

I've handled this a lot and physical objects and password storage
software is helpful.
Re: biometrics, crazy people have specific muscle motion patterns they
settle into that you might be able to profile in combination with
something else.  of course non-crazy people have this too.
(psychosis is scary.  it causes slow well-documented brain damage.
the antipsychotics cause a different kind of brain damage, kind of a
pick-your-situation thing except where you have to pick one of the
antipsychotics.  they don't like to talk about those things.)

people also develop really personalised phrases or experiences.  like
the woman experiencing visions of murdering her children might never
forget a password that said "I don't want to kill my kids."
