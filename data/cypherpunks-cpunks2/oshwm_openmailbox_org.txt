Basically, you have a bunch of tools designed to hide your
communications when using the internet.
This particular set of tools has at it's core, The Onion Router (Tor)
which passes your internet communications via many different proxies
using multiple layers of encryption so that none of the proxies in the
middle of this chain can identify the source and destination of the
Tor can be used to hide your communications when looking at normal
websites such as  but this carries a risk.
Any of the proxies can be monitored and using traffic correlation you
can be identified by comparing the communications entering Tor and
exiting Tor (to reach the website).
To avoid this, you can use Tor to only access Hidden web servers so that
your traffic never leaves the Tor network, making the traffic
correlation techniques much harder to do.
These hidden web servers are only visible in the Tor network and their
web addresses end in .onion
Hence, people referring to onions :)
So, if you wish to view the content on the hidden servers like the one
coderman linked to then you need access to the Tor network.
The Tor project make a modified version of the Firefox web browser
available for download and install that gives a simple way to access Tor
without having to do much messing about with your computer.
It also, has a modified configuration to reduce the amount of private
information you leak when using it.
Information from the horses mouth:
Download the Tor Browser:
The quality of information available at the Tor link will far surpass
what I have just written and you should assume small but possibly
devastating inaccuracies in my description above :)
Sorry for the long post but I couldn't think of a quick way of writing
it if you haven't come across Tor before.
There are also other similar systems: i2p, freenet but Tor seems to be
the most popular.
Something to weigh up though is that Tor was created by the US Navy and
the project still receives US Government funding so you should probably
bear this in mind when using it although reading more information on the
Tor Project's website may or may not reduce feelings of discomfort that
come from knowing where the funding comes from.

Those people in the OPM leak who were using personal resources to
conduct government business got what they deserved (leaked).
Those who were being honest and kept business dealing to the appropriate

be leaked.
Then there is another group who work to deceive the public and preserve
the state at any cost, those also deserve to be leaked (NSA, CIA, FBI

Bollocks to Lazy People.
In the UK, when someone learns to drive a car they take an average of 25
lessons because its not easy to drive a car safely and skillfully.
After they pass a relatively difficult theory and practical test they
appreciate that they are now only truly beginning to get to grips with
the skills required to drive well.
To learn to use GPG/PGP sufficiently to sign and encrypt mail isn't even
a fraction of the skill level or time required as learning to drive and
there's plenty of free guides on the internet.
So, the issue is one of motivation, not difficulty.
Can GPG be easier to use, I think so, is it too difficult to use by
ordinary people - no, they're just too fucking lazy and lack motivation.
You want people to use crypto, scare the fucking living daylights out of
them about how their governments and corporations are becoming way too
powerful and just maybe they'll become motivated enough to overcome
their laziness.
Otherwise, the only option is to make GPG transparent by getting the
email providers to automatically create key pairs and automatically
handle signing and encryption by integrating their mail services with
GPG behind the scenes.
However, if we wish to promote choice then this isn't a good way to go
about it.
This method would also have implications for privacy and anonymity too
as communications between the email client and mail servers may occur
when a user is not expecting it.

What's the excuse once it has a nice UI?
As for nobody is using PGP, I think that may be a little overstated -
what you mean is nobody who doesn't give a fuck about privacy is using it.
except the key has been around for quite some time, I did re-sync with
the sks servers yesterday.
No, it hasn't been signed by anyone as I don't have any friends in real
life who give two shits about security as I mix with non-techies offline.
This is not a difficulty issue, I can't even begin to talk about
encryption with them without them changing the issue to great subjects
such as what was on telly last night.
Oh yeh, some bright spark came up with STARTTLS for encrypting comms
with mail servers but made it optional, not a GPG issue.
However, the metadata issue a big problem for everyone who connects to a
server that isn't owned by them and I suspect really requires a new mail
protocol to resolve.

for email sender authenticity.
2) That's part of what PGP is about - sender authenticity. My PGP is not

That seems easy enough though that even a Windows user could manage it.
The tough bit is understanding crypto but with analogies about keys and

USE GPG rather than Prime Numbery stuff - they should be able to cope.

If I seem angry then it is because everyone seems to say that making a
nice easy to use User Interface will solve all the problems with people
not using crypto.
This is not the case, Enigmail is a pretty easy to use UI for PGP and
yet ordinary people aren't using it.
The vast majority of people (not through their own fault, originally)
have been programmed to be spoon fed the answers to their needs, not
question authority and to only have a 20 second attention span.
These are the issues that need addressing, pretty crypto is useful but
it will not address these issues.
So, go ahead and make pretty crypto UI and see how much of a difference
it makes, or find a way (and I'm at a loss myself here) to motivate the
sheeple to invest time and effort and overcome their programming.

Ok, how about this then...
Your idea on your blog is pretty cool but I think there is an even
simpler way to handle this.
When you sign up for a new mail account, the mail provider generates a
public/private key pair.
It automatically pushes the public key to PGP key servers around the
globe (including its own key servers that it maintains).
The private key is stored by your email provider but protected with your
mail account password (not perfect but simple).
Whenever you send an email to anyone, their email addresses are used to
find a public key for them and then the email is automatically encrypted
and signed using your private key.
For those people who sign up to other services then they can during the
sign up process, allow that service to access their private key to link
the service to their email and their GPG identity - but it can be done
using very simple language such as "allow linking to your email").
For existing mail accounts, the email provider can offer to add
additional security to the users mail account without mentioning PGP
even once.
All of the necessary simplified jargon to do this exists in the day to
day language used by people using email.
More advanced users could have access through 'advanced' mail client
menus if they wanted it etc.
There you go, this could even be done for people who just don't give a
shit about privacy with pretty much no effort and no special language.
let me know once you're done implementing it :D

Bollocks to Lazy People.
In the UK, when someone learns to drive a car they take an average of 25
lessons because its not easy to drive a car safely and skillfully.
After they pass a relatively difficult theory and practical test they
appreciate that they are now only truly beginning to get to grips with
the skills required to drive well.
To learn to use GPG/PGP sufficiently to sign and encrypt mail isn't even
a fraction of the skill level or time required as learning to drive and
there's plenty of free guides on the internet.
So, the issue is one of motivation, not difficulty.
Can GPG be easier to use, I think so, is it too difficult to use by
ordinary people - no, they're just too fucking lazy and lack motivation.
You want people to use crypto, scare the fucking living daylights out of
them about how their governments and corporations are becoming way too
powerful and just maybe they'll become motivated enough to overcome
their laziness.
Otherwise, the only option is to make GPG transparent by getting the
email providers to automatically create key pairs and automatically
handle signing and encryption by integrating their mail services with
GPG behind the scenes.
However, if we wish to promote choice then this isn't a good way to go
about it.
This method would also have implications for privacy and anonymity too
as communications between the email client and mail servers may occur
when a user is not expecting it.

Slick UI would be cool, just a shame that's being used as an excuse by
ppl who can't be arsed to do a bit of work.
What's the excuse once it has a nice UI?
As for nobody is using PGP, I think that may be a little overstated -
what you mean is nobody who doesn't give a fuck about privacy is using it.
except the key has been around for quite some time, I did re-sync with
the sks servers yesterday.
No, it hasn't been signed by anyone as I don't have any friends in real
life who give two shits about security as I mix with non-techies offline.
This is not a difficulty issue, I can't even begin to talk about
encryption with them without them changing the issue to great subjects
such as what was on telly last night.
Oh yeh, some bright spark came up with STARTTLS for encrypting comms
with mail servers but made it optional, not a GPG issue.
However, the metadata issue a big problem for everyone who connects to a
server that isn't owned by them and I suspect really requires a new mail
protocol to resolve.
1) friend network - can't be avoided if you want a system for vouching
for email sender authenticity.
2) That's part of what PGP is about - sender authenticity. My PGP is not
attached to a Gov Issued ID.

Click on the little options button (three lines) at the top right of

I double click on my key to show the details about it.

Well, that was quite simple, its almost as if someone created a not
perfect but workable User Interface called Enigmail - it even has a
Wizard for creating new keys and configuring Thunderbird.
It's gets more tricky if you have multiple email accounts in Thunderbird
but not prohibitively so.
It's not created by Apple so the shiny things fanboi's will hate it.
That seems easy enough though that even a Windows user could manage it.
The tough bit is understanding crypto but with analogies about keys and
shit then most people only need a superficial understanding of how to
USE GPG rather than Prime Numbery stuff - they should be able to cope.

You think if crypto is invisible to people then they'll be able to deal

If I seem angry then it is because everyone seems to say that making a
nice easy to use User Interface will solve all the problems with people
not using crypto.
This is not the case, Enigmail is a pretty easy to use UI for PGP and
yet ordinary people aren't using it.
The vast majority of people (not through their own fault, originally)
have been programmed to be spoon fed the answers to their needs, not
question authority and to only have a 20 second attention span.
These are the issues that need addressing, pretty crypto is useful but
it will not address these issues.
So, go ahead and make pretty crypto UI and see how much of a difference
it makes, or find a way (and I'm at a loss myself here) to motivate the
sheeple to invest time and effort and overcome their programming.

that Microsoft will never act in a way inconsistent with your privacy or
PGP: decentralized authentication where the amount of trust you have in

comes complexity because you don't have some benevolent overlord taking

Take your pick, personally I don't trust big corporations and for that

Ok, how about this then...
Your idea on your blog is pretty cool but I think there is an even
simpler way to handle this.
When you sign up for a new mail account, the mail provider generates a
public/private key pair.
It automatically pushes the public key to PGP key servers around the
globe (including its own key servers that it maintains).
The private key is stored by your email provider but protected with your
mail account password (not perfect but simple).
Whenever you send an email to anyone, their email addresses are used to
find a public key for them and then the email is automatically encrypted
and signed using your private key.
For those people who sign up to other services then they can during the
sign up process, allow that service to access their private key to link
the service to their email and their GPG identity - but it can be done
using very simple language such as "allow linking to your email").
For existing mail accounts, the email provider can offer to add
additional security to the users mail account without mentioning PGP
even once.
All of the necessary simplified jargon to do this exists in the day to
day language used by people using email.
More advanced users could have access through 'advanced' mail client
menus if they wanted it etc.
There you go, this could even be done for people who just don't give a
shit about privacy with pretty much no effort and no special language.
let me know once you're done implementing it :D

Bollocks to Lazy People.
In the UK, when someone learns to drive a car they take an average of 25
lessons because its not easy to drive a car safely and skillfully.
After they pass a relatively difficult theory and practical test they
appreciate that they are now only truly beginning to get to grips with
the skills required to drive well.
To learn to use GPG/PGP sufficiently to sign and encrypt mail isn't even
a fraction of the skill level or time required as learning to drive and
there's plenty of free guides on the internet.
So, the issue is one of motivation, not difficulty.
Can GPG be easier to use, I think so, is it too difficult to use by
ordinary people - no, they're just too fucking lazy and lack motivation.
You want people to use crypto, scare the fucking living daylights out of
them about how their governments and corporations are becoming way too
powerful and just maybe they'll become motivated enough to overcome
their laziness.
Otherwise, the only option is to make GPG transparent by getting the
email providers to automatically create key pairs and automatically
handle signing and encryption by integrating their mail services with
GPG behind the scenes.
However, if we wish to promote choice then this isn't a good way to go
about it.
This method would also have implications for privacy and anonymity too
as communications between the email client and mail servers may occur
when a user is not expecting it.

Slick UI would be cool, just a shame that's being used as an excuse by
ppl who can't be arsed to do a bit of work.
What's the excuse once it has a nice UI?
As for nobody is using PGP, I think that may be a little overstated -
what you mean is nobody who doesn't give a fuck about privacy is using it.
except the key has been around for quite some time, I did re-sync with
the sks servers yesterday.
No, it hasn't been signed by anyone as I don't have any friends in real
life who give two shits about security as I mix with non-techies offline.
This is not a difficulty issue, I can't even begin to talk about
encryption with them without them changing the issue to great subjects
such as what was on telly last night.
Oh yeh, some bright spark came up with STARTTLS for encrypting comms
with mail servers but made it optional, not a GPG issue.
However, the metadata issue a big problem for everyone who connects to a
server that isn't owned by them and I suspect really requires a new mail
protocol to resolve.
1) friend network - can't be avoided if you want a system for vouching
for email sender authenticity.
2) That's part of what PGP is about - sender authenticity. My PGP is not
attached to a Gov Issued ID.

Click on the little options button (three lines) at the top right of

A list of local copies of keys will appear, including my own private ones.
I double click on my key to show the details about it.
This includes the creation date of 23/07/15.
Well, that was quite simple, its almost as if someone created a not
perfect but workable User Interface called Enigmail - it even has a
Wizard for creating new keys and configuring Thunderbird.
It's gets more tricky if you have multiple email accounts in Thunderbird
but not prohibitively so.
It's not created by Apple so the shiny things fanboi's will hate it.
That seems easy enough though that even a Windows user could manage it.
The tough bit is understanding crypto but with analogies about keys and
shit then most people only need a superficial understanding of how to
USE GPG rather than Prime Numbery stuff - they should be able to cope.

If I seem angry then it is because everyone seems to say that making a

not using crypto.
This is not the case, Enigmail is a pretty easy to use UI for PGP and
yet ordinary people aren't using it.
The vast majority of people (not through their own fault, originally)
have been programmed to be spoon fed the answers to their needs, not
question authority and to only have a 20 second attention span.
These are the issues that need addressing, pretty crypto is useful but
it will not address these issues.
So, go ahead and make pretty crypto UI and see how much of a difference
it makes, or find a way (and I'm at a loss myself here) to motivate the
sheeple to invest time and effort and overcome their programming.

Ok, how about this then...
Your idea on your blog is pretty cool but I think there is an even
simpler way to handle this.
When you sign up for a new mail account, the mail provider generates a
public/private key pair.
It automatically pushes the public key to PGP key servers around the
globe (including its own key servers that it maintains).
The private key is stored by your email provider but protected with your
mail account password (not perfect but simple).
Whenever you send an email to anyone, their email addresses are used to
find a public key for them and then the email is automatically encrypted
and signed using your private key.
For those people who sign up to other services then they can during the
sign up process, allow that service to access their private key to link
the service to their email and their GPG identity - but it can be done
using very simple language such as "allow linking to your email").
For existing mail accounts, the email provider can offer to add
additional security to the users mail account without mentioning PGP
even once.
All of the necessary simplified jargon to do this exists in the day to
day language used by people using email.
More advanced users could have access through 'advanced' mail client
menus if they wanted it etc.
There you go, this could even be done for people who just don't give a
shit about privacy with pretty much no effort and no special language.
let me know once you're done implementing it :D

"For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the mission's already

Actually, machinery and robots will deal with most of these issues.
Not Artificial Intelligence though.
This is because if we create AI to do our bidding then we have created a
new class of slave but by using non-AI machines then we avoid the
consciousness problem.
We have machines to cover the entire supply chain from raw materials to
end user delivery and machines to repair the machines (and of course
machines to repair the repair machines :D ).
This removes the whole market system because if you want it then the
machines will create it for you, for free.
Removing the market system removes any financially based conflict and if
everything is available to everyone for free whenever they want it then
greed/one-upmanship as a problem gets eliminated.
As for how to reach this great state of Nirvana? Its very simple, we
wait for the capitalists to replace all their current set of slaves with
far more efficient machinery to do their work and then we just take over
them :)
Oligarchs and bullies etc become less of an issue due to the removal of
money, leaving just the psychopath types.
These are dealt with by educating our children to be strong and face
down these psychopaths for the good of everyone including themselves
(re-purposing of the patriotism system to simply one of supporting life
and freedom in general).
People will die in these battles but also a deterrence is created by
raising the stakes that any attack on someone is likely to fail or
result in death of the attacker.
Also, we teach everyone that the only justifiable and decent fight is
one of self-defence (not pre-emptive self-defence either).
To peacefully reach this point would take (imho) at least three
generations if everyone on the planet committed to work towards it now.
When people talk of a free market, they are simply looking for a
justification for screwing over other humans. People need to forget the
idea that a free market is fair or decent and if they want a free market
then they need to know that their actions have consequences of suffering
for other living people and they need to square that with their own
conscience rather than try to excuse it away.

keypress timings?
I'd modify the keyboard firmware to collate keys and feed them to the
OpSys with random time intervals between each key.
This would create a constantly changing profile of your keyboard usage
and prevent pinning it down to any one particular user.
The reason I'd go for the keyboard firmware is because it *may* stand
less chance of being modified by an "interested third party" than the
OpSys or Browser.
In terms of word timing and grammar, that's likely impossible to
mitigate at keyboard firmware level due to the time that a user would be
willing to wait for feedback from their typing and lack of grammatical
awareness of the keyboard firmware :)

My first thoughts were to use fixed timing but quickly realised that for
fixed timing to work, EVERYONE using a keyboard/mouse would have to have
their firmware modified otherwise your fixed timing would identify you
just as surely as your genuine timing patterns.
The randomness will also make each user appear as many different users -
not just hiding existing users but giving the impression that there are
many more users out there than truly exist (increasing the size of the
This is exactly why modifying the firmware would be better than running
software either within the OpSys or on top of it - by the time your
software gets a look at the keystroke timing then another 'driver' etc
could already have seen it.
It is surprising to know that Javascript is fast enough not to have an
impact on system performance when monitoring the keystroke timing!

In which case you'd need access to a lot of studies on these kinds of
things in order to create more human timing with a degree of randomness.
Hence why I said to MN that I'd welcome more detail on how the
monitoring/attacks work so that I could change from my current
simplified view of the issue to a more sophisticated one :)
I guess you'd ideally have keyboard layout profiles for every locale so
that you could emulate multiple locations rather than tying the fake

I feel the need to respond here although previously having sat and
watched as I was involved quite heavily in the CF/freedom.press discussion.
So, here's my viewpoint:-
EVERYONE is responsible for their own OpSec and can trust NO website no
matter who created/maintains it.
You can't even trust the infrastructure that your data travels on -
check out you cable/DSL router, the ISP has remote access to it and
that's in your own property supposedly managed by you.
Having said that, it is the duty of EVERY honest website owner to reduce
the amount of user data they hold and/or expose - to do any different is
reckless, inconsiderate and possibly dangerous.
With respect to Cloudflare, there are a different set of problems:-
1) MiTM - they terminate your secure connections without letting you
know BEFORE you connect or transfer confidential communications.
2) They sit in the path fo so much internet traffic that just CF alone
can be used to correlate various bits of data/metadata with regards to
someone that they are a one corp logging system for TLA's etc.
This issue is far larger than the cryptome one although cryptome is
going against what I wrote earlier about data reduction.
freedom.press, like MANY other organisations around the world are using
Cloudflare's services in full knowledge that they MiTM and provide a
irresistable data collection and collation point for the TLA's.
And yet, still claim to be fighting for the good guys.
Snowden? He has his own agenda and is using the "leaks" (if they are
real) to push that agenda - if you agree with what he wants "a
conversation about mass surveillance" then cool, cheer him on (whether
his data is crap or not), otherwise he can be ignored for the most part
as your OpSec should assume EVERYTHING is compromised right down to
discrete component level (think you can't fit an IC into the casing of a
resistor or diode?).
As for Best, as previously said, I haven't time at the moment to review
the data he has presented to know if he has an angle or if he's just a
good guy.
Position clarified enough?

My first thought was that an error in the 4xx range was an
authentication/authorisation error (henc the suggestion of blacklisted
Tor exits).
Error 403 states that your request was authenticated but the server
refused to return content to you.
This would be expected for blacklisted IPs but as you stated, using
clearweb IP addresses you got similar behaviour and thus would reduce
the chances that this is due to blacklisting.
The fact that you get a 403 means that the operating System is not
suffering any issues as it is passing the request up to the daemon
software (in this case nginx if the http headers are to be believed).
So nginx itself is functioning well enough to return the 403s and
therefore my guess is that it is refusing some requests in order to
avoid increasing load.
I would expect this is by design in order to avoid uncontrolled failure
of the daemon.
Of course, some of the above is guesswork and so I could be completely
wrong :D

Not quite...
When your ISP (and every other ISP/Peer) logs traffic then you can
circumvent this by using a VPN/Tor/i2p etc and so the only logs they get
prove that you are a privacy conscious customer who is actively using
the internet.
You can't use VPN/Tor/i2p to bypass the CDN's because the CDN is the
endpoint in your communications.
Therefore, the CDN has access to the entire contents of your
communications which allows them to gather a massive amount of
information about you.
When they can do this across multiple websites then the ability to

Unfortunately, avoiding CDNs is difficult because they are part of the
Corporate and Government effort to centralise the web for exactly the
reasons I outlined above.
So, the wise person expects to lose freedom but the wiser person does
everything they can to reduce the loss.
One of the things that surprises me on this list is the number of people

Actually, machinery and robots will deal with most of these issues.
Not Artificial Intelligence though.
This is because if we create AI to do our bidding then we have created a
new class of slave but by using non-AI machines then we avoid the
consciousness problem.
We have machines to cover the entire supply chain from raw materials to
end user delivery and machines to repair the machines (and of course
machines to repair the repair machines :D ).
This removes the whole market system because if you want it then the
machines will create it for you, for free.
Removing the market system removes any financially based conflict and if
everything is available to everyone for free whenever they want it then
greed/one-upmanship as a problem gets eliminated.
As for how to reach this great state of Nirvana? Its very simple, we
wait for the capitalists to replace all their current set of slaves with
far more efficient machinery to do their work and then we just take over
them :)
Oligarchs and bullies etc become less of an issue due to the removal of
money, leaving just the psychopath types.
These are dealt with by educating our children to be strong and face
down these psychopaths for the good of everyone including themselves
(re-purposing of the patriotism system to simply one of supporting life
and freedom in general).
People will die in these battles but also a deterrence is created by
raising the stakes that any attack on someone is likely to fail or
result in death of the attacker.
Also, we teach everyone that the only justifiable and decent fight is
one of self-defence (not pre-emptive self-defence either).
To peacefully reach this point would take (imho) at least three
generations if everyone on the planet committed to work towards it now.
When people talk of a free market, they are simply looking for a
justification for screwing over other humans. People need to forget the
idea that a free market is fair or decent and if they want a free market
then they need to know that their actions have consequences of suffering
for other living people and they need to square that with their own
conscience rather than try to excuse it away.

keypress timings?
I'd modify the keyboard firmware to collate keys and feed them to the
OpSys with random time intervals between each key.
This would create a constantly changing profile of your keyboard usage
and prevent pinning it down to any one particular user.
The reason I'd go for the keyboard firmware is because it *may* stand
less chance of being modified by an "interested third party" than the
OpSys or Browser.
In terms of word timing and grammar, that's likely impossible to
mitigate at keyboard firmware level due to the time that a user would be
willing to wait for feedback from their typing and lack of grammatical
awareness of the keyboard firmware :)

My first thoughts were to use fixed timing but quickly realised that for
fixed timing to work, EVERYONE using a keyboard/mouse would have to have
their firmware modified otherwise your fixed timing would identify you
just as surely as your genuine timing patterns.
The randomness will also make each user appear as many different users -
not just hiding existing users but giving the impression that there are
many more users out there than truly exist (increasing the size of the
This is exactly why modifying the firmware would be better than running
software either within the OpSys or on top of it - by the time your
software gets a look at the keystroke timing then another 'driver' etc
could already have seen it.
It is surprising to know that Javascript is fast enough not to have an
impact on system performance when monitoring the keystroke timing!

In which case you'd need access to a lot of studies on these kinds of
things in order to create more human timing with a degree of randomness.
Hence why I said to MN that I'd welcome more detail on how the
monitoring/attacks work so that I could change from my current
simplified view of the issue to a more sophisticated one :)
I guess you'd ideally have keyboard layout profiles for every locale so
that you could emulate multiple locations rather than tying the fake

I feel the need to respond here although previously having sat and
watched as I was involved quite heavily in the CF/freedom.press discussion.
So, here's my viewpoint:-
EVERYONE is responsible for their own OpSec and can trust NO website no
matter who created/maintains it.
You can't even trust the infrastructure that your data travels on -
check out you cable/DSL router, the ISP has remote access to it and
that's in your own property supposedly managed by you.
Having said that, it is the duty of EVERY honest website owner to reduce
the amount of user data they hold and/or expose - to do any different is
reckless, inconsiderate and possibly dangerous.
With respect to Cloudflare, there are a different set of problems:-
1) MiTM - they terminate your secure connections without letting you
know BEFORE you connect or transfer confidential communications.
2) They sit in the path fo so much internet traffic that just CF alone
can be used to correlate various bits of data/metadata with regards to
someone that they are a one corp logging system for TLA's etc.
This issue is far larger than the cryptome one although cryptome is
going against what I wrote earlier about data reduction.
freedom.press, like MANY other organisations around the world are using
Cloudflare's services in full knowledge that they MiTM and provide a
irresistable data collection and collation point for the TLA's.
And yet, still claim to be fighting for the good guys.
Snowden? He has his own agenda and is using the "leaks" (if they are
real) to push that agenda - if you agree with what he wants "a
conversation about mass surveillance" then cool, cheer him on (whether
his data is crap or not), otherwise he can be ignored for the most part
as your OpSec should assume EVERYTHING is compromised right down to
discrete component level (think you can't fit an IC into the casing of a
resistor or diode?).
As for Best, as previously said, I haven't time at the moment to review
the data he has presented to know if he has an angle or if he's just a
good guy.

My first thought was that an error in the 4xx range was an
authentication/authorisation error (henc the suggestion of blacklisted
Tor exits).
Error 403 states that your request was authenticated but the server
refused to return content to you.
This would be expected for blacklisted IPs but as you stated, using
clearweb IP addresses you got similar behaviour and thus would reduce
the chances that this is due to blacklisting.
The fact that you get a 403 means that the operating System is not
suffering any issues as it is passing the request up to the daemon
software (in this case nginx if the http headers are to be believed).
So nginx itself is functioning well enough to return the 403s and
therefore my guess is that it is refusing some requests in order to
avoid increasing load.
I would expect this is by design in order to avoid uncontrolled failure
of the daemon.
Of course, some of the above is guesswork and so I could be completely
wrong :D

correlate that information into a complete profile of you and your
online activities becomes very dangerous.
Unfortunately, avoiding CDNs is difficult because they are part of the
Corporate and Government effort to centralise the web for exactly the
reasons I outlined above.
So, the wise person expects to lose freedom but the wiser person does
everything they can to reduce the loss.
One of the things that surprises me on this list is the number of people
who are happy to accept the loss of privacy that the modern web allows.
It's as if this isn't the Cypherpunks list after all!!!

Maybe manufacturers aren't sure what they should be building in order to
genuinely and honestly be able to market as 'Respects Your Privacy'.
It sounds simple but when you look at the ultimate level of privacy
protection then you are talking about open source hardware, software and
manufacturing processes and proper auditing of all of these.
For a company to manufacture and market a device under these conditions
is likely to be hideously expensive and have a very small customer base
who are willing to pay such a large price in cash terms.
What might be a good idea is for a community such as this one to create
some sort of scale which describes the methods, materials and processes
to achieve some sort of scoring which would range from 'NSA Spying
Device' (0 out of 10) to 'Complete Privacy Protection' (10 out of 10).
This would then allow manufacturers to work to a specific score and
advertise as such.

One of the guys on here, razer ray?, linked to a Yasha Levine article linking CF CEO to Project Honeypot and reckoned he was encouraged to start CF by DoD or some other Gov agency.

Not sure if I'm missing something here but CF's CEO confirmed what I had
tested on Twitter.
The Web Service owners have to give CF their private keys.
So they are complicit in giving away your "secure" communications to CF
(and whoever they are buddies with, whether it be Advertisers or NSA et al).
But they do not tell the end users that they are using a service such as
CF which if they did would at least give the end users a chance to make
their own mind up.
This is an issue that needs to be looked at but using WAF's is not a
solution to DDoS, it's a malware solution so in fact they only need to
ensure your traffic passes through CF without decrypting it to gain DDoS
protection - that is a routing issue.
There is a big problem with the centralisation with the internet in this
way but it is also very difficult and costly to for a website to handle
large volumes of traffic in an independent DC.
But responding to DDoS by using services such as CF is playing into the
hands of the likes of the NSA who may well be behind a number of the
attacks in order to promote the CF "solution".
Snowden is a moderate extremist, he doesn't want transparent government
and private individuals, he just wants a discussion on where to draw the
line with surveillance, his leaks are purely to further this aim.
Assange and the people who have worked with him on leaks are more the
kind of people we need.

At the very least, for any organisation who wants to be associated with

If they maintain their aloofness and satisfaction with not giving a fuck

@_subject: Tor being forked. 
Without being able to offer my time, my comments don't carry much
weight, but it would be great if it natively supported i2p as well :)
I can configure TBB to support i2p (there are instructions out there for
everyone) but it would give i2p greater exposure and people an obvious
choice if i2p was supported without any configuration work.

@_subject: Tor being forked. 
As a first relatively easy step towards a generic browser supporting
multiple mixnets this might not be a bad start.
It wrestles control of TBB from TorCorp and with additional protocols
would remove the dependancy on the compromised Tor exit nodes, possibly
even use some sort of 'least cost routing' style of algorithm to spread
traffic across the fastest or most secure network depending on user
preference and based on destination.
Maybe add an element of randomness to mixnet choice as well to make
traffic analysis more difficult :)
Longer term goals should be development of a secure browser from the
ground up, not basing it on any Mozilla/Apple/Google code - and having
it audited.

Better still would be a way for any number of list servers to co-exist without delivering multiple copies of mail.
This would allow anyone to set up another server at will and add robustness to the system.
Is this already in existence or a new idea, is it even a valid idea?

The only issue with both of these is the potential for backdoors in the hardware when they're shipped compared to the sources.
Without Openfabs with ability for interested ppl to go in unannounced to check/audit then we can't escape this risk.

obviously elle-twat wants to derail your sensible questions.
If your encryption is sufficiently strong (ppl seem happy with AES256, any better suggestions) and your random number generator wasn't designed or influenced by the NSA then you're likely to keep your information private.
Note that you will then become the weak link and if the information is sufficiently important then it will get painful :)
In terms of a Windows (you said Outlook) based remailer then I'd see Windows as the weak link, especially if its v7/8 or 10.

In terms of things such as self-defence, the gov heavily push the idea that you don't need to defend yourself, just call the police instead - needless to say, they're only really effective at shooting innocent Brazilians or defending the gov itself.

Unless the peoples minds can be 'reprogrammed' then those of us subversive types who have somehow avoided being brainwashed will become criminals according to the state.
So, Brits on the list, expect a bumpy ride.

V for Vendetta has a fairly 'underground-ish' following in UK.
Although I think most of those that have watched it have simply written it off as an amusing tale about a near future that would never happen as our gov woyldn't ever get that bad :)
In terms of things such as self-defence, the gov heavily push the idea that you don't need to defend yourself, just call the police instead - needless to say, they're only really effective at shooting innocent Brazilians or defending the gov itself.
people have been taught to be weak, to accept their fate and do as they're told.

No, i was being an arsehole :)
Is that important to you?
No, Eugen threatened to leave the list if we didn't do as they wanted - as if they were doing us a great favour by blessing us with their 'presence'.
Eugen's participation is for their own benefit, any benefit we get is a side effect and can be gained from multiple sources.
This is supposed to be Cypherpunks, not cypher-rather-nice-gentle-ppl and as such the noise is as important as the signal (imho of course).
The calls for moderation have made me wonder if they are attempts by some 3rd party (grubbyments?) to take control of something they haven't been able to defeat and to subdue it to the point that participants walk away from something that no longer stands for anything worthwhile.
Although the irony of my response did give me cause to smile.

Everyone has been bought, by the time you realise that your favourite anti-hero has turned then you are already several years too late.

Then what is the use of asking someone to write a bubble sort (which has been written a million times) - surely you should pick something that hasn't been written before?

Personally I could believe that, in the UK at least, given 5-10 years that EVs will be sold in significant numbers and occupying the place in car sales that diesels currently occupy with total sales dominance over all car sales in about 20 years.
Self-Drivers will grow to share a significant amount of market share in that 20 year timescale.
Of course, I have no qualifications to back up my guesswork so we'll have to wait 20 years to see if my guesswork beats Ivy League economists guesswork lol.

More importantly is the easy way for governments to identify those subversive types who like to challenge the supremacy of the corporation sponsored state by driving their own cars.

So now that he's no longer being prosecuted by the Swedes, he's available for extradition to the US - wonder if that Grand Jury has recently finished putting its case together?
