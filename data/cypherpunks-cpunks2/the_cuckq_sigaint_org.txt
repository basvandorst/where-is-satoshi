No shit.  Prevention is the point of Tor, not damage mitigation, i.e.,
TIL: privacy = cult
What a fagq
It is only posturing, isn't it
Without security there is no privacy; isn't this guy a philosopher king; wtf
Bullshit, VPNs are guaranteed to fail
Tor is at least a gamble, until trust-aware path selection enables a
better experience
This fuckq with the pro-LEA false narratives
Neither are "whites"
Again with the false narratives
I guess he never used IE/Edge or Chrome
What a newb
This guy is fucking retarded
Not knowing who dun it doesn't mean it could be anybody
Seeing a user as a regular Chrome, FF, or Safari user does more for
anonymity than Tor homogeneity
It is clear that they are actively attacking people, why use inaccurate
