@_subject: Linux users receive a lot of assistance 
Hello Terry,
I'm sure John will reply too, but I have to put in my 2c's worth. The biggest difference you will experience as a Linux user is the amount of help and assistance that is available. If you join your local LUG (Linux Users Group) you may end up with a house full of helpful geeks! horrors!  Linux newbies are treated with a deference never accorded to WIndows newbies.
None of your M$ flavour software operates under Linux but that is really no hardship as the quantity and quality of USEFUL software is very extensive. To preview such offerings go to   there are many other sites that offer Linux software but this is everyones favourite starting place.
Hardware can present a problem if you have Win specific items. I have a Brother PC label maker that requires Windows so I am stuck with a dual boot machine until I can sort it
HTH.  Tony.

There was a lot of information there.  The links were useful and
worked just fine.  I felt the only way to understand what was
happening would be to print off information and read it ON
PAPER OFFLINE.
At first glance this is an extremely well designed site.
Navigation is easy, color choices are great and no blatant errors.
However after spending over 10 minutes going through the site
for several pages and checking the Questions and Answers page
and finally going to the order page before I could find out the
cost and possibly order the " sales kit ".
I find that the offer is not for anyone except US citizens - therefore
eliminating and alienating over 1/2 the internet .. ( Yes the US is
important but the internet is a WORLD WIDE web - about 55%
are not American. IF the product is not available anywhere else
except in the US at this time.  State that  on your opening
You may expand your market later to involve the majority of
Internet users who are Not living in the USA and might mention
that. The way it reads now you have P'd off anyone that had an
interest in your proposition and went to the trouble of going
through your presentation only to find that they can't order it.
Overall design plan is good in navigation and viewing, but it
is lacking in pictures.  Although graphics can slow a page
down some, it makes the reader want to read.   So add some
well placed graphics and maybe some pullquotes.   The title
"Quality Wholesale Merchandise" could also use a different
font or something.
This is a let's get down to business website.  Everything is
carefully explained and simple to understand.  Definitely
focused and sounds like a great business to be in.  The only
things I could suggest is to have testimonials from current
distributors and information about how long you have been
in business.
Great colour and layout consistent throughout the whole site,
with easy to follow text.  My only query was that International
involvement was not addressed.

@_subject: Computer freezing and a program to free up memory 
Hello Nicety,
I  have to agree with Jim Shofstall,   when he wrote in Exchange Issue  One major problem is that many programs don't release memory when you exit.  When working in Windoze I've always taken the approach of rebooting on a regular basis before I've had problems, I believe AOL is a shell that sits on Windows, which pretty much negates any hope for stability. *nix is the only non-Mac answer for reliable computing. I am a Red Hat Linux user as everyone's favourite Redmond OS obviously requires more smarts than I have to make it do anything useful. If you have to live with it however there is a cool little FREE download called FreeMem which you can get here;
This utility frees up memory at a click when you exit an app, you also get to see how your memory gets eaten up and not released. This may not fix your problem but at least Windows will be running at peak performance all the time and much easier than constant rebooting. The more you use this OS the more of these little third party fixer upper proggys and utilities you have to search for.
HTH.  Tony.

Just finished looking over your site. It's very flashy and maybe
just a tad overdone. I had difficulty finding my way around
your site and couldn't understand its purpose until I had gone
three pages into it. Maybe it would be a little more useful to
make your front page navigation a little less confusing?
The "next page" tab is right next to one that says "bookmark
this page" - no information until you mouseover the tab to
tell you you are entering the site. I felt a little overwhelmed
with glitz - animated gif's overemphasized words etc and not
enough information on your openning page.
I also surprised to see a site for Florida rentals with a URL
ending with .uk.  Recommendations for this site.
1. On the home page a person's eyes are drawn first to the
animation and red text on the yellow background, missing
the first sentence. Remove the animation and add more
details to this important introduction. Instead of using the
'click here' button, just have a text link following directly
after the introduction.
2. On the second page, have all your links the same color,
and all your text a different color. Don't confuse people on
what is a link and what they need to read. Underlined text
on the internet can often be confused for a link, expecially
when it is in the normal blue link color.  Having the
important links in red and with the flashing arrow is overkill.
3. On the rest of the site, you have good information, but
you don't need the top menu bar when using the framed
menu and the pages are all untitled.
I hope you don't think I'm being too harsh, I just know you
want the best site you can have and I think these changes
will make a world of difference.  Once a person gets into the
site you have the information organized and complete. I
even wanted to come and stay!
The animations make this site look amateurish from the
beginning.  The flashing "Bookmark This Site" makes me
want to leave instead of come back!  The font Comic Sans
MS also looks very kiddy.  Much could be done to improve
this site.
I was confused by this site. There are four animated gifs on the
first screen, and so my eyes kept flicking back and forth between
them. I read over the paragraph of information, but didn't know
where to click. I finally figured out the 'click here' button should
have been up by the text and that is where I should go.
On the 2nd page, again too many flashing gifs.  Other than that,
the 2nd page was much easier to find my way around. One
suggestion, if you're using frames it is unneccessary to have
the menu of links listed both on one frame and at the top of
the page as was shown on the 'special offers' page.
The font style and bright colors made the site look casual and
laid back, like a trip to Florida should be, so that was good.
Besides the flashing gifs, by the time I left I liked this site, but
if I hadn't been reviewing it I don't know if I would have gotten
that far.
This site is bright and breezy. It is very clean, easy to read
and navigate. Logically presented and information-rich.
Some pages had too many animated images for my own taste,
but the pages are happy and cheery. Tip: If you can get a hold
of PaintShop Pro, you can take out the white squares that
form a background for some images.
