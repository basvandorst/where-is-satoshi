@_subject: Bruce Schneier on the good, old air gap 
I like  Bruce much, i have read all of him, every book, mostly article,
from years. But no normal person would follow these advice, all smartphones
should be turned off, each tablet, and every pc should be turned in a
anonyomous client of an anonymous network. Sure, who believe in the
definitely find comfort in these indications, for example i am one. But those
who follow this model, really, are following it also not in only the
cyberspace, but also in the real life, every day ? Really? Internet is
perhaps evil but perhaps also our world is not so a sane and secure place,
sometime (or every time, depend).

I have posted this before in a linkedin group. It is really interesting
 the Mr, *Blaine Bateman* (also linkedin group member)
"Then what happened is some arrogant scientist at NIST (full disclosure--I
was formerly a NIST employee, and the terms of my departure still burn as a
fire in the pit of my stomach) conveniently "forgot" to put the correct
ones in the standard, or did it on purpose since "Anyone of modest skill in
cryptography will detect the problem and come up with their own P-Q pair
correctly. Anyone who doesn't deserves what they get." There are, in my
estimation, people that arrogant employed by NIST."
No good. No.

@_subject: Two possible vulnerabilities in OpenSSL? 
Yes, I had noticed your post on FD. In my opinion you are right,
the value that is compared can come from the outside.
It would be the same problem that is discussed (also) here. Perhaps
the solution might look like
the same.
Best regards
