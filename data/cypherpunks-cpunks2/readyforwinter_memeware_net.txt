Hash: SHA256
This is the thedarkoverlord here to deliver a message.
For those of you who live in the Nothern Hemisphere of planet Earth,
Autumn has come to an end and Winter has arrived. The deciduous trees
have been stripped nude with their discoloured leaves having fallen to
the ground. Many creatures have had to prepare for their hibernation in
Winter, eating and then gaining body fat (similar to humans during the
holidays which are celebrated during this time of year). However, the
creatures that make up thedarkoverlord do not hibernate, sleep, slow
down, pause, or stop. For they work around the clock, pillaging and
taking whatever they desire or seeping through the cracks of the
foundation of the unlucky entity they targeted, weaving into them
undetected and striking with surgical precision.
As 2018 has drawn to a close, we're welcoming 2019 with open arms and a
big announcement, as we've done in the past. Many companies have
received letters from us in the past few days and everyone who's a
prospective client of ours should take note of this announcement.
Throughout our demonic fits of hacking, we often come across or create
situations that turn quite peculiar very quickly. One such case was when
we initiated an action against a seemingly ordinary company located in
the United States, that unfortunately, didn't turn out the way we
wanted. We breached their network and stole hundreds of gigabytes of
litigation related documents (and others, that the world may soon come
to see). We investigated our grand pile of loot and we found documents
in regards to one of the most infamous events in the history of the
United States. The key is that the documents were not public, nor would
this company want them public. Not to mention thousands of documents
surrounding companies such as Monsanto, Bank of America, and many other
Fortune 500 companies. Hundreds of thousands of documents. What sorts of
documents, specifically? E-mails, retainer agreements, non-disclosure
agreements, settlements, litigation strategies, liability analysis,
defence formations, collection of expert witness testimonies,
testimonies, communications with government officials in countries all
over the world, voice mails, dealings with the FBI, USDOJ, DOD, and
more, confidential communications, and so much more.
We immediately approached this company with our most handsome business
proposition, which they were reluctant to accept. However, they
ultimately accepted and provided us a financial payment that satisfied
our agreement. However, as with previous clients in the past (we're
looking at you: Larson Studios), this client of ours also violated the
agreement and began cooperating with law enforcement, which our
agreements strictly forbid unless it's legally required of the client.
This involvement with law enforcement became clear to us months later
through a source of ours disclosing details of the client to us that we
never informed the source about. We were absolutely appalled by this
transgression against our agreement. We decided to offer this company a
second chance to repent, accept responsibility, and satisfy our penalty
request. They declined to accept our offer, so we're here today.
Let's get right into the juicy bits, shall we? Since our organisation
has been around, we've performed many hacks that have resulted in some
hilarious news articles and reports, grandiose stories of entire regions
closing schools, NSA, CIA, GCHQ investigating us, hoping to hunt us
down, raids all over the world, arrests of alleged members, and so much
more. Most of you may know us from our hacks of Netflix and other
studios such as ABC, HBO, CBS, and others. We do hope you haven't
cancelled your subscription to them. However, the entire planet will now
know our name as a result of a single client of ours failing our
arrangement and refusing to accept the fair penalties. Edward Snowden
leaks were quite impressive and caught the world's attention due to the
highly sensitive nature of the materials and the global impact. What
we're about to announce and leak will top Edward Snowden's finest work,
both in volume and in impact. We'll guarantee to all our astute readers
that the subsequent release of these materials will generate millions of
news articles and result in the biggest and most significant data breach
ever to have occurred.
Before we continue onto the story at hand, we'd like to remind the
people of this planet who we are. We're now going to quote one of our
own posts that we made on the very famous dark web hacker market and
forum 'KickAss' (which you can find at the Tor address after this
message) that was in response to a forum member stating that most
hackers have nothing to worry about "if you're hacking a small dog food
shop website, the people that will be after you won't be the same people
that after you if you are carbanak."
OUR RESPONSE:
"That's strange. We hack 'small dog food shops' regularly and yet we're
hunted by the NSA and CIA. Our threat model is quite different than the
majority of KA users. In fact, GCHQ has publicly released an advisory
about thedarkoverlord hacking organisation. The NSA and even the CIA
have been confirmed as hunting down thedarkoverlord. We're more hunted
than Carbanak.
Our favourite article:
[begin quote]
Flathead Valley authorities contacted the FBI about two days after
threats began, once they realized the group was not local. Lawrence said
experts from the CIA and NSA also became involved in investigating the hack.
"These were world-class people," Lawrence said.
At one point, unsuccessful raids were conducted in London attempting to
locate hackers, Lawrence said. But hackers use programs that cycle
rapidly through IP addresses, which can show where someone is connecting
to the internet, masking their location.
"They actually kicked down a couple of doors," Lawrence said.
[end quote]
Our second favourite:
[begin quote]
The Dark Overlord  Systematic cyber-enabled extortion
A cyber crime group called ‘The Dark Overlord’ has claimed
responsibility for conducting cyber-enabled extortion campaigns in
recent weeks. Victims include a London-based plastic surgery clinic and
a Hollywood production studio, both of which are believed to have a
number of high-profile clients. The group has a history of hacking
organisations to obtain sensitive information before demanding money in
exchange for not leaking it into the public domain. They leak snippets
of data to the media to encourage them to report on their activity. This
is aimed at “proving” that a breach has taken place, and increases the
pressure on the victim to pay the ransom. ‘The Dark Overlord’ has been
responsible for indiscriminately targeting health institutions, schools
and media production companies over the last year.
Any organisation that deals with sensitive personal information (e.g.
medical institutions, law firms) is at a higher risk of being targeted,
and owes a particular duty of care to its clients because of the risk of
severe emotional distress if client data is made public.  Whilst
evidence of the stolen data is often provided, the volume and
sensitivity of the data may be exaggerated to maximise impact. This may
inspire other cyber extortionists to adopt a similar methodology,
especially as new opportunities present themselves due to an increasing
amount of sensitive data being stored online. Any data breach and the
associated media exposure may cause significant reputational damage and
loss of business.
[end quote]
Listen to that one 'The Dark Overlord  Systematic cyber-enabled
extortion'. Beautiful.
As you can see, publicly reported proof that we have nation-states
hunting us, and we're still here, stronger than ever. We have government
agencies from all over the world writing advisories about our threat
[begin quote]
TDO engages in a pattern of verbal abuse and threats of violence during
communication with victims, regardless of the victims’ willingness to
pay extortion demands. In a recent incident, TDO threatened to publicize
the sensitive behavioral reports and private health information of
students. Throughout September and October 2017, TDO was reportedly
connected to multiple threats of violence on school campuses, often
prior to extortion attempts.
[end quote]
In fact, you can find dozens of videos of law enforcement agents
standing behind podiums speaking about how they're working to stop us,
from making appearances in conferences all over the world, to speaking
behind podiums in their districts after we've pwned a local business.
The United States Congress has even had a hearing about us, true story,
and Christopher Wray himself (director of the U.S. FBI) has testified
about his efforts against us.
Enjoy the director of the FBI speaking to U.S. Congress about
[begin quote]
Daines: “So I understand it’s an active investigation and you’re limited
in finding details however looking back at the big picture, what is the
F.B.I. doing to attribute these cyber crimes and help bring these
criminals to justice?”
Wray: “There’s a of variety of technological things we can do. We are
also working with partners to try to exchange information to help
identify telltale signs that may help us link back to particular
organizations. I think one of things we’re seeing more and more in this
area as much as any other is how this stuff transcends boundaries, and
so some of the same organizations are targeting victims in other
countries as well. We’re really working more and more with our partners
to try to see if we can have their two plus our two to get more than
four, to get five and six and so that we can really deal with these
otherwise very elusive foes.”
[end quote]
Listen to this: 'so that we can really deal with these otherwise very
elusive foes.'. We're 'very elusive foes'. Brilliant. Not to mention
we're published in virtually every major news publication. Let's chat
about threat models, shall we?"
END OF RESPONSE
We had the United State's Congress speaking about us then, now we'll see
how they speak about now, after this announcement. Now that you're
present on who we are and what we've done, let's dive deeper into this
Earlier in 2018, there was a fantastic and very brief article that was
published about a global insurer being hacked. The hackers weren't named
and the story fell to the darkness shortly after it came about. No
further mentions were made. You might guess who these hackers were.
Hello world! What was that story? It was this one:
What's the takeaway? We hacked Hiscox Syndicates Ltd.
And why didn't Hiscox Syndicates Ltd make this more public? Well, keep
reading on to find out! It wasn't just Hiscox Syndicates Ltd that was
put at risk, it was Lloyds of London as well as others. Another entity
unnamed in this article is Lloyds of London and who we'll attribute as
also being involved. Hiscox Syndicates Ltd and Lloyds of London are some
of the biggest insurers on the planet insuring everything from the
smallest policies to some of the largest policies on the planet, and who
even insured structures such as the World Trade Centers. At this point,
the keen amongst you may finally be drawing conclusions at this point,
but you'll still be astonished at what's to come. Keep reading. This
also means that Silverstein Properties is involved, doesn't it? Now
things are getting more interesting. Most of you readers will not be
privy to the processes and methods utilised by Fortune 500s to litigate
high-impact cases, but we are, and thankfully for us, we're going to let
you in on this process. When major incidents like the WTC 911 incident
happen, part of the litigation must involve SSI (Sensitive Security
Information) and SCI (Special Compartment Information) from the likes of
the FBI, CIA, TSA, FAA, DOD, and others being introduced into evidence,
but of course this can't become public, for fear of compromising a
nation's security, so they temporarily release these materials to the
solicitor firms involved in the litigation with the strict demand
they're destroyed after their use and that remain highly protected and
confidential to only be used behind closed doors. However, humans aren't
perfect and many of these documents don't become destroyed, and when
thedarkoverlord comes along hacking all these solicitor firms,
investment banks, and global insurers, we stumble upon the juiciest
secrets a government has to offer.
What's the takeaway? We hacked Lloyds of London and Silverstein Properties.
This release of 911 Litigation Documents is highly exclusive and only
available from thedarkoverlord! For a limited time only, we're leaking
the first few documents as proof of our trove on the famous dark web
hacker forum 'KickAss'. For those of you who are most interested in
acquiring the entire set of documents, which counts at over 18.000
documents, to include .doc, .pdf, .ppt, .xls, .tif, .msg, and many other
interesting formats (or just to acquire the most highly secret and
confidential documents), the good news for you is that we'll be selling
these documents for a limited time. If you're a terrorist organisation
such as ISIS/ISIL, Al-Qaeda, or a competing nation state of the USA such
as China or Russia, you're welcome to purchase our trove of documents.
You can easily contact us on the dark web hacker forum 'KickAss' or by
e-mailing us at the e-mail found below. We'll also sign our PGP key into
this message so that you may use our PGP key to contact us if you prefer
to be more discreet.
What we'll be releasing is the truth. The truth about one of the most
recognisable incidents in recent history and one which is shrouded in
mystery with little transparency and not many answers. What we're
offering to the world is the truth, exclusively from us, one of the
planets premier hacking organisations dedicated to breaching leading
targets and acquiring the most scandalous materials that we may use in
our systematic extortion campaigns.
If a full public release happens in the near future, we'll guarantee
that we're going to withhold only the most highly confidential and
sensitive documents for private sale. For the rest of you: don't worry,
there's thousands of documents still to go around.
If you're one of the dozens of solicitor firms who was involved in the
litigation, a politician who was involved in the case, a law enforcement
agency who was involved in the investigations, a property management
firm, an investment bank, a client of a client, a reference of a
reference, a global insurer, or whoever else, you're welcome to contact
our e-mail below and make a request to formally have your documents and
materials withdrawn from any eventual public release of the materials.
However, you'll be paying us.
If you're a member of the press and would like to make an enquiry, you
may do so at our press e-mail which is well known by members of the
press. You may acquire this from any reporters who've published our
quotes, as they all have it and will accept this signed announcement as
permission to share our press e-mail address with you.
We've linked below sixteen images from a very few of the documents from
the legal firm Blackwell Sanders Peper Martin, who is now Husch
Blackwell. More details and files are available on the KickAss dark web
hacker forum.
If the images above are taken down, use the link below:
LINK: We're also releasing a small part of the larger archive of the 911 World
Trade Center Litigation documents publicly. There's thousands of files
included in the archive. Everyone can freely have a copy of the archive
and we would encourage it. However, the archive is completely encrypted
using a very strong AES encryption and very strong master keys that will
prevent anyone from decrypting the veracrypt containers until we
publicly release the keys for each layer. The archive is split between
five layers. Layer 1 being the most modest, and Layer 5 containing the
most heavy hitting and impactful documents, with Layer 2, Layer 3, and
Layer 4 containing ever-increasingly scandalous materials. We encourage
everyone to obtain a copy of all five archives. As time goes on, we may
publicly release keys for each of these containers if our requests from
the involved companies are not met. The link to download the 10 GB
archive is below. Stay tuned for the possible release of decryption
keys. We may release these keys on our new official Twitter page
( and/or on the dark web hacker forum 'KickAss'.
Below is the link to the torrent file to download the archive. The
magnet URL follows the PGP at the end of this release.

And finally, a message to the companies directly involved to include the
airlines, government agencies, the dozens of solicitor firms, the
insurers, and the many others, this is a message directly to you: pay
the fuck up, or we're going to bury you with this. If you continue to
fail us, we'll escalate these releases by releasing the keys, each time
a Layer is opened, a new wave of liability will fall upon you. You know
our contact details.
You're welcome, heathens and what's the final lesson? When you're a
client of ours and you've accepted an agreement of ours: follow it to
the letter. We're not motivated by any political thoughts. We're not
hacktivists. We're motivated only by our pursuit of internet money

Interesting observation; is it accurate ? It seems like all these claims
are bullshit and simple noia, unless you travel abroad to non-free
caliphate states like in Europe. The feds can run disruption campaigns
against anybody they want but yet nobody bothers me. Maybe the trick is
to not be a snitch like John or Julian, even if the content they share
should have never been secret to begin with; the public are essentially
the board members of their govt and have the right to know everything
done with their money and/or in their name/interest.

random files from Layer 1, we chose 25 random files from the other
higher layers. What's in these files? We'll tell you briefly:
Highly confidential settlement documents
Highly confidential FBI interviews with involved persons
Highly confidential e-mails
Highly confidential judicial orders
Highly confidential sensitive security information
Highly confidential TSA, FBI, FAA files

Our Official Bitcoin Wallet Address: 192ZobzfZxAkacLGmg9oY4M9y8MVTPxh7U
As the world is aware, we released our first decryption key for the
'Preview_Documents.container' Veracrypt container that contained a small
sample of documents to continue to verify the authenticity of our
claims. The decryption key for this container is:
*CZ4=I{YZ456zGecgg9/cCz|zNP5bZ,nCvJqDZKrq at v?O5V$FezCNs26CD;e:%N^
There's five layers to go. Layer 1, 2, 3, 4, and fine finally Layer 5.
Each layer contains more secrets, more damaging materials, more SSI,
more SCI, more government investigation materials, and generally just
more truth. Consider our motivations (money, specifically Bitcoin),
we're not inclined to leak the juiciest items until we're paid in full.
However, in the interest of public awareness and transparency, we're
officially announcing our tiered compensation plan. Below, we'll
announce the required cost to release each layer of damaging documents
that are filled with new truths, never before seen. There's only one way
we can be paid: Bitcoin. There's two ways for you to pay us: you can
acquire BTC on your own and send it to our address and build the pool
directly, or you can bundle into groups and communities and create
GoFundMe pages that collect large amounts of fiat that can then be
converted, by the community leader, and used to purchase BTC to throw
into our wallet address. As more BTC is generated, more information will
be released. We're also going to introduce checkpoints between each
major funding goal that will result in some small samples to be released
from the next layer before the entire layer is allowed to be decrypted.
Our compensation structure follows:
Preview_Documents.container - Free, we released the key to prove
authenticity of our claims.
Checkpoint 01 - 250 USD of BTC = 25 'random' documents from Layer 1.
Checkpoint 02 - 500 USD of BTC = 25 'random' documents from Layer 1.
Checkpoint 03 - 750 USD of BTC = 40 'random' documents from Layer 1.
Checkpoint 04 - 1.000 USD of BTC = 50 'random' documents from Layer 1.
Layer_1.container - 5.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 1 Documents)
Checkpoint 05 - 6.500 USD of BTC = 50 'random' documents from Layer 2.
Checkpoint 06 - 8.500 USD of BTC = 50 'random' documents from Layer 2.
Checkpoint 07 - 12.000 USD of BTC = 50 'random' documents from Layer 2.
Checkpoint 08 - 25.000 USD of BTC = 50 'random' documents from Layer 2.
Layer_2.container - 50.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 2 Documents)
Checkpoint 09 - 65.000 USD of BTC = 100 'random' documents from Layer 3.
Checkpoint 10 - 85.000 USD of BTC = 100 'random' documents from Layer 3.
Layer_3.container - 100.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 2 Documents)
Checkpoint 11 - 250.000 USD of BTC = 250 'random' documents from Layer 4.
Checkpoint 12 - 500.000 USD of BTC = 250 'random' documents from Layer 4.
Layer_4.container - 1.000.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 4 Documents)
Checkpoint 13 - 1.500.000 USD of BTC = 5 'random' documents from Layer 5.
Layer_5.container - 2.000.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 5 Documents)
To clarify this structure, if we reach 10.000 USD of BTC, we'll release
the 'Layer_1.container' decryption key to the public via our official
Twitter. If another 90.000 USD of BTC is donated (for a total of 100.000
USD of BTC at this point), we'll release the decryption key for
'Layer_2.container' via our official Twitter, and so on. The
compensation is compounding structure, with the totals to be calculated
from the deposits into the BTC address time of their deposits.
We have a long history of trustworthy negotiations and resolutions with
many clients of ours. It's our goal to be financially compensated before
we initiate any brazen actions. You're motivated by your passions for
the truth, and we're motivated by our passion and love for Bitcoin.
Let's come to together and meet in the middle.

"9/11 Papers" MegaLeak - Layer 1 + Checkpoint 03, 04, 05, 06, & 07:
Cyber-Cash For Cyber-Cache
This is the thedarkoverlord here to deliver a message.
We're now calling this megaleak, the '9/11 Papers'. Keep giving us
cyber-cash for cyber-cache.
Hello, world. As you're well-aware, we designed a compensation plan that
would allow for the public crowd-funding of our organisation in order to
permit the public disclosure of our "9/11 Papers" in the interest of the
public. Part of this plan was to create a tiered escalation plan that
would result in multiple layers and milestones (which we're calling
checkpoints) to ensure the powers at be are being properly bent over a
barrel. We've said it before, and we'll say it again: we're financially
motivated, and you (the public) has spoken to us in our language
(internet money, specifically Bitcoin). Through voicing your
satisfaction by sending us 3.27 BTC for a total of over 12.000 USD of
BTC (at the time of writing), you've successfully unlocked Layer 1 as
well as Checkpoint 03, Checkpoint 04, Checkpoint 05, Checkpoint 06, and
Checkpoint 07. As with our previous paid releases, we've demonstrated to
you that we're honest about our intentions and we're transparent. As a
result of this most magnificent achievement, we're continuing to follow
the wishes of the public by releasing the Layers and Checkpoints we
promised you we would. Remember, continuing to fund our wallet will
continue to keep us motivated to help break the truth to the world by
open-sourcing what we're calling the "9/11 Papers". As such, let the
leaking continue:
Layer 1 = 500 Files
Checkpoint 05 = 50 Files
Checkpoint 06 = 50 Files
Checkpoint 07 = 50 Files

comprised of documents from Layer 1, but since the single donation
covered past Layer 1, we're releasing Layer 1 as an aggregate of itself
along with Checkpoint 03 and Checkpoint 04.
Let this serve as more definitive proof that what we're saying is true,
and that we're doing exactly as we promised you. Continue to keep the
bitcoins flowing, and we'll continue to keep the truth flowing.
Remember, Cyber-Cash for Cyber-Cache. We hope that there'll be more
releases. Continue to share these download links and decryption keys on
Reddit, 4chan, Steemit, Voat, your siblings, your friends, your pets,
and anyone else! We can't allow the mainstream media to silence the
truth any longer. We must ensure they're propaganda is crushed by the
truths we're dealing today.
Stay tuned on PasteBin for future announcements related to this leak.
We'll always sign all of our releases for verification of authenticity.

After the month-long winter festival that is Yule, now that the days get
longer, it is time to celebrate the Happy New Year ! May the Sun never
set !! Enjoy !!!
# 1.
Hash: SHA256
This is the thedarkoverlord here to deliver a message.
For those of you who live in the Nothern Hemisphere of planet Earth,
Autumn has come to an end and Winter has arrived. The deciduous trees
have been stripped nude with their discoloured leaves having fallen to
the ground. Many creatures have had to prepare for their hibernation in
Winter, eating and then gaining body fat (similar to humans during the
holidays which are celebrated during this time of year). However, the
creatures that make up thedarkoverlord do not hibernate, sleep, slow
down, pause, or stop. For they work around the clock, pillaging and
taking whatever they desire or seeping through the cracks of the
foundation of the unlucky entity they targeted, weaving into them
undetected and striking with surgical precision.
As 2018 has drawn to a close, we're welcoming 2019 with open arms and a
big announcement, as we've done in the past. Many companies have
received letters from us in the past few days and everyone who's a
prospective client of ours should take note of this announcement.
Throughout our demonic fits of hacking, we often come across or create
situations that turn quite peculiar very quickly. One such case was when
we initiated an action against a seemingly ordinary company located in
the United States, that unfortunately, didn't turn out the way we
wanted. We breached their network and stole hundreds of gigabytes of
litigation related documents (and others, that the world may soon come
to see). We investigated our grand pile of loot and we found documents
in regards to one of the most infamous events in the history of the
United States. The key is that the documents were not public, nor would
this company want them public. Not to mention thousands of documents
surrounding companies such as Monsanto, Bank of America, and many other
Fortune 500 companies. Hundreds of thousands of documents. What sorts of
documents, specifically? E-mails, retainer agreements, non-disclosure
agreements, settlements, litigation strategies, liability analysis,
defence formations, collection of expert witness testimonies,
testimonies, communications with government officials in countries all
over the world, voice mails, dealings with the FBI, USDOJ, DOD, and
more, confidential communications, and so much more.
We immediately approached this company with our most handsome business
proposition, which they were reluctant to accept. However, they
ultimately accepted and provided us a financial payment that satisfied
our agreement. However, as with previous clients in the past (we're
looking at you: Larson Studios), this client of ours also violated the
agreement and began cooperating with law enforcement, which our
agreements strictly forbid unless it's legally required of the client.
This involvement with law enforcement became clear to us months later
through a source of ours disclosing details of the client to us that we
never informed the source about. We were absolutely appalled by this
transgression against our agreement. We decided to offer this company a
second chance to repent, accept responsibility, and satisfy our penalty
request. They declined to accept our offer, so we're here today.
Let's get right into the juicy bits, shall we? Since our organisation
has been around, we've performed many hacks that have resulted in some
hilarious news articles and reports, grandiose stories of entire regions
closing schools, NSA, CIA, GCHQ investigating us, hoping to hunt us
down, raids all over the world, arrests of alleged members, and so much
more. Most of you may know us from our hacks of Netflix and other
studios such as ABC, HBO, CBS, and others. We do hope you haven't
cancelled your subscription to them. However, the entire planet will now
know our name as a result of a single client of ours failing our
arrangement and refusing to accept the fair penalties. Edward Snowden
leaks were quite impressive and caught the world's attention due to the
highly sensitive nature of the materials and the global impact. What
we're about to announce and leak will top Edward Snowden's finest work,
both in volume and in impact. We'll guarantee to all our astute readers
that the subsequent release of these materials will generate millions of
news articles and result in the biggest and most significant data breach
ever to have occurred.
Before we continue onto the story at hand, we'd like to remind the
people of this planet who we are. We're now going to quote one of our
own posts that we made on the very famous dark web hacker market and
forum 'KickAss' (which you can find at the Tor address after this
message) that was in response to a forum member stating that most
hackers have nothing to worry about "if you're hacking a small dog food
shop website, the people that will be after you won't be the same people
that after you if you are carbanak."
OUR RESPONSE:
"That's strange. We hack 'small dog food shops' regularly and yet we're
hunted by the NSA and CIA. Our threat model is quite different than the
majority of KA users. In fact, GCHQ has publicly released an advisory
about thedarkoverlord hacking organisation. The NSA and even the CIA
have been confirmed as hunting down thedarkoverlord. We're more hunted
than Carbanak.
Our favourite article:
[begin quote]
Flathead Valley authorities contacted the FBI about two days after
threats began, once they realized the group was not local. Lawrence said
experts from the CIA and NSA also became involved in investigating the hack.
"These were world-class people," Lawrence said.
At one point, unsuccessful raids were conducted in London attempting to
locate hackers, Lawrence said. But hackers use programs that cycle
rapidly through IP addresses, which can show where someone is connecting
to the internet, masking their location.
"They actually kicked down a couple of doors," Lawrence said.
[end quote]
Our second favourite:
[begin quote]
The Dark Overlord  Systematic cyber-enabled extortion
A cyber crime group called ‘The Dark Overlord’ has claimed
responsibility for conducting cyber-enabled extortion campaigns in
recent weeks. Victims include a London-based plastic surgery clinic and
a Hollywood production studio, both of which are believed to have a
number of high-profile clients. The group has a history of hacking
organisations to obtain sensitive information before demanding money in
exchange for not leaking it into the public domain. They leak snippets
of data to the media to encourage them to report on their activity. This
is aimed at “proving” that a breach has taken place, and increases the
pressure on the victim to pay the ransom. ‘The Dark Overlord’ has been
responsible for indiscriminately targeting health institutions, schools
and media production companies over the last year.
Any organisation that deals with sensitive personal information (e.g.
medical institutions, law firms) is at a higher risk of being targeted,
and owes a particular duty of care to its clients because of the risk of
severe emotional distress if client data is made public.  Whilst
evidence of the stolen data is often provided, the volume and
sensitivity of the data may be exaggerated to maximise impact. This may
inspire other cyber extortionists to adopt a similar methodology,
especially as new opportunities present themselves due to an increasing
amount of sensitive data being stored online. Any data breach and the
associated media exposure may cause significant reputational damage and
loss of business.
[end quote]
Listen to that one 'The Dark Overlord  Systematic cyber-enabled
extortion'. Beautiful.
As you can see, publicly reported proof that we have nation-states
hunting us, and we're still here, stronger than ever. We have government
agencies from all over the world writing advisories about our threat
[begin quote]
TDO engages in a pattern of verbal abuse and threats of violence during
communication with victims, regardless of the victims’ willingness to
pay extortion demands. In a recent incident, TDO threatened to publicize
the sensitive behavioral reports and private health information of
students. Throughout September and October 2017, TDO was reportedly
connected to multiple threats of violence on school campuses, often
prior to extortion attempts.
[end quote]
In fact, you can find dozens of videos of law enforcement agents
standing behind podiums speaking about how they're working to stop us,
from making appearances in conferences all over the world, to speaking
behind podiums in their districts after we've pwned a local business.
The United States Congress has even had a hearing about us, true story,
and Christopher Wray himself (director of the U.S. FBI) has testified
about his efforts against us.
Enjoy the director of the FBI speaking to U.S. Congress about
[begin quote]
Daines: “So I understand it’s an active investigation and you’re limited
in finding details however looking back at the big picture, what is the
F.B.I. doing to attribute these cyber crimes and help bring these
criminals to justice?”
Wray: “There’s a of variety of technological things we can do. We are
also working with partners to try to exchange information to help
identify telltale signs that may help us link back to particular
organizations. I think one of things we’re seeing more and more in this
area as much as any other is how this stuff transcends boundaries, and
so some of the same organizations are targeting victims in other
countries as well. We’re really working more and more with our partners
to try to see if we can have their two plus our two to get more than
four, to get five and six and so that we can really deal with these
otherwise very elusive foes.”
[end quote]
Listen to this: 'so that we can really deal with these otherwise very
elusive foes.'. We're 'very elusive foes'. Brilliant. Not to mention
we're published in virtually every major news publication. Let's chat
about threat models, shall we?"
END OF RESPONSE
We had the United State's Congress speaking about us then, now we'll see
how they speak about now, after this announcement. Now that you're
present on who we are and what we've done, let's dive deeper into this
Earlier in 2018, there was a fantastic and very brief article that was
published about a global insurer being hacked. The hackers weren't named
and the story fell to the darkness shortly after it came about. No
further mentions were made. You might guess who these hackers were.
Hello world! What was that story? It was this one:
What's the takeaway? We hacked Hiscox Syndicates Ltd.
And why didn't Hiscox Syndicates Ltd make this more public? Well, keep
reading on to find out! It wasn't just Hiscox Syndicates Ltd that was
put at risk, it was Lloyds of London as well as others. Another entity
unnamed in this article is Lloyds of London and who we'll attribute as
also being involved. Hiscox Syndicates Ltd and Lloyds of London are some
of the biggest insurers on the planet insuring everything from the
smallest policies to some of the largest policies on the planet, and who
even insured structures such as the World Trade Centers. At this point,
the keen amongst you may finally be drawing conclusions at this point,
but you'll still be astonished at what's to come. Keep reading. This
also means that Silverstein Properties is involved, doesn't it? Now
things are getting more interesting. Most of you readers will not be
privy to the processes and methods utilised by Fortune 500s to litigate
high-impact cases, but we are, and thankfully for us, we're going to let
you in on this process. When major incidents like the WTC 911 incident
happen, part of the litigation must involve SSI (Sensitive Security
Information) and SCI (Special Compartment Information) from the likes of
the FBI, CIA, TSA, FAA, DOD, and others being introduced into evidence,
but of course this can't become public, for fear of compromising a
nation's security, so they temporarily release these materials to the
solicitor firms involved in the litigation with the strict demand
they're destroyed after their use and that remain highly protected and
confidential to only be used behind closed doors. However, humans aren't
perfect and many of these documents don't become destroyed, and when
thedarkoverlord comes along hacking all these solicitor firms,
investment banks, and global insurers, we stumble upon the juiciest
secrets a government has to offer.
What's the takeaway? We hacked Lloyds of London and Silverstein Properties.
This release of 911 Litigation Documents is highly exclusive and only
available from thedarkoverlord! For a limited time only, we're leaking
the first few documents as proof of our trove on the famous dark web
hacker forum 'KickAss'. For those of you who are most interested in
acquiring the entire set of documents, which counts at over 18.000
documents, to include .doc, .pdf, .ppt, .xls, .tif, .msg, and many other
interesting formats (or just to acquire the most highly secret and
confidential documents), the good news for you is that we'll be selling
these documents for a limited time. If you're a terrorist organisation
such as ISIS/ISIL, Al-Qaeda, or a competing nation state of the USA such
as China or Russia, you're welcome to purchase our trove of documents.
You can easily contact us on the dark web hacker forum 'KickAss' or by
e-mailing us at the e-mail found below. We'll also sign our PGP key into
this message so that you may use our PGP key to contact us if you prefer
to be more discreet.
What we'll be releasing is the truth. The truth about one of the most
recognisable incidents in recent history and one which is shrouded in
mystery with little transparency and not many answers. What we're
offering to the world is the truth, exclusively from us, one of the
planets premier hacking organisations dedicated to breaching leading
targets and acquiring the most scandalous materials that we may use in
our systematic extortion campaigns.
If a full public release happens in the near future, we'll guarantee
that we're going to withhold only the most highly confidential and
sensitive documents for private sale. For the rest of you: don't worry,
there's thousands of documents still to go around.
If you're one of the dozens of solicitor firms who was involved in the
litigation, a politician who was involved in the case, a law enforcement
agency who was involved in the investigations, a property management
firm, an investment bank, a client of a client, a reference of a
reference, a global insurer, or whoever else, you're welcome to contact
our e-mail below and make a request to formally have your documents and
materials withdrawn from any eventual public release of the materials.
However, you'll be paying us.
If you're a member of the press and would like to make an enquiry, you
may do so at our press e-mail which is well known by members of the
press. You may acquire this from any reporters who've published our
quotes, as they all have it and will accept this signed announcement as
permission to share our press e-mail address with you.
We've linked below sixteen images from a very few of the documents from
the legal firm Blackwell Sanders Peper Martin, who is now Husch
Blackwell. More details and files are available on the KickAss dark web
hacker forum.
If the images above are taken down, use the link below:
LINK: We're also releasing a small part of the larger archive of the 911 World
Trade Center Litigation documents publicly. There's thousands of files
included in the archive. Everyone can freely have a copy of the archive
and we would encourage it. However, the archive is completely encrypted
using a very strong AES encryption and very strong master keys that will
prevent anyone from decrypting the veracrypt containers until we
publicly release the keys for each layer. The archive is split between
five layers. Layer 1 being the most modest, and Layer 5 containing the
most heavy hitting and impactful documents, with Layer 2, Layer 3, and
Layer 4 containing ever-increasingly scandalous materials. We encourage
everyone to obtain a copy of all five archives. As time goes on, we may
publicly release keys for each of these containers if our requests from
the involved companies are not met. The link to download the 10 GB
archive is below. Stay tuned for the possible release of decryption
keys. We may release these keys on our new official Twitter page
( and/or on the dark web hacker forum 'KickAss'.
Below is the link to the torrent file to download the archive. The
magnet URL follows the PGP at the end of this release.

And finally, a message to the companies directly involved to include the
airlines, government agencies, the dozens of solicitor firms, the
insurers, and the many others, this is a message directly to you: pay
the fuck up, or we're going to bury you with this. If you continue to
fail us, we'll escalate these releases by releasing the keys, each time
a Layer is opened, a new wave of liability will fall upon you. You know
our contact details.
You're welcome, heathens and what's the final lesson? When you're a
client of ours and you've accepted an agreement of ours: follow it to
the letter. We're not motivated by any political thoughts. We're not
hacktivists. We're motivated only by our pursuit of internet money
Stay tuned on PasteBin for future announcements related to this leak.

Interesting observation; is it accurate ? It seems like all these claims

caliphate states like in Europe. The feds can run disruption campaigns
against anybody they want but yet nobody bothers me. Maybe the trick is
to not be a snitch like John or Julian, even if the content they share

We hope that there'll be more releases. Keep up the Bitcoin payments.
Our reward: internet money, your reward: 9/11 secret documents, never
before seen by the public. Your money is unlocking the truth and
providing answers. Keep it flowing.
United States law enforcement agencies have attempted to silence us from
our releases by requesting Twitter to suspend our account. An appeal to
Twitter has gone unanswered. We'd like everyone to know that we're still
here. We've taken to Reddit with our own sub. We'll provide updates as
we have them.

TDO 911 Leak Documents Mirror

Hash: SHA256
This is the thedarkoverlord here to deliver a message.
Our Official Bitcoin Wallet Address: 192ZobzfZxAkacLGmg9oY4M9y8MVTPxh7U
As the world is aware, we released our first decryption key for the
'Preview_Documents.container' Veracrypt container that contained a small
sample of documents to continue to verify the authenticity of our
claims. The decryption key for this container is:
*CZ4=I{YZ456zGecgg9/cCz|zNP5bZ,nCvJqDZKrq at v?O5V$FezCNs26CD;e:%N^
There's five layers to go. Layer 1, 2, 3, 4, and fine finally Layer 5.
Each layer contains more secrets, more damaging materials, more SSI,
more SCI, more government investigation materials, and generally just
more truth. Consider our motivations (money, specifically Bitcoin),
we're not inclined to leak the juiciest items until we're paid in full.
However, in the interest of public awareness and transparency, we're
officially announcing our tiered compensation plan. Below, we'll
announce the required cost to release each layer of damaging documents
that are filled with new truths, never before seen. There's only one way
we can be paid: Bitcoin. There's two ways for you to pay us: you can
acquire BTC on your own and send it to our address and build the pool
directly, or you can bundle into groups and communities and create
GoFundMe pages that collect large amounts of fiat that can then be
converted, by the community leader, and used to purchase BTC to throw
into our wallet address. As more BTC is generated, more information will
be released. We're also going to introduce checkpoints between each
major funding goal that will result in some small samples to be released
from the next layer before the entire layer is allowed to be decrypted.
Our compensation structure follows:
Preview_Documents.container - Free, we released the key to prove
authenticity of our claims.
Checkpoint 01 - 250 USD of BTC = 25 'random' documents from Layer 1.
Checkpoint 02 - 500 USD of BTC = 25 'random' documents from Layer 1.
Checkpoint 03 - 750 USD of BTC = 40 'random' documents from Layer 1.
Checkpoint 04 - 1.000 USD of BTC = 50 'random' documents from Layer 1.
Layer_1.container - 5.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 1 Documents)
Checkpoint 05 - 6.500 USD of BTC = 50 'random' documents from Layer 2.
Checkpoint 06 - 8.500 USD of BTC = 50 'random' documents from Layer 2.
Checkpoint 07 - 12.000 USD of BTC = 50 'random' documents from Layer 2.
Checkpoint 08 - 25.000 USD of BTC = 50 'random' documents from Layer 2.
Layer_2.container - 50.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 2 Documents)
Checkpoint 09 - 65.000 USD of BTC = 100 'random' documents from Layer 3.
Checkpoint 10 - 85.000 USD of BTC = 100 'random' documents from Layer 3.
Layer_3.container - 100.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 2 Documents)
Checkpoint 11 - 250.000 USD of BTC = 250 'random' documents from Layer 4.
Checkpoint 12 - 500.000 USD of BTC = 250 'random' documents from Layer 4.
Layer_4.container - 1.000.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 4 Documents)
Checkpoint 13 - 1.500.000 USD of BTC = 5 'random' documents from Layer 5.
Layer_5.container - 2.000.000 USD of BTC (All Layer 5 Documents)
To clarify this structure, if we reach 10.000 USD of BTC, we'll release
the 'Layer_1.container' decryption key to the public via our official
Twitter. If another 90.000 USD of BTC is donated (for a total of 100.000
USD of BTC at this point), we'll release the decryption key for
'Layer_2.container' via our official Twitter, and so on. The
compensation is compounding structure, with the totals to be calculated
from the deposits into the BTC address time of their deposits.
We have a long history of trustworthy negotiations and resolutions with
many clients of ours. It's our goal to be financially compensated before
we initiate any brazen actions. You're motivated by your passions for
the truth, and we're motivated by our passion and love for Bitcoin.
Let's come to together and meet in the middle.

We've publicly released the archive of the 911 World Trade Center
Litigation documents publicly. There's thousands of files included in
the archive. Everyone can freely have a copy of the archive and we would
encourage it. However, the archive is completely encrypted using a very
strong AES encryption and very strong master keys that will prevent
anyone from decrypting the veracrypt containers until we publicly
release the keys for each layer. The archive is split between five
layers. Layer 1 being the most modest, and Layer 5 containing the most
heavy hitting and impactful documents, with Layer 2, Layer 3, and Layer
4 containing ever-increasingly scandalous materials. We encourage
everyone to obtain a copy of all five archives. As time goes on, we may
publicly release keys for each of these containers if our requests from
the involved companies are not met. The link to download the 10 GB
archive is below. Stay tuned for the possible release of more decryption
keys. We may release these keys on our new official Twitter page
( and/or on the dark web hacker forum 'KickAss'.
Below is the link to the torrent file to download the archive. The SHA1
Hash is calculated from '911_Archive.zip'.

And finally, a message to the companies directly involved to include the
airlines, government agencies, the dozens of solicitor firms, the
insurers, and the many others, this is a message directly to you: pay
the fuck up, or we're going to bury you with this. If you continue to
fail us, we'll escalate these releases by releasing the keys, each time
a Layer is opened, a new wave of liability will fall upon you. You know
our contact details.
You're welcome, heathens and what's the final lesson? When you're a
client of ours and you've accepted an agreement of ours: follow it to
the letter. We're not motivated by any political thoughts. We're not
hacktivists. We're motivated only by our pursuit of internet money

"9/11 Papers" MegaLeak - Layer 1 + Checkpoint 03, 04, 05, 06, & 07:
Cyber-Cash For Cyber-Cache
This is the thedarkoverlord here to deliver a message.
We're now calling this megaleak, the '9/11 Papers'. Keep giving us
cyber-cash for cyber-cache.
Hello, world. As you're well-aware, we designed a compensation plan that
would allow for the public crowd-funding of our organisation in order to
permit the public disclosure of our "9/11 Papers" in the interest of the
public. Part of this plan was to create a tiered escalation plan that
would result in multiple layers and milestones (which we're calling
checkpoints) to ensure the powers at be are being properly bent over a
barrel. We've said it before, and we'll say it again: we're financially
motivated, and you (the public) has spoken to us in our language
(internet money, specifically Bitcoin). Through voicing your
satisfaction by sending us 3.27 BTC for a total of over 12.000 USD of
BTC (at the time of writing), you've successfully unlocked Layer 1 as
well as Checkpoint 03, Checkpoint 04, Checkpoint 05, Checkpoint 06, and
Checkpoint 07. As with our previous paid releases, we've demonstrated to
you that we're honest about our intentions and we're transparent. As a
result of this most magnificent achievement, we're continuing to follow
the wishes of the public by releasing the Layers and Checkpoints we
promised you we would. Remember, continuing to fund our wallet will
continue to keep us motivated to help break the truth to the world by
open-sourcing what we're calling the "9/11 Papers". As such, let the
leaking continue:
Layer 1 = 500 Files
Checkpoint 05 = 50 Files
Checkpoint 06 = 50 Files
Checkpoint 07 = 50 Files
TOTAL = 650 Files

Instructions to decrypt the containers - Download Veracrypt and use the
decryption key above.
If you don't have our previously released 'Preview_Documents.container'
key, it is here:
*CZ4=I{YZ456zGecgg9/cCz|zNP5bZ,nCvJqDZKrq at v?O5V$FezCNs26CD;e:%N^
Transparency Disclaimer: Checkpoint 03 and Checkpoint 04 would have been
comprised of documents from Layer 1, but since the single donation
covered past Layer 1, we're releasing Layer 1 as an aggregate of itself
along with Checkpoint 03 and Checkpoint 04.
Let this serve as more definitive proof that what we're saying is true,
and that we're doing exactly as we promised you. Continue to keep the
bitcoins flowing, and we'll continue to keep the truth flowing.
Remember, Cyber-Cash for Cyber-Cache. We hope that there'll be more
releases. Continue to share these download links and decryption keys on
Reddit, 4chan, Steemit, Voat, your siblings, your friends, your pets,
and anyone else! We can't allow the mainstream media to silence the
truth any longer. We must ensure they're propaganda is crushed by the
truths we're dealing today.
Stay tuned on PasteBin for future announcements related to this leak.
We'll always sign all of our releases for verification of authenticity.

jews are race-mixed Afro-asiatic mongrels, the ones who aren't converts.
Hebrew is an Afro-asiatic language. And din't you know the true jews are
black israelites.
The majority of crimes in the US, Australia, and Europe are committed by
genetic Europeans because the majority of the population are genetic
Europeans. What kind of nigger-tier logic are you using. 'Per-capita' is
the measurement context you are looking for.

This is a message for the nation-state of the United States of America
and the greater deep-state.
We're going to continue to bend you over a barrel and fuck you if our
demands are not met. You know the score. Your censorship and fakenews
coverups won't silence this organisation or its public support. You were
warned. To all the other parties involved (airlines, litigation firms,
investigation firms, FBI, TSA, FAA, banks, security companies and more),
we're going to burn you down unless you begin to 'play ball'. This
entire situation will soon become far more tragick to your survival.
Make the right choise.
We're peeling these layers back like an onion. No one can save you
except for us. Pay the fuck up.
