As an alternative to the Tor Browser i suggest the following: On this site you can check your browser "visibility": I think with the JonDo Firefox profile ( and these addons it's not easy to fingerprint you:
- Adblock Edge
- BetterPrivacy
- CookieMonster
- Disconnect
- NoScript
- RequestPolicy
About a week i published an article about RequestPolicy on my IT security blog: RequestPolicy – Mehr Kontrolle beim Surfen
It explains some tracking and why RequestPolicy is a fine Firefox addon.
It's in german, but you can use Google Translate.
Best regards,
