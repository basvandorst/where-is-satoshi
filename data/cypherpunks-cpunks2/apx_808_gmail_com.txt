@_subject: Snowden and Compilers 
A few years ago some guys from Core security published a research were they
found laptop's BIOS with a tool called Computrace that supposedly was to
protect you if your computer was stolen, but contained a backdoor that
allowed remote access and code execution.
Computrace was installed in the BIOS for Notebooks of HP, Dell, Lenovo,
Toshiba, Gateway, Asus, Panasonic, and more.
No one can confirm it was the NSA yet... Snowden do you have something
about it in your collection?
Here is the paper

Tor node.
Shouldn't they have the node's private key too?
Just having the IP they would receive encrypted traffic, they wouldn't be
able to route it, your communication would fail and another TOR circuit
would be used.
