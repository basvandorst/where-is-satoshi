I couldn't say whether FreeBSD has as good an end user desktop experience, although I suspect it should, assuming your hardware supported.

This is direct quote from your first nasa link :  "While rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the air can be beneficial for plants, it is also the chief culprit of climate change. The gas, which traps heat in Earth’s atmosphere, has been increasing since the industrial age due to the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood for energy and is continuing to reach concentrations not seen in at least 500,000 years. The impacts of climate change include global warming, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and sea ice as well as more severe weather events."

This is direct quote from your first nasa link :  "While rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the air can be beneficial for plants, it is also the chief culprit of climate change. The gas, which traps heat in Earth’s atmosphere, has been increasing since the industrial age due to the burning of oil, gas, coal and wood for energy and is continuing to reach concentrations not seen in at least 500,000 years. The impacts of climate change include global warming, rising sea levels, melting glaciers and sea ice as well as more severe weather events."

Besides all the stuff already mentioned, some decent "anarchy

post-scarcity future, the "Culture" in question is definitely an
interesting take on anarchy. Large swaths of humanity populate the
galaxy, mostly living in enormous space stations (huge rotating
stanford torus-style rings). Benevolent AIs "watch over" humanity,
but anyone can choose to opt out and no one has to obey, although
obviously cooperation helps..  the books are great.
If you dig punk/hardcore, the band Propagandhi makes some great
shit. Their lyrics are all about freedom and the crimes of our
oppressors, and the lyrics are smart, the music is fucking great.
Less Talk, More Rock and Todays Empires, Tomorrows Ashes are both
fantastic. Although, they do get a little too precious about veganism

Not up to me my friend.

It's a UNIX system btw, well, redhat, running vsftpd, with a simple perl script I've written to trail the logs and blackhole anybody that looks nefarious. Kind of a very narrow fail2ban type thing...
For some reason I thought windows .scr files were bitmaps or pngs or something... Anyway, all I know is when I run "file Photo.scr" I get back "Win32 EXE.." or whatever the precise output is, I don't recall (typing this on a phone on the subway)

Right - the times I've invested in coins I always had reason beyond mere speculating and spent my balance quickly. I wish I'd had enough courage (and cash) to put some real money in BTC a long time ago and let it sit for a while...
There is some minor hassle in securely tumbling​ coins to really anonymize BTC as much as possible. I know there are a number of other competing blockchain currencies these days ; I don't know if this aspect is or can be handled "better" than is done in BTC. I literally don't know, having never done more than read the most cursory of info about any of the others ;)

True, and actually most times I've bought coins or portions of coins I've spent most of my balance in a very short time period after wards.
I'm not a "BTC speculator" and was jokingly bemoaning the fact that these sorts of people are potentially making a lot of money..... Unless they never sell off to see a profit and there is a problem (eg something like the mt gox fiasco affects them, or BTC value plummets for some reason..)
Considering the moderate hassle involved with tumbling coins for total anonymity, maybe one of the other blockchain currencies is better in this regard. I don't know enough about the alternatives to say.

variety hijacks the infected device's Windows clipboard, and
replaces bitcoin addresses as they're copy and pasted.
Trojan.Coinbitclip is the first instance of this new type of attack,

bitcoin address copied using the clipboard, and replaces it with one of
it's own, bypassing any protection from multi-signature and hardware
While clipboard hijacking is not a new concept, this is the first time
it has been found replacing bitcoin addresses."

Of course the future, one hopes, is in fusion. Not the LENR hoax bullshit, but the stuff they are researching at ITER in Europe.

So you don't waste all those KW accumulated during the day. Modern advanced batteries (like the ones sold by tesla) perform quite extraordinarily well.

I get that argument, but I think a person would end up saving far more money on their own electric bill if they didn't have to tap into the grid at night for their own juice. Effectively the batteries become the grid for this particular house, at night, when the sun is down ;)
And the less people tapping into the grid, the less carbon being burned at the other end....

Right - the times I've invested in coins I always had reason beyond mere speculating and spent my balance quickly. I wish I'd had enough courage (and cash) to put some real money in BTC a long time ago and let it sit for a while...
There is some minor hassle in securely tumbling​ coins to really anonymize BTC as much as possible. I know there are a number of other competing blockchain currencies these days ; I don't know if this aspect is or can be handled "better" than is done in BTC.

True, and actually most times I've bought coins or portions of coins I've spent most of my balance in a very short time period after wards.
I'm not a "BTC speculator" and was jokingly bemoaning the fact that these sorts of people are potentially making a lot of money..... Unless they never sell off to see a profit and there is a problem (eg something like the mt gox fiasco affects them, or BTC value plummets for some reason..)
Considering the moderate hassle involved with tumbling coins for total anonymity, maybe one of the other blockchain currencies is better in this regard. I don't know enough about the alternatives to say.

Or do you consider the internet so pwned that it doesnt matter? (although, why make it easier for them..)
I'm just curious... I started getting squeamish about it myself a

Sent: July 8, 2016 7:35:21 PM EDT
An open letter to security researchers and practitioners:
We need you to take a stand to protect security researchers who report
defects in browsers, before it's too late.
Earlier this month, the World Wide Web Consortium's Encrypted Media
Extensions (EME) spec progressed to Draft Recommendation phase. This is
a controversial standard for transmitting DRM-encumbered videos, and it
marks the very first time that the W3C has attempted to standardize a
DRM system.
This means that for the first time, W3C standards for browsers will fall
under laws like the DMCA (and its international equivalents, which the
US Trade Representative has spread all over the world). These laws allow
companies to threaten security researchers who disclose vulnerabilities
in DRM systems, on the grounds that these disclosures make it easier to
figure out how to bypass the DRM.
Last summer, the Copyright Office heard from security researchers about
the effect that DRM has on their work; those filings detail showstopper
bugs in consumer devices, cars, agricultural equipment, medical
implants, and voting machines that researchers felt they couldn't
readily publish about, lest they face punitive lawsuits from the
companies they embarrassed.
EFF has asked the W3C to take a minimal step to insulate their
stakeholders from the legal fallout from the inclusion of DRM in their
standards. Our proposal asks the W3C to bind its members to legal
promises not to use the DMCA or laws like it against security
researchers or implementers.
So far, the W3C executive has failed to act on this proposal, despite
diverse support from a number of W3C members.
We are hosting an open letter from security, privacy and technology
experts to the W3C's director, Tim Berners-Lee; and its CEO, Jeff Jaffe,
asking them to make any further work on EME contingent on adopting rules
to protect the open web from these bad laws.
Will you sign this letter? Some of security's leading lights have
already put their names to it. We can't afford to make widely used tools
like browsers off-limits to security research and disclosure, especially
not as HTML5 is being positioned as a UI environment to replace apps as
the primary way of interacting with sensors, actuators, embedded systems
and the whole Internet of Things.
If you're willing to sign on, please send an email to cory with

The first time I ever tried to install Linux was on a 286 in I think 1995 (I lagged on quality computers as a kid).
I downloaded the kernel source from a BBS at 9600 baud and got totally fucking confused with what to do with the resulting tgz file.... Eventually I was able to extract it in DOS, but of course it was still unusable... Linux needs 32bit and you can't install from a kernel source archive...
Anyway I got a Pentium 120 a year or two later and figured it out. Never really looked back. Used a lot of Solaris in late 90s as well - netras were reasonably cheap (are dirt cheap now)

Do any gmail users (which I've noticed there a lot of on the list,

is doing with access to your entire mail stream? They've publicly
stated users have no "reasonable expectation of privacy".  Do you use gmail for your main / private / important emails, in
addition to list correspondence?
Or do you consider the internet so pwned that it doesnt matter? (although, why make it easier for them..)
I'm just curious... I started getting squeamish about it myself a
good few years back, before snowden, just because it seems like an
obviously bad idea to house all my correspondence at the HQ of one
of the biggest corporations in the world, for them to play with, mine,
and cross-index for targeted advertising as they see fit..
Setting up your own mail server
(postfix+spamassasin+...clamav+..whatever) isn't really that hard,

Of course, you STILL don't control any of the switching or routing

Sent: July 8, 2016 7:35:21 PM EDT
An open letter to security researchers and practitioners:
We need you to take a stand to protect security researchers who report
defects in browsers, before it's too late.
Earlier this month, the World Wide Web Consortium's Encrypted Media
Extensions (EME) spec progressed to Draft Recommendation phase. This is
a controversial standard for transmitting DRM-encumbered videos, and it
marks the very first time that the W3C has attempted to standardize a
DRM system.
This means that for the first time, W3C standards for browsers will fall
under laws like the DMCA (and its international equivalents, which the
US Trade Representative has spread all over the world). These laws allow
companies to threaten security researchers who disclose vulnerabilities
in DRM systems, on the grounds that these disclosures make it easier to
figure out how to bypass the DRM.
Last summer, the Copyright Office heard from security researchers about
the effect that DRM has on their work; those filings detail showstopper
bugs in consumer devices, cars, agricultural equipment, medical
implants, and voting machines that researchers felt they couldn't
readily publish about, lest they face punitive lawsuits from the
companies they embarrassed.
EFF has asked the W3C to take a minimal step to insulate their
stakeholders from the legal fallout from the inclusion of DRM in their
standards. Our proposal asks the W3C to bind its members to legal
promises not to use the DMCA or laws like it against security
researchers or implementers.
So far, the W3C executive has failed to act on this proposal, despite
diverse support from a number of W3C members.
We are hosting an open letter from security, privacy and technology
experts to the W3C's director, Tim Berners-Lee; and its CEO, Jeff Jaffe,
asking them to make any further work on EME contingent on adopting rules
to protect the open web from these bad laws.
Will you sign this letter? Some of security's leading lights have
already put their names to it. We can't afford to make widely used tools
like browsers off-limits to security research and disclosure, especially
not as HTML5 is being positioned as a UI environment to replace apps as
the primary way of interacting with sensors, actuators, embedded systems
and the whole Internet of Things.
If you're willing to sign on, please send an email to cory at eff.org with
your country of residence and your institutional affiliation (if any).

  2. BY SHARING ENCRYPTED FILES in the Keybase filesystem [3]. Just drop
files in a folder with you and _username at service_, such as

Depending on which phone you have and which ROM you flash onto it,
you can get an Android phone that is -mostly- independent of the
Google ecosystem - an independent app store (F-droid), firefox as
the browser, different mail clients (k-9, etc)…. different EVERYTHING,
basically, but the core system for managing the UI, and connecting
to networks/making calls/etc.  I mean, yes, you are still running google code at the core of the thing - but you can get some distance.
E.g. -
Over the years I’ve played with dozens of ROMs on a handful of
different android phones… its fun screwing around with them.

Do any gmail users (which I've noticed there a lot of on the list,

is doing with access to your entire mail stream? They've publicly
stated users have no "reasonable expectation of privacy".  Do you use gmail for your main / private / important emails, in
addition to list correspondence?
Or do you consider the internet so pwned that it doesnt matter? (although, why make it easier for them..)
I'm just curious... I started getting squeamish about it myself a
good few years back, before snowden, just because it seems like an
obviously bad idea to house all my correspondence at the HQ of one
of the biggest corporations in the world, for them to play with, mine,
and cross-index for targeted advertising as they see fit..
Setting up your own mail server
(postfix+spamassasin+...clamav+..whatever) isn't really that hard,
although you gotta pay a hosting fee, depending on how you decide

Sent: July 8, 2016 7:35:21 PM EDT
An open letter to security researchers and practitioners:
We need you to take a stand to protect security researchers who report
defects in browsers, before it's too late.
Earlier this month, the World Wide Web Consortium's Encrypted Media
Extensions (EME) spec progressed to Draft Recommendation phase. This is
a controversial standard for transmitting DRM-encumbered videos, and it
marks the very first time that the W3C has attempted to standardize a
DRM system.
This means that for the first time, W3C standards for browsers will fall
under laws like the DMCA (and its international equivalents, which the
US Trade Representative has spread all over the world). These laws allow
companies to threaten security researchers who disclose vulnerabilities
in DRM systems, on the grounds that these disclosures make it easier to
figure out how to bypass the DRM.
Last summer, the Copyright Office heard from security researchers about
the effect that DRM has on their work; those filings detail showstopper
bugs in consumer devices, cars, agricultural equipment, medical
implants, and voting machines that researchers felt they couldn't
readily publish about, lest they face punitive lawsuits from the
companies they embarrassed.
EFF has asked the W3C to take a minimal step to insulate their
stakeholders from the legal fallout from the inclusion of DRM in their
standards. Our proposal asks the W3C to bind its members to legal
promises not to use the DMCA or laws like it against security
researchers or implementers.
So far, the W3C executive has failed to act on this proposal, despite
diverse support from a number of W3C members.
We are hosting an open letter from security, privacy and technology
experts to the W3C's director, Tim Berners-Lee; and its CEO, Jeff Jaffe,
asking them to make any further work on EME contingent on adopting rules
to protect the open web from these bad laws.
Will you sign this letter? Some of security's leading lights have
already put their names to it. We can't afford to make widely used tools
like browsers off-limits to security research and disclosure, especially
not as HTML5 is being positioned as a UI environment to replace apps as
the primary way of interacting with sensors, actuators, embedded systems
and the whole Internet of Things.
If you're willing to sign on, please send an email to cory at eff.org with
your country of residence and your institutional affiliation (if any).

  2. BY SHARING ENCRYPTED FILES in the Keybase filesystem [3]. Just drop
files in a folder with you and _username at service_, such as

It's an android app (and Windows/OS X/Linux), the successor to Xbmc. it's actually really fucking impressive, after you've installed the right 3rd party plugins.
None of the Amazon shit really comes into it, besides paying $40 for something that probably cost $50 to manufacture.
Actually, people were building raspberry pi Kodi boxes (and surely still are) before this super cheap and simple solution arrived.

Very reminescent of Gibson's sprawl stuff, except the central conceit
is that Western society has collapsed and the Islamic countries
have come to dominance. Its been a while since I've read them, and
obviously they are just as dated as Neuromancer, but I think the

Depending on which phone you have and which ROM you flash onto it,
you can get an Android phone that is -mostly- independent of the
Google ecosystem - an independent app store (F-droid), firefox as
the browser, different mail clients (k-9, etc)…. different EVERYTHING,
basically, but the core system for managing the UI, and connecting
to networks/making calls/etc.  I mean, yes, you are still running google code at the core of the thing - but you can get some distance.
E.g. -
Over the years I’ve played with dozens of ROMs on a handful of
different android phones… its fun screwing around with them.
I’ve gotta keep an iPhone for work, and honestly the iPhone 5s looks
like a piece of fucking junk compared to my nexus 6.

I don't think Zen's point can be stressed enough... There is literally so much out there, if you really want to learn something well it's important to develop a little tunnel vision, verging on myopia, until you have sufficient mastery... At which point you can branch back out to a broad view and see how your new understanding of  informs future research & learning endeavors...

Acknowledging that science is real, and that I don't know EVERYTHING
(something you are wholly incapable of doing) is not the same thing
as being ... whatever the fuck you are trying to describe. Your
description bears zero resemblance to myself, or to most of
the people you've put it to. And it does get repetitive, watching

Oh, I see. You have a remarkable ability to distinguish amongst and identify different types of fascists. It's good to know someone is keeping Argentina pure. (lol)
And you're just a cunt, but I don't need to say it 13 times per message =).  You simply ignore Russian fascism - you just said so. You give it a pass. It doesn't bother you in the least.
I'm not pro any nation state. I don't give Russia or America a pass. Again, you argue like a child, so I'm indulging you like a child.  I said :
science is real. I don't know everything.
And I implied there have been useful advances from university level sciences.
I realize your chihuahua sized brain has problems with complex thoughts, but I wonder what part of that counts as cheerleading?
Yep, you are completely full of shit Juan....
There is a difference between censorship and a moderated technical mailing list. Kind of like no sane person would give you commit privs to any source code, anywhere. The idea that an individual list admin's agency, in the configuration of their own software, is dictated by Juan and his central committee - that's fascism. But Ive pointed this out to you before.

Absolutely correct. I find it fascinating that so many otherwise sensible atheists still think there was a historical Jesus....
We know there was no Jewish exodus from archaeological records, there was in fact no united kingdom of Israel in the 10th century BC anything like the bible purports. It's all Jewish propaganda after the fact.
I don't know why the life of Jesus is taken any more seriously.

Bostrum (the simulation hypothesis guy) has some interesting thoughts on the future of humanity that basically boil down to a few possibilities, one of which is humanity locking itself (forever) into some sort of totalitarian dystopia similar to what you outline. Fundamentally I think this is the same thing as destroying ourselves outright.

Does anyone actually believe Trump is anything but a bloviating gasbag who told the racist hordes in America what they wanted to hear? Does he even believe his own bullshit - does any politician? I see no reason to celebrate Trump, just as I would see no reason to celebrate Hillary.
Acting as if her corruption is anything special or particularly out of line is just a farce. Just like all of American politics.

The history of American politics is a wretched piece of surreal theatre.... Americans laboring under the illusion of freedom at home while every murderous trick is taken by government in cahoots with industry to maximize profits for the oligarchic elite. The Dulles brothers set the template in Guatemala...
Trump promises a return to a time (the post ww2 boom in America) when America profited in particular off the fact that most of the rest of the developed world had been bombed to shit, its industry destroyed. It's a nice con, and I'm quite sure he will do everything in his considerable power to enrich himself, his class, and his cronies, but I wonder what Joe Dumbshit will think when those factory jobs DON'T come back....

Yes, drug prohibition creates the black markets that creates the wildly

structures. It's a ridiculous failed policy that has never made sense,
and something I've never been able to wrap my head around as to why the
average person would even a.) give a shit what I (or anyone) puts in

prohibition and the fucking massive violent crime it creates.....
Its fucking crazy man.  And yes I could totally imagine people like
Shorty Guzman having a vested interest in keeping drugs prohibition
alive....  the amount of marijuana coming from south of the border has
gone down dramatically in the past few years, cuz of all the states
where it is legal or decriminalized, and the quality of the bud from

Although I have not a single fucking clue what David Duke has to do even tangentially with the purported purpose of this list, I read a small portion of the transcript, just to the part where he starts blathering his line about preserving the European values of America. Just the same way the Europeans were so concerned with preserving the native culture of the Americas starting with that very first asshole Colombus who enslaved countless natives in the West Indies.... And so it went, and continues, since 1492. I find it fucking hilarious that you buy into David Dukes line of shit, and then write a screed about MSM programming.

Heavy abuse of alcohol is just as destructive as heavy use of any other drug. For people that want help, I totally support it. Said "crackhead" would have far less negative societal impact if drugs were legal and cheap. And even assuming he does run half crazy and get himself in trouble for theft - I still don't support the government mandating what said "crackhead" can put into his own body. It's none of my business, it's none of your business, it sure as fuck isn't big brothers business. Your whole description and line of reasoning reeks of reefer madness style bullshit - no pun intended.

Also - I think it’s obvious that if drugs prohibition stopped, there
would be a transition from JAILS to prevention, support, and recovery
services. It could even be subsidized by the “state” which you are
so worried about covering incarceration costs!  Same with aids
transmission.  Free works for everyone, free narcan spray for all
junkies, detox and recovery services subsidized at a fraction of
the cost we pay the pigs, the courts, and the prisons.
All your hyperbole about “no life caring aids transmuting ass”  is

LOL. Amusing.. umm.. anecdote about Owsley :)  MDMA was first synthesized by Merck I think early 20th century.
Alexander Shulgin definitely tried it in the 70s. He has a whole book
that came out a while later about all the dope he cooked up and tried on
himself with his schedule 1 DEA license (he could "legally" cook
anything he wanted up, and he _was_ a trained chemist).
I was being flippant with my MDMA remark anyway ;) Although I think it
does compare favorably to most other drugs.. pot is definitely more benign
than ecstacy, but I don't really consider pot a drug. Also, and I don't
really want to get off in the weeds here too much, but you can buy MDMA
test kits pretty cheap, and use sites like pillreports, etc.

Then you're either woefully stupid or willfully blind to a few issues - say, the mass incarceration of drug offenders in the American gulag, and the huge amount of violence the black markets have created in Central/South America. I could go on, but it's clear you don't give a shit (in other words you lack basic human compassion).
So what exactly is your point? You've just established that effectively there is no ld50 for pot. How does that make it compare to alcohol unfavorably?

Alcohol is a drug. Surely you realize this. More importantly, the relative dangers of one drug (alcohol, the kind you like) and all the others (including pot, the one you've kept moronically trying to make the case for being more dangerous than alcohol) has nothing to do with the effectiveness of the terror campaign known as the "war on drugs".
The idiocy of your assertion makes it hard to parse. Maybe you were drunk when you typed it up.
I notice you snipped out all the other bullshit you kept pressing before about "eat a half gram and find out".  I guess you realize how asinine that bit was. Anyway, to assert alcohol is safer than marijuana is just totally wrong, and goes against all know medical evidence. Any other comparison is purely subjective, as surely you know (i.e. you like to get drunk, but when you smoke pot it makes you freak out like a little girl)
No one gives a fuck how you drink, pal =) Yeah, you're one hip dude =).  I find your moronic outlook grating, but, sadly, I'm sure it lines up nicely with a large swath of self righteous hypocrites who want to enjoy their booze in peace, but lock anyone who smokes a joint up.
Although... you're actually becoming more of an outlier, at least when it comes to marijuana - legalization is sweeping the country. I'm sure you'd piss your pants in happiness (as drunken morons are wont to do) if the feds start cracking down on it with the new administration.

It isn't nearly the revelatory experience you seem to think. Most pot heads I know have accidentally overdosed on an oral dose before - you get real fucking stoned. For about 12 hours.

Yes, drug prohibition creates the black markets that creates the wildly
inflated prices that attracts the narco mafias and other organized crime
structures. It's a ridiculous failed policy that has never made sense,
and something I've never been able to wrap my head around as to why the
average person would even a.) give a shit what I (or anyone) puts in
their own body and b.) NOT understand the correlation between drugs
prohibition and the fucking massive violent crime it creates.....
Its fucking crazy man.  And yes I could totally imagine people like
Shorty Guzman having a vested interest in keeping drugs prohibition
alive....  the amount of marijuana coming from south of the border has
gone down dramatically in the past few years, cuz of all the states
where it is legal or decriminalized, and the quality of the bud from
said states being SO much superior to the shit from mexico.

Although I have not a single fucking clue what David Duke has to do even tangentially with the purported purpose of this list, I read a small portion of the transcript, just to the part where he starts blathering his line about preserving the European values of America. Just the same way the Europeans were so concerned with preserving the native culture of the Americas starting with that very first asshole Colombus who enslaved countless natives in the West Indies.... And so it went, and continues, since 1492. I find it fucking hilarious that you buy into David Dukes line of shit, and then write a screed about MSM programming.

Heavy abuse of alcohol is just as destructive as heavy use of any other drug. For people that want help, I totally support it. Said "crackhead" would have far less negative societal impact if drugs were legal and cheap. And even assuming he does run half crazy and get himself in trouble for theft - I still don't support the government mandating what said "crackhead" can put into his own body. It's none of my business, it's none of your business, it sure as fuck isn't big brothers business.

Also - I think it’s obvious that if drugs prohibition stopped, there
would be a transition from JAILS to prevention, support, and recovery
services. It could even be subsidized by the “state” which you are
so worried about covering incarceration costs!  Same with aids
transmission.  Free works for everyone, free narcan spray for all
junkies, detox and recovery services subsidized at a fraction of
the cost we pay the pigs, the courts, and the prisons.

LOL. Amusing.. umm.. anecdote about Owsley :)  MDMA was first synthesized by Merck I think early 20th century.
Alexander Shulgin definitely tried it in the 70s. He has a whole book
that came out a while later about all the dope he cooked up and tried on
himself with his schedule 1 DEA license (he could "legally" cook
anything he wanted up, and he _was_ a trained chemist).
I was being flippant with my MDMA remark anyway ;) Although I think it
does compare favorably to most other drugs.. pot is definitely more benign
than ecstacy, but I don't really consider pot a drug. Also, and I don't
really want to get off in the weeds here too much, but you can buy MDMA
test kits pretty cheap, and use sites like pillreports, etc.

Alcohol is a drug. Surely you realize this. More importantly, the relative dangers of one drug (alcohol, the kind you like) and all the others (including pot, the one you've kept moronically trying to make the case for being more dangerous than alcohol) has nothing to do with the effectiveness of the terror campaign known as the "war on drugs".
The idiocy of your assertion makes it hard to parse. Maybe you were drunk when you typed it up.
I notice you snipped out all the other bullshit you kept pressing before about "eat a half gram and find out".  I guess you realize how asinine that bit was. Anyway, to assert alcohol is safer than marijuana is just totally wrong, and goes against all know medical evidence. Any other comparison is purely subjective, as surely you know (i.e. you like to get drunk, but when you smoke pot it makes you freak out like a little girl)
No one gives a fuck how you drink, pal =) Yeah, you're one hip dude =).  I find your moronic outlook grating, but, sadly, I'm sure it lines up nicely with a large swath of self righteous hypocrites who want to enjoy their booze in peace, but lock anyone who smokes a joint up.
Although... you're actually becoming more of an outlier, at least when it comes to marijuana - legalization is sweeping the country. I'm sure you'd piss your pants in happiness (as drunken morons are wont to do) if the feds start cracking down on it with the new administration.

That’s the only good question you’ve asked. I don’t know the answer - I suspect I’ll be mulling that over for a (little) while. I have met a few interesting people on the list, some good book suggestions.. it hasn’t been all bad.

I do agree both countries are shit or "every one is bad", in most other important areas. E.g. the nations are each fucked up militaristic murderous entities, run by a small cabal of elites more interested in money and power than peace or the welfare of their people and the world.

Man, I’m not going to debate climate change with you, its a fucking stupid waste of time. If you honestly don’t believe in science that’s a problem you need to solve on your own. You’ll get there, give it
some time.
That’s the only good question you’ve asked. I don’t know the answer - I suspect I’ll be mulling that over for a (little) while. I have met a few interesting people on the list, some good book suggestions.. it hasn’t been all bad.
In other words - you don’t know the first thing about the technical aspects
of it, so its of no interest to you. It’s hardly a variety. The shit makes up 90% of the posts. It’s a big fucking
circle jerk between Zen, Alex and, to a lesser degree, yourself.

Its technical discussion that doesn’t interest you, so you call it "useless
talk". I think we are agreed on this - you are bored by purely technical discussions.  This doesn’t make the crypto list inherently flawed. It’s
just not for YOU, which is appropriate, since you likely can’t follow the discussions anyway.
My apologies on this one. I have seen Zen and Alex give you props
only about a fucking million times, but apparently its not a two way
street. You don’t actively support the fucking torrent of Russian bullshit,
but you mostly don’t say shit about it either. So consider yourself out of the circle jerk if that makes you feel better. And, no, don’t bother to quote yourself…. your inane, vicious, vulgar bullshit is generally not worth repeating.

You really think there has been nothing learned or advanced on the crypto list?  You must follow it REAL fucking close for something you despise so much.
I've never seen you make any interesting technical points, about tor or anything else. When it comes to tor you're like a fucking broken IRC bot, spouting the SAME SHIT WE ALL KNOW, over and over and over. Everyone knows where it is funded, how it was started, and that it is insecure against a GPA.
Tell me something I don't know, that you haven't repeated ad infinitum, like a fucking over excited child.
No, I think it's because you have nothing interesting to say on the list. I've seen your posts, they are not technical in nature. You don't have to be such a defensive ass about it, but hey, you think climate change is a hoax too, so I'd say you are basically a fucking lost cause at this point.
With people like yourself, it isn't hard to imagine why the list is moderated. There are different lists for different purposes. You don't get to dictate how the individual admins configure their software. That would hardly be in line with your ideals, would it? All mailman configuration pushed down on high from the central committee ?  Give me a fucking break man.
You're a gullible clown if you actually believe that.

OBVIOUSLY the answer is no. I have zero faith in America or the corrupt oligarchy which runs it. Likewise, I have just as little faith in Russia and Putin, an EQUALLY corrupt and despotic oligarchy. Or perhaps kleptocracy is a better term for Russia - the words don't really matter, it's all a variation on a theme. I don't believe in EITHER system, or any of the established nation states as legitime actors in good faith on the so called global stage. You, on the other hand, are an unabashed apologist for Putin and Russia. You practically blare Pravda all over the list with the crap pro-Russian links you constantly send. As someone else on the list said recently : it's propaganda bullshit and it's embarrassing.

@_subject: 4096 bit SSL keys 
Speaking within the context of https SSL certs, is there any real value to a key/cert above 2048 bits?
The reason I asked: updating a few certs at office recently I nuked an older F5 LTM device by installing a 4096 bit key/cert pair - the load on the appliance (Linux based) shot up from less than 1 to about 30 and became so excruciatingly slow it was nearly impossible to back the change out (web GUI and ssh were both nearly non-responsive)..
On modern hardware, including modern F5s, this problem doesn't exist... but from what reading I've done it seems 4096 buys you very little anyway ?
With a theoretical quantum computer attacking is there any significant gain with the bigger key size?
Curious what others think....

@_subject: 4096 bit SSL keys 
I /think/ the explanation to why the load went SO fucking crazy with the
new cert/key combo is this particularly old F5 (a 3400) has some sort of silicon dedicated to 2048 decrypts, where-as the 4096 is done completely in software… but I’m not sure. It was Friday, and I
didn’t (and haven’t) dug back into it at all since getting it fixed.
Also, while the load did peak around 30, the actual jump was from about
0.8 to a range between 10 and 30.  It probably stayed closer to 20 until
I got everything reverted (updated the client ssl profiles, removed the
4096 bit cert/key, restored the two VIPs I had updated to using the
2048 bit certs..) Regardless, this particular machine did not handle high load well … I was lucky I had an established ssh session in, the
web gui just became completely fucked, and even my ssh session
was barely usable. The newer models work much better, and in fact
I had installed about a dozen 4096-bit certs for some VIPs on a 3600,
and the load didn’t jump at all.
Thanks for the response… great info!

At least you can easily build your entire user land and kernel (and ports) on FreeBSD. It's very straight forward compared to Linux distros (Gentoo/arch some what excluded I guess).  I suppose this isn't much consolation if you're worried about the upstream svn repo itself..... Generally I trust that svn updates are not pulling down back doored code. I don't have the time (or the capacity) to read though all of /usr/src....
Trying to use ports built from source along side prebuilt binaries from pkg is a complete fucking nightmare on FreeBSD.  I routinely have to hack the pkg SQLite db file to make pkg audits reflect the actual state of my system. Need to invest some time in poudriere....

Actually, I am talking about stuff out of /usr/ports. What has gotten
my system kind of fucked up is changing default options (running make
config in the port and tweaking something). After building and running
make install it is "converted" to a pkg but it no longer matches up
with the binary builds distributed by FreeBSD because I screwed with
the options... Additionally, "pkg audit" gives me bizarre results sometimes, e.g.
"perl5.16 is EOL"... well, yes perl5.16 is installed on my system, but
so is perl5.20 (which is the default). And the problem is there is
no longer a /usr/ports/lang/perl5.16 to run "make uninstall", and
trying to remove it with "pkg remove perl5.16" attempts to wipe out
ALL SORTS of stuff that has no actual dependency on this deprecated
version of perl which I have chmod -x'd.
So, I leave the mode 0000 /usr/local/bin/perl5.16 and delete the
package entry for it out of /var/db/pkg/local.sqlite. Quite ugly I
Anyway, its mainly a hobby server for me, so I don't mind just
building everything from source. I have plans to start it over using
poudriere from the beginning (this was the first time I have revisited
FreeBSD in 10 years or so..).

corrupt/cowardly/disgusting US cops that have been caught on phone

otherwise been covered up.

Hmm..  if you really look at “the big picture” here, and imagine
an America that never had African slaves, I doubt the south would’ve
had any substantial wealth to lose. Certainly nothing like it was.
The USA was able to progress very quickly on the back of slave
labor.  Fucking country was built on the back of slavery.  Who knows
what would would have happened in North America if there had never
been the (despicable) expedient of cheap, African slaves….
But these are all just games in alternate history at this point.
You can take the magnifying glass for the “big picture” as close

I don't believe in EITHER system, or any of the established nation states as legitime actors in good faith on the so called global stage.

@_subject: 4096 bit SSL keys 
Speaking within the context of https SSL certs, is there any real value to a key/cert above 2048 bits?
The reason I asked: updating a few certs at office recently I nuked an older F5 LTM device by installing a 4096 bit key/cert pair - the load on the appliance (Linux based) shot up from less than 1 to about 30 and became so excruciatingly slow it was nearly impossible to back the change out (web GUI and ssh were both nearly non-responsive)..
On modern hardware, including modern F5s, this problem doesn't exist... but from what reading I've done it seems 4096 buys you very little anyway ?
With a theoretical quantum computer attacking is there any significant gain with the bigger key size?
Curious what others think....

@_subject: 4096 bit SSL keys 
I /think/ the explanation to why the load went SO fucking crazy with the
new cert/key combo is this particularly old F5 (a 3400) has some sort of silicon dedicated to 2048 decrypts, where-as the 4096 is done completely in software… but I’m not sure. It was Friday, and I
didn’t (and haven’t) dug back into it at all since getting it fixed.
Also, while the load did peak around 30, the actual jump was from about
0.8 to a range between 10 and 30.  It probably stayed closer to 20 until
I got everything reverted (updated the client ssl profiles, removed the
4096 bit cert/key, restored the two VIPs I had updated to using the
2048 bit certs..) Regardless, this particular machine did not handle high load well … I was lucky I had an established ssh session in, the
web gui just became completely fucked, and even my ssh session
was barely usable. The newer models work much better, and in fact
I had installed about a dozen 4096-bit certs for some VIPs on a 3600,
and the load didn’t jump at all.
Thanks for the response… great info!

At least you can easily build your entire user land and kernel (and ports) on FreeBSD. It's very straight forward compared to Linux distros (Gentoo/arch some what excluded I guess).  I suppose this isn't much consolation if you're worried about the upstream svn repo itself..... Generally I trust that svn updates are not pulling down back doored code. I don't have the time (or the capacity) to read though all of /usr/src....

Actually, I am talking about stuff out of /usr/ports. What has gotten
my system kind of fucked up is changing default options (running make
config in the port and tweaking something). After building and running
make install it is "converted" to a pkg but it no longer matches up
with the binary builds distributed by FreeBSD because I screwed with
the options... Additionally, "pkg audit" gives me bizarre results sometimes, e.g.
"perl5.16 is EOL"... well, yes perl5.16 is installed on my system, but
so is perl5.20 (which is the default). And the problem is there is
no longer a /usr/ports/lang/perl5.16 to run "make uninstall", and
trying to remove it with "pkg remove perl5.16" attempts to wipe out
ALL SORTS of stuff that has no actual dependency on this deprecated
version of perl which I have chmod -x'd.
So, I leave the mode 0000 /usr/local/bin/perl5.16 and delete the
package entry for it out of /var/db/pkg/local.sqlite. Quite ugly I
Anyway, its mainly a hobby server for me, so I don't mind just
building everything from source. I have plans to start it over using
poudriere from the beginning (this was the first time I have revisited
FreeBSD in 10 years or so..).

Hmm..  if you really look at “the big picture” here, and imagine
an America that never had African slaves, I doubt the south would’ve
had any substantial wealth to lose. Certainly nothing like it was.
The USA was able to progress very quickly on the back of slave
labor.  Fucking country was built on the back of slavery.  Who knows
what would would have happened in North America if there had never
been the (despicable) expedient of cheap, African slaves….
But these are all just games in alternate history at this point.
You can take the magnifying glass for the “big picture” as close

Basically, iOS has a "feature" that deliberately slows down

here is obvious - get you to upgrade to the latest & "greatest",
because damn the current model is really starting to feel
it's age... Of course they never publicized that they were doing
this or that a far cheaper battery replacement would restore
performance, a trade off that no doubt many users would've made rather than shell out for a whole new model they don't
really need.

on folding proteins, on SETI, etc)...
Burning carbon to generate wattage simply for the purpose of proving work generating hashes, without doing anything useful, seems like an awful waste. We are baking
the earth quickly enough, aren't we?
Are there are any digital currencies working in this direction? Is it even feasible?  I take only a mild interest in Bitcoin having sold (used, actually) a number of coins at $400-$600 a couple years

I agree, Wikipedia is badly skewed on this, but it seems like they are probably just following conventional thought on the issue. Which I feel
is coming around to be more widely accepted that there was no Jesus
as described in the gospels that started the early Christian church (though
it was a common Jewish name - Yeshua - at that time in history, and there are a few other Yeshuas with messianic delusions described in
the talmud from around the same time).
They do have a “historicity of jesus” page, which at least has the following info -
More recently Richard Carrier argues in his book On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt, that there is insufficient Bayesian probability, that is evidence, to believe in the existence of Jesus. Furthermore, he argues that the Jesus figure was probably originally known only through private revelations and hidden messages in scripture which were then crafted into a historical figure, to communicate the claims of the gospels allegorically. These allegories then started to be believed as fact during the struggle for control of the Christian churches of the 1st century.[106] Philip R. Davies has opined that a recognition that the historicity of Jesus is not entirely certain would nudge Jesus scholarship towards academic respectability[103] and R. Joseph Hoffmann at the Jesus Project noted that Jesus is getting more vague, ambiguous, and uncertain the more scholars study him, rather than the other way around.[116

I don't get James Donald's email, so I can only reply indirectly: show me the evidence. There is contemporary evidence
of the existence of Pontius Pilate... There is *no contemporary* evidence for Jesus. Even if you consider Josephus a contemporary, which he isn't, it is widely accepted that the
few lines  "he scribbled" on Jesus are a much later
interpolation, a forgery done by some devout
who was embarrassed at the paucity of evidence for the
messiah. As for Tacitus - he was writing at an even later

mentions Christus is not a forgery, its simply the case of
him repeating propaganda he had heard from early Christians themselves. And thats it! I won't bother to
mention the gospels themselves, which are hilariously
contradictory, all written far too late, and obviously a bunch
of religious propaganda filled with mystical nonsense.
Also, it's funny hearing someone like James Donald opine on fact. This is not a man to be trusted on anything factual. James Donald knows fuck all about fact from fiction, and gleefully picks and chooses which is which, to suit his own fucked up and disgusting ideology.

Interesting. I always bought coins directly from a guy who was happy
to take my money, at a cost to me only slightly above TX fee, and
send coin straight to my wallet(s). The whole concept of the KYC
requirements of all the major online exchange sites seemed both
antithetical to BTC and dangerous. I was always wary of tumbling
the coins for anonymity, and stopped screwing around with it when
I lost easy access to my point of contact that would do direct coin

All women are like that
December 27th, 2017
Women are attracted to arrogant violent men. They are attracted to IQ<80
criminals because criminals are allowed to be violent, while high status
males are not, with the result that the status hierarchy as perceived by
women winds up upside down from the status hierarchy as perceived by
men. AWALT. All women are like that. When people say that not all women
are like that, NAWALT, it is like aging fat feminists saying that
different men have different types so you can't say one type of beauty
overrules the others. Not so: Men want to fuck young, beautiful and
fertile women. Women want to fuck arrogant, violent, criminal men. That
is all there is to it. We may nuance after accepting that, but only
after accepting that. Brad Pitt got horribly burned. Einstein wound up
with a KGB girl friend who cared more about Stalin than Einstein.
Feynman needed to learn game, put on an asshole persona, did pretty much
what I am doing. If not all women were like that, these famous men would
have done better. Feynman scored, I scored, but if General Butt Naked
had shown up, wearing a necklace of human eyeballs, an AK47, and nothing
else, we would have been shit out of luck. All women react to the same
stimuli in the same way. It is just a matter of which stimuli they get
exposed to. If Feynman cannot score merely being brilliant, famous, and
admired, Brad Pitt gets burned despite being rich, famous, and handsome,
Einstein winds up having sex with the KGB and serving as a communist
loudspeaker, then all women are like that. The lioness knows which lion
to fuck, because she sees him killing her kittens. To align the crude,
cruel, simplistic, vicious, and brutal female perception of the male
status hierarchy with the subtle, complex, multidimensional, and nuanced
reality of the male status hierarchy as actually organized by males, we
need to legalize and socially support domestic discipline by taxpaying
husbands and fathers, also husbands and fathers that are members of the
military, the police, rentacops, and mercenaries. (McLintock), and back
that discipline with conspicuously public state violence. We also need
to make it legal to use violence on men who come sniffing round your
women, as the law was under King Solomon. Then hypergamy will be
eugenic, rather than dysgenic. Right now, hypergamy is massively
dysgenic. Hence the character I play when interacting with fertile age
Women have a primitive concept of power. And we men are all dancing
monkeys. So, the thing we are forced to do is to become powerful as
women understand power.
Which unfortunately is anti civilizational and counter civilizational.
Hence the need to modify civilization so that high status males get to
perform more private violence. It is easier to have more private
policing, to make male status hierarchies more convincing to women, than
it is to make women have sex with the men that they should, and refrain
from having sex with the men that they should not.
When affluent respectable middle class white males beat misbehaving
daughters and wives, and receive any necessary public assistance in so
doing from police and authorities, while low lives do not receive
similar assistance, then IQ<80 criminals will stop being so strangely
attractive to women, and the guy in the corner office will find himself
receiving hot letters from women he has never met. But that said, women
are quite agreeable to being made to have sex. They prefer it that way.
Resistance is a shit test, and they are turned on by being overpowered.
So we need to make it the law that the man that they should have sex
with, their husband, the father of their children, gets to overpower

Basically, iOS has a "feature" that deliberately slows down
the phone based on the age of the battery. Apple's incentive
here is obvious - get you to upgrade to the latest & "greatest",
because damn the current model is really starting to feel
it's age... Of course they never publicized that they were doing
this or that a far cheaper battery replacement would restore
performance, a trade off that no doubt many users would've made rather than shell out for a whole new model they don't
really need.

A brief point... The whole proof of work calculation that is done
in the process of Bitcoin activity would be far more interesting if it did something useful. I suppose this is much easier said than done - how do you precisely quantify "useful work" (eg crunching data on the genome,
on folding proteins, on SETI, etc)...
Burning carbon to generate wattage simply for the purpose of proving work generating hashes, without doing anything useful, seems like an awful waste. We are baking
the earth quickly enough, aren't we?
Are there are any digital currencies working in this direction? Is it even feasible?  I take only a mild interest in Bitcoin having sold (used, actually) a number of coins at $400-$600 a couple years
ago and feeling foolish now, but I also recognize the
environmental problem.

I agree, Wikipedia is badly skewed on this, but it seems like they are probably just following conventional thought on the issue. Which I feel
is coming around to be more widely accepted that there was no Jesus
as described in the gospels that started the early Christian church (though
it was a common Jewish name - Yeshua - at that time in history, and there are a few other Yeshuas with messianic delusions described in
the talmud from around the same time).
They do have a “historicity of jesus” page, which at least has the following info -
More recently Richard Carrier argues in his book On the Historicity of Jesus: Why We Might Have Reason for Doubt, that there is insufficient Bayesian probability, that is evidence, to believe in the existence of Jesus. Furthermore, he argues that the Jesus figure was probably originally known only through private revelations and hidden messages in scripture which were then crafted into a historical figure, to communicate the claims of the gospels allegorically. These allegories then started to be believed as fact during the struggle for control of the Christian churches of the 1st century.[106] Philip R. Davies has opined that a recognition that the historicity of Jesus is not entirely certain would nudge Jesus scholarship towards academic respectability[103] and R. Joseph Hoffmann at the Jesus Project noted that Jesus is getting more vague, ambiguous, and uncertain the more scholars study him, rather than the other way around.[116

I don't get James Donald's email, so I can only reply indirectly: show me the evidence. There is contemporary evidence
of the existence of Pontius Pilate... There is *no contemporary* evidence for Jesus. Even if you consider Josephus a contemporary, which he isn't, it is widely accepted that the
few lines  "he scribbled" on Jesus are a much later
interpolation, a forgery done by some devout
who was embarrassed at the paucity of evidence for the
messiah. As for Tacitus - he was writing at an even later
date, circa 120 CE, and if the brief passage in which he
mentions Christus is not a forgery, its simply the case of
him repeating propaganda he had heard from early Christians themselves. And thats it! I won't bother to

I realize nuance and, you know, reading and thinking about something, don't come naturally to your or your ilk, but i'll go ahead and repost the following link:
Henrik Selin, head of the Department for Intercultural Dialogue at the Swedish Institute, told us the surge of asylum seekers in 2015 has created challenges for Sweden, but he said reports from right-leaning media about a surge of immigrant crime have been “highly exaggerated.”
“So many things are being claimed,” Selin said. “If you look at the facts, there is nothing to support the claim that the crime rate took off after the 160,000 came in 2015.”
Crime has generally been trending down for the last decade, but there was a small uptick last year, he said. While it’s true that immigrants have been over-represented among those committing crimes — particularly in some suburban communities heavily populated by immigrants, he said — the issue of crime and immigration is complex. Upon closer examination, Selin said, researchers have found that the crime is more closely associated with factors like joblessness, poverty and exclusion from society. “It is not clear that immigrants are susceptible to committing such crimes,” he said.
Nor is it at all true, Selin said, that there are so-called no-go zones where police are afraid to patrol, or where locals have instituted sharia law, as Horowitz claimed. Selin’s refutation was echoed by Felipe Estrada Dörner, a criminology professor at Stockholm University, interviewed by the Washington Post.
But that is not to say there are not some “challenges in the short term … that we need to deal with,” Selin said.
Jerzy Sarnecki, a criminology professor at Stockholm University, said that claims about surging violence due to immigration are “lies.”
“But really good lies always have a little bit of truth in them,” Sarnecki told us in an email. “So also in this case.”
Sarnecki noted that Sweden has a “very broad legal definition of rape” and that “Swedish women are aware of their rights and have a high propensity to report sexual assaults, and we calculate crimes in a different manner than comparable countries.”

The first bubonic plague in England in 1340s led to a huge shortage
of labor and ultimately contributed to the end of serfdom..
wikipedia says:
The English government handled the crisis well, and the country did not experience the extreme reactions that were seen elsewhere in Europe. The most immediate consequence was a halt to the campaigns of the Hundred Years' War. In the long term, the decrease in population caused a shortage of labour, with subsequent rise in wages, resisted by the landowners, which caused deep resentment among the lower classes. The Peasants' Revolt of 1381 was largely a result of this resentment, and even though the rebellion was suppressed, in the long term serfdom was ended in England. The Black Death also affected artistic and cultural efforts, and may have helped advance the use of the vernacular.

I think it's healthy that at least that everyone is aware tor has these weaknesses, and if a GPA wants to find you, they probably will..
What concerns me are possible weaknesses that fall under your "What else?" category, although /hopefully/ there isn't a lot to that, with all the effort that has been put into showing  tors weak spots. What also concerns me is - are the developers actually engaged in new ideas to address  and  or are they more worried about the browser bundle??

I realize nuance and, you know, reading and thinking about something, don't come naturally to your or your ilk, but i'll go ahead and repost the following link:
Henrik Selin, head of the Department for Intercultural Dialogue at the Swedish Institute, told us the surge of asylum seekers in 2015 has created challenges for Sweden, but he said reports from right-leaning media about a surge of immigrant crime have been “highly exaggerated.”
“So many things are being claimed,” Selin said. “If you look at the facts, there is nothing to support the claim that the crime rate took off after the 160,000 came in 2015.”
Crime has generally been trending down for the last decade, but there was a small uptick last year, he said. While it’s true that immigrants have been over-represented among those committing crimes — particularly in some suburban communities heavily populated by immigrants, he said — the issue of crime and immigration is complex. Upon closer examination, Selin said, researchers have found that the crime is more closely associated with factors like joblessness, poverty and exclusion from society. “It is not clear that immigrants are susceptible to committing such crimes,” he said.
Nor is it at all true, Selin said, that there are so-called no-go zones where police are afraid to patrol, or where locals have instituted sharia law, as Horowitz claimed. Selin’s refutation was echoed by Felipe Estrada Dörner, a criminology professor at Stockholm University, interviewed by the Washington Post.
But that is not to say there are not some “challenges in the short term … that we need to deal with,” Selin said.
Jerzy Sarnecki, a criminology professor at Stockholm University, said that claims about surging violence due to immigration are “lies.”
“But really good lies always have a little bit of truth in them,” Sarnecki told us in an email. “So also in this case.”
Sarnecki noted that Sweden has a “very broad legal definition of rape” and that “Swedish women are aware of their rights and have a high propensity to report sexual assaults, and we calculate crimes in a different manner than comparable countries.”

The first bubonic plague in England in 1340s led to a huge shortage
of labor and ultimately contributed to the end of serfdom..
wikipedia says:
The English government handled the crisis well, and the country did not experience the extreme reactions that were seen elsewhere in Europe. The most immediate consequence was a halt to the campaigns of the Hundred Years' War. In the long term, the decrease in population caused a shortage of labour, with subsequent rise in wages, resisted by the landowners, which caused deep resentment among the lower classes. The Peasants' Revolt of 1381 was largely a result of this resentment, and even though the rebellion was suppressed, in the long term serfdom was ended in England. The Black Death also affected artistic and cultural efforts, and may have helped advance the use of the vernacular.

Ever read Umberto's novel "Focault's Pendelum"? I know you are into the
Illuminatus Trilogy, based on some past quotes you've posted, it's got a
similar vibe.. its a great fucking book!
His ur-fascism treatise is great, and actually seems to me to be hilariously on-point with the current political situation.. a couple
of his points -
"The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is
an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by
"One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the
appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an
economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened
by the pressure of lower social groups."
".. root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the obsession with a plot,
possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged. The
easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia. But the plot
must also come from the inside: Jews are usually the best target because
they have the advantage of being at the same time inside and outside"

Someone who doesn't buy into a particular conspiracy does not (necessarily) share any traits with the religious whack jobs that burned witches at the stake. They were driven by ignorance and religious fervor.
It seems you would like to have it both ways - denying the validity of science when it suits you, and at the same time using your own brand of scientific speculation to support a particular conspiracy, again when it suits you. Either science is real, or it isn't. Hint: science and the scientific method are fucking real. Huge mistakes in medical sciences have most definitely been made, but they tend to be self correcting over time. That's how science works.

Did i ever mention that i don't give a fuck about your idiotic and untrue non-sequitirs?
I never said that or even implied it. Was "curing" gays ever accepted as science by anyone, anywhere? Maybe mistakes is the wrong word for some of those examples - you love to pick at things with your pedantic little mind. The point is there have been all sorts of fuck ups in the history of medicine, and rational inquiry AKA science is how they get solved.
Tsk tsk all you want dickhead, it's a fact. All sorts of toxic shit was passed off prior to the fda (and after, for that matter). My anarchist utopia will have some sort of opt-in dope inspection line, but I'm happy for you to die of arsenic poisoning in yours.

No. It's a "field" that can be gamed and manipulated using analytical techniques, but fundamentally it would fall more in line as a form of sociology or some other study of people.

I disagree, for the most part, on this particular issue. The factions seem to me to be a tiny percentage of scientists willing to stand with the "oil mafia", vs the vast majority who seem to me to be standing with the science. Even if the democrats at least profess belief in this existential issue, what did they ever really do about it? Anything of consequence? I don't think the factions break down like you imagine, and I don't give the democrats much credit simply for refusing to deny the issue.
Ok, I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Obviously this is a disgusting blemish on the history of "scientific inquiry" ;) ... I don't put much stock in psychology personally, despite what you may think.
Yes, many of them were criminal acts, no doubt, with financial pressure pushing legit science aside and causing atrocities. I won't bother with another list, you can gaagle it yourself ;) In any case, they were still mistakes.
I wouldn't argue with that.  I do figure there are a lot more principled scientists out there than you think, but I don't pretend to know the numbers.
It certainly improved the chances of not being sold toxic snake oil. All your bullshit from here on out trying to paint me as a statist because I stated a fact is just that - so much bullshit.
I'm an American, we only speak English, remember?  My point stands (I haven't bothered to translate your German yet, it was a long weekend, and my head is killing me ...)
I knew you'd jump all over the progress line as soon as I sent it ;).  Poorly worded, but again my point stands. As I said before I would want some sort of opt in drugs inspection in whatever anarchist utopia I can imagine. Mentioning the FDA doesn't make me a statist.

Ever read Umberto's novel "Focault's Pendelum"? I know you are into the
Illuminatus Trilogy, based on some past quotes you've posted, it's got a
similar vibe.. its a great fucking book!
His ur-fascism treatise is great, and actually seems to me to be hilariously on-point with the current political situation.. a couple
of his points -
"The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is
an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by
"One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the
appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an
economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened
by the pressure of lower social groups."
".. root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the obsession with a plot,
possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged. The
easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia. But the plot
must also come from the inside: Jews are usually the best target because
they have the advantage of being at the same time inside and outside"

Someone who doesn't buy into a particular conspiracy does not (necessarily) share any traits with the religious whack jobs that burned witches at the stake. They were driven by ignorance and religious fervor.
It seems you would like to have it both ways - denying the validity of science when it suits you, and at the same time using your own brand of scientific speculation to support a particular conspiracy, again when it suits you. Either science is real, or it isn't. Hint: science and the scientific method are fucking real. Huge mistakes in medical sciences have most definitely been made, but they tend to be self correcting over time. That's how science works.

You've made plenty of outrageous claims - that global warming is a hoax,
that children can't suffer from cognitive disabilities, etc. There have been mistakes besides atrocities like the lobotomy. Early
experimentation with radiation, heparin adulteration out of china,
exploding breast implants, all sorts of toxic shit before the FDA came
around, etc, etc. Rational inquiry is what leads to the correction of mistakes. I would

How ducking retarded are you? The us republican government DOES NOT believe in anthropogenic climate change. You are right in line with Trump and his cronies.
Did i ever mention that i don't give a fuck about your idiotic and untrue non-sequitirs?
I never said that or even implied it. Was "curing" gays ever accepted as science by anyone, anywhere? Maybe mistakes is the wrong word for some of those examples - you love to pick at things with your pedantic little mind. The point is there have been all sorts of fuck ups in the history of medicine, and rational inquiry AKA science is how they get solved.
Tsk tsk all you want dickhead, it's a fact. All sorts of toxic shit was passed off prior to the fda (and after, for that matter). My anarchist utopia will have some sort of opt-in dope inspection line, but I'm happy for you to die of arsenic poisoning in yours.
So what? Nobody said the FDA was perfect, or even close. It's called progress.

No. It's a "field" that can be gamed and manipulated using analytical techniques, but fundamentally it would fall more in line as a form of sociology or some other study of people. Economic policy is dictated by the barrel of the gun, rules and charters and guidelines written out by corporate interests and enforced by the various governments in a very transparent attempt at keeping the rich man (and nation) rich and the poor man (and nation) poor.

I disagree, for the most part, on this particular issue. The factions seem to me to be a tiny percentage of scientists willing to stand with the "oil mafia", vs the vast majority who seem to me to be standing with the science. Even if the democrats at least profess belief in this existential issue, what did they ever really do about it? Anything of consequence? I don't think the factions break down like you imagine, and I don't give the democrats much credit simply for refusing to deny the issue.
Ok, I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Obviously this is a disgusting blemish on the history of "scientific inquiry" ;) ... I don't put much stock in psychology personally, despite what you may think.
Yes, many of them were criminal acts, no doubt, with financial pressure pushing legit science aside and causing atrocities. I won't bother with another list, you can gaagle it yourself ;) In any case, they were still mistakes.
I wouldn't argue with that.  I do figure there are a lot more principled scientists out there than you think, but I don't pretend to know the numbers.
It certainly improved the chances of not being sold toxic snake oil. All your bullshit from here on out trying to paint me as a statist because I stated a fact is just that - so much bullshit.
I'm an American, we only speak English, remember?  My point stands (I haven't bothered to translate your German yet, it was a long weekend, and my head is killing me ...)
I knew you'd jump all over the progress line as soon as I sent it ;).  Poorly worded, but again my point stands. As I said before I would want some sort of opt in drugs inspection in whatever anarchist utopia I can imagine. Mentioning the FDA doesn't make me a statist. But I realize how much you love jumping all over such small minded pedantic bullshit and I'm happy you found something you think is such a powerful point ;)

Secret New Billionaires Cash in With Cryptocurrencies
   An unknown cryptocurrency trader turned $55 million of paper
   wealth into $283 million in just over a month.
   The only clue about this person or persons, beyond a virtual
   wallet with the identification code
   0x00A651D43B6e209F5Ada45A35F92EFC0De3A5184, surfaced on a June
   11 Instagram posting, in Bahasa, in which he or she (or they)
   (or somebody posing as them) boasted about the 413 percent profit
   accumulated earlier this year from ether, the digital money of
   the Ethereum blockchain.
   [IMG]

   Digital Heist
   "I get many private messages asking how much ether I have," the
   post read, alongside photos that purported to be the hardware
   powering a mining operation but looked lifted from another
   website. "One of the cool things about Ethereum is that all
   wallets around the world are transparent and open for everyone
   to see. And this is my wallet's savings."
   Hidden identities are a popular feature of the twilight world
   of virtual money. Now that the total value of cryptocurrency,
   such as bitcoin and ether, soared June 6 to more than $100
   billion, approaching the market value of McDonald's Corp.,
   concerned regulators say it might be time to link wallet IDs
   with actual humans.
  Nom de Guerre
   Secrecy persists from the days, earlier this decade, when Ross
   Ulbricht, going by the nom de guerre Dread Pirate Roberts, used
   bitcoin to launder money and traffic in narcotics, activities
   for which he started serving a life term at the Metropolitan
   Correctional Center in New York.
   That's not to say that 0x00A651D43B6e209F5Ada45A35F92EFC0De3A5184
   or any other entities are doing anything illegal. But opacity
   may be worsening jagged price movements. The value of ether, for
   example, rose from about $8 a unit at the start of the year to
   crest at $400 in June before settling around $250 today. A lack
   of transparency could also be stifling the mainstreaming of
   online money, according to draft legislation issued by the
   European Parliament in March.
   "The credibility of virtual currencies will not rise if they are
   used for criminal purposes," the draft said. "In this context,
   anonymity will become more a hindrance than an asset for virtual
   currencies" and their potential future popularity.
   Pseudonymity has always been a big part of the market's allure.
   Upending traditional ways of doing business was the lodestar for

   Ether, the second-most-popular cryptocurrency after bitcoin, is
   used to pay for applications or programs that run on the Ethereum
   blockchain, a secured list of transactions that can be shared.
   That allows for the use of "smart contracts," or pieces of
   computer code that make the terms of such agreements operate
   automatically. The blockchain has the potential to reshape
   business and finance by enabling immediate settlements of
   activities such as bank transfers and securities trades.
   JPMorgan Chase & Co., BP Plc, Microsoft Corp. and ING Groep NV
   are among those experimenting with it.
   The current value of all the ether held, $23 billion, means
   dozens of electronic wallets have accrued nine-figure positions.
   Many of them could be held by individuals, according to a Bloomberg
   analysis. Individuals can hold multiple wallets.
  Crypto-Billionaire
   Likely candidates to be crypto-billionaires include hedge fund
   manager Michael Novogratz, Joseph Lubin, founder of ConsenSys,
   a blockchain production studio that works on Ethereum, and
   Ethereum creator Buterin.
   Novogratz, a former executive at Fortress Investment Group and
   Goldman Sachs Group Inc., has a long way to go, but he's been a
   consistent booster. He said last month that he has 10 percent
   of his net worth invested in virtual money. That's a stake worth
   at least $90 million, given a net worth calculated at $925
   million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Novogratz
   declined to comment.
   Cryptocurrencies could become a $5 trillion industry, but they
   need to develop sound business principles to satisfy regulators
   and lend legitimacy, Novogratz said June 27 at a fintech conference
   in New York.
   Lubin, the former chief operating officer for Ethereum Switzerland
   GmbH, which developed the software, could hold hundreds of
   millions of dollars worth of ether, several investors said. The
   Canadian entrepreneur didn't respond to requests for comment on
   his holdings.
   "The long-range vision is moving the fundamental transactional
   elements of our society from analog, friction-filled systems to
   natively digital frictionless systems," Lubin told Bloomberg
   Radio June 21.
   Buterin said in a Reddit post last month his ether holdings equal
   what would amount to about $117 million today, according to
   calculations by Bloomberg.
   Like bitcoin, ether is struggling to overcome a reputation sullied
   by cyberattacks and technology bottlenecks. A flash crash last
   month saw the price of the cryptocurrency tumble to just 10 cents
   before rebounding to about $300.
   "A lot of lessons will be learned," said Peter Denious, head of
   global venture capital at Aberdeen Asset Management in Stamford,
   Connecticut. "A lot of money will be lost before a lot of money
   can be made."

"Anarcho-capitalism" has more in common with fascism and post-industrial

For a fair idea of how it might play out, just look back 150 years

This is why I feel it's a good idea to own your domain name, your own physical server, and run software you've configured yourself as much as possible - including your email server. Obviously having a colo'd mail server you maintain yourself doesn't solve everything - do you trust the data center? Don't forget anything sent plain text over the wire is liable for trivial interception by US/allied SIGINT apparatus...  And there is some cost involved, although at least these costs are up front and don't involve fuck-knows-what happening with whatever private data you provided to google or yahoo (or riseup ;)

Bugs that already have some PoC or other code to exploit the issue? Or
the sum total of all exploitable bugs, discovered and undiscovered?
The first case should be relatively small with a very current
release..  the second case obviously could be different.
Without patching, discovered bugs will increase over time. The actual
number of bugs stays the same of course (again, without patching).
Obviously you're a fool if you don't maintain your software...

Growing up in texas we were taught in high school that the civil war was NOT about slavery - it was about states' rights!
I heard a story on NPR the other day about public schools in, I think it was Oklahoma, about how the fucking textbooks and curriculum are written by the petroleum industry. All the science and math classes try to teach everything within the context of petroleum, as much as possible. For all i know you have to read Oil! (or watch the excellent There Will Be Blood) to pass the goddamn english class. Anyway, i do agree that education is paramount... but how we prevent a dystopia Jesusland / east coast / west coast split in schools, and how to make sure kids get a valuable education?

I did a brief google search and the EFF has some info on this case

As to how the FBI found the tor hidden service in the first place,
the claim is simply that they recieved a tip that the hidden service
playpen's "actual IP address was publicly visible."
Specifically, "The tip the FBI received pointed out that Playpen
was misconfigured, and its actual IP address was publicly available
and appeared to resolve to a location within the U.S. "

Prozac is not a "mild sedative". It's an SSRI (Selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitor), very similar to a whole bunch of other
anti-depressants, but not at all similar, in any way, to pot.
The comparison _is_ silly. It's apples and oranges - they're both
fruit, but the similarity ends there.
My claim of what? Umm.. check your email man. I take you at your word
that you are "straight-edge" (although I'm sure you have no problem
taking an aspirin if you have a headache or taking whatever meds a
doctor might prescribe if you are ill). The fact that you seem to think
I called you a pill-popper just goes to show: it doesn't take weed (or
pills) to fuck with your memory :P For that matter, marijuana has finally and fairly quickly begun to
be acknowledged as having legit medical benefits in the US, by the
"authorities" (who I clearly give a big 'fuck you' to, but anyway).
There are some cases where it is the only medication without
significant side effects that controls seizures... and other cases
where patients find it vastly preferable for treatment of painful
conditions as opposed to long term prescribed opiates, which are
of course extremely addictive, potentially dangerous, and can have
a powerful "high" that some people simply do not like. Too sedating,
too "strong", in comparison with marijuana. I presume you wouldn't
be so quick to judge people who partake of the plant if they simply
have a piece of paper from a higher authority that says they need
I don't pass judgment on someone's personal choices, no. Passing
judgment on the actions of someone that has a direct negative
consequence for others, like judging a murderer or a thief to be a
piece of shit, or a politician who leads a nation into a war to
be just a bigger piece of the same type of shit, is completely
different than passing judgment on someone's personal choices.
Judging someone for smoking pot is like judging someone for being
gay - it's absurd. What you suspect about me is wrong.
Anecdotes are nice, but they're just anecdotes, and in this case
from someone who obviously considers themselves superior because
they are "straight-edge". There are plenty of people that get all
sorts of shit done who smoke marijuana, just as there are plenty
of people that get nothing done who are "straight-edge". It is not
the defining characteristic you seem to think, and to judge someone
based solely on that trait is being judgmental, and having a closed
mind. A condition that the occasional indulgence in pot (or other
entheogens) could actually help you with, actually ;)

And the first comment on the page says -
"You dummies have mixed up Greenwald's net worth with that of Ebay founder Pierre Omidyar, who had funded a joint venture with Greenwald. Omidyar is/was worth 8.5 billion."
So i am extremely dubious Greenwald is worth anywhere near 8.5 billion ;)

It's a PERSONAL CHOICE you fucking fascist. People are free to comport themselves in whatever manner they choose. And, again, since this seems to fly past your tiny little brain, smoking pot

P.S. - I didn't address this absurd claim directly because, well, it's

briefly, being a so-called "doctor" of "alternative medicine" (or
holistic health or whatever you want to call it) is obviously not
equivalent to being a qualified surgeon. Anyone who would let you cut
their brain open for brain surgery based on your little $15 holistic
health certificate deserves the lobotomy (or death) they are about to

Dude, your holistic alternative medicine bullshit has nothing to do with epilepsy. You are spouting nonsense. You're a fucking quack.
Specialized language ? What specialized language would that be? Nobody is using big words here, "Doctor".
Accidents happen. It's a fact.
But pain is often an accompanied symptom of terminal illnesses. Again, why
should someone who is dying be forced to suffer? You're a fucking sadist.
My argument has been clear from the start: what people do in their private lives
is none of your fucking business!
Lol. I don't owe my personal life choices to anyone, most especially not
to whatever kind of spiritual nonsense you are babbling about. "Hemp nuts" - you really are a hilarious quack.
Well bully for you. Did you get your law degree at the same site selling
the doctorate in holistic medicine? My use of the F word? I can use whatever fucking word I want, just as I can
smoke whatever plant I want. I don't lack a will to work. My professional life is none of your business - unlike you, I don't feel the need to brag about a piece of paper from an authority figure

As to how the FBI found the tor hidden service in the first place,
the claim is simply that they recieved a tip that the hidden service
playpen's "actual IP address was publicly visible."
Specifically, "The tip the FBI received pointed out that Playpen
was misconfigured, and its actual IP address was publicly available

I called you a pill-popper just goes to show: it doesn't take weed (or
pills) to fuck with your memory :P For that matter, marijuana has finally and fairly quickly begun to
be acknowledged as having legit medical benefits in the US, by the
"authorities" (who I clearly give a big 'fuck you' to, but anyway).
There are some cases where it is the only medication without
significant side effects that controls seizures... and other cases
where patients find it vastly preferable for treatment of painful
conditions as opposed to long term prescribed opiates, which are
of course extremely addictive, potentially dangerous, and can have
a powerful "high" that some people simply do not like. Too sedating,
too "strong", in comparison with marijuana. I presume you wouldn't
be so quick to judge people who partake of the plant if they simply

I don't pass judgment on someone's personal choices, no. Passing
judgment on the actions of someone that has a direct negative
consequence for others, like judging a murderer or a thief to be a
piece of shit, or a politician who leads a nation into a war to
be just a bigger piece of the same type of shit, is completely
different than passing judgment on someone's personal choices.
Judging someone for smoking pot is like judging someone for being
gay - it's absurd. What you suspect about me is wrong.
Anecdotes are nice, but they're just anecdotes, and in this case
from someone who obviously considers themselves superior because
they are "straight-edge". There are plenty of people that get all
sorts of shit done who smoke marijuana, just as there are plenty
of people that get nothing done who are "straight-edge". It is not
the defining characteristic you seem to think, and to judge someone
based solely on that trait is being judgmental, and having a closed
mind. A condition that the occasional indulgence in pot (or other
entheogens) could actually help you with, actually ;)

"As per Forbes estimation in 2013, 49 year old Glenn is standing with a net worth of $8.5 million. This figure is supposed to have increased significantly since then."
And the first comment on the page says -
"You dummies have mixed up Greenwald's net worth with that of Ebay founder Pierre Omidyar, who had funded a joint venture with Greenwald. Omidyar is/was worth 8.5 billion."
So i am extremely dubious Greenwald is worth anywhere near 8.5 billion ;)

briefly, being a so-called "doctor" of "alternative medicine" (or

Dude, your holistic alternative medicine bullshit has nothing to do with epilepsy. You are spouting nonsense. You're a fucking quack.
Specialized language ? What specialized language would that be? Nobody is using big words here, "Doctor".
Accidents happen. It's a fact.
But pain is often an accompanied symptom of terminal illnesses. Again, why
should someone who is dying be forced to suffer? You're a fucking sadist.
My argument has been clear from the start: what people do in their private lives
is none of your fucking business!

to whatever kind of spiritual nonsense you are babbling about. "Hemp nuts" - you really are a hilarious quack.
Well bully for you. Did you get your law degree at the same site selling

What deep insight.

Maybe we can send some death squads out to the science departments at any institution doing climate research? Especially if they're (((jewish))) - sounds right up your alley, you bad boy ;)
In any case, Chrichton selectively chose a few things which, as i said, no one ever claimed was a known science. Like the drake equation.  Then he further selected a bunch of stuff that has been discredited, thanks to further scientific work, over time. In effect, he showed that science, over time, works.
And naturally he stayed away from all the wonderful things that have been wrought by scientific innovation, and that are in fact a CONSENSUS, once they have been accepted by the scientific community. That these consensuses can change is obvious, or he wouldn't have had so much crap science to pick from (and doctors would still be following Galen and bleeding you to get your humors in order when you went to hospital)
The fact that science advances is not a legitimate attack on any particular piece of current science. If that's all you got... you got nothing.

Kinda off-topic, but interesting.
Stanford University economist Tony Seba forecasts in his new report that
petrol or diesel cars, buses, or trucks will no longer be sold anywhere
in the world within the next eight years. As a result, the
transportation market will transition and switch entirely to
electrification, "leading to a collapse of oil prices and the demise of
the petroleum industry as we have known it for a century," reports
Financial Post. From the report:
Seba's premise is that people will stop driving altogether. They will
switch en masse to self-drive electric vehicles (EVs) that are ten times
cheaper to run than fossil-based cars, with a near-zero marginal cost of
fuel and an expected lifespan of 1 million miles. Only nostalgics will
cling to the old habit of car ownership. The rest will adapt to vehicles
on demand. It will become harder to find a petrol station, spares, or
anybody to fix the 2,000 moving parts that bedevil the internal
combustion engine. Dealers will disappear by 2024. Cities will ban human
drivers once the data confirms how dangerous they can be behind a wheel.
This will spread to suburbs, and then beyond. There will be a "mass
stranding of existing vehicles." The value of second-hard cars will
plunge. You will have to pay to dispose of your old vehicle. It is a
twin "death spiral" for big oil and big autos, with ugly implications
for some big companies on the London Stock Exchange unless they adapt in
time. The long-term price of crude will fall to $25 a barrel. Most forms
of shale and deep-water drilling will no longer be viable. Assets will
be stranded. Scotland will forfeit any North Sea bonanza. Russia, Saudi
Arabia, Nigeria, and Venezuela will be in trouble.

What deep insight.

I guess it's easier to jump on this bandwagon than try to defend any of your other countless (and disgusting) hypocritical views.
Maybe we can send some death squads out to the science departments at any institution doing climate research? Especially if they're (((jewish))) - sounds right up your alley, you bad boy ;)
In any case, Chrichton selectively chose a few things which, as i said, no one ever claimed was a known science. Like the drake equation.  Then he further selected a bunch of stuff that has been discredited, thanks to further scientific work, over time. In effect, he showed that science, over time, works.
And naturally he stayed away from all the wonderful things that have been wrought by scientific innovation, and that are in fact a CONSENSUS, once they have been accepted by the scientific community. That these consensuses can change is obvious, or he wouldn't have had so much crap science to pick from (and doctors would still be following Galen and bleeding you to get your humors in order when you went to hospital)
The fact that science advances is not a legitimate attack on any particular piece of current science. If that's all you got... you got nothing.

Kinda off-topic, but interesting.
Stanford University economist Tony Seba forecasts in his new report that
petrol or diesel cars, buses, or trucks will no longer be sold anywhere
in the world within the next eight years. As a result, the
transportation market will transition and switch entirely to
electrification, "leading to a collapse of oil prices and the demise of
the petroleum industry as we have known it for a century," reports
Financial Post. From the report:
Seba's premise is that people will stop driving altogether. They will
switch en masse to self-drive electric vehicles (EVs) that are ten times
cheaper to run than fossil-based cars, with a near-zero marginal cost of
fuel and an expected lifespan of 1 million miles. Only nostalgics will
cling to the old habit of car ownership. The rest will adapt to vehicles
on demand. It will become harder to find a petrol station, spares, or
anybody to fix the 2,000 moving parts that bedevil the internal
combustion engine. Dealers will disappear by 2024. Cities will ban human
drivers once the data confirms how dangerous they can be behind a wheel.
This will spread to suburbs, and then beyond. There will be a "mass
stranding of existing vehicles." The value of second-hard cars will
plunge. You will have to pay to dispose of your old vehicle. It is a
twin "death spiral" for big oil and big autos, with ugly implications
for some big companies on the London Stock Exchange unless they adapt in
time. The long-term price of crude will fall to $25 a barrel. Most forms
of shale and deep-water drilling will no longer be viable. Assets will
be stranded. Scotland will forfeit any North Sea bonanza. Russia, Saudi
Arabia, Nigeria, and Venezuela will be in trouble.

@_subject: Stingray warrant 
I'm not sure, but a very brief look at the OpenBTS website showed that
there is a branch of the code that does support 3G these days.
The wikipedia article on "Stingray Phone Tracker" is actually pretty
interesting -
Relevant excerpt:
Interception of communications content[edit]
By way of software upgrades,[16][29] the StingRay and similar Harris
products can be used to intercept GSM communications content
transmitted over-the-air between a target cellular device and a
legitimate service provider cell site. The StingRay does this by
way of the following man-in-the-middle attack: (1) simulate a cell
site and force a connection from the target device, (2) download
the target device's IMSI and other identifying information, (3)
conduct "GSM Active Key Extraction"[16] to obtain the target device's
stored encryption key, (4) use the downloaded identifying information
to simulate the target device over-the-air, (5) while simulating
the target device, establish a connection with a legitimate cell
site authorized to provide service to the target device, (6) use
the encryption key to authenticate the StingRay to the service
provider as being the target device, and (7) forward signals between
the target device and the legitimate cell site while decrypting and
recording communications content.
The "GSM Active Key Extraction"[16] performed by the StingRay in
step three merits additional explanation. A GSM phone encrypts all
communications content using an encryption key stored on its SIM
card with a copy stored at the service provider.[30] While simulating
the target device during the above explained man-in-the-middle
attack, the service provider cell site will ask the StingRay (which
it believes to be the target device) to initiate encryption using
the key stored on the target device.[31] Therefore, the StingRay
needs a method to obtain the target device's stored encryption key
else the man-in-the-middle attack will fail.
GSM primarily encrypts communications content using the A5/1 call
encryption cypher. In 2008 it was reported that a GSM phone's
encryption key can be obtained using $1,000 worth of computer
hardware and 30 minutes of cryptanalysis performed on signals
encrypted using A5/1.[32] However, GSM also supports an export
weakened variant of A5/1 called A5/2. This weaker encryption cypher
can be cracked in real-time.[30] While A5/1 and A5/2 use different
cypher strengths, they each use the same underlying encryption key
stored on the SIM card.[31] Therefore, the StingRay performs "GSM
Active Key Extraction"[16] during step three of the man-in-the-middle
attack as follows: (1) instruct target device to use the weaker
A5/2 encryption cypher, (2) collect A5/2 encrypted signals from
target device, and (3) perform cryptanalysis of the A5/2 signals
to quickly recover the underlying stored encryption key.[33] Once
the encryption key is obtained, the StingRay uses it to comply with
the encryption request made to it by the service provider during
the man-in-the-middle attack.[33]
I don't know if modern phones are still vulnerable to the "GSM Active
Key Extraction" - haven't had more than a few moments to look at it.

That's not what it means / how it works. I'm not much of a
mathematician, but O(1) simply means a routine that will always
take the same amount of time, regardless the input data.
If you don't know the length of the string before hand, and assuming for
sake of example none of the arguments to printf are function calls, eg
printf("math results: %.2f!\n", unknown_math_func(23)), then
I suppose its O(N) where N = the length of the string being printed.
I don't see why this would be any different for Python and its print
function (again, assuming none of the arguments to a format string
are function calls, e.g. -  print "math results: %.2f!\n" %

As to Android… Linux probably had much better ARM support than *BSD
when Google chose it for Android. Definitely a lot more developers.
And they don’t seem to  care about keeping most of Android open
source, which is why you there are so many good, different, ROMS

I'm not sure, but a very brief look at the OpenBTS website showed that
there is a branch of the code that does support 3G these days.
The wikipedia article on "Stingray Phone Tracker" is actually pretty
interesting -
Relevant excerpt:
Interception of communications content[edit]
By way of software upgrades,[16][29] the StingRay and similar Harris
products can be used to intercept GSM communications content
transmitted over-the-air between a target cellular device and a
legitimate service provider cell site. The StingRay does this by
way of the following man-in-the-middle attack: (1) simulate a cell
site and force a connection from the target device, (2) download
the target device's IMSI and other identifying information, (3)
conduct "GSM Active Key Extraction"[16] to obtain the target device's
stored encryption key, (4) use the downloaded identifying information
to simulate the target device over-the-air, (5) while simulating
the target device, establish a connection with a legitimate cell
site authorized to provide service to the target device, (6) use
the encryption key to authenticate the StingRay to the service
provider as being the target device, and (7) forward signals between
the target device and the legitimate cell site while decrypting and
recording communications content.
The "GSM Active Key Extraction"[16] performed by the StingRay in
step three merits additional explanation. A GSM phone encrypts all
communications content using an encryption key stored on its SIM
card with a copy stored at the service provider.[30] While simulating
the target device during the above explained man-in-the-middle
attack, the service provider cell site will ask the StingRay (which
it believes to be the target device) to initiate encryption using
the key stored on the target device.[31] Therefore, the StingRay
needs a method to obtain the target device's stored encryption key
else the man-in-the-middle attack will fail.
GSM primarily encrypts communications content using the A5/1 call
encryption cypher. In 2008 it was reported that a GSM phone's
encryption key can be obtained using $1,000 worth of computer
hardware and 30 minutes of cryptanalysis performed on signals
encrypted using A5/1.[32] However, GSM also supports an export
weakened variant of A5/1 called A5/2. This weaker encryption cypher
can be cracked in real-time.[30] While A5/1 and A5/2 use different
cypher strengths, they each use the same underlying encryption key
stored on the SIM card.[31] Therefore, the StingRay performs "GSM
Active Key Extraction"[16] during step three of the man-in-the-middle
attack as follows: (1) instruct target device to use the weaker
A5/2 encryption cypher, (2) collect A5/2 encrypted signals from
target device, and (3) perform cryptanalysis of the A5/2 signals
to quickly recover the underlying stored encryption key.[33] Once
the encryption key is obtained, the StingRay uses it to comply with
the encryption request made to it by the service provider during
the man-in-the-middle attack.[33]
I don't know if modern phones are still vulnerable to the "GSM Active
Key Extraction" - haven't had more than a few moments to look at it.

That's not what it means / how it works. I'm not much of a
mathematician, but O(1) simply means a routine that will always
take the same amount of time, regardless the input data.
If you don't know the length of the string before hand, and assuming for
sake of example none of the arguments to printf are function calls, eg
printf("math results: %.2f!\n", unknown_math_func(23)), then
I suppose its O(N) where N = the length of the string being printed.
I don't see why this would be any different for Python and its print
function (again, assuming none of the arguments to a format string
are function calls, e.g. -  print "math results: %.2f!\n" %
I honestly don't know where you geting the idea of O(0) from.. It made

Yes I didn’t read that far into your crap.. however, it doesn’t mean
what you think it means. Things aren’t as simple as your holocaust
denying mind would have them be. Open your mind!  ;)
Link - load it for the graphs:
Over the Earth's history, there are times where atmospheric CO2 is higher than current levels. Intriguingly, the planet experienced widespread regions of glaciation during some of those periods. Does this contradict the warming effect of CO2? No, for one simple reason. CO2 is not the only driver of climate. To understand past climate, we need to include other forcings that drive climate. To do this, one study pieced together 490 proxy records to reconstruct CO2 levels over the last 540 million years (Royer 2006). This period is known as the Phanerozoic eon.
Atmospheric CO2 levels have reached spectacular values in the deep past, possibly topping over 5000 ppm in the late Ordovician around 440 million years ago. However, solar activity also falls as you go further back. In the early Phanerozoic, solar output was about 4% less than current levels. The combined net effect from CO2 and solar variations are shown in Figure 2. Periods of geographically widespread ice are indicated by shaded areas.
Figure 2: Combined radiative forcing from CO2 and sun through the Phanerozoic. Values are expressed relative to pre-industrial conditions (CO2 = 280 ppm; solar luminosity = 342 W/m2). The dark shaded bands correspond to periods with strong evidence for geographically widespread ice.
Periods of low CO2 coincide with periods of geographically widespread ice (with one notable exception, discussed below). This leads to the concept of the CO2-ice threshold - the CO2 level required to initiate a glaciation. When the sun is less active, the CO2-ice threshold is much higher. For example, while the CO2-ice threshold for present-day Earth is estimated to be 500 ppm, the equivalent threshold during the Late Ordovician (450 million years ago) is 3000 ppm.
However, until recently, CO2 levels during the late Ordovician were thought to be much greater than 3000 ppm which was problematic as the Earth experienced glacial conditions at this time. The CO2 data covering the late Ordovician is sparse with one data point in the CO2 proxy record close to this period - it has a value of 5600 ppm. Given that solar output was around 4% lower than current levels, CO2 would need to fall to 3000 ppm to permit glacial conditions. Could CO2 levels have fallen this far? Given the low temporal resolution of the CO2 record, the data was not conclusive.
Research examining strontium isotopes in the sediment record shed more light on this question (Young 2009). Rock weathering removes CO2 from the atmosphere. The process also produces a particular isotope of strontium, washed down to the oceans via rivers. The ratio of strontium isotopes in sediment layers can be used to construct a proxy record of continental weathering activity. The strontium record shows that around the middle Ordovician, weatherability increased leading to an increased consumption of CO2. However, this was balanced by increased volcanic outgassing adding CO2 to the atmosphere. Around 446 million years ago, volcanic activity dropped while rock weathering remained high. This caused CO2 levels to fall below 3000 ppm, initiating cooling. It turns out falling CO2 levels was the cause of late Ordovician glaciation.
So we see that comparisons of present day climate to periods 500 million years ago need to take into account that the sun was less active than now. What about times closer to home? The last time CO2 was similar to current levels was around 3 million years ago, during the Pliocene. Back then, CO2 levels remained at around 365 to 410 ppm for thousands of years. Arctic temperatures were 11 to 16°C warmer (Csank 2011). Global temperatures over this period is estimated to be 3 to 4°C warmer than pre-industrial temperatures.  Sea levels were around 25 metres higher than current sea level (Dwyer 2008).
If climate scientists were claiming CO2 was the only driver of climate, then high CO2 during glacial periods would be problematic. But any climate scientist will tell you CO2 is not the only driver of climate. Climatologist Dana Royer says it best: "the geologic record contains a treasure trove of 'alternative Earths' that allow scientists to study how the various components of the Earth system respond to a range of climatic forcings." Past periods of higher CO2 do not contradict the notion that CO2 warms global temperatures. On the contrary, they confirm the close coupling between CO2 and climate.

Dark Horse eventually reused when they published the entire series. First Comics only did 45 issues, which

I used to login to BBS's as "haflinger" in the early 90s. Even though
the book was written about 5 years before I was born, and even
though Neuromancer was my favorite sci-fi book for years from like
age 12 on, I think I thought the reference to Brunner's book was a little more obscure (I wasn't gonna call myself "Case", lol), and
it was still an awesome book ;)
I was surprised to see the Windup Girl on the list (which is a cool
book), but nothing from Peter Watts, Richard Morgan, or even Bruce Sterling..  I would've added Schismatrix by Sterling, and maybe The Difference
Engine by Sterling & Gibson (they invented Steampunk!).
I think Anathem might be my favorite Stephenson book. It's the one
I've read the most number of times, although of course I loved Snow
Crash when I was younger.. and Cryptonomicon, and even the Baroque
Cycle (well, at least the Jack Shaftoe bits :P)
That movie is fuckin awesome. I think it's also my favorite book
by Dick.. he got a lot of it so right because he was a speed freak
there for a good while, I think :P  For those that enjoyed the Scanner Darkly film, Linklater did another
film in a very similar animated style called "Waking Life" a few
years before ASD came out, and it was great.
The thing about Blade Runner is... its not a whole lot like the
book. The book is a totally different creature, its not a cyberpunk/noir
piece, its got all the weird Mercerism shit in it, and actually the
phrase "Blade Runner" is never mentioned once in the book. The
original title was of course "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"
- they actually got the title "Blade Runner" from a William Burroughs
book, which was an attempt at a screenplay that got published as a
novella (it was totally unfilmable) based on an EARLIER sci-fi novel
that Burroughs apparently liked and wanted to make a film treatment

Yes I didn’t read that far into your crap.. however, it doesn’t mean
what you think it means. Things aren’t as simple as your holocaust
denying mind would have them be. Open your mind!  ;)
Link - load it for the graphs:
Over the Earth's history, there are times where atmospheric CO2 is higher than current levels. Intriguingly, the planet experienced widespread regions of glaciation during some of those periods. Does this contradict the warming effect of CO2? No, for one simple reason. CO2 is not the only driver of climate. To understand past climate, we need to include other forcings that drive climate. To do this, one study pieced together 490 proxy records to reconstruct CO2 levels over the last 540 million years (Royer 2006). This period is known as the Phanerozoic eon.
Atmospheric CO2 levels have reached spectacular values in the deep past, possibly topping over 5000 ppm in the late Ordovician around 440 million years ago. However, solar activity also falls as you go further back. In the early Phanerozoic, solar output was about 4% less than current levels. The combined net effect from CO2 and solar variations are shown in Figure 2. Periods of geographically widespread ice are indicated by shaded areas.
Figure 2: Combined radiative forcing from CO2 and sun through the Phanerozoic. Values are expressed relative to pre-industrial conditions (CO2 = 280 ppm; solar luminosity = 342 W/m2). The dark shaded bands correspond to periods with strong evidence for geographically widespread ice.
Periods of low CO2 coincide with periods of geographically widespread ice (with one notable exception, discussed below). This leads to the concept of the CO2-ice threshold - the CO2 level required to initiate a glaciation. When the sun is less active, the CO2-ice threshold is much higher. For example, while the CO2-ice threshold for present-day Earth is estimated to be 500 ppm, the equivalent threshold during the Late Ordovician (450 million years ago) is 3000 ppm.
However, until recently, CO2 levels during the late Ordovician were thought to be much greater than 3000 ppm which was problematic as the Earth experienced glacial conditions at this time. The CO2 data covering the late Ordovician is sparse with one data point in the CO2 proxy record close to this period - it has a value of 5600 ppm. Given that solar output was around 4% lower than current levels, CO2 would need to fall to 3000 ppm to permit glacial conditions. Could CO2 levels have fallen this far? Given the low temporal resolution of the CO2 record, the data was not conclusive.
Research examining strontium isotopes in the sediment record shed more light on this question (Young 2009). Rock weathering removes CO2 from the atmosphere. The process also produces a particular isotope of strontium, washed down to the oceans via rivers. The ratio of strontium isotopes in sediment layers can be used to construct a proxy record of continental weathering activity. The strontium record shows that around the middle Ordovician, weatherability increased leading to an increased consumption of CO2. However, this was balanced by increased volcanic outgassing adding CO2 to the atmosphere. Around 446 million years ago, volcanic activity dropped while rock weathering remained high. This caused CO2 levels to fall below 3000 ppm, initiating cooling. It turns out falling CO2 levels was the cause of late Ordovician glaciation.
So we see that comparisons of present day climate to periods 500 million years ago need to take into account that the sun was less active than now. What about times closer to home? The last time CO2 was similar to current levels was around 3 million years ago, during the Pliocene. Back then, CO2 levels remained at around 365 to 410 ppm for thousands of years. Arctic temperatures were 11 to 16°C warmer (Csank 2011). Global temperatures over this period is estimated to be 3 to 4°C warmer than pre-industrial temperatures.  Sea levels were around 25 metres higher than current sea level (Dwyer 2008).
If climate scientists were claiming CO2 was the only driver of climate, then high CO2 during glacial periods would be problematic. But any climate scientist will tell you CO2 is not the only driver of climate. Climatologist Dana Royer says it best: "the geologic record contains a treasure trove of 'alternative Earths' that allow scientists to study how the various components of the Earth system respond to a range of climatic forcings." Past periods of higher CO2 do not contradict the notion that CO2 warms global temperatures. On the contrary, they confirm the close coupling between CO2 and climate.

LW&C - the original - is the first manga I ever bought.
I have the full 45 issue run of the first translation,
by First Comics - that's where the first 12 covers by
Frank Miller, Sienkiewicz and others came from that
Dark Horse eventually reused when they published the entire series. First Comics only did 45 issues, which
was only like half the story, and out of order...
So I have the Dark Horse prints too, which tell the story properly, in order :) And all the other Kazuo Koike & Goseki Kojima stuff Dark Horse translated... Still, LW&C is *the best*! I must've read it a dozen times over the years ;)  My girlfriend printed
this custom Daigoro shirt for me years ago, and I still wear it, although it's falling apart...
So far New LWC is good, the art almost reminds me or Kojima, and of course it's written by Kazuo -
although I think he's not quite at his peak - I still love reading the continuing adventures of Daigoro,
even with Itto and Yagyu dead....

This has always been my feeling TBH.
The ultra wealthy who have wisely diversified
holdings, and the ultra vicious thugs they employee, seem to be the natural winners
in this kind of massive doomsday scenario
(which I agree with Steve on - we've already
reached the tipping point, and the extremely half hearted gestures being made are far too
little far too late)...
William Gibsons last book, The Peripheral, where
he finally returned to a future SF, had an event
called "the jackpot" that happened over a
period of 30-40 years in the late 21st century
which basically killed off 3/4 of humanity until
the lower population combined with scientific
advances got humanity going again..
I could see something like this happening.
And the ultra wealthy were big winners in this scenario ;)
Still, some optimism every now and then is nice.

All I know is what was written in an intro to the
first translated volume - Kazuo Koike, still alive after the artist Goseki had long passed away, at first was reluctant to continue the story without his
old collaborator... but then Hideki Mori came along and Kazuo felt like he was the spiritual successor to Goseki, asked Goseki's wife for permission to continue the book, and that's all I know ;)
Hideki Mori's art is fantastic, and does have a remarkable
similarity to that of Goseki Kojima.

Yeah I'm sure a lot of CISOs have their CISSP.
I doubt many bother with any of the shady "ethical hacker" crap, but I could be totally wrong. I don't see a whole lot of value in the CISSP either, personally. I do have my CCNA from like 15 years ago, and I'm also Sun E-10k certified, though I've never touched such a device in my life ;). It was a requirement that a certain
number of employees get the cert at a previous job for them to maintain some reseller bullshit or something,
I don't remember ... ;)
Fucking classes are useless. If you want to study, get a EE or
CS degree (or one of the newer mash ups that wasn't around
when I went to college, like a BS in Computer Engineering).
Obviously it's not a vocational thing like the ethical bullshit, but probably more valuable. IME best ppl are often total autodidacts.

I still use a hosting company out of my home town, in good ol'

mailer software and the system itself. It's nice to have full control
over your domain / website / nameserver / mailserver / whatever,
if you can spare the minmimal amount of time to get it up and keep
it running.
Mutt speaks IMAP and also works quite well with a local Maildir
box, if you happen to be running it on your mail server (and it's
particularly fast with larger boxes when you've enabled header cache
- I recommend lmdb as the backend).
And it does GPG/PGP nicely with no need for plugins, just a few config
lines which can be quickly found on google.. Of course, it's not everyone's cup of tea, and maybe I'll revisit
Thunderbird some day.. I generally use either mutt or whatever mail
client I'm stuck with according to which phone I happen to have on me at

things were not going "as planned", I think.
Maybe. Or maybe the CIA starts channeling money into AP to get rid of
its "enemies", cuz the government is loaded too :P I think you make the mistake of assuming that there is a sizable portion
of the population that wouldn't simply cringe at the idea of AP, aside of
course from the sociopaths that own the majority of the capital, and the
governments that enable them. Of course, I'm still fascinated to see it play out. The tech isn't there
yet, despite all the hyperbole about Augur as AP.
I find it far more likely that "he" would target his economic enemies. I
feel like we've strayed off into fantasy comic-book super-hero land with
this

Long interview with guy who just wrote a book about faux-philanthropic
leaders of the new gilded age (or something ;) Interesting part where he described Snowden talking to a bunch of
these people, this "clash of ideals"  - [... snip ...] I mean, you have an amazing scene where they’re listening to Edward
Snowden on some Transatlantic communication; he was also listened to at
the TED Talk and so forth. And at one point, they think hey, he’s one of
us. And he tries to set them correct, no, I’m not out to rip people off,
I’m out to help their freedom.
AG: I went on a cruise ship called Summit at Sea for 3,000 or so
entrepreneurs who believe they are changing the world. I was interested
in what happens when you have this kind of density of people who are
convinced that they’re making the world a better place, and that growing
their businesses is how you make the world better, and you make the
world better by growing their businesses. This total idea of the
win-win. And one of the events was the talk by Edward Snowden via
videoconference from Russia. Chris Sacca, a venture capitalist in
Silicon Valley who’s been very, very successful, was his interlocutor.
So Chris kind of stood on stage looking up at this big screen asking
Edward Snowden questions. And this hasn’t really been reported ever, so
it’s kind of new in the book. And the scene where Snowden is talking and
explaining this kind of powerful vision of why he did what he did–he
kind of gave an explanation of it that I hadn’t heard before, which is
that he is convinced that the opportunity to dissent, to call out
something untrue in a society, that that act requires a certain freedom
to think thoughts, exchange ideas with others that are not visible to
the government. If we live in a world in which every communication is
surveilled and interdicted, potentially interdicted by government, we’re
going to live in a world in which change becomes very hard to make.
Because as soon as someone has a truly heretical idea, they’ll be
neutered; if not in the United States, then certainly in many countries.
It was a very interesting vision, and as he started describing, well,
the way I’m going to do that is I’m going to build all these tools that
would allow dissidents to actually operate more freely. A communication
tool so you can message without getting caught, a Facebook “like” tool
so you can socially network without losing your privacy, some kind of
tokenized identity so you can make clear to different websites that
you’re the same person without revealing which person you are–various
things. Snowden was describing the creation of all these things because
he wanted to live in a world in which dissent of the kind that he made
is possible, in which it’s possible to go up against power and not be
interrupted in that quest; that’s his motivation, his goal. And what was
so fascinating to me, given the cultural collision between this man who
deeply believed, whether you like him or not, in sacrifice and in taking
a risk for what he felt to be the greater good, who believed in fighting
the power structure–he was standing there talking to these 3,000, or you
know, however many were in the room–kind of entrepreneur types, whose
biggest goal is to, like, make $1 billion in a way that serves humanity.
And it’s like they couldn’t process him; they couldn’t process his set
of motivations. And so Chris Sacca says, wow, you sound like you’re
designing a lot of tools that, they sound like apps, or startup–do you
want to build a startup? I mean, there’s a lot of people here who would
like to be your investor. Snowden just looked at him, puzzled, like–what
are you talking about? I’m talking about freedom and heresy and truth,
and being a dissident, and how a society corrects itself from manifest
injustices through allowing people who have an uncomfortable truth to
tell it. And you’re talking about startups? And it was just this
wonderful collision between someone who believes in real changes, and
these people who kind of believe in the pseudo-change that lines their
own pockets."

I think the discussion was trying to shoe-horn Snowden into some sort of heroic role that fits some ideas in the book, maybe. I've not read it, and as you say Snowden is a really bizarre case. Greenwald etc. cashed the fuck out, Snowden is living seemingly happily in Russia (the only person any "progressive" grants an immediate pass for happily working and living in Russia), and the whole affair more or less does look like a win for the US security services.
I did glance at the book's Amazon listing, and it has a hilarious little blurb from Bill Gates about being a must read, which seems hilariously ironic, based on how the book is touted.

against the money that the ruling-class oligarchs can come up with,

actively contribute to AP to make it happen, I just get the feeling
that the average American isn't going to chip in $5 to have their
local police station blown up (or whatever).
Of course, this is all presuming that any of the police states we
live in would ever let such a thing get off the ground. The technology
is not there yet. Will it ever be there, when the government is
tapped into central peering points all over the fucking world, and

LOL! That your thinking has only gone this deep on this particular issue,
“actors playing bad guys might be killed by the AP mob, so they will get to
demand a higher salary to pay their security retinue”, doesn’t show a whole lot
of deep thinking or intellectual curiosity, Jim :P.  I find your stories of IC
work much more interesting.
The way AP is designed, these “juries” (comprised of who?) are not a
requirement, and there could always be multiple AP markets, some with or without
these “juries”. Or some with wholly state-controlled “juries”.
What if state-actors were to put a hit on you?  And anyone else who has publicly
avowed for or otherwise is known to support AP?  That might serve as a slight
chilling concept on the whole thing.
Or maybe you’d be considered a martyr, as opposed to the victim of his own
murderous system, and the people would finally rise up and, as you say,  the
government would fall :P.

I will say this for newer protocols over stuff like email: there is often
the option for encryption (you can obviously encrypt your direct pop
or imap or even smtp connection to your outgoing mail server, but
almost certainly it will be transferred in the clear between mail
servers).  HTTPS is end to end encrypted without any need to bounce
the web page around the net in the clear.

“Gender identity law
The Ley de Género (Gender Law),[7] grants adults sex reassignment surgery and hormone therapy as a part of their public or private health care plans. The law also allows for changes to gender, image, or birth name on civil registries without the approval of a doctor or a judge.”

Those are all terrific choices. Lately I've been reading the "Revelation

opera thing going on (although there is no FTL, the science tries to be
grounded).. It doesn't really matter which book you start with, although
I really liked "Chasm City", which I think was one of the early ones. It
has lots of violence :)  (although not to levels of RKM or Joe Abercrombie)
It is important to remember that these are all pieces of fiction :) In
the real world, we are destroying the planet so that shareholder prices
keep going up, short term profits in exchange for long term existential
crisis, and it will only be the ultra wealthy who come out the other end
after "the Jackpot" (as William Gibson coined how he sees it playing out
over a 40-50 year period of humanity adjusting and losing like 2/3 of
its population, in the book "The Peripheral").

control planet-sized constructs made of "computronium", all of them
trying to accomplish the "Great Common Task" (which is uploading all
sentient beings, with or without their consent as I recall), and all
sorts of other dark shit in Hannu's stuff. Same with the Alistair Reynolds books I recommended - they are *not*

LOL! I've never read any of his novels, just a few short stories, a long
time ago. I can't remember what I thought of them particularly (which is
a bad sign I guess). But I know a lot of people dig it, and I think its
at least real literature, not "futurist" daydreaming. I think we are on the cusp of an existential crisis, and the world is
about to burn down around us ... :)  Literally, even.
Neal Stephenson used a nuclear-pulse ship, based on a lot of real
research that went into Project Orion, in Anathem. It's a cool idea, and
it's something humanity could more or less do right now - if the people
with the money had any interest in such things. I really like Anathem,
probably read it 3 or 4 times.. one of my favorite NS books.
I need to read some Vernor - I don't know his stuff at all, but actually
own a couple paperbacks (unread, obviously). Too many fucking books, too

Personally I wish the "progressive left" could get over its deep fear of

Those are all terrific choices. Lately I've been reading the "Revelation
Space" series by Alistair Reynolds - they have a bit more of a space
opera thing going on (although there is no FTL, the science tries to be
grounded).. It doesn't really matter which book you start with, although
I really liked "Chasm City", which I think was one of the early ones. It
has lots of violence :)  (although not to levels of RKM or Joe Abercrombie)
It is important to remember that these are all pieces of fiction :) In
the real world, we are destroying the planet so that shareholder prices
keep going up, short term profits in exchange for long term existential
crisis, and it will only be the ultra wealthy who come out the other end
after "the Jackpot" (as William Gibson coined how he sees it playing out
over a 40-50 year period of humanity adjusting and losing like 2/3 of
its population, in the book "The Peripheral").

Yeah, the brief "utopia" on Mars gets utterly destroyed (i think the whole
planet gets destroyed), there is a war between like 7 people who
control planet-sized constructs made of "computronium", all of them
trying to accomplish the "Great Common Task" (which is uploading all
sentient beings, with or without their consent as I recall), and all
sorts of other dark shit in Hannu's stuff. Same with the Alistair Reynolds books I recommended - they are *not*
utopian visions of the future, at all.

In sci-fi by Alistair Reynolds there is a certain faction called the Demarchists (or demarchy, but doesn't have the same connotation as the English word) - they all get a neural implant at birth that automatically polls them on every conceivable issue in their particular community, eventually it sort of faids to a low background noise in their head....

It's definitely not perfect. Just look at all the lynchings that took

It seems to me that "Frontier Justice" has historically been
justice at the whim of a whipped up mob. Now - does that make it any worse than the absurdly inhumane
mass incarceration and extrajudicial killings practiced by
state sponsored pigs all over the country today? Obviously, no ;)
I don't have a precise idea of how "justice" in an anarchist society would work, but it seems to me that there are a couple of things that are obvious. You have a right to protect your
person and and anyone else actively under attack, with whatever
force necessary.  Beyond that, I think total shunning of a bad actor
(refusing to participate in trade or any other aspect of the local society) might be the best way to get rid of them. Of course,
as with anything else, this system is also imperfect ;)

Not to be too much of a pedant, but I always thought William
Gibson coined the term cyberspace, first in (I think) the short
story Burning Chrome and then in the novel Neuromancer
(1982 and 1984, respectively).
I need to read True Names (thanks!) - although a cursory search
didn't find the phrase.

It's definitely not perfect. Just look at all the lynchings that took
place in the south after the civil war - nearly always of innocent
black men (although James would, ridiculously, argue otherwise).
It seems to me that "Frontier Justice" has historically been
justice at the whim of a whipped up mob. Now - does that make it any worse than the absurdly inhumane
mass incarceration and extrajudicial killings practiced by
state sponsored pigs all over the country today? Obviously, no ;)
I don't have a precise idea of how "justice" in an anarchist society would work, but it seems to me that there are a couple of things that are obvious. You have a right to protect your
person and and anyone else actively under attack, with whatever
force necessary.  Beyond that, I think total shunning of a bad actor
(refusing to participate in trade or any other aspect of the local society) might be the best way to get rid of them. Of course,
as with anything else, this system is also imperfect ;)

I still have a (very) badly worn paperwork that I picked up as a
kid in the 90s at a used book store ;) Nick Haflinger was (to my mind) never quite as "cool" as Case
or Bobby Quine, but it's a damn good book, way ahead of it's time...
it predates the Gibson stuff by nearly a decade.
I've been re-reading Borges recently. His ruminations on infinity are
an interesting prelude to cyberpunk and modern sci-fi in general.
Gibson rather shamelessly stole "the aleph" (name and all!) from
Borges' short story written in the 30s (or 40s?) for Mona Lisa Overdrive :)

You think we'll be able to map the relevant structure of a

gets everything in the end).
Of course, with all these advances we make, other shit slows us down.  Antibiotic resistance (and other treatment
resistant forms of disease) are becoming a serious problem. The Earth is being ravaged, various existential

It's been years since I used gentoo/portage, but my understanding is
that its trended towards binary packages.. of course, this may be a

I've noticed the same thing with FreeBSD - unless you keep your own
package repo with poudriere, or maybe portmaster or something,
trying to keep a mix of stuff installed via src, from ports, and
binaries installed directly via the pkg command, can cause some
issues. The.. "issues"..  are largely to do with whether you went
in and changed options in the `make config` stage of building a
particular port.  I suppose if you just built EVERYTHING from src
out of ports (which actually converts what you just built into a
FreeBSD txz pkg in the process of `make install`) and never installed
a binary package, it might not be such a big deal.. until you tried
to do a major OS update, via freebsd-update or via make
buildworld/buildkernel && make installworld/installkernel, in either
case you generally need to upgrade all your packages to use the new
ABI, if you're doing a major version jump.

Equal pay for equal work seems fair. For instance, America is built on

was more or less replaced with Jim Crow, and the "war on drugs",

What's your explanation, Juan? Your rhetoric seems to
come dangerously close to neo-nazism.... At least, the
anti-semitic bits.
Obviously what Israel is doing to the Palestinians is a
disgusting fucking atrocity. They are in many ways an American client state in the near/middle east, and recent developments under the current US regime
have been particularly egregious, at least symbolically
(e.g. moving the embassy to Jerusalem, recognizing it as
the capital, etc). Netanyahu loves Trump, heh.
Back to your original question, one line of thinking I've seen tossed around quite a bit is discussed at the following link (and no doubt in more depth in many other places, including the book being reviewed) -
Personally I dislike outright anti-semitism. It's ugly, it
makes me think of nazis, and all the ethnically Jewish folks that I've known fell somewhere on the spectrum from
homeless drug addict to "middle class" ... Although, I suppose that says more about me than anything else ;)

"antisemitic" is a bit of a misnomer. If you look at any dictionary definition of the word, its really only directed at

Sorry, I wasn't looking at the list yesterday. My spoofed header attempt used my actual cock.li login at port 587
of mx1.cock.li... I tried sending it with a "MAIL FROM: punk..", but those didn't go through, so then I just
used the same address I had authenticated with, and did an extremely rudimentary header spoof in the DATA section.  This made it through, although it had my cock.li address as a "Return-Path" in the headers, and then I sort of got bored and moved on to something else....
Of course, I tried just blasting it through cock.li without any SMTP authentication first, but as I suspected it's not
an open relay :). I had zero confidence that this would've worked but had to try. The whole point of doing the spoofed headers using cock.li's server was to make it look
authentic... You can spoof the headers from almost anywhere that lets you send SMTP but I wanted cock.li
servers to show up in the headers. I considered it a fail
because of what I mentioned in the first paragraph, but I haven't looked at the previous impersonation emails
closely enough to say for sure how they happened, but as
I recall they were better than mine (they were routed through cock.li servers but I don't remember any give-away "return-path" header or anything else). I'll take
another look at them when I have time to see what I may
have missed.

Thank you :)  I’m all healed up these days, as healed up as I’ll
ever be..  I got 95% usage in my leg back and, in my arm, I don’t
know - I can’t lift the left one above my head, but it doesn’t slow
me down too much.
And, I haven’t owned a bike in 4 or 5 years. In my riding days, I must've
been in at least half a dozen accidents, but they were (almost) all
minor - dropped the bike going downhill in the rain and the brakes
slid out, dropped the first bike I owned a couple times just learning
how to ride, stuff like that. The only BAD wreck was with an ancient
1989 Ninja 1000R that I picked up for a great price. It was well
past 20 years old at the time, but still beautiful and had great
potential before I destroyed it. As it was, I rode it around for a
few weeks, and it had a few issues - the suspension was screwy, and
it was running very rough. So, I got the carbs cleaned, and it
transformed the machine. The front wheel would pull up from stop
just from acceleration (and this was a heavy fucking bike) - it was
fast!  But, the suspension was still a little fucked up, and just
a few days out of the shop I flipped the fucking thing going about
45mph - broke my helmet in half down at the bottom where the face
plate came dislodged and slid down. I wouldn’t have a face if I
hadn’t been wearing a helmet :)
Anyway, I kept riding for a while after that, but for whatever
reason it’s been a while since I owned a bike.. although, I’ve been
feeling that motorcycle itch again lately… who knows :P
Hahah :)
Same to you Ceci - I hope you heal up & feel better soon!

There is a lot of blind faith in tech, a lot of hand waving about hard problems from ostensibly "smart" people.
Ray Kurzweil, who is 71, thinks he will live forever - he
predicts by 2029 medical tech will be at a point where
each year will add at least another year to your life span,
effective immortality.
He also thinks anthropic climate change (yeah, I know
Juan thinks it's all a big hoax, though I'm not clear who
benefits from such a hoax - massive vested interests in carbon fuel industries drive troves of billionaires, not
to mention entire nation states, but in any case) is nothing
to worry about - Moore's law applied to renewables, it's
no fucking problem :). It all sounds like technology as religious experience to
me.  Even if you buy into the inevitability of this future tech, is it really a road map for utopia? Humanity is facing some tough shit, much of it directly tied to tech progression: massive surveillance states on levels never previously imagined, wealth continually centralized among a tiny world elite, existential risks as a direct result of technological advances - atomic weapons, other "WMD", and of course turning the heat up on the planet by dumping carbon into the atmosphere at ever greater rates. It seems like we are on a race to destroy ourselves... Will
tech help us or hinder us? Imagine the "democratization of
high-tech" that comes with all this progress - what happens when anybody with the latest & greatest 3d printer and a few other relatively cheap odds and ends can create an atomic bomb?  What happens when gene
hacking becomes truly cheap and ubiquitous, and anyone with a little biology knowledge and the right hardware can
engineer a plague? What's the answer to the Fermi paradox?

It's a cynical way of looking at what seems to be a rapacious

ends, but "the gradual elimination of all forms of being worth caring
about" (not talking about the simulation hypothesis).
Yeah, I hope so. That's the positive way to think about it, and how I hope shit plays out - how it would have to have played out, all over the trillions of galaxies with billions of stars and exoplanets that make up the universe, over the past ~14B years. Of course, its also

I mean, it's just a model, and it has problems. But it also has had amazing

Anyway, it has fuck all to do with religion.  Einstein was ethnically Jewish, but he was also a genius. And an agnostic person of no particular religious faith (I think he identified with Spinoza a little bit, pantheism, which

If Lemaitre hadn't noticed it, someone else would've.  The big bang theory is
a result of observations of our expanding, red-shifted universe. All sorts of observations back up the general idea, e.g. cosmic background radiation.
Do I believe that the universe actually started from a literal "big bang"?  I have no idea, it seems odd. What was there before the big bang?  There are other
models, but at minimum it's an extraordinarily useful scientific model.
The standard model of particle physics (which actually excludes quantum mechanics)
How is it obvious that quantum mechanics is not "real science"?  We don't have a working unified field theory or a quantum model of gravity, but quantum mechanic effects have been observed in a
variety of ways. Though, I wouldn't vouch for any of the current crop of so-called "quantum computers" ;)
He was a European Jew - so the fuck what?  So were however many millions that died in the Holocaust.
I brought Einstein up specifically because he was ethnically Jewish,
but he was not a religious guy.  He was a scientist, and his early work
helped pave the way for the idea of the big bang.
I don't know what he thought about the big bang, although he pretty much hated quantum
mechanics ;).   The difference between all this and religion should be clear.  It's based on research, math, observation. It isn't absurd dogma handed down
in some crappy priest-fic to dominate a certain part of the population.
Should we say that giving the universe an age of 13.8 billion years (based on scientific shit like the big bang), or 6000 years (based on adding up the ages of the
fucking patriarchs in the bible ;) are both ridiculous fantasy numbers from the

So now you are saying, what, relativity is bullshit too?  Lol.  Newtonian physics don't keep satellites rotating around the earth, they don't do
shit really, if you care about accuracy.
Heavy atoms (heavier than hydrogen & helium) are forged in the hearts of stars.  Stars and planets form from the accretion of matter, due to gravity. Where did the shit all ORIGINALLY come from? I don't know, but the big bang

What I said about you not believing in relativity was in response to this comment, which you (accidentally, I assume) snipped -
You called ‘curved space time’ nonsense, which is the same as calling the theory of relativity nonsense. Which, unless Newton was

Newtonian physics.  Yeah, I suppose we should just blow up all the schools, and burn all the books. I know you’re thinking “only the books written by someone with a JEWISH surname” but, no, better to burn them all.  This is the way forward, again I have to agree :)

What you proposed was quite clearly said. You proposed using AP to kill car thieves and people that look at porn.
You talked about the difficulty in finding people who had committed such crimes (cuz how else do you put an AP hit out on them?)
Maybe, or maybe AP gets co-opted by the same powers running shit right now. Maybe they never let it take off. Maybe even if the tech is there, which it isn’t now, people are too fucking happy to get the latest gizmo from Apple and ignore the fact that they are slaves. Most people are not anarchists. Can the critical mass of well-intending users of AP, a group of which I don’t think I can consider you to be a member after your most recent suggestions, be depended upon to win in a fight to target and pay for assassinations against the billionaire ruling class and their government and corporate lackeys?
It is absolutely legitimate to find certain aspects of AP, or in this case how it would be implemented by you, and see obvious problems. How else do you problem solve or analyze the efficacy of.. anything?
I think people probably either see the limitations I’ve expressed, or they are part of that population that is disgusted by the idea and doesn’t really want to live in a world of escalating assassination wars.  I mean, it sounds like a cool video game :)
Sure, a simulation would be cool, even today. Neither of us can know how the outcome of a simulation would affect our thoughts on AP - until we see one, it’s pure conjecture.

All of this discussion is speculation Jim :).
The way I see it being co-opted is pretty simple:  govcorp uses its nearly limitless financial resources to target anyone who is pushing for AP in a way that would take them out of power. You don’t think they will fight with everything they have? They even have AP to use for their ends, because at this point AP has to be a system with perfect privacy (right? We hope so!), making government assassinations deniable.
Legit AP participants, by which I mean people not sanctioned by govcorp who are donating funds and killing the rich/politicians/law-enforcement/etc, would be vilified by the media and the vast majority of society would see AP as horrible criminality.  People don’t give a fuck about real freedom, not most of them.
The ruling class has too many resources. And some of your most recent statements paint AP in a fucked up new light. When the originator and biggest proponent of the idea has stated he thinks killing car thieves is a valuable usage of the tool, essentially portraying it as a replacement for the current criminal justice system, I think you lose another big chunk of sympathetic support. Murderous treatment of a mere thief is squalid, gross, and totally reminiscent of cops, jail, death row, torture, and the prison-industrial complex...
In danger of repeating myself, I think it boils down to a few things. Not enough “regular people” give a goddamn about freedom, toppling the government, etc. They are happy to shake a US soldier's hand and thank him for his service, they call cops when they have a problem, they just want a veneer of freedom and plenty of toys to buy.  Further, you’ve poisoned the well with some noxious ideas about minor shit. It seems to me AP is for war criminals, billionaires, people destroying the planet for profit, etc… not for minor thievery or other shit that, under the current system, would just land you on paper or in some part of the American gulag for a brief time.
Do you see a groundswell of support for anarchism in the wealthy American empire?  Take off the blinders man.  People are fucking stupid and mostly law-abiding “good citizens” who just want more money.
Crypto-currency is an important precursor to the technical problems of AP, but AP isn't just a technical problem.  The fact that people are investing in bitcoin to try to make a big score has fuck all to do with the ideas behind AP, which involves financing murder for the greater good (oh, and to deter car theft :).
You don’t think govcorp will do everything they can to protect their people? Their resources are vast and would be deployed as soon as the first AP hit happens (or the first AP hit is bungled, always a possibility with this).
Ok, you are the one who brought up simulations. I still think it would be fascinating.

Yes, in fact I'm surprised to hear you state it so baldly.  I guess I
should re-read your essays. I didn't realize you were simply attempting
to replace fucking "law enforcement officers" and the gulags & death
chambers they herd "criminals" into with your assassination program.
Thought such a plan is entirely in line with murdering someone for
stealing a car.
Surely the more noble goal would be to utterly destroy the very concept of the
"law enforcement officer", and his gulag along with it. Delegating "LEO"
to assassins paid by an anonymous mob - well, it might not be any worse
than the current situation, but it's not really progress is it?
Maybe I'm misreading you and when you talk about AP replacing the
current criminal justice system this is what you mean.
I can see that you're making an irrelevant and poorly constructed
argument :)  For one thing, I layed out quite clearly what I think
the weaknesses of AP are, you can re-read my previous email if you
like.  It's pretty simple stuff - I lack faith in the "human spirit"
to prevail over the global orwellian nightmare into which we are
devolving, and disagree with you that the ruling class will accept
the assassinations of themselves or their henchmen without fighting

The infamous Morris Worm was released in 1988; making use of known vulnerabilities in Sendmail/finger/RSH (and weak passwords), it took out a metric shitload of SUN-3s and 4BSD Vaxen (the author claimed that it was accidental, but the idiot hadn't tested it on an isolated network first). A temporary "condom" was discovered by Rich Kulawiec with "mkdir /tmp/sh".
Another fix was to move the C compiler elsewhere.

Z**n likes Trump's rhetoric on nationalism and his general

I remember, I think this was before I filtered all his email, Z*n once
wrote a fucking paean to Putin. I suspect (I don't read his email
anymore) he feels the same way about Trump.  Kinda funny re-reading that old Putin love-letter - I think some of Putin's shirtless manly "just a
regular badass despot" pics must've got Z*n all excitable the day he wrote "One thing the naysayers against Putin have failed so far to produce,
is any evidence - that is, actual facts - in support of anything
other than Putin as a genuine and heartfelt man who cares
passionately for his country and further not only for the Russian
people both in Russia and the diaspora abroad, but for all humans on
this planet."  - ROFL -

On FreeBSD, it's as simple as running the following commands as root
# install tor
 pkg install tor
# set appropriate variables, there aren't too many to get going and
# you can find them all well documented  vi /usr/local/etc/tor/torrc
# update your rc.conf so the service will start at boot, then start it
 sysrc tor_enable=YES
 service tor start
For an idea of what the torrc file should look like, here is mine with a
few bits XXX'd out. My node is specifically configured not to allow exit
traffic because it was generating a lot of complaints upstream about my
host trying to hack peoples shit, etc :)  # cat /usr/local/etc/tor/torrc | egrep -v "^$|^

If you were doing this on Linux, it would be much the same. Replace the
"pkg install" with "apt-get install" or "yum install" or whatever, you
might have to add a tor repo or something. The config file probably
won't live under /usr/local/etc/tor, but just /etc/tor, and you'll use
systemctl rather than just updating the rc.conf with sysrc.
I would not recommend you run an exit node from your home ;)

What you are describing, if it doesn't already exist, would be trivial
to code for Windows (assuming standard tor binaries will run, win10 has fucking WSL or whatever, anyway im sure it does) or MacOS or
Linux..  like the tor browser, but even simpler: just a little graphical
applet that generates a torrc and starts up the tor daemon. Even makes sure whatever software firewall you are using has the right holes in it ;)

A more appropriate answer to your question would actually be
a pi or some SoC board with bare bones Linux or BSD OS and a version
of the little Tor wrapper app I described that had a really simple web
interfere and ran under e.g. nginx and php (or whatever).  Put in a nice
case with an onion stamped on top.
And if that's really the only feature you wanted, I guess that's all it would do ;)

It would of course need an sd card for the OS install.
There are probably cheaper SoC offerings that are fast
enough, but the rpi4 is a good choice, easy to work with.
I tend to agree.. if run from residential connections it would
make more sense to not try to use a huge amount of bandwidth,
and running an exit node will almost certainly bring trouble.
Then again, different providers offer and impose different levels of
scrutiny. Whatever the end product is it should be fully configurable,
but at a bare minimum the user should be able to control all the bandwidth settings and whether or not it's an exit node in a simple VPS' are dirt cheap, and can be spun up with Linux or FreeBSD and
tor very quickly and easily. Not quite meeting Jim's requirements,
but it's really not that high a burden of technical knowledge to do, for those truly interested...

One of the things that struck me is that it seems most (none) of the

They were people being targeted for the same old stupid reasons idiots
