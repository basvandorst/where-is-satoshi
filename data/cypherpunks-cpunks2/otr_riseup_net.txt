@_subject: WaPo releases details on US offensive cyber-ops 
Greg, et al -- I'm going to keep digging on US cyber operations, and particularly on "computer network exploitation" and "computer network attack." I'd be interested in theories, questions or suggestions from the smart folks here as I think about my reporting strategy. --Bart

@_subject: Threat model: Parents 
Honestly, people, some of these suggestions are like a parody of geek advice to civilians ;-)
The kid will soon hit upon the same practical solution that his or her peers all use: the smartphone (preferably with a VPN like Freedome), plus browsing at a friend's house. Wiping, Linuxing and LUKSing a family PC will escalate the real-life threat, and the kid's defenses will fall quickly to the parental equivalent of that XKCD password cartoon. If the kid has a need for full size keyboard and screen, and has a few more technical chops than most, there are some alternatives:
 * Boot up Tails in Windows camouflage mode. Choose More Options at boot. Shoulder surfing will probably bust him/her anyway, sooner or later.  * Make one of those WinPE Windows USB drives, if real Windows is required. Last time I looked this wasn't that easy.  * Get a small, fast external drive and install the OS of choice. If the host is a Mac, use Carbon Copy Cloner (or dd) to copy an existing machine to the external drive, or do a fresh installation there. For Linux, choose your flavor.   * Get a Raspberry Pi and hook it to the keyboard and screen, at times when you don't expect interruption.   * A virtual machine may be possible on the monitored host, if the required drivers are already present. Probably not. See   If anyone knows a VM that works without admin rights, speak up. Barton Gellman
