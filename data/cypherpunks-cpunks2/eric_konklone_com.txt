"cryptography List" I know most of the people on here have transcended the earthbound, maudlin
Certificate Authority system, but as services-adopting-SSL-news goes, I'm
particular excited about Github
which started quietly supporting SSL for *.github.io domains a few weeks
I'm excited because Github Pages is powerful, verrrrry flexible, and
totally free. AFAIK, it's the only major blog/web host that gives you free
SSL, backed by a high quality CDN (since everything is static files).
To promote the occasion and nudge Github to take it further, I wrote up my
own experience, and a little how-to for forcing redirects via Jekyll:
Along with Cloudflare's 2014 plan to offer SSL termination for free, and
their stated plan to double SSL on the Internet by end of year, the barrier
to HTTPS everywhere is dropping rapidly.

@_subject: [cryptography] Github Pages now supports SSL 
For what it's worth, I think CloudFlare dropping the price of SSL is going
to force other companies to follow suit, so hopefully their move creates
competition that both reduces CloudFlare dependency and increases the
amount of encrypted traffic on the web.
For example, today I learned that Amazon CloudFront finally dropped the
price of SSL in front of S3 for custom domains from $600/month(!!) to
$0/month:  (As long as
you're comfortable using SNI, which excludes users on Windows XP.)
CloudFlare is hopefully just one part of the tip of the spear.

I've read the Intercept's writeup[1], and read through Citizen Lab's
writeup[2]. I'm having trouble understanding the attack surface, and how
widely applicable the vulnerability is.
Are MS and Google targeted because of their ubiquity, or is there also
something (besides not using HTTPS) that they did to make their services
How can there be a remote code vulnerability so low in the stack that it
can be injected at the packet level, but high enough that TLS encryption
foils the attack?
Does this affect Windows only? Through particular browsers?
I'm certainly up for using this as an argument for how difficult it is to
predict the severity and creativity of MITM attacks, but I would like to
better understand the magnitude of the disclosure.

@_subject: WebRTC for P2P [was Re: Replacing corporate search engines with 
I am a huuuge fan and optimist for WebRTC. It has only just barely begun to
be available in the latest stable versions of modern browsers, so we are
still in the calm before the storm of experimentation. (A bit like
WebSockets a few years ago, but the ramifications of P2P connections are, I
think, more profound than adding real-time capabilities.)
One website I use to get across the power of WebRTC is Sharefest:
It's file-sharing without a cloud. The central service just assigns UUIDs
and does the initial signaling, but the file transfer happens P2P. Extra
neat feature: the file and associated permalink stays "alive" as long as
any one person has their tab open. (It warns you if you're the last person
and you try to close the tab.)
As WebRTC gets mind-share and browser-share, I think you'll see a lot of
effort devoted to lowering the usability and accessibility barrier to
decentralized technology on the web.

The auto-update feature is a big deal that will have to get wrestled with

cryptographic concepts to convince governments to publish more unique

their *databases* is sensitive (like SSNs).
The problem of anonymizing unique data is in some senses easier than others
here, because in some gov't contexts, making things personally identifiable
isn't the problem -- the *intent* is to publish personally identifiable,
connect-able information, like for campaign donors and lobbyists. So the
Mosaic Effect (de-anonymizing Netflix data) is less of a concern. Depends

discourages other people from building it. You may not agree with him, but
he at least has what I think is a coherent security model that he's
sticking to.
Really great discussion on it here:
Namely, he trusts apps signed with his signature (a process he manages
using his own airgapped system) and that's it. *You* may not hinge your
trust of the application on his signature, but he does, and he wants
ideally every TextSecure install to have it.
Both threads above are from before the CyanogenMod deal. To make that
happen, Moxie's team built a secure self-update path for the app, which
removed most of the barriers to requiring Google Play.
The other main barrier is push delivery, which right now uses Google Cloud
Messaging. High quality push delivery to a kabillion devices is very hard,
and not easy to replace. However, Moxie has encouraged people to take
advantage of the server's WebSockets support, and to build an option for
that into the client if they want to remove the last barrier to Google
support -- while warning that WebSockets delivery will not be nearly as
good as GCM-based delivery.
I was talking with a friend about this over the weekend, and I think that
the push that's happening for fully reproducible builds -- where every
build produces an identical binary with an identical hash -- would resolve
some of the issues Moxie has.
Then, Moxie can sign the hash of the binary, and others who build the
source code or get binaries from other places can verify that hash. That
still requires some tooling or verification UX, and for builds to be
reproducible by other people than Moxie, but it could make a difference.

This isn't accurate, in practice. In theory, Google could replace any
certificate they want for first use. But they clearly don't do that for
everyone (Moxie or someone would notice), and if they did it in a targeted
way, it could only be on the first use. That's a threat vector, but only
viable under both targeted and specific circumstances.
So "what's to stop Google pushing a malicious TextSecure? Nothing. Nothing,
at all, ever." isn't accurate -- you can trust that you're highly likely to
get the real TS binary on first install, and then guarantee that you're
getting a binary signed by the same person for updates.
This is why Moxie uses TOFU for the TextSecure threat model itself. Yes, if
someone MITMs you and your friend the first time you talk, you're
compromised from then on, but in practice that's rare and difficult.
He clearly doesn't think much of F-Droid's build process, especially that
they don't keep the build and signing process fully offline. I think that
was generally his principal objection there.
There's a more general complaint he's raised as well, which covers the case
of hosting the APK on his own site, which is that (in his opinion) the
worst thing you can ask non-savvy users to do is check the box that says
"Allow unknown sources". I'm pretty sympathetic to this point of view, for
the general class of user. And it's the general class of user that Moxie's
interested in making inroads on with TextSecure.
Interestingly, I saw this malware alert today that addresses two of the
issues here:
The malware only affects people who download it from an unknown source,
*and* it's helped by the fact that apparently iOS does not enforce matching
certificates on app upgrades with the same bundle identifier. Apple's
depending on their App Store walled garden -- and the phone's lack of a
built-in "allow unknown sources" option for security.
In a sense, Google's allowing users to opt-in to the "unknown sources"
option, even when it raises a user's security risk, forces Google to
provide stronger security guarantees even for users who have that enabled.
But of course, that only addresses replacement of an existing app. As you
say, Android is TOFU for apps, so having "unknown sources" on means a user
is vulnerable to new app malware.
I feel like there's been a big mindset shift in the security community
about controlled app update vectors.
I know Google feels extremely strongly that auto-updating through a secure
channel (with pinned keys) is the way to go with Chrome. Both in terms of
ensuring that the app is only the one Google built and signed, and in the
overall security benefit of not having people lag behind on older browsers
for 10 years.
I've really been enjoying (seriously)  on Twitter, and she
had a really interesting post on what security means for the general class
of people. It was very depressing, but also points to the direction we need

But he doesn't, and when I asked I finally got an answer: It's because
He's also expressed openness to a third-party replacement for this
functionality. It's not impossible to do that, but a high quality open
source replacement needs to be built first. Google Analytics has an Android
SDK, but it is closed-source.
This is the same issue as Google Cloud Messaging: the requirements are
high, but an alternative is welcome.
I do wonder how he's managing analytics on the CyanogenMod pre-install --
I'd guess CyanogenMod has their own analytics infrastructure he's
piggy-backing on.
I believe it's being presented as both a threat model, and a set of feature
requirements. I wouldn't call needing device analytics just "convenience"

@_subject: Doing HTTPS everywhere in the .gov space 
I wrote a piece today for my organization, 18F, about our HTTPS-everywhere
policy for the .gov websites we build inside the US government:
I wanted to give this list some extra context, since I understand the US
government is a big, complicated, freighted topic. Below is my *personal*
attempt to describe my workplace and is not anything close to an official
description or the voice of the government.
18F[1] is a team of ~70 people working as full time employees inside the US
federal government. (The name comes from the street intersection -- 18th St
& F St -- that its HQ is at in DC.) 18F as a unit was created around a year
ago to be a competent, top class in-house technology team for the US
federal government.
A driving idea here is that the government shouldn't need to outsource its
*entire* technical brain to contractors, and that government services can
be simple and even beautiful. If you've noticed what's happened over the
last few years in the UK at  by the Government Digital
Service[2], 18F takes a lot of inspiration from them.
18F is housed inside the General Services Administration, an independent
federal agency[3] that does as many different things as its name implies,
from running all the buildings to housing the nation's data catalog at
Data.gov. It's an "independent" federal agency in that it's not subject to
the same level of direct executive and White House control that cabinet
agencies are. It's the same kind of "independent" that lets the FCC
potentially disagree with the President on net neutrality, for example.
The team has people all over the country (it has a big SF office, for
example), many of which have either never been in government before, or who
came in after doing the Presidential Innovation Fellows[4] program.
I joined 18F after working for 5 years on open data apps, infrastructure,
and policy at the Sunlight Foundation[5], a non-profit in DC that pushes
for open government. I had also done a fair amount of work around privacy,
HTTPS, and ongoing judicial activity around surveillance. I get to continue
doing all of that work in my personal capacity.
I say this just to try to communicate that the 18F team has some very
sincere people trying to make the US government work better for people all
over the world, and to do right by technology in the process. We have
substantial support and autonomy to make that happen.
When it comes to HTTPS, the .gov surface area is absolutely enormous, and
moving it helps move the whole Internet forward. Bringing the government in
line with the rest of the web/security community (and being loud about it)
is one of my big priorities at 18F, and so I wanted to share this here with
you all.

I wasn't trolling. I've been a member of this list, and paying close
attention to the field, since well before I joined the US government (which
happened back in May).
Before this, I worked for 5 years at a relatively adversarial non-profit
group focused on government transparency, called the Sunlight Foundation.
I also did personal work on furthering encryption and drawing attention to
government surveillance:
I still work on them, and stuff like it, in my personal capacity. I'm on
the record in all kinds of places, in my personal capacity, supporting what
Edward Snowden did and pushing for technical changes and policy reform to
curtail surveillance.
I completely expect (and find welcome and appropriate) high levels of
skepticism for anything the US government does. All I can tell you is where
I'm coming from, and the actions my team is taking.
In my government capacity, when  is operational next
year, I hope to get as many .gov domains to use their certificates as I can.

That's my memory as well. I also don't remember any cognitive dissonance
between Poitras' and Greenwald's answers to Snowden's question about how
much background to go into. The film doesn't portray a lot of daylight
between Snowden and Greenwald in what they want to do, really.
But that's what you should expect from the movie, I think, given a) how
close Poitras and Greenwald are, and b) that the movie is clearly meant to
tell Snowden's story and show his motives and impact, not amplify any drama
between the people involved.
The movie didn't cover, for example, Greenwald misleading the entire world
on why David Miranda was detained at the Heathrow airport. Greenwald
initially insisted it was simply the gov't applying pressure on Greenwald
by harassing his family, lambasting the government as cruel despots, and
didn't say anything about Miranda carrying an encrypted hard drive. You can
still criticize the government for detaining him how they did, but lying
about the reasons, to get an edge on defining how the news cycle talks
about it -- that corrodes trust.
But, you know, that's fine, that's for others to tell. CITIZENFOUR is about
Snowden's decisions, not Greenwald's decisions, and it does a great job at
communicating and humanizing them.

John, that was a beautiful email.
I sincerely hope it is both the introduction and the coda to this
intersection of cpunks and GamerGate. Let's just move on from here.

That's my memory as well. I also don't remember any cognitive dissonance
between Poitras' and Greenwald's answers to Snowden's question about how
much background to go into. The film doesn't portray a lot of daylight
between Snowden and Greenwald in what they want to do, really.
But that's what you should expect from the movie, I think, given a) how
close Poitras and Greenwald are, and b) that the movie is clearly meant to
tell Snowden's story and show his motives and impact, not amplify any drama
between the people involved.
The movie didn't cover, for example, Greenwald misleading the entire world
on why David Miranda was detained at the Heathrow airport. Greenwald
initially insisted it was simply the gov't applying pressure on Greenwald
by harassing his family, lambasting the government as cruel despots, and
didn't say anything about Miranda carrying an encrypted hard drive. You can
still criticize the government for detaining him how they did, but lying
about the reasons, to get an edge on defining how the news cycle talks
about it -- that corrodes trust.
But, you know, that's fine, that's for others to tell. CITIZENFOUR is about
Snowden's decisions, not Greenwald's decisions, and it does a great job at
communicating and humanizing them.
