Interesting. And, yes, revoked keys remain on servers. That is the main target. People must be able to know if a key is or not

A bit interesting: As Sony has her PSN, how playstation owners are vulnerable?

Hello, guys
Keybase.io seems to be a great tool to create a true WoT. Are anybody in there? They are working with invitations.

More than only create a great documentation, the wrapper they wrote in NodeJS abstracts GnuPG commands making easy to any
un-technical person to use cryptography constantly. Of course a little bit of paranoya is always good, and I don't agree with the
idea to host my private keys in a server I don't control, even cyphered with a password, but I think it can solve the problem that
users forget or loose your keys and our keychain remains with unuseable, no revogated keys.

You don't HAVE to, but they give this possibility. You can (if you want) store your private key in Keybase. They ask you to cypher
your private key locally and send it to Keybase's servers. If you don't store your private key in its databases, you are unable to
use some online services they offer, like to sign documents. You only will be able to do that using his NodeJS tool. But, your
point is my point. I believe serious security professionals or people that understand the importance of cryptography first don't
will send the private keys for Keybase and, second, if they do, they will use a strong password. We never must forget
But, we know average people uses very weak passwords and only one password for everything. So, as I told, a little bit of paranoya
is good, and this "feature" makes me believe a little less in Keybase, unfortunatelly. The main idea is pretty good and I'm trying
to implement this culture in Brazil for a long time, but I use to say that ordinary people don't like computers: they like Skype,
Facebook, Instragam... So, people don't care about privacy. If the same people see that movie about Asange, or read his book, or
see the last news about privacy and Google and start to learn about cryptography, they will store private keys with lame
passwords, and we'll have this fraudulent cert risc.
In my opinion, nothing will replace a good key signature party, anyway.

We're talking about it the entire morning. Nice news for a halloween.
You got two great points. First of all I think they didn't catch the main point of TOR network. Otherwise, who's certifying SSL key?
About second question, or they made a commercial agreement with people in TOR OR they are able to spoof any .onion address. My
guess is for second one.
Why in hell somebody in TOR network will access facecrap? If TOR intent to give anonymous networking, why to use a service where
you get anything but be anonymous? Do this make sense?
In other hands, this is Chewbacca...
