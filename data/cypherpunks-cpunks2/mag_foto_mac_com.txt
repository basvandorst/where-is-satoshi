*A recent (and pre­dictably slanted) Wall Street Jour­nal arti­cle dealt with a leak of Naval Intel­li­gence secrets dur­ing the course of World War II.
Dis­clos­ing the piv­otal fact that U.S. intel­li­gence had cracked the Japan­ese “White Code” (not spec­i­fied in the WSJ arti­cle), “Colonel” Robert R. McCormick’s Chicago Tri­bune leaked vital infor­ma­tion for the sec­ond time in less than a year.
Hav­ing pre­vi­ously leaked the Rain­bow Five con­tin­gency plan for U.S. mobi­liza­tion and war-making doc­u­ments for the Sec­ond World War, McCormick was a mem­ber of Amer­ica First. Osten­si­bly iso­la­tion­ist and “patri­otic” in out­look, the orga­ni­za­tion was, in fact, actively funded by Third Reich intel­li­gence and com­prised (for the most part) of doc­tri­naire fas­cists who loved Hitler and Mus­solini and hated Franklin Delano Roo­sevelt with a passion.
(For a good under­stand­ing of the active pro-fascist nature of Amer­ica First, open Under Cover by John Roy Carl, son and use the “find” func­tion on your com­puter, search­ing “Amer­ica First.” This will yield a good under­stand­ing of the nature of that orga­ni­za­tion and its members.)
As dis­cussed in AFA  the prob­a­ble source of the leak of the Rain­bow Five pro­gram was Gen­eral Albert Wede­meyer, one of its pri­mary authors and an active Amer­ica Firster. (See text excerpts below for infor­ma­tion about Wede­meyer and the leak of Rain­bow Five.)
A lynch­pin of the China Lobby, the MacArthur group in the mil­i­tary and the milieu that coa­lesced into the  John Birch Soci­ety, Wede­meyer stud­ied at the Ger­man mil­i­tary acad­emy, begin­ning in 1936, rent­ing his apart­ment from Ger­hard Ross­bach, one of the lead­ers of the Brown­shirts (SA.) Later (as dic­sussed in AFA  Ross­bach went to work for the CIA in the post­war period. Yet another point about Wede­meyer set forth in AFA  is the fact that Ronald Rea­gan appointed Wede­meyer as a spe­cial mil­i­tary adviser.

Edward Snowden streaming LIVE at StartPage.com on November 10!
Edward Snowden
Join us on Thursday, November 10, for an exclusive free post-election livestream Q&A with Edward Snowden. The world’s most famous whistleblower will address questions about how the US Election results will affect your privacy and his pardon, as well as other questions submitted via social media.
We are thrilled to make this event available for viewing at  starting at approximately 4:30 PM Eastern time on November 10. The feed will be broadcast from the Pathé Tuschinski in Amsterdam where Snowden will be patched in to our live theater audience via satellite transmission from Moscow.
Edward Snowden became world famous after he handed journalists classified documents detailing the global espionage activities of the United States National Security Agency (NSA). Snowden’s exposure of covert government surveillance put privacy firmly on the map, but also put him at great risk. He was forced to flee the US in 2013 to avoid arrest and currently resides in Russia, where he has been given asylum.
“Edward Snowden’s revelations about government spying and mass data collection are of crucial importance to our society, but he had to sacrifice his free life for it,” said Robert Beens, CEO of StartPage.com. “We are proud to honor his service and help bring his privacy message to the world.”
Special thanks to the Freedom of the Press Foundation and Edward Snowden’s attorney Ben Wizner of the ACLU’s Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project for helping make this historic event possible. We are also grateful to Amnesty International and PardonSnowden.org for sponsoring a petition that asks US President Barack Obama to pardon Edward Snowden before leaving office in January 2017.
Livestream Q&A question suggestions may be submitted now through November 9 using the hashtag  We look forward to seeing what you would like our moderator to ask Mr. Snowden.
The live event will start at approximately 4:30 PM Eastern time and can be seen here.
Thank you for caring about privacy!

I conclude that the goal of the censorship is not to promote Core's
roadmap, per se, but rather to continue to grow the divide in the
bitcoin community and foster discontent.
Yet another tactic of the disruptor is to label your opposition as
"conspiracy theorists" for daring to entertain possibilities like the
one you just outlined.
Everyone should read this: Literally every single one of these tactics is at play here.
Note that I'm not making the logical leap and concluding that this
whole charade is a top-down effort to subvert Bitcoin, but we should
be able to discuss the possibility (precisely because it is a
possibility) without being labeled tinfoil nutjobs for doing so. If
there was an attack on bitcoin, what would it look like?
