@_subject: [liberationtech] Defeating massive wiretapping with opportunistic, 
thinking on how to practically challenge the massive wiretapper
(interceping on telecommunication lines/fibers/internet exchanges),
there is a general acceptance that "opportunistic encryption" systems
could be a good approach.
To protect against massive wiretapping of SMTP email that's the approach
already discussed here:
To protect against massive wiretapping of HTTP traffic, the general
understanding is to use HTTPS.
However HTTPS have several serious drawbacks:
- The owner of a website have to pay "more" for the security of it's
web-clients (buy a digital certificate)
- The owner of a website have to pay "more" for the hosting of an HTTPS
site vs. HTTP site
- If the owner of a web don't pay more the end-user browser receive a
BIG SECURITY WARNING (self-signed certificate)
For the reason previously identified the "HTTPS" approach is still very
valuable but it does not scale up to protect against massive wiretapper
intercepting HTTP.
The idea to fix this problem by creating a technology that enable
opportunistic encryption of all data exchanged (via AJAX) by modern
javascript applications by leveraging unathenticated TLS with DHE
ciphers (providing Perfect Forward Secrecy).
This could be realized by providing a "thin" layer of integration into
any existing Javascript application to wrap the XHR/Ajax requests,
proxying them trough a Javascript TLS Client, with some server-side code
acting as a gateway/minimal TLS implementation working within an HTTP in
HTTP tunnelling model.
If a techology like that would exists, it would be possible to integrate
it as part of Wordpress or Django or other commonly used web
This would provide by default unauthenticated TLS encryption for most of
it's web traffic, with perfect forward secrecy, without HTTPS.
I tried to summarize the idea on the Forge (Javascript TLS stack) github
issue at  .
I know that this kind of argument attract crypto-trolling ("Javascript
encryption" and "Unauthenticated encryption" and "Opportunistic
encryption") but i think that it's worth discussing because it could be
a revolutionary approach to challenge massive wiretapping.
What does various people think about this approach?

No protection against active attacks.
The purpose is to defeat massive wiretapping that's a passive.
Active attacks are mostly for targetted attacks, so outside the scope.
There was many interesting discussion about the likelyhood to implement

@_subject: In European Election Pirate Parties against Massive Surveillance 
Hi all,
i'm supporting Pirate Party (in Italy) for EU Election, that share a common European pirate party program (the same program in 9 EU states), with a clear and explicit commitment against massive surveillance and in favor of privacy.
I would love to see NGOs that are pro-privacy and against surveillance to support that point of the program of EU Pirate Parties publicly, calling for all digital rights activism communities across Europe to support that trough their own communities.
The full program is available at:
See the National Pirate Parties part of European Pirate Party  .
It would be valuable for the participants of the list that are in EU countries and that share those ethical values and principles to get in touch with their national Pirate Party to advocate those point of EU political programs.
Fabio Pietrosanti (naif)
Below snippets of the program against surveillance:
        Privacy and Mass Surveillance
Europeans have a proud history of fighting for their fundamental rights and the freedoms of their fellow citizens.
To preserve our rights and freedoms, and to ensure the effectiveness of law enforcement, Pirates demand that data collection and monitoring is limited to people who are suspected of committing or preparing a crime and requires judicial approval and oversight.
Adequate protection against crime is an important responsibility of the state. We must ensure this responsibility is fulfilled through an intelligent, rational and evidence-based security policy.
Pirates wish to abolish the practice of routine, automated and untargeted data collection, storage and matching. We reject the blanket and indiscriminate collection of communications data (data retention), traveling data (PNR) and biometric data. Pirates oppose the automated profiling of people to divide them into risk categories (“profiling”) at borders (entry/exit system).
Public spaces are full of cameras that monitor the movement of people and vehicles, track faces, and combine this information without considering the potential for the erosion of privacy. Evidence demonstrates that the presence of such systems has little effect on the rate of crime and that, at best, crime simply shifts to other spaces. Pirates support and would prioritize the movement of police personnel from monitoring duties, to patrolling the streets. Pirates are against individuals being required to identify themselves if they are not suspected of committing a crime, especially when they are exercising their rights to protest or assemble.
Pirates oppose the exchange of personal data with countries that lack effective protection of fundamental rights except in emergencies.
        Stopping New Surveillance Plans
Pirates want to stop the erosion of civil rights, that has taken on dramatic proportions in recent history. To ensure our safety, we do not need new surveillance laws, existing laws are sufficient.
In particular, we reject:
  *
    The proposal to make fingerprinting of all identity card holders in
    the EU obligatory.
  *
    Attempts to allow providers to retain communications data
    indiscriminately for “security” purposes in the context of the
    proposed ePrivacy regulation.
  *
    The proposed creation of a centralized EU Identity Register
    including fingerprints and facial images (“interoperability”).
  *
    Unilateral cross-border law enforcement access to data bypassing
    mutual assistance channels (“e-evidence regulation”).
  *
    Screening travelers using lie detectors („iBorderCtrl“ project).
        Systematic Evaluation of Existing Surveillance Powers and Moratorium
Pirates support well-reflected measures to keep us safe but intend to abolish harmful interferences in our fundamental rights. We, therefore, want the European Fundamental Rights Agency to systematically examine all current and future surveillance powers and programmes as to their effectiveness, cost, adverse side effects, alternatives and compatibility with our fundamental rights.
Pirates advocate a moratorium on any further interference with our human rights by the security agencies of the EU in the name of internal security until the systematic review of existing powers by the FRA is         Security Research
Pirates support the funding of research through the EU, however, the frequent involvement of government agencies in surveillance and filtering operations like INDECT and CleanIT demonstrates a clear intention to use such technologies in a way which makes them publicly funded tools for dismantling civil rights. We, therefore, argue that the EU must not fund technologies that limit fundamental rights.
        Protecting Our Privacy Online
The proposed e-Privacy regulation will update privacy rules for e-communications. We reject attempts to allow providers to retain communications data indiscriminately for “security” purposes. The collection or use of personal data for data trade, advertising or market or opinion research must be allowed only with the active and informed consent of the person concerned.
Additional Internet privacy legislation is needed to ensure that information society services can be used and paid for anonymously, and do not indiscriminately record our online activities. We intend to replace the surveillance economy with an anonymous micropayment economy.
The right to use encryption shall be guaranteed. Support for end-to-end encryption shall be made compulsory for manufacturers of telecommunications equipment. Transport encryption shall be made compulsory for telecommunications operators, especially operators of international cables. National and inter-EU communications shall no longer be routed via third countries to prevent foreign intelligence agencies from intercepting them.
        Export Controls of Surveillance and Censorship Technology
We support export controls of surveillance and censorship technology. We will not support the proliferation, by means of export credit or other state guarantees, of European-made surveillance and censorship technology to authoritarian countries that do not respect the rule of law. We will fight to uphold the privacy of journalists, activists and citizens around the world, by supporting legislation that prevents oppressive regimes from acquiring such technology and services from any entity in the European Union.
