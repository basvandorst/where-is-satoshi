Hash: SHA1
We do.
I can't speak for Haxwithaxe, but I took two weekend classes for the
Tech class licensing exam (total time: sixteen hours) and re-read the
course materials twice ( and passed
the exam on the first try.  I'm friends with a couple of hams in the
DC metroplex who aced all three exams (Technician, General, and Extra)
in one shot and know more about amateur radio and RF theory off the
tops of their heads than I do.
I think it depends on the ham you talk to.
Before taking the exam I studied the ARRL's official Tech class study
guide off and on for a couple of years (and did the practice sets for
every chapter) and it was easily the most difficult exam I've ever
studied for.  Then again, I'm a coder and not particularly skilled
with electronics (I thought operating systems and compiler theory were
That one has to study to take the amateur radio licensing exams puts a
lot of people off.  They just don't want to put in the effort "to sit
around talking to people."  I got that a lot from non-hackers when I
was studying for the exam in late 2011 and early 2012.  There is also
the (largely correct) perception that amateur radio equipment is very
expensive.  A lot of it is.  HT's (hand-held portable units) are much
less expensive (and getting cheaper - thank you, Baofeng) but the
common response is still "I don't want to sit around studying when I
could just talk on the phone."
One definitely has to put in much less work up front to be allowed to
chat on a cellphone.
Project Byzantium does.  We've done it around DC and in New York
City.  Do you have any specific questions on this topic?  Do you have
any specific questions pertaining to amateur radio and wi-fi (because
there is a bit of overlap)?
That may be why so many community wireless projects in the States draw
fire from telecom companies, but that's a rant for another mailing
list (such as IS4CWN).

@_subject: [hackerspaces] Byzantium Linux v0.3a is out! 
Hash: SHA1
ANNOUNCING BYZANTIUM LINUX V0.3a (Beach Cat)
Approved for: GENERAL RELEASE, DISTRIBUTION UNLIMITED
NOTE: This is Byzantium Linux for x86-compatible laptops and desktops.
This release is not compatible with the Raspberry Pi.  We just started
work on that port.
Project Byzantium, a working group of HacDC ( is
proud to announce the release of v0.3 alpha of Byzantium Linux, a live
distribution of Linux which makes it fast and easy to construct an
ad-hoc wireless mesh network which can augment or replace the current
telecommunications infrastructure in the event that it is knocked
offline (for example, due to a natural disaster) or rendered
untrustworthy (through widespread surveillance or disconnection by
hostile entities).  Byzantium Linux is designed to run on any x86
computer with at least one 802.11 a/b/g/n wireless interface.
Byzantium can be burned to a CD- or DVD-ROM (the .iso image is around
372 megabytes in size), booted from an external hard drive, or can
even be installed in parallel with an existing operating system
without risk to the user's data and software.  Byzantium Linux will
act as a node of the mesh and will automatically connect to other mesh
nodes and act as an access point for wifi-enabled mobile devices.
This release is unique because it is based upon the work we did in New
York City in the weeks following Hurricane Sandy in late 2012.  We
were asked by FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) to help
restore the telecommunications network in the neighborhood of Red
Hook, and the design requirements were dictated by the needs of the
community as described by leaders and elders.  v0.3a constitutes a
formalization of those requirements rather than the ad-hoc build we
deployed in Red Hook.
THIS IS AN ALPHA RELEASE!  Do NOT expect Byzantium to be perfect.
Some features are not ready yet, others need work.  Things are going
to break in weird ways and we need to know what those ways are so we
can fix them.  Please, for the love of LOLcats, do not deploy
Byzantium in situations where lives are at stake.
- - Binary compatible with Slackware-CURRENT.  Existing Slackware
packages can be converted with a single command.
- - Automatically configures itself on boot.  There is no longer a need
for a control panel.
- - Can act as a gateway to the Internet if a link is available (via
Ethernet or tethered smartphone).
- - Linux kernel v3.4.4
- - Drivers for dozens of wireless chipsets
- - KDE Trinity r14.0.0 (Development)
- - LXDE (2011 release of all components)
- - Mplayer v4.5.1
- - GCC v4.5.2
- - Perl v5.14
- - Python v2.7.3
- - Firefox v13.0.1
- - X.org
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (to use)
- - Minimum of 1GB of RAM (512MB without copy2ram boot option)
- - i586 CPU or better
- - CD- or DVD-ROM drive
- - BIOS must boot removable media
- - At least one (1) 802.11 a/b/g/n interface
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (for persistent changes)
- - The above requirements to use Byzantium
- - 2+GB of free space on thumbdrive or harddrive
WHAT WE NEED:
- - Developers.
- - Developers!
- - DEVELOPERS!
- - No more Bill Ballmer impersonations.
- - People running Byzantium to find bugs.
- - People reporting bugs on our Github page
(  We can't fix what we
don't know about!
- - Patches.
- - People booting Byzantium and setting up small meshes (2-5 clients)
to tell us how well it works for you with your hardware.  We have a
hardware compatibility list on our wiki that needs to be expanded.
- - Help translating the user interface.  We especially need people
fluent in dialects of Chinese, Arabic, Farsi, and Urdu.
- - Help us write and translate documentation.

they can intercept components and replace them with boobytrapped look-

Firmware bootkits are also potential vectors.  Why go to the trouble

Proof of concept was been proven in 2010.  Practical application is
probably being done by now.  Somebody is asleep behind the wheel if it

Hex-encoded blobs, if not binary blobs that show up under /lib/firmware.
Subverting hardware during design means getting lots of engineers in
the private sector to shut up.  That is not always easy.  Spending
time reversing the binaries they require (which few people do anyway)
and developing a version that is subverted requires keeping the lid on
fewer people, and can be done entirely in house (i.e. without telling
the manufacturer).
Did somebody mention looking for outbound UDP packets encrypted with
RC-6 or something?
That would work so long as the radio is not otherwise in use.  Radio
chipsets can be flipped around but it generates heat and uses up power
faster.  It should be more detectable than a subverted hardline.
Until somebody that works there blabs about it.  Is that a risk an
intel agency would accept?  Good question; my wild-assed guess is 'no,
not these days'.

- From the official announcement:
"We decided to use SSL atop this service due in part to architectural
considerations - for example, we use the Tor daemon as a reverse proxy
into a load balancer and Facebook traffic requires the protection of
SSL over that link. As a result, we have provided an SSL certificate
which cites our onion address; this mechanism removes the Tor
Browser's ''SSL Certificate Warning'' for that onion address and
increases confidence that this service really is run by Facebook.
Issuing an SSL certificate for a Tor implementation is - in the Tor
world - a novel solution to attribute ownership of an onion address;
other solutions for attribution are ripe for consideration, but we
believe that this one provides an appropriate starting point for such
They definitely have the processing power to brute-force a vanity
.onion address - who-knows-how-many data centers around the world
worth of processing power.  We don't know how long they've been trying
to generate a memorable one, either.  It could have been weeks or months.
Reportedly, Runa Sandvik and Steven Murdoch advised them on this
project.  Maybe they can shed some light on this.

Whether we on the cypherpunks list like it or not, people organize
protests and direct action on Facebook.  That is one of the reasons
why FB gets filtered occasionally around the world.  While this does

get as many bugs shaken out as possible and update the runtime disk
encryption code for newer operating system releases.  I also recall

I thought the point being made in the conversation was (and correct me

security audit on them.
Not to say that you're wrong, you make a good point, but it's taking
the discussion in a different direction.
We were talking about open CPU designs, so why keep them a secret?
Yeah.  It's pretty cool, isn't it?
That's a few degrees off-center from where the discussion was going,
but go ahead.  We'll fork() as necessary.
Or the electromechanical processing rigs that a few people have been

So what you're basically saying is that the entire tech stack, all the

basically completely untrustworthy.  There is no way at all to trust
anything that we can't actually see the logic gates of with the naked

in with the injection of boobytrapped packages to ensure that designs

that we have a workable way of detecting and mitigating the attack
(try it, it works!)).  Then someone else chimes in with "Well, we
can't even trust the FPGAs or the gate synthesis software for the same
reason."  This is yet another iteration of the same loop on this

didn't change between iterations.
I suppose what I'm bitching about (and I've probably just faceplanted
by stepping into that particular pothole - it's my turn, I guess) is that
there seems to be no part of the threat model where risk is
acceptible.  I mean, going all the way back to hand-wired
electromechanical processors just to be able to bootstrap back to
silicon and losing 20-30 years of technical advancement?
Somewhere, we went way off course.  There is a saying: "Perfect is the

To put it another way, might someone have seen it nearly a year ago but kept quiet because they did not want to kick off a flamewar of this nature.
I do wonder if that might be the case.  There is no data to back it up one way or another, so that is all it can be, though.

It's pretty straightforward to do.  Just make sure they're on different channels for best efficiency (took me a couple of hours to figure that one out... oops.)

People are so trained to think in binary terms that pretty much every possible shade of grey is all but invisble.

It makes one wonder how well it works in the context of node.js, which seems to be the darling of developers the world over these days.

Most of the projects out there are using OLSR (  A few are using the Babel protocol (
n.b., there is a difference between using a mesh networking protocol to distribute routes, and using IP forwarding to actually push the packets around.  The two together are required.
Most wireless mapping software out these doesn't see interfaces in ad-hoc mode, only infrastructure mode.  Thus, Wigle may not be the best way of mapping mesh networks in the greater context of wireless access points.
Wi-Fi direct is useful for short range comms.  We've had a lot of trouble making it work over longer ranges.  Wireless radios designed for use in infrastructure mode (including emitted power and duty cycle) are more reliable in the field.
Another standard.  Yay.  Time to find the docs and start reading...
There are other discovery models in use.  It'll be interesting to see how they compare.

It's an okay networking technology.  It's a few generations behind what we're actually fielding these days but they're using OLSR for maintaining the routing table, so that's something.  It's also hams only, so I'd advise caution if you don't have your ticket but want to experiment with it, new nodes that aren't recognized will draw a lot of attention.
One of the gotchas from their FAQ: "You can't use Wi-Fi to connect to a mesh node from your computer, netbook, smart phone or other wireless device."  Back to hardwiring.
Go Ubiquiti.  Linksys hardware is bobbins these days.

The Freifunk folks are good people and do good work.  It's definitely worth looking at their software and getting in touch with them.  They're also working in a much more friendly regulatory environment.

If the argument that we're all screwed anyway is made in a sufficiently
detailed way, and the technique described can be reasonably implemented by a
sufficiently motivated actor (a single person at the very least)... why
bother responding?  If things are as bad as you say, what's the point?

They already have what amounts to an internal counter-intelligence
unit that occasionally runs mole hunts looking for employees that
leak information on upcoming products or projects to the news media.
I'm kind of surprised they're not doing this already.
