How, precisely, compared to what we have now?
My and most cryptoanarchist's hope, I believe, is the precise opposite. At least I think BitCoin is woefully inadequate in the anonymity department, and should be made better so that no action group, government, anybody at all, can trace godfuck about what happened with it. Most certainly that "dirt" is just the killer app for any and all crypto currency. Not a bug, but the primary feature of the arrangement.
I on the other hand worry about how much transparency such intermediates still afford. Because there should be none at all. Full opaqueness is what we ultimately strive for. Or why do you think anybody would want to go with crypto in the first place?
Good money is *individual*, *distributed* power. Not power in the sense of a central despot. It's power in the sense of power to the people, individual and several.

In general, why does anybody do anything but binary formats in crypto, anymore? They just invite all sorts of padding trouble and what the hell not. If you have a clean proof, even against an oracle model, in something as beautiful as GF(2^8), why the *fuck* do you have to mess it up by translating to those very linefeeds and shit you usually really don't understand nor mostly can do right in the first place?
Just goddamn dump the bits. Pretty much everything is 8-bit-clean nowadays. Nobody sends email anymore. TCP most _certainly_ is 8-bit-clean. Fucking dump it down the socket, guarded by a proper MAC. How difficult is that to comprehend, really?

So is yours: obviously you can *have* and *use* it, it's just that you can't *export* it to the *terrorists* and the rest of the bad people who aren't you.
Perfectly consistent. Of course perfectly fucked up from the viewpoint of a foreign libertarian like me as well. But it really is fully consistent, and it was so from the very start, right downto the basic classical liberal ideology I as well share: "there is only one correct law, it is universal, if you don't share it then you haven't Been Enlightened yet, and thus we for very good reason don't Mind you too much". "Till you join our movement of universal rationality..."
So, then, as it's basically a valid argument, how about taking its contraposition? "As we then already know crypto is right, and it'ss used by precisely the right, righteous people all round, should it not be the case those who make a claim against are simply wrong."
Should it not in fact be, that making a case against free crypto should be taken as a prima facie case of the speaker being a fascist, against democracy, a luddite, and an all-round bad guy? Out to get immortalized as the next Hitler?

Isn't the whole point that "they" will always phrase this sort of thing to an individual's disadvantage, against the constitution and human rights, and that then the only way to fight such tyranny without killing yourself and/or embarrasing them is to have a popular standpoint and/or enough of an extant legal fund. I mean, obviously not to defend yourself, because you can never succeed in that, but in order to make you an unattractive target to begin with? Mutual assurance of destruction, and all that.

The one password they could never divine is \epsilon\epsilon. Two empty strings in a row.
Now I can see how some of you might object that it's then just one empty string in whole. I disagree: whoever told you passwords have to obey normal monoidal string axioms? Quite certainly arbitrary amounts of non-visible, un-greppable, in-representable void between and on characters *will* prove an un-stoppable counter-measure.
Truth be told, every *nix installation really should have available 1) a commonly available dictionary, 2) a true/hard randomness source (don't go there), 3) an easily usable means of combining your own off-the-cuff source of randomness with whatever you get from your hardware, 4) a cryptographically speaking hard mixing function, and 5) a stupid-as-fuck freeware utility to fold all of that into an XKCD-hard password. Preferably the lot residing in its hard parts on your Android device's tamper-resistant whatchamathinga, with open interfaces and a dozen or so independent implementations of each part.
Of course you can attack something like that. Duh. But compared to what we have now, it'd be a total hoot.
