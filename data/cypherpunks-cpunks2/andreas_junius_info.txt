Funnily enough, terrorists aren't using e-mail anyway. They announce their attacks and the results on facebook and twitter for everyone to read.

Following Paris attacks, encryption services face new scrutiny Alyssa Bereznak, Yahoo Tech By Alyssa Bereznak, Yahoo Tech .A crowd near the Eiffel tower a week after the start of the Paris attacks. (AP Photo/Laurent Cipriani) A crowd near the Eiffel tower a week after the start of the Paris attacks. (AP Photo/Laurent Cipriani) Four days after the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks that shook Paris, Pavel Durov, the founder and CEO of the messaging app Telegram, posted a photo on Instagram of himself on a balcony in France. In the image, he is dressed in black and looking off to the side, the Eiffel Tower in the background framing his stoic expression. If you saw it at a glance, you’d think it was a tribute to the mourning nation. But then there’s this caption: “I think the French government is as responsible as ISIS for this, because it is their policies and carelessness which eventually led to the tragedy,” it reads. “They take money away from hardworking people of France with outrageously high taxes and spend them on waging useless wars in the Middle East and on creating [a] parasitic social paradise for North African immigrants. It is a disgrace to see Paris in the hands of shortsighted socialists who ruin this beautiful place.” Though otherwise confusing, the statement made one thing clear: Durov would rather blame the tragedy that had befallen Paris on French taxes than call attention to the way members of the Islamic state have taken to using his encrypted messaging app to communicate. Funny that obviously everyone is convinced ISIS would use encryption and the only solution being mass surveillance. The opposite is the case, they do everything in the open, for everyone to read. Example:  page 72. The lead terrorist of Paris Abdelhamid Abaaoud giving an interview and announcing the attacks.
Maybe the intelligence services should simply read the news.
