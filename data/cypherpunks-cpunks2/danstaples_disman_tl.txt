It's even more absurd considering the inevitable progress of technology
over the next 10 years of Hammond's sentence. If we do our jobs right,
everything will be using encryption by then. This could have the effect
of simply barring him from using any sort of communicative digital
technology...making many everyday tasks impossible.
The only exception in the sentence is his use of encryption as required
by employment. But it's hard enough for ex-felons to find a job after
getting released as it is...

I hope you realize I was making a point about the challenges of
ex-felons in general, and not making a judgment on Hammond. He is
obviously brilliant and courageous, and many activists with the
ability to hire employees would be more than willing to help and
employ him when he gets out...
Witnessing his sentencing yesterday was physically sickening, and
definitely the worst abuse of our "justice" system I've ever seen. I
can only hope it inspires, rather than intimidates, other activists
and hackers to continue the type of work that he did.

I would be interested to see the details of the exploits you
witnessed/were subject to (especially since I was at DC20). How exactly
did you determine how the exploits occurred, and who was responsible for
them? How are you certain the DC19 attacks utilized DRT tech?

@_subject: PayPal freezes MailPile's account 
Why did they use Paypal? Probably because they are aspiring to gain
popular attention and support, and most people don't use Bitcoin; they
use Paypal and credit cards for online transactions.
Of course Paypal is a liability in terms of privacy and the risks of
them doing something just like what they did, but if MailPile hadn't
gone with Paypal, it's likely they wouldn't have gotten the amount of
funding that was donated so far. It's always a tradeoff of risk,
especially when you're aiming to go mainstream.

Keep in mind that using burner phones does little to nothing to provide
anonymity, especially when facing a state-level adversary. It's the
patterns and connections in your communications habits that give you
away, and burner phones won't hide that:
