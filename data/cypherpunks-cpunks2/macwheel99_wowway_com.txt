I think that solving unlicensed drones will be simpler to solve than 3d
printers making banned products, and products which need licenses.
It is illegal to make a gun totally out of plastic parts, which can go thru
airport and other metal detectors without being detected.  That ban worked,
until 3d printers.  3D printers now make all sorts of guns.  I saw some
tested on TV news, including multi magazine capacity assault weapons.  They
only get off a few shots, then break, but that technology will soon be
With drones, simply have a law saying that any drone outdoors, or on private
property, must have some standard means of identifying their registration,
when asked, and if fail to do so, their owners have no recourse if they get
shot down.  Either they have printed labeling visible from the ground, with
the name of their operating organization, or they respond on the kind of
frequency used by air traffic control, with the kind of transponder a
commercial piloted aircraft uses.

This article demonstrates a problem in how information gets communicated.
1.    Something happens, technology development, a disaster, a crisis.
2.    Millions of people react.
3.    News media writes about a slice of this.
4.    Thousands of people react to the news media, with parallel thoughts
5.    Hundreds of people may decide to try to DO something constructive
6.    They are operating in isolation from each other, the overhead of
having an organization, figuring out how to manage it, draining a lot of
IRAC = International Committee for Robot Arms Control
 y-to-limit-war-robots/ -space-military-bots-pleads-arms-control-committee They have had international conferences in different nations, proposed
conventions, worked on them, promoted them.
Yet, years after they started to make progress, someone who works in the
same area of expertise (international arms control) is proposing we do, what
they have been trying for years.  She is not alone.
There is also:
HRW = Human Rights Watch, an NGO
They have an effort to have autonomous weapons, without a human in the loop,
banned.  They have published a lot about this, and got a lot of reaction:
(a)   There are people in denial this is a problem.
(b)  There's a lot of debate in some academic and legal circles, regarding
their premises, approaches, practicality.
(c)   I don't like some things which are being said about
(d)  Laws, and treaties, against things don't stop the things.  There has to
be competent regulation enforcement with all relevant leaders on board.
American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Robots
I found out about it thanks to drone-list.
I have memory of other groups, but can't find the citations in the rapid
search I checked this morning.
The current UN investigation, into war crimes by drones with
humans-in-the-loop, may have some results which are relevant.
In addition to the Patriot anti-missile system mentioned in the article,
there are variants such as the Israeli Iron Dome, and the US Navy AEGIS
system, which connects various types of ship weapons to radar, other
detection systems, evaluates threats, shoots them down, without a human in
the loop.  I believe the Vincennes shot down an Iranian airliner, using the
AEGIS system.
I have much more in my DRONE ROBOT notes.

@_subject: [drone-list] Beltway bandits fly armed drones 
In our studies of drone crashes, we found multiple instances where the armed
drone was being flown by personnel, sub-contracted to the US military, to
carry out the warfare.  This was logical, given the large volume of
sub-contractors used in recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Now comes journalism investigation into how widespread the military use of
drones is really by sub-contractors, and not US armed forces, nor NATO
allies, nor CIA personnel, nor equivalent personnel of the intelligence
agencies of our allies.  This may be a violation of US government policies,
easily changed to retroactively permit this stuff.  It might not violate UK
rules, but implementation may be contributing to excessive crashes.
ary/ Britain supposedly has just as many drone strikes in Afghanistan as the USA,
so maybe a UK drone did the mysterious Pakistan Feb 6+8 strikes?

I am finding some older stuff. I did not notice it at the time it originally
was published.  It is still good stuff.
Big Picture (only topic in this installment)
 Control Tower audio from JFK sighting of a drone, or a UFO or whatever.
If there had been a collision, it probably would not have done as much
damage as Canadian Geese in Miracle on the Hudson, but timing is critical
during landing and taking off, when airplane has to throttle down so as not
to violate noise rules for people who live under airport flight paths.
Next generation of drones, which the public is allowed to see.
One of the people, commenting on this, asks how drone deaths compares to
deaths thanks to the other side, such as suicide bombings.
A good place to put that in perspective is Pakistani Body Count
 [1] which tracks both drone attacks
(by USA), and suicide bomb attacks, both of which allegedly kill a hell of a
lot of innocent civilians, even though the USA claims not to be deliberately
targeting non-combatants.
*        According to  in
Pakistan 1995-Feb 18 2013 there have been 375 attacks by suicide bombers
o       They killed 3,886 to 5,533
o       They injured 8,536 - 14,463
*        According to  in Pakistan
2004-Feb 08 2013 there have been 336 attacks by drones
o       They killed 1,675 to 3,144 of whom 1,250 to 2,488 were innocent
Pakistani civilians
o       They injured 330 to 1,215
*        The variations in numbers are because of different stories,
uncertainties, other reasons explained in some analyses, such as Living
under Drones in Pakistan.  democracy/?gclid=CP-L0Z7d-7UCFc19OgodBhIA7A Bill Moyers explores moral and legal implications of using drones to target
our enemies - both foreign and American - and other intelligence issues

Committee on Intelligence and former deputy legal adviser to the C.I.A.'s
Counterterrorism Center, and *        Vincent Warren, Executive Director of the Center for Constitutional
Iraq is supporting the Assad regime in Syria.  The US is now using drones to
attack our former allies.  This is a confusing situation.
The USA spent billions of dollars and the lives of nearly 4,500 soldiers in
Iraq, fighting to put down a Sunni insurgency that was described as a grave
threat to American interests. Today, the US government policy is assisting a
Sunni insurgency in Syria that is not only similar in character to the one
put down in Iraq, but has surviving Iraqi veterans of the war serving in it.
Some of us were very ignorant of politics of the region until recent years.
The trouble in Syria started because some children did some graffiti, and
the secret police tortured them, then there were peaceful demonstrations to
protest the torture, and the regime attacked the demonstrators.

@_subject: [drone-list] GAO Reports 
The GAO has a constant stream of reports, which got disrupted by the
government shut down.  Here are some recent releases whose titles sound like
they may have something to do with drones.
Defense Acquisitions: Navy Strategy for Unmanned Carrier-Based Aircraft
System Defers Key Oversight Mechanisms, GAO-13-833, September 26
I know that the US Navy has been testing various kinds of autonomous drones,
which can land and take off from Aircraft Carriers, without a human in the
loop.  I do not know how they avoid colliding with all the manned aircraft
doing the same thing.
GAO found that in fiscal year 2014, the Navy plans to commit to investing an
estimated $3.7 billion to develop, build, and field from 6 to 24 aircraft as
an initial increment of Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne Surveillance and
Strike (UCLASS) capability.  This is more than I knew before, and that is a
staggering sum of money, but it is not clear from GAO summary, if they
talking about autonomous or not.  Further, the GAO is not happy with the
state of oversight or accountability, has some advice for Congress and the
Secretary of Defense.  From the summary: This report (1) assesses the UCLASS acquisition strategy, (2) identifies key areas of risk facing the system, and (3) notes areas where the Navy's strategy contains good practices. To do this work, GAO reviewed the Navy's acquisition strategy and compared
it to DOD's acquisition policy, among other criteria; and reviewed Navy
acquisition documents and spoke with Navy and Office of the Secretary of
Defense officials.
I downloaded a copy of the full report, to review later.
Here is its link:  I named my copy: GAO Drones Military USN UCLASS 2013 Sept.
It is 1.2 Meg size, with 26 pages.
Defense Headquarters: DOD Needs to Reassess Options for Permanent Location
of U.S. Africa Command, GAO-13-646, September 9
I know that there are a lot of drone operations, many places, including
I glanced at the summary.  It does not sound like this report involves
Basically, AFRICOM HQ is in Germany because DoD asserts thats cheaper than
in the USA, but GAO is not convinced that exporting over 4,000 jobs is in
the USAs best interests.
Global Positioning System: A Comprehensive Assessment of Potential Options
and Related Costs is Needed, GAO-13-729, September 9
I know that many drones navigate by GPS which can be hacked.
If I am reading the summary correctly, ½ of current USAF budget is eaten by
outer space growth in GPS satellites from 24 to 30.  GAO says USAF cost
analysis is a good start, but more is needed.
National Airspace System: Improved Budgeting Could Help FAA Better Determine
Future Operations and Maintenance Priorities, GAO-13-693, August 22
I know that FAA has deadlines to approve dramatic increase of drones in NAS.
I suspect the sequester and other federal budget issues may have impacted
that work.
This is about ATC Nex Gen, which is a plan to replace ground based Air
Traffic Control with some GPS variant.  I can see many things which could go
wrong, off-topic here, more suitable for RISKS.
I have heard NOTHING about Nex Gen impact on drone operations.  I suspect
the portions of the gov focused on drones, and on Nex Gen, do not talk to
each other.
GAO is concerned about ATC overworked from current operations, before drones
added to the picture, and main reason ATC capacity problem is facilities
falling apart from old age to such a degree that it is unsafe to send humans
in to fix them.
If you are interested, I can forward off-list.  I also have links to scores
of other GAO reports recently released, on topics of:
*	Homeland Security
*	Military
*	Foreign Aid
*	Food safety
*	Federal finances
*	Economy
*	Education
*	IRS
*	Post Office
*	A list of private companies with GAO investigations  I dont
recognize any as drone manufacturers, but I dont have the complete list in
my head.
*	And other topics
In my prior downloading of GAO reports, I have learned that GAO reports are
works of the U.S. government, not subject to copyright protection in the
United States. They may be reproduced and distributed in their entirety
without further permission from GAO.[1] However, because these works may
