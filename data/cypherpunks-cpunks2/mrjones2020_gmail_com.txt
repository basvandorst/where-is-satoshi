Edd thompson essentially they're all suspect under some level of modest threat
(e.g. CUSTOMS interdiction or TAO enabling or ...)
so then you get to openRISC on an openFAB with strong chain of custody
along every step from sand to structure to send to self(and if you
lose proper custody of device that's your problem; see threat models
again :)
 for openHW?
oh, and of course the occasional FIB tear-down of fabricated cores to
confirm no surreptitious corruptions.  pick your favorite hard problem
best regards,

little spy guy isn't really protecting me from everyone spying?

It's viewed as "the banker's coin" and run by them.
It's everything cryptocurrency started out against.

You're absolutely right about the marketing.
We've seen an influx of "noobs" recently, and they tend to look for the
"next Bitcoin"... IE something cheap currently, which can shoot up 10x 100x
etc. Ripple will leave em bloody.
I can't stand the coin, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't use it for a
quick 5x recently.
No shortage of sheep in this market, and so few people aware that bots are
already doing their bot shit here, just like other markets.
