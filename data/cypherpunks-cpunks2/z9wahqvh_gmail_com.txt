CIA and NSA have often been thought not to be on the same page, largely
because NSA is military and CIA is civilian (or whatever special/uber
designation it has at this point). CIA sees itself as entitled to operate
much *more* lawlessly than NSA.
it is not hard to imagine scenarios where CIA might want to weaken NSA
capabilities in part via public embarrassment. and one involved in the plot
could even go public with his statements about how damaging the leaks are.

I find the work by the 9/11 Consensus Panel to be the best-documented, most
detailed, and most sober set of questions about the event that I've read.
they have quite a bit of good evidence collected regarding WTC 7, both the
official and plausible stories about what brought it down, and the
questions that they think remain. I agree with them. The explanations are
ad hoc, often stretching the limits of credulity, often at odds with
whatever physical evidence remains, and as in WTC 1 and 2, posit a
mechanism for building collapse that, whatever else you think about it, has
never been seen before or since, despite the fact that planes do crash into
buildings and fires do happen in buildings pretty frequently.
all their stuff is worth going through, but here's the WTC 7 material:

@_subject: latest false flag attack? 
for anyone interested, the page I pointed at previously contains links both
to the official explanations for the fall of WTC7, which include many
references to evidence, and public documents that clash with certain
aspects of that explanation:
the especially interesting question about WTC7, which has been obscured
here a bit, is not *that* it fell, but *how* it fell. (very quickly,
near-symmetrically, into its own footprint, and in free fall for at least a
brief period of time, which NIST first denied because of how unusual it
would be, and then admitted, as the page above documents.) Unlike WTC1 and
2, which had central structures of various sorts and were tall, thin
buildings, and in the official explanation had damage via burning debris of
various sorts down those central structures that is said to partly account
for a symmetrical collapse, WTC7 was shorter and wider, had no central
structures, and had not even allegations of symmetrical damage of any sort.
*some*--but not all--of the reasoning and facts provided by both James and
Peter is not the same as that provided by NIST in its reviews.
NIST and its engineers had to work very, very, very hard to find a way to
mesh the available evidence with any structural analysis that could explain
how--again, not *that*--it fell.
here is a link to what I believe is the most recent article, peer-reviewed
in a standard engineering journal (the house organ of the ASCE), by one of
the senior NIST engineers with a very detailed explanation of how WTC7
fell. I am not an engineer, but only someone who reads things in as much
detail as possible. I continue to be struck by the number of times models
need to be adjusted in order to get anything like the collapse in its
observed form to work out, the novel nature of the models, the amount of
uncertainty that remains--and then, as the 9/11 Consensus Panel questions
suggest, the amount of available evidence that has to be jettisoned or
downplayed (or, in the skeptics' opinion, misrepresented) in order to get
any model at all to work. This includes the official explanation of how
damage to the top and side of the building could cause it to collapse into
its own footprint, which is at the very least, not a behavior engineers
expected, no matter how long it burned.

"Since WTC 7 was not doused with thousands of gallons of jet fuel, large
areas of any floor were not ignited simultaneously. Instead, the fires in
WTC 7 were similar to those that have occurred in several tall buildings
where the* automatic sprinklers did not function or were not present*. *These
other buildings did not collapse*, while WTC 7 succumbed to its fires."
if you want me to accept the NIST report, you can't ask us to accept
facts/reasoning based on one person's reasoning, when the NIST report
