I am between two lands.
On one side I joined the Free Software movement mid90's, since then, all I have done require using/producing GPL software. I Fought Micro$oft evil empire of proprietary software and all I want is this model to die.
On the other side, this particular project is a seed for something bigger that requires funding. While looking my way through investors I must not disclose the sources because having a 'secret' in my pocket sort of helps in accessing funds.
Only when I am at good financial position that allows me continue with the project I'll make 1.- User base; 2.- dev community on GPL/AGPL os any other FOSS.
You see. It is not about a war between proprietary/free sw. It is how to getting mainstream.
My strategy is:
1st stage: privative - seed the project
2nd stage: Free - grow the fish
I apologize to me and to you free software advocates all of us for using a privative model as a continuity solution for the project.
I understand your complaints.

I do projects based on this platform for a living. In business there exist collaborations and devs from other companies are working with the source code under a standard NDA. This approach is ok in this context.
You can forget about taxation, I unfortunately used this word at the beginning and its meaning has nothing to do with current politics or govs.
I am really surprised that 'Automatic updates' is a thing for you. But if you have a better idea to have a distributed network in sync go ahead an explain. If you answer to this I hope you don't consider any manual step in the loop because only a small fraction would care or bother to pull updates.
Remember that we are talking about an embedded device, a dedicated piece of hardware running a system where the features are what you're missing to consider, blinded by considerations that you would only use when installing software in your workstation computer.
I don't think you have understood the sybil prevention based on IP4 for a blockhainn where consensus does not make distinctions based on CPU power, nor stake, but works for all node without discrimination.
The only reason you call it garbage is because you don't care to understand leave alone finding valuable comments.
I don't thing you've seen any other crypto running on inexpensive hardware with a true flat structure (no delegate nodes, no bias at all)

Thanks for changing route Zen,
As Punk-Stasi points out the Public System definition is vague at this point. what this USPS proposes is a bottom-up approach to a Public System, starting from the fundamentals.
The proposal is to replace current Governments with a low-cost distributed machine that would collect inputs and produce outputs in infinite loop. A system that would have a real view of the 'common interest' because it would not apply filters in people's input.
The system would be able to let people decide whether if a 'road' is convenient or not, and how to fund it.
Everything is better compared to our current model of participation in the society based on ticking a box every 4 or 5 years.

I have a ssh access to many of the existing nodes, as people who run them, (some I know, some I don't know who is behind), understands I need it for development purposes.
This is ok for alpha status and is also low risk while the value is low.
The whitepaper is in the kitchen, but is a slow cook.
Remember that this system is in late-development stage. It won't be officially released until the current alpha-11 evolve to 1.0
I bet they all have their operating system automatic updates turned on as they ought to do to keep their systems updated.
USPS this node will be trustable and secure on 1.0
because the dev-tools that are present during alpha will be gone, an the software will be released open-source.
This is a project aimed to maximize privacy, the whitepaper will tell the details.
Using encrypted communication is impossible (provably impossible) to determine the originating node of a transaction.
Using clear communication, is a not easy problem to deduce the originating address of a transaction.
A transaction contains input and output addresses, which are already anonymized.
So it offers pretty good privacy.
The most you can know is that a particular IP address operates a node, difficult to breach privacy.
Only "The Man" and your Internet Company could transform IP4 into your personna.
I am connected to politics in no way.
There is no security issue in transmitting a public key in clear, and there is a notable gain in performance. Tradeoff.
No, manual-pulling and auto-pulling differs little. The difference is the former requires human intervention.
An automatic system with a human loop is an error.
You can always turn in to manual for debugging or other purposes, but not as a stable node in the network, which needs to evolve without leaving nodes behind.
of course not, because until 1.0 the software is closed-source.
I am not going to enforce anything legal, nor particularly control or dedicate resources on that route. These are just legalities that prevent corps to misuse the tech.
NDA or written agreements state that nobody with access to the source code will publish it before I decide when. They work as a compromise of collaboration under non-disclose conditions.
Do I need to explain private trades are 100% legitimate?
I encourage overlay networks. In fact I run more than one.
It does care about the values I've put in this system: self-autonomy, privacy, P2P, no intermediaries, fair, flat societies.
The source code was AGPL, available and compiled by all nodes to generate their own binaries from 2017 to 2019. Then I closed sources on alpha-10 until 1.0
It is a preventive artificial restriction.
(Think Bitcoin 1Mb block max size limit). It prevents a form of attack in which many evil nodes are created biasing the consensus algorithm and overtaking the network.
It will exist before release of 1.0.
I said 80% of the people do not care about telling the world their IP address. (when I don't know real number I apply 80-20 rule as an asumption)
I didn't say that. You misinterpreted what I meant with 80%
1 node-1 vote. this is the democratic model.
There is no team, hus hus team or anything like this.
There are nodes, some of them are run by FFF and others are organic growth (friends of friends, or random people I meet in my journey)
It is not a Coin, A Coin is an element of a platform that can run multiple Coins.
UPSP doesn't fit the definition of Privacy Coin, as a
privacy Coin encrypt their transactions to protect public keys/addresses/signatures from being observed.
This is not strictly the case of USPS where the protocol can safely
operate in clear and transactuions are public. The relay model of USPS works exactly like bitcoin does.
Those would need to wail until 1.0 is released with all the documentation and source code.
Early birds now are those who accept the development status of the system and do not complain about the current restrictions. Instead, they would operate a node as user and test the conveniente of the features, the performance, and usability.
That was picky. Not incoherent from my side, I used GPL as a way to say GPL-ish. Free software in any case.
I accept there exist premine if is is understood that
at the moment of the public announcement of version 1.0
353114361543892 out of an int64 have been issued among the ~100 nodes that secured the network from alpha-rc1 to 1.0
This is 0.0038285%
See ref: search for "cash in circulation"
Call it premine. I don't care. I only care of securing a ledger and it takes skill, time and descomunal effort to listen to people complaining about premine, specially if we are talking about a ridiculous number.

Dear friends,
Request For Criticism about what I've written:
Current blockchains are all genesis-block based, which means they are ever-growing structures. Aside of being under the effects of an elastic-gum force that complicates their scalability in size, there exist problems scaling on addresses or scaling on bandwith. What touches to cryptography comes straight when dealing of ever-growing structures. Such a buried pile of layers of information requires consideration because it contains cryptography of past times. There are two problems with that. 1.- can expire secrets. 2.- The runtime software must be equiped with all cypher-suites used in the past, including those too old to rely on who were already cracked, broken.
A challenge is the to design a platform that does not depend on cypher-suites that were needed in the past. Once a new encryption technology deprecates another, the platform must be able to replace the cypher-suite and forget about the previous one.
Thanks, Regards : )

A minimal solution is to mechanize protocol versioning is to have only 2 version implementations of the protocol, same concept of double-buffer applied to algorithms instead of data.
Having only to maintain the 'current version' and the 'previous version'. This scheme only works in systems that are automatically updated because nodes that require human intervention will easily lose sync with the network.
I don't know the future of crypto all I bet is they will provide hasing, signing, verifying and encryption capabilities using public key infrastructure.
With this abstraction, and a systematic way of evolving the version of the protocol that can discard previously-used cyber-suites is what a platform needs from cryptography to enforce privacy.

@_subject: Theft 
It makes a lot of sense to me that tax equals theft.
However, my thoughts about tax goes on like when you buy a cup of coffee.
It is a self-choice to decide to commit to enter a shop and order one.
Once you committed the order on the counter you've entered into voluntary debt.
Now you'll run into problems if you decide to run away without pay.
Parallelism with public affairs are:
replacing "cup of coffee" with roads, education, health or whatever is considered public services.
Opting-in into Gov is like ordering the coffee, although Gov don't allow you to opt-out. Tax is theft since the moment they don't allow you to voluntarily opt in or out.
If you opt-in the Tax is no longer tax but paying as a consumer.
Problem is how do you opt-out without using public resources.
The libertarian approach is good. You use public resources and you voluntarily pay whatever you consider, including not paying at all..
2 extremes:
1.- Nobody pays
  Public services deprecate, vanish and nobody cares about. Soon people would start donating bits to increase the quality.
2. Everybody contributes to the pot
  Public services will adjust to the size of the pot.
  Individually you would 'vote' to make it better or worst by donating more or less to the pot.
  Reach an equilibrium which is self-adjusting continuously.
In my Public System project I called it Tax, but my 'Tax' must not be confused with the notion of theft. It is more like 1.-commit, 2.-pay.
Still finding out the right algorithm, all ideas are welcome.

Yes I potentially could, and I assume you think I am evil. but still the unique point for raising concerns is the network activity, since who cares what is going on in the raspberry pi apart from how much electricity is taking or how much heat is dissipating. Think what do you know about the software running in your router, likely proprietary software, same thing.
Regarding network activity all you'd see is around 15 connections to other nodes exchanging around 10kbps of encrypted packets.
Particulrly you are able to verify the node is niether scanning the LAN not attempting to connect to any local computer. You can even run it in different vlan to prevent it.
So, even when I am firmly an open-source advocate and the whole source code of the system will be released, this won't happen before I have enough user-base to justify the creation of a dev-community.
Updates are pulled by an script on the node that retrieves signed binaries from other nodes.
I do not need, as the one who is compiling the binaries, to have access to nodes. If I do during alpha development is only for development purposes and any possibility of anyone accessing your node including me is controlled exclusively by the node-owner.
Indeed, although I support nodes working for different forks,
I don't want to lose the mainnet (I call it channel 0)
In fact I have running two forks. There are nodes working in both channel 0 and channel 4348 which is a licensed private network, different blockchains.
I'd like to see a big number of forks with different ledger structures running different local economies. All nodes securing other blockchain also secure channel 0 blockchain, this is the main licence restriction, it is not about paying money for acquiring licences, to make a big public system.
I am not enforcing licences. Think microsoft, they dont pursue home piracy, they just make sure big corps are paying for their software.
This is anonymous system as far as underlying tech allows (IP4 transport).
Information travels encrypted end2end, aka node2node
My algorithm just enforces there are no more than 6 nodes per IP4.
Enough measure to safely grow to million nodes from the perspective of 51% attack.
Once reached millions, more nodes can be allowed per IP or even IP6 can gradually be enabled.
The system doesn't care whether there are many people running a single node, or there is one person running multiple nodes.
The global economy is run on the basis of nodes/addresses for the shake of anonymity. It can be assumed the network would stabilise on a node-human ratio distinct of 1:1. Which is fine. No need to enforce 1:1. Enforcing 1:1 would require disclosure of identities breaking anonymity.
Innocent people could be prevented from running a node given the IP4 restriction mentioned above.
But this would be happening only while the network grows in size.
Reached a point, preventive countermeaures could be relaxed allowing the participation of more people.
I am not tackling specially the problem beyond IP4 disclosure.
I first solve the system assuming IP4 disclosure is OK for 80% of the people.
If the demand goes big enough a separate work on how to hide IP4 addresses can be undertaken without invalidating any of the work done so far.
The program is:
genesis block, Node  - Nov-2018
FFF arounf the world invided to collaborate.
alpha-rc6, Node  - Apx Feb-2019
Told everyone to not spread the word, so I keep maneageable network size for dev.
alpha-11, around ~60 Nodes (Jan 2020)
...   (more nodes, I invite more people, YOU?)
For the shake of leveraging my effort I am not writing much literature yet. Will do as caring about the impl is less needed and can allocate more time to doc.
That's how I am going on : )

I know, nondefault ssh port is not a security measure, just info I give.
Important: SSH only applies to nodes I control because owners voluntarily allowed for development.
There is a reason for using IP4, see below.
Users have a linux box with root access protecting their wallet.
No one else but you enter the box.
Software updates are pulled like your OS pulls updates from repositories.
You can find a number of devices at your home fitting this model: Router, TV, Windows.
I know, this is a trustless project.
It is not an irrelevant parallelism. USPS box is debian Linux where you can login as root. Most routers that run proprietary software inside don't let you in as root, but you still run it.
USPS is more than a coin, it is a system that cares about your private data. not only financial data,
everithing fits, medical records, pics, ...
Security is maxed in this project.
The consensus algorithms do not exchange private data, TLS does little for security,
redundancy of information makes its potential utility unneccesary, man-in-the-middle modifying traffic does not impact in the consensus.
TLS comes important only in private P2P trades.
That's why BTC does not need encryption. Also USPS doesn't need it, although I run the public protocol encrypted mostly for verifying it works as well as unencrypted public traffic.
That's foolish reasoning because pulling and auto-pulling differs little.
You voluntarily allow or disallow your binaries are in sync with the rest of the network, one-time setting.
Only when the project gains user base an open source community will be started, with reproducible builds of course and ALL code open.
Not before, there is no point to opensource it before time.
Honestly, what are you going to do with 40K lines of C++ code? without user base you would not review a single file. Pointless at this stage to open source.
I do share the code with devs for specific patches under NDA.
Not sure what you mean, but might be performing bit of FUD with this project.
The point is that to perform Sybil carries a considerable cost. That's the fundamental law sustaining hashcash (BTC's PoW)
I don't know what you mean. How democracy enters into this?. There are IP4 endpoints, that's all.
And this is to allow a resiliency model based on number of nodes (as oposed to CPU power), which is much more aligned with democracy, as every node benefits from the profit generated by the system evenly.
It is not premine, everything 'mined' so far has done in the clear.
It is easy to verify how many 'satoshis' should be a in circulation since genesis.
And easy to verify the theoretical number matches the actual amount in circulation.
Proving that no alterations to cryptoeconomics has been done since then.
You ask me to shutdown mainnet to start another. Like if I ask to restart bitcoin because I joined later.
How this action would be taken by people who are running a node since long ago?
Still I advised to keep the size of the network small during alpha, where we are still.
Although discrete announcements was made on public forums like reddit,
see - So, from your perspective this could be a premine, from the perspective of current running nodes the network is going on.
Premine means reserving a share of tokens before launch. USPS didn't do this.
What USPS did was to grow slow in the open.
Anyway, Satoshi Nakamoto accumulated million bitcoins, you accuse me of pre-mining and if I did, Satoshi did.
None of us did. So your comment could be FUD again.
USPS is not a coin. You can create your own coin in it though.
I don't know what you nmean by privacy coin.
USPS is a systems that negotiates your private data efficiently using P2P protocols in your behald for the unique interest of defending your interest. (monetization, trading, visiting a Dr. ,.. anything)
Nothing to do with the fact that the platform already started in the past.
You can always join to be earlier than the rest, everyone is invited to join the earliers.
Obviously there are people who are already running nodes, they all deserve every penny they earnt since they joined.
Dont call it coin please. It is not a coin.
When user base is big enough a dev-community will be started. GPL
Running on mainnet
I could not do this announcements because there wasn't resources to do so.
I needed nodes development and people supported me, I cannot let them down restarting the blockchain.
This would be real FUD in an excercise of twisting the reality.
You can do basic macroeconomic math as explained above.
Anyway who cares about how much crypto has been generated so far, we're still in alpha, there's plenty of time and little amount has been pumped in comparison with the max. [int64 space]
Basically the number every node has earned are directly proportional to the time they've been in.

IPv4 provides unique features no other protocol has. address space is saturated (scarce) and addresses are not cheap. It is a a nice tool for Sybil control
That's a good one.
tl;dr; planned feature.
Monero, AFAIK, makes it difficult not impossible to trace transactions.
So it adds some obfuscation. If validation nodes are open source at some point in the code they have to do the basic math. Other thing is that this math is done not by all nodes but only some of the nodes. That's the difficulty for a listener node to catch all transactions.
In USPS, as long as the network is big, it makes harder -not impossible- to reconstruct the state from recorded transactions because nodes handle only a fraction of the traffic.
Still, addresses are anonymous, and nodes mix all of them as they arrive, making the equivalent of a big tx with many inputs-many outputs
on every consensus cycle.
Still yes, individual tx can be recorded as they arrive with a trivial patch. This would allow to follow the money across anonymous accounts. And this could lead to potential associations with separate events (e.g. I buy something and then I buy other thing; an observer could find a parallelism using time and sequence to narrow or find out  addresses belonging to me).
I have ideas to tackle these cases which are very real theoretically, although only for a minority of people would result of some real concern (to me is a concern))
To be added in the future, as the concern grows bigger, a mixer implemented as a public algorithm (my name for ~smart contract). With this feature one could use it anytime they can break the potential traceability of their money moves, which is already difficult if the network is big.
Privacy to me falls more on the ability to do real P2P end2end (real end2end) encrypted trades between 2 nodes without awareness of the rest.

If the malware is distributed in a bigger scale than the honest software, indeed, the evil network becomes the 'honest' one to the eyes of the software, that's 51% attack.
Provided a world distribution of people that can be evil/honest of 80%-20%, the likeliness of an evil network overtaking the honest one is lower than the opposite.
The evil network wont work if many evil nodes run behind same IP, so the malware must meet the same distribution enforcement applied to the honest net. Nodes running malware must be geographically distributed, so local marketplaces spreading malware have less chances to spread worldwide in order to compromise the network.

i though i gave a fair response.
i understand you say that many computers can be infected of malware by a single individual who is creating an attacking botnet.
An I said such botnet must be bigger than the network to succeed.
The security of USPS depends on the number of nodes, the bigger the best.
no technical reason, obviously it is flat internet.
But people operate in cultures, I mean that a malware disguised say for instance inside a pirate copy of photoshop will only be spread across those who use photoshop who are not caring about malware, not all possible computers.
Sorry about that if that's my fault. I try to respond with what I think about the attack vector you describe.
I am try to honestly persuade you guys to try USPS if you're really interested in it as a next-gen cryptocurrency system.

51% attack is always a concern. My answer is to have a big honest network that makes it very difficult for a botnet to coordinate the attack. the attacking vector is a war on size.
In bitcoin the homologous attacking vector is a war on hashing power.

My take on Monero is that it is an overengineered solution.
Mu understanding of an anonymous public system includes:
*I should be able to see in clear all the money in circulation, all the public database.
*I shouldn't be able to link anything to a particular person or group.
Monero fails the first one, bcs they focused on making it difficult to analyze the money flows, the cash in circulation, and macro-economy parameters that are of public interest. they instead made an opaque public system.
The privacy problem coming from having the flow in clear is obvious. Behavioural patterns can be used to identify the person behind.
The solutionm in my view, is not overloading the network, but instead by using a flow-break mechanism (like a mixer), which forms part of the public services offered by the platform.
The monero's trick is probably limiting its scalability as well.
but I am not an expert in monero's details. Just speak by intuition, somehow educated guess, as my knowledge comes from coding a comparable system.

it is fair comparison, but as opposed to LN, USPS does not use a different network. The same set of nodes that create the public system are building a separate mesh of P2P connections where they trade each other. The private system.
The private system would be the main source of public transactions, both systems can create a closed economic ecosystem.

IP4 allocated on known pools assigned to world-wide areas.
this wikipedia page illustrates a distribution.
The point is that the system can control the allocation of nodes by ip4 pool.
In fact , any node can connect to the system, by any transport like ip6 or tor, but only those participating in the voting process are sybil-controlled.
I would not call it premine, just mined, the network is running and mining.
Premine implies that the genesis started with allocations, which it is not true.
The way to verify it is by looking at the public ledger, taking the amount of coins in circulation and the originating time -oct-2018- and veryfy it matches 5e8 per minute.
Anyway this is just a number which is unbounded. it is huge intentionally, but small compared to the capacity. Time will adjust the number to real value.
Governance is meant to be distributed, not central authority, eligibility will be given only by skill, not economic power.

both terms apply. I think they went beyond with the concept of privacy, and entered in public terrain with privacy concepts.
In public arena privacy is not wanted.
public and private are opposite concepts.
Public: all data is transparent, not obfuscated, easy access, traceable.
Private: opaque, encrypted, authorized access, untraceable.
The public accounting shall be traceable if the money is public money , provided there is a protection where accounts cannot be traced to people.
you and your friend decide to create a pot. this pot is public for you both, but private for the rest.
The same pattern applies to a world-wide public system. If you have a share of ownership on any account you want this account to be traceable. So you can verify public money goes where it is supposed to go according to public rules.
fails in the sense they sacrificed public accounting, which motivated me to say it was overengineered, as they brough privacy concepts to an extreme.
Massive surveillance is an offence to privacy, right?
Hidding my account is an offence to me cause I cannot verify my stuff.
Hidding public accounts is an offence to a required transparency.
I want to sell my bananas, I need to find buyers.
I want to buy bananas, I need to find sellers
whatever helps me to achieve this trade that can be considered public, regardles which role I take (seller/buyer)
This anon guy HIJK is asking for a loan. I see HIJK was loaned before for X amount, and s/he repaid it. I can take the decision of taking the risk or not to contribute to this loan.
Provided I cannot trace HIJK with any person, HIJK could be interested is making his credit history public so he increases his chances to find lenders.
opposite of private.

The one that called my atention is the inclusion of CSW.
Any other flaws you spot?
Regarding monero I think I am not judging it fairly. It has a feature that USPS has not, which is to hide movements beyond the protection of Addresses being anonymous. Perhaps more, as I haven't looked at it in depth.
What I said were light thoughts about privacy, but I stand as well on the social need to share accounting for whatever is considered that needs to have public traceability, like public money, which I think it should work like a pot between 2, but instead of 2, all -voluntary- contributors. (I fear you if I mention the tabu word,.. tax.. sick! I said it) : )

I Agree, but the you don't need to avoid clear transactions, the adresses are anonymous.
hold on. you can study traffic and deduce this anan address corresponds to this guy, isn't it? ok. But you don't solve this vector like monero does, you solve it addressing the root of the problem, which is not the address in clear at all. traffic shall be masked or rndmly routed, fake packets (chaff traffic), etc. This job goes in a different place in the logic of the platform.
yes, that's tricky. Because chances of breaking anonymity go high when more information is available.
To counteract you can sybil yourself, using different addresses to break your patterns.
we'll get to that part, the anon overlay where chaff traffic is (supposed to be) working.
In this scenario:
*traffic analysis attacking vectors are addressed in the anon overlay
*transactions of the blockchain go in clear, revealing source address, amount, dest address.
You ca have an anonymous profile (I call it personality) that is publicly traceable (so trust can be vested on it) (for useful activitys like e.g. borrowing money)
Still you can use multiple personalities to break your physical patterns, e.g. you have a coffee at starbucks, then pay parking, then ask for a loan, then go buy fish.
If you use one personality that connects these 4 events an observer can narrow you.
But if you use different personalities the problem becomes harder.

Reseting a system breaks the promise. It is not easy action to do.
By doing this you are saying that the governance is weak, people who were trusting the system for long, running their hardware, would feel betrayed, and only because some potential new users don't like it to start after others.
Imagine if I say now that -because Bitcoin wan't announced on TV worldwide- the network has to be reseted so I join. Sounds crazy of course, but this shares the same aspects when dealing with a claim for reseting a blockchain.
Anyway the USPS was publicly posted soon after the genesis block, inviting people to try the system.
I think there are previous posts in reddit.
I can say again that the crypto earned by nodes since the network started has no exchange value as per today, nor the coins have a ceiling (like e.g., 21M). So they just count as a measure of the time they have been working for the network, and this is the fair status.

isn't it in the list?
Let's assume the netowrk runs with chaff traffic.
knowing your IP4 doesn't mean knowing your tx activity.
What is this sentence about?
now you listen, any hard problem can be decomposed so each part is simpler.
What's the problem mate? you think I can write a paper on each answer?
I wont. it looks like I am begging for feedback. I am not.
I use the term anonymous when in the context I use it it doesn't exist a way to discover the identity, or it is not supposed to exist unless a glitch, or if the potential breach comes from traffic analysis where chaff overlay is responsible to address.
Pseudo-anonymous, when there exist a complex but possible way to breach anonymity.
Sometimes I use anonymous meaning pseudoanonymous, but only when the context is not focusing on anonymity.
Now you can explain why did you say it.
accounts and IP addresses are necer linked
all accounts
I think we might at the same level of accuracy in the terminology, aren't we? Unless you want me to use 3 adjectives each time I have to refer to something
Coming with your complain on my accuracy I see how unclear is your statement, because you could be more precise and state the biggest concern the topic suggests to you, instead of saying I dont understand anything)
hunting for "better than BTCes" riches, that right there is an instant and easy elimination of USPS from their consideration set.
IP address doesnt connect with your addresses, even if you do traffic analysis (bcs of chaff traffic).
By the time they are prepared and incentivized to run 10K nodes the network would be 10M. Those big-but-slow players are not a concern to me. They will be offseted by honest players.
I can see that you cannot find any circumstance for this sentence to be correct.
Let's assume I know your Ip address.
And assume I know who you are bcs I am your neighbour, the hacker.
I learn you are having traffic using some TCP ports and exchange some encrypted messages with others.
I disconver easily you are running an USPS node.
I run one as well, and eventually I make my node connect with yours as a neigbout.
The I see in clear our p2p communication.
Particularly I capture a tx coming from you stating a disclosed amount is transfered from account A to B.
the system uses chaff traffic, so in the unlikely but possible case I work for your ISP or the Cybercrime dept I could do traffic analysis, examining your IO activity.
Now Zen you can continue to explain how do I do in this assumption to learn more about your financials because I am short of ideas at this point.
I have not any secret sauce, I have just a codebase, which is kept not public until all conditions are met.
Some self-help (I want to call it that way) adding nodes will help opening the sources and with it the possibility of network forks.
The bigger the network is the more comfortable I'll find myself to open the code.

Yes, indeed Karl, it is only about when I am ready to unleash it, I am getting good investment leads for USPS, as soon as one of them materializes in the right terms (one of the terms is that the codebase they invest in MUST be GPL, and other is that the Governance of the system must be anonymous, skilled with proof and distributed)
Until that happens I must stick with the terms of my current investor, which requires not to opensource it yet.
In my idea the node would not only be a nmere storage, but instead it would behave as a negociator of your private data, so that one would be able to control the distribution, monetization, or whatever trade you'd like to do with it, including obviously not doing any trade at all with depending which data.
The same system can serve as the anonymization overlay we talked about in another thread. All the aspects of a sybil controlled mesh arrangement of nodes are already working fine. With the inclusion of chaff traffic, which fits seamlessly in the design, and introducing a technque to hide originators and receptors (e.g. onion routing) it would be sorted out.
In general, any features related to personal privacy, the empowering of the individual, and this line of philosophy are welcome in the USPS codebase, like this black box project.
I look fwd to all these things happen.

I've never been evasive, why would I have transmitted that?
And one can never be deep enough in regular talk.
It is psychology I guess, you shoot me a deep question and I correspond with a deep answer. Similarly for a superficial question I guess.
There are more possible interpretations.
My main motivation is to make the greener, more efficient, fairer or less-biased and the most distributed crypto platform in the market, that can be used mainstream for managing the world wide society in a flat way, progressively approaching to a substitution of old governments based on hierarchical accumulation of power.
I explained taxation. Which I understand as voluntary pay for service.
Then I see that's a blocker idea and a mistake I made speaking first about it, because has been completely misunderstood.
This project is not meant to be used as a tool for govs. It is a mean to substitute govs.
my job I guess. So I suggest to forget about taxation because it is taken in the wrong direction. It was my fault to have started describing a 'paying pattern' with the same word just because the money would be used to fund shared interests.

This is wrong assumption about UPSP. The fact that you know the IP of the nodes does not reveal anything else about the node behind, not who is the source of information on any transaction, not the recipient, not the message.
The only think that reveal that there is a node behind exchanging encrypted traffic with other nodes.

First I have too state that I have not implemented anything related to the anonymization layer that is under the responsibility to the Tor project (or others) or the potential new one I could implement in the future to complete the project (The anonymization layer).
Today's implementation of USPS is the cryptoplatform providing pseudoanonymity.
The layer of anonymity that can be implemented with the same nodes that run the cryptocurrency can be used as anonymization layer. In this network the traffic as is today could be wrapped into a pattern of traffic that hides the real pattern.
All these concerns belong to the onion layer and will be tackled at the right time in the USPS project.
I am not afraid of IP4, the resource is already scarce and their cost provides a good measure against attackers that are not The Man.
I am not scares about Govs too, since they haven't moved a finger yet against bitcoin, even though they can. By the time USPS reach the volume of Bitcoin it would have much many more nodes spreaded across all the IPv4 pools, which means that the algorithm can be improved to pick only votes from a unbiased distribution of IP4 across pools. If a powerful Gov decides to use a big pool of IP4 to attack the network, and the IP4 pools are spread across the worls, the voters will be evenly distributed across the world, it will be very hard for a single Gov to shut it down. It would have to collude with other Big govs, increasing the difficulty for them. They would need to collude up to the point to make 51% of the surface of the Earth to agree on that.
That's not gonna happen.
The public protocol do not need to be encrypted neither in Bitcoin not  in USPS. USPS is running encrypted today though. The fact that Tx or consensus protocol goes in clear doesn't affect the pseudaanonymity nor the privacy.

This project is about solving the system:
  A) without PoW, which consumes too much energy and induce to centralization (network shrink) and territorial segregation forces
  B) without PoS, or any other Po* I've considered during my design (e.g. biased cryptoeconomy, e.g. PoS allows mining to those who have more wealth)
I encourage you to find another available scarce resource that meets the criteria of being unbiased and I'll consider it to be used instead of taking advantage of the scarcity of IPv4 addresses.
Additionally, all criticism towards USPS related to anonymity goes to a proper overlay layer compatible with such rule.
Tor is not valid because is unable to apply the limiting rule.
I'll either propose a patch to Tor or develop an anonymity layer in the future, near or far, depending on the priorities of every stage of the project.
Hope it serves.

I like the bubble style because i think it is more efficient many times. A head, a codebase.

It is great to exchange help, work, pieces of code, etc in a "I work for your project and you work for my project" or something alike

A really major current effort is gnunet  which modularizes p2p networking functions for reuse, as local services that provide them I believe.  It's very powerful but very few projects are using it; setup and a verbose learning curve might be an entry barrier, unsure.

I am preparing a draft of a draft for a spec of what I think would be the ideal complimentary anonymization overlay that fits on the already running distributed system I am working on, which is USPS and is very good.
It would be great if many ideas arise in this list so we can start focusing a conversation. My personal interes is to achieve a system that can provide Sybil protection for voting systems. Which is the reason Tor cannot be used with USPS, since one could create millions of colluding evil nodes and ditch the system. I limit it using IPv4 because it is very easy to enforce an homogeneously distributed network controlling the maximum number of nodes/votes   per IP. This limit will grow as the IPs are filled with voting power.
I already have the Sysbil protection implemented and the network of nodes running exchanging encrypted traffic about consensus. The only thing I have left are two things:
onion routing (or a faster alternative that doesn't exist but I am researching), chaff traffic.
...and probably more considerations. I am not expert in anon overlays, but perhaps we can brainstorm so I can become one : )

The solution for this problem doesn't fall into the blockchain platform. The platform will delete the information if evidence signed by the right private key is presented.
If you want to protect a piece of information from "rubberhosing" you must follow a procedure to safeguard it. for instance :
1. break down your key into several parts, using the Shamir secret sharing squeme.
2 spread the parts acros a distributed group of people you trust
3 delete the key so nobody can force you to reveal
4 the attacker must have to coherce a number of people to reconstruct the private key

The 'registry' function is an important feature. To me, the most important feature is the ability to create a perceived macroeconomy based on all detailed microeconomies produced by millions of personal coins, which was a design feature of USPS.
In USPS there is not a concept of 'block'. I changed the wording in the USPS context to avoid confusion. Instead there exist the homologous concept 'diff', representing the difference between the previous state and the next.
A diif is used to be appplied to a base state producing the next state. The both the previous state and the diff can be forgotten or deleted because they are never needed again.
That's way USPS is 'lean', lightweight, not bloated with past information, and that's why USPS is not immutable (as a positive trait) and for so it is very easy to upgrade the cypher suite without compromising past encrypted data.
Immutability is a threat to privacy.

That's USPS mechanism:

The unbloated trait is present as well. There is no history to carry on with it acting like an elastic gum (time to sync a new node for instance).
The verification taking place to calculate the next state
is enough to trust on the state. There is no need to
validate the history from the genesis to trust the last state.
The truth starts there, on the last block.

Sybil attack is prevented with an invention based on IPv4 protocol. Allowing the homogeneous spread of the network across the surface.
IPv4 are publicly discosed, but (with the collaboration of chaff traffic included in the development roadmap) this is not a concern to privacy assunming a huge number of nodes, because all you can see is whether or not a node is running behind a paricular IP.
For the moment, while I am coding, I discipline myself to not focus on formal documentation. All my interest is to get people involved after informal conversations. That would progressively change while approaching a release date, when All possible docs should be ready to be read.
I am involved in the crypto-movement as developer of BCH, until I went for my own ideas by the beginning of 2017.
I have for many years or decades a thread running underneath about replacing governemnts by low cost machines changing the way society organizes, making everyone involved (I mean 3rd world) and rising their and our lifestyle. Which I think is very possible.
when I realized the Satoshi paper I was immediately trapped and commited to align this tech with my ever goal. So I changed my work from Aeronautics to Crypto-Finance, where I got inmersed in bitcoin-core, then I went along the BCH fork because I was in agreement with rising the block size.
Imagine you operate USPS. You can create a Coin (MatBitCoin) becoming the mint. You control everything about it included creation and destruction of volume. That coin could well represent your own value as a worker, so you could start using it in the same way central banks control the mint optimizing their economy.
Same extended to millions would create a rich soup of value-exchanges.
Systems able to remove 3rd parties are threatening politics as well.
Since politicians are simply your intermediaries towards public budgets decision making.
This system models a flat society where every participant is using a node to fast interact P2P with other individuals, groups or companies
The world society seen as 10Billion people, 10B different mindsets, that many 'centralized systems' (a node is a centralized system itself, with the only function to execute the owner's intent and will, without any discrimination).
So the target is 10-100 Billion nodes. Then we can see on one side a  human side composed of all humans, they cannot be traced to the node they run unless they leak it), and on the other side the interaction (half public/half private) among the participants.
whatever we need to live without the need to have a central ruling gov that steals our power and a good fraction of the money they say we earn.
This is my alpha deployment that doubles as testbench. It is the seed of the network.
If intead of 49 they are 10 billion, you can consider the risk of being a target negligible.
I mean if all IP addresses are public and all have a node there is no compromise at all. Obviously the network, when little, can be seen as a target. This is the risk of any birth.
To complicate a physical adversary these IP's are anywhere in the world.
I trust the GNU/Linux Operating System will do a good job here.

Not self-promotion, that's not the reason.
Just needed to let out what I think about this.
Those who don't find it arguable in terms of general social behavior can ignore this thread.

No mate, you get it wrong.
1.- I am making a living with this project.
2.- Whoever is paying me he does it to get it conducted to businesses, which is fine to me, is not happy with free software, and I respect it.
3.- In the business, privative world, it is normal to exchange NDA's. That's a given.
4.- As soon as I get funding to create the "open-source" branch I will, as a free software enthusiast, start the community. But not before, do I don't upset the man who is making it possible to develop the system. Who is aware since the beginning of the intention, but kindly asked me to wait to release the sources until the product is more mature, giving him time to sell it as a privative platform based on licences.
That's contextual to help understand.
So to me is fine both worlds and they will co-exist.
Now, if you don't like, I would kindly ask you to just manifest that you don't like it. But don't cross the line of being a gentleman because it does not help neither me nor to you.
I suggest you to change your prejudices you invented about my product, and start either just ignoring with respect or looking at it as an opportunity to learn about new approaches to cryptocurrencies.
The network is there, the invitation to participate and the opportunity to join a genesis of a new system that could potentially make it is there.
If you have any reservation regarding working for money I just ask you to respect other perspectives of life instead of distorting the facts. I'd also ask you to think twice about it because what do we all do for a living? mostly working on making money. right?
Just leave it with me. I am not a privative software person. the system will be published GPL, of course.
Thanks for getting back to your concerns about my tech or about my coherency. Perhaps this one could make you change your mind...
Let me know

like, e.g. Qt, MySQL or RedHat GNU/Linux. I promote the free software side of it. And also the Business side of it, because I am entrepreneur.
For those who like to play a different game in the private sector, a product fit to them will be supplied.
If you only tolerate Free software is fine, your choice. For me being open to what exist is essential for survival and rise.
Yes, I agree with this. This doesn't mean we cannot cooperate in a flawed world. In bz you have to sign NDA with cooperating parties, knowing that is a weak contract that mostly serve as a memorandum of intentions. I am against patents and all this shit as well.
I refered to NDA that for the first time here in the context of what is the procedure to share the sources of non-free software or, in my case, software that is not yet released. That's something that can be questionable philosophically, but it does exist. I have signed a lot of them of them and they're like most like a ritual to move on to practical things between 2 parties in private agreement..
Yes because literally this is anonymous system where anyone is alloed to participate without asking for permission, by design (aside from implementation complications like Tor defects).
This cannot be a reason to criticize the tech.
 ok
I have zero intention to hide anything.
I cannot focus on particular topics with wide questions, so,.. in general what is it? a decentraliced P2P system that can run using inexpensive hardware where nodes form a flat organization (no different roles), the connect each other as a mesh forming a graph of connections where the number of edges is configurable on every node. Permissionless, anonymous, the algorithm only cares about the current state of the database and is not linked backwards to previous states. The system is Sybil protected using IPv4 addreses and depends on the internet be turned on (formerly Arpanet). The algorithm enforces homogeneous distribution of nodes over the IPv4 geographical allocations and its security increases with the number of nodesm with no known shrinking forces (like other competitive consensus algorithms). The consensus is based on BFT. It preserves no history and a 51% attack is possible during the time the network is small. That's the public system, a multi-coin account where the definition of a coin is not a chain of signatures but a utxo set, where an utxo is a Bitcoin word, I call it boxes because files or typed information can be also stored in every account. Nodes also run a wallet with P2P protocols to trade among them in what I call the pricate system. Both system (the public, the private) form a closed ecosystem designed to maximize transactions, thus a system that can be used to run an aggregation of microeconomies, eventually the world-wide economy.
That's an overview and a final note on the vision.
If you are interested in having a feel of new systems like this you're invited, anyone, is permissionless, so I dont even have to know. Accept my disclaimer as the creator this is what the system needs to mature until the public release.
There is no evil software running in it. Accept for now the same disclaimer you accept from  the mailing system you use. Excerpt:
"How can I trust you?
You can't. Cock.li doesn't parse your E-mail to provide you with targeted ads, nor does cock.li read E-mail contents unless it's for a legal court order. However, it is 100% possible for me to read E-mail, and IMAP/SMTP doesn't provide user-side/client-side encryption, so you're just going to have to take my word for it."
 Best,

Nah, one thing is criticism and other is a guy calling you repeatedly a scammer when you are showing up your work. That is not precisely good taste.
the source code is GPL, but I haven't published it yet, that's all.
Is in the roadmap. For reasons it will be released before 1.0

I have stated everything I can state about when the sources will be published.
You can freely consider them not-free till then.
But the exact thing is that they have a Free Licence but they are not publicly available yet.
I am free software people as well. I've introduced free software in big corps and always have fought against privative software.
I am tech entrepreneur, I like to combine free sw and business.
I see. So far this is a major problem here for checking out the system at user level.
Like if they dont trust me lol, I can understand though.
I try to build trust based on conversations anyway.
I have not a problem giving away my work, I think it is positive, I've always thought it.
it will hapen when I feel ready to do so. Like preparing it for public review, with developer documentation, and with funding, the most important thing.
A dev community requires a loit of dedication and I have to secure the funds before the ball starts to grow out of my hands.
I follow a plan you see. Other thing is is whether or not I can be trusted without publishing everything like in an inconvenient rush for me.

It rather works this way: you run in your comuter the software you like to run, which would be 99% written by others.
The private system I refer tu has nothing to do with the private sector ( a bunch of colluding orgs afine to gov)
The private system is instead based on private P2P secret trades.
ok. I'll be more descriptive on this one.
1.- Nodes broadcast evidences (a generalized term I used to represent transactions).
2.- All nodes are aware of all evidences
3.- verified evidences are applied in real time onto a temporary view of the 'new' state made of the current state plus a the diff they are building.
4.- At agreed timings they sign and broadcast their diff
5.- All nodes decide, based on the views of the rest, which is the legitimate diff and broadcast the hash of their delta.
6- All nodes receive the hash of the legitimate delta from the rest, and decide which delta is the legitimate based on a majority of 'votes'
6.- if the winner delta matches the one they computed they just apply the delta to the current state to produce the next state. If not they request and receive the delta from neighbours.
7- goto 3
Let me know if it is understandble.
a word coined during bitcoin development. unspent transaction output (UTXO). The UTXO set is a concept equivalent to an accounting ledger.
Bitcoin defines a coin as a chain of signatures, which I found it a very inneficient design. An utxo is the last link of such chain.
In contrast USPS only holds the accounts, a coin is not a chain of sigs, is an entry in a database.
Think of a vault, or a typical security box used in banks to store customer's valuable items.
An account is like a transparent security box  where you can store anything: files, data structures, and where public algorithms store their data, e.g. the coin accounting.
As part of the protocol there is a lightwight implementation (fit for the purpose) of a distributed file system (DFS) -ref. e.g. IPFS-.
Every node can configure the size of disk space to be used as file storage.
Those expressions are more like bird-eye views.
It means getting rid of criminal orgs to replace them with trustable machines that can serve us to run a public system -
US - PUBLIC SYSTEM
I dont have any political bias, ZERO.
I am no-wing.
I don't care about classic politics or ideologies.
I do care about personal ideas and the right to not be represented by anyone. Politicians are 3rd party actors. Unnecessary in a P2P understanding.
3rd world means people with talent who cannot afford to have a comfortable home with broadband connection.
poverty can be eradicated.
I hope this helps a bit more in the understanding of USPS.
Thanks for asking. : )

at the end of the day any development of any product is nothing but a promise.
Some trust must be in place during such a time.
The remaining choices are ignore and/or wait till the product is well mature and adopted (a.k.a missing the early-bird bus)

yes, I am glad you got the sequence.
It will hit a limit, but then it will enter another mechanism, sort of a composition of networks, I'll not provide much detail of this one because it is not implemented nor tested yet.
But the idea spins around having each network of (say 10000 nodes) taking care of a fraction of the address space.
yer, per cycle. not one, well, there exist a 'root' crypto called gas.
the range is the whole 64 space (No 21M cap).
gas is used to take transaction fees and to control the bloating of the address space charging a fee on each account every cycle. (maintenance).
The problem to address is the creation of infinite accounts at 0 cost for the troll.
Accounts are consuming gas and if they run out of it they are destroyed.
Remember this system is not meant to be immutable because I consider immutability a compromise on privacy.
If, after extermination, the need they used to cover (registry, law, economy,..) is left in the wild they would rebirth again and again.
So replacement is more appropriate to me. but ok.
I dont believe in delegating my political capabilities, whatever they are, to a 3rd party, if that makes more sense.
How about you?

I feel like I am getting some degree of trustability. thanks for the illusion. : )
(After writing note: I started to write a short mention, but then I think I've extended myself for long. Serve it to publish the intention in search of potential flaws.)
I like to have a single point of failure. (even though I've worked for doing safety critical systems in aeronautics where there must a chain of failures to finally cause the disaster).
The difference that in aeronatics the system is composed of trusted subsystems, which are all redundant.
In an untrusted system you can only rely on your node and on the ledger.
The single point of failure is transaction validation. If you break this, then all subsystems are compromised and the whole system collapses, all trust lost.
Once a tx is validated its payload enters the ledger modifying it.
The software running in the node comes from the ledger itself.
In USPS the software is published by what I call the Other Foundation. An anonymous organization that publishes files in the account 4NwEEwnQbnwB7p8yCBNkx9uj71ru.
if you execute in your node this command:
gov data 4NwEEwnQbnwB7p8yCBNkx9uj71ru
you would get this:
Account 4NwEEwnQbnwB7p8yCBNkx9uj71ru
locking_program 11111111111111112UzHM
GAS volume 107237822
5 files. Total size 40 MiB.
  nN85MYnExi1jNvSdUy8ZMq2WRVy PuxQ2g 8274508 bytes
  3GVc1XJ1ifeqNkGZLnhnuKCL1LvH ZouMi2A 8524527 bytes

  4DtfKBoVzbQ9Ha4FdTHk8XtETHsB v8uq1f 8515720 bytes
Nodes are fed from those files, they can obtain them from anywhere, the only thing they have to do is to check the content of the file hashes to one of those files (e.g. nN85MYnExi1jNvSdUy8ZMq2WRVy), and the binaries included in it can be trusted if the account 4NwEEwnQbnwB7p8yCBNkx9uj71ru is trusted.
Now, in order to trust this account one must trust the other foundation, the org behind this account.
The future of the governance shall be distributed, so publishing content in this account must be done via the collaboration of a pretty large group of people that are skilled to have this responsibility.
This chapter of community governance deserves to be treated perhaps in a separate thread.
mutable after the possibility of deleting accounts (always after evidence of intention from the owner, or lack of maintenance (gas goes 0))
once deleted there's not a possibility to retrieve the content from the trusted state anymore. (perhaps from other sources that could have copied the deleted data while it was publicly available)
?? current govs?, or future social orders that we can blueprint.
Two different stories.
Economy is a social need since we have the need of exchanging value.
yup, although I don't like words that can carry connotations I don't identify with like e.g. lack of social order.
