I don't consider it to be spam.  It's relevant to the list and the history of cypherpunks.  What was done to Jim was so egregiously wrong, I think he has the right to correct the facts whenever possible.  Greenberg has a responsibility to address these concerns.
We have new list members all the time who may not know the backstory, and it's important.  We're adults, we can just skip over list-relevant posts we don't want to read.
 It sounds very important to you and spam to the rest of us.
Then don't read the message, Al.  The reality is that Greenberg wrote a very prominent book, which effectively libeled me on the subject of events which are related to Cypherpunks.  I think that the readers of this list will want to know that, about Mr. Greenberg, and in the future they will want to see what he does about it.

To Get Around US Law, The NSA Collects Email Address Books And Chat Buddy Lists From Foreign Locations
by	 ALEX WILHELM posted 2 Hours Ago
The Washington Post [link below] broke news this afternoon that the National Security Agency (NSA) is collecting huge numbers of email address books and chat buddy lists for both foreign individuals and United States citizens.
It appears that the NSA lacks Congressional authority to collect buddy lists and address book information in the way that it currently does. As the Post rightly points out, address book data can include physical addresses, very personal information, and more.
To get around that lack of a mandate, the NSA has agreements with non-U.S. telcos and works with other, non-U.S. intelligence groups. So to get its hands on even more information, the NSA avoids the constraints of its provided oversight and legal boundaries, by going to alternative sources of the data that it wants.
That matters because the rules of other countries for tracking the communication of United States citizens are more lax. Recall that the NSA is in some ways slowed from collecting information on citizens of the United States, but not those of other countries.
So, if the NSA is willing to accept data from foreign intelligence agencies that it is not able to collect in this case, why not in other cases as well?
If the NSA won’t respect the constraints that are put in place on its actions for a reason, and will instead shirk its responsibilities and find a way to get all the data it could ever desire, then we have even less reason to trust its constant petitions that it follows the law, and is the only thing keeping the United States safe from conflagration.
The Post continues: “When information passes through ‘the overseas collection apparatus,’ [an intelligence office] added, ‘the assumption is you’re not a U.S. person.’” This means that when the NSA sweeps up contact data, buddy lists, and address sets from overseas, the same rules that keep it from collecting information on United States citizens aren’t likely in play. Minimization, it would seem, would be minimal.
The phone metadata program knows who you called, when, and for how long. PRISM can force your private information out of major Internet companies. XKeyscore can read your email, and tracks most of what you do online. And the above program circumvents Congressional oversight by collecting more data on U.S. citizens by merely executing that collection abroad.
How private are you feeling?
Facebook provided TechCrunch with the following statement:
“As we have said many times, we believe that while governments have an important responsibility to keep people safe, it is possible to do so while also being transparent. We strongly encourage all governments to provide greater transparency about their efforts aimed at keeping the public safe, and we will continue to be aggressive advocates for greater disclosure.”
Microsoft repeated to TechCrunch what it had told the Washington Post, that it “does not provide any government with direct or unfettered access to our customers’ data” and that if the above revelations are true, then the company would “have significant concerns.”

  Cheney had heart device partially disabled to prevent a terrorist from
sending a fatal shock
Olivia Harris, Pool, File/Associated Press -  In an interview with CBS’ ”60
Minutes,” former Vice President Dick Cheney says he once feared that
terrorists could use the electrical device that had been implanted near his
heart to kill him and had his doctor disable its wireless function.
By Associated Press, Saturday, October 19, 1:34 AM
WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Dick Cheney says he once feared that
terrorists could use the electrical device that had been implanted near his
heart to kill him and had his doctor disable its wireless function.
Cheney has a history of heart trouble, suffering the first of five heart
attacks at age 37. He underwent a heart transplant last year at age 71.
In an interview with CBS’ ”60 Minutes,” Cheney says doctors replaced an
implanted defibrillator near his heart in 2007. The device can detect
irregular heartbeats and control them with electrical jolts.
Cheney says that he and his doctor, cardiologist Jonathan Reiner, turned off
the device’s wireless function in case a terrorist tried to send his heart a
fatal shock.
Years later, Cheney watched an episode of the Showtime series “Homeland” in
which such a scenario was part of the plot.
“I found it credible,” Cheney tells “60 Minutes” in a segment to be aired
Sunday. “I know from the experience we had, and the necessity for adjusting
my own device, that it was an accurate portrayal of what was possible.”
Cheney and Reiner are promoting a book they co-authored, “Heart: An American
Medical Odyssey.”
In the “60 Minutes” interview, Reiner says he worried that Cheney couldn’t
stand the pressure that came on Sept. 11, 2001, the day terrorists attacked
the U.S. Medical tests seen that morning showed Cheney had elevated levels of
potassium in his blood, a condition called hyperkalemia, which could lead to
abnormal heart rhythms and cardiac arrest.
Reiner says he watched news coverage of the day’s events on television and
thought, “Oh, great, the vice president is going to die tonight from

Cheney is one of the biggest ter'rists and war criminals around.  He should be rotting in a prison beneath the Hague, with the rest of his ilk.
I'd love to know how a 70-year-old man with his cardiac history was approved over anyone else on the transplant list.  Seems like an egregious violation of the rules, but hey- that's how those fuckers roll.
 A terrorist is a person who spreads fear. I'd feel safer in a world without Cheney; that's murder, not terrorism! :)

Cheney is one of the biggest ter'rists and war criminals around.  He should be rotting in a prison beneath the Hague, with the rest of his ilk.
I'd love to know how a 70-year-old man with his cardiac history was approved over anyone else on the transplant list.  Seems like an egregious violation of the rules, but hey- that's how those fuckers roll.
 A terrorist is a person who spreads fear. I'd feel safer in a world without Cheney; that's murder, not terrorism! :)
 Cheney had heart device partially disabled to prevent a terrorist from
sending a fatal shock
Olivia Harris, Pool, File/Associated Press -  In an interview with CBS’ ”60
Minutes,” former Vice President Dick Cheney says he once feared that
terrorists could use the electrical device that had been implanted near his
heart to kill him and had his doctor disable its wireless function.
By Associated Press, Saturday, October 19, 1:34 AM
WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Dick Chene!
 y says
he once feared that
terrorists could use the electrical device that had been implanted near his
heart to kill him and had his doctor disable its wireless function.
Cheney has a history of heart trouble, suffering the first of five heart
attacks at age 37. He underwent a heart transplant last year at age 71.
In an interview with CBS’ ”60 Minutes,” Cheney says doctors replaced an
implanted defibrillator near his heart in 2007. The device can detect
irregular heartbeats and control them with electrical jolts.
Cheney says that he and his doctor, cardiologist Jonathan Reiner, turned off
the device’s wireless function in case a terrorist tried to send his heart a
fatal shock.
Years later, Cheney watched an episode of the Showtime series “Homeland” in
which such a scenario was part of the plot.

Good point.  This guy's attempt was humorous  , but I'd x-post this to libtech because there are several lawyers and EFF staff on that list who might be able to advise on whether there are any suits already pending, and if it's feasible.
That's complete bullshit.  We know damn well Yahoo (et al) has backups of backups.  I'd try to fight with them a bit before letting the account go.
 I just received a seeming 'boilerplate' (pre-canned) email from Yahoo email, saying that my previous account  (jamesdbell8  will be deleted.  It does not repeat the previous claim of "abuse" on the account, but the timing of the events strongly suggests that the source of the problem was an attack on probably millions of Yahoo email addresses that has occurred over the last week or so.  Naturally, I am completely outraged that they allowed such an event to result in actual loss of 'all' data in the account.  Could it be that Yahoo's system was truly damaged so seriously as to cause the complete loss of my email and address-list database?
    However, I am reminded of the old saying, "If you get lemons, make lemonade".   Because of Edward Snowden's
 revelations, we have known that the NSA has been storing all domestic, and probably as many foreign, emails as they could get their grubby little hands on.   Why not a class-action lawsuit demanding that Yahoo obtain prior emails from the NSA?     While it is difficult to sue the US (primarily due to something called "Sovereign Immunity"),  I am aware that the Federal government has already waived Sovereign immunity for everything except money damages.  (In other words, you can sue them for 'declaratory' and 'injunctive' relief:  A court could order the NSA to deliver the data back to Yahoo.)        Does anyone out in the Wide World of Cypherpunks know of an attorney wanting to take on this kind of issue?  It
 could put the NSA in a world of hurt for taking the data, and make them realize that one consequence of taking hold of such a massive amount of data is that they will ultimately be sued if it is necessary to recover.  It would also put email providers such as Yahoo on notice that they have additional obligations (other than those they think they have) to recover lost emails.       Jim Bell

   "Just when we thought we were out, they drag us back in ..."
Recently reviewed documents leaked by Edward Snowden reveal that,
following the discovery of large quantities of pornography on hard
drives retrieved from the Abbottabad compound where Osama bin Laden
was assassinated, the NSA became concerned that al Queda was using
steganographic techniques to hide various communications within the
jpgs and animated gifs, and began a program (known internally as
'Project Creampie') to collect all the pornography on the internet
into one giant database, presently located at the new NSA data
storage center in Bluffdale, Utah, that could be searched by
various interns and subcontractors. Progress has apparently been
slowed due to subcontractor Hewitt Packard's problems in designing
and building a computer keyboard impervious to "precious bodily
fluids". In response to the newly discovered NSA obsession with feelthy
peectures, the old al-queda.net NSA bait URL has been changed to
Responding to charges of 'language-ism', the Obfuscated C contest
opened itself to languages other than just C this year, and the clear
winner in the English category was our own John Young of cryptome.org.
"We don't have a clue what he's saying," the nominating committee
stated, "but we sure as hell know what he means." The judging
committee was impressed by Mr. Young's ability to be almost totally
incomprehensible while still getting his point across, and by the fact
that he had obviously attained bootstrap status, and in addition is
Turing complete. The debate over whether Mr. Young qualifies as P or
NP has yet to be resolved.
In a shout-out to the old DEFCON ritual of playing 'Spot the Fed',
the RSA Conference has announced a contest to 'Spot Tim May', the
winner receiving an 'I Outed Tim May' tee shirt and a personal
bodyguard for the conference duration. Interest appears to be
limited due to the boycott.
After a long absence, the Cypherpunks steering committee, due to
recent revelations about NSA spying, has once again opened One
Time Pad season. The early leader appears to be Ian Goldberg's (of UC
Berkeley's 'Glow in the Dark Campanile' fame) proposal to distribute
OTP bits via entangled photons, awaiting only Phillip Hallam-Baker's
work on developing a room-temperature Bose-Einstein condensate. Open
source programmers have already initiated a Kickstarter campaign to
develop a delivery method for the distribution of OTPs that would
avoid the internet completely and still be RFC 1149, 2549, and 6214
The NIST is facing further controversy following claims that it
intentionally 'backdoored' the Dual_EC_DRBG random number generator.
Now an IETF taskforce, after several months of study, has determined
that NIST's proposal to increase the security of a venerable UNIX
encryption algorithm by 'doubling the cycle length' actually makes
the algorithm more susceptible to cryptanalysis. Cryptographers are
recommending that all programs that use the new algorithm immediately revert to the old 'ROT13' standard.
Quote of the Week: "In conclusion, the main thing we did wrong when
designing ATM security systems in the early to mid-1980s was to worry
about criminals being clever; we should rather have worried about our
customers - the banks' system designers, implementers, and testers -
being stupid."

SCOTUS Justice Antonin Scalia was arrested yesterday and charged
with threatening to assassinate POTUS Barak Obama. Justice Scalia
was released 6 hours later after scientific vocal analysis of his
Skype call to Justice Samuel Alito revealed that his actual
statement was, "Let's kill the precedent". The FBI blamed the British
GCHQ for providing them a poor quality recording, to which a GCHQ
spokesperson replied that the recording was "exactly what the NSA
gave us". The Microsoft Corporation denied it provided any Skype
information to the NSA whatsoever via a press representative whose
trousers were quickly extinguished by an attentive aide.

Why not just get your own domain? For about $10/yr or so, you can set up your DNS/MX records to use any provider you want & fw your yahoo mail  (Stay away from GoDaddy.)
You should have a local backup of your own emails, is what Moon Jones was trying to say in a rude way.  Easily done with thunderbird.
Would be happy to help you set it up or advise if you need.
 By Moon Jones:>Actually the idiot is someone who just does not back up important data.>A double idiot I see. I guess that's the trouble with large providers:>they let anybody in. Hence the bad publicity.
 I assume Yahoo DOES 'back up important data'.  The problem here is
 different:  The Yahoo computer system probably (falsely) figured that there was suspicious activity going on.  (It probably saw my logon Sunday, while I was still logged on in another window, as being suspicious).  I did not anticipate that my doing what I did was going to be a problem.  The big problem is that the Yahoo computer system precipitately reacted, quite improperly, by not merely suspending the account, but by actually deleting the entire account!   This is the computer equivalent of 'insanity'.
I have heard it said that computer features that are infrequently (or even rarely) used do not tend to be perfected.  ("Software rot"; see       )   Since only rarely would this kind of situation occur, a bug in the system would tend not to be quickly found.  Also, you are wrong for a second reason.  Yahoo (or any other email provider) could easily set up their system to keep a backup of the email data on the user's computer.  While that data, too, would be vulnerable to various events, the probability that BOTH the 'cloud'-kept data AND the user-computer-kept data becoming unavailable simultaneously should be exceedingly low.  Probably one of the reasons Yahoo doesn't take this precaution is
 that they are trying to lock-in users to their system.  If they gave a user's computer a copy of the entire content of the user's data, it would be too easy (for Yahoo's purposes) for the user to transfer his data to another email system:  Competing email systems would be motivated to write software to adopt such data into a new account.Even so, I have done a Google search for an email-account transfer service.  (Turns out they exist!).  What I'd really like to do is to obtain a new email address, but simultaneously maintain 'jamesdbell8' as one email address, instructing yahoo to automatically transfer any incoming mail to a second address.  This feature would greatly ease the
 difficulty of transferring to a different email account.         Jim Bell  > My email provider, the idiots at Yahoo.com, crashed my email address> account 'jamesdbell8 last Sunday.   I have lost my email> addresses, as well as all emails.  For now, I will have to operate on a> new email address, 'jamesdbell9   At this point, Yahoo is my>  enemy, and I expect them to be "The first against the wall when the> revolution comes".>

   "Just when we thought we were out, they drag us back in ..."
Recently reviewed documents leaked by Edward Snowden reveal that,
following the discovery of large quantities of pornography on hard
drives retrieved from the Abbottabad compound where Osama bin Laden
was assassinated, the NSA became concerned that al Queda was using
steganographic techniques to hide various communications within the
jpgs and animated gifs, and began a program (known internally as
'Project Creampie') to collect all the pornography on the internet
into one giant database, presently located at the new NSA data
storage center in Bluffdale, Utah, that could be searched by
various interns and subcontractors. Progress has apparently been
slowed due to subcontractor Hewitt Packard's problems in designing
and building a computer keyboard impervious to "precious bodily
fluids". In response to the newly discovered NSA obsession with feelthy
peectures, the old al-queda.net NSA bait URL has been changed to
Responding to charges of 'language-ism', the Obfuscated C contest
opened itself to languages other than just C this year, and the clear
winner in the English category was our own John Young of cryptome.org.
"We don't have a clue what he's saying," the nominating committee
stated, "but we sure as hell know what he means." The judging
committee was impressed by Mr. Young's ability to be almost totally
incomprehensible while still getting his point across, and by the fact
that he had obviously attained bootstrap status, and in addition is
Turing complete. The debate over whether Mr. Young qualifies as P or
NP has yet to be resolved.
In a shout-out to the old DEFCON ritual of playing 'Spot the Fed',
the RSA Conference has announced a contest to 'Spot Tim May', the
winner receiving an 'I Outed Tim May' tee shirt and a personal
bodyguard for the conference duration. Interest appears to be
limited due to the boycott.
After a long absence, the Cypherpunks steering committee, due to
recent revelations about NSA spying, has once again opened One
Time Pad season. The early leader appears to be Ian Goldberg's (of UC
Berkeley's 'Glow in the Dark Campanile' fame) proposal to distribute
OTP bits via entangled photons, awaiting only Phillip Hallam-Baker's
work on developing a room-temperature Bose-Einstein condensate. Open
source programmers have already initiated a Kickstarter campaign to
develop a delivery method for the distribution of OTPs that would
avoid the internet completely and still be RFC 1149, 2549, and 6214
The NIST is facing further controversy following claims that it
intentionally 'backdoored' the Dual_EC_DRBG random number generator.
Now an IETF taskforce, after several months of study, has determined
that NIST's proposal to increase the security of a venerable UNIX
encryption algorithm by 'doubling the cycle length' actually makes
the algorithm more susceptible to cryptanalysis. Cryptographers are
recommending that all programs that use the new algorithm immediately revert to the old 'ROT13' standard.
Quote of the Week: "In conclusion, the main thing we did wrong when
designing ATM security systems in the early to mid-1980s was to worry
about criminals being clever; we should rather have worried about our
customers - the banks' system designers, implementers, and testers -
being stupid."

SCOTUS Justice Antonin Scalia was arrested yesterday and charged
with threatening to assassinate POTUS Barak Obama. Justice Scalia
was released 6 hours later after scientific vocal analysis of his
Skype call to Justice Samuel Alito revealed that his actual
statement was, "Let's kill the precedent". The FBI blamed the British
GCHQ for providing them a poor quality recording, to which a GCHQ
spokesperson replied that the recording was "exactly what the NSA
gave us". The Microsoft Corporation denied it provided any Skype
information to the NSA whatsoever via a press representative whose
trousers were quickly extinguished by an attentive aide.

Why not just get your own domain? For about $10/yr or so, you can set up your DNS/MX records to use any provider you want & fw your yahoo mail  (Stay away from GoDaddy.)
You should have a local backup of your own emails, is what Moon Jones was trying to say in a rude way.  Easily done with thunderbird.
Would be happy to help you set it up or advise if you need.
 By Moon Jones:>Actually the idiot is someone who just does not back up important data.>A double idiot I see. I guess that's the trouble with large providers:>they let anybody in. Hence the bad publicity.
 I assume Yahoo DOES 'back up important data'.  The problem here is
 different:  The Yahoo computer system probably (falsely) figured that there was suspicious activity going on.  (It probably saw my logon Sunday, while I was still logged on in another window, as being suspicious).  I did not anticipate that my doing what I did was going to be a problem.  The big problem is that the Yahoo computer system precipitately reacted, quite improperly, by not merely suspending the account, but by actually deleting the entire account!   This is the computer equivalent of 'insanity'.
I have heard it said that computer features that are infrequently (or even rarely) used do not tend to be perfected.  ("Software rot"; see       )   Since only rarely would this kind of situation occur, a bug in the system would tend not to be quickly found.  Also, you are wrong for a second reason.  Yahoo (or any other email provider) could easily set up their system to keep a backup of the email data on the user's computer.  While that data, too, would be vulnerable to various events, the probability that BOTH the 'cloud'-kept data AND the user-computer-kept data becoming unavailable simultaneously should be exceedingly low.  Probably one of the reasons Yahoo doesn't take this precaution is
 that they are trying to lock-in users to their system.  If they gave a user's computer a copy of the entire content of the user's data, it would be too easy (for Yahoo's purposes) for the user to transfer his data to another email system:  Competing email systems would be motivated to write software to adopt such data into a new account.Even so, I have done a Google search for an email-account transfer service.  (Turns out they exist!).  What I'd really like to do is to obtain a new email address, but simultaneously maintain 'jamesdbell8' as one email address, instructing yahoo to automatically transfer any incoming mail to a second address.  This feature would greatly ease the
 difficulty of transferring to a different email account.         Jim Bell  > My email provider, the idiots at Yahoo.com, crashed my email address> account 'jamesdbell8 at yahoo.com' last Sunday.   I have lost my email> addresses, as well as all emails.  For now, I will have to operate on a> new email address, 'jamesdbell9 at yahoo.com'.   At this point, Yahoo is my>  enemy, and I expect them to be "The first against the wall when the> revolution comes".>
