This page tests browser-fingerprinting using the AudioContext and Canvas
API. Using the AudioContext API to fingerprint does not collect sound
played or recorded by your machine - an AudioContext fingerprint is a
property of your machine's audio stack itself. If you choose to see your
fingerprint, we will collect the fingerprint along with a randomly
assigned identifier, your IP Address, and your User-Agent and store it
in a private database so that we can analyze the effectiveness of the
technique. We will not release the raw data publicly. A cookie will be
set in your browser to help in our analysis.
We also test a form of fingerprinting using Flash if you have Flash
enabled. This page is a part of Princeton CITP's Web Transparency and
Accountability Project.
