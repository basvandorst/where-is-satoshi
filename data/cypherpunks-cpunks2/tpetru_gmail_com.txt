@_subject: Bitmessage? 
I have found some relatively long thread
 with security
analysis and it does not seems like really rock solid protocol.
My personal experience is that most of the people I have tried
BitMessage with where not able to tolerate really long and unpredictable
latency of messages. During first week of tests we have tried to send
like 150 messages with friends and only circa half of them where
delivered, even none of us turned off client.
If you are not activist with month of time, to deliver all of your
followers invitation to prepared demonstration against spying on emails,
there is no use for this in the way, how it is implemented.
Another problem was -+2days of time, before client was fully synced with
network. In case, I'm not connected few weeks and than I need to wait 2
days again to fully sync... no use.
But it was just first impression, client deleted from hdd.

@_subject: [GnuPG] : Question - collective entity key management 
Hi all,
may I have a question?
I need to manage key for encrypt/sign of [not-only] e-mail communication
for group of peoplewhich is partially dynamic. Basically it is some
elected administrative board.
My ideawas to create some master key than subkeys and in case subkeys
are revoced [member of admin-board was not elected,whole admin-board is
re-elected etc.].
Problem is, that all of the members are using same email e.g.
As soon as member should not be able to read this email, his key should
be disallowed to decrypt messages on this email.
Can I ask for some HowTo or just correct my point of view, because it
seems definitely wrong.

@_subject: who are the service operators here? 
Joseph's question is really important not even for me, as for person,
who just want to try to run multi-purpose "home server". I think it is
good idea for some bigger Documentation and HowTo project, too.
Eugen's idea to have .ovf packages for different purposes is relevant too.
Both ideas still need to be answered, and seems to me even propagated,
so let me add one more question: Is there some Propaganda/Documentation
Project/HowTo Wiki for this purpose?
One of interesting .ovf I have found is *Liberté Linux*:
[seems to be kind of out-dated]
One of interesting "multi purpose, out of the box, home server" seems to
be this:
*arkOS: Building the anti-cloud (on a Raspberry Pi) - open source,
Raspberry Pi - Development - Techworld*
Both projects seems to be worth to add human power to and more propaganda.
*Tails*  seems to be paranoid enough to not to
support .ovf, or em'I wrong?
BTW all of mentioned projects are good hint, what is trend on side of
services but list of services and tools is still more than welcome.
Btw2: On this wiki, I'm tiring to complete list of user side apps for
different platforms, so it could be helpful too:

I'm using Tails inside virtual boxes only, because there is almost zero
possibility of local data theft or local attack in my case, much more
problematic is "Open Internet".
So I think they are too much paranoid for my purpose and could be good
idea to try to discuss it with them. Even I like design of Liberte Linux
more [smaller, faster, same amount of tools, encrypted filestystem
usable even under Windows...].
But we seems to be little bit OT, better to return back to question:
what server application to run these days for
I think people from FreedomBox thread & Tor thread should be able to
answer us best.
Btw I see FreedomBox as unusable overkill, but it is just my IMHO.
Too much crypto* == no usability for everyday purposes [which is
basically exactly, why I'm reading this mailing list and doing wiki].
We must count with users as my mother is. She is able to encrypt/sign
e-mail with Enigmail and use OTR and TrueCrypt... that is good example,
where all of this should lead on user level.
e.g. Pidgin + OTR plugin, Thunderbird + Enigmail, Ubuntu -- good user
experience, not really much ponts, where even my Mother "can do it
completely wrong" ... it is Facebook century, even most stupid or
non-techie from primary school are on netz. Nobody cares about mailing
lists and bbses anymore. Time to do it completely transparent [really
gr8 job Enigmail !!!] --> Tails is killing itself because crypto*
overkill even on web now
[even I understand it could be good to have complex, it should not be
default... propaganda and education should not kill usability, even it
IS fu*ng important]
Smart aPUNK study and is able to configure server, but does not
understand elliptic curves on math level. Still MUCH better to
understand concepts and be able to run it relatively fast and secure,
than undrstand math and not 2 be able to do revolution, eh?

So now you have rouge ex-player who do understand whole "system"

And as cypher it just behave as cypher with hidden logic, which does not
work as soon as logic is revealed.

@_subject: Fwd: [ PFIR ] The "Sharing Economy" Is the Problem 
Something feels here like sand in cogwheel... so what? So we have
invented we can share our resources, which is positive from social side
same as from ecological.
Now we should decide if to kill whole idea for everybody, or just create
new market, where you can fight to win?
Where is bonus of NOT to allow sharing of cars as business?
I have been in some countries where no such thing as public transport
does really exists and this model is there on voluntary and kapitalistic
basic for years and why not.
In our country to get cab, like one from that approved companies is
usually ... stupid. They will rob you, they will dictate their rules,
what you can and what you can't. It is closed market without any
progress for years.
I do expect argument, that legal taxi at least pay taxes and some social
security and all that. You can be sure, they know town or city and they
know how to drive.
Hmm. OK, one correct thing is, that they are doing special driving
license to be allowed to drive cab. That is all.
Price is 40% higher than Uber, service is usually much worse and even
Prague as city is not able to get a rid of this taxi mafia. Czech people
do not need taxi, because we can easily get a bus, tram, trolleybus,
train ... wherever we want, so they are just robbing tourists. Uber and

Btw. I have heard nice thing from one of random people at some musical gig:

Really? So what is purpose of this thread if I can ask? To complain that
ordinary people are sheep?
Whata new approach whata invention.
What do you expect? Why people are so easily pressed and tend to follow
dictators? Why somebody even tend to be solider or why people do eat
meet when it is not necessary.
I know there will be a lot of chain of arguing against controversy of
eating meet now.
Please fck this. We already know, that most of people will never care
about crypto without our help.
I feel mood on this thread as mood of angry barking dog but pretty
toothless. We are not.
We can teach, script and just do it better and without extreme barriers
for people to adopt crypto seamlessly.
We do not need to have it perfect, same as robots are not perfect when
driving. It is just enough to be better than average.
Telegram is step [however crypto is implemented], Open Whisper Systems
is doing huge amount of work.
No reason of this half bitter and half angry tone.
Now it could be right time to stand against nonsense regulation again.
It happened already in time of PIPA, SOPA...

Whata hell of news, that email is not and never ever been secure
communication method. Same as Moxie defined SMS as hell of unsecure
because of metadata.
We know that already no? Same way we know that Web Of Trust is huge leak
of trust and security.
But count with GPG/PGP on long run. It could be important now who are
you talking with but it could be possible that on long run will be
important what are you telling.
Fact is that statistical analysis is bitch and it is pretty hard to hide
all kind of metadata traces you are producing.
Minimalize damage use at least encryption on level of email content.
OTR over facebook chat or Google chat protocol or whatever will leak
same amount of metadata because you share willingly when you are online
sometimes contact or who are you talking with.
This sword have two edges - we want to communicate and mostly socialise
but we do not want to leak who do we make love during lunch break with,
Paranoia is nice and expected thing here but lets think reasonably -
usability versus security.
Of course could be really nice idea to strip all metadata from our
communication on some practical level but lest admit that email will
never be worth that work and it was never ever designed like that.

Been at the doctor last week and just because I was bored b waiting scan
showed me that his wiifi for patients is shared with is laptop where
medial records are stored and only barrier is WEP.
In one pub I have been all payments transactions are processed through
PC with Windows connected to same net as unencrypted free wiifi
hotspot... everybody with smartphone/notebook and netmap and wireshark
can just read.
Fact is that security by obscurity still does work and again it is
double edged sword. In case you will want to have educated masses to
understand technology in the way they understand how vulnerable they are
at that same moment you will find how vulnerable is whole society. It is
probably good idea that normal people do not think about how easy is to
break this glass to just go into somebody house...
Do not be evil is basic rule here. How many sysadmins/sysops have root
password to whatever we are doing? To all of our identities and our
traces. Who of you can download half of today human knowhow just by one
smarter script... imho most of us.
And here we are technological leaders who decided not to fraud and
destroy. This is long time know story about good and about bad.
Common sense here seems like: ok we are good and gov is bad. Partially
agree because gov tend to be bunch of criminals after all [with more or
less visible motives].
Where this idea is heeding? Hard to say, it is not complete yet. But
open source is as important as never before after somebody decided we
are suppose to pay for copyright. Cryptography is more or less public
know how between at least some part of educated people. Kids in pubs are
talking about quality of encrypton of software they have in their smart
It is not self sustaining system nor gov or criminals are. It is about
work to be done after all. But I tend to be optimistic.

Thinking about connotations of crypto that could be backdoored as
protection against terrorism or some similar stupid rhetoric:
- ok, lets agree we are going to prohibit crypto...
- so every sysop will now return to telnet
- all banks are going to send money over telegraph in pure morse code,
same apply for telco operators - no GSM encryption
... no no... I meant it for ordinary people only.
Hmm, and who exactly is that ordinary man or woman? Somebody who do not
have web page, bank account, never used cell phone?
How somebody could logically ban something that we all are using everyday?
Back to that terrorist protection logic: in case we will agree that
normal ordinary people are suspect to be terrorist does it mean that
sysop or banker is not suspected same when we allow to use them strong
And one last point that can help as to prove whole nonsense: do we want
to give our imaginary terrorist power to read complete communication of
all of us "ordinary people"?
IMHO during 2WW there was logic: not to tell enemy single word. So lets
reverse this anti-terrorist "logic": We need strong cryptography in
public domain just to protect us ordinary people against potential
terrorist spying.

This debate is little bit over edge because of its explicitly political.
Thing is that I do not believe that in democratic country government is
something more or other than ordinary people [in totalitarianism country
it is little bit different because than government is usually bunch of
mass murders].
What is my point? Discussion and strong arguments even smart propaganda
can change a lot.
I've met our first democratic president Vaclav Havel and I tend to meet
politics during or ofter some civic actions, I have right to care and
right to discuss things with politics. I could even be one of them and
there are just people.
They do not know, they do not understand, they are afraid of ask... as
most or all of us.
We already know that governments will not disappear. That idea is
strongly decentralized and have a lot of side control mechanisms. So we
should count with government same as criminality, drugs, police,
military or violence against woman. It is just here and we should be
prepared not to attack [to read about German RAF could be interesting,
because terrorist managed to be government for some time, or at least
change its decisions, but do we really pour oil in fire of brutality,
is  that really needed?].
So think about governments as about "ordinary people" most of em' will
never be able to sign their email and most of them never used ssh. That
is part of our work, to show them why my argument *fly*, how much
cryptography is needed to have at least some way stable society without
basic holes. I do not care about *system* anymore I care about society
and I do love word citizen. That is what my parents where fighting for

OTR over facebook chat or Google chat protocol or whatever will leak
same amount of metadata because you share willingly when you are online
sometimes contact or who are you talking with.
This sword have two edges - we want to communicate and mostly socialise
but we do not want to leak who do we make love during lunch break with,
Paranoia is nice and expected thing here but lets think reasonably -
usability versus security.
Of course could be really nice idea to strip all metadata from our
communication on some practical level but lest admit that email will
never be worth that work and it was never ever designed like that.

Been at the doctor last week and just because I was bored b waiting scan

In one pub I have been all payments transactions are processed through

Fact is that security by obscurity still does work and again it is
double edged sword. In case you will want to have educated masses to
understand technology in the way they understand how vulnerable they are
at that same moment you will find how vulnerable is whole society. It is
probably good idea that normal people do not think about how easy is to
break this glass to just go into somebody house...
Do not be evil is basic rule here. How many sysadmins/sysops have root
password to whatever we are doing? To all of our identities and our
traces. Who of you can download half of today human knowhow just by one
smarter script... imho most of us.
And here we are technological leaders who decided not to fraud and
destroy. This is long time know story about good and about bad.
Common sense here seems like: ok we are good and gov is bad. Partially
agree because gov tend to be bunch of criminals after all [with more or
less visible motives].
Where this idea is heeding? Hard to say, it is not complete yet. But
open source is as important as never before after somebody decided we
are suppose to pay for copyright. Cryptography is more or less public
know how between at least some part of educated people. Kids in pubs are
talking about quality of encrypton of software they have in their smart
It is not self sustaining system nor gov or criminals are. It is about
work to be done after all. But I tend to be optimistic.

Thinking about connotations of crypto that could be backdoored as
protection against terrorism or some similar stupid rhetoric:
- ok, lets agree we are going to prohibit crypto...
- so every sysop will now return to telnet
- all banks are going to send money over telegraph in pure morse code,
same apply for telco operators - no GSM encryption
... no no... I meant it for ordinary people only.
Hmm, and who exactly is that ordinary man or woman? Somebody who do not
have web page, bank account, never used cell phone?
How somebody could logically ban something that we all are using everyday?
Back to that terrorist protection logic: in case we will agree that
normal ordinary people are suspect to be terrorist does it mean that
sysop or banker is not suspected same when we allow to use them strong
And one last point that can help as to prove whole nonsense: do we want
to give our imaginary terrorist power to read complete communication of
all of us "ordinary people"?
IMHO during 2WW there was logic: not to tell enemy single word. So lets
reverse this anti-terrorist "logic": We need strong cryptography in
public domain just to protect us ordinary people against potential
terrorist spying.

This debate is little bit over edge because of its explicitly political.
Thing is that I do not believe that in democratic country government is
something more or other than ordinary people [in totalitarianism country
it is little bit different because than government is usually bunch of
mass murders].
What is my point? Discussion and strong arguments even smart propaganda
can change a lot.
I've met our first democratic president Vaclav Havel and I tend to meet
politics during or ofter some civic actions, I have right to care and
right to discuss things with politics. I could even be one of them and
there are just people.
They do not know, they do not understand, they are afraid of ask... as
most or all of us.
We already know that governments will not disappear. That idea is
strongly decentralized and have a lot of side control mechanisms. So we
should count with government same as criminality, drugs, police,
military or violence against woman. It is just here and we should be
prepared not to attack [to read about German RAF could be interesting,
because terrorist managed to be government for some time, or at least
change its decisions, but do we really pour oil in fire of brutality,
is  that really needed?].
So think about governments as about "ordinary people" most of em' will
never be able to sign their email and most of them never used ssh. That
is part of our work, to show them why my argument *fly*, how much
cryptography is needed to have at least some way stable society without
basic holes. I do not care about *system* anymore I care about society
and I do love word citizen. That is what my parents where fighting for
during velvet revolution.

Is here somebody who was able to follow this topic during recent

Of course it given totalitarian government another reason why and what

Just question to plenum: do we know, why eg. Enigmail is not standard
part of Thunderbird?
It is extremely confortable and easy way how to encrypt emails.
Same counts for Pidgin and OTR plugin... e.g. Adium do have crypto as
standard part.
Isn't it possible that more we are paranoid about merging plugins to
upstream clients code more barriers we are putting between ordinary user
and crypto?
Btw. I have heard nice thing from one of random people at some musical gig:
"Today young are bunch of idiots they do not care about any system
without *that crypto*"
It made me laugh.
This proposition of law not so much. Is there some legal way how to say
"NO THANK YOU"?
We know already that CCTV is not way to make streets safer place same as
prohibition of drugs will not cause end of its abusing.
IMHO there is no reason to prohibit something in case you want to get a
rid of it. It just does not work.

Really? So what is purpose of this thread if I can ask? To complain that
ordinary people are sheep?
Whata new approach whata invention.
What do you expect? Why people are so easily pressed and tend to follow
dictators? Why somebody even tend to be solider or why people do eat
meet when it is not necessary.
I know there will be a lot of chain of arguing against controversy of
eating meet now.
Please fck this. We already know, that most of people will never care
about crypto without our help.
I feel mood on this thread as mood of angry barking dog but pretty
toothless. We are not.
We can teach, script and just do it better and without extreme barriers
for people to adopt crypto seamlessly.
We do not need to have it perfect, same as robots are not perfect when
driving. It is just enough to be better than average.
Telegram is step [however crypto is implemented], Open Whisper Systems
is doing huge amount of work.
No reason of this half bitter and half angry tone.
Now it could be right time to stand against nonsense regulation again.
It happened already in time of PIPA, SOPA...
So lets bark on right target not to "ordinary people".

Whata hell of news, that email is not and never ever been secure
communication method. Same as Moxie defined SMS as hell of unsecure
because of metadata.
We know that already no? Same way we know that Web Of Trust is huge leak
of trust and security.
But count with GPG/PGP on long run. It could be important now who are
you talking with but it could be possible that on long run will be
important what are you telling.
Fact is that statistical analysis is bitch and it is pretty hard to hide
all kind of metadata traces you are producing.
