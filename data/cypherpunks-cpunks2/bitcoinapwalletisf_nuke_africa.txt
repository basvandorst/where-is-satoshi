I will try to keep my post as easy to digest as possible, but this is a
lot of information that actually stems back to cpunks and the help of a
very based anon.
1. Pre-August 2017 - /pol/ anon makes post warning other anons about the
implications of the User-Activated Soft Fork on Bitcoin's blockchain.
This User-Activated Soft Fork activates software called Segregated
Witness, a "scaling solution" funded by a company called Blockstream,
who happens to be funded by venture capital groups. This "network
upgrade" initiates on August 8th 2017, and if all the miners do not
follow the abundance of nodes on the network, a chain split results,
which looks terrible for Bitcoin. Because of this, and previous
arrangements that will benefit the miners later on, Segwit is activated.
Right before activation, Roger Ver states that he does not agree with
what SegWit claims to do for Bitcoin, and in turn hard forks the network
in order to preserve Bitcoin's ecosystem before this radical upgrade
took place.
WHAT IS SEGWIT?
Segregated Witness is a software upgrade that forces every-day users
such as you and I off of the main blockchain. It does this using a
fee-based "solution". Fees to broadcast to the main blockchain are
raised x1000, going from less than $1 to $1000 EOY 2018. Instead,
average users will go through Side-Chains - a patented software that
allows banks to control their own centralized blockchains, this means
that they choose the transactions that will and will not be allowed to
be broadcasted to the main blockchain, while you as an individual must
pay them a fee to even use the sidechains. This means that banks have
control over who can and cannot send money, something that was
previously not possible with Bitcoin.
2. Post-August 2017
Roger Ver splits the Bitcoin blockchain with his hardfork, resulting in
a new Bitcoin offspring named "Bitcoin Cash (BCH)" - Bitcoin Cash
follows the original roadmap laid out by Bitcoin creator Satoshi
Nakamoto, while Bitcoin (BTC) is now a science project of Bitcoin Core
and Blockstream. Nothing is too bad on 4chan, a lot of people talking
shit about Bitcoin Cash, but from my perspective it seems to be pure
ignorance rather than any actual shilling.
WHAT IS BITCOIN CASH?
Bitcoin Cash is the original idea of Bitcoin, laid out by the creator of
Bitcoin, and using solutions that Satoshi Nakamoto explicitly states
exist for the future of the currency. These solutions allow for Bitcoin
to scale according to the amount of users on the network, without the
high-fee-based scalability model. This means that regardless of whether
you are rich or poor, if you have Bitcoin Cash (BCH) you can broadcast
your transaction to the blockchain for close to nothing.
Censorship-resistant money.
3. Bitcoin Cash Gains A Foothold
As Bitcoin's (BTC) fees grow in price, less people begin to use it, the
promise of Lightning Network and Sidechains are still being worked on,
according to Core and Blockstream, but as of now, there is no immediate
solution to these people. Raising the blocksize past 1MB is not
possible. In turn, many businesses begin to drop Bitcoin, some turning
to Bitcoin Cash, which results in newfound confidence and a new floor @
$1000 USD. At this point, 4chan begins to see many people shilling
against Bitcoin Cash and either attempting to point people's attention
toward alt-coins as the successor to Bitcoin, rather than Bitcoin Cash,
which shares the same Genesis Block with Bitcoin.
WHAT COINS ARE BEING SHILLED?
With the failure of BTC being just around the corner, shills see this as
an opportunity to begin their attack. They choose very specific coins
for a VERY specific reason. Ethereum and Litecoin are the main alts
being shilled.
WHY ETHEREUM?
Ethereum Enterprise Alliance - search it.
WHY LITECOIN?
Litecoin, created by Charlie Lee, is a fork of Bitcoin created in or
around 2013. What is so special about Litecoin? Nothing anymore. The
most notable feature though, would be Segregated Witness, which was
activated on Litecoin FAR before it was activated on Bitcoin. Since
Segwit is software owned by Blockstream, if the majority of Bitcoin's
market cap were to flow into Litecoin, banks would have won regardless
of whether BTC dies or not. Either way both have Segwit activated, so
Blockstream and banks win.
4. Bitcoin Cash Begins to Suck the Life Out of Bitcoin
As of Nov 15th 2017, Bitcoin Cash has begun to absorb Bitcoin's market
dominance at a rapid rate, swinging between .1 and .3 Satoshi in
comparison to BTC. Eventually Bitcoin Cash is projected to be at a 1:1
ratio with BTC, and afterwards will kill BTC completely, as they both
work using the same hardware and mining algorithms. Bitcoin Cash has
some added features including an adjusted DAA that stop miners from
being able to kill the network by making it to expensive to mine at a
loss when hashpower is removed. In other words, Bitcoin Cash's
blockchain is a lot stronger and more resistant to the chain-death
spiral that could completely (and will) kill Bitcoin.
5. Coinbrase adds Bitcoin Cash
As of Dec 20th 2017, Coinbrase announces that it will add Bitcoin Cash
as a USD pair, shaking confidence in BTC and bringing the market down
for a short period of time. Due to not enough liquidity, the price of
Bitcoin Cash shoots from $4000 USD to $9000 USD within 6 minutes, and
coinbrase disables trading, as they do not believe the price is healthy
and may be manipulated.
WHY IS ANY OF THIS IMPORTANT?
As Bitcoin Cash has grown, BTC has began to die, which ultimately was
the plan of banks anyway, they never wanted Bitcoin to work. They want
to kill it or control it, now they have a big issue to deal with.
Anyone calling Bitcoin Cash "Bcash" is doing so in an attempt at
shifting the narrative and pulling Bitcoin Cash away from the "Bitcoin"

Recommendation on how to redeem Bitcoin Cash
July 31st, 2017.
Electrum is a Bitcoin wallet created by Thomas Voegtlin in 2011.
Electrum is distributed by Electrum Technologies GmbH, a company
registered in Germany, using the website Electrum users who are not interested in Bitcoin Cash do not need to
worry nor to take any particular action. The following note is only
for users who want to access their Bitcoin Cash (BCC).
"Electron Cash" is a fork of Electrum for Bitcoin Cash. Electron Cash
is not endorsed by Electrum. It is open source, and binaries
(executables files) are available for Windows, OSX and
Android. However, when you run binaries instead of source code, you
have no guarantee that they match the source code. This is why wallet
binaries are usually signed by developers. A digital signature engages
the responsibility of the person who signs.
The person who distributes the Electron Cash binaries has decided to
remain anonymous, and uses the fake name "Jonald Fyookball" in order
to sign Electron Cash binaries. Thus, if these binaries contain code
that is designed to steal your bitcoins, the author of the theft will
be anonymous and walk away safely with your funds.
This danger is exacerbated by the fact that the default behavior of
Electron Cash is to silently copy all your Electrum wallets into its
own directory. Thus, if you run Electron Cash on a machine where you
previously used Electrum, all your pre-existing wallets will be
available in Electron Cash, and you will only need to enter your
password in order to expose your bitcoins to potential theft.
Therefore, users who want to run the Electron Cash binaries should do
it on a separate machine, that does not have their Bitcoin wallet. We
recommend to proceed as follows:
 1. Install Electron Cash on a machine that does not have your
 Electrum wallets.
 2. Wait until the BCC hard fork has taken place, and a few BCC blocks
 have been mined.
 3. Move all your Electrum funds to a new Electrum wallet. This will
 move only your BTC, and not your BCC, because the BCC blockchain has
 replay protection. Wait until the transaction is confirmed.
 4. Enter the seed of your (now empty) old wallet or private keys in
 Electron Cash. Since the BTC have been moved to a new wallet,
 entering your old seed in Electron Cash will not put your BTC funds
 at risk.
Following these 4 easy steps you will be able to access your BCC
without compromising your BTC.
