Some conspiracists conjectured this might have happened in the fatal,
fiery crash of the investigative journalist Michael Hastings in L.A.,
but without hard evidence it's the purview of the credulous prone to
conspiracy theories rather than an actual one (of which there are many).
Attacks had been publicly demonstrated by then. Such intrusions would be
hard to trace (especially without access to do the forensics). If it
hasn't happened yet, it will in the future. People will continue to use
smart cars as it's convenient and will be entrenched and socialized in
by the time hoi polloi would begin to appreciate the danger. The smart
car tech will also be collecting that much more info on users in the

It's not a matter of credulity in believing that authorities would carry
out such an assassination, the problem is asserting such an act without
direct evidence. As I said, and as insider Richard Clarke said, it would
be difficult to show.
"What has been revealed as a result of some research at universities is
that it's relatively easy to hack your way into the control system of a
car, and to do such things as cause acceleration when the driver doesn't
want acceleration, to throw on the brakes when the driver doesn't want
the brakes on, to launch an air bag,"
"in the case of Michael Hastings, what evidence is available publicly is
consistent with a car cyber attack. And the problem with that is you
can't prove it."
It's a conundrum uncovering such operations. If the US has not taken
such acts yet, it, and others, will do so. It's akin to the older
problem of knowing if someone was poisoned in a way to appear as a
natural malady. Intel agencies have long used such measures.

@_subject: NSA/FBI monitoring 
The NSA provides data to the FBI and DEA, among others. Although it was
known previously, this is part of what Snowden released with
corroborating documentation. That it hasn't gotten more attention, by
Greenwald, Snowden, et al, is one of the major credible complaints since
the releases began in June 2013. The FBI does do its own surveillance
and can easily tap telecoms with programs such as DCSNet and Red Hook,
but they don't have the resources (as far I know) to do the blanket
surveillance that NSA (and GCHQ, CSE, etc) does. NSA collects nearly all
internet traffic in the USA with its intercept rooms at the network
control centers that big telecoms have on the internet backbone. They
gather almost everything, including content, not just metadata. The
announced capacity of the Bluffton, Utah data center is several orders
of magnitude more than is needed to store metadata alone.
So, yes, some NSA data is shared with the FBI (and others) but the
details matter. There is FBI surveillance but NSA does the blanket
surveillance. With the FBI, as far as I know, you have to be targeted
(except for the IMSI catcher type stuff, which are indiscriminate but
not an nationwide/international dragnet). The AP story about the FBI
surveillance planes is quite interesting, although fits with recent info
and long term trends.

circumvents certain controls and accountability that don't apply to
companies. All major telecom companies have worked closely and secretly
with government spying since their inceptions. Both need each other. You
should also look into FBI's DITU in addition to DCSNet, Red Hook, and
such specific technologies.

@_subject: US Nat'l Academies formalizes cooperation with intel agencies to 
Spy agencies team up with National Academies
Expanded ties include new board, first-ever survey of social sciences
and security
By Jeffrey Mervis
In an unprecedented move, U.S. intelligence agencies are teaming up with
the nation’s most prestigious scientific body in a bid to make better
use of findings from the country’s leading social and behavioral scientists.
The partnership between the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence (ODNI) in Tysons Corner, Virginia, and the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine aims to build bridges
between communities that historically have either ignored one another or
butted heads. The effort includes the creation of a permanent
Intelligence Community Studies Board at the academies, which will meet
for the first time next week, as well as a first-ever study of how
social and behavioral science research might strengthen national security.
David Honey, ODNI director of science and technology under Director of
National Intelligence James Clapper, says he hopes that the new
partnership will help the intelligence community improve how it collects
and analyzes information. He and others are eager for help picking out
useful and relevant research, as well as grasping where there is a lack
of good science. Understanding “the limitations of our knowledge,” says
Robert Fein, a national security psychologist in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, and a member of the new intelligence board, “will help to
protect us against armies of snake oil salesmen.”
One area in dire need of better research is figuring out when people are
lying, Fein says.
After the start of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, he notes,
intelligence agencies poured money into research on both
mechanical-—think polygraphs—-and behavioral-—think
interrogations—-methods of detecting deception. But the results were
disappointing, recalls Fein, who led a 2006 report on interrogation
techniques for the director of national intelligence. “Researchers
overpromised,” he says, “and there were few useful results after
millions of dollars were spent.”
Even research that generated solid results had serious flaws, he adds.
“For example, none of the studies [of deception] involved people who
didn’t speak English,” Fein notes, making them of questionable value for
use in many current hot spots around the globe.
Last week, Honey harvested the first fruits of the fledgling
collaboration at a 2-day public summit in Washington,  D.C., designed to
feed ideas into the upcoming survey of social and behavioral science.
Prominent researchers presented talks on everything from decision-making
under stress to how social media fuel conspiracy theories. In addition,
a panel of intelligence analysts offered a rare glimpse into their
classified world and how scientific results need to be tweaked before
they can be applied to intelligence and policy.
“Scholars like to say, ‘In general, X is the case.’ But as
practitioners, we are asked to respond to a specific situation,”
explained Charles Gaukel of the National Intelligence Council in
Washington, D.C., which consists of senior officials from each of the 16
intelligence agencies across the government. Gaukel also debunked the
popular notion that intelligence analysts try to forecast global events.
“Our role is not to make predictions,” he said. “Rather, we try to give
policy-makers a sense of what’s out there, and how the enemy is likely
to respond.”
The new survey won’t follow the usual blueprint for so-called decadal
surveys, which look ahead 10 years. Traditionally, decadal studies help
a particular discipline, such as astrophysics or geoscience, set
priorities among competing facilities and projects. They may also
recommend how federal agencies can fill gaps and maximize their research
In contrast, the new study won’t seek to balance competing demands for
scientific facilities or examine existing research portfolios at the
intelligence agencies. Instead, Honey hopes it will identify current and
future research areas that might be useful for national security.
Speaking at the summit, Fein suggested that those on the decadal survey
might want to convene a panel of intelligence practitioners who would
propose areas “that might benefit from the relevant perspectives, data,
and knowledge” of social and behavioral scientists.
“I can’t forecast what we will learn” from the study, Honey says. “But
the history of decadal studies shows their value in pointing to where
the research community is headed.”
The survey is expected to take 2 years, and more than 300 people have
been nominated for the panel’s 18 slots. Despite that strong show of
interest, some scientists who support the effort worry that  getting involved could harm their research because of public unease about the
spy agencies’ activities.
“I’m a citizen scientist, and I think this collaboration is great,” says
Paul Glimcher, a neuroeconomist at New York University in New York City
who spoke at the summit about the Kavli HUMAN project, a deep dive into
the behavior and characteristics of 10,000 New York City residents that
he leads. But he says his team has “promised our subjects that the data
will never be shared with the government. And I’m concerned they might
react negatively to my being involved in a study funded by U.S.
intelligence agencies.”
Some observers see the new intelligence board as a successor to an ODNI
science advisory panel that Clapper abolished after becoming the
nation’s top spy in 2010. “It seems like at least an admission that the
abandonment of [that advisory board] was a mistake and that there is an
important role for independent advice from academics to the intelligence
community,” says Steven Aftergood, who leads the government secrecy
project at the Federation of American Scientists in Washington, D.C.
Gaukel may have inadvertently given the pending decadal survey its
marching orders during his summit talk on what intelligence analysts do.
“We’re looking for truth,” he said. “But we’re particularly looking for
truth that works.”

This is unsurprising but it's now confirmed via search warrant
documentation that ICE is using a cell site simulator/IMSI catcher
described as a Hailstorm or a Stingray
to surveil and prosecute undocumented immigrants. Journalists and ACLU
(probably others) are making FOIA requests and will likely need to sue.
Cell site simulators were kept mostly secret for about a decade after
introduction for domestic use and local departments were required by FBI
or manufacturer to conceal their use from judges and defense counsels.
In some cases, such as St. Louis, prosecutors dropped charges against
defendants who had cell site simulators used against them. Cell site
simulators are *strongly* suspected of being used against protesters in
Chicago, St. Louis/Ferguson, and Minneapolis, and known to have been
used in Standing Rock
 ,
including delivering malware payloads. ICE joins dozens of state and
local law enforcement agencies, and FBI, USMS, ATF, DEA, IRS, FCC, NSA,
and various military entities.
 Given the military-industrial-surveillance complex and that a moderately
skilled hacker can construct one, they are no doubt in use by private
security and intelligence agencies, as well, with G4S and
Academi/Xe/Blackwater certainly coming to mind.
So use the crypto (Signal or others), to the extent that it protects
content in transit. Some cell site simulators' imitation convinces
phones to decrypt the carrier's encryption. If a device can be infected
then even measures like Signal may be circumvented. We need more
privacy-by-design and hardened devices.

introduction for domestic use and local departments were required by FBI
or manufacturer to conceal their use from judges and defense counsels.
In some cases, such as St. Louis, prosecutors dropped charges against
defendants who had cell site simulators used against them. Cell site
simulators are *strongly* suspected of being used against protesters in
Chicago, St. Louis/Ferguson, and Minneapolis, and known to have been
used in Standing Rock
 ,
including delivering malware payloads. ICE joins dozens of state and
local law enforcement agencies, and FBI, USMS, ATF, DEA, IRS, FCC, NSA,
and various military entities.
 Given the military-industrial-surveillance complex and that a moderately
skilled hacker can construct one, they are no doubt in use by private
security and intelligence agencies, as well, with G4S and
Academi/Xe/Blackwater certainly coming to mind.
So use the crypto (Signal or others), to the extent that it protects
content in transit. Some cell site simulators' imitation convinces
phones to decrypt the carrier's encryption. If a device can be infected
then even measures like Signal may be circumvented. We need more
privacy-by-design and hardened devices.

It seems the advent of this would add impetus to implementing the option
for crypto signatures to ease and solidify confirming authenticity when
creating a video, either at production level or recording from a capture

TigerSwan, a competitor to Academi and G4S, (unsurprisingly) may need to
be added to this list per the documents released by The Intercept.
This evidence is not proof (there could potentially be other uses of the
IMEI number or they could be collecting that to pass on to government
entities that then IMEI/IMSI numbers through their catchers), but is
certainly suggestive:
