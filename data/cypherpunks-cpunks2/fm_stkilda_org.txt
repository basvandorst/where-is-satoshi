mod_ssl" does
 not verify

**A verification of this security announcement mail fails**
The key is signed by Vinnie Moscaritolo - vinnie at vmeng.com which is a good
thing even if Vinnie is no longer at Apple ( which is a bad thing ), it is
also signed by someone who does not appear on any of the public keyservers
that I can find which is a bit disappointing.
Verified version is at the bottom.
