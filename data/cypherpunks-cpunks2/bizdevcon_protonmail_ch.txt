potential attack whereas plain-text in an email is not.

If you check for packets moving but see nothing, it only proves that
it's _currently_ not recording. It's the capability that they _can_ turn
it on via a push update is what get me. And all it takes is a warrant if
you're a US citizen. If not a US citizen, you're fair game.

@_subject: Apple At-Rest Encryption 
Polemic question: how do you want to propose default File Vault encryption when I see most people using 0000 as their default iPhone password?
Real question: using encryption also forces one to thing about a proper backup strategy. And where will the average user store his FileVault key for each device? I remember one service (not sure which one) which forces you to store and print a backup key. You cannot / could not copy and paste: disabled! (I think it was even some Apple service.)
Default File Vault is neat but forget "recovering" stuff when your wife/kid/mom/dog forgets the passcodeâ¦ The recent death of my father also made me think of implementing a "two-level" personal privacy:
1) Things you want others like relatives to have access to in the ultimate scenario of death.
2) Things you want to keep private forever.
My dad never thought about such and his social accounts are as much protected as mundane information on insurance information of a shared property. In other words: I have a hard time unbundling everything and I am even thinking of taking a strong magnet and let it do the final task on his iMacâ¦
Long post, short summary: we need to rethink storing personal information before enabling things like File Vault for everyone.

You should turn it on. The battery effect on the CPU is negligible; itâs using AES-NI in the processor and thatâs running at less than one clock per byte. But if youâre on a computer that has flash â like any of the Air/Retina machines â the write time and power requirements of NAND flash are much better when you use a whitening function, of which AES makes a great one.
But in any event, itâs all going to be not worth worrying about in the costs. You might even benefit. You are also gaining in the security end. We can certainly debate whatever the operational security benefits are from encrypting your disk, but the real benefit comes from when you inevitably decommission that machine and storage. You are vastly, vastly better off with encrypted storage then, and better off for having encrypted it all along.

The USA is historically chasing companies and individuals laundering money or paying bribes using "US networks for money transfer" aka SWIFT. One of the most prolific cases with SWIFT was the USA versus the Swiss company ABB. If the USA cannot get a handle they will submit the case back to the country of origin's justice department.
On the first look of the FIFA case it shows that it is mostly about South American individuals and multi-national companies â all having ties back to the USA. It is a developing story thoughâ¦

On the "FIFA CASE", Douglas Rankine wrote some very important words:
As international law develops throughout the world, the power of a global arrest warrant will increase and its jurisdiction and extent and use will also increase. One awaits the day when it will be used against Russia, China or India.  Switzerland is a small country and although having many rich and powerful institutions, is falling far behind the big players on the world scene. Assange, and wiki leaks and reporters and journalists and whistleblowers all over the world, beware, this doctrine applies not only to terrorists, child molesters and criminals. Big brother is not only watching you, but he is recording your every move, and whenever or wherever you get in his way, he will get you...
It relates to many people on this list.
Be aware. Or should I say "be careful"?
