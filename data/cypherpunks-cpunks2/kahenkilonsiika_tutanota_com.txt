I believe "call for harm" might be seen as a way to trully enforce personal responsibility of politicians. If the bet was simply about being or not being in office, it wouldn't really mean much.

Nothing makes me happier than seeing these plastic-jew slaves in troubles :-)).
Wonder if this will have any effect on advancements of cashless  economies (mostly looking at you sweden). Aaand the answer is "no".

But tbh that doesn't really explain why you don't protect yourself against such things. Yeah, apparently you were taunting them, so you at least could have expected some reaction.

@_subject: Linux Torvalds finally hits the bag time - TDS Torvalds 
I have strong reasons to believe this might be part of operation to take over Linux by secret services or some other malicious entity. Linux is Linuses child, he wouldn't incorporate any kind of backdoors (some might remember his answer about incorporating backdoor and if he was approachet - and he definitely was as one can see in the video). That's why he needed to go. Now other noncooperating developers will be kicked away under some fabricated nigger/feminist/homo reason (and it's already happening - Theo Ts'o). Then ((they)) are free to take over.
