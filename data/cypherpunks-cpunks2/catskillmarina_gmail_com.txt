Mirimir - trying to make it about being trans is why i went after you.
The reality of trans life is not immunity. It is generally
discrimination and needing to watch your 6 for someone who is after you
for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Wonder why i might want strong encryption and privacy ?

not leak that info. ...Not that i support that horrid dictator. I did

Nonsense. Trump did not get the right info - he did not know how well
defended the site was. It was not a leak that made the attack fail it
was overly hasty action. Even Obama (the bomber) did not want to do that
action - he knew it as ill advised but the Chump was all go to do it not
knowing what was there on the ground - and it got a lot of people
including and American soldier killed.
Hillary's people manage to use Signal. I bet even Trumps crowd could
manage that. As always it is laziness that is the enemy of good crypto use.

Nonsense. Trump did not get the right info - he did not know how well
defended the site was. It was not a leak that made the attack fail it
was overly hasty action. Even Obama (the bomber) did not want to do that
action - he knew it as ill advised but the Chump was all go to do it not
knowing what was there on the ground - and it got a lot of people

I have a feeling that Internet Registrars and Cloudflare are doing this
for their own legal protection.
It's long established law that conspiracy to commit genocide, ethnic
cleansing and to violate the human rights of groups of people is a
crime. Creating the theoretical framework for genocide is also a crime
as was evidenced by the conviction of Julius Streicher who authored
Daily Stormer's predescessor Der Sturmer.
It's Cloudflare and Registrars protecting themselves from being
complicit in human rights crimes.

Yes - i am only speculating, but there are lawyers out there who have
brought up the possible charge. I spoke with one of them recently.
I am concerned about the market monopoly of DNS service ...but
This is not about speech. It is about people conspiring to commit
genocide, ethnic cleansing and to remove peoples human rights.
I am quoting law used in Neuremburg. ...The same law that was used to
convict Julius Streicher.
You cannot simultaneously enguage in free speech and a conspiracy to
commit genocide. One is permitted, one is a crime.
...Unless you want to redefine free speech to include criminal conspiracy.
We can oppose monopolies like DNS TLD without defending conspiracy to
commit genocide.

I do defend Free Speech - but when people start planning on murdering
whole groups of people it is no longer free speech. It's something else.
There is no need for Hate Speech laws. ...Just when things go to
plotting genocide, ethnic cleansing or removing the human rights of
large groups of people it's criminal. Of course the actual line needs to
be determined not by me but by a legitimate court.
Would you actually call the Neuremburg trials nutty lefty ? I think not.

Thankfully it is not significant numbers of people planning genocide. If
there were we would be in much more trouble than we are.
Groups like ironmarch, atomwaffen and many on Daily stormer certainly
appear to be planning genocide. One does not tag their publication "the
most genocidal republican website" if one is not interested in promoting
...But of course that will be for a judge to decide. Not me.
I'm not trying to get people excited. I'm just stating the legal fact
that conspiracy to commit genocide, ethnic cleansing and to deny human
rights is not free speech. It's a crime.
Nonsequitur. One dead is too many.

Not really. I am alarmed by the increasing number of people who have
gong to the extreme position of advocating wiping people out.
I am just hoping that the majority serves as a break on them.
And the issue is not numbers here.
No doubt at all.
If the internet was considered a public utility or something like that
free speech would be better protected, however planning crimes like
genocide would not be.
Probably the most dangerous are not publishing anything at all.
No - i am speculating about the possible liability of people knowingly
hosting sites planning genocide.
And if the desires of ironmarch were to come to fruition it would not be
minor at all. Thankfully they don't have much resources other than
"mother of satan" and old smoke detectors.
The reason i mentioned ironmarch and atomwaffen is that their members
have murdered people. Stormfront members have killed about 100 so far.
What i am arguing is that there IS quite possibly a crime occuring when
people use these sites to plan genocide. I'm not talking about idle
talk. I'm talking about stuff that goes towards planning.
I'm quite aware that this argument might lead to the prosecution of
Alberto Gonzales, John Yoo and possibly even Alan Dershowitz who have
created legal frameworks that could justify torture. Dersh came up with
the idea of "Torture warrents". In their case there might be a direct
connection with their frameworks and torture.
Though i would say - that maybe i should be pushing for enforcement
directly of the laws about conspiracy to commit genocide. (thinking)
Good discussion and lots for me to think about.

It's Cloudflare and Registrars protecting themselves from being
complicit in human rights crimes.

Yes - i am only speculating, but there are lawyers out there who have
brought up the possible charge. I spoke with one of them recently.
I am concerned about the market monopoly of DNS service ...but
This is not about speech. It is about people conspiring to commit
genocide, ethnic cleansing and to remove peoples human rights.
I am quoting law used in Neuremburg. ...The same law that was used to
convict Julius Streicher.
You cannot simultaneously enguage in free speech and a conspiracy to
commit genocide. One is permitted, one is a crime.
...Unless you want to redefine free speech to include criminal conspiracy.
We can oppose monopolies like DNS TLD without defending conspiracy to
commit genocide.

I do defend Free Speech - but when people start planning on murdering
whole groups of people it is no longer free speech. It's something else.
There is no need for Hate Speech laws. ...Just when things go to
plotting genocide, ethnic cleansing or removing the human rights of
large groups of people it's criminal. Of course the actual line needs to
be determined not by me but by a legitimate court.
Would you actually call the Neuremburg trials nutty lefty ? I think not.
It's mainstream actually rather conservative law.

Thankfully it is not significant numbers of people planning genocide. If
there were we would be in much more trouble than we are.
Groups like ironmarch, atomwaffen and many on Daily stormer certainly
appear to be planning genocide. One does not tag their publication "the
most genocidal republican website" if one is not interested in promoting
...But of course that will be for a judge to decide. Not me.
I'm not trying to get people excited. I'm just stating the legal fact
that conspiracy to commit genocide, ethnic cleansing and to deny human
rights is not free speech. It's a crime.
Nonsequitur. One dead is too many.

Not really. I am alarmed by the increasing number of people who have
gong to the extreme position of advocating wiping people out.
I am just hoping that the majority serves as a break on them.
And the issue is not numbers here.
No doubt at all.
If the internet was considered a public utility or something like that
free speech would be better protected, however planning crimes like
genocide would not be.
Probably the most dangerous are not publishing anything at all.
No - i am speculating about the possible liability of people knowingly
hosting sites planning genocide.
And if the desires of ironmarch were to come to fruition it would not be
minor at all. Thankfully they don't have much resources other than
"mother of satan" and old smoke detectors.
The reason i mentioned ironmarch and atomwaffen is that their members
have murdered people. Stormfront members have killed about 100 so far.
What i am arguing is that there IS quite possibly a crime occuring when
people use these sites to plan genocide. I'm not talking about idle
talk. I'm talking about stuff that goes towards planning.
I'm quite aware that this argument might lead to the prosecution of
Alberto Gonzales, John Yoo and possibly even Alan Dershowitz who have
created legal frameworks that could justify torture. Dersh came up with
the idea of "Torture warrents". In their case there might be a direct
connection with their frameworks and torture.
Though i would say - that maybe i should be pushing for enforcement
directly of the laws about conspiracy to commit genocide. (thinking)
Good discussion and lots for me to think about.

I tend to support voluntary associations except when they become
repressive and totalitarian. Heck, even homeowner associations sometimes
become repressive. ...which is why i live out in the sticks where you
don't even need a permit to build things.

That's kind of the key that both left libertarians and regular
libertarians are looking to do.
There are not set solutions. When a solution leads to a totalitarian
situation that is a sign that it is wrong.

For someone who supports freedom of travel and who opposes the
requirement of papers - what legitimate "job" does ICE do ?
Honestly, TSA and ICE just look like jobs programs to me. Jobs
programs to satisfy authoritarians.

I am not in support of borders and i support people's right to travel
without "Papers".
I grieved when Gilmore's right to travel case was decided against him.
I guess travelling through E Germany in 1973 made a pretty heavy
impression on me as a child.
If you say i am "Virtue Signaling" that would be hillarious.

Most libertarians are opposed to collectivism. The idea that a
neihborhood or country is privately owned by the members who then
can keep anyone out or kick people out can become rather nightmarish
form of collectivism.

We will see. I expect legally you are correct.
My bet is that the Supremes will vote the same
way as the bigot baker case and say they have to
provide service but NOT service that is in opposition
to their beliefs.

In the US that is probably true.
Note - i dislike ALL of these candidates and presidents but here is my
rundown on corruption of the last few presidents.
Nixon - moderately corrupt but he got caught
Carter - not very corrupt. The thing with his brother being the touch
   corruption.
Reagan - moderately corrupt
Ford - not effective enough to be corrupt
Bush I - moderately corrupt
Clinton - heavy corruption
Bush II - more corrupt that Bush I
Obama - not very corrupt but very authoritarian
   He did eventually get rid of Hillary
Trump - heavilly corrupt businessman
Hillary - probably more corrupt than Bill
Lets look at this with real events and try to figure it out.
Where i live out in the sticks of the Northeast it is pretty
corrupt. A town clerk actually pocketed over a million dollars
of tax payments in a small town. ...And so far she has gotten
away with it.

Razor - your ignorance about the state is showing.
There are a lot of appalachia-like areas in Vermont - particularly
in the Northeastern part of the state. I know quite a few people who
live without water.
Most of the state is not Stowe and even the picturesque towns with
pristine town centers are often a facade in front of people who don't
have enough money to eat.
Here is an article about how awful the schools are. This is NOT an
isolated incident.
Some of the very old black families are still around if you know where
to look, though the state is quite white. Some of the people listed as
white might not be if you scratch a bit. People who could pass as white
often did to avoid the eugenics campaigns leveled against the abenaki.
