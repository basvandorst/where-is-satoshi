No, no it wasn't.  Here's the report:
Take a minute to read it, I'll wait.  Pay particular attention to pages
11 and 12, where they define the severity classes.  Having a "Medium"
severity vulnerability means:
So when they state that there are no less than *four* vulnerabilities
that they found in this class, that is *far from quite good*.
Thankfully, three of them are classified as difficulty: high to exploit,
but the "Weak Volume Header key derivation algorithm" is only
difficulty: medium, which referring again to pages 11 and 12 is quite
