"I miss the Soviet Union, at least they respected the personal and social
freedom (but, yes, I know Stalin was a lunatic). "
I hope you don't really believe that.

Well, we still do have museums like Belarus / North Corea, I would
recommend a one-year survival there ;-)

@_subject: BlackHat2014: Deanonymize Tor for $3000 
In general what grarpamp said is true, however we should remember that I2P
(aka Invisible Internet Protocol) is designed to be "a real undernet" and
thus it is focused mostly on hidden services and invisible hosting. It
results in fact that there is much less outproxies than in TOR network.
Using I2P to acces a "standard" Internet but in anonymous way is much less
efficient than via TOR only because of that design issue, moreover I2P is
just less popular than TOR and has less participating nodes, what
additionally decreases it's efficiency.

@_subject: Gruveo, more secure skype alternative? 
Even if technicaly they're so anonymous and afe as they claim to be, they
won't be an alternative for skype without accounts and "friend lists" etc.
It is just to hard to use for "average user".
Imagine when every time when you would like to chat or call someone via
skype, instead of make a double click on his position on the list, you
would have to let him know you want to speak, agree code and wait till he
get to the website... its quite problematic.
