+1. Mr. Carroll's nonsensical wordsmithing has been awesome from day
one. Big ups indeed. Reminds me of the good old days of the complaint
letter generator. For those who don't know:

I guess inventing new math to break crypto has some physics problems.

Woah woah woah. When did the message go out about changing Tor to a "low
latency" network? High latency is the number one criticism of Tor from
In addition UDP traffic won't even pass through Tor. This results
in low-latency real time applications like VoIP impossible over that network
Perhaps the author is not aware of these properties of Internet protocols?

Sounds like we need new terms for a high latency network that is a low
latency network or a low latency network that is a high latency network?
Perhaps store-and-forward versus stateful?
