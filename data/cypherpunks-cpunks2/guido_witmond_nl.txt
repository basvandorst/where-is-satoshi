With an average of 5 important sites and 50 less important site per
person, it requires people to *remember* 55 totally different 20
character passwords.
The number of trivia that people can remember in short term memory is 7
plus or minus 2. 55 is way to much to remember.
The world needs to forget passwords as remote identification and move on
to client certificates. Preferably, a separate client certificate for
each site. It takes only a small browser plug in to make it easy.

What you've designed is a classic password manager application, like
Lastpass, Keepas. It's a good design for when the site requires a password.
However, as every website has their own rules for password, lengths,
allowed characters, it makes it a bit of hit and miss whether a certain
generated password will be accepted. It would lead to having a list of
sites and recipes of what is allowed. It doens't scale.
Besides, most sites also require an email address, so anonymity is lost.
Client certificates are already implemented in most web servers. It's a
one-line setting to accept a certain certificate authority for a site.
If that is the Ca of the site owner themselves, it's even easier.
The price to pay (for end users) is to have a computer that cannot
easily be subverted by malware. Notice that's the same requirement for
password managers.
I've written about my ideas on client certificates on my site:

Who is providing the javascript? The site? The NSA? Then it can send a
NIL-cipher that effectively transmits the single password in a
recoverable way to the server. It would be unnoticable to the user.
Don't assume people will do anything intelligent. Tehy won't! We should
protect people even when they try to do stupid things. Security and
privacy must be standard and be reliable to be trusted upon.
You hit the nail on the head. A reliable syncing agent provides the
seamless user experience and protects against a loss of a private key
(that's needed to prove ownership of the certificate).
Browsers that don't support this syncing will find themselves as
roadkill of the ubiquitous encryption age. They will adapt or die.

Bitcoin cannot stop corruption but it may make it harder to hide. Hence,
easier to detect.
My hope is that Bitcoin is transparent enough for action groups to
investigate and bring the dirty laundry into the sunlight.
My worry is that by using intermediate payment providers, this
transparency gets lost due to 'banking sectrets'.

Any direct transactions between bribers and bribees will be visible in
the blockchain. It forces politicians to get other mechanisms, such as
the public speaking arrangements like those of ex-presidents.
My worry is that the transparency of these 'banks' is one way only,
towards the despots. Not towards the people. Just like the problem with
SWIFT. My payment records get hauled to the US, what can I learn at
SWIFT of the US-payments? We needed a whistle blower to learn about the
black budget.
Most people don't regards money as power. They regard it as property.
That's why calls to 'vote with your wallet' are unsuccessful.
When we have transparent money, people will realise their power, and
learn of the consequences. It sucks when you cheat on your wife and the
whole world can find out about it.
It might also lead to more local currencies where a group of people have
the privacy of their group against the rest of the world. That certainly
diminishes the power of despots. Just like we can use cash to buy our
daily groceries.
These local currencies mustn't grow to be big banks, otherwise the

Quoted from a comment by user 'decrement' on techdirt [1]:
There is a bit of genius behind Geoffrey Stone's approach.
It is far too easy when being blasted by public and press opinion to
simply circle the wagons and ignore the criticism. To simply resist the
opposing viewpoint. To trivialize it.
What is the ideal result one can hope for going forward? In my opinion
that result looks like opening doors to tighten privacy laws and ending
some of these unfettered metadata collection activities.
By reinforcing to the employees at the NSA that they are doing a good
job, and protecting the country, then placing blame outside the NSA
George diffuses the personal nature of the argument. This allows
employees to be more receptive to the message, and plants the seed that
accepting change is not equated with a defeat.
In terms of realizing a true significant modification of these programs,
planting this seed is brilliant move. Continuing to water it may grow
additional support for these ideas from within. Splitting hairs by
demonizing the entire organization, as reprehensible as past actions
might be, is a certain way to maximize resistance.
I like the focus on "what is the desired outcome?" rather than
reactionary outrage.

Hi Dan,
I like your idea of comparing being spied upon to paying tax.
The similarities are striking:
Like tax, I prefer to pay the least amount.
Like tax, I can hire a professional that knows tax law inside out to
find the (legal) loopholes.
Like tax, it should be discussed in public.
Like tax, society should strive to minimize the tax-burden.
Like tax, we don't tax those to whom it doesn't apply.

@_subject: and not a single Tor hacker was surprised... 
Dear coderman,
Client certificates are part of my answer to MitM attacks.
The other part is to forget about third-party CA's.
The trick is to have each (web-)site sign the client certificates for
their own users. Users sign up for a site by creating a fresh
public/private keypair, invent an account name, and create a CSR
containing just that: the accountname and the public key.
The site's own Certificate Signer (local authority) checks to see if the
user's chosen account name is unique and if so signs the certificate and
returns it in the same response.
The site's web server is configured to only accept their own client
certificates signed by their own Signer. Each site only accepts their
own certificates.
In addition to that, the server sports a server-certificate that has
been signed by the site's Signer.
When the user connects to the site, the user agent first connects
without presenting any client certificates. Ie, anonymously. The agent
will then offer the user to log in at the site. But it only offers those
certificates that have been signed by the same local authority.
The client certificate becomes the identity of the client, while the
site's Certificate Signer Root Certificate becomes the identity of the site.
The MitM protection so far, is all-or-nothing. The user can only be
MitM'ed if Mallory sits in between all the time, right from the first
connection. However, there are several mitigation strategies.
The first mitigation strategy is for the site-owner to publish the
Site's Local Signer Root Certificate in the DNSSEC-record. I realise
that "true cypherpunks" don't like centralised systems but bear with me,
here it is part of the solution.
The user agent does a DNSSEC lookup, validates the signature tree up to
the pinned DNSSEC root key. This limits MitM attacks to those who have a
copy of that root key. ie, state level spooks.
This lookup needs only be done once, before the first connect.
The second mitigation strategy is an independent global append-only log
of created client certificates. Whenever a user agent receives a
certificate, it submits it to this global log. Every once in a while,
the agent queries the log for all certificates bearing the account name
that the user has chosen. There must be exactly one anser.
To improve security at first contact, the agent queries the log for the
expected value of the sites' Certificate Signer Root certificate. There
must be only one.
This list must be cryptographically protected against tampering. Ideally
it is a distributed, decentralised global effort. The downside of this
second approach, it needs to be designed, the DNSSEC-approach can be
used right now.
The combination of DNSSEC and the Log make it even more robust. The
DNSSEC effectively specifies the intentions of the site owner, the log
measures the reality. These two should match.
So far, I haven't mentioned Tor. When you use this protocol, you are
protected against spoiled onions. The exit nodes won't have access to
any site's private key, so they cannot fake a certificate that matches
the client certificates.
When an exit node creates a fake certificate for a site, the user agent
interprets that as either a new site, (and offering the user to create
an account). Or the user agent detects that the server certificate does
not match with the certificate that it has remembered for this site and
raises an alarm.
As users change Tor-exit-nodes regularly, there can't be a MitM at each
As every connection is encrypted and authenticated, Tor traffic does not
stand out from non-Tor traffic. Even if people use this protocol to
connect to facebook and spill their lives there, they are helping
activists to hide their traffic better.
Using this protocol, we can create an introduction-service that lets
total strangers exchange and validate each other's public keys. And from
there bootstrap other secure channels.
Coderman (and others), does this appeal to you?

Lurking at several cryptography mailing lists, gave me some hints :-)
1st. Although NULL encryption is a problem, I expect that most
crypto-toolkit developers will disable these in their default
configuration. From there it will bubble up the stack into the
distributions. That's a lesson that NSA has thought us: make defaults safe!
2nd. There is nothing in eccentric authentication that specifies one
branch of public key mathematics  over another. I deliberately leave the
choice of either RSA, EC, or others out. As I'm not a cryptographer, I
can't make that decision. I do specify what I expect the protocol needs
to accomplish. It's up to the experts to match the appropriate parts. My
prototype used RSA/TLS/DNSSEC
Not really. Each site signs only for itself. There is no need to trust
anything else than your own systems (Or the hoster who does the work for
you). That trust level is already needed for every current web site.
In fact, with a proper setup, the Root certificate's private key for the
site does not live at the server, for signing, it uses a subRoot.
Now when the site gets hacked, the hackers can create more accounts for
themselves or invalidate other peoples' accounts. But the attackers can
never impersonate any of the sites user accounts at other sites, as
these use their own signing key. I believe it is more safe than hashing
The more worrisome part are the end-users' computers. The Posix-model is
not designed to protect users against themselves. Although, every user
expects that to be the case. Things like microkernels, Capsicum,
Qubes-OS, Genode, Pola, least authority designs are in DIRE need.
DNSSEC might be just as difficult as IPsec, or its private key might
have already been leaked to NSA due to compromised hardware. We need to
have alternatives.
The eccentric-protocol can use other global unique naming schemes. The
requirements are: easy and cheap enough so every website can get a
unique and human memorize-able name. Namecoin might fit the
requirements, or GNS (GnuNet).
I hope this sparks the curiosity.

I hope this sparks the curiosity.

Plugging my ideas on client certificates once more:
I've come up with a way how to get away from passwords into the realm of
pseudonymous client certificates.
It uses the centralised DNSSEC structure to create decentralised,
zooko-squared names.
Each site signs the client certificates for it's own visitors. People
will acquire as many certificates as people have passwords nowadays.
Each certificate is an independent identity. A user agent takes care of
all these identities and the cryptography involved.
Other benefits: the user agents prevent MitM attacks, making the
spoiled-onions Tor problem a thing of the past.
The subversive part is that no site can prevent any two members from
communicating directly. Imagine two people using their faceboogle-signed
client-certificates to authenticate each other with OTR over XMPP using
With DNSSEC, it can be implemented right now. The DNSSEC part might be
replaced with a Namecoin or other central naming system when the need
I thought cypherpunks might appreciate a design like that, but I could
be mistaken.
