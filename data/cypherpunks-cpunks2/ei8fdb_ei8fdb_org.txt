@_subject: Safest exit country? 
Two parts:
1. Requirement: Minimise the possibility of surveillance at egress point.
Surveillance of the wire between my country X and the egress country Z is not a concern. (NB: It is a concern, but not taken into account in this thought experiment)
Question: If I was able to choose which country to route my IP traffic through and have act as my egress point to "the Internet public" which country would I choose?
2. Question: Is Iceland as safe as people think? Safe is defined as a location where surveillance and monitoring is minimal/non-existent.
My answer: No.

@_subject: is truecrypt dead? 
There is a thread on the twitters at the moment about this:
