Those three list Intel based notebooks only (not even a token AMD device).
 From the point of view of free firmware, all of them are unsuitable, since free (and open, and trustable) Intel firmware implementations are only available for museum class^W^Wlong-term support hardware.
I think the only x86 notebook with completely free firmware these days that can be bought easily is
(featuring those Intel museum chips)
And I guess doing something like that group is the only working approach for now: Pick some notebook (something recent), free its firmware, sell the pre-modded boxes (and publish numbers!).
If you manage to sell significant volumes (which shouldn't be all that large), that might turn some heads.
There are some issues with this approach: You're limited in your choice of base hardware (likely AMD/Via chipsets only, the EC must be manageable with reasonable effort) and it must be available for some time (no fun doing a port for 2 months, then selling the notebook for another 4, after which it's taken off the market, and you have to start from scratch).
And, of course, when doing this, you carry the usual entrepreneurial risk.
