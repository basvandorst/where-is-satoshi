Remember - did at least 3 of these, 20 years ago. :)
Still true - still valid - still good advice.
I avoid the scratching, but maybe also this helps.

Hasn't it been the case almost since day one of crypto wars to expect authorities to limit its use, adjusting prohibitions, warnings, dire threats, legislation as new means of crypto are deployed?
And "new" means are continually being developed, and many of them quickly expropriated by contracts with authorities.
Coders and developers switch sides from being poor to be rather well to do. Quite a few cypherpunks have followed this path, and why not "get real," with aging, families, debts and envy of the success of those who switch sides, get bought out, sign up for lucrative speaking fees, promulgate reasons for being cooperative rather than Is there any currently popular crypto/comsec/infosec product not subject to this "go along to get along?"
Cybersecurity coupld with cyberfailure are fantastic cash cows, golden gooses, gold rushes. Assange has reportedly become a millionaire twice over, and a large portion of that is assumed to be laundered official money, as tax write-off or simply dirty.
But that is the industry standard of security in all it versions. Keep it secret, blow theats and safety at consumers and citizenry.
Smartest cybersecurity developers are working for totalizing "smart" to every spot on online and on earth, in every head and home. While preaching privacy protection with latest porous prophylactics, once called backdoors, confessionals, prayers, trust in deity. Now called upgrades and sure-fire, ever better, ways to excuse failure, maintain faith in a reputation in a brand.
Built-in failure by the most trusted, surely not that. Send conributions here to keep up the fight.
And don't ever go off on your own, experts must review your shit for golden nuggets. Do expose your best to conferences, believe in open source review, seek investors, crowd-fund, stay fucked.
