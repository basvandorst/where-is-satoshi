@_subject: Tim May's Passing Confirmed 
I've been a lurker off and on this list since around 1997 (maybe 1998), under different incarnations, and this is probably the first time I've ever said anything here.
I just wanted to say Tim May was, for me, one of the most memorable people on the list. A lot brilliant. A little crazy. And sometimes hilariously funny (intentional or not)
RIP Tim May. :(
