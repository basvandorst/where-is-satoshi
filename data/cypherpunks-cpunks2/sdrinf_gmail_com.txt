*"Various hurdles are preventing wide-spread adoption of PGP encrypted
communication, with easy searchability being one of them. I propose a
standard allowing users to search through encrypted email safely. The
search is tailored for text messages containing distinct words. Searching
is achieved through a search index in plain-text attached to each email.
The index contains each of the unique words contained in a message, salt
hashed. There will be 10-50 salts per email account used randomly on a per
word basis. Larger amount of salts mean more safety and more expensive
search. Incoming messages will also get appended with a search index using
IMAP APPEND command. ..."*

I suspect Tomas' original concern was regarding lack of ongoing support; as
we've all seen, things are moving at a fast peace in security, which might
open it open to vulnerabilities down the line.
I welcome all, and any alternatives, or forks.
