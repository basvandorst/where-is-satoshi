NSA Director Mike Rogers spoke at Stanford University's Hoover
Institute this past weekend, and a faculty member asked him what the
NSA is doing with regards to personnel security to stop another
incident like Edward Snowden's release of classified documents.
Interestingly, the first and primary measure that the NSA director

The NSA director mentioned other personnel security measures that he

Last year, I heard from a U.S. Navy SIGINTer that when he reported for

personal ISP. The polygraph operator confronted him about having
visited AntiPolygraph.org and then set about trying to discredit the
information we provide.
This person said they'd provide further details later in the day, but
never wrote back and did not respond to repeated follow-up inquiries:
