@_subject: What is consensus? 
You are incorrect, sir.
Similar to 'consentire':
'con' - a variant of 'com' meaning 'with'
'sentire' - a variant of 'sēnsus' meaning 'to feel'
Literally 'with sense' or 'in agreement'.
To join in "agreement" is to express what is essentially a vote.  Hence
the term "Vote with your wallet", which I am sure many anon here do.
All art is political; everything is art.

You faggot.
Using electricity isn't going to "destroy" the planet.  Do you even know
what energy is? Or how the flat earth spins?
