In my mind the sudden appearance of that momentarily almost-famous
"pole dancer girlfriend" of Snowden's is of a piece with the rest
of The Snowden Affair:  It raises more questions than it answers,
and adds more reasons to suspect a double game.
Did the "pole dancer girlfriend" ever exist, and is that really
her?  I will assume so, for the sake of a fun story.  What are the
odds that she has travelled more than one mile in any direction
since Ed went walkabout, without that motion being logged for
analysis by a consortium of TLAs?  Other than "she has always
worked for us and is still passing polygraph exams," how could her
bona fides as a person of no interest be so confidently endorsed
by the public servants who let her walk away?  If on the other
hand Russia worked some hocus pocus on her behalf, why have public
officials and partisan propaganda mills that already call Snowden
a Russian agent remained silent on that subject?
Painting the young lady in question as a Russian agent who used
her pole dancing skills to steal U.S. secrets would not be hard:
The story sells itself.  Part two of the story would be how she
fluttered away free as a bird to the waiting welcome of her
Russian paymasters:  First Benghazi, now Boris and Natasha in a
Moscow love nest?  It's an outrageous story that would suit many
of our partisan political propagandists very nicely right about...
now.  But all I hear so far is crickets.
"Those whom heaven helps we call the sons of heaven. They do not
learn this by learning. They do not work it by working. They do
not reason it by using reason. To let understanding stop at what
cannot be understood is a high attainment. Those who cannot do it
will be destroyed on the lathe of heaven." -- Ursula K. LeGuin

This, for starters:
Questions raised by anomalies and inconsistencies present in the
original reports of The Snowden Affair and the PRISM documents
have not been resolved.
We have not physically met any of the players in this game; all we
have to go on is propaganda, that is, stories created for the
purpose of persuading us to adopt certain beliefs and
perspectives.  Propaganda is not necessarily a bad thing, nor does
it always indicate deception:  But to take the story presented at
face value and proceed as if one has positive knowledge of the
events depicted is at best a hazardous approach:  Particularly
when a story originates inside agencies whose stock in trade
includes deception and manipulation of friend and foe as routine
daily missions.
My take on The Snowden Affair is deliberately contrarian.  Every
press outlet in the world takes the story at face value and
questions nothing about its basic premises; the only permissible
disagreement is whether one should be "for or against" Ed Snowden.
Jumping on either bandwagon contributes nothing.  In this
situation, the more inconvenient a question is to the basic
premise of the story, the more valuable it may be to our
understanding of the substance and meaning of the story.
I never insinuated that Snowden "could not have had a girlfriend."
 What I have said is that the absence of any indications of a
particular girlfriend other than three words spoken by Ed Snowden,
raised the question of whether that particular person did exist.
Now we do have fairly persuasive evidence of her existence, to
integrate into our interpretation of The Snowden Saga - if we
remain interested enough to bother.
In The Snowden Saga, Lindsay initially existed only as three words
spoken by Ed Snowden when describing the way of life he sacrificed
to undertake his heroic quest:  "Pole dancer girlfriend."  The
appearance of a person named Lindsay in the new film, along with
the story that he met her in a bar in Japan and that she followed
him to Hawaii, is the first corroborating evidence that this
person ever existed.  Now she appears as the most influential
person in Ed's life during the time frame when he decided to
abandon his entire way of life and become a fugitive facing life
in prison for the sake of a Holy Quest.
Questioning whether Ed Snowden was really a free agent, vs. an
unwitting agent exploited by a U.S. (or other) intelligence
operation, is obviously out of bounds.  So that's what I do.
To date, nothing that well informed members of the public did not
already know or confidently guess about the capabilities and
activities of the NSA has been revealed by any of the releases
attributed to Snowden.  I also see that every supposedly
controversial legal or policy issue raised by The Snowden Affair
was already settled in the intelligence community's favor, in
Courts and Congress, years earlier:  The most genuinely
controversial document released was the first one, an order
demanding Verizon's call records; that was a fight the
intelligence community was well prepared to win and they did so
Anyone who studies the history and current activities of the
intelligence community learns early on that final answers are very
elusive.  Insiders describe the intelligence world as a
"wilderness of mirrors."  Elaborate and long-running deceptions
are business as usual:  Familiar examples include the complete
British control of German intelligence networks in England during
World War II, Soviet placement and maintenance of high level
double agents inside the CIA during the first Cold War, and
numerous false flag operations by everybody, such as Israel's
failed Lavon Affair.  Observers inside the intelligence services
are little better off than those on the outside when it comes to
getting the straight story:  Histories created for internal
consumption by outfits like the CIA routinely gloss over
controversies and endorse falsehoods.
In today's world it is not possible to stop leakers from leaking.
But it is very possible to create controlled leakers of one's
own, and use them to pull public attention away from the genuine
article, saturate relevant press resources, and keep legal and
legislative overseers busy chasing after one's own chosen
allegations and indiscretions.  If Ed Snowden did not exist, it
would be necessary to create him.
I have no reason to believe that Ed Snowden is anything other than
what he appears to be:  An idealist who has been used as a means
to an end.  This leaves the question, used by whom and for what
ends?  One can choose a side to take and adjust one's beliefs
accordingly, or leave questions that do not yet have answers open.
That is why I thought the LeGuin quote was very appropriate in
the present context:
"Those whom heaven helps we call the sons of heaven. They do not
learn this by learning. They do not work it by working. They do
not reason it by using reason. To let understanding stop at what

Why such a suspicious attitide?  :o)
This loops back to my own initial interpretation of the Snowden
affair as a likely deception operation.  Since then my opinion of
that interpretation has been all over the map in response to new
information, but I have never had reason to doubt that the Snowden
leaks are controlled for the benefit of the U.S. National
Interest.  (Material from the second and/or third NSA leakers,
believed to be stationed in Germany, maybe not quite so much.)
Some of my speculations here are obsolete, but the general concept
that the Snowden Saga is not what it appears to be and is strongly
influenced and/or controlled by elements of the NatSec community
appears to stand up well.  I believe it's very possible that
Snowden never obtained access to the useful and relevant technical
documents that seem to be missing from his dump:

Historically, the FBI has used keyloggers to defeat PGP Disc and
Truecrypt - and also, I am sure, other encrypted file systems that
don't have back door access as a standard feature.
Since rubber hose cryptanalysis and bugging computers are well
known FBI methods, while world + dog have failed so far to make
real progress on breaking the ciphers used in Truecrypt, I see no
reason to suspect the latter occurred.  None at all.
The word "Truecrypt" does not appear in this summary of expert
testimony, which describes forensics conducted at the facilities
the classified files were borrowed from:
So, the defendant was already in the bag before somebody managed
to type the correct pass phrase and examine the contents of his
stash.  I found no indication of whether his guilty plea came
before or after investigators had access to the encrypted data; it
seems very likely that handing over the pass phrase was part of a
plea deal.
Persuading people that a cryptographic tool does not work is a
very effective attack against it.  Should we blame ignorance or
something else for the "Truecrypt is broken" take-away many casual
readers will pick up from this story as written?

My thoughts exactly:  Snowden never left the reservation when he
collected his docs, except in that he copied quite a lot of them
and carried them out.  Reading up on what your internal customers
use the network for is healthy and encouraged behavior for admins
- - up to the point of "sensitive sources and methods."
Ah yup.
Project scopes, code names, and functional descriptions give one a
high level but fairly definitive picture of the systems described.
 Once one knows what they are doing, the how is largely self
explanatory.  The only surprise in the whole Snowden dump is the
scope and depth of U.S. engagement in cyber-spying:  Going from
well founded suspicion to detailed documentary evidence is a
quantum leap, converting knowledge into intelligence.
The extent of Greenwald & Co. cooperation with State authorities,
vs. purely commercial motives, remains an open question.
It may be a coincidence that the first two Big Stories of the
Snowden Saga broke on the same days as the last two major events
in the Manning trial.  Greenwald knocked Chelsea's story right off
the public's radar.  I do believe in coincidences, but I try not
to bet on them, and this one casts a creepy, PsyOps kind of light
on the Snowden business.  The sale of those documents to Pierre
Omidyar also seems a little creepy to me:
One content gap that I find puzzling is the absence of references
in published Snowden docs to what was formerly called Romas/COIN
then Odyssey, a system revealed by the H.B. Gary e-mail dump.
Maybe I missed a description of that program under another name: I
have not been reading everything that comes down the pipe.
Romas/COIN was the name of Uncle Sam's cellular network, smart
phone and social media surveillance and exploitation toolkit from
Hell (see echelon2.org). As a rich source of high quality
collection in regions vital to the National Interest, I am sure
that the NSA taps into this kit's databases and/or work products,
even if it "belongs to" another Service.  Maybe somebody here
recognizes Romas/COIN as somthing appearing under another name in
Snowden docs?

Really unpopular people could anonymously crowdfund actions

Global observer attacks can be augmented by owning a substantial
number of the routers:  All hosted at one facility, but globally
distributed via transparent VPN connections running on a variety
of platforms all over the world. These router instances would be
somewhat customized to facilitate manipulation of traffic via a
purpose built hypervisor with a plugin architecture for monitor
functions. Since code names aren't supposed to be related to the
named thing in any way, we can't call this Hydra.
In terms of real world threats, I think it's safe to say that TOR
"Hidden Services" aren't very well hidden from motivated
adversaries who can deploy global observation and/or global
infiltration attacks: The persistence, fixed physical location and
interactive availability a hidden services makes it a fat, dumb,
happy sitting target for any major State's military and police

To convince router manufacturers that they must transition to
TOR-by-default routers is a tall order:  That's a big commercial
market with a small number of dominant players, inherently aligned
with conservative a.k.a. Fascist interests.
Global many-to-many communications is correctly perceived as a
threat to the political and economic dominance of State and
Corporate institutions, formerly assured by central control of
mass scale communications for censorship and propaganda purposes.
 In this context, mass surveillance is an adaptive response that
seeks to counter-balance the "liberating" impact of the Internet
by enabling early identification and effective manipulation of
emergent mass movements and ad hoc leadership cadres.
TOR is a weapon; the U.S. State Department funds it to support the
destabilizing impact of counter-censorship and
counter-surveillance technology on other, more overtly repressive
regimes.  However, high profile busts of Hidden Service users
indicate that TOR is not quite effective enough to defeat U.S.
network surveillance assets, at least not where fixed high-value
targets are concerned.  This is consistent with U.S. policy
objectives with regard to the strength of all cryptographic
We are told that the TOR Project favors convenience and speed over
security, because this is necessary to build a large enough user
base to make the system effective.  That does not entirely make
sense, as favoring security over speed and convenience would make
the system effective regardless of the size of its user base.  It
makes more sense to imagine that the TOR Project would lose its
Federal funding and become a target for effective harassment and
manipulation by Federal security services, if TOR's security was
upgraded to be resistant to U.S. surveillance capabilities.
"Everybody knows" that effective resistance to traffic analysis of
an encrypted low-latency anonymizing network requires a constant
flow of traffic, padded as necessary with dummy packets to
maintain a constant through-put when an endpoint is idle.  This
deprives observers of the ability to match the endpoints of any
given session by analyzing the timing and number of packets at
entry and exit nodes.
But nobody implements effective cover traffic:  The reasons given
for this deficiency include concerns about bandwidth limitations
and processor overhead. 20 years ago these barriers were real,
today not so much.  I2P users have the option of hosting enough
torrents to keep cover traffic unrelated to their other uses of
that network going; this is not as effective as padding traffic to
maintain a uniform flow, but way better than no cover traffic.
TOR actively discourages file sharing, "because" this would cause
bandwidth and processor overhead problems.
I believe it would be much easier to persuade the TOR Project to
implement cover traffic, or to create a next generation TOR
network that does, than to persuade router makers to support
today's other than best practices TOR network by default.  But I'm
not sure that this can be done by any project based in a U.S.
controlled jurisdiction, as it would be contrary to the National

To convince router manufacturers that they must transition to
TOR-by-default routers is a tall order:  That's a big commercial
market with a small number of dominant players, inherently aligned
with conservative a.k.a. Fascist interests.
Global many-to-many communications is correctly perceived as a
threat to the political and economic dominance of State and
Corporate institutions, formerly assured by central control of
mass scale communications for censorship and propaganda purposes.
 In this context, mass surveillance is an adaptive response that
seeks to counter-balance the "liberating" impact of the Internet
by enabling early identification and effective manipulation of
emergent mass movements and ad hoc leadership cadres.
TOR is a weapon; the U.S. State Department funds it to support the
destabilizing impact of counter-censorship and
counter-surveillance technology on other, more overtly repressive
regimes.  However, high profile busts of Hidden Service users
indicate that TOR is not quite effective enough to defeat U.S.
network surveillance assets, at least not where fixed high-value
targets are concerned.  This is consistent with U.S. policy
objectives with regard to the strength of all cryptographic
We are told that the TOR Project favors convenience and speed over
security, because this is necessary to build a large enough user
base to make the system effective.  That does not entirely make
sense, as favoring security over speed and convenience would make
the system effective regardless of the size of its user base.  It
makes more sense to imagine that the TOR Project would lose its
Federal funding and become a target for effective harassment and
manipulation by Federal security services, if TOR's security was
upgraded to be resistant to U.S. surveillance capabilities.
"Everybody knows" that effective resistance to traffic analysis of
an encrypted low-latency anonymizing network requires a constant
flow of traffic, padded as necessary with dummy packets to
maintain a constant through-put when an endpoint is idle.  This
deprives observers of the ability to match the endpoints of any
given session by analyzing the timing and number of packets at
entry and exit nodes.
But nobody implements effective cover traffic:  The reasons given
for this deficiency include concerns about bandwidth limitations
and processor overhead. 20 years ago these barriers were real,
today not so much.  I2P users have the option of hosting enough
torrents to keep cover traffic unrelated to their other uses of
that network going; this is not as effective as padding traffic to
maintain a uniform flow, but way better than no cover traffic.
TOR actively discourages file sharing, "because" this would cause
bandwidth and processor overhead problems.
I believe it would be much easier to persuade the TOR Project to
implement cover traffic, or to create a next generation TOR
network that does, than to persuade router makers to support
today's other than best practices TOR network by default.  But I'm
not sure that this can be done by any project based in a U.S.
controlled jurisdiction, as it would be contrary to the National

"Kafkatrapping" a.k.a. guilt tripping by advocates of various
social and economic reform agendas is a losing strategy.  Among
naive followers attracted to activist causes, it encourages
contempt and hostility toward audiences they must reach and
influence in order to achieve their movement's goals.  Guilt
tripping may persuade some weak minded outsiders to submissively
fall in line with the movement's agenda, but reliably alienates
opinion leaders and non-aligned activists whose support is
necessary for the movement's growth and success.  Effective
activist leaders focus on building mutually supportive
relationships with their audiences; paid infiltrators, careerists
and volunteer egomaniacs focus on dividing their audiences into
mutually hostile armed camps.
Guilt tripping is elitism.  It makes the ignorant conformist
follower feel superior, at the cost of alienating key audiences
whose support is essential for the movement's success.
The grievances of reform movements are always objections to the
abuse of power by those who have it.  Those who have power want to
keep it, and they are well positioned to employ political warfare
assets including helpful State Security services and the Public
Relations industry.  Their clandestine operators work to degrade
reform movement messaging, divide reform movement supporters, and
turn as much of the general public as possible against reform
movements.  Broadcast media outlets work to assure that the most
divisive messaging from a "movement" reaches the general public
first and loudest.  Consistent, persistent guilt trip messaging
from a reform movement reliably indicates the presence and
influence of actors inside the movement who are opposed to the
movement's stated objectives.
Effective political activists do not use or tolerate guilt
tripping, simply because it is counter productive.  Blanket
personal condemnation of one's fellow humans can and should be
called out whenever seen, on the basis that it is both factually
wrong and strategically "less than useless."

Well yeah, he's only stating the obvious:  Pervasive networked
computing is here, it's growing, and historical concepts of
'privacy' are just that, historical.  But in the context of the

something that exists naturally and is violated when State actors
pry into the private affairs of individuals.  That's a narrow
viewpoint, distorted by an increasingly irrelevant context.
Today, State actors are only one group of "privacy violators,"
alongside commercial interests and the general public itself.  The
disadvantages of a world with little or no privacy are
counterbalanced by significant advantages that are inherent in a
world of "networked everything."
The Panopticon is a prison where the guards can watch the inmates
but the inmates can not watch the guards.  The Internet is a

CPunks will recall Cryptome's ongoing Eyeball series, and of
course, the Total Poindexter Awareness project:  Early examples of
open source intelligence collection /and/ reporting directed
against the wardens of our modern Panopticon.  Today, projects
like CopWatch are "watching the watchers" and reporting to an
audience large enough to inconvenience our Panopticon's owners.
In the last few days we have seen random nobodies manage to save
and re-publish multiple eyewitness accounts of a staged
'terrorist' attack, directly contradicting the propaganda
narrative the event was staged to support.
The availability of more and better political intelligence
formerly concealed from the public is growing exponentially.  This
is one of several drivers of fundamental change in large scale
power relationships that is causing a panic among our present
rulers.  The United States is preparing to put down major civil
uprisings inside its own borders, again in full view of interested
members of the general public.
I sometimes compare paranoid reactions to the "loss of privacy" in
the networked world to mental telepathy:  The prospect of someone
reading your mind is frightening, until it turns out that your own
deeply held secrets are not special or unusual to a telepath who
has already "seen it all" and has /far/ worse examples to compare
your most heinous and embarrassing inner thoughts and motivations
Old Farts have major problems wrapping their heads around the
concept that a world where privacy is shrinking fast and expected
to nearly disappear is a Good Thing.  People who grew up with the

The power to give and withhold permission for others to see you
varies with circumstances.  In an environment where this power is
inherently weak or intermittent, you are "in the game" whether you
want to be or not; the only alternative is to isolate yourself
from resources native to the privacy-hostile environment.  Most of
the participants in the privacy-hostile networked world consider
the resources found there indispensable.
However, to whatever extent you participate in an environment
where arbitrary enforcement of personal decisions about "privacy"
is often impossible, a purely defensive game is most likely a long
term losing strategy for society at large:  The practical
advantages of participating in the networked world far outweigh
the perceived and, possibly, the actual harm from "loss of
privacy."  Only a few atypical individuals will be able to manage

they happened to take an unnatural interest in computers.  So a
large faction among them are capable of understanding and

disclosures of their activities and data to 3rd parties.

A highly productive "office worker's desk" that fits in a small

Public Intelligence, one's news aggregators of choice, access to
foreign press outlets, various spook watching sites, the mass of

The Internet is billions of people, interacting through the
world's first many-to-many communications medium.  The "Web 2.0"
buzzword denotes a real thing:  Millions of users as content
creators and content promoters, the appearance (as predicted) of
swarming behaviors on the networks with social and economic

Yes it will.  But will that be a sufficient advantage to
compensate for the ones our rulers lost when the Internet became
too important to commerce to "just turn it off"?  Little Brother
is watching Them, and there are enough /clever/ Little Brothers
(and Sisters) out there looking to pull Big Brother's pants down
that they are becoming a real world problem.
Yes, it gives the opposition a potentially useful tool.  As there
are FAR too many dissidents of various types wandering around
loose for it to be possible to personally persecute more than a
tiny fraction of them, the main value of mass surveillance is for
aggregate content analysis, social network mapping, and predictive
modelling of large scale social behavior.  This may be useful for
targeting and calibration of propaganda, and advance deployment of
physical assets to counter populist political actions.  But so
far, Big Brother seems to suck at that kind of work...
Do the new surveillance capabilities the Internet gives military
and police agencies outweigh the educational, intelligence,
propaganda and organizational capabilities the Internet has given
to radicals of all stripes?  That remains to be seen, but I am
fairly sure that obsessive attention to "privacy" shifts the
balance of power somewhat toward those whose whole job is to
maintain the status quo.
Of course, any political organizer with any common sense knows
well enough when to keep some specific information OFF the

ordered to disperse then immediately tear gassed.  That wasn't the
"hot story" covered by the press corps, however.
Mass media news outlets reported rioting:  USA Today used the
headline "Ferguson Burning."  But that didn't happen.  The only
"civil disturbance" was the CW attack on the crowd downtown.
The material events referenced by the propaganda narrative were
consistent with one or two mobile teams armed with molotovs and
M-80 firecrackers leading the TV cameras on a merry chase away
from the crowd downtown by simulating gunfire and setting fires:
The isolated fires were not associated with disorderly crowds or
looting. There were numerous reports of gunfire but no injuries or
reports of people seen carrying guns or shooting.  The biggest
fires were at an auto parts store, and a used car dealership where
a row of cars were burned (the owner presumably got the full
insured value of some stock that wasn't moving).  One police car
apparently burned for over an hour, as if prepared in advance to
do so in case it took longer than expected for TV news crews to
In this instance, it is very possible that network surveillance
enabled our Security Services to determine in advance that there
would be a large crowd that night, at a well organized
self-policing event unlikely to produce violence or property
damage useful to the State's propaganda mission.  Anyone could
have predicted the crowd, but its orderly behavior was not a
likely guess unless the organizers and associated social
networking traffic were under surveillance.

I'll bite.  Just a couple of questions for starters:  They call
for speculation, but that seems to be OK in our present context
since the position they challenge is itself based on speculation.
How is it possible that the Soviet Union did not detect and expose
the moon landing hoaxes (there were six successful Apollo missions
to the Moon)?
How is it possible that simulating the Apollo missions could be
less expensive, or in any other way more desirable, than actually
doing them?
How is it possible that /no/ credible evidence that the Apollo
program was a hoax has surfaced by now?  All I have seen is
speculation, elevated to "evidence" in the eyes of some beholders
by confirmation bias.
Example:  No dust on the faceplate in a very famous photo of an
astronaut on the moon.  This widely distributed "proof" of a moon
landing hoax falls flat when placed in its native context:  The
propaganda extravaganza around the Apollo program produced and
published /lots/ of high quality graphics.  Time Magazine used all
the photos they really liked, without referencing which were taken
in training environments vs. on the Moon OR hesitating to
extensively retouch the "real" pictures for maximum artistic quality

Give people roles to play in an inherently violent system, and
whoever those people are, they will begin to do violence.  That's
a general case that scales all the way up to what happens when
"honest" politicians are given a representational democracy to run.
The best part about the Milgram experiments was that a significant
number of volunteers dropped out early.  Pity it's a bit late to
send them anarchist literature and encourage them to turn out for
public events.  :D
I was thinking more along the lines of "rebel as you are told,"
the oldest scam in the book.  As a general case, the most
productive way for a well entrenched ruling class to attack people
who dislike authority figures is to provide them with models of
rebellion that do not work:  Mass market propaganda to the rescue.
That was never my intention.  I just have a strong aversion to the
'sheeple' paradigm, which I do consider a core component of "rebel
as you are told" propaganda.
I have had occasional success.  The key concept is to avoid trying
to move people all the way from their current position to the one
you would prefer them to have at one go.  Tailor the message to
the audience and try to move them ONE step in the direction you
want to see them move.  Of course, don't neglect to preach to the
choir:  How else will they be able to get on the same page and put
on a decent show?
I have been pushing this packet of books for around a year now,
and from time to time it seems to have been well received:  It's a
course in remedial politics, intended to fill basic gaps in
people's information about how populist a.k.a. anarchist politics
actually works:
The presumption that people who are notably compliant with
illegitimate  authority have a "conscience" and fixed notions of
right and wrong is questionable.  Those who comply most eagerly
include sociopathic personalities and people who are all to easily
led due to other disorders.
The "60% to 90%" cover a spectrum from grudging, minimal
compliance to elaborate and even competitive compliance, typically
related to the degree that their individual income and social
status benefit from a show of compliance.  But as the gap between
rewards promised and rewards delivered continues to widen, and the
violent excesses of our rulers become more and more obvious,
compliance will continue to decline.  This creates a growth market
for populist political agitators - a market that opponents and
supporters of authoritarian rule are already competing to capture.
Politics is about power:  Who has it, who doesn't, and how these
groups interact.  The object of political activity is to obtain
and exercise power, toward whatever ends one chooses.  Political
models and strategies that actually work in this context are
"correct" while those that do not work are "incorrect."  There is
a time and place for everything, but rarely a time when elitism,
or driving wedges between groups who have political enemies in
common with oneself, is "correct" in a functional sense.

Indeed they do.  In a context where the test subjects are
self-selected (volunteers) from a population and culture deeply
committed to elaborate, labor intensive submission to authority
(college students), with "the boss" hovering over them demanding
compliance (politely of course), most will continue "only
following orders" to the point of endangering the lives of
anonymous strangers.
I'm not sure this generalizes to describe the behavior of whole
populations in the wild, though.  Certainly, every country of any
size has more than enough pathological "followers" to field
military forces, run concentration camps, etc.  But I think "60%
to 90%" of any population is a very high estimate.
Nope:  I was expressly talking about "Those who comply most
eagerly", not the much larger number whose compliance is marginal,
grudging, or largely pretended.
You'll get no arguments from me on that point:  If I could find a
way to put that on a paying basis, I would probably not be flat
broke today.
Major clue:  The most persistent and effective populist resistance
movements have emerged from religious communities.  Our
adversaries understand this well, and spare no expense promoting
atheism to the demographic groups most likely to engage in
political activism.
Terminally corrupt, easily bought clergy - a minority among that
occupation - are kept front and center in public view by mass
media outlets, for the dual purpose of alienating as many 'natural
born rebels' as possible from religion in general, and recruiting
as many 'natural born killers' as possible into a "God and
Country" eg. God IS Country cult paradigm.
More obvious to the general public:  As an example consider the
unprecedented mass media coverage of violent crimes by police
officers, and social network propaganda campaigns like those run
by Black Lives Matter, Cop Watch, etc.
Likewise, Liberals and Conservatives are acutely aware of mass
scale economic crimes by our rulers:  The Liberals are taught to
blame Capitalism and the Conservatives to blame Socialism.  The
real perpetrators are billionaires who use Capitalist or Socialist
models where and as they provide maximum advantage; as long as the
general public fails to recognize this the game can continue - but
no matter what, the looting of national economies and attendant
reductions in the rewards of obedience continues.
I have not proposed violent excesses, I have observed them.  Big
History:  Satyagraha, Civil Rights, People Power and the Zapatista
movement never happened?  The Dutch did not bring Nazification of
their country to a grinding halt, and Iceland is still controlled
by a gang of criminal bankers?
As rationalizations go, imagining State and Corporate actors to be
all-powerful and civil society weak and helpless, is a GREAT
excuse for personal non-action.  That's why State aligned actors
consistently present these Big Lies as Eternal Truths.
An angry fighter is a losing fighter.  Things that are not "OK"
are in fact explainable, and if your explanations accurately model
the causes of Bad Things, they will enable you to develop
effective strategies for reducing or eliminating those Bad Things.
We have all been taught that Bad Things are done by Bad People,
and that the universal solution is to identify, hate, and destroy
those Bad People.  We are taught this by propagandists employed by
Bad People, so that our responses to the bad things they do will
be self defeating.  The same naive beliefs are essential for
promoting wars of economic conquest, where people must be
persuaded that certain foreign leaders are Bad People who must be
hated and destroyed.
As for removing the promised rewards of full compliance with
illegitimate authority, that is a self-solving problem if one
waits long enough.  Right now in the former Western Democracies,
those rewards are being removed by the ruling class, via wholesale
looting of national economies at the fastest pace that will not
cause them to immediately collapse.
This looting is necessary to sustain the exponential growth of
corporate enterprise, which is necessary to its own survival and
to the financial ambitions of our billionaires:  The exponential
growth of the global industrial economy has reached hard limits
imposed by geophysics; the only way to keep our billionaires'
portfolios growing is redistribution of wealth from the poor and
middle classes to the very rich.
What I mean by "this" requires the context of the paragraph the
sentence above has been removed from:  "This" is the growing gap
between rewards promised and rewards delivered, in return for
committed compliance with the demands of illegitimate authority.
You might say that I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.

My position is that holding oneself to be inherently superior to

hissy fit.  You will find a simple statement about my dislike for
the term 'sheeple'.

It does approach that.  One of the proofs offered by Beleivers is
that it is impossible for human beings to pass through the Van

1969 and later, actually.  :D
Not my field, but I do know that ham radio operators using /very/
directional high gain antennas followed the missions from Earth
orbit to the surface of the Moon, listening to and recording voice
and telemetry signals.  The cost of sending transmitters to the
Moon, and maintaining a constant stream of 100% believable signals
all the way there and back, would have been quite staggering.  The
odds of this unlikely mission failing would have approached 100%
over the course of six missions.
Cheaper to build and launch a series of Saturn V launch vehicles
with LEMs and command modules on top, than to just go ahead and
send them all the way?  At minimum it would cost the same as doing
the program for real.
Also consider that part of the price of simulating an Apollo
program would have been the cost of maintaining the illusion from
beginning to end, under the watchful eyes of thousands of
engineers who thoroughly understood the systems they were working
on, documented everything they did in minute detail, and
distributed  that documentation to other equally well informed
engineers working on related systems?  It would have cost much
more to fake the program than to actually do it.
Not to mention the 100% risk of exposure, since /one/ error in the
deception would have resulted in a chain reaction leaving the
whole deception exposed to dozens, then hundreds, then thousands
of very smart, very committed, very pissed off people.  Even the
Soviets could not have kept a lid on something like that.

"Kafkatrapping" a.k.a. guilt tripping by advocates of various
social and economic reform agendas is a losing strategy.  Among
naive followers attracted to activist causes, it encourages
contempt and hostility toward audiences they must reach and
influence in order to achieve their movement's goals.  Guilt
tripping may persuade some weak minded outsiders to submissively
fall in line with the movement's agenda, but reliably alienates
opinion leaders and non-aligned activists whose support is
necessary for the movement's growth and success.  Effective
activist leaders focus on building mutually supportive
relationships with their audiences; paid infiltrators, careerists
and volunteer egomaniacs focus on dividing their audiences into
mutually hostile armed camps.
Guilt tripping is elitism.  It makes the ignorant conformist
follower feel superior, at the cost of alienating key audiences
whose support is essential for the movement's success.
The grievances of reform movements are always objections to the
abuse of power by those who have it.  Those who have power want to
keep it, and they are well positioned to employ political warfare
assets including helpful State Security services and the Public
Relations industry.  Their clandestine operators work to degrade
reform movement messaging, divide reform movement supporters, and
turn as much of the general public as possible against reform
movements.  Broadcast media outlets work to assure that the most
divisive messaging from a "movement" reaches the general public
first and loudest.  Consistent, persistent guilt trip messaging
from a reform movement reliably indicates the presence and
influence of actors inside the movement who are opposed to the
movement's stated objectives.
Effective political activists do not use or tolerate guilt
tripping, simply because it is counter productive.  Blanket
personal condemnation of one's fellow humans can and should be
called out whenever seen, on the basis that it is both factually
wrong and strategically "less than useless."

Well yeah, he's only stating the obvious:  Pervasive networked
computing is here, it's growing, and historical concepts of
'privacy' are just that, historical.  But in the context of the

something that exists naturally and is violated when State actors
pry into the private affairs of individuals.  That's a narrow
viewpoint, distorted by an increasingly irrelevant context.
Today, State actors are only one group of "privacy violators,"
alongside commercial interests and the general public itself.  The
disadvantages of a world with little or no privacy are
counterbalanced by significant advantages that are inherent in a
world of "networked everything."

In the last few days we have seen random nobodies manage to save

narrative the event was staged to support.
The availability of more and better political intelligence
formerly concealed from the public is growing exponentially.  This
is one of several drivers of fundamental change in large scale
power relationships that is causing a panic among our present
rulers.  The United States is preparing to put down major civil
uprisings inside its own borders, again in full view of interested
members of the general public.
I sometimes compare paranoid reactions to the "loss of privacy" in
the networked world to mental telepathy:  The prospect of someone

deeply held secrets are not special or unusual to a telepath who
has already "seen it all" and has /far/ worse examples to compare

The power to give and withhold permission for others to see you
varies with circumstances.  In an environment where this power is
inherently weak or intermittent, you are "in the game" whether you
want to be or not; the only alternative is to isolate yourself
from resources native to the privacy-hostile environment.  Most of
the participants in the privacy-hostile networked world consider
the resources found there indispensable.
However, to whatever extent you participate in an environment
where arbitrary enforcement of personal decisions about "privacy"
is often impossible, a purely defensive game is most likely a long
term losing strategy for society at large:  The practical
advantages of participating in the networked world far outweigh
the perceived and, possibly, the actual harm from "loss of

are FAR too many dissidents of various types wandering around
loose for it to be possible to personally persecute more than a
tiny fraction of them, the main value of mass surveillance is for
aggregate content analysis, social network mapping, and predictive
modelling of large scale social behavior.  This may be useful for

I don't think network surveillance had much to do with it, but in
terms of political warfare 'on the field', I believe I have seen
examples recently.  Example:
When the grand jury verdict clearing the cop who shot Michael
Brown was announced, there was a very large but orderly

When I see or hear the word 'sheeple' I think about how successful
our adversaries have been in dividing the people they prey on into
mutually hostile factions, each of which blames the actions of
their common enemy on the others.  Populist and reformist politics
ends and mindless compliance begins when people decide that they
are categorically superior to those who don't happen to belong to
their own gang, and start speaking and acting on that basis.

Give people roles to play in an inherently violent system, and
whoever those people are, they will begin to do violence.  That's
a general case that scales all the way up to what happens when
"honest" politicians are given a representational democracy to run.
The best part about the Milgram experiments was that a significant
number of volunteers dropped out early.  Pity it's a bit late to
send them anarchist literature and encourage them to turn out for
public events.  :D
I was thinking more along the lines of "rebel as you are told,"
the oldest scam in the book.  As a general case, the most
productive way for a well entrenched ruling class to attack people
who dislike authority figures is to provide them with models of
rebellion that do not work:  Mass market propaganda to the rescue.
That was never my intention.  I just have a strong aversion to the
'sheeple' paradigm, which I do consider a core component of "rebel
as you are told" propaganda.
I have had occasional success.  The key concept is to avoid trying
to move people all the way from their current position to the one
you would prefer them to have at one go.  Tailor the message to
the audience and try to move them ONE step in the direction you
want to see them move.  Of course, don't neglect to preach to the
choir:  How else will they be able to get on the same page and put
on a decent show?
I have been pushing this packet of books for around a year now,
and from time to time it seems to have been well received:  It's a
course in remedial politics, intended to fill basic gaps in
people's information about how populist a.k.a. anarchist politics
actually works:
The presumption that people who are notably compliant with
illegitimate  authority have a "conscience" and fixed notions of
right and wrong is questionable.  Those who comply most eagerly
include sociopathic personalities and people who are all to easily
led due to other disorders.
The "60% to 90%" cover a spectrum from grudging, minimal
compliance to elaborate and even competitive compliance, typically
related to the degree that their individual income and social
status benefit from a show of compliance.  But as the gap between
rewards promised and rewards delivered continues to widen, and the
violent excesses of our rulers become more and more obvious,
compliance will continue to decline.  This creates a growth market
for populist political agitators - a market that opponents and
supporters of authoritarian rule are already competing to capture.
Politics is about power:  Who has it, who doesn't, and how these
groups interact.  The object of political activity is to obtain
and exercise power, toward whatever ends one chooses.  Political
models and strategies that actually work in this context are
"correct" while those that do not work are "incorrect."  There is
a time and place for everything, but rarely a time when elitism,
or driving wedges between groups who have political enemies in
common with oneself, is "correct" in a functional sense.

Indeed they do.  In a context where the test subjects are
self-selected (volunteers) from a population and culture deeply
committed to elaborate, labor intensive submission to authority
(college students), with "the boss" hovering over them demanding
compliance (politely of course), most will continue "only
following orders" to the point of endangering the lives of
anonymous strangers.
I'm not sure this generalizes to describe the behavior of whole
populations in the wild, though.  Certainly, every country of any
size has more than enough pathological "followers" to field
military forces, run concentration camps, etc.  But I think "60%
to 90%" of any population is a very high estimate.
Nope:  I was expressly talking about "Those who comply most
eagerly", not the much larger number whose compliance is marginal,
grudging, or largely pretended.
You'll get no arguments from me on that point:  If I could find a
way to put that on a paying basis, I would probably not be flat
broke today.
Major clue:  The most persistent and effective populist resistance
movements have emerged from religious communities.  Our
adversaries understand this well, and spare no expense promoting
atheism to the demographic groups most likely to engage in
political activism.
Terminally corrupt, easily bought clergy - a minority among that
occupation - are kept front and center in public view by mass
media outlets, for the dual purpose of alienating as many 'natural
born rebels' as possible from religion in general, and recruiting
as many 'natural born killers' as possible into a "God and
Country" eg. God IS Country cult paradigm.
More obvious to the general public:  As an example consider the
unprecedented mass media coverage of violent crimes by police
officers, and social network propaganda campaigns like those run
by Black Lives Matter, Cop Watch, etc.
Likewise, Liberals and Conservatives are acutely aware of mass
scale economic crimes by our rulers:  The Liberals are taught to
blame Capitalism and the Conservatives to blame Socialism.  The
real perpetrators are billionaires who use Capitalist or Socialist
models where and as they provide maximum advantage; as long as the
general public fails to recognize this the game can continue - but
no matter what, the looting of national economies and attendant
reductions in the rewards of obedience continues.
I have not proposed violent excesses, I have observed them.  Big
History:  Satyagraha, Civil Rights, People Power and the Zapatista
movement never happened?  The Dutch did not bring Nazification of
their country to a grinding halt, and Iceland is still controlled
by a gang of criminal bankers?
As rationalizations go, imagining State and Corporate actors to be
all-powerful and civil society weak and helpless, is a GREAT
excuse for personal non-action.  That's why State aligned actors
consistently present these Big Lies as Eternal Truths.
An angry fighter is a losing fighter.  Things that are not "OK"
are in fact explainable, and if your explanations accurately model
the causes of Bad Things, they will enable you to develop
effective strategies for reducing or eliminating those Bad Things.
We have all been taught that Bad Things are done by Bad People,
and that the universal solution is to identify, hate, and destroy
those Bad People.  We are taught this by propagandists employed by
Bad People, so that our responses to the bad things they do will
be self defeating.  The same naive beliefs are essential for
promoting wars of economic conquest, where people must be
persuaded that certain foreign leaders are Bad People who must be
hated and destroyed.
As for removing the promised rewards of full compliance with
illegitimate authority, that is a self-solving problem if one
waits long enough.  Right now in the former Western Democracies,
those rewards are being removed by the ruling class, via wholesale
looting of national economies at the fastest pace that will not
cause them to immediately collapse.
This looting is necessary to sustain the exponential growth of
corporate enterprise, which is necessary to its own survival and
to the financial ambitions of our billionaires:  The exponential
growth of the global industrial economy has reached hard limits
imposed by geophysics; the only way to keep our billionaires'
portfolios growing is redistribution of wealth from the poor and
middle classes to the very rich.
What I mean by "this" requires the context of the paragraph the
sentence above has been removed from:  "This" is the growing gap
between rewards promised and rewards delivered, in return for
committed compliance with the demands of illegitimate authority.
You might say that I'm a dreamer, but I'm not the only one.
Power creates authority.  Authority is the exercise of expressly
defined power.
Something "works" when it has the desired effect in practical
I'm a think I wandered into Monty Python's Argument Clinic.  The
best I can hope for is to avoid 'being hit in the head lessons.'
I hate to say it, but yes.  Example:
Bear in mind that she was a volunteer.  She could have stood down
at any moment.
My position is that holding oneself to be inherently superior to
most of the human race is elitist.
If you refer to my first post in this thread, you won't find a
hissy fit.  You will find a simple statement about my dislike for
the term 'sheeple'.
Ooh, I'm gonna get it now!  :D
Sure, as long as we are clear that the entity making that
statement is a human.  Personally, I imagine that humans in
general, and you in particular, are much more than that.

It does approach that.  One of the proofs offered by Beleivers is
that it is impossible for human beings to pass through the Van
Allen belts and live.  Because they have been called "radiation"

Not my field, but I do know that ham radio operators using /very/
directional high gain antennas followed the missions from Earth
orbit to the surface of the Moon, listening to and recording voice
and telemetry signals.  The cost of sending transmitters to the
Moon, and maintaining a constant stream of 100% believable signals
all the way there and back, would have been quite staggering.  The
odds of this unlikely mission failing would have approached 100%
over the course of six missions.
Cheaper to build and launch a series of Saturn V launch vehicles
with LEMs and command modules on top, than to just go ahead and
send them all the way?  At minimum it would cost the same as doing
the program for real.
Also consider that part of the price of simulating an Apollo
program would have been the cost of maintaining the illusion from
beginning to end, under the watchful eyes of thousands of
engineers who thoroughly understood the systems they were working
on, documented everything they did in minute detail, and
distributed  that documentation to other equally well informed
engineers working on related systems?  It would have cost much
more to fake the program than to actually do it.
Not to mention the 100% risk of exposure, since /one/ error in the
deception would have resulted in a chain reaction leaving the
whole deception exposed to dozens, then hundreds, then thousands
of very smart, very committed, very pissed off people.  Even the
Soviets could not have kept a lid on something like that.

"Kafkatrapping" a.k.a. guilt tripping by advocates of various
social and economic reform agendas is a losing strategy.  Among
naive followers attracted to activist causes, it encourages
contempt and hostility toward audiences they must reach and
influence in order to achieve their movement's goals.  Guilt
tripping may persuade some weak minded outsiders to submissively
fall in line with the movement's agenda, but reliably alienates
opinion leaders and non-aligned activists whose support is
necessary for the movement's growth and success.  Effective
activist leaders focus on building mutually supportive
relationships with their audiences; paid infiltrators, careerists
and volunteer egomaniacs focus on dividing their audiences into
mutually hostile armed camps.
Guilt tripping is elitism.  It makes the ignorant conformist
follower feel superior, at the cost of alienating key audiences
whose support is essential for the movement's success.
The grievances of reform movements are always objections to the
abuse of power by those who have it.  Those who have power want to
keep it, and they are well positioned to employ political warfare
assets including helpful State Security services and the Public
Relations industry.  Their clandestine operators work to degrade
reform movement messaging, divide reform movement supporters, and
turn as much of the general public as possible against reform
movements.  Broadcast media outlets work to assure that the most
divisive messaging from a "movement" reaches the general public
first and loudest.  Consistent, persistent guilt trip messaging
from a reform movement reliably indicates the presence and
influence of actors inside the movement who are opposed to the
movement's stated objectives.
Effective political activists do not use or tolerate guilt
tripping, simply because it is counter productive.  Blanket
personal condemnation of one's fellow humans can and should be
called out whenever seen, on the basis that it is both factually
wrong and strategically "less than useless."

Well yeah, he's only stating the obvious:  Pervasive networked
computing is here, it's growing, and historical concepts of
'privacy' are just that, historical.  But in the context of the
show, his comments focus on the archaic paradigm of "privacy" as
something that exists naturally and is violated when State actors
pry into the private affairs of individuals.  That's a narrow
viewpoint, distorted by an increasingly irrelevant context.
Today, State actors are only one group of "privacy violators,"
alongside commercial interests and the general public itself.  The
disadvantages of a world with little or no privacy are
counterbalanced by significant advantages that are inherent in a
world of "networked everything."
The Panopticon is a prison where the guards can watch the inmates
but the inmates can not watch the guards.  The Internet is a
prison where the inmates can watch each other, and the guards:
The guards do have a better view, but their powers of observation
are no longer exclusive.
Secrets that could once be kept until after their exposure could
make no difference are now breaking open before the protected
operations are completed:
CPunks will recall Cryptome's ongoing Eyeball series, and of
course, the Total Poindexter Awareness project:  Early examples of
open source intelligence collection /and/ reporting directed
against the wardens of our modern Panopticon.  Today, projects
like CopWatch are "watching the watchers" and reporting to an
audience large enough to inconvenience our Panopticon's owners.
In the last few days we have seen random nobodies manage to save
and re-publish multiple eyewitness accounts of a staged
'terrorist' attack, directly contradicting the propaganda
narrative the event was staged to support.
The availability of more and better political intelligence
formerly concealed from the public is growing exponentially.  This
is one of several drivers of fundamental change in large scale
power relationships that is causing a panic among our present
rulers.  The United States is preparing to put down major civil
uprisings inside its own borders, again in full view of interested
members of the general public.
I sometimes compare paranoid reactions to the "loss of privacy" in
the networked world to mental telepathy:  The prospect of someone
reading your mind is frightening, until it turns out that your own
deeply held secrets are not special or unusual to a telepath who
has already "seen it all" and has /far/ worse examples to compare
your most heinous and embarrassing inner thoughts and motivations
Old Farts have major problems wrapping their heads around the
concept that a world where privacy is shrinking fast and expected
to nearly disappear is a Good Thing.  People who grew up with the

The power to give and withhold permission for others to see you
varies with circumstances.  In an environment where this power is
inherently weak or intermittent, you are "in the game" whether you
want to be or not; the only alternative is to isolate yourself
from resources native to the privacy-hostile environment.  Most of
the participants in the privacy-hostile networked world consider
the resources found there indispensable.
However, to whatever extent you participate in an environment
where arbitrary enforcement of personal decisions about "privacy"
is often impossible, a purely defensive game is most likely a long
term losing strategy for society at large:  The practical
advantages of participating in the networked world far outweigh
the perceived and, possibly, the actual harm from "loss of
privacy."  Only a few atypical individuals will be able to manage
their affairs so that the advantages of "strong privacy
protections" outweigh the costs of compensating for lost access to

Tell me about it:  Those Old Farts were early adopters, because
they happened to take an unnatural interest in computers.  So a

implementing network security and making rational decisions about
disclosures of their activities and data to 3rd parties.

Yes, it gives the opposition a potentially useful tool.  As there
are FAR too many dissidents of various types wandering around
loose for it to be possible to personally persecute more than a
tiny fraction of them, the main value of mass surveillance is for
aggregate content analysis, social network mapping, and predictive
modelling of large scale social behavior.  This may be useful for
targeting and calibration of propaganda, and advance deployment of
physical assets to counter populist political actions.  But so
far, Big Brother seems to suck at that kind of work...
Do the new surveillance capabilities the Internet gives military
and police agencies outweigh the educational, intelligence,
propaganda and organizational capabilities the Internet has given
to radicals of all stripes?  That remains to be seen, but I am
fairly sure that obsessive attention to "privacy" shifts the
balance of power somewhat toward those whose whole job is to
maintain the status quo.

I don't think network surveillance had much to do with it, but in
terms of political warfare 'on the field', I believe I have seen
examples recently.  Example:
When the grand jury verdict clearing the cop who shot Michael
Brown was announced, there was a very large but orderly
demonstration in downtown Ferguson.  We know this because people
who were present posted photos and videos as it happened.
According to realtime reports posted from the scene, crowd was
ordered to disperse then immediately tear gassed.  That wasn't the
"hot story" covered by the press corps, however.
Mass media news outlets reported rioting:  USA Today used the
headline "Ferguson Burning."  But that didn't happen.  The only
"civil disturbance" was the CW attack on the crowd downtown.
The material events referenced by the propaganda narrative were
consistent with one or two mobile teams armed with molotovs and
M-80 firecrackers leading the TV cameras on a merry chase away
from the crowd downtown by simulating gunfire and setting fires:
The isolated fires were not associated with disorderly crowds or
looting. There were numerous reports of gunfire but no injuries or
reports of people seen carrying guns or shooting.  The biggest
fires were at an auto parts store, and a used car dealership where
a row of cars were burned (the owner presumably got the full
insured value of some stock that wasn't moving).  One police car
apparently burned for over an hour, as if prepared in advance to
do so in case it took longer than expected for TV news crews to
In this instance, it is very possible that network surveillance
enabled our Security Services to determine in advance that there
would be a large crowd that night, at a well organized
self-policing event unlikely to produce violence or property
damage useful to the State's propaganda mission.  Anyone could
have predicted the crowd, but its orderly behavior was not a
likely guess unless the organizers and associated social
networking traffic were under surveillance.

Collection of metadata sufficient to reconstruct all of the above

How is it possible that the Soviet Union did not detect and expose

less expensive, or in any other way more desirable, than actually
doing them?
How is it possible that /no/ credible evidence that the Apollo

speculation, elevated to "evidence" in the eyes of some beholders
by confirmation bias.

committed to elaborate, labor intensive submission to authority
(college students), with "the boss" hovering over them demanding
compliance (politely of course), most will continue "only
following orders" to the point of endangering the lives of
anonymous strangers.
I'm not sure this generalizes to describe the behavior of whole
populations in the wild, though.  Certainly, every country of any
size has more than enough pathological "followers" to field
military forces, run concentration camps, etc.  But I think "60%
to 90%" of any population is a very high estimate.
Nope:  I was expressly talking about "Those who comply most
eagerly", not the much larger number whose compliance is marginal,
grudging, or largely pretended.
You'll get no arguments from me on that point:  If I could find a
way to put that on a paying basis, I would probably not be flat
broke today.
Major clue:  The most persistent and effective populist resistance
movements have emerged from religious communities.  Our
adversaries understand this well, and spare no expense promoting
atheism to the demographic groups most likely to engage in
political activism.
Terminally corrupt, easily bought clergy - a minority among that
occupation - are kept front and center in public view by mass
media outlets, for the dual purpose of alienating as many 'natural
born rebels' as possible from religion in general, and recruiting
as many 'natural born killers' as possible into a "God and
Country" eg. God IS Country cult paradigm.
More obvious to the general public:  As an example consider the
unprecedented mass media coverage of violent crimes by police
officers, and social network propaganda campaigns like those run
by Black Lives Matter, Cop Watch, etc.
Likewise, Liberals and Conservatives are acutely aware of mass
scale economic crimes by our rulers:  The Liberals are taught to
blame Capitalism and the Conservatives to blame Socialism.  The
real perpetrators are billionaires who use Capitalist or Socialist
models where and as they provide maximum advantage; as long as the
general public fails to recognize this the game can continue - but
no matter what, the looting of national economies and attendant
reductions in the rewards of obedience continues.
I have not proposed violent excesses, I have observed them.  Big
History:  Satyagraha, Civil Rights, People Power and the Zapatista
movement never happened?  The Dutch did not bring Nazification of
their country to a grinding halt, and Iceland is still controlled

As rationalizations go, imagining State and Corporate actors to be
all-powerful and civil society weak and helpless, is a GREAT
excuse for personal non-action.  That's why State aligned actors
consistently present these Big Lies as Eternal Truths.
An angry fighter is a losing fighter.  Things that are not "OK"
are in fact explainable, and if your explanations accurately model
the causes of Bad Things, they will enable you to develop
effective strategies for reducing or eliminating those Bad Things.
We have all been taught that Bad Things are done by Bad People,
and that the universal solution is to identify, hate, and destroy
those Bad People.  We are taught this by propagandists employed by
Bad People, so that our responses to the bad things they do will
be self defeating.  The same naive beliefs are essential for
promoting wars of economic conquest, where people must be
persuaded that certain foreign leaders are Bad People who must be
hated and destroyed.
As for removing the promised rewards of full compliance with
illegitimate authority, that is a self-solving problem if one
waits long enough.  Right now in the former Western Democracies,
those rewards are being removed by the ruling class, via wholesale
looting of national economies at the fastest pace that will not
cause them to immediately collapse.
This looting is necessary to sustain the exponential growth of
corporate enterprise, which is necessary to its own survival and
to the financial ambitions of our billionaires:  The exponential
growth of the global industrial economy has reached hard limits
imposed by geophysics; the only way to keep our billionaires'
portfolios growing is redistribution of wealth from the poor and
middle classes to the very rich.

between rewards promised and rewards delivered, in return for
committed compliance with the demands of illegitimate authority.

Not my field, but I do know that ham radio operators using /very/

orbit to the surface of the Moon, listening to and recording voice

all the way there and back, would have been quite staggering.  The
odds of this unlikely mission failing would have approached 100%
over the course of six missions.
Cheaper to build and launch a series of Saturn V launch vehicles
with LEMs and command modules on top, than to just go ahead and
send them all the way?  At minimum it would cost the same as doing
the program for real.
Also consider that part of the price of simulating an Apollo
program would have been the cost of maintaining the illusion from
beginning to end, under the watchful eyes of thousands of
engineers who thoroughly understood the systems they were working
on, documented everything they did in minute detail, and
distributed  that documentation to other equally well informed
engineers working on related systems?  It would have cost much
more to fake the program than to actually do it.
Not to mention the 100% risk of exposure, since /one/ error in the
deception would have resulted in a chain reaction leaving the
whole deception exposed to dozens, then hundreds, then thousands
of very smart, very committed, very pissed off people.  Even the

And all along I thought, the sooner the Pentagon et al stood down
and let the world be overrun, the better for the human race.
Better in every measurable way, except for the net worth and
sovereign power of the wealthy and powerful gangs that sponsor and
direct those organizations.
Last I heard, police forces were not dispatched to cross borders
and kill large numbers of people, to advance the financial agendas
of some few thousands of the folks back home.  When the police do
what the military does, they become criminals even by the
definition of the laws enacted by their own masters.
Anyone who deliberately and for personal gain participates in mass
murder might be considered "bad."  I prefer to think of them as
ignorant and disinformed, aside from a minority among them who are
psychopathic and in need of minders.
So...  If I understand this correctly, the CIA, a clandestine U.S.
military service, is in the business of persuading Presidents,
elected to embody the will of the People, to their way of
thinking.  Come to think of it, their charter implicity says so.
I guess we should have dumped them when we had the chance.  IIRC a
President once said he was going do just that, too bad somebody
shot him.
Every corporate entity needs intelligence to function.  How many
need a department to promote, codify and implement torture as a
psychological weapon?  How many need a department that arms,
trains and directs gangs of killers to put inconvenient market
competitors out of business, and take over their shops?  How many
need a department to set up and run major drug smuggling
operations, to fund other violent criminal enterprises off the books
I try not to go around calling people "scumbags" and come to think
of it, I succeed.  But there's no denying that working for the CIA
in any capacity imparts a certain taint, given that it has been a
criminal enterprise more or less since its inception and shows no
signs of meaningful reform.  By "criminal" I mean, per any common
sense definition that does not duck the issue by asserting that
certain functions of State are by definition "above the law" due
to some existential necessity.  A MAFIA bookkeeper who always does
an honest day's work and never hurts anybody is not a criminal, righ
Practical alternatives to endemic, high dollar institutional
violence are limited by the inherent nature of the institutions
that carry it out:  They exist to impose the will of their masters
on whole societies.  They defeat their masters' specified enemies
by any means necessary, which covers a spectrum from propaganda
through deception, bribery and terrorism to the industrialized
mass murder we call warfare.  Try to stop them; if you show signs
of success, their masters will direct them to neutralize YOU by
any means necessary.
As things stand, we don't have enough volunteers to shut down the
killing machine by direct intervention.  If and when we do, the
emergent organizations that make it possible will also play key
roles in developing long term solutions for international conflicts.
As a practical matter, one must do what one can to stop the
bleeding; such efforts tend to be contagious, and we have ways of
spreading that contagion.  It starts with telling the truth.
Opportunities to do that keep coming faster and faster.
Most people don't know what government is, because those who
govern use a very different definition than the ones the governed
are taught:  State sovereignty is the power to rob, kidnap and
kill withing a given territorial boundary, and to defend these
powers as one's exclusive prerogative.
Anarchists are consistently depicted as violent lunatics opposed
to any form of social order.  The idea that government is based on
the consent of the governed is all well and good in a civics
class, but God forbid someone should try to actually implement
that fine theory by withdrawing their consent from particular
incarnations and/or functions of government.
I would not say so, but broadly speaking, they are directed by
political appointees who, to varying extents, run them as criminal
enterprises.  Criminal, even by the very liberal and tolerant
standards set by the State that employs them.
To me, the alternatives are painfully obvious.  Step one in a real
"war against terror" is to stop doing terrorism.  Step one in
defending a country's "way of life" is to invest in its human and
industrial infrastructure.  It certainly makes no sense to indulge
in multi-trillion dollar tax and debt funded economic bonfires
that produce nothing but paychecks, stock dividends and the odd
few million dead bodies and refugees here and there.
That's kind of like advertising oneself as the kindest, most
considerate serial killer presently at large.
It doesn't take a lifetime of study or exceptional brain power to
recognize gross offenses to the values that define human beings as
social animals fit to walk the Earth.  It does take a lifetime of
study and exceptional brain power, on the part of a whole
managerial class, to direct that society to commit such offenses
and take them for granted as regrettable necessities.
The survival value of human intelligence has not been
satisfactorily demonstrated.  Its hazards are becoming more
obvious every day.

Any bench tech with access to publicly available documentation -
and the physical hardware - should be able to identify the RF
components in any automotive control system without too much
trouble.  ECM units are fairly well RF isolated, so those that
talk to the world should normally have easily identified
connections to external antennas.  High frequency transceiver
components usually have their own RF shielded areas on the board
as well.  Cutting one wire or IC pin per unit (antenna or IC
power) should isolate it from remote access.  If necessary
functions fail, undo the mod and try elsewhere until the desired
results are obtained.
In the U.S., getting hold of ECMs to play with presents some
inconveniences:  Junk yards pull ECMs and sell them back to their
manufacturers - some nonsense about "intellectual property" seems
to be involved - so there aren't many available on the open market
to play with.  But where there's a will, a few dollars and a small
pile of pointy tools, there's a way.

a market is willing to pay enough to support and grow the
project, it can be done.  Are there potential partners and large
scale consumers for "top security through total transparency" to
make an open hardware project viable today?
One potential route would be to broker a deal to pool the
resources of specialty hardware integrators who already have a
market base for high security "solutions."  The Open Office
project pulled off something similar years ago, obtaining major
funding and support from IBM and others who wanted Microsoft out
of their hair.  So, who wants a shot at defending some of their
digital assets from outfits like NSA and GHCQ, badly enough to pay
for it?
The first place I would start shopping this "crypto anarchist"
project around would be State security services - pretty much any
small to mid-sized outfit not in BRICS or FVEYE could be a
potential market for auditable scrambler phones for military
commanders, senior elected officials, diplomatic corps and
double-nought spies.  From there to high performance servers and
workstations would be a natural progression.
I haven't looked at how the Black Phone folks are doing lately,
but that looks like the kind of product line where open hardware
might find its first viable home.
Another consideration:  One needs not necessarily own the facility
where the chips are made:  ISO quality assurance programs already
in place support client access for audit and validation.  A
contract that specifies the client's intrusive presence during
every phase of production and handling would cost extra, but a QA
process that assumes the presence of hostile actors on the shop
floor is definitely possible.  Such a process would also be needed
at a dedicated facility:  One must assume the presence of hostile
actors there, too.

conventional production facilities.

That's exactly what I'm talking about:  Essentially taking over
the production process and working alongside facility staff, with
particular attention to choke points where validation is both
possible and productive.  ISO quality programs include provision
for onsite participation by clients; it's more a question of
money, and picking a facility that can readily accommodate the
requirements, than of getting anyone to open up any closed
process.  This might deprive one of the advantages of "commercial
trade secret" techniques belonging to the facility's owners, but
that's kind of the whole point of the exercise.  Smaller
facilities with older equipment would be better prospects than the
One should never be certain that one is receiving exactly what was
specified, regardless of validaiton.  Somewhere, the rising curve
of security costs will cross a falling curve of security risks,
and that's as good a place as any to draw a line.  Mark the other
side of the line "here be dragons - maybe."  End users can pick up
any perceived slack if and as they want to spend the money to do so.
Damn straight.  I'm especially picky about the inspection records
of nuclear power facilities; IMO they should include video of the
inspectors at work, especially in hazardous / PITA locations they
might be inclined to skip.  I recall at least one case where
reactor inspection logs were casually falsified for years, very
nearly causing a catastrophic core breach due to undetected
containment vessel deterioration located "around a corner and out

That's not what I have in mind at all.  Everything that touches
the production process would have to be isolated and audited.  In
practical terms, that would mean bringing the computers in
question in from offsite, with relevant software already installed
and validated.
In the context at hand, watching the whole thing play out would
consist of directing the whole process one step at a time, per a
procedure created in collaboration with the contractor's
engineering and QA departments.  Optical masks and/or equivalent
data files would be handled by client personnel and retained for
validation.  The chips that pop out would be under very stringent
property control, and quite a lot of them would be torn down and
thoroughly analyzed "at home" to validate the run.
Just like doing it at an existing commercial facility, with the
added advantage of much better control of physical access,
hardware, etc. at the dedicated facility. Whether that advantage
would be worth the extra costs, vs. real security improvements,
depends on how reliable the post-production tear down and analysis
of end product components is considered.  "A difference that makes
no difference is no difference."
If it really is impossible to build a trusted CPU with an
untrusted CPU, then it is not possible to build a trusted CPU.
Fortunately, trust is not an absolute and there are ways to build
relatively trustworthy systems from relatively untrustworthy
components.  A quote to the effect of "I do not care who votes, I
only care who counts the votes" comes to mind but I'm too lazy to
look it up right now.
I think that in the engineering and business worlds, trust is
always a point on a cost curve.
When Trust and Security are considered as absolutes, the costs of
maintaining them rise exponentially until the protected assets die
of resource starvation.  Civilization as we know it is presently
following the path of demanding absolute security, provided by
rulers vested with absolute trust, to early termination.  Getting
more on the practical business of making IC chips into the public
domain and widely distributed, enabling faster and decentralized
recovery of today's industrial capabilities, is one of the
benefits of open hardware development projects.
The objectives of an open IC project include providing protections
against institutional sabotage, but also the creation of
protocols, documents and data that can be re-used and improved
over time.  Policies and protocols necessary to assure adequate
transparency, including repeatability, would amount to enlarging
the GPL ecosystem to encompass computer hardware as well as
software.  If such a project can't produce products that are cost
effective for end users, it will remain at most a theme park ride
for misguided investors.  The "high security" angle looks like a
place where potential customers and nearly off-the-shelf
capabilities meet.

To me, the alternatives are painfully obvious.  Step one in a real
"war against terror" is to stop doing terrorism.  Step one in
defending a country's "way of life" is to invest in its human and
industrial infrastructure.  It certainly makes no sense to indulge
in multi-trillion dollar tax and debt funded economic bonfires
that produce nothing but paychecks, stock dividends and the odd
few million dead bodies and refugees here and there.
That's kind of like advertising oneself as the kindest, most

Any bench tech with access to publicly available documentation -
and the physical hardware - should be able to identify the RF
components in any automotive control system without too much
trouble.  ECM units are fairly well RF isolated, so those that
talk to the world should normally have easily identified
connections to external antennas.  High frequency transceiver
components usually have their own RF shielded areas on the board
as well.  Cutting one wire or IC pin per unit (antenna or IC
power) should isolate it from remote access.  If necessary
functions fail, undo the mod and try elsewhere until the desired
results are obtained.
In the U.S., getting hold of ECMs to play with presents some
inconveniences:  Junk yards pull ECMs and sell them back to their
manufacturers - some nonsense about "intellectual property" seems
to be involved - so there aren't many available on the open market
to play with.  But where there's a will, a few dollars and a small
pile of pointy tools, there's a way.

a market is willing to pay enough to support and grow the
project, it can be done.  Are there potential partners and large
scale consumers for "top security through total transparency" to
make an open hardware project viable today?
One potential route would be to broker a deal to pool the
resources of specialty hardware integrators who already have a
market base for high security "solutions."  The Open Office
project pulled off something similar years ago, obtaining major
funding and support from IBM and others who wanted Microsoft out
of their hair.  So, who wants a shot at defending some of their
digital assets from outfits like NSA and GHCQ, badly enough to pay
for it?
The first place I would start shopping this "crypto anarchist"
project around would be State security services - pretty much any
small to mid-sized outfit not in BRICS or FVEYE could be a
potential market for auditable scrambler phones for military
commanders, senior elected officials, diplomatic corps and
double-nought spies.  From there to high performance servers and
workstations would be a natural progression.
I haven't looked at how the Black Phone folks are doing lately,
but that looks like the kind of product line where open hardware
might find its first viable home.
Another consideration:  One needs not necessarily own the facility
where the chips are made:  ISO quality assurance programs already
in place support client access for audit and validation.  A
contract that specifies the client's intrusive presence during
every phase of production and handling would cost extra, but a QA
process that assumes the presence of hostile actors on the shop
floor is definitely possible.  Such a process would also be needed
at a dedicated facility:  One must assume the presence of hostile
actors there, too.

That's exactly what I'm talking about:  Essentially taking over
the production process and working alongside facility staff, with
particular attention to choke points where validation is both
possible and productive.  ISO quality programs include provision
for onsite participation by clients; it's more a question of
money, and picking a facility that can readily accommodate the
requirements, than of getting anyone to open up any closed
process.  This might deprive one of the advantages of "commercial
trade secret" techniques belonging to the facility's owners, but
that's kind of the whole point of the exercise.  Smaller
facilities with older equipment would be better prospects than the
One should never be certain that one is receiving exactly what was
specified, regardless of validaiton.  Somewhere, the rising curve
of security costs will cross a falling curve of security risks,
and that's as good a place as any to draw a line.  Mark the other
side of the line "here be dragons - maybe."  End users can pick up
any perceived slack if and as they want to spend the money to do so.
Damn straight.  I'm especially picky about the inspection records
of nuclear power facilities; IMO they should include video of the
inspectors at work, especially in hazardous / PITA locations they
might be inclined to skip.  I recall at least one case where
reactor inspection logs were casually falsified for years, very
nearly causing a catastrophic core breach due to undetected

That's not what I have in mind at all.  Everything that touches
the production process would have to be isolated and audited.  In
practical terms, that would mean bringing the computers in
question in from offsite, with relevant software already installed
and validated.
In the context at hand, watching the whole thing play out would
consist of directing the whole process one step at a time, per a
procedure created in collaboration with the contractor's
engineering and QA departments.  Optical masks and/or equivalent
data files would be handled by client personnel and retained for
validation.  The chips that pop out would be under very stringent
property control, and quite a lot of them would be torn down and
thoroughly analyzed "at home" to validate the run.
Just like doing it at an existing commercial facility, with the
added advantage of much better control of physical access,
hardware, etc. at the dedicated facility. Whether that advantage
would be worth the extra costs, vs. real security improvements,
depends on how reliable the post-production tear down and analysis
of end product components is considered.  "A difference that makes
no difference is no difference."
If it really is impossible to build a trusted CPU with an
untrusted CPU, then it is not possible to build a trusted CPU.
Fortunately, trust is not an absolute and there are ways to build
relatively trustworthy systems from relatively untrustworthy
components.  A quote to the effect of "I do not care who votes, I
only care who counts the votes" comes to mind but I'm too lazy to
look it up right now.
I think that in the engineering and business worlds, trust is
always a point on a cost curve.
When Trust and Security are considered as absolutes, the costs of
maintaining them rise exponentially until the protected assets die
of resource starvation.  Civilization as we know it is presently
following the path of demanding absolute security, provided by
rulers vested with absolute trust, to early termination.  Getting
more on the practical business of making IC chips into the public
domain and widely distributed, enabling faster and decentralized
recovery of today's industrial capabilities, is one of the
benefits of open hardware development projects.
The objectives of an open IC project include providing protections
against institutional sabotage, but also the creation of
protocols, documents and data that can be re-used and improved
over time.  Policies and protocols necessary to assure adequate
transparency, including repeatability, would amount to enlarging
the GPL ecosystem to encompass computer hardware as well as
software.  If such a project can't produce products that are cost
effective for end users, it will remain at most a theme park ride
for misguided investors.  The "high security" angle looks like a
place where potential customers and nearly off-the-shelf

And all along I thought, the sooner the Pentagon et al stood down
and let the world be overrun, the better for the human race.
Better in every measurable way, except for the net worth and
sovereign power of the wealthy and powerful gangs that sponsor and
direct those organizations.
Last I heard, police forces were not dispatched to cross borders
and kill large numbers of people, to advance the financial agendas
of some few thousands of the folks back home.  When the police do
what the military does, they become criminals even by the
definition of the laws enacted by their own masters.
Anyone who deliberately and for personal gain participates in mass
murder might be considered "bad."  I prefer to think of them as
ignorant and disinformed, aside from a minority among them who are
psychopathic and in need of minders.
So...  If I understand this correctly, the CIA, a clandestine U.S.
military service, is in the business of persuading Presidents,
elected to embody the will of the People, to their way of
thinking.  Come to think of it, their charter implicity says so.
I guess we should have dumped them when we had the chance.  IIRC a
President once said he was going do just that, too bad somebody
shot him.
Every corporate entity needs intelligence to function.  How many
need a department to promote, codify and implement torture as a

need a department to set up and run major drug smuggling
operations, to fund other violent criminal enterprises off the books

of it, I succeed.  But there's no denying that working for the CIA
in any capacity imparts a certain taint, given that it has been a
criminal enterprise more or less since its inception and shows no
signs of meaningful reform.  By "criminal" I mean, per any common
sense definition that does not duck the issue by asserting that
certain functions of State are by definition "above the law" due
to some existential necessity.  A MAFIA bookkeeper who always does

Practical alternatives to endemic, high dollar institutional
violence are limited by the inherent nature of the institutions
that carry it out:  They exist to impose the will of their masters
on whole societies.  They defeat their masters' specified enemies
by any means necessary, which covers a spectrum from propaganda
through deception, bribery and terrorism to the industrialized
mass murder we call warfare.  Try to stop them; if you show signs
of success, their masters will direct them to neutralize YOU by
any means necessary.
As things stand, we don't have enough volunteers to shut down the
killing machine by direct intervention.  If and when we do, the
emergent organizations that make it possible will also play key
roles in developing long term solutions for international conflicts.
As a practical matter, one must do what one can to stop the
bleeding; such efforts tend to be contagious, and we have ways of
spreading that contagion.  It starts with telling the truth.
Opportunities to do that keep coming faster and faster.
Most people don't know what government is, because those who
govern use a very different definition than the ones the governed
are taught:  State sovereignty is the power to rob, kidnap and
kill withing a given territorial boundary, and to defend these
powers as one's exclusive prerogative.
Anarchists are consistently depicted as violent lunatics opposed
to any form of social order.  The idea that government is based on
the consent of the governed is all well and good in a civics

Maybe not.  Needle vs. haystack and all that.  But again, if you use
the same physical Internet connection to repeatedly do "anonymous"
things, it would be very good if these things were of no real
interest to our Security Services.
I have run TOR relays from time to time.  As long as you are not
running an exit node, nothing bad will happen.  And at least you
know you are adding one "honest" router to the network - unless your
box has been rooted and you don't know who really controls it.
There's mine, for what it's worth.  Te anonymity provided by TOR
(and i2p, Mixmaster, Freenet, etc.) is very limited even in best
case scenarios.  These tools simply can't work when a hostile actor
effectively sees all, knows all, and can fuck with any connection on
demand.  On the brighter side most private, corporate and criminal
attackers would be completely unable to penetrate the security
provided by TOR (or etc.), unless they are in a position to ask the
NSA or a comparable Security Service to do it for them.

I guess we're stuck with Eye Of Sauron and Balrog.  Too bad, this
is a much more Lovecraftian issue IMO:  We are being pulled into a
place where all the angles are "wrong," and watching the most
merciful thing in the world - the inability of hostile actors to
correlate all the contents of the Internet - starting to crumble
away for reals.
Couple of things I can see to work on:
* Publicize this as a quantum leap in network security threats,
requiring new trust models and comms protocols across the board,
to every audience that is likely to understand the problem and
respond proactively.
* Review RFC 6973, Privacy Considerations For Internet Protocols,
and work to amplify/expand sections relevant to what we are
learning about large scale threat actors and their behavior as
observed in the wild.  This RFC is only two years old, so changes
now may have a large impact on results later.
* Think about building an ecosystem of repositories for hashes and
signatures, and protocols for monitoring consensus and assigning
relative trust values to reduce reliance on repo signing keys as
guarantors of software integrity.  Developing comms protocols for
this network would also contribute to general solutions for
hardening networks against the capabilities of our new overlords.
* Think hard about open projects to reverse engineer IC chips with
attention to manufacturer sabotage.  It seems to me that the
likely venue for this would be non-aligned nations (so-called)
with a vested interest in pooling their resources to push back
against universal surveillance & sabotage capabilities of the
Superpowers and their special pets.
*  Keep pressure on all fronts already being worked, i.e.
replacing the HTTPS protocol with something that actually works in
the sense of costing a lot more to defeat.  Make the opposition
spend more money when and wherever possible.
Considering the choice of an apparently competent security
oriented venue to "pen test to destruction" as reported, I wonder
WTF that was about.  Does somebody with control of the resources
used WANT their capabilities publicly disclosed?  If so, was this
a strategic decision from the top, or an act of systemic sabotage
by a lower level actor within the organization in question?  So
many questions, so few clues... so far.

That was my first reaction as well:  But on close inspection he

archives may be weighing heavily on the minds of State and
Corporate strategists.  What good is owning a Panopticon if the
prisoners have data terminals where they can watch the guards and
their employers as they go about their daily lives?
Secrecy as we know it may be on the way out:  With the advent of
networked everything, the secrecy tax Julian Assange wrote about
years ago keeps growing and may reach a tipping point where State
and Corporate secrecy no longer pays.
Propaganda as we know it may be on the way out:  With the advent

I wouldn't mind a world where privacy is a thing of the past, as
long as the playing field is reasonably level.  Control of access
to information is the key to controlling whole societies; both
secrecy and propaganda are essential to the operation of any
repressive regime.  Could authoritarian State and Corporate
institutions exist in a world without privacy, where bad faith
actors have no hiding places?  A world where control of news,

The end of "privacy as we know it" is only a dystopian scenario if
the institutions of authoritarian governance survive in the
post-privacy world.  I don't believe they can survive, because the
same network infrastructure that has already made so much formerly
"private" information public also shifts the balance of power away
from established institutions in fundamental ways.
Keeping State and Corporate secrets out of public view is becoming
progressively more difficult, while the mechanism of ad-hoc self
organizing "smart mob" actions arising from the public at large is
an emergent challenge to established power centers.  If and as
these trends continue to accelerate, the nature of political power
will eventually be transformed.
The opposition takes this prospect very seriously, and is fighting
back through automation of intelligence analysis, adaptive enemies
lists, strategic deployment of reputation management,
astroturfing, censorship, adaptive signal boosting and
degradation, spoofing and disinformation, coordination of
conventional propaganda across formerly isolated domains, etc. etc.
The future I envision is not a dystopia per Orwell or Huxley,
because these models presume the survival of large States and
continued concentration of power in the hands of a ruling elite.
I think that one way or another, large scale authoritarian rule is
on the way out.  One way is the continued development of
established trends in information technology's impact on large
scale social behavior.  The other way is the pending collapse of
the global material economy and substantial re-localization of
production and commerce.  Together, these environmental pressures
drive adaptive responses that are /very/ unfavorable to the

Other tracking vectors available to State level actors include:
* Owning and operating a large fraction of the routers in the
network.  This can be concealed very effectively by using a cloud
server to host all the routers in one place, with exits all over the
world via transparent proxies.  "All in one place" means, monitored
and manipulated in realtime to shape traffic and identify users.
* Monitoring exit node traffic to record browser fingerprints,
cleartext of any data transmitted between the TOR user and any
server on the Internet, and associating these with behavior patterns
indicating a personal interests profile, likely time zones, etc.
* Diverting exit node traffic through a hostile router equipped with
"real" Certificate Authority signing keys negates SSL completely -
connecting to a server via SSH over TOR is the same as connecting to
the server without SSH, if your adversary is NSA.
* Injecting exploits and implants into the TOR user's inbound
traffic from sites on the "normal" Internet, custom tailored to
"climb out of" the TOR browser and take over the user's system.
All of the above are within known capabilities at NSA and, most
likely, Israeli, Chinese and Russian security services.  It is
possible that their biggest problem is tripping over each other's
feet while interfering with TOR users.

services creates big, greasy fingerprints that make tracking anyone

Maybe not.  Needle vs. haystack and all that.  But again, if you use
the same physical Internet connection to repeatedly do "anonymous"
things, it would be very good if these things were of no real
interest to our Security Services.
I have run TOR relays from time to time.  As long as you are not
running an exit node, nothing bad will happen.  And at least you
know you are adding one "honest" router to the network - unless your
box has been rooted and you don't know who really controls it.
There's mine, for what it's worth.  Te anonymity provided by TOR
(and i2p, Mixmaster, Freenet, etc.) is very limited even in best
case scenarios.  These tools simply can't work when a hostile actor
effectively sees all, knows all, and can fuck with any connection on
demand.  On the brighter side most private, corporate and criminal
attackers would be completely unable to penetrate the security
provided by TOR (or etc.), unless they are in a position to ask the
NSA or a comparable Security Service to do it for them.

I guess we're stuck with Eye Of Sauron and Balrog.  Too bad, this
is a much more Lovecraftian issue IMO:  We are being pulled into a
place where all the angles are "wrong," and watching the most
merciful thing in the world - the inability of hostile actors to
correlate all the contents of the Internet - starting to crumble
away for reals.
Couple of things I can see to work on:
* Publicize this as a quantum leap in network security threats,
requiring new trust models and comms protocols across the board,
to every audience that is likely to understand the problem and
respond proactively.
* Review RFC 6973, Privacy Considerations For Internet Protocols,
and work to amplify/expand sections relevant to what we are
learning about large scale threat actors and their behavior as
observed in the wild.  This RFC is only two years old, so changes
now may have a large impact on results later.
* Think about building an ecosystem of repositories for hashes and
signatures, and protocols for monitoring consensus and assigning
relative trust values to reduce reliance on repo signing keys as
guarantors of software integrity.  Developing comms protocols for
this network would also contribute to general solutions for
hardening networks against the capabilities of our new overlords.
* Think hard about open projects to reverse engineer IC chips with
attention to manufacturer sabotage.  It seems to me that the
likely venue for this would be non-aligned nations (so-called)
with a vested interest in pooling their resources to push back
against universal surveillance & sabotage capabilities of the
Superpowers and their special pets.
*  Keep pressure on all fronts already being worked, i.e.
replacing the HTTPS protocol with something that actually works in
the sense of costing a lot more to defeat.  Make the opposition
spend more money when and wherever possible.
Considering the choice of an apparently competent security
oriented venue to "pen test to destruction" as reported, I wonder
WTF that was about.  Does somebody with control of the resources
used WANT their capabilities publicly disclosed?  If so, was this
a strategic decision from the top, or an act of systemic sabotage
by a lower level actor within the organization in question?  So
many questions, so few clues... so far.

That's kind of spooky, in that I re-read Vernor Vinge's True Names
just yesterday.
But I think it's more likely that some public servant or private
contractor unleashed the Balrog on those folks without a work
order, and made it painfully obvious to them on purpose, to settle
some personal grudge.  If so, well played:  The full public
disclosure that this act set in motion will be of considerable
benefit to the 'victims' in the long run.

That was my first reaction as well:  But on close inspection he
seems take the exponential growth of universal surveillance as a
given, while the ability to correlate the collected information
into actionable intelligence can and should be restricted to large
organizations:  "Most privacy laws exist to block government
actions. A few exist to block private institutional actions. But
none exist to block individuals' actions."
I interpret this as a response to the accelerating progress of
open source collection and analysis into contexts formerly
monopolized by State and Corporate actors.  A war of sorts is
already underway on this front; else why is Barrett Brown doing
time for the crime of investigative journalism?  Nobody stands to
lose more in a truly open society than our professional secret
keepers and sanctioned violators of the secrets of others.  Like
the good folks who pay the bills at In-Q-Tel.
Recent events including the exposure of Federal employee records
and the integration of ICWatch data into Wikileaks' searchable
archives may be weighing heavily on the minds of State and
Corporate strategists.  What good is owning a Panopticon if the
prisoners have data terminals where they can watch the guards and
their employers as they go about their daily lives?
Secrecy as we know it may be on the way out:  With the advent of
networked everything, the secrecy tax Julian Assange wrote about
years ago keeps growing and may reach a tipping point where State
and Corporate secrecy no longer pays.
Propaganda as we know it may be on the way out:  With the advent
of networked everybody, identity groups and market segments
created and manipulated by broadcast propaganda are running on
inertia.  The 'ego casting' and 'echo chamber' effects that
segregate the Internet today are at best leaky containers whose
walls are getting thinner all the time.
I wouldn't mind a world where privacy is a thing of the past, as
long as the playing field is reasonably level.  Control of access
to information is the key to controlling whole societies; both
secrecy and propaganda are essential to the operation of any
repressive regime.  Could authoritarian State and Corporate
institutions exist in a world without privacy, where bad faith
actors have no hiding places?  A world where control of news,
information, education and entertainment is diffused across tens
of millions of actors?

The end of "privacy as we know it" is only a dystopian scenario if
the institutions of authoritarian governance survive in the
post-privacy world.  I don't believe they can survive, because the
same network infrastructure that has already made so much formerly
"private" information public also shifts the balance of power away
from established institutions in fundamental ways.
Keeping State and Corporate secrets out of public view is becoming
progressively more difficult, while the mechanism of ad-hoc self
organizing "smart mob" actions arising from the public at large is
an emergent challenge to established power centers.  If and as
these trends continue to accelerate, the nature of political power
will eventually be transformed.
The opposition takes this prospect very seriously, and is fighting
back through automation of intelligence analysis, adaptive enemies
lists, strategic deployment of reputation management,
astroturfing, censorship, adaptive signal boosting and
degradation, spoofing and disinformation, coordination of
conventional propaganda across formerly isolated domains, etc. etc.
The future I envision is not a dystopia per Orwell or Huxley,
because these models presume the survival of large States and
continued concentration of power in the hands of a ruling elite.
I think that one way or another, large scale authoritarian rule is
on the way out.  One way is the continued development of
established trends in information technology's impact on large
scale social behavior.  The other way is the pending collapse of
the global material economy and substantial re-localization of
production and commerce.  Together, these environmental pressures
drive adaptive responses that are /very/ unfavorable to the
interests of our present rulers.

In my view Occupy was a tremendous success, because the camps
became venues for intensive political education and practical
training that changed the nature of radical politics and populist
actions in the U.S.  We still have many miles left to go, but at
least something's finally on the move again.
The anarchist veterans of Occupy seem to be the glue that holds a
lot of today's ad hoc activist coalitions together, because Occupy
taught its participants how to run consensus driven groups, and
gave them practical experience in organizing and executing public
events in a spectrum from "family friendly" to rude and

their demographic is now well represented in public events that
have little or nothing to do with partisan politics. The Bernie

so who show up for a well organized public event sponsored by
radicals, three or four are likely to stick and help run the next on

to do, determined by their interests, abilities and motivations. A
keyboard and mouse may be enough for some folks, and those who do
it well contribute a lot of value.  But the ones who get up on
their feet and down to the street will be the ones who actually
change something.  How can a local community voluntarily blow up
the bridge over the swamp and raise their own flag, without a
process for consensus and people who know how to beat some
practical results out of the resulting clusterfuck?

That's the way both military and commercial contracting usually
works in the U.S. as well:  The vendor makes a deal with the
purchasing agent, x units for y dollars, informally and off the
record.  Then the purchasing agent revises the specification so
that only the vendor in question can qualify.  The competitive
bidding process then proceeds normally, on the record, and as far
as the audit trail is concerned it's all perfectly legal.
The kickbacks are laundered in various ways; the most popular
method for military purchasing agents is for the vendors to hire
them as consultants when they leave the service, with
extraordinary pay and bonuses for little to no work performed.
Lots of other scams are also used, but the system described above

I would say the author was politically naive.  His list of reforms
that a hypothetical Dictator of the United States could implement
to fix things, essentially consists of abolishing the functions of
the State in one sweeping blow, and (presumably) letting the
infallible Market replace them with something better.  But then I
realized he was pushing offshore Real Estate by promoting the idea
that "nothing can be done" to improve conditions in the U.S.
He also seems like applying the Laws O' Physics to large scale
human problems, which I'm all for.  But he manages to breeze right
past the inconvenient truth that a human population crash will be
well underway by the end of the century if not WAY sooner; I guess
that would make overseas Real Estate sound less desirable as a
retirement solution.
In re the Deep State, I'm all about "destroy the motherfucker," as
that's a guaranteed winning position:  It has already destroyed
itself, in that no human agency will be able to turn it from the
course it is committed to:  Perpetual exponential growth inside a
closed container.
The question is, how to "destroy the motherfucker" in a manner
that makes things better instead of worse?  Or, how best to
mitigate the human costs of the Deep State's self destruction.  My
preferred solution:  A revival of populist politics, in the sense
of large numbers of "regular folks" doing whatever it takes to

stolen from them over the last ... um ... history of Western

In the English language, every meaning of the word "fuck," except
one, references violence or damage.  I'm gonna fuck you up, he
really got fucked over, they fucked us out of it, this fucking
shit sucks.  "Fuck you" is an expression of anger or challenge.
Conversational use of the word "fuck" is commonplace in the
military services and among economically and otherwise repressed
minority populations, but much less so in "polite" society where
all forms of routine violence are kept out of sight or at least
have lace doilies on top of them.
I have long held that the true meaning of "fuck" reflects a
profound social psychosis, normalized through centuries of common
usage and elaborate rationalizations, where sex IS violence.  When
the word "violence" is understood in the context of Anarchist or
Libertarian ideology as "violation" of the personal integrity of
another by force, deception or strategic subterfuge, numerous
everyday examples of sexual assault, sexual repression and sexual
exploitation come to mind.  (Voice over, Eric Idle:  "Now we see
the violence inherent in the system!")
I got no time for "Liberal Feminism" 'cause that word Liberal
denotes a "loyal opposition" to Establishment institutions based
on violence.  Liberals complain politely to their rulers, and are
kind to people they personally know, so it's not their fault if
their path to personal comfort and security is paved with the
bones of murdered children.
The Women's Lib faction of the New Left complained rudely, and set
their sights on personal power and dominance, vs. the mere comfort
and security that their Liberal counterparts still aspire to:  A
"radical movement" with not one bad thing to say about mass murder
as long as their favored team is doing it.
The fall of Saigon and what came after provides a wonderful

War is public murder for private profit.  I don't know of any

whenever it's Guys vs. Guys the best that can be accomplished is

Collaborative actions based on a sane balance between individual
and community interests are possible, history provides numerous
examples at scales ranging from the family and village to tribe
and nation.  With the exception of defective individuals, human
beings are naturally inclined to form communities, to identify
with those communities, and to work in the common interests of
those communities.  I call the people who lack this natural
inclination "defective" as their actions tend toward negative
impacts on group survival in the long term.
Today we have a really big problem in the form of really big
countries:  Human communities do not scale to that size.  Compare
the "community values" performance of Iceland, population 1/3
million, to the performance of the good ole U.S.A., population
360+ million.
Attempts to scale community values to the size of a large country
always involve creating administrative classes, insular
communities of professionals in commercial and political
governance who facilitate artificial "bonds of community" between
massive numbers of strangers who will never meet.  Viola, rent
seeking absentee landlords who employ armed guards to enforce
their orders.  If communities regulated by these institutions are
small enough, it is possible for the people to regulate their
regulators; but somewhere between 1/3 and 300 million population,
the balance of power shifts disastrously toward the managerial

The word "collectivism" carries a lot of baggage, as it has been
flown as a banner over many authoritarian, violent dictatorships
"of the proletariat."  But the base concept of concern for the
well being of one's community as integral to one's own well being
has also been called compassion, honor and common sense.
Darwinian evolution does not favor the me-first individualist,
however strong, dominant, awesome, etc. that individual may be.
Humans have a genetic predisposition to form families, villages
and tribes, to identify with them and hold the interests of the
group at co-equal to self interest.  Purely self centered motives
are socially pathological, and Darwinian evolution selects against
this trait:  Because the awesome dominance of the "fittest" has
negative long term survival value, compared to those who work at
maintaining a strong, resilient community that provides a
favorable environment for the whole community's progeny out to the
Nth generation.  When the smartest guys in the room tell us
otherwise, they are not mistaken:  They are lying.  The more power
is afforded to purely self-interested socioeconomic "winners," the
more their actions damage the long term viability of the community.
Big problems arise when unnaturally large "communities," i.e.
States exist, because they can not exist without the services of
an elite group of political and economic power brokers who provide
millions (!) of subjects with a convincing illusion of "community"
with people they will never meet in real life.  Deception alone
won't do the job, so armed guards must also be employed to enforce
the orders of these facilitators.  Viola:  Rent-seeking absentee
landlords, serving their own interests at the expense of the
ersatz "communities" they rule.  It's all downhill from there.
"Democracy" so-called, an attempt at community self regulation
among strangers who will never meet, does not scale well.  My
favorite historical example is the response of Iceland and the
United States to the "financial crisis" of 2008.  Iceland,
population 1/3 million, responded as a human community, "regulated
the regulators" and has since jailed corrupt bankers who failed to
flee the country in time.  The United States, population 360+
million, responded as directed by the perpetrators of a massive
fraud, and rewarded them handsomely for their efforts.
Any -ism that is proposed to replace the policies of an existing
large State without eliminating that State, promising Utopian
outcomes, is at best a shockingly ignorant error in judgement.
But it is more likely a deliberate swindle backed by socially
pathological "individuals" and interest groups.  If the -ism
involves a large State with a putative monopoly on violence (as
violation: robbery, kidnapping, murder), it's just one more brand
label and PR campaign for Fascism.
Any -ism that proposes breaking up large States into small,
independent communities governed without delegating decision
making authority to "representatives" is difficult to implement
anywhere the modern State has taken root.  Intellectual types
rarely approve of any such scheme, because it would mean trusting
people to "do the right thing" of their own accord, without
morally and mentally superior guidance from On High.  But I am

away from population centers; they are very hungry machines that
will start to fail in very bad ways whenever any of their major

industrial economy crumbles everyone will get the same bright idea
and that land ain't empty.  It's occupied by communities where it
takes time to learn the human landscape and build trust

an economic role that will continue to pay off in the form of

As for cash money, I like silver way more than gold:  People will
kill you much sooner for gold than silver, and the value of silver
has been steadily rising due to industrial applications drawing
down the world supply faster than mining is able to replace it.
Another thing to think about is identifying technology that will
stay relevant to the practical concerns of feeding and housing

I would be surprised if he did deliver docs to the Russians.  Now

Snowden is a bit of a fiend for OpSec.  As such, I can't see him
carrying red hot docs, or the means of accessing them, around with
him after confirmed delivery to Greenwald & Co.  In the first
place, doing so would make him a more valuable target for multiple
State actors.  Second, it would provide a big reward to anyone who
might have managed to snatch him and turn him inside out; if he
had nothing, it would at least provide him the satisfaction of
knowing that his captors got nothing of value out of him.
Since it's very credible that Russia was not his intended
destination, the concept of buying his way in with classified
information (a la Lee Oswald) just doesn't fit.  Russia's handling
of Snowden so far has been consistent with their propaganda
objective of appearing to be morally superior to their US/NATO
adversaries in Cold War II.  One might also note that Snowden has
always spoken politely of his Russian hosts but has not made any
overtly pro-Russian propaganda broadcasts.

Altruism, mentioned earlier, is hard wired into that; otherwise,

Thanks for the heads up - the last time you posted part 1, I found i
I would say the author was politically naive.  His list of reforms
that a hypothetical Dictator of the United States could implement
to fix things, essentially consists of abolishing the functions of
the State in one sweeping blow, and (presumably) letting the
infallible Market replace them with something better.  But then I
realized he was pushing offshore Real Estate by promoting the idea
that "nothing can be done" to improve conditions in the U.S.
He also seems like applying the Laws O' Physics to large scale
human problems, which I'm all for.  But he manages to breeze right
past the inconvenient truth that a human population crash will be
well underway by the end of the century if not WAY sooner; I guess
that would make overseas Real Estate sound less desirable as a
retirement solution.
In re the Deep State, I'm all about "destroy the motherfucker," as
that's a guaranteed winning position:  It has already destroyed
itself, in that no human agency will be able to turn it from the
course it is committed to:  Perpetual exponential growth inside a
closed container.
The question is, how to "destroy the motherfucker" in a manner
that makes things better instead of worse?  Or, how best to
mitigate the human costs of the Deep State's self destruction.  My
preferred solution:  A revival of populist politics, in the sense
of large numbers of "regular folks" doing whatever it takes to
steal back some useful amount of the power that their rulers have
stolen from them over the last ... um ... history of Western

I assumed this:  This essay describes the Deep State as "national policy decisions
... being forged by a small group of power elite ... bound
together by shared class interests" and "the political process as
being dominated by corporate interests which coalesce into
factions and compete to guide policy."
The TPP and similar deals under negotiation indicate that the
'establishment' in question is trans-national.  The content of
these negotiations indicates that its agenda is, as always, more
money and power for the ruling class at any expense to anyone else.
I just call it real life.
Per my own pet theories, today's Deep State will self destruct by
virtue of its own existence:  Unbreakable commitments vs. Laws o'
Thermodynamics, never mind the details.  In that model, the actual
"fall" of the Deep State is already in progress, as part of a
complex and turbulent transitional period with historically
unprecedented features.  We do live in interesting times.

Now y'all done set me off.  Stand back, I'm a gonna RANT.
I'm a think Cari would be right at home on the Group W bench, and
I don't think anyone will call her "moral enough to join the Army
and burn women kids houses and villages" after being listed as a
troll and/or spammer on Cypherpunks.
In the English language, every meaning of the word "fuck," except
one, references violence or damage.  I'm gonna fuck you up, he
really got fucked over, they fucked us out of it, this fucking
shit sucks.  "Fuck you" is an expression of anger or challenge.
Conversational use of the word "fuck" is commonplace in the
military services and among economically and otherwise repressed
minority populations, but much less so in "polite" society where
all forms of routine violence are kept out of sight or at least
have lace doilies on top of them.
I have long held that the true meaning of "fuck" reflects a
profound social psychosis, normalized through centuries of common
usage and elaborate rationalizations, where sex IS violence.  When
the word "violence" is understood in the context of Anarchist or
Libertarian ideology as "violation" of the personal integrity of
another by force, deception or strategic subterfuge, numerous
everyday examples of sexual assault, sexual repression and sexual
exploitation come to mind.  (Voice over, Eric Idle:  "Now we see
the violence inherent in the system!")
I got no time for "Liberal Feminism" 'cause that word Liberal
denotes a "loyal opposition" to Establishment institutions based
on violence.  Liberals complain politely to their rulers, and are
kind to people they personally know, so it's not their fault if
their path to personal comfort and security is paved with the
bones of murdered children.
The Women's Lib faction of the New Left complained rudely, and set
their sights on personal power and dominance, vs. the mere comfort
and security that their Liberal counterparts still aspire to:  A
"radical movement" with not one bad thing to say about mass murder
as long as their favored team is doing it.
The fall of Saigon and what came after provides a wonderful
"teachable moment" in U.S. political history:  A coalition of
Pacifist using Joan Baez as their front man took out a full page
ad in the Times, calling out Hanoi for carrying out massive purges
in "south" Vietnam.  A coalition of New Left groups using Hanoi
Jane as their front man responded with a full page ad in the
Times, calling out the Pacifists as counter-revolutionary running
dogs and congratulating their comrades in arms overseas.

War is public murder for private profit.  I don't know of any
counter-examples.  Again we are up against a collective psychosis,
normalized by a long history of public acceptance and elaborate
rationalizations.  Sometimes one sees Bad Guys vs. Worse Guys, but
whenever it's Guys vs. Guys the best that can be accomplished is
some amount of damage control.  Everyone who takes up arms to
settle the disputes of their rulers and de facto owners is a
traitor to the human race as a whole.
The "fog of war" has another name, propaganda, and all sides of
every armed conflict write press releases to establish that their
only motive is "necessary self defence," or the currently popular
"responsibility to protect others."  The other side of every armed
conflict always started it, and the regular folks on the other
side of that border deserve whatever happens to them because they
failed to stop it.
Too much factual information about war results in large numbers of
people banding together to have a go at kicking the war machine to
pieces.  So never mind that "ain't gonna study war no more" crap;
study the fuck out of war and encourage others to do likewise.

guys in the room" say otherwise, they are not mistaken:  They are
Collaborative actions based on a sane balance between individual
and community interests are possible, history provides numerous
examples at scales ranging from the family and village to tribe
and nation.  With the exception of defective individuals, human
beings are naturally inclined to form communities, to identify
with those communities, and to work in the common interests of
those communities.  I call the people who lack this natural
inclination "defective" as their actions tend toward negative
impacts on group survival in the long term.
Today we have a really big problem in the form of really big
countries:  Human communities do not scale to that size.  Compare
the "community values" performance of Iceland, population 1/3
million, to the performance of the good ole U.S.A., population
360+ million.
Attempts to scale community values to the size of a large country
always involve creating administrative classes, insular
communities of professionals in commercial and political
governance who facilitate artificial "bonds of community" between
massive numbers of strangers who will never meet.  Viola, rent
seeking absentee landlords who employ armed guards to enforce
their orders.  If communities regulated by these institutions are
small enough, it is possible for the people to regulate their
regulators; but somewhere between 1/3 and 300 million population,
the balance of power shifts disastrously toward the managerial
class, which becomes a ruling class.
Expositions of political theory are supposed to end with a formula
for creating Utopian outcomes, and a call to action.  Sorry, I'm
out of stock on those items and the shop down the street was
busted for selling toxic imitations.  But I do think that those
who occupy themselves with building, maintaining and defending
sane communities, where and as opportunities to do so arise, will
be big winners compared to those who remain attached to
authoritarian top-down rule by any name.

The word "collectivism" carries a lot of baggage, as it has been
flown as a banner over many authoritarian, violent dictatorships
"of the proletariat."  But the base concept of concern for the
well being of one's community as integral to one's own well being
has also been called compassion, honor and common sense.
Darwinian evolution does not favor the me-first individualist,
however strong, dominant, awesome, etc. that individual may be.
Humans have a genetic predisposition to form families, villages
and tribes, to identify with them and hold the interests of the
group at co-equal to self interest.  Purely self centered motives
are socially pathological, and Darwinian evolution selects against
this trait:  Because the awesome dominance of the "fittest" has
negative long term survival value, compared to those who work at
maintaining a strong, resilient community that provides a
favorable environment for the whole community's progeny out to the
Nth generation.  When the smartest guys in the room tell us
otherwise, they are not mistaken:  They are lying.  The more power
is afforded to purely self-interested socioeconomic "winners," the
more their actions damage the long term viability of the community.
Big problems arise when unnaturally large "communities," i.e.
States exist, because they can not exist without the services of
an elite group of political and economic power brokers who provide
millions (!) of subjects with a convincing illusion of "community"
with people they will never meet in real life.  Deception alone
won't do the job, so armed guards must also be employed to enforce
the orders of these facilitators.  Viola:  Rent-seeking absentee
landlords, serving their own interests at the expense of the
ersatz "communities" they rule.  It's all downhill from there.
"Democracy" so-called, an attempt at community self regulation
among strangers who will never meet, does not scale well.  My
favorite historical example is the response of Iceland and the
United States to the "financial crisis" of 2008.  Iceland,
population 1/3 million, responded as a human community, "regulated
the regulators" and has since jailed corrupt bankers who failed to
flee the country in time.  The United States, population 360+
million, responded as directed by the perpetrators of a massive
fraud, and rewarded them handsomely for their efforts.
Any -ism that is proposed to replace the policies of an existing
large State without eliminating that State, promising Utopian
outcomes, is at best a shockingly ignorant error in judgement.
But it is more likely a deliberate swindle backed by socially
pathological "individuals" and interest groups.  If the -ism
involves a large State with a putative monopoly on violence (as
violation: robbery, kidnapping, murder), it's just one more brand
label and PR campaign for Fascism.
Any -ism that proposes breaking up large States into small,
independent communities governed without delegating decision
making authority to "representatives" is difficult to implement
anywhere the modern State has taken root.  Intellectual types
rarely approve of any such scheme, because it would mean trusting
people to "do the right thing" of their own accord, without
morally and mentally superior guidance from On High.  But I am
confident that people who implement such schemes where and as
possible stand the best chance of producing societies worth living
in.  We are heading into a global industrial and human population
crash that will produce numerous local opportunities to do just that
And that's why I look forward to the End Of The World with
considerable optimism.  By definition the real "collectivists"
will be the long term winners, and I don't think that will be a
Bad Thing.

Also: Edward Snowden denies making a deal with the Russian secret service
I would be surprised if he did deliver docs to the Russians.  Now
that we have had a better look at him, it seems that our Mr.
Snowden is a bit of a fiend for OpSec.  As such, I can't see him
carrying red hot docs, or the means of accessing them, around with
him after confirmed delivery to Greenwald & Co.  In the first
place, doing so would make him a more valuable target for multiple
State actors.  Second, it would provide a big reward to anyone who
might have managed to snatch him and turn him inside out; if he
had nothing, it would at least provide him the satisfaction of
knowing that his captors got nothing of value out of him.
Since it's very credible that Russia was not his intended
destination, the concept of buying his way in with classified
information (a la Lee Oswald) just doesn't fit.  Russia's handling
of Snowden so far has been consistent with their propaganda
objective of appearing to be morally superior to their US/NATO
adversaries in Cold War II.  One might also note that Snowden has
always spoken politely of his Russian hosts but has not made any
overtly pro-Russian propaganda broadcasts.

Thanks for the heads up - the last time you posted part 1, I found i
I would say the author was politically naive.  His list of reforms
that a hypothetical Dictator of the United States could implement
to fix things, essentially consists of abolishing the functions of
the State in one sweeping blow, and (presumably) letting the
infallible Market replace them with something better.  But then I
realized he was pushing offshore Real Estate by promoting the idea
that "nothing can be done" to improve conditions in the U.S.
He also seems like applying the Laws O' Physics to large scale
human problems, which I'm all for.  But he manages to breeze right
past the inconvenient truth that a human population crash will be
well underway by the end of the century if not WAY sooner; I guess
that would make overseas Real Estate sound less desirable as a
retirement solution.
In re the Deep State, I'm all about "destroy the motherfucker," as
that's a guaranteed winning position:  It has already destroyed
itself, in that no human agency will be able to turn it from the
course it is committed to:  Perpetual exponential growth inside a
closed container.
The question is, how to "destroy the motherfucker" in a manner
that makes things better instead of worse?  Or, how best to
mitigate the human costs of the Deep State's self destruction.  My
preferred solution:  A revival of populist politics, in the sense
of large numbers of "regular folks" doing whatever it takes to
steal back some useful amount of the power that their rulers have
stolen from them over the last ... um ... history of Western

I assumed this:  This essay describes the Deep State as "national policy decisions
... being forged by a small group of power elite ... bound
together by shared class interests" and "the political process as
being dominated by corporate interests which coalesce into
factions and compete to guide policy."
The TPP and similar deals under negotiation indicate that the
'establishment' in question is trans-national.  The content of
these negotiations indicates that its agenda is, as always, more
money and power for the ruling class at any expense to anyone else.
I just call it real life.
Per my own pet theories, today's Deep State will self destruct by
virtue of its own existence:  Unbreakable commitments vs. Laws o'
Thermodynamics, never mind the details.  In that model, the actual
"fall" of the Deep State is already in progress, as part of a
complex and turbulent transitional period with historically

I don't think anyone will call her "moral enough to join the Army

troll and/or spammer on Cypherpunks.
In the English language, every meaning of the word "fuck," except
one, references violence or damage.  I'm gonna fuck you up, he
really got fucked over, they fucked us out of it, this fucking
shit sucks.  "Fuck you" is an expression of anger or challenge.
Conversational use of the word "fuck" is commonplace in the
military services and among economically and otherwise repressed
minority populations, but much less so in "polite" society where
all forms of routine violence are kept out of sight or at least
have lace doilies on top of them.
I have long held that the true meaning of "fuck" reflects a
profound social psychosis, normalized through centuries of common
usage and elaborate rationalizations, where sex IS violence.  When
the word "violence" is understood in the context of Anarchist or
Libertarian ideology as "violation" of the personal integrity of
another by force, deception or strategic subterfuge, numerous
everyday examples of sexual assault, sexual repression and sexual
exploitation come to mind.  (Voice over, Eric Idle:  "Now we see
the violence inherent in the system!")
I got no time for "Liberal Feminism" 'cause that word Liberal
denotes a "loyal opposition" to Establishment institutions based
on violence.  Liberals complain politely to their rulers, and are
kind to people they personally know, so it's not their fault if
their path to personal comfort and security is paved with the
bones of murdered children.
The Women's Lib faction of the New Left complained rudely, and set
their sights on personal power and dominance, vs. the mere comfort
and security that their Liberal counterparts still aspire to:  A
"radical movement" with not one bad thing to say about mass murder
as long as their favored team is doing it.
The fall of Saigon and what came after provides a wonderful
"teachable moment" in U.S. political history:  A coalition of
Pacifist using Joan Baez as their front man took out a full page
ad in the Times, calling out Hanoi for carrying out massive purges
in "south" Vietnam.  A coalition of New Left groups using Hanoi
Jane as their front man responded with a full page ad in the
Times, calling out the Pacifists as counter-revolutionary running
dogs and congratulating their comrades in arms overseas.

War is public murder for private profit.  I don't know of any
counter-examples.  Again we are up against a collective psychosis,
normalized by a long history of public acceptance and elaborate
rationalizations.  Sometimes one sees Bad Guys vs. Worse Guys, but
whenever it's Guys vs. Guys the best that can be accomplished is
some amount of damage control.  Everyone who takes up arms to
settle the disputes of their rulers and de facto owners is a
traitor to the human race as a whole.
The "fog of war" has another name, propaganda, and all sides of
every armed conflict write press releases to establish that their
only motive is "necessary self defence," or the currently popular
"responsibility to protect others."  The other side of every armed
conflict always started it, and the regular folks on the other
side of that border deserve whatever happens to them because they
failed to stop it.
Too much factual information about war results in large numbers of
people banding together to have a go at kicking the war machine to
pieces.  So never mind that "ain't gonna study war no more" crap;
study the fuck out of war and encourage others to do likewise.

The longevity of a culture tends to be inversely proportional to
the power of entirely self centered individuals in that culture.

out as one.  Lookit the good ole U.S.A. after 35 years of

Darwinian evolution does not favor the greedy, self-interested
individual. Darwinian evolution favors clusters of individuals
whose predisposition to take care of others assures that their Nth
generation progeny have the best shot at survival because they are
supported by a stable and resilient community.  When "the smartest
guys in the room" say otherwise, they are not mistaken:  They are
Collaborative actions based on a sane balance between individual
and community interests are possible, history provides numerous
examples at scales ranging from the family and village to tribe
and nation.  With the exception of defective individuals, human
beings are naturally inclined to form communities, to identify
with those communities, and to work in the common interests of
those communities.  I call the people who lack this natural
inclination "defective" as their actions tend toward negative
impacts on group survival in the long term.
Today we have a really big problem in the form of really big
countries:  Human communities do not scale to that size.  Compare
the "community values" performance of Iceland, population 1/3
million, to the performance of the good ole U.S.A., population
360+ million.
Attempts to scale community values to the size of a large country
always involve creating administrative classes, insular
communities of professionals in commercial and political
governance who facilitate artificial "bonds of community" between
massive numbers of strangers who will never meet.  Viola, rent
seeking absentee landlords who employ armed guards to enforce
their orders.  If communities regulated by these institutions are
small enough, it is possible for the people to regulate their
regulators; but somewhere between 1/3 and 300 million population,
the balance of power shifts disastrously toward the managerial
class, which becomes a ruling class.
Expositions of political theory are supposed to end with a formula
for creating Utopian outcomes, and a call to action.  Sorry, I'm
out of stock on those items and the shop down the street was
busted for selling toxic imitations.  But I do think that those
who occupy themselves with building, maintaining and defending
sane communities, where and as opportunities to do so arise, will
be big winners compared to those who remain attached to
authoritarian top-down rule by any name.

The word "collectivism" carries a lot of baggage, as it has been
flown as a banner over many authoritarian, violent dictatorships
"of the proletariat."  But the base concept of concern for the
well being of one's community as integral to one's own well being
has also been called compassion, honor and common sense.
Darwinian evolution does not favor the me-first individualist,
however strong, dominant, awesome, etc. that individual may be.
Humans have a genetic predisposition to form families, villages
and tribes, to identify with them and hold the interests of the
group at co-equal to self interest.  Purely self centered motives
are socially pathological, and Darwinian evolution selects against
this trait:  Because the awesome dominance of the "fittest" has
negative long term survival value, compared to those who work at
maintaining a strong, resilient community that provides a
favorable environment for the whole community's progeny out to the
Nth generation.  When the smartest guys in the room tell us
otherwise, they are not mistaken:  They are lying.  The more power
is afforded to purely self-interested socioeconomic "winners," the
more their actions damage the long term viability of the community.
Big problems arise when unnaturally large "communities," i.e.
States exist, because they can not exist without the services of
an elite group of political and economic power brokers who provide
millions (!) of subjects with a convincing illusion of "community"
with people they will never meet in real life.  Deception alone
won't do the job, so armed guards must also be employed to enforce
the orders of these facilitators.  Viola:  Rent-seeking absentee
landlords, serving their own interests at the expense of the
ersatz "communities" they rule.  It's all downhill from there.
"Democracy" so-called, an attempt at community self regulation
among strangers who will never meet, does not scale well.  My
favorite historical example is the response of Iceland and the
United States to the "financial crisis" of 2008.  Iceland,
population 1/3 million, responded as a human community, "regulated
the regulators" and has since jailed corrupt bankers who failed to
flee the country in time.  The United States, population 360+
million, responded as directed by the perpetrators of a massive
fraud, and rewarded them handsomely for their efforts.
Any -ism that is proposed to replace the policies of an existing
large State without eliminating that State, promising Utopian
outcomes, is at best a shockingly ignorant error in judgement.
But it is more likely a deliberate swindle backed by socially
pathological "individuals" and interest groups.  If the -ism
involves a large State with a putative monopoly on violence (as
violation: robbery, kidnapping, murder), it's just one more brand
label and PR campaign for Fascism.
Any -ism that proposes breaking up large States into small,
independent communities governed without delegating decision
making authority to "representatives" is difficult to implement
anywhere the modern State has taken root.  Intellectual types
rarely approve of any such scheme, because it would mean trusting
people to "do the right thing" of their own accord, without
morally and mentally superior guidance from On High.  But I am
confident that people who implement such schemes where and as
possible stand the best chance of producing societies worth living
in.  We are heading into a global industrial and human population
crash that will produce numerous local opportunities to do just that
And that's why I look forward to the End Of The World with
considerable optimism.  By definition the real "collectivists"
will be the long term winners, and I don't think that will be a
Bad Thing.

whatever it can to keep U.S. forces busy elsewhere in its
neighborhood, drawing down U.S. manpower and material resources
and denying the U.S. safe access to staging areas, well controlled
rear areas and flanks, etc.
So... if successful, Iran's nuclear weapons program would render
their present defence strategy obsolete, presumably closing out
their sponsorship of "destabilizing" forces in the region.  If

Google employs two contractors with an army of humans to review

stuffing, hidden text irrelevant to the site's content, etc.; on
discovery, offending sites are de-rated and "sandboxed" so that
only searches for the exact URL of the offender's site appear in
Google search results. But an SEO contractor with hundreds of
totally ignorant clients (i.e., hundreds of clients) can spread a
well paid (or personal grudge based) suppression campaign like the
one described across hundreds of domains to keep the spam alive
and working.
The distribution of "search spam" that is referenced here could be
bad luck - some sleazy SEO contractor cut and pasted the text just
because it was natural language and contained specific terms
relevant to some of their customers' sites.  Or, and IMO more
likely, someone contracted to have the info in question removed
from the Internet by poisoning search indexes.
Either way, if you put up a web page that has the relevant text in
it, that page should rise above the irrelevant crap in search
results within a couple of months.  The specific search terms you
want to become findable should be included in an H1 header at or
near the top of the page, and in the first paragraph.  Naming an

effective trick.  The same words and phrases should be included in
the "description" meta-tag field of the page header.  (The

The Power Elite, C. Wright Mills, Oxford University Press, 1956
"The power elite is composed of political, economic, and military
men, but this instituted elite is frequently in some tension: it
comes together only on certain coinciding points and only on
certain occasions of ‘crisis.’ In the long peace of the nineteenth
century, the military were not in the high councils of state, not
of the political directorate, and neither were the economic men —
they made raids upon the state but they did not join its
directorate. During the ‘thirties, the political man was
ascendant. Now the military and the corporate men are in top
"Of the three types of circle that compose the power elite today,
it is the military that has benefited the most in its enhanced
power, although the corporate circles have also become more
explicitly intrenched in the more public decision-making circles.
It is the professional politician that has lost the most, so much
that in examining the events and decisions, one is tempted to
speak of a political vacuum in which the corporate rich and the
high warlord, in their coinciding interests, rule.
Excerpt:  Mentioned this earlier, mentioning it again:
National Security and Double Government, Michael J. Glennon,
Harvard National Security Journal, 2014
"The United States has, in short, moved beyond a mere imperial
presidency to a bifurcated  system — a structure of double
government — in which even the President now exercises little
substantive control over the overall direction of U.S. national
security policy. Whereas Britain’s dual institutions evolved
towards a concealed republic, America’s have evolved in the
opposite direction, toward  greater centralization, less
accountability, and emergent autocracy."

In Central Florida in the 1960s, midwinter frost was very often

By the 1980s frost was very rarely seen, and many who have lived
in the area since 2000 or so have never seen frost.  From at least
the 1960s through 1980s, seasonal hard freezes were seen during
most winters.  Since around 2000, hard freezes only happen when
major storm fronts come down from the Arctic.
In the same part of the world, a widespread and very visible
native plant called the beauty berry would produce the purple
berries it is named for in early fall, shortly after the last hot

hundreds of square miles.  Beginning in the late 1990s, the beauty
berry is no longer a reliable predictor of the weather:  It now
produces its berries in isolated patches, across a span of about
six weeks.

predict their observations are stupidly simple and easy to

The SanBerdino* iPhone Massacre:  A Post Mortem
In a case involving "terrorism" and any "Middle Eastern person,"
the FBI has unlawful legal authority to hand a locked iPhone
containing material evidence to the NSA for cracking.  NSA hands
the phone back, locked up with timestamps undisturbed, along with
a pen drive holding the decrypted content of the device.  All of
this is done under "Top Secret, Sensitive Compartmentalized
Information" cover, as befits the work of a Double Nought Spy
service with a license to do whatever the fuck they want "to
protect and preserve America's Freedom."
Apple got a great publicity boost, Uncle got a shot at legalizing
all of the above and more, and that's the whole story of the big
public controversy.  As for the super-duper security sideshow
about how Apple uses unique hard coded keys to encrypt iPhone
contents, OK fine:  It's actually a decent system, and having the
details out there will result in a bump in sales to "security
conscious" consumers including Apple's /large/ consumer base in
the Federal sector.
Anybody who doubts that the NSA can routinely crack iPhone
encryption - when they have the physical device in hand - haven't
thought it through:  The problem is to read one number stored on
an IC chip.  We have the technology to do that, and the NSA has
the budget, facilities, mandate, and as many practice iPhones as
Apple will sell them.  They also have the resources to "borrow"
any technical documents they need from Apple, with or without
asking permission or telling Apple it happened.  iPhones are
common and reading out the contents of "locked" devices is one of
the reasons why the U.S. has a big budget technical intelligence
service.  It is more than safe to assume that reading out a locked
iPhone is a solved problem at NSA, a documented routine procedure.
 Processing the paperwork for an FBI request based on the word
"terrorism" probably took longer than cracking the iPhone.
The pretended "inability" of the FBI to obtain the contents of a
"Terrorist iPhone" was Security Theater, pure and simple.
Checking out the details of the narrative was necessary to
accurately assess the SanBerdino iPhone Massacre as Security
Theater, but that does not mean it was ever anything but that:  A
set piece show, attempting to set a precedent legalizing forced
Federal back doors in all digital devices made by vendors under
U.S. jurisdiction.

My take, just for the hell of it:
1)  At least the best known early vaccines, and today's flu
vaccines, are placebos.
This is based on British public health statistics, consistently
showing mortality attributed to contagious diseases in radical
collapse before the introduction of vaccines against same, with no
noticeable acceleration in that collapse after the introduction of
the vaccines.  Long story short:  The entire impact of sanitary
sewer systems, safer water supplies, public health policy, public
health education and improved medical treatments for contagious
illness have been attributed to vaccines.
The studies most often cited in support of the effectiveness of
flu vaccines share a methodological error which, when corrected,
eliminates the appearance that flu vaccines have any effect,
either way, on mortality stats.  Long article, well worth reading:
- -matter/307723/
or 2)  Vaccines probably do not "cause" autism.  The illusion that
they do would be present either way, as Autistim Spectrum
disorders normally become apparent as developmental delays and
atypical behaviors at about the same age children are given their
first multiple doses of vaccines.  I do think it is very likely
that vaccination triggers earlier appearance of these symptoms due
to the systemic stress of immune system overload, toxic
preservatives, etc. produced by the vaccines.
There are so many possible chemical drivers of subtle, complex,
not-understood neurological disorders like autism that singling
out one cause for an "epidemic" would require detailed studies of
comparable populations who, for instance, do and do not eat
manufactured foodlike product (anything not accurately labelled
"organic"), do and do not live in households that use novel
biochemicals daily (soaps and detergents with synthetic
components, anything "scented", etc.), do and do not live in
regions subject to major environmental toxicity, etc.  Lots of
luck getting that funded.
In summary:
Immunology is the science that tells us how vaccines should work.
 It is a very complex technical discipline, looking at massively
complex organic processes.  Any long term, motivated effort by
immunologists to produce arguments for or against the
effectiveness of vaccines should produce the desired "proofs."
Funding is only available for studies that /assume/ vaccines work.
Epidemiology is the science that can tell us whether or not
vaccines work.  It is a fairly simple and straightforward
discipline, easily understandable by any literate person who makes
the effort, and it tells us that vaccines do not work.
A possible exception:  Veterinary vaccines might actually work.
If so, only because in the process of developing them, massively
iterated "terminal experiments" are possible.  Not so with humans,
alas; all one has to go on there is "according to our PharmaChem
funded research, this /should/ work," and "hey, at least it does
not appear to kill people outright, so where's the harm?"
Personally, I don't use them.

relevant to the make, model and year of the vehicle in question will
"tell all" - or at least, tell enough - if you can access the right ones
Most paranoid motor vehicle end users (I almost said "owners," silly
me) would be quite happy with their ECM's functions, IF its radios
were silenced.  Once the physical components of those radios have been
identified, "let me count the ways" to disable them without killing
the vehicle.
And that's were a project digging out those details, doing
constructive sabotage and publishing the details and results in one

certain occasions of ‘crisis.’ In the long peace of the nineteenth
century, the military were not in the high councils of state, not

they made raids upon the state but they did not join its

"Of the three types of circle that compose the power elite today,
it is the military that has benefited the most in its enhanced
power, although the corporate circles have also become more
explicitly intrenched in the more public decision-making circles.
It is the professional politician that has lost the most, so much

Excerpt:  Mentioned this earlier, mentioning it again:
National Security and Double Government, Michael J. Glennon,
Harvard National Security Journal, 2014
"The United States has, in short, moved beyond a mere imperial
presidency to a bifurcated  system — a structure of double
government — in which even the President now exercises little
substantive control over the overall direction of U.S. national
security policy. Whereas Britain’s dual institutions evolved
towards a concealed republic, America’s have evolved in the
opposite direction, toward  greater centralization, less
accountability, and emergent autocracy."

In Central Florida in the 1960s, midwinter frost was very often
present in the morning in most open areas (think suburban yards).
By the 1980s frost was very rarely seen, and many who have lived
in the area since 2000 or so have never seen frost.  From at least
the 1960s through 1980s, seasonal hard freezes were seen during
most winters.  Since around 2000, hard freezes only happen when
major storm fronts come down from the Arctic.
In the same part of the world, a widespread and very visible
native plant called the beauty berry would produce the purple
berries it is named for in early fall, shortly after the last hot

berry is no longer a reliable predictor of the weather:  It now
produces its berries in isolated patches, across a span of about
six weeks.
I think NASA, NOAA, and about 97% of geophysicists have noticed a

 Processing the paperwork for an FBI request based on the word

The pretended "inability" of the FBI to obtain the contents of a

My take, just for the hell of it:
1)  At least the best known early vaccines, and today's flu
vaccines, are placebos.
This is based on British public health statistics, consistently
showing mortality attributed to contagious diseases in radical
collapse before the introduction of vaccines against same, with no
noticeable acceleration in that collapse after the introduction of
the vaccines.  Long story short:  The entire impact of sanitary
sewer systems, safer water supplies, public health policy, public
health education and improved medical treatments for contagious
illness have been attributed to vaccines.
The studies most often cited in support of the effectiveness of
flu vaccines share a methodological error which, when corrected,
eliminates the appearance that flu vaccines have any effect,
either way, on mortality stats.  Long article, well worth reading:
- -matter/307723/
or 2)  Vaccines probably do not "cause" autism.  The illusion that
they do would be present either way, as Autistim Spectrum
disorders normally become apparent as developmental delays and
atypical behaviors at about the same age children are given their
first multiple doses of vaccines.  I do think it is very likely
that vaccination triggers earlier appearance of these symptoms due
to the systemic stress of immune system overload, toxic
preservatives, etc. produced by the vaccines.
There are so many possible chemical drivers of subtle, complex,
not-understood neurological disorders like autism that singling
out one cause for an "epidemic" would require detailed studies of
comparable populations who, for instance, do and do not eat
manufactured foodlike product (anything not accurately labelled
"organic"), do and do not live in households that use novel
biochemicals daily (soaps and detergents with synthetic
components, anything "scented", etc.), do and do not live in
regions subject to major environmental toxicity, etc.  Lots of
luck getting that funded.
In summary:
Immunology is the science that tells us how vaccines should work.
 It is a very complex technical discipline, looking at massively
complex organic processes.  Any long term, motivated effort by
immunologists to produce arguments for or against the
effectiveness of vaccines should produce the desired "proofs."
Funding is only available for studies that /assume/ vaccines work.
Epidemiology is the science that can tell us whether or not
vaccines work.  It is a fairly simple and straightforward
discipline, easily understandable by any literate person who makes
the effort, and it tells us that vaccines do not work.
A possible exception:  Veterinary vaccines might actually work.
If so, only because in the process of developing them, massively
iterated "terminal experiments" are possible.  Not so with humans,
alas; all one has to go on there is "according to our PharmaChem
funded research, this /should/ work," and "hey, at least it does
not appear to kill people outright, so where's the harm?"
Personally, I don't use them.

I was thinking along similar lines, given that "Fuck you, I do what I want" is as good a working definition of Punk as any.  On the other hand there is the Cypher- component of the title, so herding the anarchists in that general direction topic-wise is a community service in the category of maintenance:  A thankless menial task that makes the rest Anarchy is a journey, not a destination, so there is no point at which one can hang up a "mission accomplished" banner.  But Dilbert's pointy haired boss just got orders from /his/ boss to put back doors in the company's crypto-enabled products:
Also this:
"Michael Hayden, the former head of the CIA and the NSA, thinks the US government should stop railing against encryption and should support strong crypto rather than asking for backdoors."
vs. It would not be accurate to say that the Cypherpunks have won the Crypto Wars that too is a journey, not a destination.  But damn.
Meanwhile, kicking around some of the "real world" topics that make crypto-anarchy relevant and necessary IRL seems appropriate to me, as long as the crypto- side of the equation doesn't get drowned out by the -anarchy side.  Subscribers who air their passionate ignorance on the political front serve as a reminder that propagandists see "smart people" as nothing but another demographic with exploitable weaknesses, an object lesson for all the "rebellious" folks out there.

Annual token on-topic post:
Hardware considerations are inherent to the creation and solution of
practical crypto problems, because good crypto is best solved by
attacking the platforms it runs on.  The 'internet of things' creates a
massive comms attack surface, also best solved at the platform level
i.e. signals discipline.  When the scope of a project includes
non-attribution by 3rd parties, hit and run network access via tightly
controlled hardware is the only thing that can work against a well
funded State adversary.
I don't see much about hardware hacking on CPunks. I know that folks who
have worked on digital circuit design and manufacture are lurking out
there, also a bunch of ham radio people. Things they take for granted
are utterly mysterious to lesser mortals, including "computer experts"
focused on software and networking.
Field tested cheat sheets on security oriented, low tech DIY hardware
mods are among the most subversive things that can be published on the
technical front. CPunks subscribers may or may not personally need those
docs for the Nameless Mission or Big Show in our lifetimes, but others
do need them now.

I was thinking about step by step walk-throughs on things like:
* Generic and model-specific methods of reversibly (and not) disabling
automotive ECM radio.
* Positively preventing laptop WiFi signals from being broadcast
before the MAC address has been scrambled.
* Disabling built in microphones in computers and other network
capable devices
Most of the necessary info is on the networks, IF one knows the
applicable language and which sources to focus searches on.  Right now
I don't have the time for a new project but it's on my long term to-do
list until or unless somebody else does it.  Field testing - actually
doing the things described - makes a huge usability difference,
especially when writing for end users who do not have a background in

The "black box" in recently made motor vehicles is the Electronic
Control Module, a computer usually located under the dashboard on the
passenger side, right against the firewall.  It reads sensors and runs
servos throughout the engine, and stores diagnostic error messages
about same.  Today's version of a "racing cam" is a custom chip
installed in the ECM.  A modern automotive engine can not run with its
ECM disconnected.
The ECM also accepts inputs from the driver's controls, runs the
anti-lock braking servos, and controls dashboard readouts.  Some can
even drive the car, as Michael Hastings seems to have learned the hard
In recent vehicles equipped with GPS, the receiver should normally be
integral to the ECM, as is the radio that makes push updates to ECM
software and/or hostile remote control of the vehicle possible.
Factory supported LoJack style security systems and RF door keys would
also be integral to the ECM.
Details will vary, but ECMs made by one manufacturer for all of its
vehicles are usually very similar to one another.  Maintenance manuals
relevant to the make, model and year of the vehicle in question will

I was thinking along similar lines, given that "Fuck you, I do what I want" is as good a working definition of Punk as any.  On the other hand there is the Cypher- component of the title, so herding the anarchists in that general direction topic-wise is a community service in the category of maintenance:  A thankless menial task that makes the rest Anarchy is a journey, not a destination, so there is no point at which one can hang up a "mission accomplished" banner.  But Dilbert's pointy haired boss just got orders from /his/ boss to put back doors in the company's crypto-enabled products:
Also this:
"Michael Hayden, the former head of the CIA and the NSA, thinks the US government should stop railing against encryption and should support strong crypto rather than asking for backdoors."
vs. It would not be accurate to say that the Cypherpunks have won the Crypto Wars that too is a journey, not a destination.  But damn.
Meanwhile, kicking around some of the "real world" topics that make crypto-anarchy relevant and necessary IRL seems appropriate to me, as long as the crypto- side of the equation doesn't get drowned out by the -anarchy side.  Subscribers who air their passionate ignorance on the political front serve as a reminder that propagandists see "smart people" as nothing but another demographic with exploitable weaknesses, an object lesson for all the "rebellious" folks out there.

Annual token on-topic post:
Hardware considerations are inherent to the creation and solution of
practical crypto problems, because good crypto is best solved by
attacking the platforms it runs on.  The 'internet of things' creates a
massive comms attack surface, also best solved at the platform level
i.e. signals discipline.  When the scope of a project includes
non-attribution by 3rd parties, hit and run network access via tightly

are utterly mysterious to lesser mortals, including "computer experts"

mods are among the most subversive things that can be published on the

I was thinking about step by step walk-throughs on things like:
* Generic and model-specific methods of reversibly (and not) disabling
automotive ECM radio.
* Positively preventing laptop WiFi signals from being broadcast
before the MAC address has been scrambled.
* Disabling built in microphones in computers and other network
capable devices
Most of the necessary info is on the networks, IF one knows the
applicable language and which sources to focus searches on.  Right now
I don't have the time for a new project but it's on my long term to-do
list until or unless somebody else does it.  Field testing - actually
doing the things described - makes a huge usability difference,
especially when writing for end users who do not have a background in

are trying to follow "simple" instructions.

The "black box" in recently made motor vehicles is the Electronic
Control Module, a computer usually located under the dashboard on the
passenger side, right against the firewall.  It reads sensors and runs
servos throughout the engine, and stores diagnostic error messages
about same.  Today's version of a "racing cam" is a custom chip
installed in the ECM.  A modern automotive engine can not run with its
ECM disconnected.
The ECM also accepts inputs from the driver's controls, runs the
anti-lock braking servos, and controls dashboard readouts.  Some can
even drive the car, as Michael Hastings seems to have learned the hard
In recent vehicles equipped with GPS, the receiver should normally be
integral to the ECM, as is the radio that makes push updates to ECM
software and/or hostile remote control of the vehicle possible.
Factory supported LoJack style security systems and RF door keys would
also be integral to the ECM.
Details will vary, but ECMs made by one manufacturer for all of its
vehicles are usually very similar to one another.  Maintenance manuals
relevant to the make, model and year of the vehicle in question will
"tell all" - or at least, tell enough - if you can access the right ones
Most paranoid motor vehicle end users (I almost said "owners," silly
me) would be quite happy with their ECM's functions, IF its radios
were silenced.  Once the physical components of those radios have been
identified, "let me count the ways" to disable them without killing
the vehicle.
And that's were a project digging out those details, doing
constructive sabotage and publishing the details and results in one
place for e-z user access seems like a good idea to me.

I like the generic term "syndicate" for any association of persons,
including meta-associations of groups, seeking common goals in support
of common interests.  Its vaguely ominous connotations tend to
counteract the spin doctored implications of other terminology.
The first corporate charters were in effect for a limited time, with
assigned missions to benefit the interests of the Crown or, in nominal
democracies, the public interest.  Today, corporate persons are
immortal, mutable in form and function, and "the public interest" is
broadly interpreted as economic activity of any kind.
In present usage, a corporation is a fictitious person created by
private fiat per a State-delegated "legal right," and itself has full
civil rights in matters pertaining to commerce.  Today's standard
boiler plate corporate charters specify a corporation's mission as
"all lawful purposes."
So in modern usage, a corporation is a commercial syndicate with
special privileges granted by the State.
How can one "peacefully" tear the dominant syndicates ruling an entire
civilization to pieces?  Those who own and administer those syndicates
have devoted their lives to the acquisition and retention of power, at
the expense of others and in competition against a broad spectrum of
rivals and adversaries.  The modern Democratic State exists for the
sole purpose of protecting and advancing the interests of dominant
economic syndicates and their owners by any means necessary, with
deadly force topping the go-to list.
A whole art and science of nonviolent strategic conflict addresses
methods of applying coercive social and economic measures to modify
the behavior of dominant syndicates including their State
sponsor/clients.  But an existential threat to these syndicates will
ultimately result in their application of deadly force, and a response
in kind.
Anarchy is not a proposed form of government or social order; it is an
informed critique of governments and social orders.  Or it is a
delusional belief system indoctrinated by propaganda.  Or it is
violent opposition to social order of any kind.  Depends who you ask.
If you want an anarchistic society, you will need to keep units of
sovereign governance small enough that everyone can observe and play
an active role in their governance.  You need to govern that State in
a manner that never delegates decision making power; decision making
by consensus assures that very few non-emergency decisions will be
made at all; thus, State interference in private affairs will be very
In short, you need to model your State as Bands, Tribes and Nations
governed by open Councils acting on consensus only.  And you need to
site it on a world where no other kind of State exists or can arise,
because hierarchal governance in a caste system includes efficiencies
that will enable other States to take yours over shortly after they
see advantages in doing so.  At best your Anarchistic State may
survive by imitating the organizational methods of antagonistic States
- - but then, you will no longer have an Anarchistic State.
The problem with "revolution" is semantic:  We are taught that a
revolution is an armed conflict that replaces one gang of rulers with
another gang of rulers, who may or may not bring plans for a new
social and economic structure with them.
My favorite definition of "revolution" equates it to "the world turned
upside down."
We are taught that revolutions initiate radical changes in social and
economic systems, but I maintain that revolutions are the end result
of radical changes in social and economic behavior.  We are taught
that Great Leaders with Great Ideas change the world, but I maintain
that changes in technology, population and environmental conditions
change the world:  Those Great Leaders with their Great Ideas show up
taken place.  They represent new dominant syndicates, seeking to
displace institutions of governance created by and for the exclusive
benefit of earlier dominant syndicates.  Their role is to modify the
institutions of State power to codify, control and exploit the new
order, for the sole benefit of the new dominant syndicates.
According to this model, the "shooting war" phase of a real revolution
serves the sole purpose of removing dead-end resistance to rule by new
dominant syndicates that have already eclipsed the power of previously
dominant syndicates.
The French and American Revolutions removed the institutions of
Monarchy to make way for a New World Order where insurgent Mercantile
and Industrialist factions share power with the older "landed"
Aristocracy.  That New World Order developed under Monarchy; its
revolutions only restructured political power to reflect a new
arrangement of economic powers already in place, and establish the new
dominant syndicates as its "legitimate" rulers.
No evolution, no revolution.  Unless by "revolution" one means
overthrowing the State to replace it with a new State administering
the same social and economic systems the old State evolved to control
and exploit.  In this case, revolutionaries are those who seek power
for its own sake through violent means; that is not likely to end well.
The real future includes the collapse of industrial economies,
accelerated looting of under-defended territories, and a major human
population crash.  This is the picture presented by current and
historical geophysical data.  Any plan or strategy that does not work
in this context does not work.
Absent a paradigm shift that replaces "progress" with "disaster
mitigation, management and recovery," application of political theory
and practice can only produce worse outcomes, not better ones.
My proposed solution is radical decentralization of industry and
agriculture; adaptation of "low technology" not dependent on
centralized heavy industry to replace "high technology" where and as
it has real survival value; moving as many people as far away from
population centers as possible; and distributing field tested
strategies and technologies for the above as widely as possible while
the networks and economies to do so are still up and running.
Large scale industrial processes that systematically destroy the
essential survival resources of future generations have to be halted
as soon as possible.  Hydraulic fracturing to harvest petrochemicals
permanently destroys water tables.  It is now decades too late to
"stop" global warming, but not too late to limit the rate of onset,
severity, and duration of large scale climactic disruptions on the way
to a "new normal."  Genetically engineered 'food' crops destroy
topsoil ecologies, poison water supplies and threaten the genetic
integrity of plant species necessary to large scale human survival.
The longer these and other grossly destructive industrial activities
continue, the lower the resulting long term carrying capacity for
human population in affected regions.
Preparation for and mitigation of the "end of the world as we know it"
provides more than a lifetime of challenging, satisfying, useful work.
 Any real progress in these areas will produce a better future,
sooner, for more people.
Ready?  Go!

In what I call a "real" revolution, way more than 99% of the real work
is nonviolent by nature.  Organic changes in the actual process of
social and economic life precede and drive the pressure to change
political and economic institutions rendered obsolete by changes in
the way people actually live.  Efforts expressly targeting obsolete
governing institutions for radical change are also inherently
nonviolent at their inception; only violent counter-attack by
established institutions threatened by organic change motivates public
support for armed resistance.  In turn, homegrown armed insurgencies
depend on the committed support of large networks of non-combatants
for their survival and success.
But there is a limit to the power of strictly nonviolent force;
generally speaking, policy adjustments in commercial and State
institutions can be accomplished by non-violent means, while
successful efforts to affect the abolition or radical restructuring of
commercial and State institutions usually includes armed conflict
during the endgame.  Conversion of a Liberal Fascist State and its
dominant industries to some kind of "level playing field" would be a
very radical change affecting the entire power structure that defines
commercial and State roles and activities; this is MOST unlikely to be
accomplished without prying some people's "cold, dead fingers" off the
levers of power.
Semantics:  Applying "principles for principled ways for us to
interact" is exactly what I meant by "an informed critique of
governments and social orders."  :o)
Direct Democracy a.k.a. Mob Rule is one of my favorite political
concepts; I spread its gospel, and promote it by actually doing it
every chance I get.  But resistance to onerous economic and political
governance is not, in itself, a form of governance; it is a feedback
process which, when successful, governs the governors by
counterbalancing the economic and political power of dominant
syndicates.  My version of Anarchy is the study and practice of Direct
I'll say, and how!  What I was describing is governance as practiced
by many so-called "primitive" people.
Perhaps I should have said, "If you want to go from high level
abstractions to methods that can be implemented in the real world, you
might benefit from considering historical examples."
Consider the example of Iceland, a model democracy where 1/3 million
people have recently demonstrated that self governance is possible
electorate to observe its State and Corporate institutions in action.
Iceland is fortunate in that, at present, the United States sees no
major benefit in interfering with Iceland's internal affairs:  Because
Iceland is a de facto U.S. protectorate, functionally if not
politically part of NATO.  Geographical isolation is Iceland's saving
grace, but alas, it's not one that most of the human race can duplicate.
One thing I appreciate about Anarchists is that they can fight like
cats and dogs over political bullshit, without losing an inch of
respect and solidarity.  Liberals, for instance, often don't make that
cut - which I think is very unfortunate, since "their hearts are in
the right place."
To do that we "have to" explicitly define our terms, distinguish
historical data from abstract constructs, and clearly state material
objectives to assure that our language and data are relevant to the
work at hand.
I am careful to distinguish between a "revolution" that installs a
regime that is responsive to the social and economic demands of the
people as a whole, vs. a "revolution" that installs a regime that
forcibly dictates a social and economic order to the people.  Both are
called "revolutions" but most of the resemblance ends there.
Blatantly repressive Fascist dictatorships call their rise to power
"revolutions" and their autocratic rule "democracy."
A syndicate that has become a dominant force through commercial
competition, by fair means and foul, is already waging economic war
against whatever syndicates its rise to power may inconvenience, and
vice versa.  When an emergent syndicate's growing economic power
threatens to displace syndicates who control political institutions,
overt political conflicts follow.  When the structural roots of the
conflict are sufficiently broad, deep and irreconcilable, a
"revolution" that changes the form of government to accommodate new
industrial, economic and (therefore) political and social realities
may follow.
Although such revolutions often include "shooting wars" the presence
of politically motivated gunfire is not in itself a revolution, nor a
necessary indicator of one.
War takes many forms.  Publicly funded mass murder for private profit
is only one of them.  Shutting down an industry through boycotts,
strikes and blockades is an act of economic warfare.  Destroying the
perceived legitimacy of State institutions through propaganda is an
example of political warfare.
My version of anarchist theory is a study of the dynamics of power in
human social behavior.  The State acts as a referee and enforcer in
conflicts between individuals and between syndicates, in support of
the stability of the dominant syndicates in the territory governed by
the State.  (Example:  The U.S. Federal government defines the
National Interest as the growth of the GNP and profitability of U.S.
based corporate industries.  In many policy contexts and documents,
the National Interest has replaced National Defense as the stated
beneficiary of military actions.)
As changes in technology, population and environmental variables drive
the rise and fall of dominant syndicates, stagnant or declining
syndicates may use their established relationships with the State to
cheat and take advantage, in an effort to retain their dominant
positions.  (A routine example:  Eternal Copyright and DMCA etc. for
media syndicates, conteracting the collapse to near zero of the cost
of reproducing and distributing "creative works.")  Rising syndicates
must acquire enough economic and social power to successfully
challenge both the market dominance of declining syndicates /and/ the
power of the State as it is exercised on behalf of the declining
When changes in real large scale power relationships happen, and the
State fails to adapt itself to these changes due to institutional
commitments to declining syndicates, revolution follows.
This model is exactly contrary to our cradle to grave indoctrination
in the Great Men and Great Ideas model of historical progress, where
revolutions /cause/ radical changes in the world of human affairs.  In
that context, the model I describe makes no sense at all.  But in the
context of the history of technology, it makes almost TOO much sense:
I view anarchist theory and practice as a discipline enabling the
peasant classes of society to form ad hoc syndicates that develop and
exercise social and economic power of their own.  Our rulers seem to
agree with me on this; anarchy has been suppressed by all means
available to ruling class interests since its first appearance in the
Enlightenment era.
Representative Democracy, the "authorized version" of Enlightenment
political organization, attempts to deliver power to the governed via
the electoral process.  I think we can agree that, at best, this
method does not scale well.  But as the old IWW slogan says, "Direct
action gets the goods."
Maybe I'm not expressing myself very well:  All these examples of
things I seem to "deny" are central to my view of how the world
actually works.  Cognitive dissonance may also be at work here:  I
look back at my personal struggles with political concepts and
constantly ask, "Why the hell did it take so long to figure this shit
In the world of human imagination, anything is possible because
wishing makes all things so.  In the physical world, inflexible laws
are self-enforced and can not be wished away.  In the geophysical
world, global warming is just one driver of industrial civilization's
pending collapse:
The slowing but still exponential growth of the human population is
another; the flattening curve of food production capacity and rising
curve of food demand are crossing now.  Topsoil, water, phosphates,
fuel and other essential inputs to agriculture are now approaching
peak extraction / exploitation rates.  This is in addition to, not
because of, the problems inherent in global warming.
Under these conditions the collapse of State and corporate power,
relative to their present massive extent, seems inevitable.
Opportunities for anarchists will be /very/ abundant, and Nature
itself will decide which courses of action are "right."
Back in the 1970s there was a bit of an "appropriate technology"
movement in the same geographic/cultural locus that eventually
produced those strange Cypherpunk critters.  That same gaggle of crazy
misfits got me started tracking geophysical issues way back then.
Today, alas:  But also, this and more like it:
Yup.  This here's the kind of bullshit that makes the flowers grow.

When dredging the Internet for information, I am sure you won't have
much trouble picking out the State sponsored anarchist literature and
pseudo-radical propaganda fronts:  Rebel As You Are Told is one of the
oldest and most powerful political warfare strategies in the
opposition's playbook.
Anarchists don't worry much about labeling sources and concepts as,
for instance, Left or Right.  The relevant question is, Useful or Not?
 In addition to State directed wannabe anarchists who rebel as they
are told, we also have a bumper crop of people who believe that adding
the prefix an- or anarcho- to the name of any archaic, failed or
outright delusional "political philosophy" makes it hip and relevant.
A lot of anarchist literature does not appear to be political.
Anarchists also make a point of reading and exploiting the
opposition's textbooks; there are such things as laws of physics,
natural processes, principles of strategy, etc. that hold constant no
matter who studies them.  "It's a piss poor pitiful Anarchist, who
refuses to use the State's resources against the State's interests."
Just now I am reading this:
It's an in depth survey of political warfare theory and practice in
the context of politically motivated popular uprisings.  There's not a
bit of Anarchy in it, except that everything in it is of potential use
to anarchists.  While reading just substitute self rule or autonomy
for "Democracy," and anarchist or radical for "democrat," and viola:
Radical literature fit to be suppressed by any self respecting
sovereign State.  (The U.S. Federal government tolerates and even
funds this kind of literature, because it is intended for distribution
in "unfriendly regimes" overseas.)
All of these titles are relevant to practical anarchy:

Fermi's Paradox?  Per its .com address:
"The Fermi Paradox is the apparent contradiction between the high
probability extraterrestrial civilizations' existence and the lack of
contact with such civilizations."
I don't mean to diss the "inevitable self destruction" model.  My own
conclusion is that it's in progress here and now and can not be
stopped by any human agency.  But while the end of civilization as we
know it may be unthinkable for Civilized people and institutions,
leading to the illusion that it means extinction, it is not
unsurvivable.  Humans are the toughest weeds Nature ever made, capable
of living on pack ice or dry rock desert for half the year armed only
with Neolithic technology ... and loving it.  What will the first
couple of Post Apocalyptic generations make out of the mangled
landscapes and derelict infrastructure of Civilization?  A new kind of
civilization, of course.
That thing that happened in Europe after the Black Death?  Homo Sap
ain't seen nothing yet:  This time it's global, and post-scarcity is
among the possible outcomes.
We don't see interstellar "civilizations" very often, because those
who did not get over making everything bigger and more powerful for
sake of bigness and power didn't make it.  For reals.  Some of those
gamma bursts may be industrial accidents, or Bad Outcomes to MAD based
defense strategies (an especially stupid kind of industrial accident).
If the absence of torrents of long range EM message traffic is
surprising, that's only because we presume aliens talk with strings
and tin cans "just like us."  If the absence of star drive signatures
is surprising, it's more likely that our assumptions about what those
signatures would be are faulty, than that there are no interstellar
voyagers riding the starwinds.  If the absence of physical visitors is
surprising, that just means a lot of people have not taken a hard
critical look at UFO investigations:  Failure to invade and loot or
otherwise dominate a technologically weaker species' cradle planet may
be evidence of the presence of extraterrestrial intelligence, rather
than its absence.
In my view practical anarchism is much more about developing
adaptations for conditions after the fall of Civilization, than with
making Civilization fall.  The latter task has already been done for
us gratis [not], by the Powers and Principalities of the world.

"In this paper, we present DDoSCoin, which is a cryptocurrency with a
malicious proof-of-work. DDoSCoin allows miners to prove that they
have contributed to a distributed denial of service attack against
specific target servers. This proof involves making a large number of
TLS connections to a target server, and using cryptographic responses
to prove that a large number of connections has been made. Like
proof-of-work puzzles, these proofs are inexpensive to verify, and can
be made arbitrarily difficult to solve."

As a QA and document control guy, I can't read something like that
without processing it like this:
"We are committed to transparency; therefore, everything we release is
open and our development happens in the open. Whenever feasible, we
will continue to make our source code, binaries, and claims about them
open to independent verification. In the extremely rare cases where
open development would undermine the security of our users, we will be
especially vigilant in our peer review by project members."
Translation:  We believe in and practice an open, accountable
development process, except when we don't.  The public is allowed to
see how TOR works, except when the public is not allowed to see how
TOR works.  Trust us, what you don't know won't hurt you.
"We are not just people who build software, but ambassadors for online
freedom. We want everybody in the world to understand that their human
rights -- particularly their rights to free speech, freedom to access
information, and privacy -- can be preserved when they use the Internet.
Edit to include:  The TOR project believes in human rights, except the
rights of persons accused of crimes to be held innocent until proven
guilty, and to publicly confront their accusers in a neutral, public
Court.  The TOR Project believes in and exercises the rights of
risk-averse employers to discipline and discharge victims of malicious
office gossip and/or anonymous denunciation as an expedient conflict
resolution method.
"We never intentionally mislead our users nor misrepresent the
capabilities of the tools, nor the potential risks associated with

about whether they should use a particular tool and how they should
use it."
Edit to include:  "The TOR Browser ships with NoScript installed but
disabled.  Users must enable it themselves to obtain protection
against de-anonymization at will by any malicious or compromised
website.  We do this as a convenience for naive users who may not
understand what NoScript is or what it does."

Like any other tool, the TOR Browser has strengths and weaknesses,

Lest we forget, Chelsea Manning used TOR to move massive amounts of data
to Wikileaks.  One can argue that Ed Snowden found what he was allowed
to find and shipped it to Greenwald & Co. under the approving gaze of
some compartment at NSA; Manning, not so much.  Billions of dollars
worth of damage were done to the U.S. National Interest, which is why
she rates a sentence of slow death by ritualistic torture.
This recording was never supposed to see the light of day, but it walked
right out of a tightly secured base and onto the Internet within hours:
Manning tells all, including how and why to do that thing:
She would have gotten away with it, too, if some "individual" who needs
not be named had not sold her for cheap.

The 'collateral murder' video hit Iraq during negotiations with the
3rd (?) post-conquest iteration of an allegedly sovereign Iraqi
government for continued U.S. occupation and control of Iraq.  It
pissed the Iraqi public off so badly that continued 100% immunity from
local prosecution of U.S. persons for any and all crimes including
murder was taken off the table.  In consequence of this, the U.S.
occupation force was pulled out of Iraq.  This was more than a little
inconvenient, it was bloody expensive.
The U.S. proxy force "formerly known as" ISIS have a dual mission:
West of the Syria/Iraq border, the ongoing destabilization of Syria to
prevent construction of oil & gas pipelines from Iran to a
BRICS-friendly Mediterranean seaport.  East of the border, to force
the Iraqis to allow U.S. occupation forces back in to "protect" Iraq
from an invading armed force and assure continued US/NATO control of
Iraqi oil.
The Cablegate and War Diaries releases both stirred diplomatic
anthills, complicating or terminating numerous U.S. foreign policy
operations in progress, causing direct losses on numerous fronts and
imposing global scale damage control tasks.  All of the above cost
money - a damn lot of it - and tied up human resources that would have
otherwise been very productively engaged in business as usual, i.e.
looting the planet.
Compare and contrast this impact to that of the well controlled
Snowden leak, which has caused a bit of embarrassment while serving
the practical purpose of putting the U.S. civilian population on
notice that Big Brother really is watching their every move.  On the
domestic political warfare front, State and Corporate actors would not
necessarily view this as a Bad Thing, as cultivating paranoia is one
of their long term self-defense missions.
Somebody probably located in Germany has since handed the world NSA
docs with more practical impact on U.S. espionage operations than the
whole Snowden Affair to date, and the U.S. public at large has no idea
it even happened.  Propaganda costs money and nobody on this side of
the Atlantic seems to be interested in paying for play in this case.
I would not call that a 'fact' without considering that physically
mailing storage media has its own inherent risks.  IIRC, Wikileaks'
advertised postal addresses are in "Five Eyes" territory, so nothing
will be delivered via post without e-z and unavoidable State
inspection and approval.  Arranging any physical delivery method that
might be more secure would require two-way communication in advance
with Wikileaks, so why not simplicate matters by using the same
"secure" comms channel to transmit the docs and have done with it?

Speaking of mail vs. network transport of leakish dox...
The point of failure for a mail order drugs market is the sender:
Receivers are scattered all over and at least "slightly" hard to
identify, if the network side is not breached.  But the sender's
organization is small in number and, if suspected, easy to put a mail
cover on.
The point of failure for a mailed in leaks is the receiver:  The
receiver's location(s) and personnel small in number, and easy to put
a mail cover on.  The receiver might counter this by providing mail
drops and couriers (hopefully) unknown to the opposition, which in
cases like Wikileaks would mean reliance on network security to
transmit a one-time destination address to the prospective leaker.
Again, if the network connection is "secure enough" why not just send
the dox that way?
Numerous variations are possible, of course.  I would not consider
either option a categorically superior one in /all/ cases.  When
security really matters, try to do something new and unexpected as
well as sneaky and well protected.

This is a list about the intersection of networked computing
technology and political power, and per history "anti-gov shit" is on
topic here.
The Internet is an enabler of social, economic, cultural and political
change on a scale comparable to the printing press or broadcast A/V
technology.  Whether this change moves us in the direction of a global
Orwellian State or enables scalable, resilient Direct Democracies will
be determined by the outcome of a three way war for control of the
medium:  State, Corporate and Populist interests are the major
combatants, and arming the Populists against State and Corporate
actors has been the historical mission of Cypherpunks.  Where else
will you find people who can describe and discuss:
Mathematical Munitions
The Crypto Wars
Online Anonymity
Digital Anarchy
Where I live people get propositioned or blackmailed to work as
snitches, blacklisted from employment, put on bounty lists offering
police officers rewards for /any/ trumped up criminal conviction, and
occasionally just get murdered on orders from people positioned to
obstruct criminal investigations.  Where our lords and masters fail is
in their inability to understand the concept "when you ain't got
nothing, you got nothing to lose."
At present I am reasonably OK with the content of the list:  More
technology news & discussion, especially where and as this may enable
collaborative work, education, and promotion of useful tools is always
a Good Thing.  But what makes this Cypherpunks is recognition and
discussion of the political context where network security takes
place, which in large part defines the assets defended, threat models,
and practical goals of network security.

I would differ /somewhat/ with that position.  There was an antiwar
movement - it brainwashed me, for instance.  But I would not deny that
this movement became a large scale popular 'issue' only because of the
draft:  What does not personally threaten comfortable middle class
people does not get them up on their feet and down to the street.
That's why I support compulsory military service:  It is, in effect,
the conscience of a nation.
I also observed the State's political warfare response to the anti-war
movement as it gained traction:  Sponsorship of the New Left and its
expressly Marxist, pro-war, anti-American message, promoted by
spokespuppets "Hanoi" Jane Fonda et al.
The New Left was repulsive to the vast majority of the U.S. public.
All reasonable efforts were made by network TV to exclude pacifist
messaging from the airwaves, but the New Left was presented and
promoted as a political freak show.  As it "just happened to" take
place at the same time COINTELPRO-sponsored bombings were in progress,
and provided living proof of J. Edna Hoover's assertion that anti-war
organizers were working for the Vast International Communist
Conspiracy, and received nearly unlimited free promotion via mass
media, I am confident that the New Left originated as a State
sponsored black propaganda campaign.
After the fall of Saigon, a coalition of anti-war organizations
headlined by Joan Baez took out a full page ad in the New York Times
condemning Hanoi for the purge (mass murder) in progress against
"reactionaries" in the South - anyone who had worked with the U.S. in
any capacity was subject to summary execution.  In response, a
coalition of pro-war New Left celebrities headlined by Jane Fonda took
out a full page ad congratulating Hanoi on its victory and condemning
the pacifists who dared to criticize proper revolutionary justice.
Once promoted via a full saturation propaganda campaign, the New Left
attracted ideological adherents and "grew legs" of its own.  Although
it was not viable without external support and has since declined to a
historical footnote, the New Left's influence on U.S. political
discourse neatly countered the inherently Populist a.k.a. Anarchist
influence of the anti-war movement, and helped lay the foundation for
the crypto-fascist NeoLiberal ideology and agenda that is so prominent
in U.S. politics today.
And that's all I have to say about that.

I like the generic term "syndicate" for any association of persons,
including meta-associations of groups, seeking common goals in support
of common interests.  Its vaguely ominous connotations tend to
counteract the spin doctored implications of other terminology.
The first corporate charters were in effect for a limited time, with
assigned missions to benefit the interests of the Crown or, in nominal
democracies, the public interest.  Today, corporate persons are
immortal, mutable in form and function, and "the public interest" is
broadly interpreted as economic activity of any kind.
In present usage, a corporation is a fictitious person created by
private fiat per a State-delegated "legal right," and itself has full
civil rights in matters pertaining to commerce.  Today's standard
boiler plate corporate charters specify a corporation's mission as
"all lawful purposes."
So in modern usage, a corporation is a commercial syndicate with
special privileges granted by the State.
How can one "peacefully" tear the dominant syndicates ruling an entire
civilization to pieces?  Those who own and administer those syndicates
have devoted their lives to the acquisition and retention of power, at
the expense of others and in competition against a broad spectrum of
rivals and adversaries.  The modern Democratic State exists for the
sole purpose of protecting and advancing the interests of dominant
economic syndicates and their owners by any means necessary, with
deadly force topping the go-to list.
A whole art and science of nonviolent strategic conflict addresses
methods of applying coercive social and economic measures to modify
the behavior of dominant syndicates including their State
sponsor/clients.  But an existential threat to these syndicates will
ultimately result in their application of deadly force, and a response
in kind.
Anarchy is not a proposed form of government or social order; it is an
informed critique of governments and social orders.  Or it is a
delusional belief system indoctrinated by propaganda.  Or it is
violent opposition to social order of any kind.  Depends who you ask.
If you want an anarchistic society, you will need to keep units of
sovereign governance small enough that everyone can observe and play
an active role in their governance.  You need to govern that State in
a manner that never delegates decision making power; decision making
by consensus assures that very few non-emergency decisions will be
made at all; thus, State interference in private affairs will be very
In short, you need to model your State as Bands, Tribes and Nations
governed by open Councils acting on consensus only.  And you need to
site it on a world where no other kind of State exists or can arise,
because hierarchal governance in a caste system includes efficiencies
that will enable other States to take yours over shortly after they
see advantages in doing so.  At best your Anarchistic State may
survive by imitating the organizational methods of antagonistic States
- - but then, you will no longer have an Anarchistic State.
The problem with "revolution" is semantic:  We are taught that a
revolution is an armed conflict that replaces one gang of rulers with
another gang of rulers, who may or may not bring plans for a new
social and economic structure with them.
My favorite definition of "revolution" equates it to "the world turned
upside down."
We are taught that revolutions initiate radical changes in social and
economic systems, but I maintain that revolutions are the end result
of radical changes in social and economic behavior.  We are taught
that Great Leaders with Great Ideas change the world, but I maintain
that changes in technology, population and environmental conditions
change the world:  Those Great Leaders with their Great Ideas show up
taken place.  They represent new dominant syndicates, seeking to
displace institutions of governance created by and for the exclusive
benefit of earlier dominant syndicates.  Their role is to modify the
institutions of State power to codify, control and exploit the new
order, for the sole benefit of the new dominant syndicates.
According to this model, the "shooting war" phase of a real revolution
serves the sole purpose of removing dead-end resistance to rule by new
dominant syndicates that have already eclipsed the power of previously
dominant syndicates.
The French and American Revolutions removed the institutions of
Monarchy to make way for a New World Order where insurgent Mercantile
and Industrialist factions share power with the older "landed"
Aristocracy.  That New World Order developed under Monarchy; its
revolutions only restructured political power to reflect a new
arrangement of economic powers already in place, and establish the new
dominant syndicates as its "legitimate" rulers.
No evolution, no revolution.  Unless by "revolution" one means
overthrowing the State to replace it with a new State administering
the same social and economic systems the old State evolved to control
and exploit.  In this case, revolutionaries are those who seek power
for its own sake through violent means; that is not likely to end well.
The real future includes the collapse of industrial economies,
accelerated looting of under-defended territories, and a major human
population crash.  This is the picture presented by current and
historical geophysical data.  Any plan or strategy that does not work
in this context does not work.
Absent a paradigm shift that replaces "progress" with "disaster
mitigation, management and recovery," application of political theory
and practice can only produce worse outcomes, not better ones.
My proposed solution is radical decentralization of industry and
agriculture; adaptation of "low technology" not dependent on
centralized heavy industry to replace "high technology" where and as
it has real survival value; moving as many people as far away from
population centers as possible; and distributing field tested
strategies and technologies for the above as widely as possible while
the networks and economies to do so are still up and running.
Large scale industrial processes that systematically destroy the
essential survival resources of future generations have to be halted
as soon as possible.  Hydraulic fracturing to harvest petrochemicals
permanently destroys water tables.  It is now decades too late to
"stop" global warming, but not too late to limit the rate of onset,
severity, and duration of large scale climactic disruptions on the way
to a "new normal."  Genetically engineered 'food' crops destroy
topsoil ecologies, poison water supplies and threaten the genetic
integrity of plant species necessary to large scale human survival.
The longer these and other grossly destructive industrial activities
continue, the lower the resulting long term carrying capacity for
human population in affected regions.
Preparation for and mitigation of the "end of the world as we know it"
provides more than a lifetime of challenging, satisfying, useful work.
 Any real progress in these areas will produce a better future,
sooner, for more people.
Ready?  Go!

In what I call a "real" revolution, way more than 99% of the real work
is nonviolent by nature.  Organic changes in the actual process of
social and economic life precede and drive the pressure to change
political and economic institutions rendered obsolete by changes in
the way people actually live.  Efforts expressly targeting obsolete
governing institutions for radical change are also inherently
nonviolent at their inception; only violent counter-attack by
established institutions threatened by organic change motivates public
support for armed resistance.  In turn, homegrown armed insurgencies
depend on the committed support of large networks of non-combatants
for their survival and success.
But there is a limit to the power of strictly nonviolent force;
generally speaking, policy adjustments in commercial and State
institutions can be accomplished by non-violent means, while
successful efforts to affect the abolition or radical restructuring of
commercial and State institutions usually includes armed conflict
during the endgame.  Conversion of a Liberal Fascist State and its
dominant industries to some kind of "level playing field" would be a
very radical change affecting the entire power structure that defines
commercial and State roles and activities; this is MOST unlikely to be
accomplished without prying some people's "cold, dead fingers" off the
levers of power.
Semantics:  Applying "principles for principled ways for us to
interact" is exactly what I meant by "an informed critique of
governments and social orders."  :o)
Direct Democracy a.k.a. Mob Rule is one of my favorite political
concepts; I spread its gospel, and promote it by actually doing it
every chance I get.  But resistance to onerous economic and political
governance is not, in itself, a form of governance; it is a feedback
process which, when successful, governs the governors by
counterbalancing the economic and political power of dominant
syndicates.  My version of Anarchy is the study and practice of Direct
I'll say, and how!  What I was describing is governance as practiced
by many so-called "primitive" people.
Perhaps I should have said, "If you want to go from high level
abstractions to methods that can be implemented in the real world, you
might benefit from considering historical examples."
Consider the example of Iceland, a model democracy where 1/3 million
people have recently demonstrated that self governance is possible
electorate to observe its State and Corporate institutions in action.
Iceland is fortunate in that, at present, the United States sees no
major benefit in interfering with Iceland's internal affairs:  Because
Iceland is a de facto U.S. protectorate, functionally if not
politically part of NATO.  Geographical isolation is Iceland's saving
grace, but alas, it's not one that most of the human race can duplicate.
One thing I appreciate about Anarchists is that they can fight like
cats and dogs over political bullshit, without losing an inch of
respect and solidarity.  Liberals, for instance, often don't make that
cut - which I think is very unfortunate, since "their hearts are in
the right place."
To do that we "have to" explicitly define our terms, distinguish
historical data from abstract constructs, and clearly state material
objectives to assure that our language and data are relevant to the
work at hand.
I am careful to distinguish between a "revolution" that installs a
regime that is responsive to the social and economic demands of the
people as a whole, vs. a "revolution" that installs a regime that
forcibly dictates a social and economic order to the people.  Both are
called "revolutions" but most of the resemblance ends there.
Blatantly repressive Fascist dictatorships call their rise to power
"revolutions" and their autocratic rule "democracy."
A syndicate that has become a dominant force through commercial
competition, by fair means and foul, is already waging economic war
against whatever syndicates its rise to power may inconvenience, and
vice versa.  When an emergent syndicate's growing economic power
threatens to displace syndicates who control political institutions,
overt political conflicts follow.  When the structural roots of the
conflict are sufficiently broad, deep and irreconcilable, a
"revolution" that changes the form of government to accommodate new
industrial, economic and (therefore) political and social realities
may follow.
Although such revolutions often include "shooting wars" the presence
of politically motivated gunfire is not in itself a revolution, nor a
necessary indicator of one.
War takes many forms.  Publicly funded mass murder for private profit
is only one of them.  Shutting down an industry through boycotts,
strikes and blockades is an act of economic warfare.  Destroying the
perceived legitimacy of State institutions through propaganda is an
example of political warfare.
My version of anarchist theory is a study of the dynamics of power in
human social behavior.  The State acts as a referee and enforcer in
conflicts between individuals and between syndicates, in support of
the stability of the dominant syndicates in the territory governed by
the State.  (Example:  The U.S. Federal government defines the
National Interest as the growth of the GNP and profitability of U.S.
based corporate industries.  In many policy contexts and documents,
the National Interest has replaced National Defense as the stated
beneficiary of military actions.)
As changes in technology, population and environmental variables drive
the rise and fall of dominant syndicates, stagnant or declining
syndicates may use their established relationships with the State to
cheat and take advantage, in an effort to retain their dominant
positions.  (A routine example:  Eternal Copyright and DMCA etc. for
media syndicates, conteracting the collapse to near zero of the cost
of reproducing and distributing "creative works.")  Rising syndicates
must acquire enough economic and social power to successfully
challenge both the market dominance of declining syndicates /and/ the
power of the State as it is exercised on behalf of the declining
When changes in real large scale power relationships happen, and the
State fails to adapt itself to these changes due to institutional
commitments to declining syndicates, revolution follows.
This model is exactly contrary to our cradle to grave indoctrination
in the Great Men and Great Ideas model of historical progress, where
revolutions /cause/ radical changes in the world of human affairs.  In
that context, the model I describe makes no sense at all.  But in the
context of the history of technology, it makes almost TOO much sense:
I view anarchist theory and practice as a discipline enabling the
peasant classes of society to form ad hoc syndicates that develop and
exercise social and economic power of their own.  Our rulers seem to
agree with me on this; anarchy has been suppressed by all means
available to ruling class interests since its first appearance in the
Enlightenment era.
Representative Democracy, the "authorized version" of Enlightenment
political organization, attempts to deliver power to the governed via
the electoral process.  I think we can agree that, at best, this
method does not scale well.  But as the old IWW slogan says, "Direct
action gets the goods."
Maybe I'm not expressing myself very well:  All these examples of
things I seem to "deny" are central to my view of how the world
actually works.  Cognitive dissonance may also be at work here:  I
look back at my personal struggles with political concepts and
constantly ask, "Why the hell did it take so long to figure this shit
In the world of human imagination, anything is possible because
wishing makes all things so.  In the physical world, inflexible laws
are self-enforced and can not be wished away.  In the geophysical
world, global warming is just one driver of industrial civilization's
pending collapse:
The slowing but still exponential growth of the human population is
another; the flattening curve of food production capacity and rising
curve of food demand are crossing now.  Topsoil, water, phosphates,
fuel and other essential inputs to agriculture are now approaching
peak extraction / exploitation rates.  This is in addition to, not
because of, the problems inherent in global warming.
Under these conditions the collapse of State and corporate power,
relative to their present massive extent, seems inevitable.
Opportunities for anarchists will be /very/ abundant, and Nature
itself will decide which courses of action are "right."
Back in the 1970s there was a bit of an "appropriate technology"
movement in the same geographic/cultural locus that eventually
produced those strange Cypherpunk critters.  That same gaggle of crazy
misfits got me started tracking geophysical issues way back then.
Today, alas:  But also, this and more like it:

When dredging the Internet for information, I am sure you won't have
much trouble picking out the State sponsored anarchist literature and
pseudo-radical propaganda fronts:  Rebel As You Are Told is one of the
oldest and most powerful political warfare strategies in the
opposition's playbook.
Anarchists don't worry much about labeling sources and concepts as,
for instance, Left or Right.  The relevant question is, Useful or Not?
 In addition to State directed wannabe anarchists who rebel as they
are told, we also have a bumper crop of people who believe that adding
the prefix an- or anarcho- to the name of any archaic, failed or
outright delusional "political philosophy" makes it hip and relevant.
A lot of anarchist literature does not appear to be political.
Anarchists also make a point of reading and exploiting the
opposition's textbooks; there are such things as laws of physics,
natural processes, principles of strategy, etc. that hold constant no
matter who studies them.  "It's a piss poor pitiful Anarchist, who
refuses to use the State's resources against the State's interests."
Just now I am reading this:
It's an in depth survey of political warfare theory and practice in
the context of politically motivated popular uprisings.  There's not a
bit of Anarchy in it, except that everything in it is of potential use
to anarchists.  While reading just substitute self rule or autonomy
for "Democracy," and anarchist or radical for "democrat," and viola:
Radical literature fit to be suppressed by any self respecting
sovereign State.  (The U.S. Federal government tolerates and even
funds this kind of literature, because it is intended for distribution
in "unfriendly regimes" overseas.)
All of these titles are relevant to practical anarchy:
The Tao Te Ching can rightly be called an anarchist classic.  I quote
it more often than any other source, both in correspondence and to
myself.  I like the D.C. Lau translation:

to America as soon as she was old enough and raised hell non-stop from
then on.  At the height of her career she was the most popular political
speaker in the U.S. of A.

Fermi's Paradox?  Per its .com address:
"The Fermi Paradox is the apparent contradiction between the high
probability extraterrestrial civilizations' existence and the lack of
contact with such civilizations."
I don't mean to diss the "inevitable self destruction" model.  My own
conclusion is that it's in progress here and now and can not be
stopped by any human agency.  But while the end of civilization as we
know it may be unthinkable for Civilized people and institutions,
leading to the illusion that it means extinction, it is not
unsurvivable.  Humans are the toughest weeds Nature ever made, capable
of living on pack ice or dry rock desert for half the year armed only
with Neolithic technology ... and loving it.  What will the first
couple of Post Apocalyptic generations make out of the mangled
landscapes and derelict infrastructure of Civilization?  A new kind of
civilization, of course.
That thing that happened in Europe after the Black Death?  Homo Sap
ain't seen nothing yet:  This time it's global, and post-scarcity is
among the possible outcomes.
We don't see interstellar "civilizations" very often, because those
who did not get over making everything bigger and more powerful for
sake of bigness and power didn't make it.  For reals.  Some of those
gamma bursts may be industrial accidents, or Bad Outcomes to MAD based
defense strategies (an especially stupid kind of industrial accident).
If the absence of torrents of long range EM message traffic is
surprising, that's only because we presume aliens talk with strings
and tin cans "just like us."  If the absence of star drive signatures
is surprising, it's more likely that our assumptions about what those
signatures would be are faulty, than that there are no interstellar
voyagers riding the starwinds.  If the absence of physical visitors is
surprising, that just means a lot of people have not taken a hard
critical look at UFO investigations:  Failure to invade and loot or
otherwise dominate a technologically weaker species' cradle planet may
be evidence of the presence of extraterrestrial intelligence, rather
than its absence.
In my view practical anarchism is much more about developing
adaptations for conditions after the fall of Civilization, than with
making Civilization fall.  The latter task has already been done for
us gratis [not], by the Powers and Principalities of the world.
Building the best future possible for kids born in 2150 is gonna be a

Edit to include:  The TOR project believes in human rights, except the
rights of persons accused of crimes to be held innocent until proven

The 'collateral murder' video hit Iraq during negotiations with the
3rd (?) post-conquest iteration of an allegedly sovereign Iraqi
government for continued U.S. occupation and control of Iraq.  It
pissed the Iraqi public off so badly that continued 100% immunity from
local prosecution of U.S. persons for any and all crimes including
murder was taken off the table.  In consequence of this, the U.S.
occupation force was pulled out of Iraq.  This was more than a little
inconvenient, it was bloody expensive.
The U.S. proxy force "formerly known as" ISIS have a dual mission:
West of the Syria/Iraq border, the ongoing destabilization of Syria to
prevent construction of oil & gas pipelines from Iran to a
BRICS-friendly Mediterranean seaport.  East of the border, to force
the Iraqis to allow U.S. occupation forces back in to "protect" Iraq
from an invading armed force and assure continued US/NATO control of
Iraqi oil.
The Cablegate and War Diaries releases both stirred diplomatic
anthills, complicating or terminating numerous U.S. foreign policy
operations in progress, causing direct losses on numerous fronts and
imposing global scale damage control tasks.  All of the above cost
money - a damn lot of it - and tied up human resources that would have
otherwise been very productively engaged in business as usual, i.e.
looting the planet.
Compare and contrast this impact to that of the well controlled
Snowden leak, which has caused a bit of embarrassment while serving
the practical purpose of putting the U.S. civilian population on
notice that Big Brother really is watching their every move.  On the
domestic political warfare front, State and Corporate actors would not
necessarily view this as a Bad Thing, as cultivating paranoia is one
of their long term self-defense missions.
Somebody probably located in Germany has since handed the world NSA
docs with more practical impact on U.S. espionage operations than the
whole Snowden Affair to date, and the U.S. public at large has no idea
it even happened.  Propaganda costs money and nobody on this side of
the Atlantic seems to be interested in paying for play in this case.
I would not call that a 'fact' without considering that physically
mailing storage media has its own inherent risks.  IIRC, Wikileaks'
advertised postal addresses are in "Five Eyes" territory, so nothing
will be delivered via post without e-z and unavoidable State
inspection and approval.  Arranging any physical delivery method that
might be more secure would require two-way communication in advance
with Wikileaks, so why not simplicate matters by using the same
"secure" comms channel to transmit the docs and have done with it?

Speaking of mail vs. network transport of leakish dox...
The point of failure for a mail order drugs market is the sender:
Receivers are scattered all over and at least "slightly" hard to
identify, if the network side is not breached.  But the sender's
organization is small in number and, if suspected, easy to put a mail
cover on.
The point of failure for a mailed in leaks is the receiver:  The
receiver's location(s) and personnel small in number, and easy to put
a mail cover on.  The receiver might counter this by providing mail
drops and couriers (hopefully) unknown to the opposition, which in
cases like Wikileaks would mean reliance on network security to
transmit a one-time destination address to the prospective leaker.
Again, if the network connection is "secure enough" why not just send
the dox that way?
Numerous variations are possible, of course.  I would not consider
either option a categorically superior one in /all/ cases.  When
security really matters, try to do something new and unexpected as

This is a list about the intersection of networked computing
technology and political power, and per history "anti-gov shit" is on

The Internet is an enabler of social, economic, cultural and political
change on a scale comparable to the printing press or broadcast A/V
technology.  Whether this change moves us in the direction of a global
Orwellian State or enables scalable, resilient Direct Democracies will
be determined by the outcome of a three way war for control of the

will you find people who can describe and discuss:
Mathematical Munitions
The Crypto Wars
Online Anonymity

Where I live people get propositioned or blackmailed to work as
snitches, blacklisted from employment, put on bounty lists offering
police officers rewards for /any/ trumped up criminal conviction, and
occasionally just get murdered on orders from people positioned to
obstruct criminal investigations.  Where our lords and masters fail is
in their inability to understand the concept "when you ain't got
nothing, you got nothing to lose."
At present I am reasonably OK with the content of the list:  More
technology news & discussion, especially where and as this may enable
collaborative work, education, and promotion of useful tools is always
a Good Thing.  But what makes this Cypherpunks is recognition and
discussion of the political context where network security takes
place, which in large part defines the assets defended, threat models,

I would differ /somewhat/ with that position.  There was an antiwar
movement - it brainwashed me, for instance.  But I would not deny that
this movement became a large scale popular 'issue' only because of the
draft:  What does not personally threaten comfortable middle class
people does not get them up on their feet and down to the street.
That's why I support compulsory military service:  It is, in effect,
the conscience of a nation.
I also observed the State's political warfare response to the anti-war
movement as it gained traction:  Sponsorship of the New Left and its
expressly Marxist, pro-war, anti-American message, promoted by
spokespuppets "Hanoi" Jane Fonda et al.
The New Left was repulsive to the vast majority of the U.S. public.
All reasonable efforts were made by network TV to exclude pacifist
messaging from the airwaves, but the New Left was presented and
promoted as a political freak show.  As it "just happened to" take
place at the same time COINTELPRO-sponsored bombings were in progress,
and provided living proof of J. Edna Hoover's assertion that anti-war
organizers were working for the Vast International Communist
Conspiracy, and received nearly unlimited free promotion via mass
media, I am confident that the New Left originated as a State
sponsored black propaganda campaign.
After the fall of Saigon, a coalition of anti-war organizations
headlined by Joan Baez took out a full page ad in the New York Times
condemning Hanoi for the purge (mass murder) in progress against
"reactionaries" in the South - anyone who had worked with the U.S. in
any capacity was subject to summary execution.  In response, a
coalition of pro-war New Left celebrities headlined by Jane Fonda took
out a full page ad congratulating Hanoi on its victory and condemning
the pacifists who dared to criticize proper revolutionary justice.
Once promoted via a full saturation propaganda campaign, the New Left
attracted ideological adherents and "grew legs" of its own.  Although
it was not viable without external support and has since declined to a
historical footnote, the New Left's influence on U.S. political
discourse neatly countered the inherently Populist a.k.a. Anarchist
influence of the anti-war movement, and helped lay the foundation for
the crypto-fascist NeoLiberal ideology and agenda that is so prominent
in U.S. politics today.
And that's all I have to say about that.

Technologists are likely to assume that political problems are
products of stupidity, and that putting their own kind of intelligence
in the driver's seat would automatically create optimum solutions to
all those problems.  Maybe so, but only if that intelligence is given
relevant and accurate data to work from:  Context is everything, and
in a world dominated by indoctrinated ideologies nothing is more
subversive than the facts.
The article cited in the original post is a commentary on this essay:
Wherein Brzezinski says:
"While no state is likely in the near future to match America’s
economic-financial superiority, new weapons systems could suddenly
endow some countries with the means to commit suicide in a joint
tit-for-tat embrace with the United States, or even to prevail.
Without going into speculative detail, the sudden acquisition by some
state of the capacity to render America militarily inferior would
spell the end of America’s global role. The result would most probably
be global chaos. And that is why it behooves the United States to
fashion a policy in which at least one of the two potentially
threatening states becomes a partner in the quest for regional and
then wider global stability, and thus in containing the least
predictable but potentially the most likely rival to overreach.
Currently, the more likely to overreach is Russia, but in the longer
run it could be China.
"Since the next twenty years may well be the last phase of the more
traditional and familiar political alignments with which we have grown
comfortable, the response needs to be shaped now. During the rest of
this century, humanity will also have to be increasingly preoccupied
with survival as such on account of a confluence of environmental
challenges. Those challenges can only be addressed responsibly and
effectively in a setting of increased international accommodation. And
that accommodation has to be based on a strategic vision that
recognizes the urgent need for a new geopolitical framework.
... and that's a paradigm shift, coming as it does from the man who
created Al Qaida and laid the foundation for today's business as usual
methods for regime change a.k.a. NeoColonial conquest.
We now return to our regularly scheduled Cypherpunks, a world of pure
imagination where smart people like us would rise to the top of the
social hierarchy on merit alone and fix the world, if only those
damned [scapegoat name here] would get the hell out of our way.

I like the generic term "syndicate" for any association of persons,
including meta-associations of groups, seeking common goals in support
of common interests.  Its vaguely ominous connotations tend to
counteract the spin doctored implications of other terminology.
The first corporate charters were in effect for a limited time, with
assigned missions to benefit the interests of the Crown or, in nominal
democracies, the public interest.  Today, corporate persons are
immortal, mutable in form and function, and "the public interest" is
broadly interpreted as economic activity of any kind.
In present usage, a corporation is a fictitious person created by
private fiat per a State-delegated "legal right," and itself has full
civil rights in matters pertaining to commerce.  Today's standard
boiler plate corporate charters specify a corporation's mission as
"all lawful purposes."
So in modern usage, a corporation is a commercial syndicate with
special privileges granted by the State.
How can one "peacefully" tear the dominant syndicates ruling an entire
civilization to pieces?  Those who own and administer those syndicates
have devoted their lives to the acquisition and retention of power, at
the expense of others and in competition against a broad spectrum of
rivals and adversaries.  The modern Democratic State exists for the
sole purpose of protecting and advancing the interests of dominant
economic syndicates and their owners by any means necessary, with
deadly force topping the go-to list.
A whole art and science of nonviolent strategic conflict addresses
methods of applying coercive social and economic measures to modify
the behavior of dominant syndicates including their State
sponsor/clients.  But an existential threat to these syndicates will
ultimately result in their application of deadly force, and a response
in kind.
Anarchy is not a proposed form of government or social order; it is an
informed critique of governments and social orders.  Or it is a
delusional belief system indoctrinated by propaganda.  Or it is
violent opposition to social order of any kind.  Depends who you ask.
If you want an anarchistic society, you will need to keep units of
sovereign governance small enough that everyone can observe and play
an active role in their governance.  You need to govern that State in
a manner that never delegates decision making power; decision making
by consensus assures that very few non-emergency decisions will be
made at all; thus, State interference in private affairs will be very
In short, you need to model your State as Bands, Tribes and Nations
governed by open Councils acting on consensus only.  And you need to
site it on a world where no other kind of State exists or can arise,
because hierarchal governance in a caste system includes efficiencies
that will enable other States to take yours over shortly after they
see advantages in doing so.  At best your Anarchistic State may
survive by imitating the organizational methods of antagonistic States
- - but then, you will no longer have an Anarchistic State.
The problem with "revolution" is semantic:  We are taught that a
revolution is an armed conflict that replaces one gang of rulers with
another gang of rulers, who may or may not bring plans for a new
social and economic structure with them.
My favorite definition of "revolution" equates it to "the world turned
upside down."
We are taught that revolutions initiate radical changes in social and
economic systems, but I maintain that revolutions are the end result
of radical changes in social and economic behavior.  We are taught
that Great Leaders with Great Ideas change the world, but I maintain
that changes in technology, population and environmental conditions
change the world:  Those Great Leaders with their Great Ideas show up
taken place.  They represent new dominant syndicates, seeking to
displace institutions of governance created by and for the exclusive
benefit of earlier dominant syndicates.  Their role is to modify the
institutions of State power to codify, control and exploit the new
order, for the sole benefit of the new dominant syndicates.
According to this model, the "shooting war" phase of a real revolution
serves the sole purpose of removing dead-end resistance to rule by new
dominant syndicates that have already eclipsed the power of previously
dominant syndicates.
The French and American Revolutions removed the institutions of
Monarchy to make way for a New World Order where insurgent Mercantile
and Industrialist factions share power with the older "landed"
Aristocracy.  That New World Order developed under Monarchy; its
revolutions only restructured political power to reflect a new
arrangement of economic powers already in place, and establish the new
dominant syndicates as its "legitimate" rulers.
No evolution, no revolution.  Unless by "revolution" one means
overthrowing the State to replace it with a new State administering
the same social and economic systems the old State evolved to control
and exploit.  In this case, revolutionaries are those who seek power
for its own sake through violent means; that is not likely to end well.
The real future includes the collapse of industrial economies,
accelerated looting of under-defended territories, and a major human
population crash.  This is the picture presented by current and
historical geophysical data.  Any plan or strategy that does not work
in this context does not work.
Absent a paradigm shift that replaces "progress" with "disaster
mitigation, management and recovery," application of political theory
and practice can only produce worse outcomes, not better ones.
My proposed solution is radical decentralization of industry and
agriculture; adaptation of "low technology" not dependent on
centralized heavy industry to replace "high technology" where and as
it has real survival value; moving as many people as far away from
population centers as possible; and distributing field tested
strategies and technologies for the above as widely as possible while
the networks and economies to do so are still up and running.
Large scale industrial processes that systematically destroy the
essential survival resources of future generations have to be halted
as soon as possible.  Hydraulic fracturing to harvest petrochemicals
permanently destroys water tables.  It is now decades too late to
"stop" global warming, but not too late to limit the rate of onset,
severity, and duration of large scale climactic disruptions on the way
to a "new normal."  Genetically engineered 'food' crops destroy
topsoil ecologies, poison water supplies and threaten the genetic
integrity of plant species necessary to large scale human survival.
The longer these and other grossly destructive industrial activities
continue, the lower the resulting long term carrying capacity for
human population in affected regions.
Preparation for and mitigation of the "end of the world as we know it"
provides more than a lifetime of challenging, satisfying, useful work.
 Any real progress in these areas will produce a better future,
sooner, for more people.
Ready?  Go!

In what I call a "real" revolution, way more than 99% of the real work
is nonviolent by nature.  Organic changes in the actual process of
social and economic life precede and drive the pressure to change
political and economic institutions rendered obsolete by changes in
the way people actually live.  Efforts expressly targeting obsolete
governing institutions for radical change are also inherently
nonviolent at their inception; only violent counter-attack by
established institutions threatened by organic change motivates public
support for armed resistance.  In turn, homegrown armed insurgencies
depend on the committed support of large networks of non-combatants
for their survival and success.
But there is a limit to the power of strictly nonviolent force;
generally speaking, policy adjustments in commercial and State
institutions can be accomplished by non-violent means, while
successful efforts to affect the abolition or radical restructuring of
commercial and State institutions usually includes armed conflict
during the endgame.  Conversion of a Liberal Fascist State and its
dominant industries to some kind of "level playing field" would be a
very radical change affecting the entire power structure that defines
commercial and State roles and activities; this is MOST unlikely to be
accomplished without prying some people's "cold, dead fingers" off the
levers of power.
Semantics:  Applying "principles for principled ways for us to
interact" is exactly what I meant by "an informed critique of
governments and social orders."  :o)
Direct Democracy a.k.a. Mob Rule is one of my favorite political
concepts; I spread its gospel, and promote it by actually doing it
every chance I get.  But resistance to onerous economic and political
governance is not, in itself, a form of governance; it is a feedback
process which, when successful, governs the governors by
counterbalancing the economic and political power of dominant
syndicates.  My version of Anarchy is the study and practice of Direct
I'll say, and how!  What I was describing is governance as practiced
by many so-called "primitive" people.
Perhaps I should have said, "If you want to go from high level
abstractions to methods that can be implemented in the real world, you
might benefit from considering historical examples."
Consider the example of Iceland, a model democracy where 1/3 million
people have recently demonstrated that self governance is possible
electorate to observe its State and Corporate institutions in action.
Iceland is fortunate in that, at present, the United States sees no
major benefit in interfering with Iceland's internal affairs:  Because
Iceland is a de facto U.S. protectorate, functionally if not
politically part of NATO.  Geographical isolation is Iceland's saving
grace, but alas, it's not one that most of the human race can duplicate.
One thing I appreciate about Anarchists is that they can fight like
cats and dogs over political bullshit, without losing an inch of
respect and solidarity.  Liberals, for instance, often don't make that
cut - which I think is very unfortunate, since "their hearts are in
the right place."
To do that we "have to" explicitly define our terms, distinguish
historical data from abstract constructs, and clearly state material
objectives to assure that our language and data are relevant to the
work at hand.
I am careful to distinguish between a "revolution" that installs a
regime that is responsive to the social and economic demands of the
people as a whole, vs. a "revolution" that installs a regime that
forcibly dictates a social and economic order to the people.  Both are
called "revolutions" but most of the resemblance ends there.
Blatantly repressive Fascist dictatorships call their rise to power
"revolutions" and their autocratic rule "democracy."
A syndicate that has become a dominant force through commercial
competition, by fair means and foul, is already waging economic war
against whatever syndicates its rise to power may inconvenience, and
vice versa.  When an emergent syndicate's growing economic power
threatens to displace syndicates who control political institutions,
overt political conflicts follow.  When the structural roots of the
conflict are sufficiently broad, deep and irreconcilable, a
"revolution" that changes the form of government to accommodate new
industrial, economic and (therefore) political and social realities
may follow.
Although such revolutions often include "shooting wars" the presence
of politically motivated gunfire is not in itself a revolution, nor a
necessary indicator of one.
War takes many forms.  Publicly funded mass murder for private profit
is only one of them.  Shutting down an industry through boycotts,
strikes and blockades is an act of economic warfare.  Destroying the
perceived legitimacy of State institutions through propaganda is an
example of political warfare.
My version of anarchist theory is a study of the dynamics of power in
human social behavior.  The State acts as a referee and enforcer in
conflicts between individuals and between syndicates, in support of
the stability of the dominant syndicates in the territory governed by
the State.  (Example:  The U.S. Federal government defines the
National Interest as the growth of the GNP and profitability of U.S.
based corporate industries.  In many policy contexts and documents,
the National Interest has replaced National Defense as the stated
beneficiary of military actions.)
As changes in technology, population and environmental variables drive
the rise and fall of dominant syndicates, stagnant or declining
syndicates may use their established relationships with the State to
cheat and take advantage, in an effort to retain their dominant
positions.  (A routine example:  Eternal Copyright and DMCA etc. for
media syndicates, conteracting the collapse to near zero of the cost
of reproducing and distributing "creative works.")  Rising syndicates
must acquire enough economic and social power to successfully
challenge both the market dominance of declining syndicates /and/ the
power of the State as it is exercised on behalf of the declining
When changes in real large scale power relationships happen, and the
State fails to adapt itself to these changes due to institutional
commitments to declining syndicates, revolution follows.
This model is exactly contrary to our cradle to grave indoctrination
in the Great Men and Great Ideas model of historical progress, where
revolutions /cause/ radical changes in the world of human affairs.  In
that context, the model I describe makes no sense at all.  But in the
context of the history of technology, it makes almost TOO much sense:
I view anarchist theory and practice as a discipline enabling the
peasant classes of society to form ad hoc syndicates that develop and
exercise social and economic power of their own.  Our rulers seem to
agree with me on this; anarchy has been suppressed by all means
available to ruling class interests since its first appearance in the
Enlightenment era.
Representative Democracy, the "authorized version" of Enlightenment
political organization, attempts to deliver power to the governed via
the electoral process.  I think we can agree that, at best, this
method does not scale well.  But as the old IWW slogan says, "Direct
action gets the goods."
Maybe I'm not expressing myself very well:  All these examples of
things I seem to "deny" are central to my view of how the world
actually works.  Cognitive dissonance may also be at work here:  I
look back at my personal struggles with political concepts and
constantly ask, "Why the hell did it take so long to figure this shit
In the world of human imagination, anything is possible because
wishing makes all things so.  In the physical world, inflexible laws
are self-enforced and can not be wished away.  In the geophysical
world, global warming is just one driver of industrial civilization's
pending collapse:
The slowing but still exponential growth of the human population is
another; the flattening curve of food production capacity and rising
curve of food demand are crossing now.  Topsoil, water, phosphates,
fuel and other essential inputs to agriculture are now approaching
peak extraction / exploitation rates.  This is in addition to, not
because of, the problems inherent in global warming.
Under these conditions the collapse of State and corporate power,
relative to their present massive extent, seems inevitable.
Opportunities for anarchists will be /very/ abundant, and Nature
itself will decide which courses of action are "right."
Back in the 1970s there was a bit of an "appropriate technology"
movement in the same geographic/cultural locus that eventually
produced those strange Cypherpunk critters.  That same gaggle of crazy
misfits got me started tracking geophysical issues way back then.
Today, alas:  But also, this and more like it:

When dredging the Internet for information, I am sure you won't have
much trouble picking out the State sponsored anarchist literature and
pseudo-radical propaganda fronts:  Rebel As You Are Told is one of the
oldest and most powerful political warfare strategies in the
opposition's playbook.
Anarchists don't worry much about labeling sources and concepts as,
for instance, Left or Right.  The relevant question is, Useful or Not?
 In addition to State directed wannabe anarchists who rebel as they
are told, we also have a bumper crop of people who believe that adding
the prefix an- or anarcho- to the name of any archaic, failed or
outright delusional "political philosophy" makes it hip and relevant.
A lot of anarchist literature does not appear to be political.
Anarchists also make a point of reading and exploiting the
opposition's textbooks; there are such things as laws of physics,
natural processes, principles of strategy, etc. that hold constant no
matter who studies them.  "It's a piss poor pitiful Anarchist, who
refuses to use the State's resources against the State's interests."
Just now I am reading this:
It's an in depth survey of political warfare theory and practice in
the context of politically motivated popular uprisings.  There's not a
bit of Anarchy in it, except that everything in it is of potential use
to anarchists.  While reading just substitute self rule or autonomy
for "Democracy," and anarchist or radical for "democrat," and viola:
Radical literature fit to be suppressed by any self respecting
sovereign State.  (The U.S. Federal government tolerates and even
funds this kind of literature, because it is intended for distribution
in "unfriendly regimes" overseas.)
All of these titles are relevant to practical anarchy:

Fermi's Paradox?  Per its .com address:
"The Fermi Paradox is the apparent contradiction between the high
probability extraterrestrial civilizations' existence and the lack of
contact with such civilizations."
I don't mean to diss the "inevitable self destruction" model.  My own
conclusion is that it's in progress here and now and can not be
stopped by any human agency.  But while the end of civilization as we
know it may be unthinkable for Civilized people and institutions,
leading to the illusion that it means extinction, it is not
unsurvivable.  Humans are the toughest weeds Nature ever made, capable
of living on pack ice or dry rock desert for half the year armed only
with Neolithic technology ... and loving it.  What will the first
couple of Post Apocalyptic generations make out of the mangled
landscapes and derelict infrastructure of Civilization?  A new kind of
civilization, of course.
That thing that happened in Europe after the Black Death?  Homo Sap
ain't seen nothing yet:  This time it's global, and post-scarcity is
among the possible outcomes.
We don't see interstellar "civilizations" very often, because those
who did not get over making everything bigger and more powerful for
sake of bigness and power didn't make it.  For reals.  Some of those
gamma bursts may be industrial accidents, or Bad Outcomes to MAD based
defense strategies (an especially stupid kind of industrial accident).
If the absence of torrents of long range EM message traffic is
surprising, that's only because we presume aliens talk with strings
and tin cans "just like us."  If the absence of star drive signatures
is surprising, it's more likely that our assumptions about what those
signatures would be are faulty, than that there are no interstellar
voyagers riding the starwinds.  If the absence of physical visitors is
surprising, that just means a lot of people have not taken a hard
critical look at UFO investigations:  Failure to invade and loot or
otherwise dominate a technologically weaker species' cradle planet may
be evidence of the presence of extraterrestrial intelligence, rather
than its absence.
In my view practical anarchism is much more about developing
adaptations for conditions after the fall of Civilization, than with
making Civilization fall.  The latter task has already been done for
us gratis [not], by the Powers and Principalities of the world.
Building the best future possible for kids born in 2150 is gonna be a

As a QA and document control guy, I can't read something like that
without processing it like this:
"We are committed to transparency; therefore, everything we release is
open and our development happens in the open. Whenever feasible, we
will continue to make our source code, binaries, and claims about them
open to independent verification. In the extremely rare cases where
open development would undermine the security of our users, we will be
especially vigilant in our peer review by project members."
Translation:  We believe in and practice an open, accountable
development process, except when we don't.  The public is allowed to
see how TOR works, except when the public is not allowed to see how
TOR works.  Trust us, what you don't know won't hurt you.
"We are not just people who build software, but ambassadors for online
freedom. We want everybody in the world to understand that their human
rights -- particularly their rights to free speech, freedom to access
information, and privacy -- can be preserved when they use the Internet.
Edit to include:  The TOR project believes in human rights, except the
rights of persons accused of crimes to be held innocent until proven
guilty, and to publicly confront their accusers in a neutral, public
Court.  The TOR Project believes in and exercises the rights of
risk-averse employers to discipline and discharge victims of malicious
office gossip and/or anonymous denunciation as an expedient conflict
resolution method.
"We never intentionally mislead our users nor misrepresent the
capabilities of the tools, nor the potential risks associated with
using them. Every user should be free to make an informed decision
about whether they should use a particular tool and how they should
use it."
Edit to include:  "The TOR Browser ships with NoScript installed but
disabled.  Users must enable it themselves to obtain protection
against de-anonymization at will by any malicious or compromised
website.  We do this as a convenience for naive users who may not
understand what NoScript is or what it does."
With TOR, one can have exactly as much "freedom and security" as one
can steal.  Just like real life.

Like any other tool, the TOR Browser has strengths and weaknesses,
appropriate uses and foolish/destructive uses.
Lest we forget, Chelsea Manning used TOR to move massive amounts of data
to Wikileaks.  One can argue that Ed Snowden found what he was allowed
to find and shipped it to Greenwald & Co. under the approving gaze of
some compartment at NSA; Manning, not so much.  Billions of dollars
worth of damage were done to the U.S. National Interest, which is why
she rates a sentence of slow death by ritualistic torture.
This recording was never supposed to see the light of day, but it walked
right out of a tightly secured base and onto the Internet within hours:
Manning tells all, including how and why to do that thing:
She would have gotten away with it, too, if some "individual" who needs
not be named had not sold her for cheap.
Onion routing can be a useful part of a complete operational security
toolkit.  Only when its limitations are understood and pessimistic
assumptions are made, of course.

The 'collateral murder' video hit Iraq during negotiations with the
3rd (?) post-conquest iteration of an allegedly sovereign Iraqi
government for continued U.S. occupation and control of Iraq.  It
pissed the Iraqi public off so badly that continued 100% immunity from
local prosecution of U.S. persons for any and all crimes including
murder was taken off the table.  In consequence of this, the U.S.
occupation force was pulled out of Iraq.  This was more than a little
inconvenient, it was bloody expensive.
The U.S. proxy force "formerly known as" ISIS have a dual mission:
West of the Syria/Iraq border, the ongoing destabilization of Syria to
prevent construction of oil & gas pipelines from Iran to a
BRICS-friendly Mediterranean seaport.  East of the border, to force
the Iraqis to allow U.S. occupation forces back in to "protect" Iraq
from an invading armed force and assure continued US/NATO control of
Iraqi oil.
The Cablegate and War Diaries releases both stirred diplomatic
anthills, complicating or terminating numerous U.S. foreign policy
operations in progress, causing direct losses on numerous fronts and
imposing global scale damage control tasks.  All of the above cost
money - a damn lot of it - and tied up human resources that would have
otherwise been very productively engaged in business as usual, i.e.
looting the planet.
Compare and contrast this impact to that of the well controlled
Snowden leak, which has caused a bit of embarrassment while serving
the practical purpose of putting the U.S. civilian population on
notice that Big Brother really is watching their every move.  On the
domestic political warfare front, State and Corporate actors would not
necessarily view this as a Bad Thing, as cultivating paranoia is one
of their long term self-defense missions.
Somebody probably located in Germany has since handed the world NSA
docs with more practical impact on U.S. espionage operations than the
whole Snowden Affair to date, and the U.S. public at large has no idea
it even happened.  Propaganda costs money and nobody on this side of
the Atlantic seems to be interested in paying for play in this case.
I would not call that a 'fact' without considering that physically
mailing storage media has its own inherent risks.  IIRC, Wikileaks'
advertised postal addresses are in "Five Eyes" territory, so nothing
will be delivered via post without e-z and unavoidable State
inspection and approval.  Arranging any physical delivery method that
might be more secure would require two-way communication in advance
with Wikileaks, so why not simplicate matters by using the same
"secure" comms channel to transmit the docs and have done with it?

Oh lookout-
Legitimacy implies a sanctioning Authority.
Speaking of mail vs. network transport of leakish dox...
The point of failure for a mail order drugs market is the sender:
Receivers are scattered all over and at least "slightly" hard to
identify, if the network side is not breached.  But the sender's
organization is small in number and, if suspected, easy to put a mail
cover on.
The point of failure for a mailed in leaks is the receiver:  The
receiver's location(s) and personnel small in number, and easy to put
a mail cover on.  The receiver might counter this by providing mail
drops and couriers (hopefully) unknown to the opposition, which in
cases like Wikileaks would mean reliance on network security to
transmit a one-time destination address to the prospective leaker.
Again, if the network connection is "secure enough" why not just send
the dox that way?
Numerous variations are possible, of course.  I would not consider
either option a categorically superior one in /all/ cases.  When
security really matters, try to do something new and unexpected as
well as sneaky and well protected.

"stopping" much less reversing global warming.
So far I am not aware of any positive public statements from competent

regardless of human activity.  I suspect there is a quiet consensus
that telling this particular truth would do more harm that good:  The
human contribution to global warming does continue to accelerate the

taken as excuses to just give up on reducing greenhouse gas emissions
would be counter-productive.
With or without global warming, the exponential growth of human

This is a list about the intersection of networked computing
technology and political power, and per history "anti-gov shit" is on
topic here.
The Internet is an enabler of social, economic, cultural and political
change on a scale comparable to the printing press or broadcast A/V
technology.  Whether this change moves us in the direction of a global
Orwellian State or enables scalable, resilient Direct Democracies will
be determined by the outcome of a three way war for control of the
medium:  State, Corporate and Populist interests are the major
combatants, and arming the Populists against State and Corporate
actors has been the historical mission of Cypherpunks.  Where else
will you find people who can describe and discuss:
Mathematical Munitions
The Crypto Wars
Online Anonymity
Digital Anarchy
Where I live people get propositioned or blackmailed to work as
snitches, blacklisted from employment, put on bounty lists offering
police officers rewards for /any/ trumped up criminal conviction, and
occasionally just get murdered on orders from people positioned to
obstruct criminal investigations.  Where our lords and masters fail is
in their inability to understand the concept "when you ain't got
nothing, you got nothing to lose."
At present I am reasonably OK with the content of the list:  More
technology news & discussion, especially where and as this may enable
collaborative work, education, and promotion of useful tools is always
a Good Thing.  But what makes this Cypherpunks is recognition and
discussion of the political context where network security takes
place, which in large part defines the assets defended, threat models,
and practical goals of network security.

I would differ /somewhat/ with that position.  There was an antiwar
movement - it brainwashed me, for instance.  But I would not deny that
this movement became a large scale popular 'issue' only because of the
draft:  What does not personally threaten comfortable middle class
people does not get them up on their feet and down to the street.
That's why I support compulsory military service:  It is, in effect,
the conscience of a nation.
I also observed the State's political warfare response to the anti-war
movement as it gained traction:  Sponsorship of the New Left and its
expressly Marxist, pro-war, anti-American message, promoted by
spokespuppets "Hanoi" Jane Fonda et al.
The New Left was repulsive to the vast majority of the U.S. public.
All reasonable efforts were made by network TV to exclude pacifist
messaging from the airwaves, but the New Left was presented and
promoted as a political freak show.  As it "just happened to" take
place at the same time COINTELPRO-sponsored bombings were in progress,
and provided living proof of J. Edna Hoover's assertion that anti-war
organizers were working for the Vast International Communist
Conspiracy, and received nearly unlimited free promotion via mass
media, I am confident that the New Left originated as a State
sponsored black propaganda campaign.
After the fall of Saigon, a coalition of anti-war organizations
headlined by Joan Baez took out a full page ad in the New York Times
condemning Hanoi for the purge (mass murder) in progress against
"reactionaries" in the South - anyone who had worked with the U.S. in
any capacity was subject to summary execution.  In response, a
coalition of pro-war New Left celebrities headlined by Jane Fonda took
out a full page ad congratulating Hanoi on its victory and condemning
the pacifists who dared to criticize proper revolutionary justice.
Once promoted via a full saturation propaganda campaign, the New Left
attracted ideological adherents and "grew legs" of its own.  Although
it was not viable without external support and has since declined to a
historical footnote, the New Left's influence on U.S. political
discourse neatly countered the inherently Populist a.k.a. Anarchist
influence of the anti-war movement, and helped lay the foundation for
the crypto-fascist NeoLiberal ideology and agenda that is so prominent
in U.S. politics today.
And that's all I have to say about that.

Technologists are likely to assume that political problems are
products of stupidity, and that putting their own kind of intelligence
in the driver's seat would automatically create optimum solutions to
all those problems.  Maybe so, but only if that intelligence is given
relevant and accurate data to work from:  Context is everything, and
in a world dominated by indoctrinated ideologies nothing is more
subversive than the facts.
The article cited in the original post is a commentary on this essay:
Wherein Brzezinski says:
"While no state is likely in the near future to match America’s
economic-financial superiority, new weapons systems could suddenly
endow some countries with the means to commit suicide in a joint
tit-for-tat embrace with the United States, or even to prevail.
Without going into speculative detail, the sudden acquisition by some
state of the capacity to render America militarily inferior would
spell the end of America’s global role. The result would most probably
be global chaos. And that is why it behooves the United States to
fashion a policy in which at least one of the two potentially
threatening states becomes a partner in the quest for regional and
then wider global stability, and thus in containing the least
predictable but potentially the most likely rival to overreach.
Currently, the more likely to overreach is Russia, but in the longer
run it could be China.
"Since the next twenty years may well be the last phase of the more
traditional and familiar political alignments with which we have grown
comfortable, the response needs to be shaped now. During the rest of
this century, humanity will also have to be increasingly preoccupied
with survival as such on account of a confluence of environmental
challenges. Those challenges can only be addressed responsibly and
effectively in a setting of increased international accommodation. And
that accommodation has to be based on a strategic vision that
recognizes the urgent need for a new geopolitical framework.
... and that's a paradigm shift, coming as it does from the man who
created Al Qaida and laid the foundation for today's business as usual
methods for regime change a.k.a. NeoColonial conquest.
We now return to our regularly scheduled Cypherpunks, a world of pure
imagination where smart people like us would rise to the top of the
social hierarchy on merit alone and fix the world, if only those
damned [scapegoat name here] would get the hell out of our way.

That's not a hypothetical:  It's a misperception engineered by
propaganda.  Multi-million dollar budgets are devoted to lining up as
much support as possible for the West's economically motivated
conquest of territory that happens to have Musilims walking around on
it, and exploiting racism and xenophobia is a tried and true winning
The illusion that Christians hate Muslims is an example of the
Bandwagon approach:  Lists of classic propaganda techniques always
include Bandwagon, and describe it as messaging that proves
"everybody's doing it," the it being whatever the promoter was hired
to sell.  Brining people on board is the primary objective, but
Bandwagon's includes a secondary impact when the same messaging that
seeks to unite and motivate one audience serves to turn other
audiences against them.  This greatly enhances the insular group
identities of all affected demographics, and in a political context
prepares them for mobilization against each other.
In our example, the racist Islamophobia attributed to "almost every
christian in the industrialized world" is an artifact of Bandwagon
propaganda targeting the  minority of self identifying Christians who
happen to express strong xenophobic and racist traits as native
personality features, independent of their religious beliefs.  This
minority is large enough to be dangerous if united and mobilized -
which is why extensive, expensive efforts are underway to capture and
mobilize them.
As a veteran and member in good standing of Full Gospel, Catholic,
Gnostic and Quaker faith communities, I can assure one and all that
very few of the racist xenophobes mentioned above are observant
Christians, even by the most superficial standards of performance.
The Christian mainstream recognizes and opposes the systematic
exploitation and abuse of their brand, but contrary to indoctrinated
popular belief, does not have the financial and media resources to
successfully challenge that agenda in the public arena.
I would describe the problem Christians (a.k.a. target demograhic) as
people with very legitimate grievances against the real world they
live in from day to day.  They have been systematically denied
educational resources, locked out of living wage employment, and
politically disenfranchised.  Because of these realities, they are
also strongly affected by what Alvin Toffler called "future shock,"
exceptionally vulnerable to the Good Old Days propaganda technique.
The same people who imposed poverty on their communities exploit the
resulting vulnerabilities by presenting outsiders as scapegoats, and
mobilizing them to demand that their captors be given the power and
authority to "put the world to rights," a.k.a. Make America Great
Again on their behalf.
What can we do about the resulting mess?  I'm an advocate for
outreach; get the "real Christians" up on their feet and down to the
street, not to stand against but with their wounded co-religionists.
The sidewalk talk, soap box speeches and formal sermons practically
write themselves and win at an easy walk.  Where and as the necessary
effort is made, all the uncommitted are belong to us.
What can non-Christians and the anti-religious do?  Before
enlightenment chop wood, carry water, smash the State.  After
enlightenment chop wood, carry water, smash the State.  But make sure
you know what's up and where it's at before you throw down and get it on

By their fruits shall ye know them:  Once it acquired control of the
Roman State and command of its military assets, the Church waged a war
of extermination against all competing Christian sects within striking
distance.  It was then and is now a fundamentally violent and corrupt
institution; as much a criminal enterprise as any other authoritarian
State, and more so in that its stock in trade is mind control through
deeply indoctrinated, 100% irrational guilt and fear.
I was confirmed in the Liberal Catholic Church.  Founded (and still
largely dominated) by Theosophists, LCC obtained its lineage from the
Old Dutch Catholic Church, which does not recognize the authority of
the Vatican.  The LCC practices open communion (no one turned away)
and is one of the "gay friendly" Christian denominations.
The LCC does not push a guilt-based agenda, and the text of its mass
expressly states that everyone is going to get "saved" eventually.

prove nothing.
Rationalization normally means arguing backward toward a preconceived
conclusion, in a process where logical contradictions and discarding
or misrepresenting physical data are permissible - usually to justify
or prove arbitrary and/or emotionally motivated propositions.  That
seems very much like philosophy to me.
On the other hand, the task of science is to test well defined
assertions about physical processes by attempting to falsify them with
observational data or experimental results contradicting those
assertions.  Where does hitching "reason" to the material world get

The only source for this widespread belief is an October, 2016 press

by turning his statements expressing a willingness to negotiate with
Russia into a confession that he was collaborating with a foreign enemy.
All the stories blaming Russia for the release of "hacked" e-mail

No claim of "secret evidence" in support of this speculation is made
in the press release, nor has any evidence supporting this speculation
appeared since that time.
Since the election, the assertion that Russia "rigged" the election
has been turned into a full scale Big Lie propaganda campaign by media
outlets affiliated with the Democratic National Committee.  Headline
stories across numerous media outlets agree, the CIA says Russia Did
It.  Every "new" story reports that an anonymous source says that an

The primary source for claims that Russia "interfered with" the U.S.
Presidential race is a pre-election press release from the Obama
Administration's Department of Homeland Security.  Note that this was
a press release, a.k.a. propaganda placement, not an intelligence work
product created under an audited process by an accountable activity.
This is the sum total of "evidence" presented, and it is self
evidently pure speculation:
"The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like
DCLeaks .com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are
consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed
efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with

All present claims that the CIA has confirmed this speculation follow
this template:  A reporter said an anonymous source claimed an unnamed
senior intelligence official told them that unspecified secret
information confirms Russian involvement in releasing incriminating
DNC e-mails to Wikileaks.
Before the general election, the claim of Russian State interference
with the Presidential election was only one of many talking points
used by the DNC:  A component of the effort to demonize Trump by
turning his statements expressing a willingness to negotiate with
Russia into a confession that he was collaborating with a foreign enemy.
Since the election, the assertion that Russia "rigged" the election
has been turned into a full scale Big Lie propaganda campaign led by
media outlets affiliated with the Democratic National Committee.  No
effort or expense has been spared in saturating U.S. mass media with
claims that Russia rigged the Presidential election, backed by no
evidence of any kind.  In social media venues frequented by Democratic
Party loyalists, something approaching lynch mob hysteria has emerged,
including calls to negate the election results by any means necessary
in order to protect "Democratic process."
As partisan misdirection from the Obama Administration this circus act
is brilliant:  Earlier I caught myself ignoring the fact that nobody
denies the content of the leaked documents is factual, which means
(among other things) that Hillary stole the nomination.
Meanwhile, back in the real world, investigative reporter Greg Palast
has published real evidence of good old fashioned American election
rigging.  Spoiler:  Exit polls in States under Republican
Administrations show results opposite the official counts, and follow
up indicates this was in at least some cases the result of
demographically targeted ballot rejection.

a propaganda effort to promote this factual election rigging narrative.

I found a couple of things to quibble with (left as an exercise), and
I can't say I learned anything new.  But on the whole, a good show.
This presentation is way more scary, concentrating on the collection
capabilities of top tier surveillance actors.  Although "emerging"
technologies are presented as if they were universally implemented
already, I did learn some new things:
Optimum solutions to "the end of privacy" necessarily include
embracing the recording and archiving of our lives as the normal
condition of our world.  Love it or leave it.  The "millennial
generation" gets that:
The new transparency only creates an abusive situation where and as
access to everyone's data is restricted to a small number of already
too powerful persons and agencies, who themselves are not subject to
comprehensive surveillance on demand by members of the general public.
The well controlled USIC deception operation that exploited Edward
Snowden achieved three objectives:  It put the public on notice that
they are being watched; put Congress on notice that the Security
Services break any law they want with no consequences; and the PRISM
release was timed to wipe the Manning trial all the way out of the
news.  A small corner of this operation peeks out here:
The Grugq presents operational security tips for "hacktivists," much
of which is also very applicable to less illegal forms of dissident

An interview with whom, where, and when?  The Byline is Ben Jacobs "in

presume it was not him - so the quotes from Assange have no provenance.
One prefers journalists who hide in a spotlight that makes reprisals
too costsly for hostile political operatives, to those who hide in
dark shadows - an environment already well frequented by
propagandists, spooks and other, even less trustworthy actors.
I also see the article uncritically parroting very dubious propaganda
talking points about the published DNC e-mail: "The releases were
highly damaging to Clinton, and US intelligence officials now believe
they were hacked by Russia and passed to WikiLeaks to boost Trump’s
bid for the White House."  Said what accountable person, when, where
and to whom?
The sole source for the Russia Did It canard is an October press
release from DHS that says the release is "consistent with the methods
and motivations of Russian-directed efforts."  This is attributed to
the USIC, an acronym for United States Intelligence Community.  No
such agency exists, so it is not possible for it to have an official
spokesperson, except maybe the President - their ultimate boss, at
least on paper.
That said, the Assange quotes in the article sound exactly like Mendax
to me.  Is he alive or is he dead?  Maybe the "embassy cat" some
sources mention was a gift from Erwin Schrodinger.  As a long time
fan, I think Assange's present position is a Super position.

of his productive public service output, was forcing him to sit on

Not me, and I think it's not likely that such a study will turn up any
time soon.  A study analyzing the impact of "fake news" would have to
present a defensible thesis based on begging the question, as "fake
news" is a buzzword promoted by a propaganda campaign.
As an example of actually fake news, I would cite the Big Lie that
Russia "interfered with" the election.  Numerous unsourced allegations
presented as straight news grew up around one press release from one
Department of Homeland Security dated October 7, 2016, asserting that
Russia interfered with the Presidential election.
Note that this was a press release, a.k.a. propaganda placement.  Its
content is attributed to the USIC (United States Intelligence
Community).  As there is no such agency or department, this
speculative assertion can not be attributed to any formal process or
responsible party, which confirms its status as fake news:
"The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like
DCLeaks .com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are
consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed
efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with
the US election process."
No causal link is presented connecting Russian "methods and
motivations" with disclosures "intended to interfere with the US
election process."  The statement presents an example of transfer, a
widely recognized classic propaganda technique.
Subsequent stories asserting that the CIA has confirmed this
speculation follow this template:  A reporter says an anonymous source
claimed an unnamed senior intelligence official told them that
unspecified secret information confirms Russian involvement in
releasing incriminating DNC e-mails to Wikileaks.
The Obama Administration propaganda placement blaming the leak on
Russia was a component of a larger campaign to demonize Trump by
depicting his stated willingness to negotiate with Russia as proof of
collaboration with a foreign enemy.  Post-election, it became the
rarely-cited but always referenced cornerstone of a separate campaign
asserting that the election was stolen by Russia and Trump.
The content of the leaked documents this camapign references indicates
that Clinton's DNC conspired to steal the primary from Sanders.  News
stories about "Russia interfering" never deny that the leaked
documents are authentic, because drawing any attention to their
content would defeat the diversionary purpose of the entire Big Lie
campaign:  Blame Russia, not the DNC, for handing Trump the Presidency.
The original DHS propaganda placement is the best known and most often
repeated Big Lie of the election.  But, even after showing that it
presents an example of "fake news" - a very defensible proposition -
how can an academic develop persuasive evidence that this fake news
influenced the outcome of the Presidential election?

That's not a hypothetical:  It's a misperception engineered by
propaganda.  Multi-million dollar budgets are devoted to lining up as
much support as possible for the West's economically motivated
conquest of territory that happens to have Musilims walking around on
it, and exploiting racism and xenophobia is a tried and true winning
The illusion that Christians hate Muslims is an example of the
Bandwagon approach:  Lists of classic propaganda techniques always
include Bandwagon, and describe it as messaging that proves
"everybody's doing it," the it being whatever the promoter was hired
to sell.  Brining people on board is the primary objective, but
Bandwagon's includes a secondary impact when the same messaging that
seeks to unite and motivate one audience serves to turn other
audiences against them.  This greatly enhances the insular group
identities of all affected demographics, and in a political context
prepares them for mobilization against each other.
In our example, the racist Islamophobia attributed to "almost every
christian in the industrialized world" is an artifact of Bandwagon
propaganda targeting the  minority of self identifying Christians who
happen to express strong xenophobic and racist traits as native
personality features, independent of their religious beliefs.  This
minority is large enough to be dangerous if united and mobilized -
which is why extensive, expensive efforts are underway to capture and
mobilize them.
As a veteran and member in good standing of Full Gospel, Catholic,
Gnostic and Quaker faith communities, I can assure one and all that
very few of the racist xenophobes mentioned above are observant
Christians, even by the most superficial standards of performance.
The Christian mainstream recognizes and opposes the systematic
exploitation and abuse of their brand, but contrary to indoctrinated
popular belief, does not have the financial and media resources to
successfully challenge that agenda in the public arena.
I would describe the problem Christians (a.k.a. target demograhic) as
people with very legitimate grievances against the real world they
live in from day to day.  They have been systematically denied
educational resources, locked out of living wage employment, and
politically disenfranchised.  Because of these realities, they are
also strongly affected by what Alvin Toffler called "future shock,"
exceptionally vulnerable to the Good Old Days propaganda technique.
The same people who imposed poverty on their communities exploit the
resulting vulnerabilities by presenting outsiders as scapegoats, and
mobilizing them to demand that their captors be given the power and
authority to "put the world to rights," a.k.a. Make America Great
Again on their behalf.
What can we do about the resulting mess?  I'm an advocate for
outreach; get the "real Christians" up on their feet and down to the
street, not to stand against but with their wounded co-religionists.
The sidewalk talk, soap box speeches and formal sermons practically
write themselves and win at an easy walk.  Where and as the necessary
effort is made, all the uncommitted are belong to us.
What can non-Christians and the anti-religious do?  Before
enlightenment chop wood, carry water, smash the State.  After
enlightenment chop wood, carry water, smash the State.  But make sure
you know what's up and where it's at before you throw down and get it on

By their fruits shall ye know them:  Once it acquired control of the

of extermination against all competing Christian sects within striking

institution; as much a criminal enterprise as any other authoritarian
State, and more so in that its stock in trade is mind control through
deeply indoctrinated, 100% irrational guilt and fear.
I was confirmed in the Liberal Catholic Church.  Founded (and still
largely dominated) by Theosophists, LCC obtained its lineage from the
Old Dutch Catholic Church, which does not recognize the authority of

and is one of the "gay friendly" Christian denominations.
The LCC does not push a guilt-based agenda, and the text of its mass
expressly states that everyone is going to get "saved" eventually.

DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are
consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed
efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with
the US election process."
No claim of "secret evidence" in support of this speculation is made
in the press release, nor has any evidence supporting this speculation
appeared since that time.
Since the election, the assertion that Russia "rigged" the election
has been turned into a full scale Big Lie propaganda campaign by media
outlets affiliated with the Democratic National Committee.  Headline
stories across numerous media outlets agree, the CIA says Russia Did
It.  Every "new" story reports that an anonymous source says that an
unnamed senior intelligence official told them that secret information
proves Russian involvement.

The primary source for claims that Russia "interfered with" the U.S.
Presidential race is a pre-election press release from the Obama
Administration's Department of Homeland Security.  Note that this was
a press release, a.k.a. propaganda placement, not an intelligence work
product created under an audited process by an accountable activity.
This is the sum total of "evidence" presented, and it is self
evidently pure speculation:
"The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like
DCLeaks .com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are
consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed
efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with
the US election process."
All present claims that the CIA has confirmed this speculation follow
this template:  A reporter said an anonymous source claimed an unnamed
senior intelligence official told them that unspecified secret
information confirms Russian involvement in releasing incriminating
DNC e-mails to Wikileaks.
Before the general election, the claim of Russian State interference
with the Presidential election was only one of many talking points
used by the DNC:  A component of the effort to demonize Trump by
turning his statements expressing a willingness to negotiate with
Russia into a confession that he was collaborating with a foreign enemy.
Since the election, the assertion that Russia "rigged" the election
has been turned into a full scale Big Lie propaganda campaign led by
media outlets affiliated with the Democratic National Committee.  No
effort or expense has been spared in saturating U.S. mass media with
claims that Russia rigged the Presidential election, backed by no
evidence of any kind.  In social media venues frequented by Democratic
Party loyalists, something approaching lynch mob hysteria has emerged,
including calls to negate the election results by any means necessary
in order to protect "Democratic process."
As partisan misdirection from the Obama Administration this circus act
is brilliant:  Earlier I caught myself ignoring the fact that nobody
denies the content of the leaked documents is factual, which means
(among other things) that Hillary stole the nomination.
Meanwhile, back in the real world, investigative reporter Greg Palast
has published real evidence of good old fashioned American election
rigging.  Spoiler:  Exit polls in States under Republican
Administrations show results opposite the official counts, and follow
up indicates this was in at least some cases the result of
demographically targeted ballot rejection.
Funny thing:  Nobody with the necessary budget and influence is making
a propaganda effort to promote this factual election rigging narrative.

I can't say I learned anything new.  But on the whole, a good show.
This presentation is way more scary, concentrating on the collection
capabilities of top tier surveillance actors.  Although "emerging"
technologies are presented as if they were universally implemented
already, I did learn some new things:
Optimum solutions to "the end of privacy" necessarily include
embracing the recording and archiving of our lives as the normal
condition of our world.  Love it or leave it.  The "millennial
generation" gets that:
The new transparency only creates an abusive situation where and as
access to everyone's data is restricted to a small number of already
too powerful persons and agencies, who themselves are not subject to
comprehensive surveillance on demand by members of the general public.
The well controlled USIC deception operation that exploited Edward
Snowden achieved three objectives:  It put the public on notice that
they are being watched; put Congress on notice that the Security
Services break any law they want with no consequences; and the PRISM
release was timed to wipe the Manning trial all the way out of the
news.  A small corner of this operation peeks out here:
The Grugq presents operational security tips for "hacktivists," much
of which is also very applicable to less illegal forms of dissident
political activity - especially with regard to advance planning and
coordination of activities that are likely to draw hostile attention
from police agencies and/or private sector security contractors a.k.a.

An interview with whom, where, and when?  The Byline is Ben Jacobs "in
Washington," and since he does not say who interviewed Assange, I will
presume it was not him - so the quotes from Assange have no provenance.
One prefers journalists who hide in a spotlight that makes reprisals
too costsly for hostile political operatives, to those who hide in
dark shadows - an environment already well frequented by
propagandists, spooks and other, even less trustworthy actors.
I also see the article uncritically parroting very dubious propaganda
talking points about the published DNC e-mail: "The releases were
highly damaging to Clinton, and US intelligence officials now believe
they were hacked by Russia and passed to WikiLeaks to boost Trump’s
bid for the White House."  Said what accountable person, when, where
and to whom?
The sole source for the Russia Did It canard is an October press
release from DHS that says the release is "consistent with the methods
and motivations of Russian-directed efforts."  This is attributed to
the USIC, an acronym for United States Intelligence Community.  No
such agency exists, so it is not possible for it to have an official
spokesperson, except maybe the President - their ultimate boss, at
least on paper.
That said, the Assange quotes in the article sound exactly like Mendax
to me.  Is he alive or is he dead?  Maybe the "embassy cat" some
sources mention was a gift from Erwin Schrodinger.  As a long time
fan, I think Assange's present position is a Super position.

of his productive public service output, was forcing him to sit on

Hash: SHA1
Not me, and I think it's not likely that such a study will turn up any
time soon.  A study analyzing the impact of "fake news" would have to
present a defensible thesis based on begging the question, as "fake
news" is a buzzword promoted by a propaganda campaign.
As an example of actually fake news, I would cite the Big Lie that
Russia "interfered with" the election.  Numerous unsourced allegations
presented as straight news grew up around one press release from one
Department of Homeland Security dated October 7, 2016, asserting that
Russia interfered with the Presidential election.
Note that this was a press release, a.k.a. propaganda placement.  Its
content is attributed to the USIC (United States Intelligence
Community).  As there is no such agency or department, this
speculative assertion can not be attributed to any formal process or
responsible party, which confirms its status as fake news:
"The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like
DCLeaks .com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are
consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed
efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with
the US election process."
No causal link is presented connecting Russian "methods and
motivations" with disclosures "intended to interfere with the US
election process."  The statement presents an example of transfer, a
widely recognized classic propaganda technique.
Subsequent stories asserting that the CIA has confirmed this
speculation follow this template:  A reporter says an anonymous source
claimed an unnamed senior intelligence official told them that
unspecified secret information confirms Russian involvement in
releasing incriminating DNC e-mails to Wikileaks.
The Obama Administration propaganda placement blaming the leak on
Russia was a component of a larger campaign to demonize Trump by
depicting his stated willingness to negotiate with Russia as proof of
collaboration with a foreign enemy.  Post-election, it became the
rarely-cited but always referenced cornerstone of a separate campaign
asserting that the election was stolen by Russia and Trump.
The content of the leaked documents this camapign references indicates
that Clinton's DNC conspired to steal the primary from Sanders.  News
stories about "Russia interfering" never deny that the leaked
documents are authentic, because drawing any attention to their
content would defeat the diversionary purpose of the entire Big Lie
campaign:  Blame Russia, not the DNC, for handing Trump the Presidency.
The original DHS propaganda placement is the best known and most often
repeated Big Lie of the election.  But, even after showing that it
presents an example of "fake news" - a very defensible proposition -
how can an academic develop persuasive evidence that this fake news
influenced the outcome of the Presidential election?

political failures on broken State institutions or malicious
actors wielding State power can not produce practical solutions.

As well you might:  It appears that Ted has made six posts to the

Ted and "shakeitoff have a lot in common, including
their vocabulary, grammatical construction, New Left ideology and
a hostile attitude toward what passes for "native culture" on the
CPunks list.  A few posts from years earlier suggest that Ted
probably exists somewhere in meatspace, whereas
shakeitoff appears to exist only as a pseudonym
created for a single purpose.
Our morally superior critic shakeitoff appeared to
come here to help us eliminate degrading, insulting and hurtful

One should always assume good faith on the part of correspondents,
until persuasive evidence indicates otherwise.
But apparently shakeitoff and Ted want more:

should be treated as disinformation, limited hangouts, etc. until

Whether Snowden intended to do that, or was conned into doing so

Calling evidence based analysis of the Snowden Affair "conspiracy
theory" does not make it go away.  Least of all, when the audience
understands that propagandists created the Conspiracy Theory meme
for 'name calling' purposes, to stain inconvenient information as
delusional nonsense.
Greenwald converted the Snowden documents from State secrets owned
by the U.S. government, to commercial trade secrets owned by
billionaire Pierre Omidyar.  Their new owners have published a
fraction of those documents for financial profit and, of course,
political propaganda.  I do not expect anything in those documents

or Omidyar in particular to be published.

Greenwald currently resides in Brazil.  Apparently he likes the
climate there better than in the U.S.
Not empty handed, he brought propaganda value with him:  A
no-risk, no-cost chance for Russia to both deprive the U.S. of a
military objective (Snowden's capture) and to play the champion of
justice and fair play on the world stage.  They also obtained an
extended opportunity to determine whether Snowden did have
anything of intelligence value to offer.
Snowden personally leaks nothing; never did, most likely never
will.  By the accounts of all involved parties, Snowden handed off
all copies of all them documents to Greenwald.  Greenwald then
sold the rights to them to Omidyar.  The staff at The Intercept
occasionally take out their eyedropper and deliver one or two of
these documents, along with articles explaining what say and what
they mean to the great unwashed publick.

in-house capability to analyze, troubleshoot and re-program its
own hardware, does not have the technical capability to read from
the storage media in its own devices, and lacks the engineering
staff and/or data necessary to alter Apple brand software.  In the
case of any such deficiencies, Apple (or the FBI) can hire any
required reverse-engineering done, under NDA (or gag order).
If Apple did not already do whatever was asked of them with regard
to one iPhone formerly owned by one criminal suspect, the FBI can
bring in the NSA on the basis of mere "suspicion" that the case
may have a link to non-U.S. persons.
Instead we get a legal dispute and minor media sideshow based on a
pile of false assertions by /both/ parties, apparently in
collusion, with the apparent intent of creating a legal precedent
for mandatory back doors in U.S. personal electronics - and/or

"The CIA Campaign To Steal Apple's Secrets"
By Jeremy Scahill and Josh Begley, published in The Intercept:
"These machines have two separate keys integrated into the silicon
of their Apple-designed processors at the point of manufacture.
The two, paired together, are used to encrypt data and software
stored on iPhones and iPads. One, the User ID, is unique to an
individual’s phone, and is not retained by Apple. That key is
vital to protecting an individual’s data and — particularly on
Apple’s latest devices — difficult to steal. A second key, the
Group ID, is known to Apple and is the same across multiple Apple
devices that use the same processor. The GID is used to encrypt
essential system software that runs on Apple’s mobile devices."

The QA department is not responsible to understand how the code
(or gadget) works, they are responsible to verify that it does
work, and that the "thing that worked" is the thing that ships in
the product it goes with.
Conversely, whoever designed and implemented the cryptographic
system baked into the Apple hardware in question had /better/ be
aware of how to attack it:  Otherwise, a 3rd party's job when
attempting to break the system is likely to be way too easy.
The same people who made it /do/ need to be able to inspect their
own work, especially during the initial development and
implementation process, and the tools to do so will be familiar to
them.  That makes them just the right folks to ask for advice and
assistance when it's time to develop a process for unwrapping the
package they made.
The ability to monitor the supply chain inbound to the machinist,
measure the parts the machinist makes and track them to their
final destination in a larger assembly external customer, does not
imply the ability to prescribe a specific manufacturing process,
make the part in question, or to evaluate its fitness for use for
a particular purpose.  Those latter functions, and creation of
specifications as acceptance criteria, are jobs for design and
production engineers.
Dozens who want to hire them, worldwide; hundreds who will never

Hmmm... so, a technocratic elite won't be affected, other than
perhaps to the extent of minor inconveniences, when the

those limits are not real and the only people who will be

The division of labor relevant to QA breaks down like this:
Design work is a collaboration between sales/marketing,
engineering staff and (where applicable) customer representatives.
 QA participates by documenting the process and assuring that
relevant facts are clearly communicated between these parties.  QA
does not need to understand the technical details, rather it needs
to assure that people who do understand these details agree that
they are correct per an evidence based process.
Validation work is a collaboration between engineering staff, QA
and customer representatives where applicable, with the sole
objective of assuring that prototypes and first articles of a
product performs as intended.  Again, QA does not need to
understand how the product works, only what it is supposed to do
and whether or not it does that, per the report of other
participants in the process.
Inspection/verification work is a collaboration between
engineering, production and QA staff, with the sole purpose of
assuring that components and systems do not deviate from those
that passed the validation process and were approved for production.
QA is about process:  Communication, documentation, and
facilitating timely and effective remedial action when problems
arise.  QA personnel do not "do" any part of the engineering
process; their whole mission is to facilitate reliable and
effective work by others.

I have designed and implemented ISO 9001 quality programs for

were real, the reliability of deliverables was real.
In the real world, the QA game is about compromises:  No company
is ever fully compliant; success is measured in "failure to fail"
in the real world, despite documented and undocumented variances
in QA compliance.  And of course, the ability to pass external audit
So, since when does the ability of the QA department to verify
that stuff does not crash (often) on well formed input, mean that
the QA department is qualified to reverse engineer and "break"
cryptographic protocols on demand?  That was the origin of this
whole discussion, with me on the "not QA's job" side.

Hash: SHA1
Bingo.  How fast do you want web pages to load, vs. how much do
you want it to cost to de-anonymize your traffic?
In the case of TOR, it has long appeared to me that its leading
design objectives include competing on the speed front with
unprotected networking and VPN services.  The benefits of this
competition include a larger user base = larger anonymity set.
The drawbacks include "the government that pays for TOR also has
the capability to defeat TOR."
Last time I checked, the TOR Browser ships with NoScript turned
off by default, leaving it unprotected against a large family of
side channel attacks.  This choice also looks like a convenience
for technologically naive end users, again degrading the core
security mission for the sake of a larger user base.  In this case
we do know that hostile State actors have used the deficiency to
unmask users, via a honey pot attack exploiting javascript to
phone home and report the users' IP addresses.
Leaving fill traffic on the "to do list" forever, pending the
disappearance of vocal advocates who claim that cover traffic is
not practicable - either "impossible!" or due to a perceived
head-to-head performance contest with unprotected networking -
completes the picture of a State sponsored cryptographic tool
breakable by the State that funds it (but nobody else so far).
I personally consider TOR sufficiently decent to positively lock
out routine commercial surveillance of end users.  Sufficiently
decent to provide reliable protection against NSA assets when
combined with physical OpSec, i.e. covertly using open WiFi
routers and single use disposable computers for brief one-off
sessions.  Sufficiently valuable as an NSA collection asset to
discourage routine harassment or prosecution of TOR users for
petty offenses, which would reveal to more "valuable" targets that
TOR does not protect them.
So far we are only talking about passive attacks by an actor who
can observe both ends of most TOR network connections.  More
costly active attacks could defeat /any/ anonymizing network
protocol based on onion or garlic routing protocols.  So whether
or not to "fix" TOR at the cost of alienating the bulk of its user
base due to performance issues might merit some debate.
My preferred solution:  Defund the the agencies that can and
almost certainly do defeat all current network anonymity
protocols.  My program for accomplishing this objective:  Wait.
They are hell bend on self destruction and Nature will provide.

Early on I arrived at the conclusion that "Knowing better changes
nothing."  Identifying a self defeating mental complex only
indicates a need to start programming its replacements.  Without
effective tools in hand, "knowing better" only leads to denial and
rationalization:  The higher one's verbal IQ and the broader one's
general information, the faster and better defensive self
deception works.
The Zen aphorism "Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water;
after enlightenment, chop wood, carry water" may apply here.  Even
a fundamental, revolutionary change in perceived personal identity
does not magically flush out a lifetime of beliefs, habits, and

supposedly been overturned.  Enlightenment does not stop the flow
of incoming propaganda, nor does it cancel the established
relationships and dependencies with the external world that define
a person as a social and economic entity.  That thunderous,
world-shattering AHA! moment, if it comes, will at best present a
series of new and more difficult mountains to climb.
Bob Wilson got on that particular bus sometime in the 1960s.  By
the 1980s spreading the gospel of self-deprogramming became his
major mission in life.  I have gotten a lot of mileage out of the
cognitive tools presented here:
Yesterday someone asked me for a "Cliff Notes" version of Wilson's

written works on self deprogramming.  I had to advise him that
"Cliff Notes" approaches to political and existential problems can
only make them worse...
like to define politics as the process flow of power
relationships in a society.  In this context, blaming systemic
political failures on broken State institutions or malicious
actors wielding State power can not produce practical solutions.
These problems arise mutually; neither can do its nefarious work
without the other, so repairing either allows the other to undo
the repair job - and creates an institutional memory to immunizing
the State against repetition of those repairs.

As well you might:  It appears that Ted has made six posts to the
CPunks list since June of last year.  Each consisted of complaints
about the ideological impurity a.k.a. political incorrectness of
the CPunks list and those who post to it.
Ted and "shakeitoff at ghostmail.com" have a lot in common, including
their vocabulary, grammatical construction, New Left ideology and
a hostile attitude toward what passes for "native culture" on the
CPunks list.  A few posts from years earlier suggest that Ted
probably exists somewhere in meatspace, whereas
shakeitoff at ghostmail.com appears to exist only as a pseudonym
created for a single purpose.
Our morally superior critic shakeitoff at ghostmail.com appeared to
come here to help us eliminate degrading, insulting and hurtful
language on the CPunks list by installing a censorship regime.
But now I see a New Left ideologue providing us with yet another
demonstration that "Those who make and enforce the law are above

Authoritarian much lately, shakeitoff at ghostmail.com?  No matter:
The CPunks list will not censor you.
Please cite examples of your contributions to the creation,
vetting, promotion, defense of, or end user tech support for "more

It would make sense to abandon PC trolling of the CPunks list as a
lost cause.  Most of the participants in the CPunks list self
identify as Anarchist or Libertarian, both of which indicate high
sales resistance to New Left ideology.  You will not beat a crowd

third parties do not know or care that the CPunks list exists, so
what potentially receptive audience do you address?

shakeitoff at ghostmailseriously enough to discuss them rationally.
"Counterfeit coins exist because there was, first, real gold."
One should always assume good faith on the part of correspondents,
until persuasive evidence indicates otherwise.
But apparently shakeitoff at ghostmail.com and Ted want more:
Committed ideological converts who will trash the CPunks list, an
ongoing and rather successful experiment in free speech, by
installing a shiny new censorship regime.  If "they" can't get

Accoring to Snowden, Greenwald, et al, Snowden has nothing to

That does not make their assertion true, but as far as I know, no
evidence contradicts it.
Other than Cryptome's blanket warning that /all/ leaked documents
should be treated as disinformation, limited hangouts, etc. until
or unless proven otherwise.
Whether Snowden intended to do that, or was conned into doing so
by his press contacts, remains an open question.
Calling evidence based analysis of the Snowden Affair "conspiracy
theory" does not make it go away.  Least of all, when the audience
understands that propagandists created the Conspiracy Theory meme
for 'name calling' purposes, to stain inconvenient information as
delusional nonsense.
Greenwald converted the Snowden documents from State secrets owned
by the U.S. government, to commercial trade secrets owned by
billionaire Pierre Omidyar.  Their new owners have published a
fraction of those documents for financial profit and, of course,
political propaganda.  I do not expect anything in those documents
that would have an unfavorable impact on billionaires in general
or Omidyar in particular to be published.

Neither do I.  Beliefs prejudice perception and judgement.
Because his example has already been followed by others, and more
will follow.  In politics one calls revenge "deterrence," but by
any name the U.S. government wants revenge in this matter.
Greenwald currently resides in Brazil.  Apparently he likes the
climate there better than in the U.S.
Not empty handed, he brought propaganda value with him:  A
no-risk, no-cost chance for Russia to both deprive the U.S. of a
military objective (Snowden's capture) and to play the champion of
justice and fair play on the world stage.  They also obtained an
extended opportunity to determine whether Snowden did have
anything of intelligence value to offer.
Snowden personally leaks nothing; never did, most likely never
will.  By the accounts of all involved parties, Snowden handed off
all copies of all them documents to Greenwald.  Greenwald then
sold the rights to them to Omidyar.  The staff at The Intercept
occasionally take out their eyedropper and deliver one or two of
these documents, along with articles explaining what say and what
they mean to the great unwashed publick.

Hmmm... so, a technocratic elite won't be affected, other than
perhaps to the extent of minor inconveniences, when the
exponential growth of industrialization, resource extraction and

those limits are not real and the only people who will be
adversely affected are those who have incorrect beliefs?

The division of labor relevant to QA breaks down like this:
Design work is a collaboration between sales/marketing,
engineering staff and (where applicable) customer representatives.
 QA participates by documenting the process and assuring that
relevant facts are clearly communicated between these parties.  QA
does not need to understand the technical details, rather it needs
to assure that people who do understand these details agree that
they are correct per an evidence based process.
Validation work is a collaboration between engineering staff, QA
and customer representatives where applicable, with the sole
objective of assuring that prototypes and first articles of a
product performs as intended.  Again, QA does not need to
understand how the product works, only what it is supposed to do
and whether or not it does that, per the report of other
participants in the process.
Inspection/verification work is a collaboration between
engineering, production and QA staff, with the sole purpose of
assuring that components and systems do not deviate from those
that passed the validation process and were approved for production.
QA is about process:  Communication, documentation, and
facilitating timely and effective remedial action when problems
arise.  QA personnel do not "do" any part of the engineering
process; their whole mission is to facilitate reliable and
effective work by others.

Hash: SHA1
Bingo.  How fast do you want web pages to load, vs. how much do
you want it to cost to de-anonymize your traffic?
In the case of TOR, it has long appeared to me that its leading
design objectives include competing on the speed front with
unprotected networking and VPN services.  The benefits of this
competition include a larger user base = larger anonymity set.
The drawbacks include "the government that pays for TOR also has
the capability to defeat TOR."
Last time I checked, the TOR Browser ships with NoScript turned
off by default, leaving it unprotected against a large family of
side channel attacks.  This choice also looks like a convenience
for technologically naive end users, again degrading the core
security mission for the sake of a larger user base.  In this case
we do know that hostile State actors have used the deficiency to
unmask users, via a honey pot attack exploiting javascript to
phone home and report the users' IP addresses.
Leaving fill traffic on the "to do list" forever, pending the
disappearance of vocal advocates who claim that cover traffic is
not practicable - either "impossible!" or due to a perceived
head-to-head performance contest with unprotected networking -
completes the picture of a State sponsored cryptographic tool
breakable by the State that funds it (but nobody else so far).
I personally consider TOR sufficiently decent to positively lock
out routine commercial surveillance of end users.  Sufficiently
decent to provide reliable protection against NSA assets when
combined with physical OpSec, i.e. covertly using open WiFi
routers and single use disposable computers for brief one-off
sessions.  Sufficiently valuable as an NSA collection asset to
discourage routine harassment or prosecution of TOR users for
petty offenses, which would reveal to more "valuable" targets that
TOR does not protect them.
So far we are only talking about passive attacks by an actor who
can observe both ends of most TOR network connections.  More
costly active attacks could defeat /any/ anonymizing network
protocol based on onion or garlic routing protocols.  So whether
or not to "fix" TOR at the cost of alienating the bulk of its user
base due to performance issues might merit some debate.
My preferred solution:  Defund the the agencies that can and
almost certainly do defeat all current network anonymity
protocols.  My program for accomplishing this objective:  Wait.
They are hell bend on self destruction and Nature will provide.

Early on I arrived at the conclusion that "Knowing better changes
nothing."  Identifying a self defeating mental complex only
indicates a need to start programming its replacements.  Without
effective tools in hand, "knowing better" only leads to denial and
rationalization:  The higher one's verbal IQ and the broader one's
general information, the faster and better defensive self
deception works.
The Zen aphorism "Before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water;
after enlightenment, chop wood, carry water" may apply here.  Even
a fundamental, revolutionary change in perceived personal identity
does not magically flush out a lifetime of beliefs, habits, and

a person as a social and economic entity.  That thunderous,

relationships in a society.  In this context, blaming systemic
political failures on broken State institutions or malicious
actors wielding State power can not produce practical solutions.
These problems arise mutually; neither can do its nefarious work
without the other, so repairing either allows the other to undo
the repair job - and creates an institutional memory to immunizing

As well you might:  It appears that Ted has made six posts to the

about the ideological impurity a.k.a. political incorrectness of
the CPunks list and those who post to it.
Ted and "shakeitoff at ghostmail.com" have a lot in common, including
their vocabulary, grammatical construction, New Left ideology and
a hostile attitude toward what passes for "native culture" on the
CPunks list.  A few posts from years earlier suggest that Ted
probably exists somewhere in meatspace, whereas
shakeitoff at ghostmail.com appears to exist only as a pseudonym
created for a single purpose.
Our morally superior critic shakeitoff at ghostmail.com appeared to
come here to help us eliminate degrading, insulting and hurtful
language on the CPunks list by installing a censorship regime.
But now I see a New Left ideologue providing us with yet another
demonstration that "Those who make and enforce the law are above

The CPunks list will not censor you.
Please cite examples of your contributions to the creation,
vetting, promotion, defense of, or end user tech support for "more

It would make sense to abandon PC trolling of the CPunks list as a

what potentially receptive audience do you address?

shakeitoff at ghostmailseriously enough to discuss them rationally.
"Counterfeit coins exist because there was, first, real gold."
One should always assume good faith on the part of correspondents,
until persuasive evidence indicates otherwise.

Accoring to Snowden, Greenwald, et al, Snowden has nothing to
trade for asylum:  Everyone in a position to know says that he

That does not make their assertion true, but as far as I know, no
evidence contradicts it.
Other than Cryptome's blanket warning that /all/ leaked documents
should be treated as disinformation, limited hangouts, etc. until
or unless proven otherwise.
Whether Snowden intended to do that, or was conned into doing so
by his press contacts, remains an open question.
Calling evidence based analysis of the Snowden Affair "conspiracy
theory" does not make it go away.  Least of all, when the audience
understands that propagandists created the Conspiracy Theory meme
for 'name calling' purposes, to stain inconvenient information as
delusional nonsense.
Greenwald converted the Snowden documents from State secrets owned
by the U.S. government, to commercial trade secrets owned by
billionaire Pierre Omidyar.  Their new owners have published a
fraction of those documents for financial profit and, of course,
political propaganda.  I do not expect anything in those documents
that would have an unfavorable impact on billionaires in general
or Omidyar in particular to be published.

Because his example has already been followed by others, and more
will follow.  In politics one calls revenge "deterrence," but by
any name the U.S. government wants revenge in this matter.
Greenwald currently resides in Brazil.  Apparently he likes the
climate there better than in the U.S.
Not empty handed, he brought propaganda value with him:  A
no-risk, no-cost chance for Russia to both deprive the U.S. of a
military objective (Snowden's capture) and to play the champion of
justice and fair play on the world stage.  They also obtained an
extended opportunity to determine whether Snowden did have
anything of intelligence value to offer.
Snowden personally leaks nothing; never did, most likely never
will.  By the accounts of all involved parties, Snowden handed off
all copies of all them documents to Greenwald.  Greenwald then
sold the rights to them to Omidyar.  The staff at The Intercept
occasionally take out their eyedropper and deliver one or two of
these documents, along with articles explaining what say and what
they mean to the great unwashed publick.

Insubordination is always grounds for dismissal, unless an
employee is ordered to break the law or expose him or herself to
legally banned workplace hazards.  So Apple could handle
non-cooperation problems without involving the Feds:  If we was

lucrative market all its own, just to indulge some ungrateful
non-team-player's personal snit fit?  What would Apple board
member Ronald D. Sugar, former chairman and CEO of Northrop
Grumman, say about that?
If Apple receives a Court order or lands a contract that requires
re-purposing staff, they can just hire any skill sets they don't
already have on hand.  If special NDAs or even Federal security
clearances are required, no problem:  If it's a contract matter,
the additional costs are included in the bid; if it's a Court
order, Apple can ask for and most likely receive "reasonable"
compensation for following lawful orders.
"Self destruct?"  It is to laugh.  "Can't work around it?"
These propositions only work if we assume Apple does not have an
in-house capability to analyze, troubleshoot and re-program its
own hardware, does not have the technical capability to read from
the storage media in its own devices, and lacks the engineering
staff and/or data necessary to alter Apple brand software.  In the
case of any such deficiencies, Apple (or the FBI) can hire any
required reverse-engineering done, under NDA (or gag order).
If Apple did not already do whatever was asked of them with regard
to one iPhone formerly owned by one criminal suspect, the FBI can
bring in the NSA on the basis of mere "suspicion" that the case
may have a link to non-U.S. persons.

Hmmm... so, a technocratic elite won't be affected, other than
perhaps to the extent of minor inconveniences, when the
exponential growth of industrialization, resource extraction and
human population exceeds geophysical limits?  And this, because
those limits are not real and the only people who will be
adversely affected are those who have incorrect beliefs?
That sounds almost like the narrative of commercialized Conspiracy
Theory, from a viewpoint that identifies with the "bad guys" in
that scenario.  The "good vs. evil" issue really is just a matter
of human beliefs, but the laws o' physics part is what most
interests me.  Topsoil, water, phosphates and fuel can't be wished
into existence, nor can industrial pollution, extreme weather and
a couple of billion hungry neighbors be wished out of existence.

The division of labor relevant to QA breaks down like this:
Design work is a collaboration between sales/marketing,
engineering staff and (where applicable) customer representatives.
 QA participates by documenting the process and assuring that
relevant facts are clearly communicated between these parties.  QA
does not need to understand the technical details, rather it needs
to assure that people who do understand these details agree that
they are correct per an evidence based process.
Validation work is a collaboration between engineering staff, QA
and customer representatives where applicable, with the sole
objective of assuring that prototypes and first articles of a
product performs as intended.  Again, QA does not need to
understand how the product works, only what it is supposed to do
and whether or not it does that, per the report of other
participants in the process.
Inspection/verification work is a collaboration between
engineering, production and QA staff, with the sole purpose of
assuring that components and systems do not deviate from those
that passed the validation process and were approved for production.
QA is about process:  Communication, documentation, and
facilitating timely and effective remedial action when problems
arise.  QA personnel do not "do" any part of the engineering
process; their whole mission is to facilitate reliable and
effective work by others.

Hash: SHA1
Bingo.  How fast do you want web pages to load, vs. how much do
you want it to cost to de-anonymize your traffic?
In the case of TOR, it has long appeared to me that its leading
design objectives include competing on the speed front with
unprotected networking and VPN services.  The benefits of this
competition include a larger user base = larger anonymity set.
The drawbacks include "the government that pays for TOR also has
the capability to defeat TOR."
Last time I checked, the TOR Browser ships with NoScript turned
off by default, leaving it unprotected against a large family of
side channel attacks.  This choice also looks like a convenience
for technologically naive end users, again degrading the core
security mission for the sake of a larger user base.  In this case
we do know that hostile State actors have used the deficiency to
unmask users, via a honey pot attack exploiting javascript to
phone home and report the users' IP addresses.
Leaving fill traffic on the "to do list" forever, pending the
disappearance of vocal advocates who claim that cover traffic is
not practicable - either "impossible!" or due to a perceived
head-to-head performance contest with unprotected networking -
completes the picture of a State sponsored cryptographic tool
breakable by the State that funds it (but nobody else so far).
I personally consider TOR sufficiently decent to positively lock
out routine commercial surveillance of end users.  Sufficiently
decent to provide reliable protection against NSA assets when
combined with physical OpSec, i.e. covertly using open WiFi
routers and single use disposable computers for brief one-off
sessions.  Sufficiently valuable as an NSA collection asset to
discourage routine harassment or prosecution of TOR users for
petty offenses, which would reveal to more "valuable" targets that
TOR does not protect them.
So far we are only talking about passive attacks by an actor who
can observe both ends of most TOR network connections.  More
costly active attacks could defeat /any/ anonymizing network
protocol based on onion or garlic routing protocols.  So whether
or not to "fix" TOR at the cost of alienating the bulk of its user
base due to performance issues might merit some debate.
My preferred solution:  Defund the the agencies that can and
almost certainly do defeat all current network anonymity
protocols.  My program for accomplishing this objective:  Wait.
They are hell bend on self destruction and Nature will provide.

the result of this process is the "real world," because it is the

be tested?
When our available information is second hand, ambiguous and/or
self contradictory, and especially when it originates in a context

I was very disappointed that the book in question has all the

networked communication revolution has greatly reduced the
usefulness of censorship and secrecy, and disinformation campaigns
have grown dramatically to compensate for this development. We do
need a better understanding and wider public recognition of the
theory, applications and history of black propaganda and

In social media venues where populist and/or radical political
interests are prominently represented, black propaganda in support
of State and corporate interests is rampant.  Ideological converts
who promote, defend and embellish disinformation narratives
supplied by front groups dominate many discussions.  These
campaigns do more than poison wells where factual information
suppressed in broadcast media is available.  They also damage the
image and dilute the message of populist and activist groups in
real life, by seeding their organizational meetings and public
events with ideological converts who vocally advocate for
delusional beliefs and self defeating methods.
Using black propaganda and front groups to co-opt, discredit and
neutralize populist and radical movements is an old and well
established feature of political warfare.  Adapting this strategy
to the Internet environment requires new tactics, and presents new
opportunities.  Activist groups targeted for marginalization,
division and termination by well funded adversaries need to adapt
their own techniques to counter new threats and exploit new
opportunities presented by their opponents in the network
Disinformation has inherent advantages over real information:  It
can be designed from the ground up for simplicity, emotional
appeal and behavioral impact.  Against this, truth has the
advantages of internal consistency, relevance, and appeal to a
more intelligent audience - so, when truth is attacked by
disinformation operators, it needs all the help it can get to
stand even a slight chance of propagating and affecting human

Hash: SHA1
Quite so. "Democracy" was an early casualty of the Industrial
Revolution, which concentrated unprecedented wealth and power in
the hands of industrialists.  In the United States, the issue of
collective rule by land owners vs. collective rule by factory
owners was decided by the Civil War.  Today "democracy" normally
means "deniable subversion and control by a ruling oligarchy."
Not to mention future shock.  Big decisions made today, if they
can not be implemented by next Tuesday, are likely to be
implemented in a world where their relevance is limited at best -
if they can be implemented at all.  The future itself is
recognized as an adversary by those whose interests are best
served by maintaining established power structures.
Wait, what?  I would question the possibility that 'elites' can
make any decisions in the direction of mass liberty.  If an elite
class exists, its collective interest lies in increasing the
liberties available to the elite class, at the expense of everyone
else's liberties.
Ideally the lower classes should have the 'liberty' to choose
options from a menu presented to them by their betters.  This
softens the blow of a policy regime where "everything that is not
mandatory is prohibited."  Should one faction of an elite class
appear to advocate for 'popular liberty,' they are doing so in an
effort to shift market dynamics to favor their own enterprises, at
the expense of other elite factions that will oppose any such
Of course they weighed the issues.  Doing so enables an elite
class to use its power today, to remain an elite class tomorrow.
At the outset of the Internet's exponential growth, America's
captains of corporate industry contracted their strategic advisers
- - think tanks, intelligence services, market researchers,
propaganda shops - to determine what policies and practices would
best serve their interests in the emerging Information Age.
Informed by the openly published analyses and strategic plans of
social and political activists on the early Internet (i.e. the
WELL community's 'electronic democracy' advocates), these advisers
reported that the Internet would destabilize social and political
power structures in unprecedented ways, shifting power away from
the few toward the many - much as the printing press had in an
earlier age, but on a larger scale with more immediate, agile and
adaptive impact.
Proposed solutions included mitigating the worst impacts of the
Internet on established power by making it a surveillance
platform, with unprecedented scope and depth of penetration into
the everyday lives of whole populations.  This would facilitate
faster, more effective tactical, policy and propaganda responses
to the emergence of populist power centers on the network,
partially mitigating the Internet's undesirable impacts.  So,
along with a major shift toward authoritarian governance,
consolidated broadcast propaganda platforms and accelerated
redistribution of wealth (= power) upward in the social hierarchy,
a comprehensive State and corporate surveillance regimen was
facilitated by the "open" and inherently insecure nature of its
protocols and implementations.
Early 'netizens' understood the potential of the Internet as a
force multiplier for populist political actors, and they knew that
established power blocks with a common vested interest in the
status quo would fight back.  They redoubled their efforts to
develop, refine and propagate strategies and tactics for Internet
enabled populist political action.  Technologists sympathetic to
these efforts started developing practical countermeasures to
Internet surveillance and censorship, and the rest is Cypherpunk
The meaning of "security" depends very much on context:  Whose
security, against what hostile actors?  Technologists with an
Anarchist, Libertarian or other populist political orientation
view "insecure" network protocols, software and hardware as
problems to be solved.  Political warfare assets employed by
military, law enforcement and corporate actors would call these
same features strategic and tactical assets, enabling them to
enhance the security of their employers against hostile and/or
destabilizing influences.
Occasionally, anti-security in the network infrastructure will
turn around and bite its authors in the ass - comprehensive
Chinese penetration of U.S. military contractors and the OMB
personnel records fiasco will probably stand as classic examples
for quite a while.  But occasional victories by one's adversaries
is a cost of doing business in any war, including information
warfare against one's own restive and unruly populace.  Lessons
are learned, tactics are adjusted, and the information warriors
move on to the next battle front.
We shall have a "more secure Internet" going forward.  But as long
as we do have a ruling class, we shall not have a "secure
Internet" except at the scale of darknet operations that, as their
name implies, are as secure against wide public participation as
they are against State and corporate surveillance.
I do hope the IETF and IT industries proves me at least partially
wrong, by implementing the objectives outlined in RFC 6973.  But I
believe nothing of this sort can be implemented until or unless
sufficient technical countermeasures to enable State and corporate
actors to proceed with mass surveillance and censorship as usual
are available.
Another security issue overshadows all of the above:  The role of
disinformation operations that attack the network's end users via
weaponized social psychology.  But that's a whole 'nother topic.

Quite so. "Democracy" was an early casualty of the Industrial
Revolution, which concentrated unprecedented wealth and power in
the hands of industrialists.  In the United States, the issue of
collective rule by land owners vs. collective rule by factory
owners was decided by the Civil War.  Today "democracy" normally
means "deniable subversion and control by a ruling oligarchy."
Not to mention future shock.  Big decisions made today, if they
can not be implemented by next Tuesday, are likely to be
implemented in a world where their relevance is limited at best -
if they can be implemented at all.  The future itself is
recognized as an adversary by those whose interests are best
served by maintaining established power structures.
Wait, what?  I would question the possibility that 'elites' can
make any decisions in the direction of mass liberty.  If an elite
class exists, its collective interest lies in increasing the
liberties available to the elite class, at the expense of everyone
else's liberties.
Ideally the lower classes should have the 'liberty' to choose
options from a menu presented to them by their betters.  This
softens the blow of a policy regime where "everything that is not
mandatory is prohibited."  Should one faction of an elite class
appear to advocate for 'popular liberty,' they are doing so in an
effort to shift market dynamics to favor their own enterprises, at
the expense of other elite factions that will oppose any such
Of course they weighed the issues.  Doing so enables an elite
class to use its power today, to remain an elite class tomorrow.
At the outset of the Internet's exponential growth, America's
captains of corporate industry contracted their strategic advisers
- - think tanks, intelligence services, market researchers,
propaganda shops - to determine what policies and practices would
best serve their interests in the emerging Information Age.
Informed by the openly published analyses and strategic plans of
social and political activists on the early Internet (i.e. the
WELL community's 'electronic democracy' advocates), these advisers
reported that the Internet would destabilize social and political
power structures in unprecedented ways, shifting power away from
the few toward the many - much as the printing press had in an
earlier age, but on a larger scale with more immediate, agile and
adaptive impact.
Proposed solutions included mitigating the worst impacts of the
Internet on established power by making it a surveillance
platform, with unprecedented scope and depth of penetration into
the everyday lives of whole populations.  This would facilitate
faster, more effective tactical, policy and propaganda responses
to the emergence of populist power centers on the network,
partially mitigating the Internet's undesirable impacts.  So,
along with a major shift toward authoritarian governance,
consolidated broadcast propaganda platforms and accelerated
redistribution of wealth (= power) upward in the social hierarchy,
a comprehensive State and corporate surveillance regimen was
facilitated by the "open" and inherently insecure nature of its
protocols and implementations.
Early 'netizens' understood the potential of the Internet as a
force multiplier for populist political actors, and they knew that
established power blocks with a common vested interest in the
status quo would fight back.  They redoubled their efforts to
develop, refine and propagate strategies and tactics for Internet
enabled populist political action.  Technologists sympathetic to
these efforts started developing practical countermeasures to
Internet surveillance and censorship, and the rest is Cypherpunk
The meaning of "security" depends very much on context:  Whose
security, against what hostile actors?  Technologists with an
Anarchist, Libertarian or other populist political orientation
view "insecure" network protocols, software and hardware as
problems to be solved.  Political warfare assets employed by
military, law enforcement and corporate actors would call these
same features strategic and tactical assets, enabling them to
enhance the security of their employers against hostile and/or
destabilizing influences.
Occasionally, anti-security in the network infrastructure will
turn around and bite its authors in the ass - comprehensive
Chinese penetration of U.S. military contractors and the OMB
personnel records fiasco will probably stand as classic examples
for quite a while.  But occasional victories by one's adversaries
is a cost of doing business in any war, including information
warfare against one's own restive and unruly populace.  Lessons
are learned, tactics are adjusted, and the information warriors
move on to the next battle front.
We shall have a "more secure Internet" going forward.  But as long
as we do have a ruling class, we shall not have a "secure
Internet" except at the scale of darknet operations that, as their
name implies, are as secure against wide public participation as
they are against State and corporate surveillance.
I do hope the IETF and IT industries proves me at least partially
wrong, by implementing the objectives outlined in RFC 6973.  But I
believe nothing of this sort can be implemented until or unless
sufficient technical countermeasures to enable State and corporate
actors to proceed with mass surveillance and censorship as usual
are available.
Another security issue overshadows all of the above:  The role of
disinformation operations that attack the network's end users via
weaponized social psychology.  But that's a whole 'nother topic.

It seems to be working OK here so far.  Ain't broke, don't fix it.
 If you don't like it, go elsewhere; anarchy ain't for everybody.
In re FLOSS development and its social infrastructure:
In any healthy and productive engineering shop, physical or
virtual, outside observers who assume that a primate pecking order
defines and governs /all/ human social roles and behaviors may be
forgiven for seeing a "meritocracy" where none exists.  In a
healthy, productive engineering shop, anyone who contributes to
the practical objectives of the project is valued as a team member
and encouraged to continue doing so.  Those who are in a position
to make large and highly visible contributions may thereby become
"popular" but this does not confer authority on them, and is not
an obstacle to anyone else's contributions.
Of course there are dysfunctional engineering shops, commercial
and non-commercial.  Introducing policies requiring the
participants in a toxic work environment promise to play nice, and
promise to punish those who do not, would only compound existing
abuses of power by adding a fresh layer of passive aggressive
posturing and manipulation.

The controversial post that started this discussion directly
quotes the key messaging of current campaigns for the restraint of
speech and enforcement of racial and gender quotas, especially
targeting college campuses - now also targeting collaborative
software development projects, their mailing lists and even CPunks.
Does this phenomenon represent spontaneous demands for justice
arising from the awakening social conscience of Amerika's best and
brightest, or a black propaganda campaign working to drive wedges
between dissident factions and demographics?  I do not think it
matters.  I think the functional consequences of that campaign and
the response it elicits do matter.
Crypto-Anarchy has an inherent agenda of enabling populist
political resistance, organization and uprisings.  To whatever
extent this agenda could find applications in real life, it merits
hostile attention from State sponsored actors.  Depicting the
CPunk and Hacker communities as gangs of racist misogynists, and
prodding them in ways designed to provoke open mockery of any such
concerns, makes strategic sense in this context.
It always pays to outclass the opposition, in word /and/ deed.
Trolls, Buffoons and Lunaticks have their uses and some get paid;
but they have no staying power and eventually land on the rubbish
heap.  It is said that a wise person may choose to act like a

"Everybody lies." - Greg House
First and foremost we lie to ourselves, continuously, as our
central nervous systems build models of the world based on
incomplete data and unexamined assumptions.  We usually believe
the result of this process is the "real world," because it is the
only world we can experience.  We have to believe, because the
processing overhead of questioning and testing everything, all the
time, would be crippling - and the results would be inconclusive.
But there is a limit to the advantage of taking our illusory
impressions of the real world at face value, and sometimes it does
pay to consciously examine how confident we are of a source of
information, why we have that confidence, and how these factors
should affect own conclusions about that information.  What
evidence do we really have, where did it come from and how can it
be tested?
When our available information is second hand, ambiguous and/or
self contradictory, and especially when it originates in a context
of human conflict, there may be no rational basis for confident
conclusions about what really happened:  Just a cluster of
possible interpretations which can be assigned higher or lower
probability on a basis of educated guesswork about the quality of
the sources and how the information itself fits - or does not fit
- - into what we already 'know' about its native context.
People who do this for a living are called intelligence analysts,
and their training includes all of the above.  When the going gets
spooky, the spooks his the books.  Highly recommended for anyone
who takes an interest in news and current events:
Subjective human experience is the instrument that detects and
represents "reality," so it pays to have a handle on how that
system works.  I doubt that the CIA requires trainees to read and

make any decisions in the direction of mass liberty.  If an elite
class exists, its collective interest lies in increasing the
liberties available to the elite class, at the expense of everyone
else's liberties.
Ideally the lower classes should have the 'liberty' to choose
options from a menu presented to them by their betters.  This
softens the blow of a policy regime where "everything that is not
mandatory is prohibited."  Should one faction of an elite class
appear to advocate for 'popular liberty,' they are doing so in an
effort to shift market dynamics to favor their own enterprises, at
the expense of other elite factions that will oppose any such
Of course they weighed the issues.  Doing so enables an elite
class to use its power today, to remain an elite class tomorrow.
At the outset of the Internet's exponential growth, America's
captains of corporate industry contracted their strategic advisers
- - think tanks, intelligence services, market researchers,
propaganda shops - to determine what policies and practices would
best serve their interests in the emerging Information Age.
Informed by the openly published analyses and strategic plans of
social and political activists on the early Internet (i.e. the
WELL community's 'electronic democracy' advocates), these advisers
reported that the Internet would destabilize social and political
power structures in unprecedented ways, shifting power away from
the few toward the many - much as the printing press had in an
earlier age, but on a larger scale with more immediate, agile and
adaptive impact.
Proposed solutions included mitigating the worst impacts of the
Internet on established power by making it a surveillance
platform, with unprecedented scope and depth of penetration into
the everyday lives of whole populations.  This would facilitate
faster, more effective tactical, policy and propaganda responses
to the emergence of populist power centers on the network,
partially mitigating the Internet's undesirable impacts.  So,
along with a major shift toward authoritarian governance,
consolidated broadcast propaganda platforms and accelerated
redistribution of wealth (= power) upward in the social hierarchy,
a comprehensive State and corporate surveillance regimen was
facilitated by the "open" and inherently insecure nature of its
protocols and implementations.
Early 'netizens' understood the potential of the Internet as a
force multiplier for populist political actors, and they knew that
established power blocks with a common vested interest in the
status quo would fight back.  They redoubled their efforts to
develop, refine and propagate strategies and tactics for Internet
enabled populist political action.  Technologists sympathetic to
these efforts started developing practical countermeasures to
Internet surveillance and censorship, and the rest is Cypherpunk
The meaning of "security" depends very much on context:  Whose
security, against what hostile actors?  Technologists with an
Anarchist, Libertarian or other populist political orientation
view "insecure" network protocols, software and hardware as
problems to be solved.  Political warfare assets employed by
military, law enforcement and corporate actors would call these
same features strategic and tactical assets, enabling them to
enhance the security of their employers against hostile and/or
destabilizing influences.
Occasionally, anti-security in the network infrastructure will
turn around and bite its authors in the ass - comprehensive
Chinese penetration of U.S. military contractors and the OMB
personnel records fiasco will probably stand as classic examples
for quite a while.  But occasional victories by one's adversaries
is a cost of doing business in any war, including information
warfare against one's own restive and unruly populace.  Lessons
are learned, tactics are adjusted, and the information warriors
move on to the next battle front.
We shall have a "more secure Internet" going forward.  But as long
as we do have a ruling class, we shall not have a "secure
Internet" except at the scale of darknet operations that, as their
name implies, are as secure against wide public participation as
they are against State and corporate surveillance.
I do hope the IETF and IT industries proves me at least partially
wrong, by implementing the objectives outlined in RFC 6973.  But I
believe nothing of this sort can be implemented until or unless
sufficient technical countermeasures to enable State and corporate
actors to proceed with mass surveillance and censorship as usual
are available.
Another security issue overshadows all of the above:  The role of
disinformation operations that attack the network's end users via
weaponized social psychology.  But that's a whole 'nother topic.

In any healthy and productive engineering shop, physical or

forgiven for seeing a "meritocracy" where none exists.  In a
healthy, productive engineering shop, anyone who contributes to
the practical objectives of the project is valued as a team member

to make large and highly visible contributions may thereby become
"popular" but this does not confer authority on them, and is not
an obstacle to anyone else's contributions.
Of course there are dysfunctional engineering shops, commercial

participants in a toxic work environment promise to play nice, and
promise to punish those who do not, would only compound existing
abuses of power by adding a fresh layer of passive aggressive

Does this phenomenon represent spontaneous demands for justice

between dissident factions and demographics?  I do not think it
matters.  I think the functional consequences of that campaign and
the response it elicits do matter.
Crypto-Anarchy has an inherent agenda of enabling populist
political resistance, organization and uprisings.  To whatever
extent this agenda could find applications in real life, it merits
hostile attention from State sponsored actors.  Depicting the
CPunk and Hacker communities as gangs of racist misogynists, and
prodding them in ways designed to provoke open mockery of any such

When it comes to the "chilling effects" of State surveillance,
everybody who subscribes to CPunks is a member of a certain type of
Polar Bear Club.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
I use GMail accounts as spam filters, i.e. destination addresses for
contact forms on websites, and as logins for G-Everything services
like Google Analytics.
Google Analytics does make it "easier" for Google's best friend, tech
support department and business partner NSA to keep track of who is
visiting the websites in question, but the trade-off in utility for
yrs. truly & clients more than justifies that.  Anybody who wants a
lower profile on the networks already blocks execution of javascript
except from whitelisted domains, and blocks calls from their browsers
to any URL with the string "analytics" in its URL.
I did register a domain name and hire a hosting service /just/ so I
could have real e-mail accounts, more or less under my own control.  I
did this for convenience, not any belief that it presents a barrier to
State surveillance.
On a related note, something truly horrible:  I have an active account
with NSA subsidiary The Facebook.  Initially I set it up to test
"social network integration" features when making websites:  You can't
market to the rubes in the cheap seats unless you can see the Internet
through their piggy little eyes.  Eventually I decided "what the hell"
and started pumping out propaganda there.  This led directly to
physical participation in the local activist & radical scene.
Given that my network traffic has been flagged for full take and
permanent retention by every U.S. intelligence service capable of same
since such capabilities first became available, I am sure that my
presence on The Facebook does more harm to them and their interests
than it does to me and my interests.  State surveillance at least
guarantees one an audience.

In the sense that "legal" means compliant with orders imposed by the

gain immunity from a sovereign State's enforcement powers by

If the Sovereign stops being a Sovereign by abandoning the enforcement
powers that define State sovereignty, that's different - but the order

My own view is that the sole function of the State it to convert money
into power, then back into money.  Partial reinvestment of State
partons' capital gains produces an accelerating feedback cycle,
concentrating more money (=power) into fewer hands over time.  I don't
anticipate this changing as corporations become more sovereign and
States less so.
I think that's a matter of perspective.  Some of "poorest of the poor"
have seen rising incomes, while the "middle class" in many
industrialized jurisdictions has been taking a beating.  But the
billionaires, "statistically insignificant" in terms of head count,
continue to dominate political activity due to the massive extent of
income and assets inequality that appears at the very top of the scale.
A couple of graphs based on U.S. statistics:
  (a real classic)
- - or -
  (less extreme-looking aggregate numbers)
This raises the issue of implementation.  In the case at hand,
counter-anonymity is a question of money:  How much money do you have,
how badly do you want to prevent anonymous transactions?  Remailers,
onion and garlic routing, etc. are at present only somewhat resistant
to an adversary who can observe much of the network, most of the time.
 I envision a briefing where a select group of U.S. billionaires and
telco CEOs learn about AP and are told, "We must spend x trillion
dollars over the next decade to keep this from happening."  Rinse and
repeat in other national and corporate jurisdictions.  Ouch.
I believe that this advantage should be sufficient, given prevailing
conditions as illustrated by the L-Curve graph mentioned above, and
the imperfect nature of anonymity technologies available or envisioned
today.  The absurd spike at the top of the income scale gives a
handful of individuals enormously disproportionate power, and they aim
to keep it.
I think that should be preceded with, "If successful."  Funding a
global, directly democratic freelance mercenary force targeting
"abusers of" power would not produce a post-AP world overnight.
Exhausting the defensive and counter-offensive resources of today's
ruling class would take time.  Assuring that assets pass intact from
deceased owners to their heirs and assignees is already a core
function of the State, so killing individual billionaires might
introduce turbulence but would not remove the problem of "minority
rule by violent means."  I think it would be likely to lead to wide
scale ultra-violent responses.
I have my doubts.  The cost of overcoming the defences of a President
would be astronomically higher than the costs and risks of overcoming
the defences of, for instance, an independent journalist.  This would
mandate a much higher bounty on the former.  Conversely, public demand
for removing an unpopular President would also be proportionally
higher - a mitigating factor.  Conversely x2, that President's backers
might consider certain journalists worth paying over-market prices to
remove, as her efforts might eventually aim the AP process at them
It seems to me that replacing an unjust and inequitable system of
governance enforced by the threat of murder, with a more just and fair
system of governance enforced by murder would not produce results that
most would consider ethical.  Not to say that, if successfully
implemented as envisioned, it would necessarily be worse than what we
have today.
A "Court" is a forum governed by a sovereign authority, where
petitions and arguments are heard and decisions on the application of
sovereign authority are made.  A Court whose sole function is to
authorize murder could dispense revenge, but never justice:  Every
sovereign in every war throughout history has presented its casus
belli as the defense of human life, and the fact that war is tolerated
by enough people to make it possible demonstrates that application of
a "non-aggression principle" in conjunction with decisions to hire and
direct murderers can not be entrusted to either sovereigns or a
peasant rabble.
Ever since the appearance of hierarchical societies with capital
assets to defend, assassination markets of a sort, e.g. military and
police activities, have been the bedrock of political and economic
systems.  The anonymity element has traditionally been partial and
figurative - decisions to commit State sanctioned murder are "nothing
personal" in the sense that they are supported by consensus across
committees and syndicates, automated to the fullest extent possible
(law, policy, due process), and paid for by small payments from large
numbers of peasants who have been persuaded to tolerate murder for
hire "for the greater good."  Those who do the actual killing are
absolved of liability because they are "faceless cogs in the machne"
only following orders.  The AP model radically streamlines and
democratizes, but does not remove, today's process of controlling
people via murder "for the greater good of the greater number."
If the practical barriers to its implementation could be overcome, AP
might be an improvement over present methods.  Revenge is not justice,
but unlike justice it can at least be played as a formal game.  AP
markets would eventually provide great entertainment, in the form of
assassin vs. assassin contests triggered by contentious "hits."
Crowdfunding contract killers to identify and kill other contract
killers could evolve into a full replacement for today's professional
athletic amusements.
The seeds were everywhere.  Lots of twistid visionaries saw
assassination markets coming, though none worked out the details to
make it (nearly) practicable - that was waiting on applicable
- From Subvert Comix  by Spain Rodriguez, 1976:
But again, the devil is in the details:  Thus far it looks to me like
the twin problems of anonymity that is not reliably anonymous, and the
vast scale of financial resources presently controlled by the segments
of the population who are AP's likeliest targets, are outstanding
problems complicating AP's implementation.
Back in 1984 I was interviewed by a non-human intelligence, who
briefly explained why it was self evidently necessary to remove 90% of
the Earth's human population and asked for authorization to proceed.
I could not fault his case, but I did impose a condition on my
acceptance of his offer:  Proceed only if everyone faces an equal
chance of removal - no favoritism or exemptions of any kind allowed.
Apparently a compliant solution is taking quite a long time to
implement.  But as and when it is, many of the problems AP would
combat would be greatly reduced, as would the practical barriers to
AP's implementation.
Although a "better future" was not promised or even implied, I am
cautiously optimistic...

Of course, this kind of thing is unheard of.  Unless the name Mendax
means anything to you.
It is possible that Our Mr. Applebaum is a raging asshole who routinely
mistreats women in serious ways.  But if so, the lack of any criminal
charges or civil action is surprising.
It is possible that he is a victim of spontaneous combustion comparable
to the Mean Girls on the cheerleading squad getting some amusing
revenge, motivated by nothing more serious than some naive sap's
socially awkward behavior.  That model fits the available evidence
better than the criminal model.
It is highly probable that IF a political warfare activity was asked to
arrange this party for Our Mr. Applebaum, they could quote a very
reasonable price and deliver the goods on time.  The beauty part:  By
itself this observation proves nothing, as it is difficult or impossible
to prove absent a credible inside source.  That's the beauty part of the

security is taken to include protecting intelligence service access to
surveillance and sabotage targets via widely distributed security
defects in IT products and services, either "cybersecurity" or
national security must be sacrificed.
A security model can not be "just a little bit pregnant."  Every
variance or exception that permits violations of any system's
specified security protocol creates new vulnerabilities that
compromise the security of that system, usually in subtle as well as
obvious ways. Security threats are both external and internal to the
enterprise, and include hackers who want to break in for fun and/or
profit, but also:  Enterprise IT consumers who who make non-negotiable
demands for features and functions that create security
vulnerabilities; senior executives whose golfing buddies know more
about network security than the enterprise's entire IT staff; IT
vendors who are free to hide deficiencies and misrepresent their wares
under immunity from prosecution or civil liability; academics and
consultants whose personal fortunes rise and fall with the value of
vendor-specific credentials; and certified technical workforces whose
educational and occupational background is restricted to a vendor
specific context, and includes mandatory training as outside sales
reps for those same vendors.  Add to this the massive political
influence of dominant U.S. IT vendors' senior executives and major
shareholders, and our picture of an industry hard wired for security
failure is complete.  The expected end result of the complex of
counter-security factors outlined above would be smoking rubble, and
that is and apt description of prevailing network security conditions.
Pervasive "cybersecurity" failures have prompted the Executive branch
to prepare for intervention across both government and private sector
domains; in itself this is evidence that a deep systemic disorder
harmful to the National Interest has been recognized and acknowledged.
 Developing a functional model that explains why an emergency exists
is the first step toward reliably and durably ending it.  The
inclusive nature of the Commission's mandate requires it to address
"cybersecurity" in a holistic manner.  The systemic disorders listed
above are inherent in the present economic and political relationships
of parties whose inputs control IT security across all domains.
Effective solutions will be called "radical" and rightly so, as one
must change the underlying economic and political relationships that
drive the ongoing failure of "cybersecurity" to achieve meaningful
results.  Bolting layers of external reinforcement onto a broken
machine does not fix the machine, only prolongs its ability to produce
broken outputs.  Like an urban renewal project, implementing an
effective national "cybersecurity" strategy begins with a wrecking
ball.  If this is not an acceptable option, "enhanced cybersecurity"
is not a possible outcome.
In the present context, trust has two distinct and nearly opposite
definitions:  In a political context, trust means confidence
cultivated to further a collaborative and/or manipulative agenda.  In
a network security context, trust is a controlled asset whose role is
minimized on every front and excluded where and as possible:  A
trusted actor or system is one that can break your security model.
A competent IT security strategy compartmentalizes, simplifies and
hardens the handling of protected assets.  Tools must be selected and
protocols designed on a case by case basis to enable a given
enterprise or department's necessary functions while minimizing
exposure of its assets to hostile actors.  Trust is rationed, and
dispensed only where and as the benefits of trust outweigh the risks.
As a simple example illustrating the role of trust in "cybersecurity,"
all major web browsers automatically download and execute software as
directed by any website their users visit, without the user's
knowledge or express consent.  Large families of critical security
vulnerabilities grow from this promiscuous trust model.  Many botnets
propagate themselves via this vector, which has also enabled targeted
attacks compromising "secured" assets affecting major corporations and
government agencies.  Browser makers build automatic execution of 3rd
party software into their browsers because both end users and major
commercial website operators demand it.  Vendor efforts to mitigate
this critical security threat by 'sanitizing and sandboxing' incoming
executable code can reduce but not reliably prevent high impact
security incidents arising from a fundamentally insecure trust model.
Informed end users can install tools like NoScript which prevent the
browser from downloading and executing software without the user's
express consent.  Individual websites can be whitelisted by the user,
where and as the benefits of automatically executing arbitrary
software from a given site are believed to outweigh the risks of doing
so.  In practice this trivially simple trust based security measure
has proven itself orders of magnitude more effective than a
promiscuous trust model "mitigated" by complex, failure prone defenses
against hostile code.
Bridging the trust gap between the IT community and the US government
is already a done deal, because there has never been one.  The U.S.
government funded and directed the creation of the IT industry.  As
indicated above, the existing bridges enabling public/private
partnership in IT enterprises create promiscuous trust relationships
in the face of conflicts of interest, perverse incentives and
institutional inertia all working against the objectives of
"cybersecurity."  Rather than reinforcing them, these bridges must be
locked down or removed as the first step toward enhancing
The U.S. government has not alienated the IT community:  It has
shielded this community from liability for fraudulent performance
claims, fed it billions of dollars of annual revenue, and given
Fortune 500 IT corporations nearly full control of government policy
affecting those same corporations.  The intimate partnership of IT
vendors and government decision makers has, however, alienated a large
segment of the public at large.  With regard to privacy concerns, IT
vendors are correctly perceived as the government's partners in
domestic mass surveillance.  The interests of the IT community are
directly served by the government's nearly absolute tolerance for
commercial mass surveillance, inherently insecure products and
protocols, forced obsolescence strategies and abusive marketing
practices - all of which are routinely implemented by major IT vendors
to reduce costs and/or enhance revenues.
The current condition of gross insecurity across private and State
owned IT assets is a product of the dominant role of vendors who are
richly rewarded for exploiting the technological ignorance of private
and public sector decision makers.  The cumulative cost of unstable,
insecure IT infrastructure supplied and serviced by parasitic vendors
greatly exceeds the short term costs of replacement with stable,
security oriented infrastructure; but perverse incentives and
conflicts of interest assure that no such course can be taken absent
dynamic and determined public sector leadership.
Revoke software vendors' blanket immunity from prosecution for
consumer fraud and from liability for damage caused by failure to
control product defects.  Where there is no accountability, there is
no motivation to spend money on security and no rational basis for
consumer trust.  The infallible invisible hand of the Free Market can
not produce security, quality or innovation where the State grants
special immunity from prosecution and civil liability to privileged
Mandate security evaluations based on performance and design metrics
for all software (and firmware) purchased for use by government
agencies and departments.  These evaluations must include examination
of the specific product offerings under consideration, and the
bidder's historical security track record across all products.  Total
cost of ownership calculations for IT assets must include estimated
costs of potential security failures, and projected costs of recovery
from same, proportionally adjusted to reflect the relative security
performance of each competing bidder's products.  This could be
facilitated by the establishment of a transparent, accountable Federal
activity that collects relevant data and produces reports in a
standardized format consistent with government procurement process.
Mandate reporting of security incidents by every government activity,
and every commercial enterprise with a State or Federal tax ID, where
financial losses and costs of remediation and recovery from the
incident exceed $5,000.00.  Require reporting of the category of
failure, specific software tools that presented the vulnerabilities
exploited, direct losses incurred, and the costs of remedial and
recovery measures taken.  Specify that aggregate data from these
reports be made available to the public on at least a quarterly basis.
Direct the Federal Communication Commission to conduct and annually
review studies on the privacy impacts, positive and negative, of
deployed and proposed network communication protocols and Standards,
publicly report their findings, and solicit public comments in a
transparent process.  Mandate that all reports reference IETF RFC
6973, Privacy Considerations, as guidance in identifying, naming and
evaluating adverse and beneficial privacy impacts of deployed and
proposed network communication protocols and architectures.
See above.  A durable commitment of all necessary resources to assure
that the measures suggested in response to query 2 are effectively
implemented would create and sustain rational, constrained trust
relationships affecting all those aspects of "cybersecurity" which are
properly the government's business.
The requirement that recommendations be "realistic" is regrettable.
"Practicable" would have been better language.  A realistic proposal
might be considered as one that will not provoke a do-or-die defense
of the status quo from dominant IT vendors, U.S. intelligence
activities, and others whose bread and butter is "cyber insecurity."
A practicable proposal would be one that is within the scope of public
policy authorities and industry capabilities:  Vendors who assert that
requirements are "impossible" or simply refuse to comply will be
replaced by vendors who are ready to step forward and meet any
challenges presented.  Solutions to many of today's most serious and
widespread network security failures are already avaialbe as off the
shelf products from vendors with excellent security track records.
The proposals presented under query 3 above may not be considered
reasonable by dominant industry stakeholders, but they are
practicable, and these or materially similar policy initiatives are
necessary if the President is serious about getting the results he has
asked for.

Microsoft would lose its most important State protections, all its
government contracts, and a large part of its market share in the

My first draft was an explicit Microsoft death sentence, I worked

would assure the same result.

Windows 98; in their use cases it "just works" and they see no need to
fix it.  There are still millions of XP installations grinding away

breaks or something comes along that offers a real improvement in the

forced obsolescence, managed security failure, and product

Can't say that I see much value in toys created for the purpose of
reinforcing the brand loyalty of Sheeple 2.0 with regard to whatever
Identity Politics trap they have fallen into.  Of course if you /want/
to deploy a stupidity amplifier, anything that constantly reminds a
True Believer that he or she is better than other people will do the
trick.  Does your bright idea help mutually alienate people who might
otherwise band together to promote their common interests at the
expense of their rulers?  Apply for a grant!
Identity politics works by conditioning people to pin their self
esteem on the inherent superiority of their racial, language,
national, economic, social and/or political in-group.  Strict
compliance with the pseudo-gang's rigid stereotypical beliefs and
behaviors makes the faithful Somebodies, and prevents them from
associating with hated Others.
Like all effective propaganda platforms, identity politics formalizes
and exploits a pre-existing human weakness, in this case the so-called
herd instinct.  Identity politics is maintained and advanced through
strategy that consistently scapegoats and demonizes targeted Others
and, to a lesser extent, anyone else who fails to hear and obey the
correct Party Line.  Logic, reason and practicality are off the table,
although simulating these to provide "proofs" of what Believers
already believe is an important part of the complete and balanced
propaganda breakfast.  It's easy, because all issues are reduced to
binary us versus them issues.  The more valid an evidence based
criticism of any article of faith, the more desperately the true
believer clutches for straws:  It doesn't take much to "rescue" them
from wrong thinking.
Otherwise sane and rational people become easily led animals when they
fall under the spell of identity politics; a high IQ only means
superior internal resources for rationalizing ignorant beliefs.
That's where Knee Jerk Reactionary Republicans, Yellow Dog Democrats
and other packaged personlike Product comes from, and how segmented
markets are herded into battles that assure a populace so divided
against itself that its rulers have a free hand to do whatever they
want unopposed, except by easily marginalized outliers and minorities.
Funny thing:  Lots of readers will agree with the above assessment,
because it applies to ignorant easily led Other People, proving that
their own identity group is better.

"Obsessive avoidance of Internet surveillance does not take you off
the radar, it only takes you out of the game." - Me
When it comes to the "chilling effects" of State surveillance,
everybody who subscribes to CPunks is a member of a certain type of
Polar Bear Club.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
I use GMail accounts as spam filters, i.e. destination addresses for
contact forms on websites, and as logins for G-Everything services
like Google Analytics.
Google Analytics does make it "easier" for Google's best friend, tech
support department and business partner NSA to keep track of who is
visiting the websites in question, but the trade-off in utility for
yrs. truly & clients more than justifies that.  Anybody who wants a
lower profile on the networks already blocks execution of javascript
except from whitelisted domains, and blocks calls from their browsers
to any URL with the string "analytics" in its URL.
I did register a domain name and hire a hosting service /just/ so I
could have real e-mail accounts, more or less under my own control.  I
did this for convenience, not any belief that it presents a barrier to
State surveillance.
On a related note, something truly horrible:  I have an active account
with NSA subsidiary The Facebook.  Initially I set it up to test
"social network integration" features when making websites:  You can't
market to the rubes in the cheap seats unless you can see the Internet
through their piggy little eyes.  Eventually I decided "what the hell"
and started pumping out propaganda there.  This led directly to
physical participation in the local activist & radical scene.
Given that my network traffic has been flagged for full take and
permanent retention by every U.S. intelligence service capable of same
since such capabilities first became available, I am sure that my
presence on The Facebook does more harm to them and their interests
than it does to me and my interests.  State surveillance at least
guarantees one an audience.

But obsessive avoidance of surveillance takes one out of the game of

one's ability to monitor opposition propaganda and team building
efforts.  That's a big win for the opposition:  The so-called chilling

It is also beneficial to use evasive tools and tactics on a regular

My own view is that the sole function of the State it to convert money
into power, then back into money.  Partial reinvestment of State
partons' capital gains produces an accelerating feedback cycle,
concentrating more money (=power) into fewer hands over time.  I don't
anticipate this changing as corporations become more sovereign and
States less so.
I think that's a matter of perspective.  Some of "poorest of the poor"
have seen rising incomes, while the "middle class" in many
industrialized jurisdictions has been taking a beating.  But the
billionaires, "statistically insignificant" in terms of head count,
continue to dominate political activity due to the massive extent of
income and assets inequality that appears at the very top of the scale.
A couple of graphs based on U.S. statistics:
  (a real classic)
- - or -
  (less extreme-looking aggregate numbers)
This raises the issue of implementation.  In the case at hand,
counter-anonymity is a question of money:  How much money do you have,
how badly do you want to prevent anonymous transactions?  Remailers,
onion and garlic routing, etc. are at present only somewhat resistant
to an adversary who can observe much of the network, most of the time.
 I envision a briefing where a select group of U.S. billionaires and
telco CEOs learn about AP and are told, "We must spend x trillion
dollars over the next decade to keep this from happening."  Rinse and
repeat in other national and corporate jurisdictions.  Ouch.
I believe that this advantage should be sufficient, given prevailing
conditions as illustrated by the L-Curve graph mentioned above, and
the imperfect nature of anonymity technologies available or envisioned
today.  The absurd spike at the top of the income scale gives a
handful of individuals enormously disproportionate power, and they aim
to keep it.
I think that should be preceded with, "If successful."  Funding a
global, directly democratic freelance mercenary force targeting
"abusers of" power would not produce a post-AP world overnight.
Exhausting the defensive and counter-offensive resources of today's
ruling class would take time.  Assuring that assets pass intact from
deceased owners to their heirs and assignees is already a core
function of the State, so killing individual billionaires might
introduce turbulence but would not remove the problem of "minority
rule by violent means."  I think it would be likely to lead to wide
scale ultra-violent responses.
I have my doubts.  The cost of overcoming the defences of a President
would be astronomically higher than the costs and risks of overcoming
the defences of, for instance, an independent journalist.  This would
mandate a much higher bounty on the former.  Conversely, public demand
for removing an unpopular President would also be proportionally
higher - a mitigating factor.  Conversely x2, that President's backers
might consider certain journalists worth paying over-market prices to
remove, as her efforts might eventually aim the AP process at them
It seems to me that replacing an unjust and inequitable system of
governance enforced by the threat of murder, with a more just and fair
system of governance enforced by murder would not produce results that
most would consider ethical.  Not to say that, if successfully
implemented as envisioned, it would necessarily be worse than what we
have today.
A "Court" is a forum governed by a sovereign authority, where
petitions and arguments are heard and decisions on the application of
sovereign authority are made.  A Court whose sole function is to
authorize murder could dispense revenge, but never justice:  Every
sovereign in every war throughout history has presented its casus
belli as the defense of human life, and the fact that war is tolerated
by enough people to make it possible demonstrates that application of
a "non-aggression principle" in conjunction with decisions to hire and
direct murderers can not be entrusted to either sovereigns or a
peasant rabble.
Ever since the appearance of hierarchical societies with capital
assets to defend, assassination markets of a sort, e.g. military and
police activities, have been the bedrock of political and economic
systems.  The anonymity element has traditionally been partial and
figurative - decisions to commit State sanctioned murder are "nothing
personal" in the sense that they are supported by consensus across
committees and syndicates, automated to the fullest extent possible
(law, policy, due process), and paid for by small payments from large
numbers of peasants who have been persuaded to tolerate murder for
hire "for the greater good."  Those who do the actual killing are
absolved of liability because they are "faceless cogs in the machne"
only following orders.  The AP model radically streamlines and
democratizes, but does not remove, today's process of controlling
people via murder "for the greater good of the greater number."
If the practical barriers to its implementation could be overcome, AP
might be an improvement over present methods.  Revenge is not justice,
but unlike justice it can at least be played as a formal game.  AP
markets would eventually provide great entertainment, in the form of
assassin vs. assassin contests triggered by contentious "hits."
Crowdfunding contract killers to identify and kill other contract
killers could evolve into a full replacement for today's professional
athletic amusements.
The seeds were everywhere.  Lots of twistid visionaries saw
assassination markets coming, though none worked out the details to
make it (nearly) practicable - that was waiting on applicable
- From Subvert Comix  by Spain Rodriguez, 1976:
But again, the devil is in the details:  Thus far it looks to me like
the twin problems of anonymity that is not reliably anonymous, and the
vast scale of financial resources presently controlled by the segments
of the population who are AP's likeliest targets, are outstanding
problems complicating AP's implementation.
Back in 1984 I was interviewed by a non-human intelligence, who
briefly explained why it was self evidently necessary to remove 90% of
the Earth's human population and asked for authorization to proceed.
I could not fault his case, but I did impose a condition on my
acceptance of his offer:  Proceed only if everyone faces an equal
chance of removal - no favoritism or exemptions of any kind allowed.
Apparently a compliant solution is taking quite a long time to
implement.  But as and when it is, many of the problems AP would
combat would be greatly reduced, as would the practical barriers to
AP's implementation.
Although a "better future" was not promised or even implied, I am
cautiously optimistic...

Everything is under control; your control or someone else's.
A trusted system is one that can break your security model.
A hardened perimeter is easily broken; a hardened system, not so much.
The laws of nations are easily broken; the laws of physics, not so much.
In God we trust, all others provide full source code for peer review.
Given enough observers, all bugs are shallow.
To make a system stronger, attack it.
Physical access can compromise any network security model.
A failed data backup may cost more than a successful break-in.
An unexamined assumption is a ticking time bomb.
User refusal is the principal barrier to secure networking.

I have myself been declared a motherfucker by Juan's executive fiat,
though not if I recall correctly a Statist Pig.  Perhaps this post will
rectify that deficiency.  Only time will tell.
Not everyone seems to be in agreement about how horrible ioerror is.
His defenders include at least one individual who isn't afraid of
disclosing information that she knows sounds "paranoid," in the process
of disclosing her take on Jake.
The absence of any legal proceedings, criminal or civil, seems rather a
big data point.  Lots of people are willing to throw stones, nobody is
willing to face a potential perjury charge or countersuit.  Maybe nobody
was actually harmed, beyond hurt feelings.
Any male geek person with Our Mr. Applebaum's "celebrity" status who is
also (in my heteronormative radical queer opinion) good looking, is very
likely to avail himself of the sexual perquisites of social prestige.
If that is the case with Our Mr. Applebaum, it would inevitably result
in at least /some/ hurt feelings, even if he was a perfect fucking
knight in shining armor - which he probably ain't, because who is?
Pardon my macroaggression, but there is a very current Identity Politics
fad for cutting all Male Pigs down to size, and its fan base demographic
intersects with the fan base of everything that even looks "radical and
culturally cutting edge" to a fuzzy studies major, including the TOR
Project.  In this social matrix, acts of simple careless idiocy, devoid
of malice and producing no real harm, could lead to all of the charges
we have seen.
If you are of a paranoid bent, ask whether a political warfare operation
could produce the exact results seen in Our Mr. Applebaum's recent
history.  Seeking out unsatisfied customers of Brand Jake who are
associated with evangelists for Feminazi fashion would be a snap:
Thanks to ubiquitous surveillance with automated social network mapping
and psychographic classification, finding people matching the desired
profile and history would only require a work order.  Develop one agent
- witting or not - and the rest handles itself.  (If, and please pardon
the expression, Our Mr. Applebaum has exposed himself in any way.)
Of course, this kind of thing is unheard of.  Unless the name Mendax
means anything to you.
It is possible that Our Mr. Applebaum is a raging asshole who routinely
mistreats women in serious ways.  But if so, the lack of any criminal
charges or civil action is surprising.
It is possible that he is a victim of spontaneous combustion comparable
to the Mean Girls on the cheerleading squad getting some amusing
revenge, motivated by nothing more serious than some naive sap's
socially awkward behavior.  That model fits the available evidence
better than the criminal model.
It is highly probable that IF a political warfare activity was asked to
arrange this party for Our Mr. Applebaum, they could quote a very
reasonable price and deliver the goods on time.  The beauty part:  By
itself this observation proves nothing, as it is difficult or impossible
to prove absent a credible inside source.  That's the beauty part of the
institution of State Secrecy.

via a reputation attack.  I would not rule that out, but I would

State Department (funding TOR as a vector for transmitting State
propaganda to foreign audiences), CIA (a love/hate relationship with
TOR; helps some missions, hinders others), the FBI (we hates all nasty

If the TOR Project ever manages to well and truly piss the State

complicate lots of political warfare projects in progress against

Herb Lin -----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

The mission defined above is much more ambitious than it may initially
appear, because direct conflicts of interest are hard wired into it.
The "cybersecurity" buzzword embraces a spectrum of practical security
context from protecting consumer financial credentials through
shielding "secret" government databases from unauthorized access, to
preventing malicious alteration of the firmware that runs our civil
and industrial infrastructure.  Privacy is not encompassed by the term
"cybersecurity" as it is intended and understood by those who use
presently use it in a national policy context - but this can and
should change.
Network security addresses practical concerns of privacy, utility,
reliability and cost effectiveness as well as countermeasures to
stereotypical hacker threats.  The express inclusion of privacy
protection in its brief directs the Commission to deliver
recommendations directly counter to the interests of private
enterprises and government departments which presently collect,
analyze, and transfer or act on "private" information about
individuals and groups.  If economic security is taken to include
protecting the revenue streams of dominant U.S. IT vendors and their
associated armies of specialized workers in the field, either
"cybersecurity" or economic security must be sacrificed.  If national
security is taken to include protecting intelligence service access to
surveillance and sabotage targets via widely distributed security
defects in IT products and services, either "cybersecurity" or
national security must be sacrificed.
A security model can not be "just a little bit pregnant."  Every
variance or exception that permits violations of any system's
specified security protocol creates new vulnerabilities that
compromise the security of that system, usually in subtle as well as
obvious ways. Security threats are both external and internal to the
enterprise, and include hackers who want to break in for fun and/or
profit, but also:  Enterprise IT consumers who who make non-negotiable
demands for features and functions that create security
vulnerabilities; senior executives whose golfing buddies know more
about network security than the enterprise's entire IT staff; IT
vendors who are free to hide deficiencies and misrepresent their wares
under immunity from prosecution or civil liability; academics and
consultants whose personal fortunes rise and fall with the value of
vendor-specific credentials; and certified technical workforces whose
educational and occupational background is restricted to a vendor
specific context, and includes mandatory training as outside sales
reps for those same vendors.  Add to this the massive political
influence of dominant U.S. IT vendors' senior executives and major
shareholders, and our picture of an industry hard wired for security
failure is complete.  The expected end result of the complex of
counter-security factors outlined above would be smoking rubble, and
that is and apt description of prevailing network security conditions.
Pervasive "cybersecurity" failures have prompted the Executive branch
to prepare for intervention across both government and private sector
domains; in itself this is evidence that a deep systemic disorder
harmful to the National Interest has been recognized and acknowledged.
 Developing a functional model that explains why an emergency exists
is the first step toward reliably and durably ending it.  The
inclusive nature of the Commission's mandate requires it to address
"cybersecurity" in a holistic manner.  The systemic disorders listed
above are inherent in the present economic and political relationships
of parties whose inputs control IT security across all domains.
Effective solutions will be called "radical" and rightly so, as one
must change the underlying economic and political relationships that
drive the ongoing failure of "cybersecurity" to achieve meaningful
results.  Bolting layers of external reinforcement onto a broken
machine does not fix the machine, only prolongs its ability to produce
broken outputs.  Like an urban renewal project, implementing an
effective national "cybersecurity" strategy begins with a wrecking
ball.  If this is not an acceptable option, "enhanced cybersecurity"
is not a possible outcome.
In the present context, trust has two distinct and nearly opposite
definitions:  In a political context, trust means confidence
cultivated to further a collaborative and/or manipulative agenda.  In
a network security context, trust is a controlled asset whose role is
minimized on every front and excluded where and as possible:  A
trusted actor or system is one that can break your security model.
A competent IT security strategy compartmentalizes, simplifies and
hardens the handling of protected assets.  Tools must be selected and
protocols designed on a case by case basis to enable a given
enterprise or department's necessary functions while minimizing
exposure of its assets to hostile actors.  Trust is rationed, and
dispensed only where and as the benefits of trust outweigh the risks.
As a simple example illustrating the role of trust in "cybersecurity,"
all major web browsers automatically download and execute software as
directed by any website their users visit, without the user's
knowledge or express consent.  Large families of critical security
vulnerabilities grow from this promiscuous trust model.  Many botnets
propagate themselves via this vector, which has also enabled targeted
attacks compromising "secured" assets affecting major corporations and
government agencies.  Browser makers build automatic execution of 3rd
party software into their browsers because both end users and major
commercial website operators demand it.  Vendor efforts to mitigate
this critical security threat by 'sanitizing and sandboxing' incoming
executable code can reduce but not reliably prevent high impact
security incidents arising from a fundamentally insecure trust model.
Informed end users can install tools like NoScript which prevent the
browser from downloading and executing software without the user's
express consent.  Individual websites can be whitelisted by the user,
where and as the benefits of automatically executing arbitrary
software from a given site are believed to outweigh the risks of doing
so.  In practice this trivially simple trust based security measure
has proven itself orders of magnitude more effective than a
promiscuous trust model "mitigated" by complex, failure prone defenses
against hostile code.
Bridging the trust gap between the IT community and the US government
is already a done deal, because there has never been one.  The U.S.
government funded and directed the creation of the IT industry.  As
indicated above, the existing bridges enabling public/private
partnership in IT enterprises create promiscuous trust relationships
in the face of conflicts of interest, perverse incentives and
institutional inertia all working against the objectives of
"cybersecurity."  Rather than reinforcing them, these bridges must be
locked down or removed as the first step toward enhancing
The U.S. government has not alienated the IT community:  It has
shielded this community from liability for fraudulent performance
claims, fed it billions of dollars of annual revenue, and given
Fortune 500 IT corporations nearly full control of government policy
affecting those same corporations.  The intimate partnership of IT
vendors and government decision makers has, however, alienated a large
segment of the public at large.  With regard to privacy concerns, IT
vendors are correctly perceived as the government's partners in
domestic mass surveillance.  The interests of the IT community are
directly served by the government's nearly absolute tolerance for
commercial mass surveillance, inherently insecure products and
protocols, forced obsolescence strategies and abusive marketing
practices - all of which are routinely implemented by major IT vendors
to reduce costs and/or enhance revenues.
The current condition of gross insecurity across private and State
owned IT assets is a product of the dominant role of vendors who are
richly rewarded for exploiting the technological ignorance of private
and public sector decision makers.  The cumulative cost of unstable,
insecure IT infrastructure supplied and serviced by parasitic vendors
greatly exceeds the short term costs of replacement with stable,
security oriented infrastructure; but perverse incentives and
conflicts of interest assure that no such course can be taken absent
dynamic and determined public sector leadership.
Revoke software vendors' blanket immunity from prosecution for
consumer fraud and from liability for damage caused by failure to
control product defects.  Where there is no accountability, there is
no motivation to spend money on security and no rational basis for
consumer trust.  The infallible invisible hand of the Free Market can
not produce security, quality or innovation where the State grants
special immunity from prosecution and civil liability to privileged
Mandate security evaluations based on performance and design metrics
for all software (and firmware) purchased for use by government
agencies and departments.  These evaluations must include examination
of the specific product offerings under consideration, and the
bidder's historical security track record across all products.  Total
cost of ownership calculations for IT assets must include estimated
costs of potential security failures, and projected costs of recovery
from same, proportionally adjusted to reflect the relative security
performance of each competing bidder's products.  This could be
facilitated by the establishment of a transparent, accountable Federal
activity that collects relevant data and produces reports in a
standardized format consistent with government procurement process.
Mandate reporting of security incidents by every government activity,
and every commercial enterprise with a State or Federal tax ID, where
financial losses and costs of remediation and recovery from the
incident exceed $5,000.00.  Require reporting of the category of
failure, specific software tools that presented the vulnerabilities
exploited, direct losses incurred, and the costs of remedial and
recovery measures taken.  Specify that aggregate data from these
reports be made available to the public on at least a quarterly basis.
Direct the Federal Communication Commission to conduct and annually
review studies on the privacy impacts, positive and negative, of
deployed and proposed network communication protocols and Standards,
publicly report their findings, and solicit public comments in a
transparent process.  Mandate that all reports reference IETF RFC
6973, Privacy Considerations, as guidance in identifying, naming and
evaluating adverse and beneficial privacy impacts of deployed and
proposed network communication protocols and architectures.
See above.  A durable commitment of all necessary resources to assure
that the measures suggested in response to query 2 are effectively
implemented would create and sustain rational, constrained trust
relationships affecting all those aspects of "cybersecurity" which are
properly the government's business.
The requirement that recommendations be "realistic" is regrettable.
"Practicable" would have been better language.  A realistic proposal
might be considered as one that will not provoke a do-or-die defense
of the status quo from dominant IT vendors, U.S. intelligence
activities, and others whose bread and butter is "cyber insecurity."
A practicable proposal would be one that is within the scope of public
policy authorities and industry capabilities:  Vendors who assert that
requirements are "impossible" or simply refuse to comply will be
replaced by vendors who are ready to step forward and meet any
challenges presented.  Solutions to many of today's most serious and
widespread network security failures are already avaialbe as off the
shelf products from vendors with excellent security track records.
The proposals presented under query 3 above may not be considered
reasonable by dominant industry stakeholders, but they are
practicable, and these or materially similar policy initiatives are
necessary if the President is serious about getting the results he has
asked for.

Note that this would only affect the State itself, and those who have

This ain't a call for regulation; it's just a call for public
reporting by a State agency.  ;)

Microsoft would lose its most important State protections, all its
government contracts, and a large part of its market share in the
business and consumer markets.  Those product lines would be largely
replaced by UNIX model operating systems, Free software applications,
My first draft was an explicit Microsoft death sentence, I worked
backward from there to create generic, vendor agnostic conditions that
would assure the same result.

otherwise band together to promote their common interests at the

Identity politics works by conditioning people to pin their self
esteem on the inherent superiority of their racial, language,
national, economic, social and/or political in-group.  Strict
compliance with the pseudo-gang's rigid stereotypical beliefs and
behaviors makes the faithful Somebodies, and prevents them from
associating with hated Others.
Like all effective propaganda platforms, identity politics formalizes
and exploits a pre-existing human weakness, in this case the so-called
herd instinct.  Identity politics is maintained and advanced through
strategy that consistently scapegoats and demonizes targeted Others
and, to a lesser extent, anyone else who fails to hear and obey the
correct Party Line.  Logic, reason and practicality are off the table,
although simulating these to provide "proofs" of what Believers
already believe is an important part of the complete and balanced
propaganda breakfast.  It's easy, because all issues are reduced to
binary us versus them issues.  The more valid an evidence based
criticism of any article of faith, the more desperately the true
believer clutches for straws:  It doesn't take much to "rescue" them
from wrong thinking.
Otherwise sane and rational people become easily led animals when they
fall under the spell of identity politics; a high IQ only means
superior internal resources for rationalizing ignorant beliefs.
That's where Knee Jerk Reactionary Republicans, Yellow Dog Democrats
and other packaged personlike Product comes from, and how segmented
markets are herded into battles that assure a populace so divided
against itself that its rulers have a free hand to do whatever they
want unopposed, except by easily marginalized outliers and minorities.
Funny thing:  Lots of readers will agree with the above assessment,

When it comes to the "chilling effects" of State surveillance,
everybody who subscribes to CPunks is a member of a certain type of
Polar Bear Club.  Fuck 'em if they can't take a joke.
I use GMail accounts as spam filters, i.e. destination addresses for
contact forms on websites, and as logins for G-Everything services
like Google Analytics.
Google Analytics does make it "easier" for Google's best friend, tech
support department and business partner NSA to keep track of who is
visiting the websites in question, but the trade-off in utility for
yrs. truly & clients more than justifies that.  Anybody who wants a
lower profile on the networks already blocks execution of javascript
except from whitelisted domains, and blocks calls from their browsers
to any URL with the string "analytics" in its URL.
I did register a domain name and hire a hosting service /just/ so I
could have real e-mail accounts, more or less under my own control.  I
did this for convenience, not any belief that it presents a barrier to
State surveillance.
On a related note, something truly horrible:  I have an active account
with NSA subsidiary The Facebook.  Initially I set it up to test
"social network integration" features when making websites:  You can't
market to the rubes in the cheap seats unless you can see the Internet
through their piggy little eyes.  Eventually I decided "what the hell"
and started pumping out propaganda there.  This led directly to
physical participation in the local activist & radical scene.
Given that my network traffic has been flagged for full take and
permanent retention by every U.S. intelligence service capable of same
since such capabilities first became available, I am sure that my
presence on The Facebook does more harm to them and their interests
than it does to me and my interests.  State surveillance at least
guarantees one an audience.

In the sense that "legal" means compliant with orders imposed by the
the State, "legal secession" is a logical absurdity:  One does not
gain immunity from a sovereign State's enforcement powers by
submitting to them, nor independence by obeying its dictates.
If the Sovereign stops being a Sovereign by abandoning the enforcement
powers that define State sovereignty, that's different - but the order
to "do your own thing" remains just a noise.

In the face of this, I think AP may have a problem with scale:  How
many small investors does it take to redirect AP profiteers away from
targets chosen by factions among the ruling class, beginning with
anyone suspected of operating the AP infrastructure and/or promoting
it effectively to a wide audience of participants?
If an AP lottery is not "fair and honest" by allowing anyone to be
targeted regardless of occupation or etc., how long until ones that do
allow any human to be bet on appear, with inflated bounties on
perceived enemies of the ruling class?
Mind you, AP is a frightfully clever idea.

My own view is that the sole function of the State it to convert money
into power, then back into money.  Partial reinvestment of State
partons' capital gains produces an accelerating feedback cycle,
concentrating more money (=power) into fewer hands over time.  I don't
anticipate this changing as corporations become more sovereign and
States less so.
I think that's a matter of perspective.  Some of "poorest of the poor"
have seen rising incomes, while the "middle class" in many
industrialized jurisdictions has been taking a beating.  But the
billionaires, "statistically insignificant" in terms of head count,
continue to dominate political activity due to the massive extent of
income and assets inequality that appears at the very top of the scale.
A couple of graphs based on U.S. statistics:
  (a real classic)
- - or -
  (less extreme-looking aggregate numbers)
This raises the issue of implementation.  In the case at hand,
counter-anonymity is a question of money:  How much money do you have,
how badly do you want to prevent anonymous transactions?  Remailers,
onion and garlic routing, etc. are at present only somewhat resistant
to an adversary who can observe much of the network, most of the time.
 I envision a briefing where a select group of U.S. billionaires and
telco CEOs learn about AP and are told, "We must spend x trillion
dollars over the next decade to keep this from happening."  Rinse and
repeat in other national and corporate jurisdictions.  Ouch.
I believe that this advantage should be sufficient, given prevailing
conditions as illustrated by the L-Curve graph mentioned above, and
the imperfect nature of anonymity technologies available or envisioned
today.  The absurd spike at the top of the income scale gives a
handful of individuals enormously disproportionate power, and they aim
to keep it.
I think that should be preceded with, "If successful."  Funding a
global, directly democratic freelance mercenary force targeting
"abusers of" power would not produce a post-AP world overnight.
Exhausting the defensive and counter-offensive resources of today's
ruling class would take time.  Assuring that assets pass intact from
deceased owners to their heirs and assignees is already a core
function of the State, so killing individual billionaires might
introduce turbulence but would not remove the problem of "minority
rule by violent means."  I think it would be likely to lead to wide
scale ultra-violent responses.
I have my doubts.  The cost of overcoming the defences of a President
would be astronomically higher than the costs and risks of overcoming
the defences of, for instance, an independent journalist.  This would
mandate a much higher bounty on the former.  Conversely, public demand
for removing an unpopular President would also be proportionally
higher - a mitigating factor.  Conversely x2, that President's backers
might consider certain journalists worth paying over-market prices to
remove, as her efforts might eventually aim the AP process at them
It seems to me that replacing an unjust and inequitable system of
governance enforced by the threat of murder, with a more just and fair
system of governance enforced by murder would not produce results that
most would consider ethical.  Not to say that, if successfully
implemented as envisioned, it would necessarily be worse than what we
have today.
A "Court" is a forum governed by a sovereign authority, where
petitions and arguments are heard and decisions on the application of
sovereign authority are made.  A Court whose sole function is to
authorize murder could dispense revenge, but never justice:  Every
sovereign in every war throughout history has presented its casus
belli as the defense of human life, and the fact that war is tolerated
by enough people to make it possible demonstrates that application of
a "non-aggression principle" in conjunction with decisions to hire and
direct murderers can not be entrusted to either sovereigns or a
peasant rabble.
Ever since the appearance of hierarchical societies with capital
assets to defend, assassination markets of a sort, e.g. military and
police activities, have been the bedrock of political and economic
systems.  The anonymity element has traditionally been partial and
figurative - decisions to commit State sanctioned murder are "nothing
personal" in the sense that they are supported by consensus across
committees and syndicates, automated to the fullest extent possible
(law, policy, due process), and paid for by small payments from large
numbers of peasants who have been persuaded to tolerate murder for
hire "for the greater good."  Those who do the actual killing are
absolved of liability because they are "faceless cogs in the machne"
only following orders.  The AP model radically streamlines and
democratizes, but does not remove, today's process of controlling
people via murder "for the greater good of the greater number."
If the practical barriers to its implementation could be overcome, AP
might be an improvement over present methods.  Revenge is not justice,
but unlike justice it can at least be played as a formal game.  AP
markets would eventually provide great entertainment, in the form of
assassin vs. assassin contests triggered by contentious "hits."
Crowdfunding contract killers to identify and kill other contract
killers could evolve into a full replacement for today's professional
athletic amusements.
The seeds were everywhere.  Lots of twistid visionaries saw
assassination markets coming, though none worked out the details to
make it (nearly) practicable - that was waiting on applicable
- From Subvert Comix  by Spain Rodriguez, 1976:
But again, the devil is in the details:  Thus far it looks to me like
the twin problems of anonymity that is not reliably anonymous, and the
vast scale of financial resources presently controlled by the segments
of the population who are AP's likeliest targets, are outstanding
problems complicating AP's implementation.
Back in 1984 I was interviewed by a non-human intelligence, who
briefly explained why it was self evidently necessary to remove 90% of
the Earth's human population and asked for authorization to proceed.
I could not fault his case, but I did impose a condition on my
acceptance of his offer:  Proceed only if everyone faces an equal
chance of removal - no favoritism or exemptions of any kind allowed.
Apparently a compliant solution is taking quite a long time to
implement.  But as and when it is, many of the problems AP would
combat would be greatly reduced, as would the practical barriers to
AP's implementation.
Although a "better future" was not promised or even implied, I am
cautiously optimistic...

Not everyone seems to be in agreement about how horrible ioerror is.
His defenders include at least one individual who isn't afraid of
disclosing information that she knows sounds "paranoid," in the process
of disclosing her take on Jake.
The absence of any legal proceedings, criminal or civil, seems rather a
big data point.  Lots of people are willing to throw stones, nobody is
willing to face a potential perjury charge or countersuit.  Maybe nobody
was actually harmed, beyond hurt feelings.
Any male geek person with Our Mr. Applebaum's "celebrity" status who is
also (in my heteronormative radical queer opinion) good looking, is very
likely to avail himself of the sexual perquisites of social prestige.
If that is the case with Our Mr. Applebaum, it would inevitably result
in at least /some/ hurt feelings, even if he was a perfect fucking
knight in shining armor - which he probably ain't, because who is?
Pardon my macroaggression, but there is a very current Identity Politics
fad for cutting all Male Pigs down to size, and its fan base demographic
intersects with the fan base of everything that even looks "radical and
culturally cutting edge" to a fuzzy studies major, including the TOR
Project.  In this social matrix, acts of simple careless idiocy, devoid
of malice and producing no real harm, could lead to all of the charges
we have seen.
If you are of a paranoid bent, ask whether a political warfare operation
could produce the exact results seen in Our Mr. Applebaum's recent
history.  Seeking out unsatisfied customers of Brand Jake who are
associated with evangelists for Feminazi fashion would be a snap:
Thanks to ubiquitous surveillance with automated social network mapping
and psychographic classification, finding people matching the desired
profile and history would only require a work order.  Develop one agent
- witting or not - and the rest handles itself.  (If, and please pardon
the expression, Our Mr. Applebaum has exposed himself in any way.)
Of course, this kind of thing is unheard of.  Unless the name Mendax
means anything to you.
It is possible that Our Mr. Applebaum is a raging asshole who routinely
mistreats women in serious ways.  But if so, the lack of any criminal
charges or civil action is surprising.
It is possible that he is a victim of spontaneous combustion comparable
to the Mean Girls on the cheerleading squad getting some amusing
revenge, motivated by nothing more serious than some naive sap's
socially awkward behavior.  That model fits the available evidence
better than the criminal model.
It is highly probable that IF a political warfare activity was asked to
arrange this party for Our Mr. Applebaum, they could quote a very
reasonable price and deliver the goods on time.  The beauty part:  By
itself this observation proves nothing, as it is difficult or impossible
to prove absent a credible inside source.  That's the beauty part of the
institution of State Secrecy.

If the TOR Project ever manages to well and truly piss the State

The mission defined above is much more ambitious than it may initially
appear, because direct conflicts of interest are hard wired into it.
The "cybersecurity" buzzword embraces a spectrum of practical security
context from protecting consumer financial credentials through
shielding "secret" government databases from unauthorized access, to
preventing malicious alteration of the firmware that runs our civil
and industrial infrastructure.  Privacy is not encompassed by the term
"cybersecurity" as it is intended and understood by those who use
presently use it in a national policy context - but this can and
should change.
Network security addresses practical concerns of privacy, utility,
reliability and cost effectiveness as well as countermeasures to
stereotypical hacker threats.  The express inclusion of privacy
protection in its brief directs the Commission to deliver
recommendations directly counter to the interests of private
enterprises and government departments which presently collect,
analyze, and transfer or act on "private" information about
individuals and groups.  If economic security is taken to include
protecting the revenue streams of dominant U.S. IT vendors and their
associated armies of specialized workers in the field, either
"cybersecurity" or economic security must be sacrificed.  If national
security is taken to include protecting intelligence service access to
surveillance and sabotage targets via widely distributed security
defects in IT products and services, either "cybersecurity" or
national security must be sacrificed.
A security model can not be "just a little bit pregnant."  Every
variance or exception that permits violations of any system's
specified security protocol creates new vulnerabilities that
compromise the security of that system, usually in subtle as well as
obvious ways. Security threats are both external and internal to the
enterprise, and include hackers who want to break in for fun and/or
profit, but also:  Enterprise IT consumers who who make non-negotiable
demands for features and functions that create security
vulnerabilities; senior executives whose golfing buddies know more
about network security than the enterprise's entire IT staff; IT
vendors who are free to hide deficiencies and misrepresent their wares
under immunity from prosecution or civil liability; academics and
consultants whose personal fortunes rise and fall with the value of
vendor-specific credentials; and certified technical workforces whose
educational and occupational background is restricted to a vendor
specific context, and includes mandatory training as outside sales
reps for those same vendors.  Add to this the massive political
influence of dominant U.S. IT vendors' senior executives and major
shareholders, and our picture of an industry hard wired for security
failure is complete.  The expected end result of the complex of
counter-security factors outlined above would be smoking rubble, and
that is and apt description of prevailing network security conditions.
Pervasive "cybersecurity" failures have prompted the Executive branch
to prepare for intervention across both government and private sector
domains; in itself this is evidence that a deep systemic disorder
harmful to the National Interest has been recognized and acknowledged.
 Developing a functional model that explains why an emergency exists
is the first step toward reliably and durably ending it.  The
inclusive nature of the Commission's mandate requires it to address
"cybersecurity" in a holistic manner.  The systemic disorders listed
above are inherent in the present economic and political relationships
of parties whose inputs control IT security across all domains.
Effective solutions will be called "radical" and rightly so, as one
must change the underlying economic and political relationships that
drive the ongoing failure of "cybersecurity" to achieve meaningful
results.  Bolting layers of external reinforcement onto a broken
machine does not fix the machine, only prolongs its ability to produce
broken outputs.  Like an urban renewal project, implementing an
effective national "cybersecurity" strategy begins with a wrecking
ball.  If this is not an acceptable option, "enhanced cybersecurity"
is not a possible outcome.
In the present context, trust has two distinct and nearly opposite
definitions:  In a political context, trust means confidence
cultivated to further a collaborative and/or manipulative agenda.  In
a network security context, trust is a controlled asset whose role is
minimized on every front and excluded where and as possible:  A
trusted actor or system is one that can break your security model.
A competent IT security strategy compartmentalizes, simplifies and
hardens the handling of protected assets.  Tools must be selected and
protocols designed on a case by case basis to enable a given
enterprise or department's necessary functions while minimizing
exposure of its assets to hostile actors.  Trust is rationed, and
dispensed only where and as the benefits of trust outweigh the risks.
As a simple example illustrating the role of trust in "cybersecurity,"
all major web browsers automatically download and execute software as
directed by any website their users visit, without the user's
knowledge or express consent.  Large families of critical security
vulnerabilities grow from this promiscuous trust model.  Many botnets
propagate themselves via this vector, which has also enabled targeted
attacks compromising "secured" assets affecting major corporations and
government agencies.  Browser makers build automatic execution of 3rd
party software into their browsers because both end users and major
commercial website operators demand it.  Vendor efforts to mitigate
this critical security threat by 'sanitizing and sandboxing' incoming
executable code can reduce but not reliably prevent high impact
security incidents arising from a fundamentally insecure trust model.
Informed end users can install tools like NoScript which prevent the
browser from downloading and executing software without the user's
express consent.  Individual websites can be whitelisted by the user,
where and as the benefits of automatically executing arbitrary
software from a given site are believed to outweigh the risks of doing
so.  In practice this trivially simple trust based security measure
has proven itself orders of magnitude more effective than a
promiscuous trust model "mitigated" by complex, failure prone defenses
against hostile code.
Bridging the trust gap between the IT community and the US government
is already a done deal, because there has never been one.  The U.S.
government funded and directed the creation of the IT industry.  As
indicated above, the existing bridges enabling public/private
partnership in IT enterprises create promiscuous trust relationships
in the face of conflicts of interest, perverse incentives and
institutional inertia all working against the objectives of
"cybersecurity."  Rather than reinforcing them, these bridges must be
locked down or removed as the first step toward enhancing
The U.S. government has not alienated the IT community:  It has
shielded this community from liability for fraudulent performance
claims, fed it billions of dollars of annual revenue, and given
Fortune 500 IT corporations nearly full control of government policy
affecting those same corporations.  The intimate partnership of IT
vendors and government decision makers has, however, alienated a large
segment of the public at large.  With regard to privacy concerns, IT
vendors are correctly perceived as the government's partners in
domestic mass surveillance.  The interests of the IT community are
directly served by the government's nearly absolute tolerance for
commercial mass surveillance, inherently insecure products and
protocols, forced obsolescence strategies and abusive marketing
practices - all of which are routinely implemented by major IT vendors
to reduce costs and/or enhance revenues.
The current condition of gross insecurity across private and State
owned IT assets is a product of the dominant role of vendors who are
richly rewarded for exploiting the technological ignorance of private
and public sector decision makers.  The cumulative cost of unstable,
insecure IT infrastructure supplied and serviced by parasitic vendors
greatly exceeds the short term costs of replacement with stable,
security oriented infrastructure; but perverse incentives and
conflicts of interest assure that no such course can be taken absent
dynamic and determined public sector leadership.
Revoke software vendors' blanket immunity from prosecution for
consumer fraud and from liability for damage caused by failure to
control product defects.  Where there is no accountability, there is
no motivation to spend money on security and no rational basis for
consumer trust.  The infallible invisible hand of the Free Market can
not produce security, quality or innovation where the State grants
special immunity from prosecution and civil liability to privileged
Mandate security evaluations based on performance and design metrics
for all software (and firmware) purchased for use by government
agencies and departments.  These evaluations must include examination
of the specific product offerings under consideration, and the
bidder's historical security track record across all products.  Total
cost of ownership calculations for IT assets must include estimated
costs of potential security failures, and projected costs of recovery
from same, proportionally adjusted to reflect the relative security
performance of each competing bidder's products.  This could be
facilitated by the establishment of a transparent, accountable Federal
activity that collects relevant data and produces reports in a
standardized format consistent with government procurement process.
Mandate reporting of security incidents by every government activity,
and every commercial enterprise with a State or Federal tax ID, where
financial losses and costs of remediation and recovery from the
incident exceed $5,000.00.  Require reporting of the category of
failure, specific software tools that presented the vulnerabilities
exploited, direct losses incurred, and the costs of remedial and
recovery measures taken.  Specify that aggregate data from these
reports be made available to the public on at least a quarterly basis.
Direct the Federal Communication Commission to conduct and annually
review studies on the privacy impacts, positive and negative, of
deployed and proposed network communication protocols and Standards,
publicly report their findings, and solicit public comments in a
transparent process.  Mandate that all reports reference IETF RFC
6973, Privacy Considerations, as guidance in identifying, naming and
evaluating adverse and beneficial privacy impacts of deployed and
proposed network communication protocols and architectures.
See above.  A durable commitment of all necessary resources to assure
that the measures suggested in response to query 2 are effectively
implemented would create and sustain rational, constrained trust
relationships affecting all those aspects of "cybersecurity" which are
properly the government's business.
The requirement that recommendations be "realistic" is regrettable.
"Practicable" would have been better language.  A realistic proposal
might be considered as one that will not provoke a do-or-die defense
of the status quo from dominant IT vendors, U.S. intelligence
activities, and others whose bread and butter is "cyber insecurity."
A practicable proposal would be one that is within the scope of public
policy authorities and industry capabilities:  Vendors who assert that
requirements are "impossible" or simply refuse to comply will be
replaced by vendors who are ready to step forward and meet any
challenges presented.  Solutions to many of today's most serious and
widespread network security failures are already avaialbe as off the
shelf products from vendors with excellent security track records.
The proposals presented under query 3 above may not be considered
reasonable by dominant industry stakeholders, but they are
practicable, and these or materially similar policy initiatives are
necessary if the President is serious about getting the results he has
asked for.

Can't say that I see much value in toys created for the purpose of
reinforcing the brand loyalty of Sheeple 2.0 with regard to whatever
Identity Politics trap they have fallen into.  Of course if you /want/
to deploy a stupidity amplifier, anything that constantly reminds a
True Believer that he or she is better than other people will do the
trick.  Does your bright idea help mutually alienate people who might
otherwise band together to promote their common interests at the
expense of their rulers?  Apply for a grant!
Identity politics works by conditioning people to pin their self
esteem on the inherent superiority of their racial, language,
national, economic, social and/or political in-group.  Strict
compliance with the pseudo-gang's rigid stereotypical beliefs and
behaviors makes the faithful Somebodies, and prevents them from
associating with hated Others.
Like all effective propaganda platforms, identity politics formalizes
and exploits a pre-existing human weakness, in this case the so-called
herd instinct.  Identity politics is maintained and advanced through
strategy that consistently scapegoats and demonizes targeted Others
and, to a lesser extent, anyone else who fails to hear and obey the
correct Party Line.  Logic, reason and practicality are off the table,
although simulating these to provide "proofs" of what Believers
already believe is an important part of the complete and balanced
propaganda breakfast.  It's easy, because all issues are reduced to
binary us versus them issues.  The more valid an evidence based
criticism of any article of faith, the more desperately the true
believer clutches for straws:  It doesn't take much to "rescue" them
from wrong thinking.
Otherwise sane and rational people become easily led animals when they
fall under the spell of identity politics; a high IQ only means
superior internal resources for rationalizing ignorant beliefs.
That's where Knee Jerk Reactionary Republicans, Yellow Dog Democrats
and other packaged personlike Product comes from, and how segmented
markets are herded into battles that assure a populace so divided
against itself that its rulers have a free hand to do whatever they
want unopposed, except by easily marginalized outliers and minorities.
Funny thing:  Lots of readers will agree with the above assessment,
because it applies to ignorant easily led Other People, proving that
their own identity group is better.

It seems to me that high capacity routers would take a performance hit
from the number crunching and caching requirements of semi-anonymizing
all network traffic.  A proposal to redo the whole Internet in some
such protocol would be hard to sell.  People who "want" some measure
of privacy are willing to make cost and performance trade-offs
proportional to their motivation; but bulk data carriers and large
hosting providers are more interested in shaving fractional pennies
off data transactions than in end user privacy.
How much of the network can an adversary see, vs. how big a
performance hit do you need to take to reduce your profile?  Dummy
traffic makes matching the ends of a hidden path orders of magnitude
harder, so the numbers crunched and bandwidth consumed might be an
overall performance tradeoff win.

So I concluded that, despite its major technical superiority to other
anonymized networking protocols, the Mixmaster network was most likely
compromised by passive observation (one owner for a majority of
reliable remailers) and active intervention (traffic between
uncontrolled remailers interrupted in transit).

entirely on how well its users understand both what it does, and what
their potential adversaries can do about it.
Since the Five Eyes & aligned regimes can easily afford to literally
own and monitor a majority of nodes in any distributed anonymous
routing network (ask me about the Hydra protocol), neither TOR nor any
other planned or proposed anonymizing network provides more than fig
leaf security against that particular cluster of adversaries.  The
same goes for BRICS aligned adversaries.  But even against this
category of attack, TOR may be a useful component in a physical
security protocol for hit-and-run network access.  Against less
capable surveillance actors, TOR is "good enough" unless the operating
system it runs on has itself been compromised.
The largest proven security hazard with TOR is that end users will
disclose their identity in the content of cleartext at an exit node,
either literally or by engaging in stereotyped behavior matching a
profile developed from open public sources, i.e. textual analysis
attacks.  No "airtight" security protocol has ever survived contact

relative to top tier State adversaries.

Making users prove they are human without disclosing any personally

The closest the IT industries have come so far is the CAPTCHA.
Automated CAPTCHA breaking methods include forwarding the challenge
image, puzzle or etc. to 3rd party websites where users solve CAPTCHAS
to access content, and submitting those users' solutions back the site
your automated gadget wants to fool.
Routing TOR traffic back and forth across mutually hostile borders
would indeed be easy to do.  It only requires, as Dr. Strangelove
would say, The WILL to do so!
However, this would lead to...
The State Department funds TOR to defeat national firewalls of
"repressive regimes", enabling communication favorable to the U.S.
National Interest. TOR is a two edged sword that can also be used
against the National Interest, so the NSA thinks TOR stinks.  But
apparently State, CIA etc. will not give TOR up, because of its role
in the development and management of dissident groups in countries
slated for destruction.
A really big bump in TOR traffic crossing the borders of "repressive
regimes" could create traffic jams that degrade TOR's performance
right where the State Department wants TOR to work best, and escalate
the arms race between TOR and the operators of national firewall
filters.  This would shift the cost/benefit ratio for TOR's sponsors
in the wrong direction.  Hence "hairball."
One possible solution would be to build privacy directly into Internet
protocols.  That could drive the costs associated with network
surveillance way up compared to today's rates, while making TOR and
etc. redundant.
Of course, every State and Corporate stakeholder will unite against
implementing any such scheme, even if practicable solutions are found.
 But someday, somewhere a window of opportunity might open up, and
meanwhile "there's no such thing as wasted basic research."

Something like that did cross my mind, and I'm glad you expanded on
the theme.  Here we see the difference between a "protocol" as defined
in software, and a "protocol" for face to face human interaction.  In
theory, the approach outlined above would make a network like TOR
orders of magnitude more effective.
But a problem remains:  Software based solutions are easy to deploy,
"just do it."  End users who know something happened (likely a small
minority, unless the changes degrade service) can keep using, drop
out, or fork the project.  Meatspace based solutions are hard:  They
require the informed participation of /numerous/ geographically
dispersed participants.  Compare the case of the PGP web of trust:  It
only works if a critical mass of well informed, proactive end users
make it work.
Getting enough TOR users to do real work in the real world to register
themselves as TOR users sounds like a non-starter to me.

The big error I see is your apparent belief that TOR should be able to
do impossible things, and interpreting its failure to do so as
evidence of malicious intent by its sponsors and developers.
Overly enthusiastic fans of tools like TOR promise "airtight
security," because they believe that airtight security is possible.
Overly enthusiastic critics of TOR and similar tools demand the same
impossible performance, and consider anything less to be a betrayal of
public trust.
One of the most effective ways to defeat a grass roots political
adversary is to build and unleash opposing camps of True Believers to
fight for and against a simplistic, misrepresented version of whatever
the "unwelcome" advocates are trying to accomplish.  What makes this
approach so effective is that people will do it ALL BY THEMSELVES in
many instances; guiding them to do it harder, faster and better is no
challenge at all if one has a budget for that.
I don't imagine that every outspoken critic of my little ideas is a
paid enemy agent; I prefer a more evidence based brand of paranoia.
To me, the tempest in TOR's teacup looks like a perfectly natural
phenomenon, driven by false hope vs. harsh reality problems.  Everyone
has a right to petition the Universe for redress of grievances against
the laws of physics; this can even be productive, as and when it leads

Hash: SHA1

Plus one on that.  Let me get out my Norton II hat & soap box for a
minute here.
Anarchism provides a frame of reference that enables us to understand
how systems of government actually work, and what we can do with and
to them in purely practical terms. Anarchism does not propose a
Utopian system of government to replace the ones already in place, nor
is it a call to "smash the State" and replace it with nothing.
Anarchism describes a group of people who work together for mutual
advantage as a syndicate.  Syndicates organize themselves to develop and
exploit resources for social and economic gain, often in competition
against rival syndicates and among their own membership.
In a stable going concern State, law and public policy are whatever
its dominant syndicates impose by force on the rest of the people in
the territory they control through the State.  In this context force
means applied power, not just physical violence:  Propaganda,
elaborate deceptions and economic incentives do all the heavy lifting.
 Competent State authorities only apply kidnapping and murder when
other methods of manipulation fail:  Violence "is wrong" in the sense
that, except in the context of terrorism (using the threat of violence
to enforce compliant behavior), violence destroys valuable resources
that "should" properly belong to the dominant syndicates.
Anarchists study politics as social power:  Who has it, who does not,
and how these groups interact.  As such, Anarchism provides a frame of
reference for analyzing and comparing various "systems of government"
and for modifying these systems where and as useful opportunities to
do so arise.  A State sanctioned discipline called Human Ecology seeks
to exploit anarchist theory for the exclusive benefit of dominant
Anarchy becomes a visible "force" when and as enough previously
unorganized people push back against State sanctioned syndicates to
forcibly modify those syndicates' behavior.  When dominant syndicates
controlling a State lose touch with reality and exceed the bounds of
their real social power, they may do enough physical and economic harm
to motivate active rebellion among formerly docile State subjects.  At
these times, Anarchists provide propaganda, educational resources, and
facilitation to enable formerly unorganized people to form effective
ad hoc syndicates of their own, and exercise the specific forms of
social and economic power accessible to them.
In the context of political warfare, Anarchism functions as a force
mltiplier:  By themselves, anarchists do not have the material
resource base needed to affect significant changes in the behavior of
State sanctioned syndicates.  But where and as substantial numbers of
disenfranchised people begin to demand social and economic power of
their own, anarchists can facilitate the rapid development of
effective organization, realistic goal setting, and effective action
by those motivated people.  Some call this process Direct Democracy.
As a countermeasure to the potential impact of Anarchist theory and
practice on the behavior of populations dominated by powerful minority
syndicates, State sanctioned propagandists present a fictional version
of Anarchism based on nihilism.  States spare no expense in promoting
and reinforcing a false definition of Anarchy as "violent opposition
to social order of any kind."  Naive self identifying anarchists who
rebel as they are told by State sponsored propagandists provide
"living proof" that the State's definition of Anarchy is correct.  The
well promoted presence of these pseudo-anarchists on mass
communication networks diverts and obstructs public access to
Anarchist resources - except where and as "real" anarchists
effectively weaponize their own understanding of propaganda and
information warfare techniques.
Well that's enough about that for now.

Here's mine:
Over the years three people have told me the same curious story about
how their dog died:  Old and sick, about ready to go, the dog went out
and disappeared:  To be found later, having dug a fairly deep hole in
the ground some distance away from the house, backed into it, and died
there.  None of these animals was "in the habit" of digging holes and
camping there.
An animal that is about to die will not reproduce.  That beast has
already been dealt out of the game.  Yet somehow, the domesticated
canine has acquired a genetic program for a solitary funeral rite:  A
practical one, that inhibits the spread of disease and minimizes
attraction of scavengers etc. to the site.  How is that possible?
The all-conquering Dominant Individual may or may not contribute to
the survival of a community that includes his or her own offspring.
But the individual whose behavior actually does contribute to the
survival of that community increases the odds of his or her
descendants out-competing those of other local communities.  Add
massively iterated trial and error and viola:  Whatever neurophysical
mechanism inspires a dying dog to do that unlikely ritual became a
factory stock feature in the canine world.
The recently popular book Sex At Dawn includes a fatal critique of
"what we think we know" about those horrible killer apes whose example
supposedly explains and excuses human ultra-violence.  Among other
examples, it turns out that foraging apes, when presented with a
single super high value food source daily by anthropologists who want
to study them, do begin to fight over control of that pile of fruit.
The most dominant individuals "would rather let it rot" than allow
others to share it:  A massively iterated genetic trial and error
process prepared them to defend high value food items "as if" there
was only enough for one or two individuals - because that is usually
true of "rare goodies" found while foraging.  But meanwhile, when
observed foraging in the wild, members of the same species tend to
announce their finds to attract others to areas where more goodies are
likely to be found, by bragging on the way cool find /they/ own.
Among Homo Saps, the massive advantages of language and technology
have given a free ride to individuals who get top marks in
intelligence, strength and psychopathy.  They organize for mutual
advantage and spread their contra-survival social traits through the
population like a wildfire.  Thanks to abstract language, the capacity
to lie gives them a powerful arsenal of behavioral manipulation
techniques and they will seize on any opportunity to rationalize and
glorify their violent behavior.  Their cult of the "rugged individual"
and deification of those who accumulate the most wealth and power at
the expense of the community has yet to be bred out of the human
species by massively iterated trial and error.

In regions where the climate tries to kill everyone for months on end
every year, "common sense" social behavior and resulting cultural
norms benefit from a massively iterated sorting process; those who are
naturally inclined toward cooperation and a reasonable amount of
self-sacrifice tend to outlive those who are not so inclined.  Given
enough time this sorting process will affect the physical genome as
well as the implicit semantic content of "culture."

Control had a portable version of the cone of silence - basically two

on the Chief's head then ended up shattered the first time it was deployed.
I have come to realize the Agent 86 may have been the greatest
intelligence officer of his generation:  That is if, as I now suspect,
he was working for Kaos all along.  Smart wasted vast amounts of
Control's money, misdirected 100% of its manpower and resources toward a
crew of small time losers who were probably a KGB front set up for the
purpose, and completely demoralized Control's Chief and (all but one of)
his fellow Agents.  And they fell for it.  To such an extent that
Control went out of business for good just five years after Smart showed
up on the record as its "top Agent."

The "conspiracy theory" meme was widely circulated by the CIA in a
1967 memo to its private sector press agents titled “Countering
Criticism of the Warren Commission Report,” advising them in detail on
how to assist in the suppression of independent investigation of the
JFK murder.  This document was released in 1976 in response to a New
York Times FOIA filing, as CIA Document 1035-960.
"Innuendo of such seriousness affects not only the individual
concerned, but also the whole reputation of the American government.
Our organization itself is directly involved: among other facts, we
contributed information to the investigation. Conspiracy theories have
frequently thrown suspicion on our organization, for example by
falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us. The aim of this
dispatch is to provide material countering and discrediting the claims
of the conspiracy theorists, so as to inhibit the circulation of such
claims in other countries. Background information is supplied in a
classified section and in a number of unclassified attachments."
The agency also directed its members “to employ propaganda assets to
[negate] and refute the attacks of the critics. Book reviews and
feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose.”

Today, State sponsored propagandists have embraced the cottage
industry promoting "conspiracy theories" on the Internet as an
effective weapon of information warfare.  Although the Internet makes
censorship of unwelcome information difficult or impossible once it is
in circulation, staining such information with the taint of "lunatick

describing the same subject matter, and assure that they are
prominently featured and vigorously promoted by click bait website

What is truth?
Pilate asked this question to underline the fact that in his house, his
words were true simply because he said them.  That's a fringe benefit of
working under authority granted by a living God, i.e. the Roman Emperor.
Truth in the common, everyday sense means honest reporting. "Telling the
truth" is no guarantee of factual accuracy per evidence unknown to the
speaker, or reasoning not used by the speaker, but a best effort by all
involved leads to useful results.  An engineer might say that truth is
whatever concepts and data provide maximum practical utility.
Propagandists take a very utilitarian approach since manufacturing truth
is their stock in trade.  Professionals in that field have no delusion
that truth cam exist independently of the interests it serves.
In formal games including maths, truth is whatever complies with the
rules of the game.  Among my favorite "truths" is the family of logical
statements that are both true (well formed) and self contradictory, i.e.
Goedel's incompleteness theorem.  These formally provable truths pop the
bubble of "objectivity," leaving us in a world where, at best, truth is
context-dependent and strictly local.
Another way to look at truth is in the context of "authenticity."  Is a
given person "true to" his or herself?  Conscious of the role of the
individual as an active participant in creating truth?  This take on
truth puts it in the same bucket as freedom and beauty; the stuff of
art, not science.

It seems to me that high capacity routers would take a performance hit
from the number crunching and caching requirements of semi-anonymizing
all network traffic.  A proposal to redo the whole Internet in some
such protocol would be hard to sell.  People who "want" some measure
of privacy are willing to make cost and performance trade-offs
proportional to their motivation; but bulk data carriers and large
hosting providers are more interested in shaving fractional pennies
off data transactions than in end user privacy.
How much of the network can an adversary see, vs. how big a
performance hit do you need to take to reduce your profile?  Dummy
traffic makes matching the ends of a hidden path orders of magnitude
harder, so the numbers crunched and bandwidth consumed might be an
overall performance tradeoff win.

Anonymized routing protocols are designed to defeat passive

what if an effectively unlimited number of compromised routers,
subject to realtime observation and internal manipulation, were
available to hostile actors?  Game over, I think.
About 15 years ago I used online traceroute utilities and whois
lookups to determine (roughly) where all the high performing Mixmaster
remailers were physically located.  Over half of them, including most
with "exotic sounding" TLDs, were apparently in the state of Texas.
Then I used my data to construct "hard to compromise" chains, routing
Mixmaster messages through national jurisdictions not likely to have
comprehensive data sharing between their security services, and
started sending test messages.  None of these test messages ever made
it back to me.
So I concluded that, despite its major technical superiority to other
anonymized networking protocols, the Mixmaster network was most likely
compromised by passive observation (one owner for a majority of
reliable remailers) and active intervention (traffic between
uncontrolled remailers interrupted in transit).
Owning enough of the routers in an anonymizing network to negate its
security is largely a question of money:  How much budget to you have,
how certain do you want to be that nobody is really anonymous?
If I had to neutralize an anonymous routing network, my approach would
be to set up a cloud server running thousands of instances of the

hypervisor.  Each of these routers would be connected via VPN to a
unique remote host, which would function as a transparent proxy.  The
proxy hosts could be machines owned by "friendly" actors, rooted
consumer grade routers, purpose built appliances, conventional Windows
botnets or some combination of these.
I have not seen this method of attack described and named; I call it a
"hydra" attack, because one body, many heads.  I think this mode of
attack deserves competent attention (i.e., not by me) because realtime

provide solutions to any distributed anonymous routing protocol.
The only defence I can think of is to assure that message traffic
passes back and forth between mutually hostile national jurisdictions
before delivery.  This would be a bit of a hairball to implement, lots
of slippery variables and potential counter-actions by hostiles would

views are dead wrong.  Whether TOR is harmful or helpful depends
entirely on how well its users understand both what it does, and what
their potential adversaries can do about it.
Since the Five Eyes & aligned regimes can easily afford to literally
own and monitor a majority of nodes in any distributed anonymous
routing network (ask me about the Hydra protocol), neither TOR nor any
other planned or proposed anonymizing network provides more than fig
leaf security against that particular cluster of adversaries.  The
same goes for BRICS aligned adversaries.  But even against this
category of attack, TOR may be a useful component in a physical
security protocol for hit-and-run network access.  Against less
capable surveillance actors, TOR is "good enough" unless the operating
system it runs on has itself been compromised.
The largest proven security hazard with TOR is that end users will
disclose their identity in the content of cleartext at an exit node,
either literally or by engaging in stereotyped behavior matching a
profile developed from open public sources, i.e. textual analysis
attacks.  No "airtight" security protocol has ever survived contact

Making users prove they are human without disclosing any personally

Automated CAPTCHA breaking methods include forwarding the challenge
image, puzzle or etc. to 3rd party websites where users solve CAPTCHAS
to access content, and submitting those users' solutions back the site
your automated gadget wants to fool.
Routing TOR traffic back and forth across mutually hostile borders
would indeed be easy to do.  It only requires, as Dr. Strangelove
would say, The WILL to do so!
However, this would lead to...
The State Department funds TOR to defeat national firewalls of
"repressive regimes", enabling communication favorable to the U.S.
National Interest. TOR is a two edged sword that can also be used
against the National Interest, so the NSA thinks TOR stinks.  But
apparently State, CIA etc. will not give TOR up, because of its role
in the development and management of dissident groups in countries
slated for destruction.
A really big bump in TOR traffic crossing the borders of "repressive
regimes" could create traffic jams that degrade TOR's performance
right where the State Department wants TOR to work best, and escalate
the arms race between TOR and the operators of national firewall
filters.  This would shift the cost/benefit ratio for TOR's sponsors
in the wrong direction.  Hence "hairball."
One possible solution would be to build privacy directly into Internet
protocols.  That could drive the costs associated with network
surveillance way up compared to today's rates, while making TOR and
etc. redundant.
Of course, every State and Corporate stakeholder will unite against
implementing any such scheme, even if practicable solutions are found.
 But someday, somewhere a window of opportunity might open up, and
meanwhile "there's no such thing as wasted basic research."

Something like that did cross my mind, and I'm glad you expanded on
the theme.  Here we see the difference between a "protocol" as defined
in software, and a "protocol" for face to face human interaction.  In
theory, the approach outlined above would make a network like TOR
orders of magnitude more effective.
But a problem remains:  Software based solutions are easy to deploy,
"just do it."  End users who know something happened (likely a small
minority, unless the changes degrade service) can keep using, drop
out, or fork the project.  Meatspace based solutions are hard:  They
require the informed participation of /numerous/ geographically
dispersed participants.  Compare the case of the PGP web of trust:  It
only works if a critical mass of well informed, proactive end users
make it work.
Getting enough TOR users to do real work in the real world to register

The big error I see is your apparent belief that TOR should be able to
do impossible things, and interpreting its failure to do so as
evidence of malicious intent by its sponsors and developers.
Overly enthusiastic fans of tools like TOR promise "airtight
security," because they believe that airtight security is possible.
Overly enthusiastic critics of TOR and similar tools demand the same
impossible performance, and consider anything less to be a betrayal of
public trust.
One of the most effective ways to defeat a grass roots political
adversary is to build and unleash opposing camps of True Believers to
fight for and against a simplistic, misrepresented version of whatever
the "unwelcome" advocates are trying to accomplish.  What makes this

many instances; guiding them to do it harder, faster and better is no
challenge at all if one has a budget for that.
I don't imagine that every outspoken critic of my little ideas is a

Hash: SHA1

Plus one on that.  Let me get out my Norton II hat & soap box for a
minute here.
Anarchism provides a frame of reference that enables us to understand
how systems of government actually work, and what we can do with and
to them in purely practical terms. Anarchism does not propose a
Utopian system of government to replace the ones already in place, nor
is it a call to "smash the State" and replace it with nothing.
Anarchism describes a group of people who work together for mutual
advantage as a syndicate.  Syndicates organize themselves to develop and
exploit resources for social and economic gain, often in competition
against rival syndicates and among their own membership.
In a stable going concern State, law and public policy are whatever
its dominant syndicates impose by force on the rest of the people in
the territory they control through the State.  In this context force
means applied power, not just physical violence:  Propaganda,
elaborate deceptions and economic incentives do all the heavy lifting.
 Competent State authorities only apply kidnapping and murder when
other methods of manipulation fail:  Violence "is wrong" in the sense
that, except in the context of terrorism (using the threat of violence
to enforce compliant behavior), violence destroys valuable resources
that "should" properly belong to the dominant syndicates.
Anarchists study politics as social power:  Who has it, who does not,
and how these groups interact.  As such, Anarchism provides a frame of
reference for analyzing and comparing various "systems of government"
and for modifying these systems where and as useful opportunities to
do so arise.  A State sanctioned discipline called Human Ecology seeks
to exploit anarchist theory for the exclusive benefit of dominant
Anarchy becomes a visible "force" when and as enough previously
unorganized people push back against State sanctioned syndicates to
forcibly modify those syndicates' behavior.  When dominant syndicates
controlling a State lose touch with reality and exceed the bounds of
their real social power, they may do enough physical and economic harm
to motivate active rebellion among formerly docile State subjects.  At
these times, Anarchists provide propaganda, educational resources, and
facilitation to enable formerly unorganized people to form effective
ad hoc syndicates of their own, and exercise the specific forms of
social and economic power accessible to them.
In the context of political warfare, Anarchism functions as a force
mltiplier:  By themselves, anarchists do not have the material
resource base needed to affect significant changes in the behavior of
State sanctioned syndicates.  But where and as substantial numbers of
disenfranchised people begin to demand social and economic power of
their own, anarchists can facilitate the rapid development of
effective organization, realistic goal setting, and effective action
by those motivated people.  Some call this process Direct Democracy.
As a countermeasure to the potential impact of Anarchist theory and
practice on the behavior of populations dominated by powerful minority
syndicates, State sanctioned propagandists present a fictional version
of Anarchism based on nihilism.  States spare no expense in promoting
and reinforcing a false definition of Anarchy as "violent opposition
to social order of any kind."  Naive self identifying anarchists who
rebel as they are told by State sponsored propagandists provide
"living proof" that the State's definition of Anarchy is correct.  The
well promoted presence of these pseudo-anarchists on mass
communication networks diverts and obstructs public access to
Anarchist resources - except where and as "real" anarchists
effectively weaponize their own understanding of propaganda and
information warfare techniques.
Well that's enough about that for now.

Over the years three people have told me the same curious story about
how their dog died:  Old and sick, about ready to go, the dog went out
and disappeared:  To be found later, having dug a fairly deep hole in
the ground some distance away from the house, backed into it, and died
there.  None of these animals was "in the habit" of digging holes and
camping there.
An animal that is about to die will not reproduce.  That beast has
already been dealt out of the game.  Yet somehow, the domesticated
canine has acquired a genetic program for a solitary funeral rite:  A
practical one, that inhibits the spread of disease and minimizes
attraction of scavengers etc. to the site.  How is that possible?
The all-conquering Dominant Individual may or may not contribute to
the survival of a community that includes his or her own offspring.
But the individual whose behavior actually does contribute to the
survival of that community increases the odds of his or her
descendants out-competing those of other local communities.  Add
massively iterated trial and error and viola:  Whatever neurophysical
mechanism inspires a dying dog to do that unlikely ritual became a
factory stock feature in the canine world.
The recently popular book Sex At Dawn includes a fatal critique of
"what we think we know" about those horrible killer apes whose example
supposedly explains and excuses human ultra-violence.  Among other
examples, it turns out that foraging apes, when presented with a
single super high value food source daily by anthropologists who want
to study them, do begin to fight over control of that pile of fruit.
The most dominant individuals "would rather let it rot" than allow
others to share it:  A massively iterated genetic trial and error
process prepared them to defend high value food items "as if" there
was only enough for one or two individuals - because that is usually
true of "rare goodies" found while foraging.  But meanwhile, when
observed foraging in the wild, members of the same species tend to
announce their finds to attract others to areas where more goodies are
likely to be found, by bragging on the way cool find /they/ own.
Among Homo Saps, the massive advantages of language and technology
have given a free ride to individuals who get top marks in
intelligence, strength and psychopathy.  They organize for mutual
advantage and spread their contra-survival social traits through the
population like a wildfire.  Thanks to abstract language, the capacity
to lie gives them a powerful arsenal of behavioral manipulation

My take-away:
"The notion of retaliation, as such, is absent from Russian folklore,
as if it were never part of the original 'genetic code' of its people
­ the Russian champion has always gone to war as a liberator."
In regions where the climate tries to kill everyone for months on end
every year, "common sense" social behavior and resulting cultural
norms benefit from a massively iterated sorting process; those who are
naturally inclined toward cooperation and a reasonable amount of
self-sacrifice tend to outlive those who are not so inclined.  Given
enough time this sorting process will affect the physical genome as
well as the implicit semantic content of "culture."
Bad weather makes good neighbors.  I have been saying this since I was
a teenager, having by then lived in a range of locations from tropical
to sub-arctic.
Of course there are a lot of other variables.  Civilization so-called
is pure poison to the human spirit as well as the natural world it
exploits, ruins and discards in the name of Progress.  The pervasive
propaganda narrative describing Western civilization as the ascent of
Man from barbarous savagery to nobility and enlightenment may be the
biggest Big Lie ever told.

The "conspiracy theory" meme was widely circulated by the CIA in a

how to assist in the suppression of independent investigation of the
JFK murder.  This document was released in 1976 in response to a New
York Times FOIA filing, as CIA Document 1035-960.
"Innuendo of such seriousness affects not only the individual
concerned, but also the whole reputation of the American government.
Our organization itself is directly involved: among other facts, we
contributed information to the investigation. Conspiracy theories have
frequently thrown suspicion on our organization, for example by
falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us. The aim of this
dispatch is to provide material countering and discrediting the claims
of the conspiracy theorists, so as to inhibit the circulation of such
claims in other countries. Background information is supplied in a
classified section and in a number of unclassified attachments."
The agency also directed its members “to employ propaganda assets to

feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose.”

What is truth?
Pilate asked this question to underline the fact that in his house, his
words were true simply because he said them.  That's a fringe benefit of
working under authority granted by a living God, i.e. the Roman Emperor.
Truth in the common, everyday sense means honest reporting. "Telling the
truth" is no guarantee of factual accuracy per evidence unknown to the
speaker, or reasoning not used by the speaker, but a best effort by all
involved leads to useful results.  An engineer might say that truth is
whatever concepts and data provide maximum practical utility.
Propagandists take a very utilitarian approach since manufacturing truth
is their stock in trade.  Professionals in that field have no delusion
that truth cam exist independently of the interests it serves.
In formal games including maths, truth is whatever complies with the
rules of the game.  Among my favorite "truths" is the family of logical
statements that are both true (well formed) and self contradictory, i.e.
Goedel's incompleteness theorem.  These formally provable truths pop the
bubble of "objectivity," leaving us in a world where, at best, truth is
context-dependent and strictly local.
Another way to look at truth is in the context of "authenticity."  Is a
given person "true to" his or herself?  Conscious of the role of the
individual as an active participant in creating truth?  This take on
truth puts it in the same bucket as freedom and beauty; the stuff of
art, not science.

It seems to me that high capacity routers would take a performance hit
from the number crunching and caching requirements of semi-anonymizing
all network traffic.  A proposal to redo the whole Internet in some
such protocol would be hard to sell.  People who "want" some measure
of privacy are willing to make cost and performance trade-offs
proportional to their motivation; but bulk data carriers and large
hosting providers are more interested in shaving fractional pennies
off data transactions than in end user privacy.
How much of the network can an adversary see, vs. how big a
performance hit do you need to take to reduce your profile?  Dummy
traffic makes matching the ends of a hidden path orders of magnitude
harder, so the numbers crunched and bandwidth consumed might be an
overall performance tradeoff win.

Anonymized routing protocols are designed to defeat passive
observation and limited traffic manipulation by hostile actors.  But
what if an effectively unlimited number of compromised routers,
subject to realtime observation and internal manipulation, were
available to hostile actors?  Game over, I think.
About 15 years ago I used online traceroute utilities and whois
lookups to determine (roughly) where all the high performing Mixmaster
remailers were physically located.  Over half of them, including most
with "exotic sounding" TLDs, were apparently in the state of Texas.
Then I used my data to construct "hard to compromise" chains, routing
Mixmaster messages through national jurisdictions not likely to have
comprehensive data sharing between their security services, and
started sending test messages.  None of these test messages ever made
it back to me.
So I concluded that, despite its major technical superiority to other
anonymized networking protocols, the Mixmaster network was most likely
compromised by passive observation (one owner for a majority of
reliable remailers) and active intervention (traffic between
uncontrolled remailers interrupted in transit).
Owning enough of the routers in an anonymizing network to negate its
security is largely a question of money:  How much budget to you have,
how certain do you want to be that nobody is really anonymous?
If I had to neutralize an anonymous routing network, my approach would
be to set up a cloud server running thousands of instances of the
router software in question, customized to facilitate monitoring by a
hypervisor.  Each of these routers would be connected via VPN to a
unique remote host, which would function as a transparent proxy.  The
proxy hosts could be machines owned by "friendly" actors, rooted
consumer grade routers, purpose built appliances, conventional Windows
botnets or some combination of these.
I have not seen this method of attack described and named; I call it a
"hydra" attack, because one body, many heads.  I think this mode of
attack deserves competent attention (i.e., not by me) because realtime
observation and manipulation of any desired quantity of routers would
provide solutions to any distributed anonymous routing protocol.
The only defence I can think of is to assure that message traffic
passes back and forth between mutually hostile national jurisdictions
before delivery.  This would be a bit of a hairball to implement, lots
of slippery variables and potential counter-actions by hostiles would
have to be taken into account.  But this approach could increase the

views are dead wrong.  Whether TOR is harmful or helpful depends
entirely on how well its users understand both what it does, and what
their potential adversaries can do about it.
Since the Five Eyes & aligned regimes can easily afford to literally
own and monitor a majority of nodes in any distributed anonymous
routing network (ask me about the Hydra protocol), neither TOR nor any
other planned or proposed anonymizing network provides more than fig
leaf security against that particular cluster of adversaries.  The
same goes for BRICS aligned adversaries.  But even against this
category of attack, TOR may be a useful component in a physical
security protocol for hit-and-run network access.  Against less
capable surveillance actors, TOR is "good enough" unless the operating
system it runs on has itself been compromised.
The largest proven security hazard with TOR is that end users will
disclose their identity in the content of cleartext at an exit node,
either literally or by engaging in stereotyped behavior matching a
profile developed from open public sources, i.e. textual analysis
attacks.  No "airtight" security protocol has ever survived contact

Routing TOR traffic back and forth across mutually hostile borders
would indeed be easy to do.  It only requires, as Dr. Strangelove
would say, The WILL to do so!
However, this would lead to...
The State Department funds TOR to defeat national firewalls of
"repressive regimes", enabling communication favorable to the U.S.
National Interest. TOR is a two edged sword that can also be used
against the National Interest, so the NSA thinks TOR stinks.  But
apparently State, CIA etc. will not give TOR up, because of its role
in the development and management of dissident groups in countries
slated for destruction.
A really big bump in TOR traffic crossing the borders of "repressive
regimes" could create traffic jams that degrade TOR's performance
right where the State Department wants TOR to work best, and escalate
the arms race between TOR and the operators of national firewall
filters.  This would shift the cost/benefit ratio for TOR's sponsors
in the wrong direction.  Hence "hairball."
One possible solution would be to build privacy directly into Internet
protocols.  That could drive the costs associated with network
surveillance way up compared to today's rates, while making TOR and

Of course, every State and Corporate stakeholder will unite against
implementing any such scheme, even if practicable solutions are found.

Something like that did cross my mind, and I'm glad you expanded on
the theme.  Here we see the difference between a "protocol" as defined
in software, and a "protocol" for face to face human interaction.  In
theory, the approach outlined above would make a network like TOR
orders of magnitude more effective.
But a problem remains:  Software based solutions are easy to deploy,
"just do it."  End users who know something happened (likely a small
minority, unless the changes degrade service) can keep using, drop
out, or fork the project.  Meatspace based solutions are hard:  They
require the informed participation of /numerous/ geographically
dispersed participants.  Compare the case of the PGP web of trust:  It
only works if a critical mass of well informed, proactive end users
make it work.

evidence of malicious intent by its sponsors and developers.
Overly enthusiastic fans of tools like TOR promise "airtight
security," because they believe that airtight security is possible.
Overly enthusiastic critics of TOR and similar tools demand the same
impossible performance, and consider anything less to be a betrayal of

Hash: SHA1

Plus one on that.  Let me get out my Norton II hat & soap box for a
minute here.
Anarchism provides a frame of reference that enables us to understand
how systems of government actually work, and what we can do with and
to them in purely practical terms. Anarchism does not propose a
Utopian system of government to replace the ones already in place, nor
is it a call to "smash the State" and replace it with nothing.
Anarchism describes a group of people who work together for mutual
advantage as a syndicate.  Syndicates organize themselves to develop and
exploit resources for social and economic gain, often in competition
against rival syndicates and among their own membership.
In a stable going concern State, law and public policy are whatever
its dominant syndicates impose by force on the rest of the people in
the territory they control through the State.  In this context force
means applied power, not just physical violence:  Propaganda,
elaborate deceptions and economic incentives do all the heavy lifting.
 Competent State authorities only apply kidnapping and murder when
other methods of manipulation fail:  Violence "is wrong" in the sense
that, except in the context of terrorism (using the threat of violence
to enforce compliant behavior), violence destroys valuable resources
that "should" properly belong to the dominant syndicates.
Anarchists study politics as social power:  Who has it, who does not,
and how these groups interact.  As such, Anarchism provides a frame of
reference for analyzing and comparing various "systems of government"
and for modifying these systems where and as useful opportunities to
do so arise.  A State sanctioned discipline called Human Ecology seeks
to exploit anarchist theory for the exclusive benefit of dominant
Anarchy becomes a visible "force" when and as enough previously
unorganized people push back against State sanctioned syndicates to
forcibly modify those syndicates' behavior.  When dominant syndicates
controlling a State lose touch with reality and exceed the bounds of
their real social power, they may do enough physical and economic harm
to motivate active rebellion among formerly docile State subjects.  At
these times, Anarchists provide propaganda, educational resources, and
facilitation to enable formerly unorganized people to form effective
ad hoc syndicates of their own, and exercise the specific forms of
social and economic power accessible to them.
In the context of political warfare, Anarchism functions as a force
mltiplier:  By themselves, anarchists do not have the material
resource base needed to affect significant changes in the behavior of
State sanctioned syndicates.  But where and as substantial numbers of
disenfranchised people begin to demand social and economic power of
their own, anarchists can facilitate the rapid development of
effective organization, realistic goal setting, and effective action
by those motivated people.  Some call this process Direct Democracy.
As a countermeasure to the potential impact of Anarchist theory and
practice on the behavior of populations dominated by powerful minority
syndicates, State sanctioned propagandists present a fictional version
of Anarchism based on nihilism.  States spare no expense in promoting
and reinforcing a false definition of Anarchy as "violent opposition
to social order of any kind."  Naive self identifying anarchists who
rebel as they are told by State sponsored propagandists provide
"living proof" that the State's definition of Anarchy is correct.  The
well promoted presence of these pseudo-anarchists on mass
communication networks diverts and obstructs public access to
Anarchist resources - except where and as "real" anarchists
effectively weaponize their own understanding of propaganda and
information warfare techniques.

Here's mine:
Over the years three people have told me the same curious story about
how their dog died:  Old and sick, about ready to go, the dog went out
and disappeared:  To be found later, having dug a fairly deep hole in
the ground some distance away from the house, backed into it, and died
there.  None of these animals was "in the habit" of digging holes and
camping there.
An animal that is about to die will not reproduce.  That beast has
already been dealt out of the game.  Yet somehow, the domesticated
canine has acquired a genetic program for a solitary funeral rite:  A
practical one, that inhibits the spread of disease and minimizes
attraction of scavengers etc. to the site.  How is that possible?
The all-conquering Dominant Individual may or may not contribute to
the survival of a community that includes his or her own offspring.
But the individual whose behavior actually does contribute to the
survival of that community increases the odds of his or her
descendants out-competing those of other local communities.  Add
massively iterated trial and error and viola:  Whatever neurophysical
mechanism inspires a dying dog to do that unlikely ritual became a
factory stock feature in the canine world.
The recently popular book Sex At Dawn includes a fatal critique of
"what we think we know" about those horrible killer apes whose example
supposedly explains and excuses human ultra-violence.  Among other
examples, it turns out that foraging apes, when presented with a
single super high value food source daily by anthropologists who want
to study them, do begin to fight over control of that pile of fruit.
The most dominant individuals "would rather let it rot" than allow
others to share it:  A massively iterated genetic trial and error
process prepared them to defend high value food items "as if" there
was only enough for one or two individuals - because that is usually
true of "rare goodies" found while foraging.  But meanwhile, when
observed foraging in the wild, members of the same species tend to
announce their finds to attract others to areas where more goodies are
likely to be found, by bragging on the way cool find /they/ own.
Among Homo Saps, the massive advantages of language and technology
have given a free ride to individuals who get top marks in
intelligence, strength and psychopathy.  They organize for mutual
advantage and spread their contra-survival social traits through the
population like a wildfire.  Thanks to abstract language, the capacity
to lie gives them a powerful arsenal of behavioral manipulation
techniques and they will seize on any opportunity to rationalize and
glorify their violent behavior.  Their cult of the "rugged individual"
and deification of those who accumulate the most wealth and power at
the expense of the community has yet to be bred out of the human
species by massively iterated trial and error.
One of these days I'm gonna create a propaganda poster modeled on the
heroic art of the NSDAP, featuring our favorite Objectivist, with the
inspirational slogan:  "Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ayn Rand."

My take-away:
"The notion of retaliation, as such, is absent from Russian folklore,
as if it were never part of the original 'genetic code' of its people
­ the Russian champion has always gone to war as a liberator."
In regions where the climate tries to kill everyone for months on end
every year, "common sense" social behavior and resulting cultural
norms benefit from a massively iterated sorting process; those who are
naturally inclined toward cooperation and a reasonable amount of
self-sacrifice tend to outlive those who are not so inclined.  Given
enough time this sorting process will affect the physical genome as
well as the implicit semantic content of "culture."
Bad weather makes good neighbors.  I have been saying this since I was
a teenager, having by then lived in a range of locations from tropical
to sub-arctic.
Of course there are a lot of other variables.  Civilization so-called
is pure poison to the human spirit as well as the natural world it
exploits, ruins and discards in the name of Progress.  The pervasive
propaganda narrative describing Western civilization as the ascent of
Man from barbarous savagery to nobility and enlightenment may be the
biggest Big Lie ever told.

The "conspiracy theory" meme was widely circulated by the CIA in a
1967 memo to its private sector press agents titled “Countering
Criticism of the Warren Commission Report,” advising them in detail on
how to assist in the suppression of independent investigation of the
JFK murder.  This document was released in 1976 in response to a New
York Times FOIA filing, as CIA Document 1035-960.
"Innuendo of such seriousness affects not only the individual
concerned, but also the whole reputation of the American government.
Our organization itself is directly involved: among other facts, we
contributed information to the investigation. Conspiracy theories have
frequently thrown suspicion on our organization, for example by
falsely alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald worked for us. The aim of this
dispatch is to provide material countering and discrediting the claims
of the conspiracy theorists, so as to inhibit the circulation of such
claims in other countries. Background information is supplied in a
classified section and in a number of unclassified attachments."
The agency also directed its members “to employ propaganda assets to
[negate] and refute the attacks of the critics. Book reviews and
feature articles are particularly appropriate for this purpose.”

Today, State sponsored propagandists have embraced the cottage

censorship of unwelcome information difficult or impossible once it is

What is truth?
Pilate asked this question to underline the fact that in his house, his
words were true simply because he said them.  That's a fringe benefit of
working under authority granted by a living God, i.e. the Roman Emperor.
Truth in the common, everyday sense means honest reporting. "Telling the
truth" is no guarantee of factual accuracy per evidence unknown to the
speaker, or reasoning not used by the speaker, but a best effort by all
involved leads to useful results.  An engineer might say that truth is
whatever concepts and data provide maximum practical utility.
Propagandists take a very utilitarian approach since manufacturing truth
is their stock in trade.  Professionals in that field have no delusion
that truth cam exist independently of the interests it serves.
In formal games including maths, truth is whatever complies with the
rules of the game.  Among my favorite "truths" is the family of logical
statements that are both true (well formed) and self contradictory, i.e.
Goedel's incompleteness theorem.  These formally provable truths pop the
bubble of "objectivity," leaving us in a world where, at best, truth is
context-dependent and strictly local.
Another way to look at truth is in the context of "authenticity."  Is a
given person "true to" his or herself?  Conscious of the role of the
individual as an active participant in creating truth?  This take on
truth puts it in the same bucket as freedom and beauty; the stuff of
art, not science.

Crazy?  More like far out.
Universal surveillance enables abuses of State power only when
access to collected data is restricted to State sanctioned actors.
 When everything becomes searchable by anybody, the inability of
State sanctioned actors to conceal their activities or effectively
lie about their history and motives will inhibit their potential
for destructive action.  "Power over others" depends in large part
on secrecy, while "powers of self determination" depend largely on
free and open access to information.
In the long run, the secrecy problem will take care of itself,
because the abuses of power it enables have already killed the
State:  At least, in the sense that a trans-national State hard
wired for self destruction, defending that program by any means
necessary, is "already dead."

Hash: SHA1
An independent audit found a substantial deficiency in one of the
dependencies of the SecureDrop document submission / management
protocol.  SecureDrop gave the devs time to fix it before
publishing, but so far the issue remains unresolved:
Publishing the unredacted SecureDrop 0.3.4 audit report
vs. SecureDrop uses OSSEC, a popular open source host-based intrusion
detection system (HIDS). The OSSEC architecture consists of a
single central server, called the Manager, which monitors one or
more systems. The monitored systems have programs called Agents,
which collect a variety of information and forward it to the
Manager for analysis and correlation.
The Manager and the Agents may communicate with one of two
protocols: "syslog" or "secure". The "secure" protocol is a custom
crypto protocol based on shared secret keys that are set up during
OSSEC deployment. NCC Group reviewed the custom protocol and found
two serious issues in its cryptographic design:
    Protocol messages are encrypted with the shared secret key
using Blowfish in CBC mode. Unfortunately, the protocol uses a
static initialization vector (IV) to encrypt and decrypt all
messages. This essentially reduces CBC mode to ECB mode and fails
to achieve semantic security.
    Protocol messages are not authenticated. Each message includes
an MD5 hash of the plaintext payload with the encrypted content,
but this is not a strong authenticator. Among other things, it
violates Moxie Marlinspike's "Cryptographic Doom Principle".
For more detail, see the finding in the unredacted audit report.
NCC Group did not take the time to investigate a proof of concept
(PoC) attack based on this vulnerability, but that is not
surprising given the limited duration of their engagement and the
fact that their focus was on SecureDrop, not OSSEC. Nonetheless,
these are serious cryptographic design flaws that could lead to a
practical attack in the future. We encourage all OSSEC users to
examine their current deployments, consider the level of exposure
of any OSSEC "secure" protocol traffic to potential adversaries,
and make changes accordingly.

"The guns" tend to backfire:  Common or garden variety capital
murders by police officers in the U.S. has re-ignited the Civil
Rights movement, for example.  Putting that big black genii back
in the bottle is a job for covert political warfare via
propaganda, deception and PsyOps.
The outcome of every revolution I have studied was determined
before the first shot was fired.  The real damage enabled by mass
surveillance in State and Corporate hands includes:
Fine tuning and targeting of propaganda in near realtime to
achieve maximum influence.
Early detection and proactive response to disrupt and co-opt
"trending" populist and radical factions.
Automated social network mapping and behavior analysis in support
of political warfare.
Not so much Joe Six Pack as Jane Citizen Journalist.  Up to a
point of diminishing returns, every time "the guns" are used
against her, a dozen more of her appear.  As the point of
diminishing returns for that function approaches, civil uprisings
in response to State violence become likely.
The most important single item of State propaganda against
populist and radical politics:  Power over others depends on guns.
Any challenge to State power that depends primarily on armed
conflict has a single, certain outcome:  Victory for the State.
Again, the outcome of a revolution is determined before the first
shot is fired.  Building a large base of popular support and a
network of ideologically committed cadres is the key to success,
and the principal objective of State political warfare is to
prevent this from happening.
Naive wannabe anarchists who want to "go directly to guns, do not

Lemme drag out my soap box...
I have a three point plan for safe nuclear power:
1)  Repeal the industry's blanket immunity from prosecution for
civil liabilities.  If it's so safe, why do the owners need to be
above the law?
2)  Remove the industry's public funding, which presently includes
massive subsidies on many fronts.  If it's such a freakin'
technology miracle, it can pay for itself.
3)  Open source every detail of design, construction, operation,
QA and safety inspection, and decommissioning of nuclear power
plants and their inputs/ouputs (fuel, waste), with publication as
near to realtime as materially possible.  Near-miss and slow-leak
containment breaches due to noncompliance with inspection
schedules need to just go away.
In the United States, compliance with part 1 would end all
investment in, and operation of, nuclear power plants:  No
investor or insurance provider will underwrite a nuclear power
plant's exposure under equally applied tort law.
Compliance with part 2 would disentangle the nuclear power
industry from the nuclear warhead and military reactor industry,
its de facto sponsor and sugar daddy - as well as removing tax
incentives and "free money" awarded by Utilities Commissions.  No
free ride on the public's nickel means no nuclear power industry,
balance-sheet wise.
Part 3, which invokes "many eyeballs" to assure maybe just barely
safe enough for optimists safety, would unleash a massive
shitstorm/clusterfuck of commercial and military secrecy issues,
and require extraordinary budgets for QA compliance and reporting.
 Oops, that too should be enough by itself to shut the industry down
Me no rikey nuclear electric power plants.  The Obama
Administration's firmly committed support of the nuclear power
industry reflects an ideological and political-economy mandate to
reduce global carbon emissions while /preserving/ centralized
ownership, control and income from power generation.

This article's title foreshadows its content:  Many complex words

Orwell's 'duckspeak' condenses language into short bursts of
stereotyped, reflexive utterances, meaningless outside the context
of simplistic, indoctrinated verities supplied by the State.  The

equal and opposite version of Duckspeak:  In overblown hyperbolic
prose, the author piles high level abstractions one atop the other
until any possible meaning disappears, in an apparent attempt to
impress and confuse the reader.  I had to re-read several
paragraphs in the article to unravel their structure and assign
possible meanings to them.  On the whole it looks to me like a
verbal Rorschach inkblot; devoid of content, but the reader might
see his or her own latent beliefs peeking out here and there to
create an illusion of deeper meaning.
The whole semantic content of the article does appear in two
sentences buried near the middle of the text:  "Fort Russ provides
cutting-edge reports and analyses which lay bare realities which
mainstream Western media actively distorts, obscures, or flat out
conceals. This is absolutely crucial."  Here the author lays bare
his own apparent intentions and method, attributing them to The

Crazy?  More like far out.
Universal surveillance enables abuses of State power only when
access to collected data is restricted to State sanctioned actors.
 When everything becomes searchable by anybody, the inability of
State sanctioned actors to conceal their activities or effectively
lie about their history and motives will inhibit their potential
for destructive action.  "Power over others" depends in large part
on secrecy, while "powers of self determination" depend largely on
free and open access to information.
In the long run, the secrecy problem will take care of itself,
because the abuses of power it enables have already killed the

wired for self destruction, defending that program by any means
necessary, is "already dead."

Hash: SHA1
An independent audit found a substantial deficiency in one of the
dependencies of the SecureDrop document submission / management
protocol.  SecureDrop gave the devs time to fix it before
publishing, but so far the issue remains unresolved:
Publishing the unredacted SecureDrop 0.3.4 audit report
vs. SecureDrop uses OSSEC, a popular open source host-based intrusion
detection system (HIDS). The OSSEC architecture consists of a
single central server, called the Manager, which monitors one or
more systems. The monitored systems have programs called Agents,
which collect a variety of information and forward it to the
Manager for analysis and correlation.
The Manager and the Agents may communicate with one of two
protocols: "syslog" or "secure". The "secure" protocol is a custom
crypto protocol based on shared secret keys that are set up during
OSSEC deployment. NCC Group reviewed the custom protocol and found
two serious issues in its cryptographic design:
    Protocol messages are encrypted with the shared secret key
using Blowfish in CBC mode. Unfortunately, the protocol uses a
static initialization vector (IV) to encrypt and decrypt all
messages. This essentially reduces CBC mode to ECB mode and fails
to achieve semantic security.
    Protocol messages are not authenticated. Each message includes
an MD5 hash of the plaintext payload with the encrypted content,
but this is not a strong authenticator. Among other things, it
violates Moxie Marlinspike's "Cryptographic Doom Principle".
For more detail, see the finding in the unredacted audit report.
NCC Group did not take the time to investigate a proof of concept
(PoC) attack based on this vulnerability, but that is not
surprising given the limited duration of their engagement and the
fact that their focus was on SecureDrop, not OSSEC. Nonetheless,
these are serious cryptographic design flaws that could lead to a
practical attack in the future. We encourage all OSSEC users to
examine their current deployments, consider the level of exposure
of any OSSEC "secure" protocol traffic to potential adversaries,
and make changes accordingly.

Yes! magazine, the principal propaganda organ for Progressive Liberal
positive thinkers, seems to have just changed its editorial policy.
In a feature article widely distributed via social media, they have
published a detailed account of police violence at Standing Rock that
calls torture of prisoners torture, straight up, without euphemisms or
waffling.  This is a radical break from their customary "if you can't
say something nice don't say anything at all" policy, which is what
the Yes! brand has been about for many years.
Yes! will not meet standards for approval by our more wannabe-radical
participants here, because it is /most/ unlikely that they will ever
advocate killing people as the one and only practical way to affect
political change.  But they do reach an audience of opinion leaders
among the Middle Class Liberals, and those folks' favorite feelgood
story teller just took a shot at slapping them awake.  In and of
itself this means little, but as an indicator of shifting political
winds it is part of a trend that could become YUGE.
Our urban Middle Class has been treated to months of full saturation
propaganda campaigns presenting a vulgar buffoon of a
pretend-candidate for President as an existential threat to Everything
That Is Good And Holy In The Entire Universe.  The same campaigns
promote the absolute, unquestionable necessity of electing a ruthless,
vicious, high performing mass murderer who will save them from the Big
Bad Trump, depicting her as the shining champion and savior of
Everything That Is Good And Holy In The Entire Universe.  In recent
weeks I have seen people I would never have believed capable of
rational criticism of their Party's heroic leaders bailing out of that
mind set.
Is it possible that the cognitive dissonance barriers that keep
Identity Politics on the (so-called) Left working have started to
crack?  Could it be that the people at Yes! think so, and have decided
to roll with that and see where it leads?

Meh.  I prefer Trump by a /small/ margin; better chaos and gridlock in
DC than a massive, well coordinated murder machine IMO.  I'm
sentimental:  I hate to see millions of people slaughtered so a
handful of billionaires can keep growing their wealth & power right up
to the collapse of our present civilization.  In the case of Trump vs.
Clinton, better to roll the dice than accept a status quo that assures
the highest obtainable body count.
But I don't see a Yuge victory for the humans here, only a new set of
problems that /may/ be more tractable than those presented by Clinton.
I was rather shocked by the election results, because I have kept an
eye on developments in election rigging over the years.  Given the
aggregate power of entrenched interests sponsoring Clinton and the
scale of the cash flows that Trump's election have placed in jeopardy,
I did not expect a Trump win to be permitted.  Maybe someday we will
find out what happened behind the scenes - and whether the FBI
director's strange behavior had anything to do with it.

Right you are:  Everyone from Mao Tse Tung to the authors of current
U.S. Army counter-insurgency manuals agrees, an armed uprising needs a
succeed.  That network has to be built, and it has to offer its
participants "real hope" of a better way of running things, before a
shooting war can succeed.
Gene Sharp's description of the American Revolution provides an
excellent example:  In brief, Sharp contends that the war was largely
a matter of the Crown attempting to take its colonies back over from
their residents, who had negated most Crown authority through large
scale non-cooperation and the development of parallel institutions
rendering the Crown's administration obsolete.
So-called revolutions that start with gunfire, end in Fascist police
states - because they are not revolutions so much as coups that kick
out the old bastards to make way for new, worse bastards.  When they
"succeed" that's normally due to backing by hostile foreign powers.

As with most elegant solutions to real world problems, the sticking
point with AP is implementation.  It requires anonymous payment
protocols that are themselves "bullet proof", and would have to
weather counter-attacks by a ruling class whose financial resources
and ability to affect major infrastructure changes are astronomically
higher than common sense would suggest.  Bounties for killing the
operators of an AP system, offered through more old fashioned means,
would be extraordinarily high - requiring bullet proof anonymity in

Individuals can be honest, in a context where a mutual trust
relationship based on common material interests enables them to be
honest.  The weaker this bond of trust motivated by practical self
interest is, the less honesty is rewarded, and the more it is actively
punished when the information presented is unfavorable to the
interests of individual respondents.  Of course, there will be
exceptions to any rule:  Some idealists habitually tell the truth as
they see it with little regard for the consequences; some neurotics
will only tell the truth when they can't think of a better lie.
Organizations and institutions can not be honest, at least not for
long, because the persons who receive the most material compensation
through their participation in the organization or institution have a
personal interest in maintaining their dominant positions, inevitably
at the expense of other participants in the enterprise.  Growing the
power and influence of particular departments and the organization as
a whole, at the expense of other departments and organizations,
increases the personal compensation of members of those departments
and organizations.  So, both internal and external conflicts of
interest erode or negate trust relationships and the value of honesty
within and between formally organized enterprises.
Honesty's cousin, factual accuracy, is degraded or eliminated within
hierarchal organizations.  Hagbard's Law states that "communication is
only possible between equals."  When information is reported up a
chain of command, it is altered at every step by the reporters'
efforts to curry favor and/or avoid punishment.  A recent de facto
revolt by 50 intelligence analysts at CENTCOM, complaining that their
work product was being altered in transit to comply with the political
agendas, indicates that this mechanism is at work even in
organizations whose sole function is "accurately reporting information."
Mechanisms for transparency, accountability to third parties, and
flattening chains of command can to some extent mitigate the inherent
problems degrading honesty and information in organizations, but the
same mechanisms these strategies seek to correct are also present in
the mitigation processes themselves:
* Transparency requires reporting, and reporting requirements always
prompt the reporters to twist or discard information as necessary to
advance their interests, curry favor and/or avoid punishment.
* Third party monitors have their own agendas and organizational
drivers; as a classic example, the Internal Affairs activities of
police departments normally work to shield corrupt officers and
activities from accountability, except when taking sides in factional
power struggles affecting the whole organization.
* Organizations with horizontal command structures develop informal
cliques working off the record when and as necessary to influence the
organization's decision making and operational processes for their own
advantage.  This is done "for the good of the organization" as defined
by its ability to reward them for their participation.
Pontius Pilate famously asked, "What is truth?"  That was not so much
a question as a ironic statement:  In the Imperial Governor's house,
truth is whatever he says, because he has said it.  This provides us
with a working definition of what it means to speak "with authority."
The New York Times and its organizational sponsors manufacture truth
by speaking with authority.  A long running propaganda meme calls the
NYT a "newspaper of record."  What they publish is true because they
have published it, on behalf of State and Corporate powers with the
authority to enforce their collective will by any means necessary to
assure their continued dominance.
When the Times formally commits to "report America to the world
honestly," that only reaffirms their mission of publishing effective
propaganda in the interest of the American ruling class and their
various State and Corporate administrative organizations.  Some
conflicts among the ruling class will be reflected in that reporting,
and some factual information will make it through the many layers of
filters.  "Flat fact" will occasionally be published as loss-leader
material to maintain an illusion of impartiality, and some accurate
information will be exposed because the same mechanisms that degrade
competency within any organization degrade the quality of the NYT's
propaganda efforts.
But as a source of politically relevant general information, the New
York Times can best be approached as a hostile witness, if not a
downright vicious one:  If you want to know what your rulers want you
to believe in and care about, subscribe the New York Times.

When the DNC deliberately sabotaged the Sanders campaign, using every
means necessary to assure Clinton's nomination, the Democratic Party
lost the Presidential election.  It's as simple as that.
The Democratic party just proved itself worse than worthless and less
than useless, except of course in the eyes of Progressive Liberals who
expect to gain personal financial advantages from NeoLiberal national
policy.  Even with Sanders, they could have kept and expanded their
personal sense of categorical superiority to anyone who is so
ignorant, bigoted, etc. as to disagree with them.
Show a Progressive Liberal a button labeled "Kill a random foreign
family to help assure your own children's future financial security,"
and not one of them would push it. But label that button "Obama and
Clinton's Foreign Policy Agenda," and they will pound that button
until their fingers bleed - but not as much as the children of those
same foreign families bleed.  They are still bleeding right now.
Democratic Party loyalists who take great pride in being more
intelligent, responsible, and better informed than "all others" don't
get a pass on the basis of ignorance.  If there is /any/ basis for
their posture of inherent superiority, the only explanation for their
behavior is that they are ruthless, vicious persons who heartily
endorse mass murder for profit, while quite deliberately lying to
themselves and others about that - with the kindly assistance of
bullshit packaged and fed to them by propaganda contractors working
the Left Wing audience.
In a contest between a loose cannon with no track record in public
service, and a tried, proven, effective public servant with a track
record of mass murder /and/ significant evidence indicating that she
takes childish delight in murder, who does a "stupid" person vote for?
 Either, go toss a coin; stupid people vote for propaganda images.
Who does an intelligent, educated, upwardly mobile middle class
Liberal vote for?  The proven killer, every time.  And when they lose,

Taxes are payment for services rendered.  In the United States, 500
billionaires presently own about 1/2 of the capital assets; to retain
control of those assets they need a legal system that defines their
rights of ownership and enforces them, civil Courts to arbitrate their
internal disputes and legitimize abuses of power against outsiders,
civil infrastructure built and maintained at public expense to support
the productivity of their capital assets, and a propaganda regimen to
persuade the rest of us that this is all for the best.  The sovereign
State is /their/ collectivist system, taxing the poor to subsidize the
rich with all of the above services.  Taxes even support cash payments
and no-interest loans to the very rich, where and as bailing out one
corporation benefits enough of the others to create a consensus to do
that - at public expense.
I was wondering when someone would mention this.  Rich people pay a
very small fraction of the taxes they whine about and want to see
abolished; instead they pay accountants and attorneys to advise them
on how to avoid taxation.  Some few billionaires do pay enough taxes
that the numbers look impressive to illiterate peasants, for
propaganda purposes.  I recall there was a bit of a flap in the press
at the turn of the century when some ungrateful assholes publicized
the fact that Microsoft Inc. paid no corporate income tax; I believe
this was "fixed" by arranging for token payments thereafter.
Currency inflation is also a tax on the poor for the benefit of the
rich.  The lower classes store much of their wealth in the form of
dollars that diminish in value, while the ruling class stores its
wealth in instruments denoting ownership of physical assets whose
value is not affected by currency inflation.  Inflation also depresses
wages, as the same "dollar amount" progressively buys less and less.
The U.S. minimum wage from 1968, adjusted for inflation, would be
$24.00/hr today.
Political activists are presently running a "Fight For Fifteen"
campaign in the U.S., asking for a de facto 40% pay cut relative to
1968's more or less "living" minimum wage.  How fucked up is that?
Affluence requires collectivism, in the form of social and economic
class loyalty; join the united front in support of employment and wage
discrimination or you are out in the cold.  Getting a "really good
job" is a pay to play proposition.
It is possible for independent entrepreneurs to "work around" class
barriers; wildcat free enterprise works, for the tiny minority whose
bright ideas and hard work do pay off.  But when capitalist
enterprises notice something chewing on the edge of their markets they
crush it, as a matter of routine business practice.  Counter examples
can be found, but you will need a magnifying glass and tweezers.
Libertarian and other alt-Right propaganda teaches us that Capitalism
and Free Enterprise are the same thing, but in the real world they are
natural enemies and when they collide, Capitalism always wins.
Work will make you free?  Sure it will.  The spreading red stain on
the U.S. political map happens to exactly match maps showing the
geographic distribution of poverty, which brings with it both
ignorance and anger - a fertile field for Fascist indoctrination.  The
less intelligent in that audience self-select KKK flavored messaging,
the more intelligent gravitate toward Libertarian bullshit.  Both
flavors of alt-Right propaganda assert that their audiences are
inherently superior to other people, that that if certain scapegoats
were neutralized that audience would "regain all they have lost, and
more."  Just by coincidence, the ruling class - our billionaires - are
never named as scapegoats, but instead are portrayed as fellow victims
of an imaginary conspiracy of the weak and inferior.
Changing out "Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Fuhrer" for Ein Volk, Ein
Reich, Ayn Rand does not convert Fascism to Freedom, unless the
freedom in question is that of the very rich to do whatever they want,
restrained only by other factions within their same class, at everyone
else's expense.  In that case, a little rebranding to make Fascism
more palatable to a U.S. market might be all it takes to get 360+
million peasants "off the backs" of those 500 billionaires who own 1/2
the capital assets in the U.S.
By definition, organization and united action is political power.  If
you want the U.S. ruling class and its government off YOUR back, the
fact that your fellow peasants outnumber your aristocratic overlords
by more than a half million to one is the key to success:  Your rulers
have effectively unlimited financial assets and control of the State
on their side, you have - or  might be able to get - the power of
massive numbers of boots on the ground on your side.  Collectivism is
the key to power:  The very rich do it, cooperating to assure that
nothing threatens their established collective power.  Our rulers'
propaganda contractors have been busy for generations teaching the
rest of us that Collectivism is the Ultimate Evil; they are paid to
pump out this message because collectivism is the only thing that can
challenge the power of a well entrenched ruling class.
The cure for Libertarianism is Populism.  If you don't know what that
is, there are a few clues here, but be forewarned:  It requires
getting up off your ass and actually doing things, not just bitching
about how stupid those other people are.

Under the jurisdiction of State institutions created for the benefit
of the very rich, anything they agree among themselves to permit is
"perfectly legal."  That includes running a rigged house game
supported by massive deception and economic coercion, and assuring
that theirs are the only games in town.
Libertarian ideology relies heavily on false context.  When people
hear "personal property" the think "physical objects under my control,
and the fruits of my personal labors."  This context is not comparable
to possession and trading of legal instruments defining ownership over
geographically dispersed industries, vast tracts of land, anticipated
profits from as yet unexploited resources, etc., in locations occupied
and facilities operated by what the commies call "wage slaves."
In the U.S., most people's personal property is actually a collection
of legal instruments specifying the rent they pay on a finance
company's car, a mortage company's house, etc.  Low wages plus
expensive Real Estate creates forced dependency on land lords for the
majority of Americans.
How?  By litigating against offenders whose ability to pay attorneys,
expert witnesses, etc. exceeds one's own by five or more orders of
magnitude?  By lobbying for changes in the law, in competition with
these same offenders, their massive financial resources, and their
long standing alliances with dominant political and Deep State factions?
Ah so:  Taxation is payment for services rendered when that supports a
Libertarian argument, otherwise not.  :D
I blame full saturation propaganda operations paid for by the ruling
class who also happen to own the "mainstream media," working hand in
hand with State propaganda assets and of course, the organized efforts
of our DemoPublican Party which itself represents the interests of our
ruling class.  Political controversies in the mainstream occasionally
reflecting differences of opinion among dominant factions with regard
to whose commercial interests should be favored at the expense of
other commercial interests; but maintaining the integrity of ruling
class control and expanding same is a goal shared by the DemoPublican
Party as a whole, as is locking out participation by competing Parties.
Libertarian ideology relies heavily on cognitive bias and false
assumptions.  The argument presented above is persuasive - as long as
a "normative" distribution of assets and incomes is assumed.  But in
reality, a fraction of 1% of the population dominates in both income
and assets.  The models presented above does not have sufficient
resolution to accurately describe the subject matter addressed.
Check this high resolution model out:
Note also that "income tax" applies to personal income, not capital
gains.  Personal income as understood by John and Jane Q. Public is
only a small fraction of what members of our ruling class "make" in
the course of a successful year.
Libertarians see absolutely nothing wrong with the very rich "gaming
the system" for personal advantage in every way that having a lot of
money to spend makes possible.  This leaves everyone else on the
losing end of every deal that was supposed to be "fair and honest"
under rule of law.  Perhaps this explains why the Libertarian Party
was co-opted by well funded right wing extremists around the turn of
the century and has been working under their direction ever since.
What may have been a disruptive influence on national politics is now
only a propaganda platform, pushing political discourse to the Right
as far as it is able.  If you are too smart for the RNC, the
Libertarians have a better idea - and the same domestic economic
agenda, both functional and fictional.
I guess your definition of Libertarian embraces both NeoLiberal and
NeoConservative agendas and policies.  That makes sense, as the
synthesis of NeoLiberal and NeoConservative policy is Fascism - the
foundation of Libertarian economic ideology.
Europe and Japan became industrial powerhouses in the 1950s due to the
aging industrial infrastructure destroyed in WWII being replaced with
the latest and best facilities and equipment, with assistance from the
Marshall Plan.  Military and economic alliances including NATO and the
Trilateral Commission participants were firmed up at that time, as
were strong trans-national alliances among the ruling classes of the
nations involved.
The collapse of the manufacturing sector in the United States was
engineered by that alliance, by removing "protectionist" regulatory
and tax policies to permit dumping on U.S. markets.  The principal
objective was to break U.S. labor unions.  Exploitation of the
resulting political power vacuum to facilitate a hard "Right turn" in
U.S. domestic policy was also a major goal.  This program was
successful, and income inequality began growing exponentially as the
U.S. ruling class began looting the assets of the U.S. middle class, a
process that is still ongoing today.
The new manufacturing bases in Europe /created/ new middle class
income brackets in those nations.  Looting of the asset base this
post-WWII middle class started a couple of decades ago.  I hear it's
going really well, and Fascism is now on the rise in Europe.
The world has changed, not for the worse but for the worst:  The
enlightened stewardship of our economic ruling class, unchecked by any
meaningful feedback from those ruled over, has driven exponential
growth of toxic and resource-depleting industrialism worldwide.  We
are now well past the point of no return and a global economic and
population crash can not be avoided.  Our rulers are well aware of
this, and their response to date has not included any but token
efforts at mitigation, far more than counterbalanced by a mad dash to
make more money faster and concentrate it into fewer hands before the
game ends.  The rulers of today's world fully intend to rule the
post-collapse world unchallenged, and for all time.
If this means making the population crash happen sooner, massively
increasing the early body count and destroying the means for recovery
in presently habitable regions, so be it:  From a Libertarian
ideological stance, one might say that the world is their property and
they have a natural right to do with it as they please.  If you don't
like it, sue them.  In their Courts, before Judges who appointed by
their club.

It sounds like you believe critics of today's economic power structure
are opposed to anyone getting rich.  This belief is systematically
indoctrinated in Libertarian propaganda, borrowed from anti-Communist
propaganda from days gone by.  The meme in question is keyed to create
maximum animosity because after all, every Libertarian who's worth a
shit aspires to become "wealthy."  By some piss-ant peasant standard
of wealth, of course.  If you want to turn a few million  a year
providing a product or service to appreciative customers I'm all for

At risk of being repetitious:
Note the quantum discontinuity of the top half-percent or so, relative
to the human species as a whole.
Sorry, I wasn't talking about Government, I was talking about the
private sector, a.k.a. economic ruling class.  Deception and economic
coercion are their primary tools.  Courts and cops are necessary to
the survival of their enterprises, but may occasionally restrain some
of them from "irresponsible" abuses of power.
That's why total deregulation of everything and reduction of rule of
law to civil cases is a prime Libertarian platform plank:  The
government serves our rulers well, but under present conditions it
would serve them better if it was less protective of the health of the
workforce and more engaged in putting down civil uprisings caused by
those abuses of power.
The traditional Far Right shares the Libertarian deregulation agenda,
and is making slow but steady progress implementing it.  Libertarian
contributions to propaganda on this topic are more than welcome;
that's one of the reasons the Party exists.
Progress has been slow because a large faction within our ruling class
believes maintaining a stable, productive workforce, keeping up morale
in the managerial class, and preventing major civil uprisings is
better for business than a "reign of terror" approach.  Nonetheless,
the power players who like "stable" markets are aging out, a new
generation that thrives on chaos is rising, and the parable of the
boiling frog describes the present situation of "regular folks" who
just want to be left alone to tend their vinyards:  Jump out or die.
There's a significant trend among our Millinials toward jumping out,
and if they are not provided with a safety net by established economic
institutions they will do just that.  No such safety nets are visible
now, nor any signs that they are under construction.
When steam engine time comes, people railroad.  We are getting there
fast right now, with regard to wholesale rejection of ruling class
authority among the "best and brightest" of our young adults.  So you
old farts out there in radical-land better get busy, nobody was born

Nope.  Express and explicit.  Libertarian propagandists sell their
propositions with abstract arguments grounded in false assumptions
supported by cognitive biases.  This is consistent across their
messaging, and in the ideology of the True Believers.  It indicates
that the Party is dominated by propagandists with hidden or dual
agendas, not by idealists struggling to solve real problems in the
real world the old fashioned way, by working on them.
I won't bother to cut and paste my text that followed the sentence

presenting forced conclusions based on creating a manipulated context

Abstract absolutes:  Libertarians excel at using them to sell their

in the first place:  Simple, easy to understand, easy to remember and
repeat, the very STUFF of propaganda.  By contrast, real world cases
tends to make the propositions "proven" by ideological arguments fall
apart on inspection.

 Can a hunting party from the mainland "sell" Manhattan Island for
$24.00 worth of glass beads and junk jewelry - a fortune in trade

Three missing elements in this (very useful) summary:
First, the rise of the Third Reich happened while Germany was in
economic ruins due to the Great Depression and Treaty of Versailles,
literally on the brink of mass starvation.  The people were desperate
and the NSDAP offered a simple explanation (Jews and Communists did
it) and a simple solution (get rid of the Jews and Communists).  Under
these conditions the Nazis were able to organize a national militia,
the SA (Sturmabteilung a.k.a. Brown Shirts) and employ terrorist
tactics to help the German people vote correctly.
Second, Germany had a very strong culture of obedience to authority, a
moral imperative synonymous with "honor."  This mind set was dominant
throughout the European sphere of influence in the 19th century, and
although it was in decline (i.e. the much lamented decadence of the
"yellow nineties" and outbreaks of anarchism in the early 20th
century) it remained firmly in place there:  The older Germans I met
as a child were very much "Old World" people, and even as a child I
could see that clearly.
Third, Herr Hitler & Co. kept their key campaign promises:  They did
in fact restore Germany's economy and turned the country (back) into
an industrial powerhouse.  This was accomplished by implementing many
reforms borrowed from Roosevelt's New Deal, and with the kindly
assistance of capital provided by U.S. industrialists who heartily
approved of the Nazis' political philosophy and economic policies.
The Nazis earned the gratitude - and compliance - of the German people.
Hitler was a passionate nationalist; Trump is a vulgar opportunist.
Once in power, Hitler united his nation and did, in fact, make it
great again - at least in terms of economic prosperity and industrial
production.  Trump has already mobilized the already divided American
people into warring factions:  Our natural born Fascists are out of
the closet, the political Left is snarling and screeching while its
leadership digs in for four years of mortal combat, and "moderates" of
all stripes - a sleeping demographic giant - are looking for something
they can actually DO about this train wreck for the first time in
generations.  The Internet has broken the monopoly of Big Capital over
the content mass communications, so the Nazi's famous full spectrum
domestic propaganda regimen can not be duplicated here and now.
Although I would much rather have seen Sanders in the White House,
attempting to implement an updated New Deal solution to the ongoing
collapse of the U.S. economy, a Democratic Party under the literal
control of Clinton and her network stopped Sanders by every means
necessary, and handed the White House to Donald Trump.  So now we get
to see a radical solution to the various crises presently facing the
United States and the world:  Four years of open warfare between the
American Right Fringe and Everyone Else.
Our economic power brokers are already lining up behind Trump, leaving
"boots on the ground" in the form of mass popular movements as his
opponents' only viable response.  We have been taught all our lives
that this means armed conflict, because that's an option our rulers
are very well prepared to control and use to their own advantage.  But
economic warfare through strikes, occupations and mass non-cooperation
are powerful weapons that hit a ruling class hard where it counts - in
their balance sheets and quarterly reports.  Mass movements using
nonviolent strategies and tactics can move political mountains - or
failing this, the struggle to move those mountains builds the
committed support networks that must exist for a last resort armed
insurgency to succeed.

Although his fellow "upper class twits" called Roosevelt a Class Traitor

But his policies actually were "good for Business" and his performance
in dragging the U.S. into WWII do qualify him for the "fascist"
designation.  That label fits every President before or since, to a

But as an anarchist, I don't give half a shit what labels fit which
rulers; I do prefer economic policies that redistribute wealth -
therefore power - down the social hierarchy somewhat.  Others may view
the world in single digit binary terms, rejecting as worthless /any/ but

@_subject: Ark of Gabriel, Antarctica, [RUS], conspiracy 
Hash: SHA1
Maybe we can start with the "Ark Angel" part:  Did the original
authors of Biblical era texts understand the early modern English
meaning of the word "ark" and did they use that word to designate the
functional role of certain angels?
In early modern English, an "archagel" would be a senior angel in
command of an entire class of angels, including armies of angels
("angelic hosts") and vast angelic choirs whose primary mission was to
sing hymns of praise to the IHVH.
Calling Gabriel or any other angel an "Ark Angel" and spinning a
fanciful yarn based on that concept reflects naive assumptions borne
of childish ignorance, compounded by the authors' failure to take the
slightest interest in the sources of the mythology they are ripping
off.  So the "Ark Angel" narrative identifies itself on contact as
ignorant bullshit targeting and illiterate and/or mentally impaired
The truth, if you can handle it:  The Earth is hollow, inhabited by
abandoned robots left behind by its former owners, the "Abandondero"
or "Deros" for short.  The Deros were instrumental in the rise of the
Third Reich through their malevolent use of remote mind control
technology.  Nazi expeditions to Antarctica, prompted by the Deros
themselves, made contact with these malevolent creatures and an
alliance followed.  Since the war, a subsurface colony established by
the Nazis has been working with the Deros to build an industrial base
sufficient to conquer the surface.  Recent spikes in reported
"paranormal" and "unexplained" phenomena worldwide indicate deployment
and testing of advanced Dero technology at a scale never before seen,
indicating that this invasion is imminent.
So-called flying saucers were an early product of the Nazi/Dero
alliance, merging human and alien technologies.  According to numerous
declassified military UFO reports from around the world, the Deros'
expertise in manipulating projected energy gave them the ability to
selectively neutralize selected electronic systems in aircraft in
flight, and to shut down ICBM launch facilities on demand, by the
mid-1960s.  Today, their technology has advanced far beyond that early
stage, giving the Nazi/Dero alliance the power to take control of
"our" world more or less at will; the most significant unanswered
question is, what are they waiting for?
An executive summary of what is known about the Deros, and a survey of
the relevant literature, is available here:
X-Day is coming.  You will know the Omega Contingency Plan - Earth's
last hope - when you see it in action.  Will you take a stand, or
submit eagerly to Dero control?  Let whoever has an ear hear, whoever
has an eye see.  The rest of you, already begging for Dero control,
will dismiss the truth out of hand.  'Twas ever thus.

Hash: SHA1
Yes! magazine, the principal propaganda organ for Progressive Liberal
positive thinkers, seems to have just changed its editorial policy.
In a feature article widely distributed via social media, they have
published a detailed account of police violence at Standing Rock that
calls torture of prisoners torture, straight up, without euphemisms or
waffling.  This is a radical break from their customary "if you can't
say something nice don't say anything at all" policy, which is what
the Yes! brand has been about for many years.
Yes! will not meet standards for approval by our more wannabe-radical
participants here, because it is /most/ unlikely that they will ever
advocate killing people as the one and only practical way to affect
political change.  But they do reach an audience of opinion leaders
among the Middle Class Liberals, and those folks' favorite feelgood
story teller just took a shot at slapping them awake.  In and of
itself this means little, but as an indicator of shifting political
winds it is part of a trend that could become YUGE.
Our urban Middle Class has been treated to months of full saturation
propaganda campaigns presenting a vulgar buffoon of a
pretend-candidate for President as an existential threat to Everything
That Is Good And Holy In The Entire Universe.  The same campaigns
promote the absolute, unquestionable necessity of electing a ruthless,
vicious, high performing mass murderer who will save them from the Big
Bad Trump, depicting her as the shining champion and savior of
Everything That Is Good And Holy In The Entire Universe.  In recent
weeks I have seen people I would never have believed capable of
rational criticism of their Party's heroic leaders bailing out of that
mind set.
Is it possible that the cognitive dissonance barriers that keep
Identity Politics on the (so-called) Left working have started to
crack?  Could it be that the people at Yes! think so, and have decided
to roll with that and see where it leads?

I was rather shocked by the election results, because I have kept an

Right you are:  Everyone from Mao Tse Tung to the authors of current
U.S. Army counter-insurgency manuals agrees, an armed uprising needs a
succeed.  That network has to be built, and it has to offer its
participants "real hope" of a better way of running things, before a
shooting war can succeed.
Gene Sharp's description of the American Revolution provides an
excellent example:  In brief, Sharp contends that the war was largely
a matter of the Crown attempting to take its colonies back over from
their residents, who had negated most Crown authority through large
scale non-cooperation and the development of parallel institutions
rendering the Crown's administration obsolete.
So-called revolutions that start with gunfire, end in Fascist police
states - because they are not revolutions so much as coups that kick
out the old bastards to make way for new, worse bastards.  When they

As with most elegant solutions to real world problems, the sticking
point with AP is implementation.  It requires anonymous payment
protocols that are themselves "bullet proof", and would have to
weather counter-attacks by a ruling class whose financial resources
and ability to affect major infrastructure changes are astronomically
higher than common sense would suggest.  Bounties for killing the
operators of an AP system, offered through more old fashioned means,
would be extraordinarily high - requiring bullet proof anonymity in

surveillance capabilities.  The betting pool itself would alert
potential targets to take proportional defensive measures, which "at

Individuals can be honest, in a context where a mutual trust
relationship based on common material interests enables them to be
honest.  The weaker this bond of trust motivated by practical self
interest is, the less honesty is rewarded, and the more it is actively
punished when the information presented is unfavorable to the
interests of individual respondents.  Of course, there will be
exceptions to any rule:  Some idealists habitually tell the truth as
they see it with little regard for the consequences; some neurotics
will only tell the truth when they can't think of a better lie.
Organizations and institutions can not be honest, at least not for
long, because the persons who receive the most material compensation
through their participation in the organization or institution have a
personal interest in maintaining their dominant positions, inevitably
at the expense of other participants in the enterprise.  Growing the
power and influence of particular departments and the organization as
a whole, at the expense of other departments and organizations,
increases the personal compensation of members of those departments
and organizations.  So, both internal and external conflicts of
interest erode or negate trust relationships and the value of honesty
within and between formally organized enterprises.
Honesty's cousin, factual accuracy, is degraded or eliminated within
hierarchal organizations.  Hagbard's Law states that "communication is
only possible between equals."  When information is reported up a
chain of command, it is altered at every step by the reporters'
efforts to curry favor and/or avoid punishment.  A recent de facto
revolt by 50 intelligence analysts at CENTCOM, complaining that their
work product was being altered in transit to comply with the political
agendas, indicates that this mechanism is at work even in
organizations whose sole function is "accurately reporting information."
Mechanisms for transparency, accountability to third parties, and
flattening chains of command can to some extent mitigate the inherent
problems degrading honesty and information in organizations, but the
same mechanisms these strategies seek to correct are also present in
the mitigation processes themselves:
* Transparency requires reporting, and reporting requirements always
prompt the reporters to twist or discard information as necessary to
advance their interests, curry favor and/or avoid punishment.
* Third party monitors have their own agendas and organizational
drivers; as a classic example, the Internal Affairs activities of
police departments normally work to shield corrupt officers and
activities from accountability, except when taking sides in factional
power struggles affecting the whole organization.
* Organizations with horizontal command structures develop informal
cliques working off the record when and as necessary to influence the
organization's decision making and operational processes for their own
advantage.  This is done "for the good of the organization" as defined
by its ability to reward them for their participation.
Pontius Pilate famously asked, "What is truth?"  That was not so much
a question as a ironic statement:  In the Imperial Governor's house,
truth is whatever he says, because he has said it.  This provides us
with a working definition of what it means to speak "with authority."
The New York Times and its organizational sponsors manufacture truth
by speaking with authority.  A long running propaganda meme calls the
NYT a "newspaper of record."  What they publish is true because they
have published it, on behalf of State and Corporate powers with the
authority to enforce their collective will by any means necessary to
assure their continued dominance.
When the Times formally commits to "report America to the world
honestly," that only reaffirms their mission of publishing effective
propaganda in the interest of the American ruling class and their
various State and Corporate administrative organizations.  Some
conflicts among the ruling class will be reflected in that reporting,
and some factual information will make it through the many layers of
filters.  "Flat fact" will occasionally be published as loss-leader
material to maintain an illusion of impartiality, and some accurate
information will be exposed because the same mechanisms that degrade
competency within any organization degrade the quality of the NYT's
propaganda efforts.
But as a source of politically relevant general information, the New
York Times can best be approached as a hostile witness, if not a
downright vicious one:  If you want to know what your rulers want you
to believe in and care about, subscribe the New York Times.

When the DNC deliberately sabotaged the Sanders campaign, using every
means necessary to assure Clinton's nomination, the Democratic Party
lost the Presidential election.  It's as simple as that.
The Democratic party just proved itself worse than worthless and less
than useless, except of course in the eyes of Progressive Liberals who
expect to gain personal financial advantages from NeoLiberal national
policy.  Even with Sanders, they could have kept and expanded their
personal sense of categorical superiority to anyone who is so
ignorant, bigoted, etc. as to disagree with them.
Show a Progressive Liberal a button labeled "Kill a random foreign
family to help assure your own children's future financial security,"
and not one of them would push it. But label that button "Obama and
Clinton's Foreign Policy Agenda," and they will pound that button
until their fingers bleed - but not as much as the children of those
same foreign families bleed.  They are still bleeding right now.
Democratic Party loyalists who take great pride in being more
intelligent, responsible, and better informed than "all others" don't
get a pass on the basis of ignorance.  If there is /any/ basis for
their posture of inherent superiority, the only explanation for their
behavior is that they are ruthless, vicious persons who heartily
endorse mass murder for profit, while quite deliberately lying to
themselves and others about that - with the kindly assistance of
bullshit packaged and fed to them by propaganda contractors working

In a contest between a loose cannon with no track record in public
service, and a tried, proven, effective public servant with a track
record of mass murder /and/ significant evidence indicating that she
takes childish delight in murder, who does a "stupid" person vote for?
 Either, go toss a coin; stupid people vote for propaganda images.
Who does an intelligent, educated, upwardly mobile middle class
Liberal vote for?  The proven killer, every time.  And when they lose,

Taxes are payment for services rendered.  In the United States, 500
billionaires presently own about 1/2 of the capital assets; to retain
control of those assets they need a legal system that defines their
rights of ownership and enforces them, civil Courts to arbitrate their
internal disputes and legitimize abuses of power against outsiders,
civil infrastructure built and maintained at public expense to support
the productivity of their capital assets, and a propaganda regimen to
persuade the rest of us that this is all for the best.  The sovereign
State is /their/ collectivist system, taxing the poor to subsidize the
rich with all of the above services.  Taxes even support cash payments
and no-interest loans to the very rich, where and as bailing out one
corporation benefits enough of the others to create a consensus to do
that - at public expense.
I was wondering when someone would mention this.  Rich people pay a
very small fraction of the taxes they whine about and want to see
abolished; instead they pay accountants and attorneys to advise them
on how to avoid taxation.  Some few billionaires do pay enough taxes
that the numbers look impressive to illiterate peasants, for
propaganda purposes.  I recall there was a bit of a flap in the press
at the turn of the century when some ungrateful assholes publicized
the fact that Microsoft Inc. paid no corporate income tax; I believe
this was "fixed" by arranging for token payments thereafter.
Currency inflation is also a tax on the poor for the benefit of the
rich.  The lower classes store much of their wealth in the form of
dollars that diminish in value, while the ruling class stores its
wealth in instruments denoting ownership of physical assets whose
value is not affected by currency inflation.  Inflation also depresses
wages, as the same "dollar amount" progressively buys less and less.
The U.S. minimum wage from 1968, adjusted for inflation, would be
$24.00/hr today.
Political activists are presently running a "Fight For Fifteen"
campaign in the U.S., asking for a de facto 40% pay cut relative to
1968's more or less "living" minimum wage.  How fucked up is that?
Affluence requires collectivism, in the form of social and economic
class loyalty; join the united front in support of employment and wage
discrimination or you are out in the cold.  Getting a "really good
job" is a pay to play proposition.
It is possible for independent entrepreneurs to "work around" class
barriers; wildcat free enterprise works, for the tiny minority whose
bright ideas and hard work do pay off.  But when capitalist
enterprises notice something chewing on the edge of their markets they
crush it, as a matter of routine business practice.  Counter examples
can be found, but you will need a magnifying glass and tweezers.
Libertarian and other alt-Right propaganda teaches us that Capitalism
and Free Enterprise are the same thing, but in the real world they are
natural enemies and when they collide, Capitalism always wins.
Work will make you free?  Sure it will.  The spreading red stain on
the U.S. political map happens to exactly match maps showing the
geographic distribution of poverty, which brings with it both
ignorance and anger - a fertile field for Fascist indoctrination.  The
less intelligent in that audience self-select KKK flavored messaging,
the more intelligent gravitate toward Libertarian bullshit.  Both
flavors of alt-Right propaganda assert that their audiences are
inherently superior to other people, that that if certain scapegoats
were neutralized that audience would "regain all they have lost, and
more."  Just by coincidence, the ruling class - our billionaires - are
never named as scapegoats, but instead are portrayed as fellow victims
of an imaginary conspiracy of the weak and inferior.
Changing out "Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein Fuhrer" for Ein Volk, Ein
Reich, Ayn Rand does not convert Fascism to Freedom, unless the
freedom in question is that of the very rich to do whatever they want,
restrained only by other factions within their same class, at everyone
else's expense.  In that case, a little rebranding to make Fascism
more palatable to a U.S. market might be all it takes to get 360+
million peasants "off the backs" of those 500 billionaires who own 1/2
the capital assets in the U.S.
By definition, organization and united action is political power.  If
you want the U.S. ruling class and its government off YOUR back, the
fact that your fellow peasants outnumber your aristocratic overlords
by more than a half million to one is the key to success:  Your rulers
have effectively unlimited financial assets and control of the State
on their side, you have - or  might be able to get - the power of
massive numbers of boots on the ground on your side.  Collectivism is
the key to power:  The very rich do it, cooperating to assure that
nothing threatens their established collective power.  Our rulers'
propaganda contractors have been busy for generations teaching the
rest of us that Collectivism is the Ultimate Evil; they are paid to
pump out this message because collectivism is the only thing that can
challenge the power of a well entrenched ruling class.
The cure for Libertarianism is Populism.  If you don't know what that
is, there are a few clues here, but be forewarned:  It requires
getting up off your ass and actually doing things, not just bitching
about how stupid those other people are.

Under the jurisdiction of State institutions created for the benefit
of the very rich, anything they agree among themselves to permit is
"perfectly legal."  That includes running a rigged house game
supported by massive deception and economic coercion, and assuring
that theirs are the only games in town.
Libertarian ideology relies heavily on false context.  When people
hear "personal property" the think "physical objects under my control,
and the fruits of my personal labors."  This context is not comparable
to possession and trading of legal instruments defining ownership over
geographically dispersed industries, vast tracts of land, anticipated
profits from as yet unexploited resources, etc., in locations occupied
and facilities operated by what the commies call "wage slaves."
In the U.S., most people's personal property is actually a collection
of legal instruments specifying the rent they pay on a finance
company's car, a mortage company's house, etc.  Low wages plus
expensive Real Estate creates forced dependency on land lords for the
majority of Americans.
How?  By litigating against offenders whose ability to pay attorneys,
expert witnesses, etc. exceeds one's own by five or more orders of
magnitude?  By lobbying for changes in the law, in competition with
these same offenders, their massive financial resources, and their
long standing alliances with dominant political and Deep State factions?
Ah so:  Taxation is payment for services rendered when that supports a
Libertarian argument, otherwise not.  :D
I blame full saturation propaganda operations paid for by the ruling
class who also happen to own the "mainstream media," working hand in
hand with State propaganda assets and of course, the organized efforts
of our DemoPublican Party which itself represents the interests of our
ruling class.  Political controversies in the mainstream occasionally
reflecting differences of opinion among dominant factions with regard
to whose commercial interests should be favored at the expense of
other commercial interests; but maintaining the integrity of ruling
class control and expanding same is a goal shared by the DemoPublican
Party as a whole, as is locking out participation by competing Parties.
Libertarian ideology relies heavily on cognitive bias and false
assumptions.  The argument presented above is persuasive - as long as
a "normative" distribution of assets and incomes is assumed.  But in
reality, a fraction of 1% of the population dominates in both income
and assets.  The models presented above does not have sufficient
resolution to accurately describe the subject matter addressed.
Check this high resolution model out:
Note also that "income tax" applies to personal income, not capital
gains.  Personal income as understood by John and Jane Q. Public is
only a small fraction of what members of our ruling class "make" in
the course of a successful year.
Libertarians see absolutely nothing wrong with the very rich "gaming
the system" for personal advantage in every way that having a lot of
money to spend makes possible.  This leaves everyone else on the
losing end of every deal that was supposed to be "fair and honest"
under rule of law.  Perhaps this explains why the Libertarian Party
was co-opted by well funded right wing extremists around the turn of
the century and has been working under their direction ever since.
What may have been a disruptive influence on national politics is now
only a propaganda platform, pushing political discourse to the Right
as far as it is able.  If you are too smart for the RNC, the
Libertarians have a better idea - and the same domestic economic
agenda, both functional and fictional.
I guess your definition of Libertarian embraces both NeoLiberal and
NeoConservative agendas and policies.  That makes sense, as the
synthesis of NeoLiberal and NeoConservative policy is Fascism - the
foundation of Libertarian economic ideology.
Europe and Japan became industrial powerhouses in the 1950s due to the
aging industrial infrastructure destroyed in WWII being replaced with
the latest and best facilities and equipment, with assistance from the
Marshall Plan.  Military and economic alliances including NATO and the
Trilateral Commission participants were firmed up at that time, as
were strong trans-national alliances among the ruling classes of the
nations involved.
The collapse of the manufacturing sector in the United States was
engineered by that alliance, by removing "protectionist" regulatory
and tax policies to permit dumping on U.S. markets.  The principal
objective was to break U.S. labor unions.  Exploitation of the
resulting political power vacuum to facilitate a hard "Right turn" in
U.S. domestic policy was also a major goal.  This program was
successful, and income inequality began growing exponentially as the
U.S. ruling class began looting the assets of the U.S. middle class, a
process that is still ongoing today.
The new manufacturing bases in Europe /created/ new middle class
income brackets in those nations.  Looting of the asset base this
post-WWII middle class started a couple of decades ago.  I hear it's
going really well, and Fascism is now on the rise in Europe.
The world has changed, not for the worse but for the worst:  The
enlightened stewardship of our economic ruling class, unchecked by any
meaningful feedback from those ruled over, has driven exponential
growth of toxic and resource-depleting industrialism worldwide.  We
are now well past the point of no return and a global economic and
population crash can not be avoided.  Our rulers are well aware of
this, and their response to date has not included any but token
efforts at mitigation, far more than counterbalanced by a mad dash to
make more money faster and concentrate it into fewer hands before the
game ends.  The rulers of today's world fully intend to rule the
post-collapse world unchallenged, and for all time.
If this means making the population crash happen sooner, massively
increasing the early body count and destroying the means for recovery
in presently habitable regions, so be it:  From a Libertarian
ideological stance, one might say that the world is their property and
they have a natural right to do with it as they please.  If you don't
like it, sue them.  In their Courts, before Judges who appointed by
their club.

It sounds like you believe critics of today's economic power structure

indoctrinated in Libertarian propaganda, borrowed from anti-Communist

of them from "irresponsible" abuses of power.
That's why total deregulation of everything and reduction of rule of
law to civil cases is a prime Libertarian platform plank:  The
government serves our rulers well, but under present conditions it
would serve them better if it was less protective of the health of the
workforce and more engaged in putting down civil uprisings caused by
those abuses of power.
The traditional Far Right shares the Libertarian deregulation agenda,
and is making slow but steady progress implementing it.  Libertarian
contributions to propaganda on this topic are more than welcome;
that's one of the reasons the Party exists.
Progress has been slow because a large faction within our ruling class
believes maintaining a stable, productive workforce, keeping up morale
in the managerial class, and preventing major civil uprisings is
better for business than a "reign of terror" approach.  Nonetheless,
the power players who like "stable" markets are aging out, a new
generation that thrives on chaos is rising, and the parable of the
boiling frog describes the present situation of "regular folks" who
just want to be left alone to tend their vinyards:  Jump out or die.
There's a significant trend among our Millinials toward jumping out,
and if they are not provided with a safety net by established economic
institutions they will do just that.  No such safety nets are visible
now, nor any signs that they are under construction.
When steam engine time comes, people railroad.  We are getting there
fast right now, with regard to wholesale rejection of ruling class
authority among the "best and brightest" of our young adults.  So you
old farts out there in radical-land better get busy, nobody was born
knowing how to Smash The State™ with love in their hearts, a tear in
their eyes, martyrs to mourn and a new world to build.
Nope.  Express and explicit.  Libertarian propagandists sell their
propositions with abstract arguments grounded in false assumptions
supported by cognitive biases.  This is consistent across their
messaging, and in the ideology of the True Believers.  It indicates
that the Party is dominated by propagandists with hidden or dual
agendas, not by idealists struggling to solve real problems in the
real world the old fashioned way, by working on them.
I won't bother to cut and paste my text that followed the sentence
quoted above, it was an explicit deconstruction of propaganda
presenting forced conclusions based on creating a manipulated context
for evaluating statistical data.
Abstract absolutes:  Libertarians excel at using them to sell their
agendas, because that's the language that attracted and recruited them
in the first place:  Simple, easy to understand, easy to remember and
repeat, the very STUFF of propaganda.  By contrast, real world cases
tends to make the propositions "proven" by ideological arguments fall
apart on inspection.

 Can a hunting party from the mainland "sell" Manhattan Island for

corporate assets, is like asking someone who knows nothing about

Three missing elements in this (very useful) summary:
First, the rise of the Third Reich happened while Germany was in
economic ruins due to the Great Depression and Treaty of Versailles,
literally on the brink of mass starvation.  The people were desperate
and the NSDAP offered a simple explanation (Jews and Communists did
it) and a simple solution (get rid of the Jews and Communists).  Under
these conditions the Nazis were able to organize a national militia,
the SA (Sturmabteilung a.k.a. Brown Shirts) and employ terrorist
tactics to help the German people vote correctly.
Second, Germany had a very strong culture of obedience to authority, a
moral imperative synonymous with "honor."  This mind set was dominant
throughout the European sphere of influence in the 19th century, and
although it was in decline (i.e. the much lamented decadence of the
"yellow nineties" and outbreaks of anarchism in the early 20th
century) it remained firmly in place there:  The older Germans I met
as a child were very much "Old World" people, and even as a child I
could see that clearly.
Third, Herr Hitler & Co. kept their key campaign promises:  They did
in fact restore Germany's economy and turned the country (back) into
an industrial powerhouse.  This was accomplished by implementing many
reforms borrowed from Roosevelt's New Deal, and with the kindly
assistance of capital provided by U.S. industrialists who heartily
approved of the Nazis' political philosophy and economic policies.
The Nazis earned the gratitude - and compliance - of the German people.
Hitler was a passionate nationalist; Trump is a vulgar opportunist.
Once in power, Hitler united his nation and did, in fact, make it
great again - at least in terms of economic prosperity and industrial
production.  Trump has already mobilized the already divided American
people into warring factions:  Our natural born Fascists are out of
the closet, the political Left is snarling and screeching while its
leadership digs in for four years of mortal combat, and "moderates" of
all stripes - a sleeping demographic giant - are looking for something
they can actually DO about this train wreck for the first time in
generations.  The Internet has broken the monopoly of Big Capital over
the content mass communications, so the Nazi's famous full spectrum
domestic propaganda regimen can not be duplicated here and now.
Although I would much rather have seen Sanders in the White House,
attempting to implement an updated New Deal solution to the ongoing
collapse of the U.S. economy, a Democratic Party under the literal
control of Clinton and her network stopped Sanders by every means
necessary, and handed the White House to Donald Trump.  So now we get
to see a radical solution to the various crises presently facing the
United States and the world:  Four years of open warfare between the
American Right Fringe and Everyone Else.
Our economic power brokers are already lining up behind Trump, leaving
"boots on the ground" in the form of mass popular movements as his
opponents' only viable response.  We have been taught all our lives
that this means armed conflict, because that's an option our rulers
are very well prepared to control and use to their own advantage.  But
economic warfare through strikes, occupations and mass non-cooperation
are powerful weapons that hit a ruling class hard where it counts - in
their balance sheets and quarterly reports.  Mass movements using
nonviolent strategies and tactics can move political mountains - or
failing this, the struggle to move those mountains builds the
committed support networks that must exist for a last resort armed
insurgency to succeed.

Although his fellow "upper class twits" called Roosevelt a Class Traitor
and Bolshevik, and organized a coup against him (the "Business Plot").
But his policies actually were "good for Business" and his performance
in dragging the U.S. into WWII do qualify him for the "fascist"
designation.  That label fits every President before or since, to a
greater or lesser but usually greater extent, if I recall correctly.
But as an anarchist, I don't give half a shit what labels fit which
rulers; I do prefer economic policies that redistribute wealth -
therefore power - down the social hierarchy somewhat.  Others may view
the world in single digit binary terms, rejecting as worthless /any/ but
their own ideal solutions, perfectly and uniformly implemented.  That's
only a small part of the definition of Fascism, so I will refrain from
calling names on account of it.  Juan.

Hash: SHA1
Maybe we can start with the "Ark Angel" part:  Did the original
authors of Biblical era texts understand the early modern English
meaning of the word "ark" and did they use that word to designate the
functional role of certain angels?
In early modern English, an "archagel" would be a senior angel in
command of an entire class of angels, including armies of angels
("angelic hosts") and vast angelic choirs whose primary mission was to
sing hymns of praise to the IHVH.
Calling Gabriel or any other angel an "Ark Angel" and spinning a
fanciful yarn based on that concept reflects naive assumptions borne
of childish ignorance, compounded by the authors' failure to take the
slightest interest in the sources of the mythology they are ripping
off.  So the "Ark Angel" narrative identifies itself on contact as
ignorant bullshit targeting and illiterate and/or mentally impaired
The truth, if you can handle it:  The Earth is hollow, inhabited by
abandoned robots left behind by its former owners, the "Abandondero"
or "Deros" for short.  The Deros were instrumental in the rise of the
Third Reich through their malevolent use of remote mind control
technology.  Nazi expeditions to Antarctica, prompted by the Deros
themselves, made contact with these malevolent creatures and an
alliance followed.  Since the war, a subsurface colony established by
the Nazis has been working with the Deros to build an industrial base
sufficient to conquer the surface.  Recent spikes in reported
"paranormal" and "unexplained" phenomena worldwide indicate deployment
and testing of advanced Dero technology at a scale never before seen,
indicating that this invasion is imminent.
So-called flying saucers were an early product of the Nazi/Dero
alliance, merging human and alien technologies.  According to numerous
declassified military UFO reports from around the world, the Deros'
expertise in manipulating projected energy gave them the ability to
selectively neutralize selected electronic systems in aircraft in
flight, and to shut down ICBM launch facilities on demand, by the
mid-1960s.  Today, their technology has advanced far beyond that early
stage, giving the Nazi/Dero alliance the power to take control of
"our" world more or less at will; the most significant unanswered
question is, what are they waiting for?
An executive summary of what is known about the Deros, and a survey of
the relevant literature, is available here:
X-Day is coming.  You will know the Omega Contingency Plan - Earth's
last hope - when you see it in action.  Will you take a stand, or
submit eagerly to Dero control?  Let whoever has an ear hear, whoever
has an eye see.  The rest of you, already begging for Dero control,
will dismiss the truth out of hand.  'Twas ever thus.

But that's not stupid.  Just cautious.  Collusion between Clinton and

confirming it one should not "believe" it.  Most people can not avoid
conflating a speculative model that does fit the facts, with the facts

There is also a wild card factor:  It is reasonable to presume that
Clinton really is psychotic, Trump really is profoundly neurotic, and
that either would turn on the other under the right kind of pressure.
 This leads to all kinds of amusing speculation:  Is it even possible
that Trump could keep such a deal, vs. double crossing Clinton and
trying to win the election by any means necessary?  How much
temptation can a narcissistic personality resist?

Ain't no "if" about that collapse; "when" would be more accurate.  To
condense the behavior and design-mandated outcomes of industrial
civiliation into one sentence:  Unchecked exponential growth inside a
closed container does not end well.  That applies to the global
material economy, which has already exceeded hard limits and /will/
produce mass casualty events.
And the wonderful achievements of Progressive Liberalism only cost us:
 Ongoing wars of economic conquest, enforced poverty and de facto
slavery in the NeoColonies, refugee columns headed north from North
Africa and the Middle East, massive environmental degradation at home
and abroad, and upcoming mass casualty events on a scale never before
Here in the USA we have epidemics of non-communicable diseases (due to
"necessary economies" in industrial food production), a positively
for scapegoats and quick fixes, and a wider income and assets gap
between the ruling class and peasants than was present in feudal
societies.  And, oh joy, the U.S. domestic economy is being looted by
military interests while State Security forces are being rolled in to
"contain and control" a projected large scale popular uprising.
But our "homeless people" can have a shiny toy to compensate them for
their lack of basic security and so-called necessities.  Yes, they are
marginally better off than (for instance) the residents of cities
bombed out by U.S. proxy forces to protect and serve the U.S. National
Interest.  So that makes it all OK.  Nobody in Amerika is so bad off
that murdering some kids overseas can't make at least a tiny bit
better off; all boats rise on the tide of blood.
Slowly healing?  But not fast enough?  I wish I had the kind of income
and assets that make it possible to submerge oneself in that
delusional fantasy world.  Our Middle and Ruing classes voluntarily
participate in rationalizations supported by a propaganda regimen that
assures them things are getting better, and all the Bad Things that do
happen are absolutely someone else's fault.  That propaganda is paid
for, along with everything else supporting Middle and Ruling Class
lifestyles, by the ongoing war of global economic conquest that keeps
the engines of Western Civilization running at full throttle.  That
engine is fueled by the blood of innocents.
Today's "comfortable" lifestyles are capitalized by borrowing against
a future that will not happen, and every passing year of business as
usual makes the upcoming crash worse.  We are not in hock to human
creditors who can be bribed or bullied to forgive the debt; we are up
against cold equations imposed by the laws of physics.
Blame the victims, and anyone who disagrees with you about how fucking
wonderful Industrial Age civilization is.  That's the Party line.
Meanwhile, the "mature, responsible citizens" who parrot that
propaganda line do not WISH for their relatives to be raped and
killed:  They support the rape and murder of whole cities, which pays
for their comfortable, upwardly mobile lifestyle.  They also pointedly
ignore the fact that their own families WILL face that kind of
deprivation and violence as an unavoidable natural consequence of
living in a purely self-serving fantasy world.
The thing we call civilization now faces an existential crisis, but as
long as it serves their self interest our Middle and Ruling Classes
will welcome any opportunity to indulge in pathological denial.
Intelligence only means one has better tools to defend
rationalizations; education is a synonym for indoctrination; "success"
motivates reactionary Fascist conservatism regardless of any Liberal
or Progressive mask it may wear.

Submitted by Zak Rogoff on October 6, 2016 - 12:27pm
This week, the chief arbiter of Web standards, Tim Berners-Lee,
decided not to exercise his power to extend the development timeline
for the Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) Web technology standard. The
EME standardization effort, sponsored by streaming giants like Google
and Netflix, aims to make it cheaper and more efficient to impose
Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) systems on Web users. The
streaming companies' representatives within the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C) were unable to finish EME within the time allotted by
the W3C, and had asked Berners-Lee for an extension through next year.
Berners-Lee made his surprising decision on Tuesday, as explained in
an email announcement by W3C representative Philippe Le Hégaret.
Instead of granting a time extension — as he has already done once —
Berners-Lee delegated the decision to the W3C's general
decision-making body, the Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee
includes diverse entities from universities to companies to
nonprofits, and it is divided as to whether EME should be part of Web
standards. It is entirely possible that the Advisory Committee will
reject the time extension and terminate EME development, marking an
important victory for the free Web.

I'm not quite that stupid.
Only a sucker deliberately engages in "eyeball-to-eyeball combat on
equal terms" in real life.  There is no such thing as a fair fight,
because the only reason to fight is to shut a violent aggressor down.
 If it's a fight, fairness is already off the table.  Teaching people
to confuse fighting with a game or contest is a psychological weapon
used by ruthless, vicious "winners" to create weak minded, self
defeating losers and keep them in their place.  Bullies and losers
demand that people "fight fair."  I can't afford to care very much
about people who insist on proving themselves by "fighting fair."
In a real fight the only rule is to end it by the fastest, safest
means available.  Those who insist on proving themselves the better
man have a name, we call them cannon fodder.  Winners create and
exploit every possible advantage:  They lie, cheat, take every
advantage and the fewest risks possible while giving their adversaries
no chance at all.  Fighting is an ugly business, a grim necessity to
be avoided when possible.  There is nothing glamorous or heroic about
it and nothing to brag about afterward.
On the subject of "people working towards individual goals; each taking
a small chip out of the establishment," I understand that's a popular
idea.  I believe that "chip" is usually a paycheck.  But in politics
loners are by definition losers.  Popular fiction in the Rebel As You
Are Told genre would, of course, disagree with this assessment - did
someone mention media conspiracies earlier?
A plan to destroy the Leviathans of society the same way krill destroy
whales is no plan at all - because krill can't destroy whales, except
by dying off en masse and starving the whales.  Check your geophysics
- - that plan is already underway, literally /and/ figuratively,
courtesy of the Industrial Revolution.  The whole point of radical
politics is to change that plan as fast as possible.
Individual, uncoordinated acts of sabotage and non-cooperation can not
defeat a criminal gang that owns and controls a neighborhood.  It can
only weaken the gang, which results in a stronger, more predatory gang
moving in.  Kicking a gang to the curb takes an organized, united
front of uncompromising resistance:  In short, the regular folks in
that neighborhood need a gang of their own.
In today's domestic political warfare battle space, the effectiveness
of organizations opposing State and Corporate agendas are determined
by four factors:
Relevance - how much do how many people already WANT to obtain the
result the organization aims for?
Agility - how fast can you stand up an organization, and capitalize on
rapidly shifting opportunities?
Cohesion - resistance to division, sabotage and hijacking in the
organizational and network battle space.
Scalability - how fast can your organization propagate clones of
itself across existing communities?
When these four factors are present, Shit Happens.  They all require
voluntary cooperation, a.k.a. organization, and the relevant skill
sets and base of experience don't just happen by themselves.
Propagating the tools and experience necessary for political action is
a unifying theme and larger purpose of issue-oriented activism.  To
paraphrase George Carlin, "It's a big club and they want you in it."

If my assailant can reach my jaw, I can reach his eyes, trachea,
gonads, knees, shins and metatarsals.  Why should I let him hit me at
all, much less over and over, is a bit of a mystery...
In a real fight, the winners are those who walked away intact - and
ideally that includes the aggressor.  I have only been assaulted three
times; and three times, both myself and my assailant walked away
physically unharmed.  Just lucky I guess.
In a game there are agreed rules, and participation is voluntary.  In
an assault, there will be one or more assailants, and one or more
intended victims who did not agree to participate.  In a game, the
object is to win.  In a fight, the object is to stop the assault.
Game theory is a branch of mathematics that attempts to model natural
processes; it has numerous applications in combat, but combat is not a
game:  At any scale, combat is the process of an assault in progress.  "
I prefer terms like "systems dynamics" rather than "games" in this
context, because the word "games" has way too many loaded connotations.
In the political organizations I participate in, decisions are made by
consensus and specific tasks necessary to carry out those decisions
are delegated to volunteers.  A trusted facilitator has some influence
but no real power.
The 10/90 rule states that in voluntary organizations, 10% of the
participants do 90% of the work; it's a fairly accurate estimator.  If
enough of that 10% gets pissed off and walks out, the organization
falls over; that is the real power structure I have seen in the field,
and it is a reasonably healthy one.
If the neighborhood committee should happen to turn predatory, oh
well, at least the other locals will have a fresh historical example
of how to deal with the problem.
I can't remember an example of a flash mob that accomplished a
political political objective.  Flash mobs garnered some publicity
when the fad was still going on, but publicity is a tool, not an
objective.  All wishful thinking aside, knowing better does not make
things better - just "getting the word out" accomplishes nothing in
politics unless followed up immediately with organized action.  Maybe
that's why the "flash mob" thing came, saw, and left.
An organization is an instance of "organic" cooperation toward shared
goals, with coordinated division of functions among the participants.
 The definition as a system where dictates flow from leaders to
subordinates seems pathological to me.  Homey don't play that.
When an organization's power is established and maintained by violent
means that organization is already terminally corrupt.  It may grow
larger and more powerful, it may deploy more overt and larger scale
forms of violence, but it will not become more corrupt.
When an organization's power is established and maintained by mutual
aid in unified resistance to violence, that organization will be
inherently resistant to corruption, more so if it proves itself
competent by acquiring real power by using nonviolent force successfully
Humans are, collectively, a major pain in the ass.  If you insist that
any organization with humans in it must be foolproof, you must insist
that there BE no organizations - as apparently stated above.
But no organization means no power.  No power means no results, and no
push-back from violent institutions protecting their turf from
competitors.  And it seems to me that the potential push-back is what
keeps people glued to their sofas watching stage managed political
events on TV, rather than turning out to create political events of
their own in real life.

But that's not stupid.  Just cautious.  Collusion between Clinton and
Trump makes complete sense, but in the absence of evidence directly
confirming it one should not "believe" it.  Most people can not avoid
conflating a speculative model that does fit the facts, with the facts
themselves.  Intelligence services do all they can to train their
personnel out of that habit, with limited success.
There is also a wild card factor:  It is reasonable to presume that
Clinton really is psychotic, Trump really is profoundly neurotic, and
that either would turn on the other under the right kind of pressure.
 This leads to all kinds of amusing speculation:  Is it even possible
that Trump could keep such a deal, vs. double crossing Clinton and
trying to win the election by any means necessary?  How much
temptation can a narcissistic personality resist?

Ain't no "if" about that collapse; "when" would be more accurate.  To
condense the behavior and design-mandated outcomes of industrial
civiliation into one sentence:  Unchecked exponential growth inside a
closed container does not end well.  That applies to the global
material economy, which has already exceeded hard limits and /will/
produce mass casualty events.
And the wonderful achievements of Progressive Liberalism only cost us:
 Ongoing wars of economic conquest, enforced poverty and de facto
slavery in the NeoColonies, refugee columns headed north from North
Africa and the Middle East, massive environmental degradation at home
and abroad, and upcoming mass casualty events on a scale never before
Here in the USA we have epidemics of non-communicable diseases (due to
"necessary economies" in industrial food production), a positively
for scapegoats and quick fixes, and a wider income and assets gap
between the ruling class and peasants than was present in feudal
societies.  And, oh joy, the U.S. domestic economy is being looted by
military interests while State Security forces are being rolled in to
"contain and control" a projected large scale popular uprising.
But our "homeless people" can have a shiny toy to compensate them for
their lack of basic security and so-called necessities.  Yes, they are
marginally better off than (for instance) the residents of cities
bombed out by U.S. proxy forces to protect and serve the U.S. National
Interest.  So that makes it all OK.  Nobody in Amerika is so bad off
that murdering some kids overseas can't make at least a tiny bit
better off; all boats rise on the tide of blood.
Slowly healing?  But not fast enough?  I wish I had the kind of income
and assets that make it possible to submerge oneself in that
delusional fantasy world.  Our Middle and Ruing classes voluntarily
participate in rationalizations supported by a propaganda regimen that
assures them things are getting better, and all the Bad Things that do
happen are absolutely someone else's fault.  That propaganda is paid
for, along with everything else supporting Middle and Ruling Class
lifestyles, by the ongoing war of global economic conquest that keeps
the engines of Western Civilization running at full throttle.  That
engine is fueled by the blood of innocents.
Today's "comfortable" lifestyles are capitalized by borrowing against
a future that will not happen, and every passing year of business as
usual makes the upcoming crash worse.  We are not in hock to human
creditors who can be bribed or bullied to forgive the debt; we are up
against cold equations imposed by the laws of physics.
Blame the victims, and anyone who disagrees with you about how fucking
wonderful Industrial Age civilization is.  That's the Party line.
Meanwhile, the "mature, responsible citizens" who parrot that
propaganda line do not WISH for their relatives to be raped and
killed:  They support the rape and murder of whole cities, which pays
for their comfortable, upwardly mobile lifestyle.  They also pointedly
ignore the fact that their own families WILL face that kind of
deprivation and violence as an unavoidable natural consequence of
living in a purely self-serving fantasy world.
The thing we call civilization now faces an existential crisis, but as
long as it serves their self interest our Middle and Ruling Classes
will welcome any opportunity to indulge in pathological denial.
Intelligence only means one has better tools to defend
rationalizations; education is a synonym for indoctrination; "success"
motivates reactionary Fascist conservatism regardless of any Liberal
or Progressive mask it may wear.

Tim Berners-Lee just gave us an opening to stop DRM in Web standards
Submitted by Zak Rogoff on October 6, 2016 - 12:27pm
This week, the chief arbiter of Web standards, Tim Berners-Lee,
decided not to exercise his power to extend the development timeline
for the Encrypted Media Extensions (EME) Web technology standard. The
EME standardization effort, sponsored by streaming giants like Google
and Netflix, aims to make it cheaper and more efficient to impose
Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) systems on Web users. The
streaming companies' representatives within the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C) were unable to finish EME within the time allotted by
the W3C, and had asked Berners-Lee for an extension through next year.
Berners-Lee made his surprising decision on Tuesday, as explained in
an email announcement by W3C representative Philippe Le Hégaret.
Instead of granting a time extension — as he has already done once —
Berners-Lee delegated the decision to the W3C's general
decision-making body, the Advisory Committee. The Advisory Committee
includes diverse entities from universities to companies to
nonprofits, and it is divided as to whether EME should be part of Web
standards. It is entirely possible that the Advisory Committee will
reject the time extension and terminate EME development, marking an
important victory for the free Web.

I'm not quite that stupid.
Only a sucker deliberately engages in "eyeball-to-eyeball combat on
equal terms" in real life.  There is no such thing as a fair fight,
because the only reason to fight is to shut a violent aggressor down.
 If it's a fight, fairness is already off the table.  Teaching people
to confuse fighting with a game or contest is a psychological weapon
used by ruthless, vicious "winners" to create weak minded, self
defeating losers and keep them in their place.  Bullies and losers
demand that people "fight fair."  I can't afford to care very much
about people who insist on proving themselves by "fighting fair."
In a real fight the only rule is to end it by the fastest, safest
means available.  Those who insist on proving themselves the better
man have a name, we call them cannon fodder.  Winners create and
exploit every possible advantage:  They lie, cheat, take every
advantage and the fewest risks possible while giving their adversaries
no chance at all.  Fighting is an ugly business, a grim necessity to
be avoided when possible.  There is nothing glamorous or heroic about
it and nothing to brag about afterward.
On the subject of "people working towards individual goals; each taking
a small chip out of the establishment," I understand that's a popular
idea.  I believe that "chip" is usually a paycheck.  But in politics
loners are by definition losers.  Popular fiction in the Rebel As You
Are Told genre would, of course, disagree with this assessment - did
someone mention media conspiracies earlier?
A plan to destroy the Leviathans of society the same way krill destroy
whales is no plan at all - because krill can't destroy whales, except
by dying off en masse and starving the whales.  Check your geophysics
- - that plan is already underway, literally /and/ figuratively,
courtesy of the Industrial Revolution.  The whole point of radical
politics is to change that plan as fast as possible.
Individual, uncoordinated acts of sabotage and non-cooperation can not
defeat a criminal gang that owns and controls a neighborhood.  It can
only weaken the gang, which results in a stronger, more predatory gang
moving in.  Kicking a gang to the curb takes an organized, united
front of uncompromising resistance:  In short, the regular folks in
that neighborhood need a gang of their own.
In today's domestic political warfare battle space, the effectiveness
of organizations opposing State and Corporate agendas are determined
by four factors:
Relevance - how much do how many people already WANT to obtain the
result the organization aims for?
Agility - how fast can you stand up an organization, and capitalize on
rapidly shifting opportunities?
Cohesion - resistance to division, sabotage and hijacking in the
organizational and network battle space.
Scalability - how fast can your organization propagate clones of
itself across existing communities?
When these four factors are present, Shit Happens.  They all require
voluntary cooperation, a.k.a. organization, and the relevant skill
sets and base of experience don't just happen by themselves.
Propagating the tools and experience necessary for political action is
a unifying theme and larger purpose of issue-oriented activism.  To
paraphrase George Carlin, "It's a big club and they want you in it."

If my assailant can reach my jaw, I can reach his eyes, trachea,
gonads, knees, shins and metatarsals.  Why should I let him hit me at
all, much less over and over, is a bit of a mystery...
In a real fight, the winners are those who walked away intact - and
ideally that includes the aggressor.  I have only been assaulted three
times; and three times, both myself and my assailant walked away
physically unharmed.  Just lucky I guess.
In a game there are agreed rules, and participation is voluntary.  In
an assault, there will be one or more assailants, and one or more
intended victims who did not agree to participate.  In a game, the
object is to win.  In a fight, the object is to stop the assault.
Game theory is a branch of mathematics that attempts to model natural
processes; it has numerous applications in combat, but combat is not a
game:  At any scale, combat is the process of an assault in progress.  "
I prefer terms like "systems dynamics" rather than "games" in this
context, because the word "games" has way too many loaded connotations.
In the political organizations I participate in, decisions are made by
consensus and specific tasks necessary to carry out those decisions
are delegated to volunteers.  A trusted facilitator has some influence
but no real power.
The 10/90 rule states that in voluntary organizations, 10% of the
participants do 90% of the work; it's a fairly accurate estimator.  If
enough of that 10% gets pissed off and walks out, the organization
falls over; that is the real power structure I have seen in the field,
and it is a reasonably healthy one.
If the neighborhood committee should happen to turn predatory, oh
well, at least the other locals will have a fresh historical example
of how to deal with the problem.
I can't remember an example of a flash mob that accomplished a
political political objective.  Flash mobs garnered some publicity
when the fad was still going on, but publicity is a tool, not an
objective.  All wishful thinking aside, knowing better does not make
things better - just "getting the word out" accomplishes nothing in
politics unless followed up immediately with organized action.  Maybe
that's why the "flash mob" thing came, saw, and left.
An organization is an instance of "organic" cooperation toward shared
goals, with coordinated division of functions among the participants.
 The definition as a system where dictates flow from leaders to
subordinates seems pathological to me.  Homey don't play that.
When an organization's power is established and maintained by violent
means that organization is already terminally corrupt.  It may grow
larger and more powerful, it may deploy more overt and larger scale
forms of violence, but it will not become more corrupt.
When an organization's power is established and maintained by mutual
aid in unified resistance to violence, that organization will be
inherently resistant to corruption, more so if it proves itself
competent by acquiring real power by using nonviolent force successfully
Humans are, collectively, a major pain in the ass.  If you insist that
any organization with humans in it must be foolproof, you must insist
that there BE no organizations - as apparently stated above.
But no organization means no power.  No power means no results, and no
push-back from violent institutions protecting their turf from
competitors.  And it seems to me that the potential push-back is what
keeps people glued to their sofas watching stage managed political
events on TV, rather than turning out to create political events of
their own in real life.

That seems to equate nonviolent political warfare with martyrdom.
Along with "pacifism means passive-ism", that's a supporting script
for Rebel As You Are Told, a widespread, long running Statist
propaganda mission.  The message that "nonviolence equals helplessness
and can not work" is primarily intended to help prevent anti-war
movements, but is equally applicable to helping prevent successful
populist uprisings on any domestic front.  Per case histories,
successful revolutionary wars are won before the first (openly
acknowledged) shot is fired.  And even in "doomed" situations,
nonviolent political warfare methods can directly save lives, and keep
underground movements alive as well.
Some case histories:  Disregarded History by Gene Sharp, 14 pages.
Everybody from the Albert Einstein Institute to U.S. Army counter
insurgency training programs agrees:  To succeed, a home-grown armed
insurgent force needs a much larger base of committed non-combatant
supporters to succeed.  Without this base the insurgent force must
rely on support from wealthy patrons or foreign States, which moves
the context from "liberation" to "regime change," with a big quid pro
quo due and payable on the success of efforts to displace existing
State institutions.

suggest that a forum is sponsored and populated by teenage poseurs.

I'm inclined to agree.  Both relativity and quantum mechanics are
"counter intuitive" because they address events at scales and in
contexts  not encountered in everyday human sensory experience.  But
if we do not insist on understanding them through direct analogies
with familiar Newtonian mechanics - which simply don't fit - they
don't seem bizarre at all.
Robert Anton Wilson did a good job of cutting overblown beliefs about
these concepts down to size, here and there through his various works.
 He also did a bang-up job of explaining how and why subjective human
experience does not and can not very closely, or ever completely,
mirror "subjective reality" - if any such thing actually exists.

Proofs only exist in formal systems like maths and geometry, and then
only because those systems expressly define what constitutes a proof
within the given system.  In the real world, one may collect evidence
based on observation, analysis and experiment, leading to varying
degrees of confidence in various conclusions:  A massive weight of
evidence supports the first law of thermodynamics, but no one will
ever prove it "true."
In purely practical terms, demonstrating that one economic and social
system works better than another economic and social system depends on
two things:  The definition of "better" and observation of full scale
practical implementations.  The massive number of variables, feedbacks
and turbulence in economic and social systems rule out accurately
predicting outcomes based on thought experiments or simulations.
"Proof" invokes two value reasoning, which strongly appeals to human
cognitive and emotional biases but can not accurately model any but
the very simplest of systems in the material world.  Propagandists
love to exploit two value reasoning:  I have found that the presence
of the word "proof" in the title of a story circulated on the Internet
identifies a deceptive or delusion-based story with about two nines
Two value reasoning creates and strongly supports irrational,
delusional, and counter-productive belief systems - especially in the
sphere of political ideology.  Are you done thinking and ready to
impose your will on all the idiots and assholes who disagree with you

Not by me.  To grossly oversimplify:
1)  Quantum physics is spooky and inexplicable.
2)  Consciousness is spooky and inexplicable.
3)  Therefore, quantum physics explains consciousness.
Maybe.  But the missing link is evidence.  Or even a clearly
articulated model that can tell us where to look for evidence.
People who just "have to" explain everything in terms of concrete and
familiar concepts have been known to assert that consciousness does
not exist.  Maybe they are right in a limited set of cases:  The
Gnostics maintained that most humans are born without souls.  The
Taoists and Sufis posit that the soul is a latent potential that
remains dormant unless developed through self observation, and may be
extinguished by the weight of neurotic compulsive attachments to
"materialistic" motives and activities.  By "soul" I think they mean
consciousness exhibiting the ability to directly modify thought or
behavior, and/or perceive something other than the activity of the
nervous system, but that's a shot in the dark on my part.
Two questions at the opposite ends of scale sit there like bookends on
the library of human knowledge:  What is consciousness made of?  What
contains the Universe and enforces the laws of physics?
Again, those who simply "must know everything" assert that these are
meaningless questions and/or that there is "nothing there at all." The
scientific method addresses "how" but not "why" questions and to them,
if it's not science it's not real.
Those with a more experiential / subjective frame of reference often
arrive at the conclusion that consciousness and existence are
manifestation of the same thing.  Philosophers who tend toward
rigorous argument assert that by definition consciousness and
existence are the same thing for all practical purpose, and that this
tells us almost nothing except to define the limits on what /can/ be
known by human beings.
In Quantum Psychology, Wilson provides a guided tour of a lot of this
landscape and presents some practical tools, like the E-Prime variant
of English, for correcting some of the problems that arise from
believing that we know things we can not know, and behaving accordingly.
If he does, he will probably use a crystal ball, or dance until he
drops while tripping balls on the best available local psychedelic.
We have ways of getting at content that is "off limits" to normal
waking consciousness.  But he probably won't get the desired result
because in these matters, the process very notoriously has its own
agenda.  By way of analogy, one does not interrupt a paramedics
working at a disaster site with a request that she solve a crossword
puzzle.  You can try but she will ignore you or, if you continue
pestering her, kick your ass.

Information warfare in the public interest.

The great unwashed publick actually believes that "free speech" means
privately owned publishers have to let them say whatever they want, on
the given publishers' dime.  Isn't that cute?  Meanwhile, playing the
game of publishing arbitrary propaganda "for free" through social
media outlets is a whole 'nother thing.  Weasels ride for free, but
others may need to launch Big Stories (ahem) that would trigger the
Streisand Effect if they were taken down.  As illustrated in the
thread above.
Meanwhile, this seems to provide an excuse to get out my soap box.
The Facebook, as any good CPunk should know, is one of the twin crown
jewels of U.S. domestic mass surveillance, the other being Google.
The Facebook's national infrastructure was capitalized by DARPA's
financiers, and soon afterward propagandized with front page
placements in "student" newspapers throughout the U.S. (local sports
hero asserts The Facebook is life vs. death in campus social scene,
same template from coast to coast).  That worked brilliantly.  As soon
as its infrastructure was built out to accommodate really explosive
growth, The Facebook started accepting subscribers without .edu e-mail
accounts.  Given the identity of its de facto owners, this makes The
Facebook a classic study in large scale covert political warfare.
Then someone read The Facebook's terms of service and privacy policy,
and started talking.  In summary, by signing up one agreed to be
placed under ongoing surveillance through every vector available to
The Facebook; to allow The Facebook to integrate all intel collected
against the user and offer it for sale to all comers; and of course
granting The Facebook a non-exclusive but unlimited license to publish
any and everything submitted by the user, in a wrapper (c) The
Facebook, forever and ever amen.
The great unwashed publick was shocked - shocked, I tell ya! - and The
Facebook's terms and conditions were promptly amended to obfuscate the
surprisingly honest (insider sabotage?) original, and mitigate
whatever damage it did.  Meanwhile, under the radar, The Facebook
enabled NSA to outsource tons of collection and pre-processing for its
Rumsfeld-given Total (er, I mean, Terrorist) Information Awareness
program, /and/ made that service pay for itself.
Since then, widely publicized and briefly influential articles and
videos documenting the U.S. intelligence community's controlling
interest in The Facebook have gone down the memory hole.  So have the
early Facebook TOS docs:  I went digging for both a few days ago and
abracadabra, no trace of either turned up.  I am sure that a more
determined effort would find hot leads in old list archives & etc;
"Big Brother, Big Facebook," "Orwellian Social Network," and similar
strings might be productive.
I have an account on The Facebook.  I was a very late adopter; my only
initial interest was in testing promotional tools integrating websites
with The Facebook:  The "liek" buttons scattered like JS land mines
across millions of seemingly harmless websites; my own versions of
same that do not phone home to Zuckerberg unless deliberately
activated by the visitor; the uses and abuses of company Facebook
pages; and etc.  "The customer gets what the customer wants."
But eventually I decided to start using The Facebook to distribute
propaganda; it's not like this tells Big Brother anything about me
that's not already being collected.  Depending the propaganda you pump
out and the audience you cultivate, The Facebook can give productive
results - especially if you are interested in engaging IRL with
political activists, organizers and radicals.  The Other Side has
already spotted you; might as well let Our Team do so as well.
The Facebook is an environmental condition; a pervasive fungus on the
networks that is only as toxic to the user as the user's ignorance
enables it to be.
And that's all I have to say about that.

"(55 mins) "Her name is Alfreda Frances Bikowsky." While those six
words may seem innocuous, according to the Central Intelligence
Agency, if made publicly, they might have sent Ray and his journalist
colleagues to prison. On September 8, 2011, they received the first in
a series of phone calls and emails from CIA's media rep Preston
Golson. "We strongly believe it is a potential violation of federal
criminal law [the IIPA Intelligence Identities Protection Act] to
print the names of two reported undercover CIA officers whom you claim
have been involved in the hunt against al Qa'ida." They had used this
approach successfully several times in the past to persuade some of
America's most respected journalists -- Jane Mayer of The New Yorker,
Adam Goldman and Matt Apuzzo of the Associated Press, among others --
to withhold her name from the public. Seeking advice from the ACLU's
National Security Project, its lead attorney Ben Wizner made them
aware that she had become something of an open secret in his world.
They had stumbled onto a hornet's nest. Bikowsky, as it turned out,
was the person credited internally with the greatest PR coup of the
Obama White House, the successful assassination earlier that year of
Osama bin Laden. As chief of the Global Jihad Unit, she reportedly
runs the nation's drone strikes program. She is a through-line running
from the failure to prevent 9/11 to the push for war in Iraq to the
development of the CIA's renditions, black sites, and torture program
and continuing to today's targeted assassinations in countries around
the world. Through her story, we can see the details of a devolution
in the rule of law and the justice system in America, as well as the
impetus for and birth of what some call the "war on whistleblowers and
journalists." For 20 years, she has been at the center of history, yet
the covert nature of her job has prevented that history from ever
before being told to the public in one place. Doing so is necessary
for a democratic citizenry to have an informed discussion about
national security and intelligence policy in America's continuing
fight against terrorism. Speaker: Ray Nowosielski

century as a sterile debating society for pseudo-intellectuals.  But

driving factors:  Commercial marketing strategies creating
pseudo-tribal identities for consumers, to sell them must-have and
constantly changing gang identity and specialized status symbol
products; political propaganda in a "divide the conquered" strategy
that incites conflicts between these pseudo-tribes to keep them busy
fighting among themselves; and cut-throat competition within and
between these pseudo-tribes, as systematic looting by the very rich
gradually reduces all of them to poverty.  Add constant, pervasive
propaganda proving that things only money can buy define the worth of
a human being, that nonconformity is a disease, and that violence
solves problems (turn on a TV and stand back).  Viola:  Social chaos,

Oxford University Press, 1956
"Of the three types of circle that compose the power elite today, it is
the military that has benefited the most in its enhanced power, although
the corporate circles have also become more explicitly entrenched in the
more public decision-making circles. It is the professional politician
that has lost the most, so much that in examining the events and

corporate rich and the high warlord, in their coinciding interests, rule.

"The United States has, in short, moved beyond a mere imperial
presidency to a bifurcated system — a structure of double government —
in which even the President now exercises little substantive control
over the overall direction of U.S. national security policy. Whereas
Britain’s dual institutions evolved towards a concealed republic,
America’s have evolved in the opposite direction, toward greater
centralization, less accountability, and emergent autocracy."

Collusion between Legislators, Judges, Prosecutors and other attorneys

interpreted by semi-humans who chose "power over others" as their
career path and invested a lot of energy and money in gaining that power
A reasonable time to demonstrate the painful ignorance and delusional
beliefs our rulers have given us, to assure that we stay ruled.  Armed
insurrection, before the revolution process has even started, is a
gesture of suicide/surrender we have been taught to perform.  Think of
it as the ultimate act of obedience to established authority.
A revolution is won or lost before the first publicly acknowledged
shot is fired.  The shooting war is the last phase, its purpose to pry
the fingers of a stubborn ruling class off the levers of power /after/
their rule has already been rendered obsolete and irrelevant by
changes in the actual economic and social behavior of their subjects.
 Otherwise it's a coup, not a revolution.  A revolution is "the world
turned upside down."  A coup just changes out the old bastards for a
new set of bastards, usually worse ones.
The people in those Crown Colonies that became United States started
refusing to pay taxes and surcharges, ignoring the orders of Crown
authorities, and constructing their own systems of commerce and
governance long before that "shot heard 'round the world."  The
Revolutionary War was more a response to a campaign by the Crown to
take the Colonies back over, than a struggle to kick established
rulers out.  That is why the Revolutionary War had the necessary
organization and mass public support to succeed.
I found the bits of this essay addressing the Revolutionary War very
interesting, largely because I had not previously seen anything
similar in print anywhere:

In my view, Religion is about ideology and Politics is about power.
Since Greed is about power, a political revolution has little if
anything to do with ideology, except in that ideological propaganda
(emotionally charged fact-free bullshit) is always employed to
persuade people to support and participate in revolutions - or to
violently oppose them, as the propagandists' employers may direct.
Well duh.  Before the American Revolution, holders of Crown land
grants were the most wealthy and powerful people in the Colonies.
After the American Revolution, former holders of Crown land grants
were the most wealthy and powerful people in the States.  The U.S.
Constitution was written for the purpose of creating a Federal
authority capable of stomping down popular uprisings against abuses of
power by these same de facto rulers.
American racism was invented by the same fine folks, as a response to
slave uprisings earlier in Colonial history:  By granting White
"indentured" slaves special privileges, they successfully divided the
conquered.  That process has continued uninterrupted, with adaptations
to accommodate changing conditions, until the present day: In Obama's
Amerika, any black person with a Master's Degree or above is as good
as any white person - all others pay in blood.
Which is why we need more revolutions, beginning with establishing
alternative ways of life that reduce or eliminate the role of today's
rulers and the passionately held, completely false Truths they dictate
to our own communities.  Big job?  The biggest.  If not for the
pending collapse of the global material economy, I would call it an
impossible job - vs. one of the most important jobs anyone could be

Over the last few months the volume of posts has been way up, the

most of the longer threads.
That would be a Good Thing.  Lately I been thinking about the absence
of direct support & discussion of actual software projects here, vs.
in the old days.  I think two factors are involved:  The spin-off
cryptography list gets the technical discussion of cryptographic
matters.  And most applications that deploy cryptography in a userland
context are /huge/ productions these days, compared to (for instance)
PGP, Scramdisk, etc., and the teams working on them have their own
internal mailing lists, wikis, budget meetings, HR issues, etc.
These factors reduce relevance of the cypher- side of the present list
to real world coding projects, while the -punk side runs rampant.
Radical politics in the Libertarian vs. Anarchist range has been
on-topic since ever, as the context of end user network security in a
world of totalitarian regimes.
I do see some useful news & information relevant to network security
issues here from time to time.  Less reactionary bullshit and troll

The price of changing the world is that the world beats a path to your

awareness of the "issues" raised by the CPunk community is at an all
time high and still growing, as a product of the Snowden Saga and
growing overt Fascism in the former Western Democracies.  Anyone
looking for a "ground zero" of counter-surveillance,
counter-censorship, anonymous digital currencies and related
technologies is likely to land here.

Hash: SHA1
In the context of the Cold War, now arriving at the boiling point due
to the Bush/Obama Administration's belligerent posture toward Russia,
the U.S. annexation of Ukraine via a (literally) Nazi proxy force
makes strategic sense:  It was a destabilizing military and economic
provocation against the Russian Federation, and has been followed by a
massive conventional force buildup on Europe's eastern borders, adding
pressure to the weight of U.S. controlled strategic nuclear assets
that were /already/ present on that border.  These deployments must be
countered, which ties up Russian military assets and reduces that
country's force projection capabilities in North Africa and the Middle
Russia's continuing support of the ethnic Russian enclave on Ukraine's
eastern border also makes strategic sense:  It prevents full
consolidation of power by the U.S. installed government, prevents
routine deployment of East-facing U.S. controlled forces on the
Ukraine/Russian border, and provides a potential haven for Ukrainian
insurgents working against the government in Kiev.
Crimea's value to Russia is self explanatory, and I do not recall
hearing anything about the populace turning out to protest the orderly
handover of power to Russia in preference to a U.S. sponsored gang of
(literal) Nazis.  Rather the opposite, and I saw no evidence that the
U.S. even /tried/ to retain Crimea.
The "USA Number One!" mentality of comfortable Middle Class Amerikans
makes sense of a kind: Their continued material prosperity relative to
the former Working Class /does/ depend on global terrorism, enforced
poverty, mass murder, cities reduced to rubble and refugee columns,
etc. as the U.S. war of global economic conquest continues.  They
deserve to see the same things happen to their own children and
families, and if they continue to get their own way they WILL see that
- - unless they happen to be closer to ground zero "on the day."
Unfortunately, this cheerful little scenario involves dragging those
bodies down into the same hell.
The real conflict here is not West vs. East or even USA vs. The Rest
Of The World.  It is the human race, vs. its own parasitic ruling
class and their faithful servants.  The parasites have already lost;
if they do not surrender their power voluntarily (impossible),
environmental limits enforced by the laws of physics will destroy that
power (inevitable).  Now the only game in town is about reducing the
final body count, which no rational scenario places at less than a
couple of billion, and preserving essential long term survival
resources for the survivors.  And that's where radical populist
politics enters the scene.  Communication is vitally important in
political warfare, and providing the best possible tools to Our Side
is the mission that makes "cypherpunk" bullshit worth doing.

That seems to equate nonviolent political warfare with martyrdom.
Along with "pacifism means passive-ism", that's a supporting script
for Rebel As You Are Told, a widespread, long running Statist
propaganda mission.  The message that "nonviolence equals helplessness
and can not work" is primarily intended to help prevent anti-war
movements, but is equally applicable to helping prevent successful
populist uprisings on any domestic front.  Per case histories,
successful revolutionary wars are won before the first (openly
acknowledged) shot is fired.  And even in "doomed" situations,
nonviolent political warfare methods can directly save lives, and keep
underground movements alive as well.
Some case histories:  Disregarded History by Gene Sharp, 14 pages.
Everybody from the Albert Einstein Institute to U.S. Army counter
insurgency training programs agrees:  To succeed, a home-grown armed
insurgent force needs a much larger base of committed non-combatant
supporters to succeed.  Without this base the insurgent force must
rely on support from wealthy patrons or foreign States, which moves
the context from "liberation" to "regime change," with a big quid pro
quo due and payable on the success of efforts to displace existing
State institutions.
Right on.  Fuck Anarchism - as a label or worse, an identity.  But

I'm inclined to agree.  Both relativity and quantum mechanics are
"counter intuitive" because they address events at scales and in
contexts  not encountered in everyday human sensory experience.  But
if we do not insist on understanding them through direct analogies
with familiar Newtonian mechanics - which simply don't fit - they
don't seem bizarre at all.
Robert Anton Wilson did a good job of cutting overblown beliefs about
these concepts down to size, here and there through his various works.
 He also did a bang-up job of explaining how and why subjective human
experience does not and can not very closely, or ever completely,
mirror "subjective reality" - if any such thing actually exists.
A new Hilaritas Press print edition of RAW's Quantum Psychology just

will find PDF copies of earlier editions floating around here and

Proofs only exist in formal systems like maths and geometry, and then
only because those systems expressly define what constitutes a proof
within the given system.  In the real world, one may collect evidence
based on observation, analysis and experiment, leading to varying
degrees of confidence in various conclusions:  A massive weight of
evidence supports the first law of thermodynamics, but no one will
ever prove it "true."
In purely practical terms, demonstrating that one economic and social
system works better than another economic and social system depends on
two things:  The definition of "better" and observation of full scale
practical implementations.  The massive number of variables, feedbacks
and turbulence in economic and social systems rule out accurately
predicting outcomes based on thought experiments or simulations.
"Proof" invokes two value reasoning, which strongly appeals to human
cognitive and emotional biases but can not accurately model any but
the very simplest of systems in the material world.  Propagandists
love to exploit two value reasoning:  I have found that the presence
of the word "proof" in the title of a story circulated on the Internet
identifies a deceptive or delusion-based story with about two nines
Two value reasoning creates and strongly supports irrational,
delusional, and counter-productive belief systems - especially in the
sphere of political ideology.  Are you done thinking and ready to
impose your will on all the idiots and assholes who disagree with you
by force?  Then "proof" is your golden ticket to rationalizing

Not by me.  To grossly oversimplify:
1)  Quantum physics is spooky and inexplicable.
2)  Consciousness is spooky and inexplicable.
3)  Therefore, quantum physics explains consciousness.
Maybe.  But the missing link is evidence.  Or even a clearly
articulated model that can tell us where to look for evidence.
People who just "have to" explain everything in terms of concrete and
familiar concepts have been known to assert that consciousness does
not exist.  Maybe they are right in a limited set of cases:  The
Gnostics maintained that most humans are born without souls.  The
Taoists and Sufis posit that the soul is a latent potential that
remains dormant unless developed through self observation, and may be
extinguished by the weight of neurotic compulsive attachments to
"materialistic" motives and activities.  By "soul" I think they mean
consciousness exhibiting the ability to directly modify thought or
behavior, and/or perceive something other than the activity of the
nervous system, but that's a shot in the dark on my part.
Two questions at the opposite ends of scale sit there like bookends on
the library of human knowledge:  What is consciousness made of?  What
contains the Universe and enforces the laws of physics?
Again, those who simply "must know everything" assert that these are
meaningless questions and/or that there is "nothing there at all." The
scientific method addresses "how" but not "why" questions and to them,
if it's not science it's not real.
Those with a more experiential / subjective frame of reference often
arrive at the conclusion that consciousness and existence are
manifestation of the same thing.  Philosophers who tend toward
rigorous argument assert that by definition consciousness and
existence are the same thing for all practical purpose, and that this
tells us almost nothing except to define the limits on what /can/ be
known by human beings.
In Quantum Psychology, Wilson provides a guided tour of a lot of this
landscape and presents some practical tools, like the E-Prime variant
of English, for correcting some of the problems that arise from
believing that we know things we can not know, and behaving accordingly.
If he does, he will probably use a crystal ball, or dance until he
drops while tripping balls on the best available local psychedelic.
We have ways of getting at content that is "off limits" to normal
waking consciousness.  But he probably won't get the desired result
because in these matters, the process very notoriously has its own
agenda.  By way of analogy, one does not interrupt a paramedics
working at a disaster site with a request that she solve a crossword
puzzle.  You can try but she will ignore you or, if you continue
pestering her, kick your ass.

Information warfare in the public interest.

The great unwashed publick actually believes that "free speech" means
privately owned publishers have to let them say whatever they want, on
the given publishers' dime.  Isn't that cute?  Meanwhile, playing the
game of publishing arbitrary propaganda "for free" through social
media outlets is a whole 'nother thing.  Weasels ride for free, but
others may need to launch Big Stories (ahem) that would trigger the
Streisand Effect if they were taken down.  As illustrated in the
thread above.
Meanwhile, this seems to provide an excuse to get out my soap box.
The Facebook, as any good CPunk should know, is one of the twin crown
jewels of U.S. domestic mass surveillance, the other being Google.
The Facebook's national infrastructure was capitalized by DARPA's
financiers, and soon afterward propagandized with front page
placements in "student" newspapers throughout the U.S. (local sports
hero asserts The Facebook is life vs. death in campus social scene,
same template from coast to coast).  That worked brilliantly.  As soon
as its infrastructure was built out to accommodate really explosive
growth, The Facebook started accepting subscribers without .edu e-mail
accounts.  Given the identity of its de facto owners, this makes The
Facebook a classic study in large scale covert political warfare.
Then someone read The Facebook's terms of service and privacy policy,
and started talking.  In summary, by signing up one agreed to be
placed under ongoing surveillance through every vector available to
The Facebook; to allow The Facebook to integrate all intel collected
against the user and offer it for sale to all comers; and of course
granting The Facebook a non-exclusive but unlimited license to publish
any and everything submitted by the user, in a wrapper (c) The
Facebook, forever and ever amen.
The great unwashed publick was shocked - shocked, I tell ya! - and The
Facebook's terms and conditions were promptly amended to obfuscate the
surprisingly honest (insider sabotage?) original, and mitigate
whatever damage it did.  Meanwhile, under the radar, The Facebook
enabled NSA to outsource tons of collection and pre-processing for its
Rumsfeld-given Total (er, I mean, Terrorist) Information Awareness
program, /and/ made that service pay for itself.
Since then, widely publicized and briefly influential articles and
videos documenting the U.S. intelligence community's controlling
interest in The Facebook have gone down the memory hole.  So have the
early Facebook TOS docs:  I went digging for both a few days ago and
abracadabra, no trace of either turned up.  I am sure that a more
determined effort would find hot leads in old list archives & etc;
"Big Brother, Big Facebook," "Orwellian Social Network," and similar
strings might be productive.
I have an account on The Facebook.  I was a very late adopter; my only
initial interest was in testing promotional tools integrating websites
with The Facebook:  The "liek" buttons scattered like JS land mines
across millions of seemingly harmless websites; my own versions of
same that do not phone home to Zuckerberg unless deliberately
activated by the visitor; the uses and abuses of company Facebook
pages; and etc.  "The customer gets what the customer wants."
But eventually I decided to start using The Facebook to distribute
propaganda; it's not like this tells Big Brother anything about me
that's not already being collected.  Depending the propaganda you pump
out and the audience you cultivate, The Facebook can give productive
results - especially if you are interested in engaging IRL with
political activists, organizers and radicals.  The Other Side has
already spotted you; might as well let Our Team do so as well.
The Facebook is an environmental condition; a pervasive fungus on the
networks that is only as toxic to the user as the user's ignorance
enables it to be.
And that's all I have to say about that.

"(55 mins) "Her name is Alfreda Frances Bikowsky." While those six
words may seem innocuous, according to the Central Intelligence
Agency, if made publicly, they might have sent Ray and his journalist
colleagues to prison. On September 8, 2011, they received the first in
a series of phone calls and emails from CIA's media rep Preston
Golson. "We strongly believe it is a potential violation of federal
criminal law [the IIPA Intelligence Identities Protection Act] to
print the names of two reported undercover CIA officers whom you claim
have been involved in the hunt against al Qa'ida." They had used this
approach successfully several times in the past to persuade some of
America's most respected journalists -- Jane Mayer of The New Yorker,
Adam Goldman and Matt Apuzzo of the Associated Press, among others --
to withhold her name from the public. Seeking advice from the ACLU's
National Security Project, its lead attorney Ben Wizner made them
aware that she had become something of an open secret in his world.
They had stumbled onto a hornet's nest. Bikowsky, as it turned out,
was the person credited internally with the greatest PR coup of the
Obama White House, the successful assassination earlier that year of
Osama bin Laden. As chief of the Global Jihad Unit, she reportedly
runs the nation's drone strikes program. She is a through-line running
from the failure to prevent 9/11 to the push for war in Iraq to the
development of the CIA's renditions, black sites, and torture program
and continuing to today's targeted assassinations in countries around
the world. Through her story, we can see the details of a devolution
in the rule of law and the justice system in America, as well as the
impetus for and birth of what some call the "war on whistleblowers and
journalists." For 20 years, she has been at the center of history, yet
the covert nature of her job has prevented that history from ever
before being told to the public in one place. Doing so is necessary
for a democratic citizenry to have an informed discussion about
national security and intelligence policy in America's continuing
fight against terrorism. Speaker: Ray Nowosielski

century as a sterile debating society for pseudo-intellectuals.  But
then I'm an anarchist:  I like general models applicable to a wide
range of dynamic systems; don't like rigid, dogmatic, prescriptive
I interpret "social chaos in Western society" as a result of several
driving factors:  Commercial marketing strategies creating
pseudo-tribal identities for consumers, to sell them must-have and
constantly changing gang identity and specialized status symbol
products; political propaganda in a "divide the conquered" strategy
that incites conflicts between these pseudo-tribes to keep them busy
fighting among themselves; and cut-throat competition within and
between these pseudo-tribes, as systematic looting by the very rich
gradually reduces all of them to poverty.  Add constant, pervasive
propaganda proving that things only money can buy define the worth of
a human being, that nonconformity is a disease, and that violence
solves problems (turn on a TV and stand back).  Viola:  Social chaos,

"Of the three types of circle that compose the power elite today, it is
the military that has benefited the most in its enhanced power, although
the corporate circles have also become more explicitly entrenched in the
more public decision-making circles. It is the professional politician
that has lost the most, so much that in examining the events and

"The United States has, in short, moved beyond a mere imperial
presidency to a bifurcated system — a structure of double government —
in which even the President now exercises little substantive control
over the overall direction of U.S. national security policy. Whereas
Britain’s dual institutions evolved towards a concealed republic,
America’s have evolved in the opposite direction, toward greater
centralization, less accountability, and emergent autocracy."

There's a lot to be said for signing messages to lists like this.  It
makes impersonation way more difficult.  It provides a visual reminder
that "signing exists" and thus promotes the use of basic crypto tools.
 Also, if list archives contain /many/ specimens of your signature,
that enables people to have /some/ limited confidence that it "really
is your key" in the absence of direct personal contact or a trusted
On the downside, it makes denying that you wrote something all but
impossible - "somebody stole my signing key and its pass phrase" is
not what someone who is trying to avoid embarrassment would like to say.
And the signatures annoy many people whose mail readers are not set up
to interpret them - possibly the best reason of all.

substantial length of time will learn that time is not what we think
it is.  In my case, I was rather shocked to find descriptions of
several people I had not /yet/ met in real life, and how we would
interact some months later.
On another occasion, I found a detailed description of events - the
date confirmed as correct per the a note that the moon was full - that
one week later neither I nor anyone else involved remembered, in a
regular journal.  Mind = blown.
None of this can or should persuade anyone but me that something
damned strange is going on with this "reality" thing.  But I was and
remain so persuaded.  Now the question is, what does it mean and what
can I do with/to/about it?  So far the only answer I get is "just be

Collusion between Legislators, Judges, Prosecutors and other attorneys
make it so.  Software code is interpreted by machines without
conflicts of interest or hands out for bribes.  Legal code is
interpreted by semi-humans who chose "power over others" as their
career path and invested a lot of energy and money in gaining that power
A reasonable time to demonstrate the painful ignorance and delusional
beliefs our rulers have given us, to assure that we stay ruled.  Armed
insurrection, before the revolution process has even started, is a
gesture of suicide/surrender we have been taught to perform.  Think of
it as the ultimate act of obedience to established authority.
A revolution is won or lost before the first publicly acknowledged
shot is fired.  The shooting war is the last phase, its purpose to pry
the fingers of a stubborn ruling class off the levers of power /after/
their rule has already been rendered obsolete and irrelevant by
changes in the actual economic and social behavior of their subjects.
 Otherwise it's a coup, not a revolution.  A revolution is "the world
turned upside down."  A coup just changes out the old bastards for a
new set of bastards, usually worse ones.
The people in those Crown Colonies that became United States started
refusing to pay taxes and surcharges, ignoring the orders of Crown
authorities, and constructing their own systems of commerce and
governance long before that "shot heard 'round the world."  The
Revolutionary War was more a response to a campaign by the Crown to
take the Colonies back over, than a struggle to kick established
rulers out.  That is why the Revolutionary War had the necessary
organization and mass public support to succeed.
I found the bits of this essay addressing the Revolutionary War very
interesting, largely because I had not previously seen anything
similar in print anywhere:

In my view, Religion is about ideology and Politics is about power.
Since Greed is about power, a political revolution has little if
anything to do with ideology, except in that ideological propaganda
(emotionally charged fact-free bullshit) is always employed to
persuade people to support and participate in revolutions - or to
violently oppose them, as the propagandists' employers may direct.
Well duh.  Before the American Revolution, holders of Crown land
grants were the most wealthy and powerful people in the Colonies.
After the American Revolution, former holders of Crown land grants
were the most wealthy and powerful people in the States.  The U.S.
Constitution was written for the purpose of creating a Federal
authority capable of stomping down popular uprisings against abuses of
power by these same de facto rulers.
American racism was invented by the same fine folks, as a response to
slave uprisings earlier in Colonial history:  By granting White
"indentured" slaves special privileges, they successfully divided the
conquered.  That process has continued uninterrupted, with adaptations
to accommodate changing conditions, until the present day: In Obama's
Amerika, any black person with a Master's Degree or above is as good
as any white person - all others pay in blood.
Which is why we need more revolutions, beginning with establishing
alternative ways of life that reduce or eliminate the role of today's
rulers and the passionately held, completely false Truths they dictate
to our own communities.  Big job?  The biggest.  If not for the
pending collapse of the global material economy, I would call it an
impossible job - vs. one of the most important jobs anyone could be
working on today.

Over the last few months the volume of posts has been way up, the

most of the longer threads.
That would be a Good Thing.  Lately I been thinking about the absence
of direct support & discussion of actual software projects here, vs.
in the old days.  I think two factors are involved:  The spin-off
cryptography list gets the technical discussion of cryptographic
matters.  And most applications that deploy cryptography in a userland
context are /huge/ productions these days, compared to (for instance)
PGP, Scramdisk, etc., and the teams working on them have their own
internal mailing lists, wikis, budget meetings, HR issues, etc.
These factors reduce relevance of the cypher- side of the present list
to real world coding projects, while the -punk side runs rampant.
Radical politics in the Libertarian vs. Anarchist range has been
on-topic since ever, as the context of end user network security in a
world of totalitarian regimes.
I do see some useful news & information relevant to network security
issues here from time to time.  Less reactionary bullshit and troll

The price of changing the world is that the world beats a path to your
door.  So far this list has been spared the worst of that.  But public
awareness of the "issues" raised by the CPunk community is at an all
time high and still growing, as a product of the Snowden Saga and
growing overt Fascism in the former Western Democracies.  Anyone
looking for a "ground zero" of counter-surveillance,
counter-censorship, anonymous digital currencies and related
technologies is likely to land here.
This may sound snarky but I'm quite serious:  If people want to see

Hash: SHA1
In the context of the Cold War, now arriving at the boiling point due
to the Bush/Obama Administration's belligerent posture toward Russia,
the U.S. annexation of Ukraine via a (literally) Nazi proxy force
makes strategic sense:  It was a destabilizing military and economic
provocation against the Russian Federation, and has been followed by a
massive conventional force buildup on Europe's eastern borders, adding
pressure to the weight of U.S. controlled strategic nuclear assets
that were /already/ present on that border.  These deployments must be
countered, which ties up Russian military assets and reduces that
country's force projection capabilities in North Africa and the Middle
Russia's continuing support of the ethnic Russian enclave on Ukraine's
eastern border also makes strategic sense:  It prevents full
consolidation of power by the U.S. installed government, prevents
routine deployment of East-facing U.S. controlled forces on the
Ukraine/Russian border, and provides a potential haven for Ukrainian
insurgents working against the government in Kiev.
Crimea's value to Russia is self explanatory, and I do not recall
hearing anything about the populace turning out to protest the orderly
handover of power to Russia in preference to a U.S. sponsored gang of
(literal) Nazis.  Rather the opposite, and I saw no evidence that the
U.S. even /tried/ to retain Crimea.
The "USA Number One!" mentality of comfortable Middle Class Amerikans
makes sense of a kind: Their continued material prosperity relative to
the former Working Class /does/ depend on global terrorism, enforced
poverty, mass murder, cities reduced to rubble and refugee columns,
etc. as the U.S. war of global economic conquest continues.  They
deserve to see the same things happen to their own children and
families, and if they continue to get their own way they WILL see that
- - unless they happen to be closer to ground zero "on the day."
Unfortunately, this cheerful little scenario involves dragging those
bodies down into the same hell.
The real conflict here is not West vs. East or even USA vs. The Rest
Of The World.  It is the human race, vs. its own parasitic ruling
class and their faithful servants.  The parasites have already lost;
if they do not surrender their power voluntarily (impossible),
environmental limits enforced by the laws of physics will destroy that
power (inevitable).  Now the only game in town is about reducing the
final body count, which no rational scenario places at less than a
couple of billion, and preserving essential long term survival
resources for the survivors.  And that's where radical populist
politics enters the scene.  Communication is vitally important in
political warfare, and providing the best possible tools to Our Side

Thunderbird works for me.  Every message from the CPunks list that
hits the inbox in question lands in a CPunks folder.  New arrivals
cause the folder name in the folders list to change color, and
increment the message count next to the folder name.  "Easy to spot"
becomes a non-issue; new messages are nearly impossible to miss, and
all the messages from the list are viewed in context with the rest of
the messages from the list when the folder is opened.
It is also very easy to create new filter rules to sort a given "from"
address into a CPunks Spam folder, which in my case is about 20% of
the messages from the list.  "One click" enables me to check these for
anything interesting or useful, although such is rarely found.
Adding the list name to every subject line means pushing every subject
line n. spaces to the right, with what I would call redundant visual
clutter.  Looking at the list messages display in Thunderbird I count
six presently visible subject lines that end in ... because they are
longer than the column they appear in, /without/ a redundant list name
in front of them.
That is GMail's semi-equivalent of filtering messages into folders,
but there's a way better method IMO:  Use Thunderbird.  GMail supports
the IMAP protocol, so a GMail account looks and works "the same as" a
real e-mail account when accessed via Thunderbird.  That also cuts the

cause the folder name in the folders list to change color, and
increment the message count next to the folder name.  "Easy to spot"

all the messages from the list are viewed in context with the rest of
the messages from the list when the folder is opened.

the messages from the list.  "One click" enables me to check these for

Thing is, the output of an equation that takes one iteration's output as
input for the next round, etc. is 100% deterministic:  The same
equation, with same initial input, produces the same output every time.
Being unable to predict an iterated feedback function's 9 millionth
digit on its 9 millionth iteration by any means other than actually
iterating it 9 million times qualifies the function as "chaotic."
But chaos is not entropy:  Actually running an iterated function does
enable one to reconstruct the output stream perfectly, while in
cryptography "entropy" means completely unpredictable data that can not
be predicted or reproduced by any means other than recovering a physical
record of the data set in question.
Only physical sources can generate real entropy in this sense:  Decaying
isotopes, noise from a leaky diode, tumbling dice, snapshots of variable
hardware states in a computer (least significant n. digits of CPU
temperature, fan speed, keystroke intervals, etc.) do qualify as
entropy; the Mandlebrot set does not.
This does leave open the possibility of using a true random number (n.
bits of entropy) to seed an iterated function that will "inflate" that
number to any size desired - but no matter how cunning the algorithm,
those n. bits of entropy are all there is, and define the difficulty (or
otherwise) of brute force breaking resulting ciphertexts.
In cryptography, common sense is a major pitfall.  When I first got
interested in modern cryptography, I made the same mistake:  I was quite
sure that the Mandlebrot set would make a super-powerful cryptosystem
possible.  But alas... deterministic functions, however "chaotic" the
output, add no entropy to the initial input.
Math is my weakest subject, so I am indecently proud of having studied
the RSA cipher until I actually understood it well enough to trust it -
20 years ago.  My grand accomplishment was possible because RSA is
surprisingly simple, once presented and explained.  Today:  Don't ask

Punk ass bitches 'round here don't much talk about ciphers.
Only if measures are taken to maintain precise control of these
variables; in practical terms, a human tossing a coin will produce an
unpredictable result every time due to variations in muscle tension, the
path the coin takes, etc.
Again, the outputs of these processes can not be predicted unless their
inputs are under precise control, which in practical situations they are
not.  A big factor here is that the random number generators used to
make cryptographic keys are under the control of the user (or had better
be!), and the user will act to assure that the variables driving the
generator are not monitored to produce predetermined outputs.
This far, physics describes a Universe where the balance of Order and
Chaos is ideal for creating life.  Almost as if somebody set that up on
purpose.  To put a stop to that kind of "superstitious" speculation,
some physicists propose that a vast, unlimited number of distinct
universes must exist, each with its own physical laws, where only a few
have conditions supporting the development of life.  But if so, there
must be a larger cosmic context in which all these universes happen, and
the same speculation arises - how did this massively parallel trial and
error process get started?  Which jumps us up to yet another "higher"
context, etc. ad infinitum.

Given the number of variables involved, it is impractical for an
adversary to measure those variables, and vanishingly improbable for the
coin-tosser to control them well enough to (consciously or otherwise)
predict or control the outcome.  So the practical criteria for "random"
are met.
True that - but in mathematics, people deal with numbers larger than
anything likely to be observed in the gross dimensions of Nature -
excluding combinatorial dimensions, i.e. the number of possible
arrangements of grains of sand on the Earth's beaches, which I am sure
exceeds the diameter of the observable universe measured in millimeters.
Lucky for cryptographers, they get to deal in combinatorial systems
almost exclusively.
Ideally key material would be communicated physically, under conditions
designed to exclude eavesdropping or later exposure of the key to
hostile parties.
Using a large stream of random bits as a unique key (called a one time
pad) provides absolute security against cryptanalysis, provided the key
is not stolen.
A hybrid method where the random bits are "inflated" to a larger bit
stream for use as a key for messages longer than the random key can
work.  But as noted earlier, using a hash function to expand a short key
yields no more entropy; an adversary who knows or guesses what hash
function was used, needs only "brute force" the original short key to
recover the whole ciphertext.
Exobiology is a thing.  In the early days it was a "science without a
subject matter to study" but that has changed.  A long while back, amino
acids were discovered in interstellar dust clouds, indicated by spectral
absorption lines in starlight shining through them.  Closer to home,
comets have been found to contain a wide range of biochemicals.  For
reasons I still don't quite understand, people used to talk about
meteorites from Mars hitting the Earth, and some speculated that life
may have hitched a ride here on them.  Now this:  According to some
measurements, what looks like fragments of tissue and even possible
micro-artifacts containing biological materials are being swept out of
space by the Earth on a truly massive scale:
I lost count of how many dimensions string theory is up to now.  Maybe
19?  As I said, math is my weakest subject.
Dark matter, which I long considered a modern equivalent of the 19th
century's Luminiferous Ether, now appears to be a thing; its structure
has been mapped and space behaves "as if" dark matter was responsible
for the distribution of galaxies made of 'regular' matter.  So there we
have empirical evidence of a 'universe next door' that interacts with
ours exclusively through gravity.
So why not dozens, millions or quadrillions of "universes", each with
its own Big Bang and distinct physical laws, coexisting with our own in
a larger context that contains them all and could be called "the real
If so, that would explain why our space time continuum appears to be
designed to create life, without the necessity for a guiding
intelligence of some kind:  In this scenario our life-generating cosmos
is not special in any way, except that we happen to be inside it.  No
evidence supports this multiple-cosmos model; by definition none can.
But it has become an article of faith among the best educated Atheists;
their religion can't get by without it.

encode and retain more than a tiny fragment of that information, and
language can convey even less.  The verdict of mystical philosophies and
their associated training programs is unanimous:  The ground state of

That is a very tricky issue!  A true random number generator will
eventually output strings like "1234567890" that look anything but
random to a human.  So, does random mean "produced by an unpredictable
physical process," or does it mean "I do not see a pattern in the output
data"?  The latter answer is perilous, because our perceptual systems
seek patterns and happily impose them where none is present; faces seen
in cracked ceiling plaster, etc., are not "there" until we put them
there ourselves.
I see two answers:
A theoretical or abstract answer that says "As long as there is no way
to predict the placement or content of 'orderly' outputs in a stream of
data, that data is random."
A pragmatic answer says "Depending on the application a random number
generator is feeding into, it may be necessary to filter out strings
that present as 'too easy to guess' where and as they appear."
Does this kind of filtering make the remaining 'random' data less
random?  In the sense of "more predictable," yes it does.  But only
slightly, unless the pattern seeking filter is /very/ aggressive.
Calculating the impact of a filter that excludes strings like
"1234567890" from use as "random" data in applications like generating
cipher keys should be simple enough.  Increasing the length of the keys
to compensate for this bias, in the unlikely event that this is
considered worth doing, should be trivial in most cases.
Definitely.  Because of the close connection between the concept of
"random" and concrete physical phenomena that are easy to visualize and
manipulate in imagination, even I can understand and play with these ideas.

The Nolan Chart, beloved recruiting tool of the Libertarian Party, works
reliably as such because - along with the associated diagnostic
instrument - it measures and graphs the desire of the individual for ego
gratification and freedom of action. Anyone who passes the Nolan test by landing in the "Libertarian"
quadrant - a foregone conclusion for most healthy adults - should
proceed from this introspective analysis to consideration of which
political / economic system would offer the best shot at implementing
their lifestyle choices as "rugged individualists."  The Nolan
instrument provides no help, as its diagnostic output indicates personal
preferences among a set of stereotyped partisan sales pitches - not the
net impact of competing public policy agendas on individual "freedom." The Nolan test indicates what people believe about themselves, not the
actual motives that affect their actions - otherwise, the inevitable
conversion of our society to a Libertarian model of governance would
have happened decades ago. To represent something more like the real world, I propose a somewhat
different graph to represent a two dimensional array of political /
economic organizational principles:  The vertical axis represents State
power mediated by applied violence as an Authoritarian / Anarchist
scale; the horizontal axis represents Private power mediated by applied
economic force on a Capitalism / Free Enterprise scale.  The upper left
corner represents total concentration of power in the fewest hands, the
lower right corner represents uniform distribution of power across an
entire population.  Kinney Chart
The Capitalism / Free Enterprise axis raises immediate objections from
many observers, due to the indoctrinated belief that Capitalism /is/
Free Enterprise.  In my observation and experience, corporate capitalism
makes itself the natural enemy of free enterprise:  Powerful
corporations enforce their market dominance by any means necessary, from
sponsoring legislation and controlling regulatory policy to suppress
independent competitors,  to dumping look-alike products on the market
until smaller enterprises are bankrupted.  This behavior may be
"illegal" but in litigation as elsewhere, money is power and the real
golden rule says:  A player who shows up with orders of magnitude more
gold than the other player wins.  A buy-out removing the independent
small business from the market by mutual agreement is the best case
scenario for an independent enterprise in conflict with a well funded
corporate adversary. I have placed the political Left and Right on the chart, to indicate
their functional features in the chart's context:  The actual players
whose followers call themselves Liberals and Conservatives all seek to
conserve and advance the concentration of financial power in the hands
of an elite minority (corporate capitalists), differing only on whether
that economic power should be consolidated and exercised indirectly
through State institutions or directly through Private cartels. If most people who identify as Libertarian would rather live in the
lower right quadrant of the above graph, so sorry.  That Party offers no
such program or agenda:  Only a hollow promise that incorruptible Civil
Courts will deliver equal justice to penniless individuals and corporate
cartels, and that the infallible invisible hand of the Free Market will
prevent systemic abuse of corporate power.  If Fascism is defined as
"the merger of Corporate and State power," the Libertarian agenda is not
Fascist.  In practical terms, the Libertarian agenda could be described
as an effort to achieve full replacement of State power by Corporate
power.  One might call the result a Plutocratic Oligarchy.
That is why I call my own orientation and agenda Anarchism.  My
preferred quadrant of the above graph is the lower right one:  Broadly
distributed political and economic power among autonomous local
communities.  Clockwise from lower left, I associate the quadrants with
Free Market Capitalism, Socialist State Capitalism, Feudal Aristocracy
and Tribal Federations.  All loosely defined, as is proper with high
level abstract labels.  All have their upsides and downsides, but Tribal
Federations have, so far, produced the least harmful results overall. Can that model make a comeback in the post-industrial world?  I think
so, but that outcome depends entirely on economic drivers:  Will the
global industrial economy crash, and if so, can it recover in its
present form?  I think the crash will happen, and recovery to "the old
normal" will not.
What the hell, it's something to play with.

I would not say that most healthy adults are Libertarians; I would say
that the Nolan Chart should diagnose most healthy adults as
Libertarians.  That's what makes it a high value recruiting tool for the
Libertarian Party.  "What you always were has a name, and even a
political party working for what YOU want!"  Anyone working for any
Party can /say/ that to anyone else, but the Libertarians present a
convincing illusion of objective proof. Whether the likely outcomes of implementing the Party's policy agenda
resemble the promised results, bears no relation to the recruitment
Any analysis at this level of abstraction will have plenty of
ambiguities.  I was aiming for "common sense" a.k.a. propaganda driven
terminology, with breaking certain "common sense" paradigms in mind. Filling in the details is up to the individual.  That's where the fun is.
In a context where ownership of capital is highly concentrated in the
hands of a small minority, but access to armed force is widely
distributed across the population, you might get Robber Barons:  More or
less the "Right."
In a context where ownership of capital is highly concentrated in the
hands of a small minority, and access to armed force is highly
concentrated in the hands of a small minority, you might get
NeoLiberals:  More or less the "Left."
These outcomes are not inherent in the model, but given that the Left
and Right as described here already dominate the playing field... The Libertarian Party does divert a lot of bright, capable people down a
blind alley.  They are presented with a believable ideology that, if
adopted as national policy, would remove present restraints (such as
they are) from our Robber Baron capitalists.  Whether this is a good or
bad idea is left as an exercise.
Again, a lot depends on the definitions of highly abstract terms.  In a
localized, decentralized system of governance, the inhabitants of any
given self governing region could do whatever they damn well please
about regulating commerce and addressing the impact of industrial
processes on resources of value to the community, i.e. what the folks
upstream are doing to the water you irrigate your fields with.  In the
event of conflicting interests some sort of settlement will be worked
out, with or without resort to brute force.   The definition of anarchy as the absence of governance would be a joke,
if it was not a very well established article of indoctrinated faith,
bestowed on us by our forbears' authoritarian rulers.  People organize
into groups and make collective decisions; those who don't have that
trait went extinct ages ago.  How they do that, and at what scale, have
varied widely.  In my view, the smaller the units of governance, the
more widely distributed the decision making process, and the fewer
barriers to participation the better.  To err is human and every form of
governance fucks up; but, generally speaking, tribal councils that act
by consensus seem to have done the least harm. Let's see:  The red quadrant indicates high concentration of economic
power in the hands of a small number of people, plus distribution of
power mediated by armed force across a large number of people.  The
power of a wealthy minority, not restrained by rules enforced by an
armed central authority, sounds like Free Market Capitalism to me.  With
that concentration of wealth, it should be no problem for an economic
ruling class to hire enough mercenaries to protect their interests from
all those armed citizens. Note that capitalism != corporatism, it only indicates a specialization
in acquisition and growth of private wealth. Made up?  Far from it.  A tribal federation is a group of local
councils, coordinating regional relations with other councils by treaty
agreements.  It was the dominant form of governance in North America
when the Europeans showed up in force with superior technology.  We are
not taught about the tribal council and federation model, because it is
important for us to understand that the natives were "ignorant savages,
incapable of organizing and governing themselves."  Otherwise, what
becomes of Manifest Destiny and the White Man's Burden? The graph seems to account exactly for plain old state
socialism/communitsm:  See the dot marked "Left."  Maximum concentration
of economic power in the hands of a minority (State appointed
functionaries), plus maximum concentration of coercive force in the
hands of a minority (State legal, police, and military activities).  How
is that inconsistent with plain old state socialism/communism? Depends one's definition of "soon."  I do expect today's global economic
system to crash, hard, within 10 to 20 years, taking "heavy industry"
and long range transportation of bulk material commodities with it.  Not
completely, but sufficiently to cause a domino effect leading to a
significant human population crash. I could be wrong in this case, but exponential growth inside a closed
container usually ends badly for whatever is growing exponentially,
and/or for its container.  In the context of human affairs, that end
typically comes as a shocking surprise because exponential growth
functions are counter-intuitive; our normative bias leads us to expect
linear change where we anticipate any change at all.  The immediate self
interest of millions of human actors whose combined decision making
drives the exponential growth of industrial process, biases the lot of
them toward magical thinking - even those who /can/ accurately imagine
exponential processes. Just now, peak extraction rates for many non-regenerating environmental
resources are arriving at the same time; the humans have been spending
down their 'natural capital' faster than Donald Trump spending down his
inheritance to maintain the illusion that he is a brilliantly successful
businessman.  One of the more alarming features of material economics
today, is that the rising curve of food demand and falling curve of food
production rates are presently crossing, while essential inputs to
agriculture (and animal husbandry) - potable water, topsoil, phosphates
- have reached or passed peak utilization rates.  Worldwide, food
reserves are at historic lows and resupply is not expected. Our industrial civilization is brittle, but the humans themselves are
very resilient.  Although I do expect Very Bad Things to happen, I see
lots of room for very good long term outcomes.

In the context of Col. Prouty's presentation of the history of U.S.
involvement in Southeast Asia, this would be a case where Special Forces
means Central Intelligence Agency.
Where and as the well justified paranoia of "cooler heads" in Washington
limited the CIA's access to funding, manpower and matériel for
anti-Communist operations, Dulles and his guise had legal authorities
and practical procedures for borrowing the resources of any branch of
the U.S. military.  For "borrowing" read "co-opting and infiltrating."
Whole units became de facto CIA assets where and as required, along with
effectively unlimited supplies of arms, vehicles, etc., all on the books
as Army, Navy or etc. assets.  After the operations in question were
concluded, the personnel involved who had been read in regarding their
temporary roles remained as de facto permanent agents in place,
available on call for any favors etc. as required.
CIA was supposed to reimburse the various services for the costs of
their cooperation.  The fact that such operations ever happened was
disclosed only to properly cleared personnel on a need to know basis, so
those in Pentagon accounting positions relevant to this process became
de facto "double agents."  They took all that information with them when
transferred or promoted, so the payment obligations in question often
got lost in the shuffle.
How this creative accounting process evolved alongside the development
of electronic bookkeeping methods since Prouty's day has not, as far as
I know, been publicly disclosed.  But that it did so successfully is a
foregone conclusion.

Next month in Washington DC, if the Nazi and KKK guise don't smarten up

The first source I noted was this from UK Independent:
(Short URL is quoted from the article.)
Anyone who calls me "Red" indicates that he or she likes calling people
names.  No more, no less, and in present company who cares?
I figure there's no right place on the Left / Right political spectrum.
A one dimensional model can not represent anything real. About the only
thing the Left / Right model is good for is to determine how morally
superior oneslef is to a given other, based on how far away that other
is on the said scale. One of the reasons I call myself an anarchist is I
just don't play that.
On the Left / Right scale, I am absolutely evil, not relatively evil.
And I am apparently a supernatural entity, because I can move freely
through higher dimensions than observers whose perception is limited to
the Left / Right spectrum.
Anyone who calls me "Red" because I criticize Nazis and KKK guise, or
celebrate their failures, identifies him or herself as one of them.
That means in heart and mind OR through literal club membership status,
and frankly the "passive apologists" are the deadlier ones, the
noncombatant support network a handful of actual wannabe SA Brown Shirts
would need to survive their first 24 hours.
On the Left / Right spectrum, the Nazis and Klan are the knot in the end
of the line, one with 13 turns and a convenient sliding action.  As
there is a danger that they will use it, we do have to watch for that -
they have a "special" history.  On the plus side if those guys start
acting out their fantasies, the means for their correction will be close
at hand.
Having seen pictures of the I'm talking about, obviously taken at
different times with different cameras, and read multiple news accounts,
I am surprised by the lack of any visible or audible counter-protesters
in the video presented.  Also the lack of a massive police protective
presence, mentioned in multiple sources.
Pardon my skepticism, but "live streamed" can also mean "recorded before
the event and replayed into YouTube."  Or even enacted at another site.
But let's imaging that a bunch of people protesting for or against
various Fascist Neutral political causes de jour just stood there while
yapping about their free speech rights being violated.
And 15,000 people showed up at what they /believed/ was a NeoNazi pep
rally, to say Fuck You.
That's game over for America's Grassroots Fascists for at least one more
generation.  The Court of American public opinion has spoken, and a guy
following you around with a Souzaphone will always have the last laugh.

Capitalism "got murdered"?
I guess the L Curve model will need to be revised or discarded then.
The perpetrator who murdered Capitalism was someone called "the left"?
Where can I donate to their legal defense fund?  Just kidding... in real
life there is no Left or Right except as closely allied, mutually
dependent criminal gangs competing for larger shares of plunder.
In the context of popular political beliefs, Left and Right mean Good
and Evil relative to which end of the scale the True Believer at hand
identifies with.  This result has been obtained by a complex of long
term domestic and international political warfare strategies I call
Divide The Conquered.
People with a neurotic fixation on the notional Left / Right scale
present very convincing rationalizations and context-free cherry picked
data proving that Left and Right are fundamentally different, even
opposites.  They are supported by whole industries devoted to promoting
these beliefs and their common frame of reference.  But when implemented
as State policy, Left and Right ideologies are most distinguishable by
which of their common mechanisms are publicized and which are hidden
from public view.
Once the above frame of reference is on the table, we may see options
other than participating in the Divide The Conquered game where by
definition we start and finish glued into the loser's seat.  Until we do
find other options, business as usual is safe from meddling by the great
unwashed masses whose proper place is on a treadmill of production /

As you are well aware, in the context of Nazi / KKK propaganda "Aryan"
means stereotypically northwest European.
So far your presentation demonstrates how little the Nazi / KKK guise
have going for them:  No matter how intelligent, articulate, etc. some
of them may be, the only way for them to sell their core propositions on
any basis other than exploiting fear > anger > hate, is clever word
games.  And the odd Classic Propaganda Technique here and there.
Hmm.  I think I will change "ad hominem" to "kill the messenger" in my
list of Classic Propaganda Techniques.  It's instantly self explanatory,
easier for a newcomer to remember and apply.
I mean the losing team that handed their opponents on the ground a
martyr a little over a week ago.  The ones 15k+ people turned out to say
"Fuck You" to in Boston one week later.
Our overt Nazi / KKK folks went too public, too fast, and got burned.
They polarized the public and mobilized an opposition that outnumbers
them by at least 200 to 1.  They will fade back into the shadows, except
for the few required to run an aggressive propaganda front on the
networks - under the close guidance of professionals, or so it appears
from the quality and volume distribution of their recent product.
I wonder if Mr. Bannon dropped out so he could work full time on that
project, without risk of premature exposure and a backlash against the
still very useful Trump Administration.  Say what you will about Steve
Bannon, he is an adversary to be proud of:  Beat him and you did
something worthwhile and not at all easy.
The sponsors of the Nazi / KKK propaganda efforts do deserve bonus
points for prompting our NeoLiberal mass media outlets to pick up and
actively promote their "free speech" talking points.  This leverages
NeoLiberal corporate directives to damage the anarchist associations
that run Antifa in any way possible - a smart move.  Turns out the Left
Loves Nazis, when it is to their advantage to do so, and nice polite
middle class racists are a largely untapped market.
You may not have mentioned the Nazi / KKK guise by name, just repeated
their principal talking points and now continue to fight for them.
Calling the causes you advocate for by their right names is a losing
move, because the terms "Nazi" and "KKK" carry 100% negative
connotations for everyone except members and committed supporters.
Pretending at NPOV also makes one sound much more rational and reasonable.
You presentation models the behavior you want your audience to emulate.
Pretending to be a neutral observer who clearly sees why the Nazi / KKK
crowd is "in the right" is much more effective than saying, "Well I side
with the organizers of Unite The Right, and the Nazis say..."
Maybe I am projecting a little:  I study propaganda, and your
presentation indicate an author or authors who also study propaganda.
When this model is "projected" over your placements, it simplifies
analysis:  Bush league amateur or top flight professional, the
techniques are the same.
Please DO show up in DC, wearing/carrying your employers' symbols of
White Nationalist Pride.  Walk right into a crowd of Juggalos and
explain to them why you are on their side and they should be on yours.
I'm sure they will be more than happy to embrace your presentation and
welcome you to the Dark Carnival.  I bet they will even comp you for
your first visit to the House Of Illusions.

Around these parts we already have people advocating for direct

In part that depends on the definition of "denial."  I have not made a
special effort to evaluate the claims pro and con, but from what I have
seen it does appear that:  1)  It definitely happened, no question about
that, but 2) the numbers were significantly exaggerated, even above and
beyond Zionist propaganda counting /all/ the casualties as Jewish.
Lots of people would call that "Holocaust Denial."  It's illegal to say
say those things in Germany, last I heard.
People call Chomsky an "intellectual" so often that I have to wonder if
it's on his business card and letterhead, and the short list of branding
themes his publicist carries around.
I would be more likely to call Chomsky an "ideologue."  Every few years
Chomsky makes a cluster of widely publicized statements indicating a
rational, practical understanding of political affairs.  But that
appears to be loss leader material aimed at attracting attention,
because soon after, widely publicized straight up Party Line propaganda
follows.  Me:  "Has Chomsky gone off the reservation?" Me one week
later: "Nope, back to the same old prollfeed for self identifying Middle
Class Liberals."
So when Chomsky says that studies with a potential to disclose
information with beneficial medical applications is "of no value," he
means "of no value to my mission as a propagandist."
At one time, eugenics told us all about which "races" are morally and
intellectually better or worse than others, which gave a lovely veneer
of Scientism to the work of violent racist political factions.  In
reaction against this, the behavioral and social sciences adopted an
equally politicized position that all humans are born as blank slates
with identical potentials in every area, period, and set about proving
it to the best of their ability.  Today, this seems to have mostly
sorted itself, and genetics, the prenatal chemical environment, and the
impact of post-natal environmental imprints and conditioned responses
are all recognized as contributory factors to cognitive and behavioral
traits that vary from person to person.
Propagandists need all-encompassing talking points; their audiences
demand instant E-Z unchanging one size fits all answers and "If I don't
provide them, someone else will."  Never mind the cha-ching of the cash
register in the background, and the resulting inability of their
indoctrinated audiences to do anything but fight among themselves as
directed while their rulers make all the decisions that control their
lives and destinies.
So they sigh, shake their heads sorrowfully and say "Some problems won't
be solved in our lifetimes," and get back to work making things worse
because the mortgage doesn't pay itself.

@_subject: new idea for random number generation 
Thing is, the output of an equation that takes one iteration's output as
input for the next round, etc. is 100% deterministic:  The same
equation, with same initial input, produces the same output every time.
Being unable to predict an iterated feedback function's 9 millionth
digit on its 9 millionth iteration by any means other than actually
iterating it 9 million times qualifies the function as "chaotic."
But chaos is not entropy:  Actually running an iterated function does
enable one to reconstruct the output stream perfectly, while in
cryptography "entropy" means completely unpredictable data that can not
be predicted or reproduced by any means other than recovering a physical
record of the data set in question.
Only physical sources can generate real entropy in this sense:  Decaying
isotopes, noise from a leaky diode, tumbling dice, snapshots of variable
hardware states in a computer (least significant n. digits of CPU
temperature, fan speed, keystroke intervals, etc.) do qualify as
entropy; the Mandlebrot set does not.
This does leave open the possibility of using a true random number (n.
bits of entropy) to seed an iterated function that will "inflate" that
number to any size desired - but no matter how cunning the algorithm,
those n. bits of entropy are all there is, and define the difficulty (or
otherwise) of brute force breaking resulting ciphertexts.
In cryptography, common sense is a major pitfall.  When I first got
interested in modern cryptography, I made the same mistake:  I was quite
sure that the Mandlebrot set would make a super-powerful cryptosystem
possible.  But alas... deterministic functions, however "chaotic" the
output, add no entropy to the initial input.
Math is my weakest subject, so I am indecently proud of having studied
the RSA cipher until I actually understood it well enough to trust it -
20 years ago.  My grand accomplishment was possible because RSA is
surprisingly simple, once presented and explained.  Today:  Don't ask
me, math is my weakest subject.

Punk ass bitches 'round here don't much talk about ciphers.
Only if measures are taken to maintain precise control of these
variables; in practical terms, a human tossing a coin will produce an
unpredictable result every time due to variations in muscle tension, the
path the coin takes, etc.
Again, the outputs of these processes can not be predicted unless their
inputs are under precise control, which in practical situations they are
not.  A big factor here is that the random number generators used to
make cryptographic keys are under the control of the user (or had better
be!), and the user will act to assure that the variables driving the
generator are not monitored to produce predetermined outputs.
This far, physics describes a Universe where the balance of Order and
Chaos is ideal for creating life.  Almost as if somebody set that up on
purpose.  To put a stop to that kind of "superstitious" speculation,
some physicists propose that a vast, unlimited number of distinct
universes must exist, each with its own physical laws, where only a few
have conditions supporting the development of life.  But if so, there
must be a larger cosmic context in which all these universes happen, and
the same speculation arises - how did this massively parallel trial and
error process get started?  Which jumps us up to yet another "higher"
context, etc. ad infinitum.

Given the number of variables involved, it is impractical for an
adversary to measure those variables, and vanishingly improbable for the
coin-tosser to control them well enough to (consciously or otherwise)
predict or control the outcome.  So the practical criteria for "random"
are met.
True that - but in mathematics, people deal with numbers larger than
anything likely to be observed in the gross dimensions of Nature -
excluding combinatorial dimensions, i.e. the number of possible
arrangements of grains of sand on the Earth's beaches, which I am sure
exceeds the diameter of the observable universe measured in millimeters.
Lucky for cryptographers, they get to deal in combinatorial systems
almost exclusively.
Ideally key material would be communicated physically, under conditions
designed to exclude eavesdropping or later exposure of the key to
hostile parties.
Using a large stream of random bits as a unique key (called a one time
pad) provides absolute security against cryptanalysis, provided the key
is not stolen.
A hybrid method where the random bits are "inflated" to a larger bit
stream for use as a key for messages longer than the random key can
work.  But as noted earlier, using a hash function to expand a short key
yields no more entropy; an adversary who knows or guesses what hash
function was used, needs only "brute force" the original short key to
recover the whole ciphertext.
Exobiology is a thing.  In the early days it was a "science without a
subject matter to study" but that has changed.  A long while back, amino
acids were discovered in interstellar dust clouds, indicated by spectral
absorption lines in starlight shining through them.  Closer to home,
comets have been found to contain a wide range of biochemicals.  For
reasons I still don't quite understand, people used to talk about
meteorites from Mars hitting the Earth, and some speculated that life
may have hitched a ride here on them.  Now this:  According to some
measurements, what looks like fragments of tissue and even possible
micro-artifacts containing biological materials are being swept out of
space by the Earth on a truly massive scale:
I lost count of how many dimensions string theory is up to now.  Maybe
19?  As I said, math is my weakest subject.
Dark matter, which I long considered a modern equivalent of the 19th
century's Luminiferous Ether, now appears to be a thing; its structure
has been mapped and space behaves "as if" dark matter was responsible
for the distribution of galaxies made of 'regular' matter.  So there we
have empirical evidence of a 'universe next door' that interacts with
ours exclusively through gravity.
So why not dozens, millions or quadrillions of "universes", each with
its own Big Bang and distinct physical laws, coexisting with our own in
a larger context that contains them all and could be called "the real
If so, that would explain why our space time continuum appears to be
designed to create life, without the necessity for a guiding
intelligence of some kind:  In this scenario our life-generating cosmos
is not special in any way, except that we happen to be inside it.  No
evidence supports this multiple-cosmos model; by definition none can.
But it has become an article of faith among the best educated Atheists;
their religion can't get by without it.
Maybe there are.  Maybe in some sense I know some of those answers - I
have had some very unusual experiences as results from intensive
practice of mystical techniques.  But alas:  The physical brain can not
encode and retain more than a tiny fragment of that information, and
language can convey even less.  The verdict of mystical philosophies and
their associated training programs is unanimous:  The ground state of
reality can not be described or explained, you have to go and see for

That is a very tricky issue!  A true random number generator will
eventually output strings like "1234567890" that look anything but
random to a human.  So, does random mean "produced by an unpredictable
physical process," or does it mean "I do not see a pattern in the output
data"?  The latter answer is perilous, because our perceptual systems
seek patterns and happily impose them where none is present; faces seen
in cracked ceiling plaster, etc., are not "there" until we put them
there ourselves.
I see two answers:
A theoretical or abstract answer that says "As long as there is no way
to predict the placement or content of 'orderly' outputs in a stream of
data, that data is random."
A pragmatic answer says "Depending on the application a random number
generator is feeding into, it may be necessary to filter out strings
that present as 'too easy to guess' where and as they appear."
Does this kind of filtering make the remaining 'random' data less
random?  In the sense of "more predictable," yes it does.  But only
slightly, unless the pattern seeking filter is /very/ aggressive.
Calculating the impact of a filter that excludes strings like
"1234567890" from use as "random" data in applications like generating
cipher keys should be simple enough.  Increasing the length of the keys
to compensate for this bias, in the unlikely event that this is
considered worth doing, should be trivial in most cases.
Definitely.  Because of the close connection between the concept of
"random" and concrete physical phenomena that are easy to visualize and
manipulate in imagination, even I can understand and play with these ideas.

The Nolan Chart, beloved recruiting tool of the Libertarian Party, works
reliably as such because - along with the associated diagnostic
instrument - it measures and graphs the desire of the individual for ego
gratification and freedom of action. Anyone who passes the Nolan test by landing in the "Libertarian"
quadrant - a foregone conclusion for most healthy adults - should
proceed from this introspective analysis to consideration of which
political / economic system would offer the best shot at implementing
their lifestyle choices as "rugged individualists."  The Nolan
instrument provides no help, as its diagnostic output indicates personal
preferences among a set of stereotyped partisan sales pitches - not the
net impact of competing public policy agendas on individual "freedom." The Nolan test indicates what people believe about themselves, not the
actual motives that affect their actions - otherwise, the inevitable
conversion of our society to a Libertarian model of governance would
have happened decades ago. To represent something more like the real world, I propose a somewhat
different graph to represent a two dimensional array of political /
economic organizational principles:  The vertical axis represents State
power mediated by applied violence as an Authoritarian / Anarchist
scale; the horizontal axis represents Private power mediated by applied
economic force on a Capitalism / Free Enterprise scale.  The upper left
corner represents total concentration of power in the fewest hands, the
lower right corner represents uniform distribution of power across an
entire population.  Kinney Chart
The Capitalism / Free Enterprise axis raises immediate objections from
many observers, due to the indoctrinated belief that Capitalism /is/
Free Enterprise.  In my observation and experience, corporate capitalism
makes itself the natural enemy of free enterprise:  Powerful
corporations enforce their market dominance by any means necessary, from
sponsoring legislation and controlling regulatory policy to suppress
independent competitors,  to dumping look-alike products on the market
until smaller enterprises are bankrupted.  This behavior may be
"illegal" but in litigation as elsewhere, money is power and the real
golden rule says:  A player who shows up with orders of magnitude more
gold than the other player wins.  A buy-out removing the independent
small business from the market by mutual agreement is the best case
scenario for an independent enterprise in conflict with a well funded
corporate adversary. I have placed the political Left and Right on the chart, to indicate
their functional features in the chart's context:  The actual players
whose followers call themselves Liberals and Conservatives all seek to
conserve and advance the concentration of financial power in the hands
of an elite minority (corporate capitalists), differing only on whether
that economic power should be consolidated and exercised indirectly
through State institutions or directly through Private cartels. If most people who identify as Libertarian would rather live in the
lower right quadrant of the above graph, so sorry.  That Party offers no
such program or agenda:  Only a hollow promise that incorruptible Civil
Courts will deliver equal justice to penniless individuals and corporate
cartels, and that the infallible invisible hand of the Free Market will
prevent systemic abuse of corporate power.  If Fascism is defined as
"the merger of Corporate and State power," the Libertarian agenda is not
Fascist.  In practical terms, the Libertarian agenda could be described
as an effort to achieve full replacement of State power by Corporate
power.  One might call the result a Plutocratic Oligarchy.
That is why I call my own orientation and agenda Anarchism.  My
preferred quadrant of the above graph is the lower right one:  Broadly
distributed political and economic power among autonomous local
communities.  Clockwise from lower left, I associate the quadrants with
Free Market Capitalism, Socialist State Capitalism, Feudal Aristocracy
and Tribal Federations.  All loosely defined, as is proper with high
level abstract labels.  All have their upsides and downsides, but Tribal
Federations have, so far, produced the least harmful results overall. Can that model make a comeback in the post-industrial world?  I think
so, but that outcome depends entirely on economic drivers:  Will the
global industrial economy crash, and if so, can it recover in its
present form?  I think the crash will happen, and recovery to "the old
normal" will not.
What the hell, it's something to play with.

I would not say that most healthy adults are Libertarians; I would say
that the Nolan Chart should diagnose most healthy adults as
Libertarians.  That's what makes it a high value recruiting tool for the
Libertarian Party.  "What you always were has a name, and even a
political party working for what YOU want!"  Anyone working for any
Party can /say/ that to anyone else, but the Libertarians present a
convincing illusion of objective proof. Whether the likely outcomes of implementing the Party's policy agenda
resemble the promised results, bears no relation to the recruitment
Any analysis at this level of abstraction will have plenty of
ambiguities.  I was aiming for "common sense" a.k.a. propaganda driven
terminology, with breaking certain "common sense" paradigms in mind. Filling in the details is up to the individual.  That's where the fun is.
In a context where ownership of capital is highly concentrated in the
hands of a small minority, but access to armed force is widely
distributed across the population, you might get Robber Barons:  More or
less the "Right."
In a context where ownership of capital is highly concentrated in the
hands of a small minority, and access to armed force is highly
concentrated in the hands of a small minority, you might get
NeoLiberals:  More or less the "Left."
These outcomes are not inherent in the model, but given that the Left
and Right as described here already dominate the playing field... The Libertarian Party does divert a lot of bright, capable people down a
blind alley.  They are presented with a believable ideology that, if
adopted as national policy, would remove present restraints (such as
they are) from our Robber Baron capitalists.  Whether this is a good or
bad idea is left as an exercise.
Again, a lot depends on the definitions of highly abstract terms.  In a
localized, decentralized system of governance, the inhabitants of any
given self governing region could do whatever they damn well please
about regulating commerce and addressing the impact of industrial
processes on resources of value to the community, i.e. what the folks
upstream are doing to the water you irrigate your fields with.  In the
event of conflicting interests some sort of settlement will be worked
out, with or without resort to brute force.   The definition of anarchy as the absence of governance would be a joke,
if it was not a very well established article of indoctrinated faith,
bestowed on us by our forbears' authoritarian rulers.  People organize
into groups and make collective decisions; those who don't have that
trait went extinct ages ago.  How they do that, and at what scale, have
varied widely.  In my view, the smaller the units of governance, the
more widely distributed the decision making process, and the fewer
barriers to participation the better.  To err is human and every form of
governance fucks up; but, generally speaking, tribal councils that act
by consensus seem to have done the least harm. Let's see:  The red quadrant indicates high concentration of economic
power in the hands of a small number of people, plus distribution of
power mediated by armed force across a large number of people.  The
power of a wealthy minority, not restrained by rules enforced by an
armed central authority, sounds like Free Market Capitalism to me.  With
that concentration of wealth, it should be no problem for an economic
ruling class to hire enough mercenaries to protect their interests from
all those armed citizens. Note that capitalism != corporatism, it only indicates a specialization
in acquisition and growth of private wealth. Made up?  Far from it.  A tribal federation is a group of local
councils, coordinating regional relations with other councils by treaty
agreements.  It was the dominant form of governance in North America
when the Europeans showed up in force with superior technology.  We are
not taught about the tribal council and federation model, because it is
important for us to understand that the natives were "ignorant savages,
incapable of organizing and governing themselves."  Otherwise, what
becomes of Manifest Destiny and the White Man's Burden? The graph seems to account exactly for plain old state
socialism/communitsm:  See the dot marked "Left."  Maximum concentration
of economic power in the hands of a minority (State appointed
functionaries), plus maximum concentration of coercive force in the
hands of a minority (State legal, police, and military activities).  How
is that inconsistent with plain old state socialism/communism? Depends one's definition of "soon."  I do expect today's global economic
system to crash, hard, within 10 to 20 years, taking "heavy industry"
and long range transportation of bulk material commodities with it.  Not
completely, but sufficiently to cause a domino effect leading to a
significant human population crash. I could be wrong in this case, but exponential growth inside a closed
container usually ends badly for whatever is growing exponentially,
and/or for its container.  In the context of human affairs, that end
typically comes as a shocking surprise because exponential growth
functions are counter-intuitive; our normative bias leads us to expect
linear change where we anticipate any change at all.  The immediate self
interest of millions of human actors whose combined decision making
drives the exponential growth of industrial process, biases the lot of
them toward magical thinking - even those who /can/ accurately imagine
exponential processes. Just now, peak extraction rates for many non-regenerating environmental
resources are arriving at the same time; the humans have been spending
down their 'natural capital' faster than Donald Trump spending down his
inheritance to maintain the illusion that he is a brilliantly successful
businessman.  One of the more alarming features of material economics
today, is that the rising curve of food demand and falling curve of food
production rates are presently crossing, while essential inputs to
agriculture (and animal husbandry) - potable water, topsoil, phosphates
- have reached or passed peak utilization rates.  Worldwide, food
reserves are at historic lows and resupply is not expected. Our industrial civilization is brittle, but the humans themselves are
very resilient.  Although I do expect Very Bad Things to happen, I see
lots of room for very good long term outcomes.

Woah!  I did not find any way to access these documents at hoover.org,,
but follow the network bread crumbs to solid gold:
In the context of Col. Prouty's presentation of the history of U.S.
involvement in Southeast Asia, this would be a case where Special Forces
means Central Intelligence Agency.
Where and as the well justified paranoia of "cooler heads" in Washington
limited the CIA's access to funding, manpower and matériel for
anti-Communist operations, Dulles and his guise had legal authorities
and practical procedures for borrowing the resources of any branch of
the U.S. military.  For "borrowing" read "co-opting and infiltrating."
Whole units became de facto CIA assets where and as required, along with
effectively unlimited supplies of arms, vehicles, etc., all on the books
as Army, Navy or etc. assets.  After the operations in question were
concluded, the personnel involved who had been read in regarding their
temporary roles remained as de facto permanent agents in place,
available on call for any favors etc. as required.
CIA was supposed to reimburse the various services for the costs of
their cooperation.  The fact that such operations ever happened was
disclosed only to properly cleared personnel on a need to know basis, so
those in Pentagon accounting positions relevant to this process became
de facto "double agents."  They took all that information with them when
transferred or promoted, so the payment obligations in question often
got lost in the shuffle.
How this creative accounting process evolved alongside the development
of electronic bookkeeping methods since Prouty's day has not, as far as
I know, been publicly disclosed.  But that it did so successfully is a
foregone conclusion.

(Short URL is quoted from the article.)
Anyone who calls me "Red" indicates that he or she likes calling people
names.  No more, no less, and in present company who cares?
I figure there's no right place on the Left / Right political spectrum.
A one dimensional model can not represent anything real. About the only
thing the Left / Right model is good for is to determine how morally
superior oneslef is to a given other, based on how far away that other
is on the said scale. One of the reasons I call myself an anarchist is I
just don't play that.
On the Left / Right scale, I am absolutely evil, not relatively evil.
And I am apparently a supernatural entity, because I can move freely
through higher dimensions than observers whose perception is limited to
the Left / Right spectrum.
Anyone who calls me "Red" because I criticize Nazis and KKK guise, or
celebrate their failures, identifies him or herself as one of them.
That means in heart and mind OR through literal club membership status,
and frankly the "passive apologists" are the deadlier ones, the
noncombatant support network a handful of actual wannabe SA Brown Shirts
would need to survive their first 24 hours.
On the Left / Right spectrum, the Nazis and Klan are the knot in the end
of the line, one with 13 turns and a convenient sliding action.  As
there is a danger that they will use it, we do have to watch for that -
they have a "special" history.  On the plus side if those guys start
acting out their fantasies, the means for their correction will be close
at hand.
Having seen pictures of the I'm talking about, obviously taken at
different times with different cameras, and read multiple news accounts,
I am surprised by the lack of any visible or audible counter-protesters
in the video presented.  Also the lack of a massive police protective
presence, mentioned in multiple sources.
Pardon my skepticism, but "live streamed" can also mean "recorded before
the event and replayed into YouTube."  Or even enacted at another site.
But let's imaging that a bunch of people protesting for or against
various Fascist Neutral political causes de jour just stood there while
yapping about their free speech rights being violated.
And 15,000 people showed up at what they /believed/ was a NeoNazi pep
rally, to say Fuck You.
That's game over for America's Grassroots Fascists for at least one more

The perpetrator who murdered Capitalism was someone called "the left"?
Where can I donate to their legal defense fund?  Just kidding... in real
life there is no Left or Right except as closely allied, mutually

In the context of popular political beliefs, Left and Right mean Good

identifies with.  This result has been obtained by a complex of long

Divide The Conquered.
People with a neurotic fixation on the notional Left / Right scale
present very convincing rationalizations and context-free cherry picked
data proving that Left and Right are fundamentally different, even
opposites.  They are supported by whole industries devoted to promoting
these beliefs and their common frame of reference.  But when implemented
as State policy, Left and Right ideologies are most distinguishable by
which of their common mechanisms are publicized and which are hidden
from public view.
Once the above frame of reference is on the table, we may see options
other than participating in the Divide The Conquered game where by
definition we start and finish glued into the loser's seat.  Until we do

As you are well aware, in the context of Nazi / KKK propaganda "Aryan"
means stereotypically northwest European.
So far your presentation demonstrates how little the Nazi / KKK guise
have going for them:  No matter how intelligent, articulate, etc. some
of them may be, the only way for them to sell their core propositions on
any basis other than exploiting fear > anger > hate, is clever word
games.  And the odd Classic Propaganda Technique here and there.
Hmm.  I think I will change "ad hominem" to "kill the messenger" in my
list of Classic Propaganda Techniques.  It's instantly self explanatory,
easier for a newcomer to remember and apply.
I mean the losing team that handed their opponents on the ground a
martyr a little over a week ago.  The ones 15k+ people turned out to say
"Fuck You" to in Boston one week later.
Our overt Nazi / KKK folks went too public, too fast, and got burned.
They polarized the public and mobilized an opposition that outnumbers
them by at least 200 to 1.  They will fade back into the shadows, except
for the few required to run an aggressive propaganda front on the
networks - under the close guidance of professionals, or so it appears
from the quality and volume distribution of their recent product.
I wonder if Mr. Bannon dropped out so he could work full time on that
project, without risk of premature exposure and a backlash against the
still very useful Trump Administration.  Say what you will about Steve
Bannon, he is an adversary to be proud of:  Beat him and you did
something worthwhile and not at all easy.
The sponsors of the Nazi / KKK propaganda efforts do deserve bonus
points for prompting our NeoLiberal mass media outlets to pick up and
actively promote their "free speech" talking points.  This leverages
NeoLiberal corporate directives to damage the anarchist associations
that run Antifa in any way possible - a smart move.  Turns out the Left
Loves Nazis, when it is to their advantage to do so, and nice polite
middle class racists are a largely untapped market.
You may not have mentioned the Nazi / KKK guise by name, just repeated
their principal talking points and now continue to fight for them.
Calling the causes you advocate for by their right names is a losing
move, because the terms "Nazi" and "KKK" carry 100% negative
connotations for everyone except members and committed supporters.
Pretending at NPOV also makes one sound much more rational and reasonable.
You presentation models the behavior you want your audience to emulate.
Pretending to be a neutral observer who clearly sees why the Nazi / KKK
crowd is "in the right" is much more effective than saying, "Well I side
with the organizers of Unite The Right, and the Nazis say..."
Maybe I am projecting a little:  I study propaganda, and your
presentation indicate an author or authors who also study propaganda.
When this model is "projected" over your placements, it simplifies
analysis:  Bush league amateur or top flight professional, the
techniques are the same.
Please DO show up in DC, wearing/carrying your employers' symbols of
White Nationalist Pride.  Walk right into a crowd of Juggalos and
explain to them why you are on their side and they should be on yours.
I'm sure they will be more than happy to embrace your presentation and

In part that depends on the definition of "denial."  I have not made a
special effort to evaluate the claims pro and con, but from what I have
seen it does appear that:  1)  It definitely happened, no question about
that, but 2) the numbers were significantly exaggerated, even above and
beyond Zionist propaganda counting /all/ the casualties as Jewish.
Lots of people would call that "Holocaust Denial."  It's illegal to say
say those things in Germany, last I heard.
People call Chomsky an "intellectual" so often that I have to wonder if
it's on his business card and letterhead, and the short list of branding
themes his publicist carries around.
I would be more likely to call Chomsky an "ideologue."  Every few years
Chomsky makes a cluster of widely publicized statements indicating a
rational, practical understanding of political affairs.  But that
appears to be loss leader material aimed at attracting attention,
because soon after, widely publicized straight up Party Line propaganda
follows.  Me:  "Has Chomsky gone off the reservation?" Me one week
later: "Nope, back to the same old prollfeed for self identifying Middle
Class Liberals."
So when Chomsky says that studies with a potential to disclose
information with beneficial medical applications is "of no value," he
means "of no value to my mission as a propagandist."
At one time, eugenics told us all about which "races" are morally and
intellectually better or worse than others, which gave a lovely veneer
of Scientism to the work of violent racist political factions.  In
reaction against this, the behavioral and social sciences adopted an
equally politicized position that all humans are born as blank slates
with identical potentials in every area, period, and set about proving
it to the best of their ability.  Today, this seems to have mostly
sorted itself, and genetics, the prenatal chemical environment, and the
impact of post-natal environmental imprints and conditioned responses
are all recognized as contributory factors to cognitive and behavioral
traits that vary from person to person.
Propagandists need all-encompassing talking points; their audiences
demand instant E-Z unchanging one size fits all answers and "If I don't
provide them, someone else will."  Never mind the cha-ching of the cash
register in the background, and the resulting inability of their
indoctrinated audiences to do anything but fight among themselves as
directed while their rulers make all the decisions that control their
lives and destinies.
So they sigh, shake their heads sorrowfully and say "Some problems won't
be solved in our lifetimes," and get back to work making things worse
because the mortgage doesn't pay itself.

I view systemic corruption and malfeasance as an organic process
analogous to the evolution of ecosystems adapted to local physical
conditions.  As individual organisms pursue their immediate self
interest, some adaptations are more profitable than others.  In organic
evolution, whatever forms and behaviors combine to produce the most
grandchildren win out, while those that produce the least die out.
In human social organization, adaptive behaviors create mind-sets and
"cultures" on much the same basis:  The forms and behaviors that produce
the most power for the participating individuals win out, while those
that produce the least die out.  Across institutions where thousands of
individuals participate in activities that transfer and apply money and
power, the personal benefits of breaking rules and subverting the
organization's nominal mission will always reward those who excel at
deception, theft and violence - and especially those who develop
strategies for cooperating with others to apply these winning strategies
at the expense of "outsiders".
The rest is history.  Quite literally so because history is fossilized
propaganda, written by the winners in a given generation's perverse
incentives contest.
Solutions?  My suggestion is to limit "sovereign" States to the smallest
attainable size, because popular self-governance DOES NOT SCALE.  The
larger the organization, the more hiding places and the more
irresistible the incentives for bad faith actors.  Any system of
government that grows too large and complex for an "ordinary citizen" to
see and understand what it is doing in useful detail, is a government
that will be taken over and operated by bad faith actors, working for
their own advantage at everyone else's expense.
In this context, the good and bad news are one and the same:  My
preferred forms of government are coming, and no human agency can
prevent that.  Because by century's end the collapse of the world's
industrial economies and a significant human population crash will leave
today's giant State institutions bankrupt, powerless and irrelevant.

@_subject: What is consensus? 
Re "What is consensus?" Mirmir replied "Ask any Quaker."
That's me, and I am now required (dammit) to give a straight answer
because I'm a Friend in good standing, a "made guy" so to speak.
The quote from Georgi above seems to be part of the original thread so
at least there's a context to answer the question in.
Consensus means agreement.  And that means a messy, organic, all too
human hairball at work.  The Quakers are often accused of governing
themselves by consensus, and have been so accused for something
approaching 400 years.  Here's how we do it, more or less.
The following is not the "rules of RSOF engagement," so much as my own
observation of Friends' process, developed from 20+ years of full
participation, including lots of committee work for my monthly and
yearly Meetings.  I do push the Gospel of Truth in the manner of
Friends, promoting the religious practice that makes Friends "a peculiar
people" - which, back in the day, meant a "distinct" group.
In practical application among Friends, consensus arises from local
communities, small enough that everyone is at most at one remove in
acquaintance from one another.  Friends participate, first and foremost,
in an agreement among themselves to work together in compliance with a
specified process for decision making.
When geographically dispersed Friends participate in regionally
sponsored projects (and we do, non-stop), representatives selected by
participating Meetings form committees; these committees execute the
same consensus procedure to arrive at their recommendations to the
regional body as a whole.  No decision on matters of faith and practice
or Meeting business becomes "binding" without advice and approval from
Meeting as a whole.
Quakers don't do "consensus" as that word is understood in a secular
context.  We make decisions based on "a sense of the Meeting," and we
call the process for that discernment.  Any Friend who has had Quakerism
101 understands that we are discerning the will of God, most properly so
in silence broken only by vocal ministry as so led; having found that,
the next step is to seek "way forward" toward compliance with our orders
from the head office.
Friends do present a peculiar position on God, this time in the modern
sense of the word peculiar.  Weighty Friends (made gals and guise who
may speak rarely but do command attention, for reasons) have long
agreed:  Nobody can define or describe God.  But whatever that word
stands for, we know it when we see it in motion, and accept that once
set on a path by that force, one must do /something/ regardless of
personal preferences or interests.
"Friends don't vote," but we do discriminate:  Membership in our Society
is accomplished by a consensus between oneself and the local Meeting's
membership at large - there's a formal process for that, and new or
transferred members are recorded or "minuted" as such by the clerk of
their Meeting.  Roles such as Clerk of Meeting, Trustees, etc. will
nearly always be filled by members of Meeting, as will committees that
engage in pastoral counseling where confidentiality issues may arise.
All other committees are wide open for any member or attender to sit in
Friends normally meet weekly for meeting for worship, and monthly for
"meeting for worship with a concern for business," which is open to all.
   Committees report to the latter meeting on a monthly basis, but
otherwise work where and as expedient.
It can take Friends half of forever to get anything outside of
established routine done, but what we do sticks.  Conversely, when a
situation requires it Friends form and operate voluntary organizations
in near real-time.  Friends' Service Committees have crossed active
battlefields in caravans carrying relief supplies to besieged civilians,
literally using their religious authority and single-minded commitment
as their only shield and weapon.
Friends enjoy a certain notoriety for tolerance, but not the usual kind
where someone is "tolerated" for the sake of appearance or process
compliance:  Every "sinner" is welcome, and as living proof one could
point to several committed atheists who rate as 'weighty' Friends in the
Disclaimer II:  The above is presented as a resource for anarchists and
other loose ends looking to mine historical and (in effect) covert
examples of social organization for background, and any components that
can be usefully recycled.  No warranty of fitness for use for any
purpose is expressed or implied.
Especially beware, the real life Religious Society of Friends lives up
to the bare bones description above "on a good day".  In addition to
routine errors routinely corrected, on occasion a Meeting or responsible
Committee may go off-track and require correction from the floor, so to
speak.  I am not supposed to know that a Meeting may occasionally "lose
its minutes" covering periods of time when scandalous events were afoot,
and neither are you.
We get a lot of lookey-loos, typically people who see the RSOF as an
elite family-friendly social club for liberal academics and
professionals.  Some of them even settle in and convert, to the full
extent they are so led.
BTW, Quakers are "Friends of Jesus" [John 15:14-16] first and foremost,
and friends of each other by virtue of that relationship.
Thus ends St. Erroneous' Epistle to the Cypherpunks.

@_subject: What is consensus? 
Back in the day Friends were one of many radical social movements that
appeared in response to the early development of the Industrial Age and
the first appearance of a "middle class."  These movements were shaped
in large part by the rapid spread of literacy and availability of books,
including bibles which common people could read and interpret for
themselves for the first time.  The Partition Act and other radical
social/economic changes in England and Europe during the 1600s turned
the world upside down - the origin of the word "revolution" - and the
stage was set for interesting times.
The Ranters, Diggers, Levellers, and many other factions are long gone,
but the Mennonites, Amish, Unitarians and Quakers remain with us today.
One thing all these movements had in common was their rejection of
Church and State authority, in preference for what would today be called
"human rights" and religious freedom.  All met and most survived violent
persecution by State authorities.
Early Friends called the Roman and Post-Roman churches the apostasy, in
reference to their self evident abandonment of the Christian teachings
of their own Bible in favor of collusion with State authority and the
financial interests of "hireling ministers."  Along with the other
groups mentioned above, Friends were religiously motivated anarchists
owing no spiritual /or/ material allegiance to any established
institution.  These groups developed institutions of their own, some
more anarchistic than others but all grounded in radical egalitarianism,
voluntary membership, and adherence to community standards developed by
the communities themselves.
In England the Friends existed in substantial numbers, and caused so
much trouble that William Penn, advocating on their behalf, was able to
obtain a Crown Charter for a colony in the New World expressly as a
dumping ground for English Quakers.  More than enough were eager to get
out from under Crown authority to quickly populate Pennsylvania with
The Quakers considered the Native Americans as human as themselves, and
saw a clear reflection of their own methods of self-governance in the
tribal councils and federations process.  The Friends paid for the land
they took and engaged in normal commerce with the locals.  As a result,
Friends came to be known as "the honest white men" and still enjoy a
unique reputation among native communities.
Friends were among the earliest and most stubborn of pacifist
organizations, refusing to bear arms.  They also openly refused to use
the language and mannerisms of master and servant, hard wired into
English culture, and for this many were jailed, tortured and/or killed.
Their adamant rejection of merely human authority, in preference for
local self rule on a model often /mistaken/ for consensus by outsiders,
completes the picture of the most viable anarchist movement to emerge
from the Age of Enlightenment.
It's been a long, winding road since then with plenty of forks and dead
ends.  Our numbers have collapsed, in the U.S. midwest a conventional
"protestant" sect has co-opted our Society's name, but Friends are still
here:  A pale shadow of the Society's former self, banging along on two
or three cylinders but still capable of exercising social and political
influence /far/ beyond what our numbers would suggest.
We rarely advertise and never lay a high pressure sales pitch on anyone.
 Sociologists studying religious beliefs and attitudes in the U.S. find
that conventional churches have been largely abandoned by people who
want, ironically enough, exactly what the Religious Society of Friends
has to offer... but they don't know we exist.

Early Friends were opposed to recreational drugs of any kind.  But in
modern times, I have attended "meeting for drinking with a concern for
business" and nobody noticed it was funny until I pointed that out.  Ya
see, the local Meeting's outreach committee reserved a table for a
meeting at a restaurant, but the table was not ready when we showed up
so we were seated at the bar.  Lucky me, they had Rolling Rock in stock.
Friends have always had their say on social and political issues.
George Fox sailed to the West Indies to preach against the evils of
slavery, and John Woolman is credited as one of the first major American
Quakers, Mennonites and their ilk who refused to serve in World War II
were sent to prison with black radicals who also refused to serve
(history seems to have forgotten them), and the resulting cross
fertilization of ideas and methods help shape the later Civil Rights
movement we are told so many pretty lies about today, starting with the
one about how it succeeded and is over and done with.  Every town of any
size named a street after MLK Jr., what more do "those people" want?!
During the Vietnam War, thousands of draftees who knew the score refused
to serve and were /not/ jailed, thanks to laws lobbied for by Quakers
and etc., and help from draft counselors who themselves were mostly
Quakers.  I seem to recall that /five/ people who had assistance from
NIBSCO were successfully prosecuted as draft dodgers during that war;
the rest just sat out the war in the U.S., living their otherwise normal
lives.  I got my NIBSCO / CCW Draft Counselor training back during the
Bush II Administration, when it looked possible that the draft might get
started back up.
Richard Nixon was a "birthright Friend" but that means nothing unless
one also becomes a "convinced Friend," which he most emphatically did
not.  Joan Baez is still a Friend, although she never talks about that
in public because she doesn't want to disrupt her Meeting.
Any time one sees Friends misidentified as "Protestant" check to see
what part of the world the "Quakers" in question came from.  If the
American Midwest (and today, sub-Saharan Africa), they are not what
George Fox would have called Friends:  Long story short, Protestants
managed to co-opt the Quaker name and some of its outward appearances
during the first big western expansion into the Ohio River Valley and
etc.  They managed this by virtue of massively outnumbering the Friends
who went west and built the first schools, which were also the first
Meeting Houses (and later, so-called Quaker "churches") in the new farm
towns on what was then the Western Frontier.
The descendants of these congregations are now called "Conservative
Friends," and yes they are Protestants - complete with hireling
ministers, programmed religious services, right-wing political
commitments, gender discrimination written into their policy docs, and
etc.  As individuals most are very nice people, I prefer their company
to any other Protestant denomination I can name.  But as an organization
it's fatally flawed, and many Yearly Meetings in the U.S. have formally
disaffiliated themselves from the "Conservative" national body, Friends
United Meeting.
Just now my own Yearly Meeting is supporting efforts to educate the
African congregations started by FUM "Protestant Quaker" missionaries,
on the actual history and religious practice of Friends.  Reports from
the field indicate very enthusiastic uptake, perhaps in large part
because the typical problems in African social politics and Protestant
social politics are a good match and potentate each other, reliably
creating worst case outcomes. What I call "real" Quaker practice
provides cognitive and organizational tools that can be applied to
attack and solve those problems... "on a good day, all else being equal."

The grunt in question would most likely be a thing made of meat that
always and only does exactly what its owners have programmed it to do.
Holding it accountable for following its orders, as if it was capable of
independent motivation and judgment, only makes sense in one context:
As an act of propaganda aimed at conditioning the obedience of /other/
things made of meat that always and only do exactly what their owners
have programmed them to do.
Human-like things that have been programmed to loudly express
unconditional hatred when confronted with any appearance or exercise of
State and Corporate "authority" serve their State and Corporate masters
with blind devotion.  The fulfill their assigned civic duty by
discrediting /all/ objections to exercises of State and Corporate
authority as ignorant and irrational, and by physically obstructing
attempts to organize any effective push-back against same.
Reflexive obedience vs. reflexive disobedience presents an example of
the "let's you and him fight" strategy, where whole national populations
are manipulated into identifying each other as enemies.  This process
neutralizes the potential political power of whole populations.  Result:
 Their rulers are free to do whatever, whenever - and to call that
"democratic self rule."

I view systemic corruption and malfeasance as an organic process
analogous to the evolution of ecosystems adapted to local physical
conditions.  As individual organisms pursue their immediate self
interest, some adaptations are more profitable than others.  In organic
evolution, whatever forms and behaviors combine to produce the most
grandchildren win out, while those that produce the least die out.
In human social organization, adaptive behaviors create mind-sets and
"cultures" on much the same basis:  The forms and behaviors that produce
the most power for the participating individuals win out, while those
that produce the least die out.  Across institutions where thousands of
individuals participate in activities that transfer and apply money and
power, the personal benefits of breaking rules and subverting the
organization's nominal mission will always reward those who excel at
deception, theft and violence - and especially those who develop
strategies for cooperating with others to apply these winning strategies
at the expense of "outsiders".
The rest is history.  Quite literally so because history is fossilized
propaganda, written by the winners in a given generation's perverse
incentives contest.
Solutions?  My suggestion is to limit "sovereign" States to the smallest
attainable size, because popular self-governance DOES NOT SCALE.  The
larger the organization, the more hiding places and the more
irresistible the incentives for bad faith actors.  Any system of
government that grows too large and complex for an "ordinary citizen" to
see and understand what it is doing in useful detail, is a government
that will be taken over and operated by bad faith actors, working for
their own advantage at everyone else's expense.
In this context, the good and bad news are one and the same:  My
preferred forms of government are coming, and no human agency can
prevent that.  Because by century's end the collapse of the world's
industrial economies and a significant human population crash will leave
today's giant State institutions bankrupt, powerless and irrelevant.

@_subject: What is consensus? 
Re "What is consensus?" Mirmir replied "Ask any Quaker."
That's me, and I am now required (dammit) to give a straight answer
because I'm a Friend in good standing, a "made guy" so to speak.
The quote from Georgi above seems to be part of the original thread so
at least there's a context to answer the question in.
Consensus means agreement.  And that means a messy, organic, all too
human hairball at work.  The Quakers are often accused of governing
themselves by consensus, and have been so accused for something
approaching 400 years.  Here's how we do it, more or less.
The following is not the "rules of RSOF engagement," so much as my own
observation of Friends' process, developed from 20+ years of full
participation, including lots of committee work for my monthly and
yearly Meetings.  I do push the Gospel of Truth in the manner of
Friends, promoting the religious practice that makes Friends "a peculiar
people" - which, back in the day, meant a "distinct" group.
In practical application among Friends, consensus arises from local
communities, small enough that everyone is at most at one remove in
acquaintance from one another.  Friends participate, first and foremost,
in an agreement among themselves to work together in compliance with a
specified process for decision making.
When geographically dispersed Friends participate in regionally
sponsored projects (and we do, non-stop), representatives selected by
participating Meetings form committees; these committees execute the
same consensus procedure to arrive at their recommendations to the
regional body as a whole.  No decision on matters of faith and practice
or Meeting business becomes "binding" without advice and approval from
Meeting as a whole.
Quakers don't do "consensus" as that word is understood in a secular
context.  We make decisions based on "a sense of the Meeting," and we
call the process for that discernment.  Any Friend who has had Quakerism
101 understands that we are discerning the will of God, most properly so
in silence broken only by vocal ministry as so led; having found that,
the next step is to seek "way forward" toward compliance with our orders
from the head office.
Friends do present a peculiar position on God, this time in the modern
sense of the word peculiar.  Weighty Friends (made gals and guise who
may speak rarely but do command attention, for reasons) have long
agreed:  Nobody can define or describe God.  But whatever that word
stands for, we know it when we see it in motion, and accept that once
set on a path by that force, one must do /something/ regardless of
personal preferences or interests.
"Friends don't vote," but we do discriminate:  Membership in our Society
is accomplished by a consensus between oneself and the local Meeting's
membership at large - there's a formal process for that, and new or
transferred members are recorded or "minuted" as such by the clerk of
their Meeting.  Roles such as Clerk of Meeting, Trustees, etc. will
nearly always be filled by members of Meeting, as will committees that
engage in pastoral counseling where confidentiality issues may arise.
All other committees are wide open for any member or attender to sit in
Friends normally meet weekly for meeting for worship, and monthly for
"meeting for worship with a concern for business," which is open to all.
   Committees report to the latter meeting on a monthly basis, but
otherwise work where and as expedient.
It can take Friends half of forever to get anything outside of
established routine done, but what we do sticks.  Conversely, when a
situation requires it Friends form and operate voluntary organizations
in near real-time.  Friends' Service Committees have crossed active
battlefields in caravans carrying relief supplies to besieged civilians,
literally using their religious authority and single-minded commitment
as their only shield and weapon.
Friends enjoy a certain notoriety for tolerance, but not the usual kind
where someone is "tolerated" for the sake of appearance or process
compliance:  Every "sinner" is welcome, and as living proof one could
point to several committed atheists who rate as 'weighty' Friends in the
Disclaimer II:  The above is presented as a resource for anarchists and
other loose ends looking to mine historical and (in effect) covert
examples of social organization for background, and any components that
can be usefully recycled.  No warranty of fitness for use for any
purpose is expressed or implied.
Especially beware, the real life Religious Society of Friends lives up
to the bare bones description above "on a good day".  In addition to
routine errors routinely corrected, on occasion a Meeting or responsible
Committee may go off-track and require correction from the floor, so to
speak.  I am not supposed to know that a Meeting may occasionally "lose
its minutes" covering periods of time when scandalous events were afoot,
and neither are you.
We get a lot of lookey-loos, typically people who see the RSOF as an
elite family-friendly social club for liberal academics and
professionals.  Some of them even settle in and convert, to the full
extent they are so led.
BTW, Quakers are "Friends of Jesus" [John 15:14-16] first and foremost,
and friends of each other by virtue of that relationship.
Thus ends St. Erroneous' Epistle to the Cypherpunks.
I leave you with this prophesy:  Many things shall come to pass, yea
verily shall many things come to pass.

@_subject: What is consensus? 
Back in the day Friends were one of many radical social movements that
appeared in response to the early development of the Industrial Age and
the first appearance of a "middle class."  These movements were shaped
in large part by the rapid spread of literacy and availability of books,
including bibles which common people could read and interpret for
themselves for the first time.  The Partition Act and other radical
social/economic changes in England and Europe during the 1600s turned
the world upside down - the origin of the word "revolution" - and the
stage was set for interesting times.
The Ranters, Diggers, Levellers, and many other factions are long gone,
but the Mennonites, Amish, Unitarians and Quakers remain with us today.
One thing all these movements had in common was their rejection of
Church and State authority, in preference for what would today be called
"human rights" and religious freedom.  All met and most survived violent
persecution by State authorities.
Early Friends called the Roman and Post-Roman churches the apostasy, in
reference to their self evident abandonment of the Christian teachings
of their own Bible in favor of collusion with State authority and the
financial interests of "hireling ministers."  Along with the other
groups mentioned above, Friends were religiously motivated anarchists
owing no spiritual /or/ material allegiance to any established
institution.  These groups developed institutions of their own, some
more anarchistic than others but all grounded in radical egalitarianism,
voluntary membership, and adherence to community standards developed by
the communities themselves.
In England the Friends existed in substantial numbers, and caused so
much trouble that William Penn, advocating on their behalf, was able to
obtain a Crown Charter for a colony in the New World expressly as a
dumping ground for English Quakers.  More than enough were eager to get
out from under Crown authority to quickly populate Pennsylvania with
The Quakers considered the Native Americans as human as themselves, and
saw a clear reflection of their own methods of self-governance in the
tribal councils and federations process.  The Friends paid for the land
they took and engaged in normal commerce with the locals.  As a result,
Friends came to be known as "the honest white men" and still enjoy a
unique reputation among native communities.
Friends were among the earliest and most stubborn of pacifist
organizations, refusing to bear arms.  They also openly refused to use
the language and mannerisms of master and servant, hard wired into
English culture, and for this many were jailed, tortured and/or killed.
Their adamant rejection of merely human authority, in preference for
local self rule on a model often /mistaken/ for consensus by outsiders,
completes the picture of the most viable anarchist movement to emerge
from the Age of Enlightenment.
It's been a long, winding road since then with plenty of forks and dead
ends.  Our numbers have collapsed, in the U.S. midwest a conventional
"protestant" sect has co-opted our Society's name, but Friends are still
here:  A pale shadow of the Society's former self, banging along on two
or three cylinders but still capable of exercising social and political
influence /far/ beyond what our numbers would suggest.
We rarely advertise and never lay a high pressure sales pitch on anyone.
 Sociologists studying religious beliefs and attitudes in the U.S. find
that conventional churches have been largely abandoned by people who
want, ironically enough, exactly what the Religious Society of Friends
has to offer... but they don't know we exist.

Early Friends were opposed to recreational drugs of any kind.  But in
modern times, I have attended "meeting for drinking with a concern for
business" and nobody noticed it was funny until I pointed that out.  Ya
see, the local Meeting's outreach committee reserved a table for a
meeting at a restaurant, but the table was not ready when we showed up
so we were seated at the bar.  Lucky me, they had Rolling Rock in stock.
Friends have always had their say on social and political issues.
George Fox sailed to the West Indies to preach against the evils of
slavery, and John Woolman is credited as one of the first major American
Quakers, Mennonites and their ilk who refused to serve in World War II
were sent to prison with black radicals who also refused to serve
(history seems to have forgotten them), and the resulting cross
fertilization of ideas and methods help shape the later Civil Rights
movement we are told so many pretty lies about today, starting with the
one about how it succeeded and is over and done with.  Every town of any
size named a street after MLK Jr., what more do "those people" want?!
During the Vietnam War, thousands of draftees who knew the score refused
to serve and were /not/ jailed, thanks to laws lobbied for by Quakers
and etc., and help from draft counselors who themselves were mostly
Quakers.  I seem to recall that /five/ people who had assistance from
NIBSCO were successfully prosecuted as draft dodgers during that war;
the rest just sat out the war in the U.S., living their otherwise normal
lives.  I got my NIBSCO / CCW Draft Counselor training back during the
Bush II Administration, when it looked possible that the draft might get
started back up.
Richard Nixon was a "birthright Friend" but that means nothing unless
one also becomes a "convinced Friend," which he most emphatically did
not.  Joan Baez is still a Friend, although she never talks about that
in public because she doesn't want to disrupt her Meeting.
Any time one sees Friends misidentified as "Protestant" check to see
what part of the world the "Quakers" in question came from.  If the
American Midwest (and today, sub-Saharan Africa), they are not what
George Fox would have called Friends:  Long story short, Protestants
managed to co-opt the Quaker name and some of its outward appearances
during the first big western expansion into the Ohio River Valley and
etc.  They managed this by virtue of massively outnumbering the Friends
who went west and built the first schools, which were also the first
Meeting Houses (and later, so-called Quaker "churches") in the new farm
towns on what was then the Western Frontier.
The descendants of these congregations are now called "Conservative
Friends," and yes they are Protestants - complete with hireling
ministers, programmed religious services, right-wing political
commitments, gender discrimination written into their policy docs, and
etc.  As individuals most are very nice people, I prefer their company
to any other Protestant denomination I can name.  But as an organization
it's fatally flawed, and many Yearly Meetings in the U.S. have formally
disaffiliated themselves from the "Conservative" national body, Friends
United Meeting.
Just now my own Yearly Meeting is supporting efforts to educate the
African congregations started by FUM "Protestant Quaker" missionaries,
on the actual history and religious practice of Friends.  Reports from
the field indicate very enthusiastic uptake, perhaps in large part
because the typical problems in African social politics and Protestant
social politics are a good match and potentate each other, reliably
creating worst case outcomes. What I call "real" Quaker practice
provides cognitive and organizational tools that can be applied to
attack and solve those problems... "on a good day, all else being equal."

My preferred definition of fascism describes it as rule by a wealthy
oligarchy composed of industrialists and financiers, a.k.a.
capitalists, under a veneer of pretended "democracy."
On the domestic front, fascist States consolidate and expand the power
of a ruling elite through a propaganda regimen presenting an
existential conflict between the country's racial and ethnic "rightful
owners" and selected racial, ethnic and foreign scapegoats.
On the international front, fascist States wage aggressive wars to
further the commercial interests of their ruling elites, under the
pretext of national self defense against notional existential threats
to the State's racial and ethnic "rightful owners."
Today, I view U.S. Progressive Liberal and Conservative Right
constituencies as products of marketing campaigns respectively
promoting covert and overt, or soft and hard, fascist values and
agendas to the public.  I view the political conflict between the
nominal Left and Right at the national policy level as a friendly
competition between financiers (Left) and industrialists (Right) for
dominance in setting national policy for their own benefit.

TOR SECURITY ISSUE - Posted September 6, 2013: The TOR Network is
apparently under attack from a large scale actor who presently owns
3/4 of the client nodes in the TOR network. Until proven otherwise -
or the attack stops - it must be assumed that a major State actor

@_subject: Hypernormalisation 
Hash: SHA1
I recently watched Adam Curtis' latest documentary,
Hypernormalisation.  Being a long time fan of Curtis' work, I found
Hypernormalisation a little disconcerting.  Mainstream historians
often do very well at exposing the "important but neglected" details
of once-controversial political events.  But when their accounts
directly involve living persons in positions of power their standards
of evidence may take a holiday.  As an example, Overthrow:  America's
Century Of Regine Change by Stephen Kinzer stands out as a remarkably
complete and insightful work until it arrives at the first Bush
Administration.  From there, the author begins repeating the U.S.
propaganda line contradicting well documented, readily available
factual evidence.  It now appears that Adam Curtis has also found a
need to exercise discretion in truth-telling.
I may change my mind tomorrow.  Maybe there's something ironic or
Mobius-self-referential behind the narrative of Hypernormalisation
that I just don't get.  But right now I question the wisdom of Curtis
even starting this project, which accepts current propaganda
narratives, rejected by a consensus of independent journalists, as
plain facts.  This is largely accomplished by dancing around the
ground truth of key turning point events central to the narrative's
accounts of the present wars in Libya and Syria.
In a film whose message might be summed up as "civilization has gone
insane and no one knows what is real any more," gross misattribution
of the origins of the wars against Libya and Syria casts a long
shadow:  Had more factual views of the role of US/NATO powers in these
events been acknowledged, however briefly, that shadow would not be
quite so dark:  But as the presentation stands, it proves its own
point by hiding information essential to understanding reality,
depriving the audience of insights with regard to fact vs. fiction on
the world stage - a definition of insanity.
I don't expect Mr. Curtis to be a superhero or a martyr.  But I have
come to expect better work than Hypernormalisation from him.  Parts of
the show were really quite excellent.  But the more he built on the
central themes of the presentation, the more disjointed and dissonant
the narrative looked to me, until Curtis appeared to prove his own
point about the world going insane as the narrative itself went off
the rails and broke contact with reality.  I do not expect a Call To
Action at the end of a Curtis story, but an implicit statement that
our only option is to "just give up," reinforced by an object lesson
in same, is a call to action of its own sort.
I appreciate and recommend the whole Curtis canon of documentaries,
and my expectations for the future are not diminished:  I can easily
believe that in this case, the material Curtis was working with bit
back and he did the best he could to salvage a no-win situation.  So I
do suggest that readers who are not familiar with Adam Curtis check
out The Power Of Nightmares and/or The Century Of The Self before
viewing Hypernormalisation.

redundant content and long stretches of stock footage that "fit in"

me this suggests that a LOT of content may have landed on the cutting

Greewald's timing was exact and deliberate:  He reportedly fought with

all the way out of the news.
Snowden's service record as reported never made sense to me, either.
Pencil neck geeks rarely volunteer for Special Forces, are never taken

I didn't catch that one.  Hmm...
The whole business about how Journalists have some elevated, priestly

out as bizarre.  Journalists are a priestly caste, so let's hand a
zillion or so classified documents to an attorney who rose to
celebrity status as a political commentator?  Yeah right...
Not mentioned in the film, Mr. Greenwald's $250 million payout when he
sold rights to the documents he reportedly promised Snowden would all
be released to the public within ten days of breaking the first story.
To date, every result of the Snowden Saga has been beneficial to the
Security State.  The State has won every legal challenge resulting
from those releases, establishing its "right" to collect everything on
everyone, restrained only by its own technical capabilities.  As a
bonus, it has been established that the DCI can lie to Congress and
break into Congress members' computers with NO consequences of ANY
kind.  The great unwashed publick, already timid enough, is now on
notice that Big Brother is in fact watching them.
The Snowden Saga looked hinky to me from the beginning.  My own guess
is that he was/is an unwitting agent, a malleable malcontent spotted
early by an Insider Threat program and picked from a field of
candidates to front for a limited hangout aimed at achieving all the

Part of "fighting the Internet" and dealing with damaging leaks is to

Hash: SHA1
I think that depends on the performance of the anonymous networking
tool in question.  Generally speaking, higher speed and capacity
equates to lower security.  High bandwidth, low latency connected
protocols present the worst case scenario; low bandwidth, high latency
unconnected protocols present the best case scenario.
As an example, providing "normal" http performance on an anonymous
overlay network (the TOR scenario) presents a huge attack surface.  An
adversary who can observe the majority of the physical network
infrastructure all at once can use traffic analysis to trace
connections from end to end; a lesser adversary could stand up enough
routing nodes to be the majority owner of the overlay network and both
passively observe and actively manipulate traffic to achieve the same
goals as a global observer at a tiny fraction of the cost. (VPN
connections from a cloud server farm to numerous remote hosts solves
the problem of running centrally controlling nodes that /appear/ to be
independently operated.)
At the opposite end of the scale, imagine a network of NNTP servers
that carry only PKI encrypted posts, distributing everything posted to
all users.  The users' local installations would try their owner's
keys against /all/ the messages, writing those that decrypt to an
inbox folder.  Here, traffic analysis and/or majority ownership of
nodes would be more or less useless; one good attack would be to
overwhelm the network with flood of bogus message traffic.
Countermeasures to this attack could include a web of trust
arrangement, and configuring the nodes to only store and forward
messages signed by "trusted" users; at least this would force an
adversary to do some work to flood the network with garbage.
I believe it is reasonable to expect better anonymity to /always/
involve performance hits in latency, bandwidth, and local resource
usage, relative to "normal" routing protocols.
In practical terms, today's anonymizing technology /probably/ imposes
sufficient delays on the identification of users and who is talking to
whom that physical anonymity - i.e. making only brief connections to
open wireless routers at locations where one is not seen coming and
going - should provide "really good" anonymity.  Of course one must
prevent the hardware from leaking identifiers via RF or TCP/IP vectors.
Conversely, repeatedly using anonymizing network protocols from one
location provides cover against low powered adversaries, while top
tier adversaries who by definition will know "who you are and who you
communicate with" may be restrained from hostile action by their
reluctance to disclose the existence of "sensitive sources and
methods."  That is, until or unless they find your activities /really/
annoying, and spend a little money / take a little risk setting you up
for a series of unfortunate events that won't be attributed to them.

1)  Expose the Conspiracy by promoting the Alex Jones message.
2)  Arm yourself and prepare to kill the Evil People.

plus private sector advisors and lobbyists, has its own hard wired
agendas and institutional inertia.  It is called the Deep State.
The comparatively tiny handful of elected officials who are somewhat

apparently under attack from a large scale actor who presently owns
3/4 of the client nodes in the TOR network. Until proven otherwise -
or the attack stops - it must be assumed that a major State actor

Is the missing page a result of a random error by a person working in
a toxic, abusive corporate environment? Very possibly. Public

individuls inside the TOR Project, paint a picture of gross
malfeasance in personnel management and vicious personal vendettas run
rampant: See The Crucifixion of IOError for an introduction to the can

historical information relevant to the security and otherwise of the
Onion Routing network could also be something worse: An attempt to
remove data necessary to accurately estimate the Onion Routing
network's baseline security. Any way I look at it, I come to the same
conclusion: It's time to downgrade estimates of the security provided
by TOR - again.

Even if one makes the most pessimistic assumptions, TOR remains
useful. It will continue to punch through school, corporate and even
national network firewalls. TOR negates surveillance by network
service providers and makes users effectively invisible to
surveillance and profiling by corporate actors. TOR will continue to
reliably protect wireless connections at public venues from
eavesdropping or manipulation by J. Random Hacker. But TOR users who
have reason to believe that the NSA or another State actor would ever

@_subject: Hypernormalisation 
Hash: SHA1
I recently watched Adam Curtis' latest documentary,
Hypernormalisation.  Being a long time fan of Curtis' work, I found
Hypernormalisation a little disconcerting.  Mainstream historians
often do very well at exposing the "important but neglected" details
of once-controversial political events.  But when their accounts
directly involve living persons in positions of power their standards
of evidence may take a holiday.  As an example, Overthrow:  America's
Century Of Regine Change by Stephen Kinzer stands out as a remarkably
complete and insightful work until it arrives at the first Bush
Administration.  From there, the author begins repeating the U.S.
propaganda line contradicting well documented, readily available
factual evidence.  It now appears that Adam Curtis has also found a
need to exercise discretion in truth-telling.
I may change my mind tomorrow.  Maybe there's something ironic or
Mobius-self-referential behind the narrative of Hypernormalisation
that I just don't get.  But right now I question the wisdom of Curtis
even starting this project, which accepts current propaganda
narratives, rejected by a consensus of independent journalists, as
plain facts.  This is largely accomplished by dancing around the
ground truth of key turning point events central to the narrative's
accounts of the present wars in Libya and Syria.
In a film whose message might be summed up as "civilization has gone
insane and no one knows what is real any more," gross misattribution
of the origins of the wars against Libya and Syria casts a long
shadow:  Had more factual views of the role of US/NATO powers in these
events been acknowledged, however briefly, that shadow would not be
quite so dark:  But as the presentation stands, it proves its own
point by hiding information essential to understanding reality,
depriving the audience of insights with regard to fact vs. fiction on
the world stage - a definition of insanity.
I don't expect Mr. Curtis to be a superhero or a martyr.  But I have
come to expect better work than Hypernormalisation from him.  Parts of
the show were really quite excellent.  But the more he built on the
central themes of the presentation, the more disjointed and dissonant
the narrative looked to me, until Curtis appeared to prove his own
point about the world going insane as the narrative itself went off
the rails and broke contact with reality.  I do not expect a Call To
Action at the end of a Curtis story, but an implicit statement that
our only option is to "just give up," reinforced by an object lesson
in same, is a call to action of its own sort.
I appreciate and recommend the whole Curtis canon of documentaries,
and my expectations for the future are not diminished:  I can easily
believe that in this case, the material Curtis was working with bit
back and he did the best he could to salvage a no-win situation.  So I
do suggest that readers who are not familiar with Adam Curtis check
out The Power Of Nightmares and/or The Century Of The Self before
viewing Hypernormalisation.

redundant content and long stretches of stock footage that "fit in"
but do not contribute to the narrative.  This is not at all typical of
Curtis' work - as far as I know it's unique to this presentation.  To
me this suggests that a LOT of content may have landed on the cutting
room floor after review by the BBC.

Greewald's timing was exact and deliberate:  He reportedly fought with
his editors to get the publication date of the PRISM slides pushed up
to the opening day of Manning's court martial.  This knocked Manning
all the way out of the news.
Snowden's service record as reported never made sense to me, either.
Pencil neck geeks rarely volunteer for Special Forces, are never taken
when they do, and none of that happens during basic training.
I didn't catch that one.  Hmm...
The whole business about how Journalists have some elevated, priestly
status, running through Snowden's narrative non-stop, always sticks
out as bizarre.  Journalists are a priestly caste, so let's hand a
zillion or so classified documents to an attorney who rose to
celebrity status as a political commentator?  Yeah right...
Not mentioned in the film, Mr. Greenwald's $250 million payout when he
sold rights to the documents he reportedly promised Snowden would all
be released to the public within ten days of breaking the first story.
To date, every result of the Snowden Saga has been beneficial to the
Security State.  The State has won every legal challenge resulting
from those releases, establishing its "right" to collect everything on
everyone, restrained only by its own technical capabilities.  As a
bonus, it has been established that the DCI can lie to Congress and
break into Congress members' computers with NO consequences of ANY
kind.  The great unwashed publick, already timid enough, is now on
notice that Big Brother is in fact watching them.
The Snowden Saga looked hinky to me from the beginning.  My own guess
is that he was/is an unwitting agent, a malleable malcontent spotted
early by an Insider Threat program and picked from a field of
candidates to front for a limited hangout aimed at achieving all the
goals outlined above.
Part of "fighting the Internet" and dealing with damaging leaks is to
get out in front with your own narrative and dominate the market for

@_subject: Building a new Tor that can resist next-generation state 
Hash: SHA1
I think that depends on the performance of the anonymous networking
tool in question.  Generally speaking, higher speed and capacity
equates to lower security.  High bandwidth, low latency connected
protocols present the worst case scenario; low bandwidth, high latency
unconnected protocols present the best case scenario.
As an example, providing "normal" http performance on an anonymous
overlay network (the TOR scenario) presents a huge attack surface.  An
adversary who can observe the majority of the physical network
infrastructure all at once can use traffic analysis to trace
connections from end to end; a lesser adversary could stand up enough
routing nodes to be the majority owner of the overlay network and both
passively observe and actively manipulate traffic to achieve the same
goals as a global observer at a tiny fraction of the cost. (VPN
connections from a cloud server farm to numerous remote hosts solves
the problem of running centrally controlling nodes that /appear/ to be
independently operated.)
At the opposite end of the scale, imagine a network of NNTP servers
that carry only PKI encrypted posts, distributing everything posted to
all users.  The users' local installations would try their owner's
keys against /all/ the messages, writing those that decrypt to an
inbox folder.  Here, traffic analysis and/or majority ownership of
nodes would be more or less useless; one good attack would be to
overwhelm the network with flood of bogus message traffic.
Countermeasures to this attack could include a web of trust
arrangement, and configuring the nodes to only store and forward
messages signed by "trusted" users; at least this would force an
adversary to do some work to flood the network with garbage.
I believe it is reasonable to expect better anonymity to /always/
involve performance hits in latency, bandwidth, and local resource
usage, relative to "normal" routing protocols.
In practical terms, today's anonymizing technology /probably/ imposes
sufficient delays on the identification of users and who is talking to
whom that physical anonymity - i.e. making only brief connections to
open wireless routers at locations where one is not seen coming and
going - should provide "really good" anonymity.  Of course one must
prevent the hardware from leaking identifiers via RF or TCP/IP vectors.
Conversely, repeatedly using anonymizing network protocols from one
location provides cover against low powered adversaries, while top
tier adversaries who by definition will know "who you are and who you
communicate with" may be restrained from hostile action by their
reluctance to disclose the existence of "sensitive sources and
methods."  That is, until or unless they find your activities /really/
annoying, and spend a little money / take a little risk setting you up
for a series of unfortunate events that won't be attributed to them.

I think Uncle Alex serves a larger purpose as well:  Any controversial
topic he picks up gets sprayed with Jones-brand bullshit and force-fit

sponsors like Alex, an under-reported story - delusional evidence
based - doesn't need enemies.  I call this "staining" - making a story
sound literally insane to assure that only the most credulous True
Believers will take it seriously.
I am confident that at least some propagandists employed by major
media outlets agree with this assessment; otherwise, why does Uncle
Alex get so many free promotional placements on national TV networks?
But wait, there's more:  Not only does Alex know what is /really/
wrong with the world, he knows how to fix the world, and consistently
instructs his audience to follow a two step plan.
1)  Expose the Conspiracy by promoting the Alex Jones message.
2)  Arm yourself and prepare to kill the Evil People.
That's it.  Since all the world's problems were deliberately created
by a global Conspiracy to both enslave and exterminate everyone else,
killing the Conspirators and their puppets in political office will
automatically solve all the world's problems.  Don't laugh - the
Sturmabteilung and other terrorist militias have been recruited by the
same basic pitch.
Does this make Uncle Alex look like a dedicated, hard working servant

Jones proud of him appear to tend to confirm this assessment?  Nah,

I Predict:
* More conflict between U.S. State power and "civil society" groups.
Now that the DNC can safely "point fingers" at joint DemoPublican
policies that are offensive to Liberals, a big well funded push for
"protest rally" level actions will happen.  Radical factions will use
these events as recruiting venues and may often succeed in co-opting
the message.
* A paradigm shift from Protest to Direct Action in populist politics.
Example:  Last year's rapid assembly of a larger than battalion
strength force of veterans in defense of the Standing Rock action:
The Home Team wants that to be a watershed event setting a big
precedent, the Other Guys want it to be a one-off fluke which will not
be seen again.  I think the resulting war for hearts, minds, wallets
and feet will present something Our Side can work with.
* New alliances between formerly Left and Right activists.
As shit continues to get more real on a week to week basis, a lot of
people who "thought they were" Liberal or Conservative because they
identified with emotional appeals wired into one or the other flavor
of propaganda will start to actually think about politics for the
first time.  Not many will go rogue, but those who do will be
disproportionately influential.
* NeoLiberal billionaires will wage covert wars on U.S. soil.
This is pure crystal ball stuff, don't ask me to explain why:  When I
load my current "war map" of the world in my imagination and run it, I
see private armies at work all over the U.S.  Their principal targets
will be economic and political.  Deniability will be their watchword,
exposure their Achilles' heel.
* No net gain or loss on the network privacy/security front.
Real progress on technical fronts will be counter balanced by growing
popular demand for fully automatic security, hidden behind a seamless
User Experience design paradigm.  Don't bother telling folks that

@_subject: Schneier on Russian Hacking - deconstructed 
To date I have seen many assertions, but nothing resembling evidence, in
support of the allegation that Russia "hacked" the DNC and released
damaging (but never disclaimed) DNC documents in an effort to influence
the Presidential election.
I believe the Bruce must have meant to say something to the effect that
"The constellation of evidence attributing the attacks against the DNC,
if any, has not been disclosed to the public."
Or was he asserting that he has been read into the programs that
developed this evidence, and shown relevant documentation?
Excuse me?  Obama decided to make the accusation public in a press
release, a.k.a. propaganda placement dated October 7, 2016. Its content
was attributed to the "USIC" by the Department of Homeland Security.
This press release was distributed with clear intent to influence the
election.  Read it here:
The key allegation:
"The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks
.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent
with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These
thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election
In keeping with propaganda best practices, this statement does not
actually accuse Russia of anything - not if you read it closely and
interpret it according to strict rules of grammar.  The source of the
statement is not identified:  There is no such agency as the United
States Intelligence Community (USIC per the press release), so it can
not be attributed to any responsible authority or formal reporting
process.  This is the safest way to tell a Big Lie.  The preceding
sentence is not a statement by me that it WAS a Big Lie - so if I get
dragged into Court for saying so, my hands are clean.
The inflammatory pre-election press release from the Obama
Administration's Department of Homeland Security was followed up by
numerous placements in the U.S. press, a constellation of assertions
consistent this template:
A reporter says an anonymous source claimed an unnamed senior
intelligence official told them that unspecified secret information
confirms Russian involvement in releasing incriminating DNC e-mails to
The timing, context and follow-on promotion of the DHS press release
blaming the leak on Russia indicate it was a component of a larger
campaign by the DNC on behalf of the Clinton campaign, intended to
demonize Trump by depicting his stated willingness to negotiate with
Russia as proof of collaboration with a foreign enemy.
Post-election, the DHS press release became the rarely-cited but always
referenced cornerstone of a separate campaign asserting that the
election was stolen by Russia and Trump.  This was the keynote of an
apparent attempt to persuade the Electors to install Hillary Clinton as
To the best of my knowledge - and I have been following this story
closely - no evidence of "Russian Hacking" has been presented to date.
We have been treated to a few code names of "hacking groups" allegedly
involved, and a couple of textbook diagrams of how hostile parties
penetrate network servers.  That is all.
If no evidence can be released due to legitimate concerns for protecting
sources and methods, and no substantial national security mission is
advanced by partisan accusations, it would be nice if the "USIC" would
stop exposing their super-secret capabilities to the world by asserting
what they knew and when they knew it.
Would these retaliations include, perhaps, the murder of the Russian
ambassador to Turkey, the downing of a Russian plane carrying an
irreplaceable cultural and diplomatic delegation to Syria, the rapid
deployment of a battalion strength U.S. armor force to the Russian
Federation border, and a missile attack on a Syrian airport by friendly
Israelis?  And if so, should we presume that all-around security expert
Bruce Schneier approve of these actions?
I could interpret the Obama Administration's 11th hour provocations
against Russia as an effort to create a massive foreign relations crisis
for the incoming Trump Administration, intended to overwhelm its
underqualified foreign policy contingent and deliver early control of
Trump Administration foreign policy to the U.S. intelligence
establishment and other Deep State actors.  Whether this might have been
a "wise" course to take, is a matter of opinion.  As would be the
legality of such a maneuver.
It may also be possible that the Obama Admninistration's pre-election
propaganda placement blaming the DNC leak on the Russian Federation
simply started a domino effect that ran out of control and nearly caused
World War III.
CNN?  I will not here repeat the propaganda slogan presently saturating
U.S. media, two words that malign the veracity of certain press outlets.
 But the shoe fits and Mr. Schneier will have a hard time taking it back
off.  That makes me sad.

Hash: SHA1
Security regression paradox:  What's to prevent whoever might have
replaced the binary in the repo - or replaced it in transit to you -
from also rigging the source?  So you have to audit the source.  And
the compiler that makes the source useable might have already been
compromised, so audit its source and then... oops, compile the audited
compiler using a potentially compromised compiler on a potentially
compromised OS.
This problem is no reason to just give up, but it does transform the
security picture from a purely imaginary secure vs. insecure binary
state, to an ecosystem of context-dependent compromise solutions.
The costs of an "acceptable" security result depend on this question:
 What it is worth to an adversary to break your security model, vs.
how much is preventing compromise of that asset worth to you?  If an
adversary spends less to successfully attack an asset than they gain
by doing so, the adversary wins.  If you spend more to successfully
defend an asset than that asset is worth to you, you lose.
This context provides a rational basis for allocating resources to
security, but alas, it rules out absolute values or one size fits all
solutions:  Who are your potential adversaries, what motivates them,
what resources are available to them?  Who benefits from your security
strategy, and what are they willing / able to pay - in additional
work, constraints on their behavior, and cash money - to secure the
assets in question?  A security model that does not take these factors
into accounts is a snake oil security model, regardless of the quality
of the tools used.

It seems to me that AP has not been implemented due to one deficit:
We have no means of implementing AP with adequate safeguards to
protect the operators and participants from the combined resources of
military and law enforcement agencies from numerous jurisdictions
AP may be "perfectly legal" for every participant except the prize
winners, but in the view of a targeted ruling class and its servants,
it is perfectly legal to kill the operators on discovery as long as
they do not get caught doing so.  If they do get caught, they can
simply change the laws.  Their propaganda capabilities would assure
broad public approval of any such changes.
AP is a novel means of waging class warfare, but if and when it gets
implemented the "enemies of the people" will not surrender or sit
quietly waiting to die, constrained by rule of law from striking back
with every means available to them.  As these means include already
established surveillance and manipulation capabilities spanning the
networks AP communications must hide in to be successful, early
implementations of AP would trigger an arms race.  Maybe the AP side
can win, but the lessons learned along the way to that victory would
be paid for in the blood of failed operators.  So far no one has shown
up with the necessary technical capabilities and confidence to take
the risk and pay the price.
A fully distributed network protocol for AP, with no single or
higher-value points of failure, clever enough to offer a credible (if
false) promise of security to early adopters, might someday get off
the ground.  But given that the global industrial economy will most
likely collapse first and take most of today's ruling class down with
it, I think it makes more sense to wait for the laws of physics to do
the job.
The more hard-headed anarchistic technologists we have when that
happens, the sooner a world (more) worth living in can replace the one
we have.  Since trying to make AP work in today's real would motivate
today's ruling class to thin that particular herd, I would not
encourage them to implement AP... just yet.

@_subject: Public Dissentiment 
Hash: SHA1
I do see a major problem with public perception of science, driven by
social trends in academia and the self-promotion interests of media
personalities presented to the public as the "voice of Science."  I
call it the Scientician faith:  Just change out a Bishop's crook and
mitre for a PhD and lab coat and viola, a High Priest.
In academia, a naive but paradoxically condescending brand of atheism
is the de facto State Religion.  At best, certain religions where
"liberal" political views hold sway may be tolerated as beneficial
exercises in applied social psychology (i.e. Unitarian, Quaker).  The
rest are lumped together as infantile, socially destructive delusions,
and disposed of with a handy set of strawman attacks against their
participants:  Sneering atheists always know /much/ more about the
motives and behavior of "religious" people than those people know
themselves, and never hesitate to fill them in.  In many instances it
is painfully obvious that atheism is a neurotic expression of a
repressed fear that God - the nasty one from fundamentalist fairy
tales - might exist.
The modern and correct replacement for naive religious belief is
Scientism, a faith whose adherents believe that science provides final
answers to all meaningful questions about life, the Universe "and
everything."  These believers would not know a falsifiable hypothesis
if it bit them in the ass, and can not distinguish a consensus model
from Holy Writ.  In their minds and lives, science is the final Voice
of Authority, completely and exactly filling the role the Church held
in the Dark and Middle Ages as final arbiter of Truth.  As a general
rule, only working scientists know that this is ridiculous - and I do
not include the "social sciences" in this grouping.
The Scientician faith has spread beyond academia, establishing itself
as a popular cult through media personalities presented as High
Priests of Scientism.  In the process, personalities who serve as the
public Voices of Science have become useful tools for propagandists
tasked to promote "scientific" industrial products and public policy.
 Astrophysicists are especially well suited to this role, as their job
is to explain "everything."  Carl Sagan, a brilliant entertainer but
3rd rate scientist whose only notable contribution to the literature
(signing off on a geophysical model of nuclear winter) lasted for just
a few months before being discarded by community consensus, set the
pattern.  Neil Tyson now fills his shoes, reaching an audience of tens
of millions with The Truth about various controversial issues in
geophysics, the life sciences and public health policy on behalf of
corporate sponsors.  In the public mind, an astrophysicist is an
expert on everything that exists.
This brings us to a real problem of much more than "academic" concern:
 The role of corporate sponsorship as a regulating factor in research,
publication and the evolution of consensus models in the sciences.
The propaganda activities of petrochemicals lobbies, for instance,
offer literal bounties for anyone with a PhD in any field related to
geophysics who will go on record with the opinion that global warming
is not real, and/or that human activity has nothing to do with it.
These same information warriors fund a cottage industry that creates
spurious "proofs" that the Earth is actually cooling, for use in media
campaigns.  This has so far been a losing battle, in that an
overwhelming consensus supports global warming - but creating "doubt
and dissent" is sufficient to defend de facto genocidal public policy.
On the immunology, toxicology and epidemiology fronts, however, we
have a very different outcome:  Any findings harmful to the commercial
interests of the multi-billion dollar PharmaChem research and
development industry are in the "publish and perish" category for
workers in these fields.  As an example, any layman who examines
public health statistics looking for the miracle working impact of
"life saving vaccines" over the last century will notice that there
was no such impact; but people who are paid to do so must pretend
otherwise.  A two year study falsifying the results of the most
frequently cited papers indicating that flu vaccines has a significant
impact on mortality was greeted by the Journal of the American Medical
Association with, “To accept these results would be to say that the
Earth is flat!”  True story...
When genetic engineering first became possible in the early 1970s,
geneticists and microbiologists did not debate the safety of the
technology, so much as which containment technologies should be
mandated by law, to positively prevent the escape of its products from
the laboratory setting.  But when the first commercial products of
genetic engineering were developed, no less a can-do guy than Donald
Rumsfeld successfully lobbied the Bush I Administration to have
transgenics based factory farming declared to be in the National
Interest of the United States.  Today, studies indicating that key
components of this technology are endocrine disruptors, carcinogens,
and have acutely detrimental ecological side-effects are pointedly
ignored by academia.
Astrophysicists can assure us that transgenics based factory farming
is a "life saving" technology, but geneticists who talk about the
potential hazards of commercialized genetic engineering are not
welcome on the talk show circuit.
"Faith in science" is at best a grossly unreliable compass for those
who do not understand the methods and history of science, and the
impact of un- and anti-scientific influences on the practice of
science in the real world.  Those who do understand science know
better than to have "faith" in its methods and products, but do have
well justified confidence that the oldest and best established
consensus models in physics will "very very likely" continue to hold
up over time, in the physical contexts where they were originally
developed and tested.

You said a mouthful right there.  A battle was won, but in the
material scope of the war at hand, it was a small battle.  But
Standing Rock was a transformational battle in that, although the
tribal government remains careful to call it a "peaceful protest,"
everyone who was paying any real attention knows it morphed into an
act of economic warfare, backed by battalion strength mobile infantry.
By modern uber-mechanized warfare standards, that was four battalions
just then.  And they or their replacements will most likely be wanted
at the front again - and at others as a Summer Of Discontent sets new

I Predict:
* More conflict between U.S. State power and "civil society" groups.
Now that the DNC can safely "point fingers" at joint DemoPublican
policies that are offensive to Liberals, a big well funded push for
"protest rally" level actions will happen.  Radical factions will use
these events as recruiting venues and may often succeed in co-opting
the message.
* A paradigm shift from Protest to Direct Action in populist politics.
Example:  Last year's rapid assembly of a larger than battalion
strength force of veterans in defense of the Standing Rock action:
The Home Team wants that to be a watershed event setting a big
precedent, the Other Guys want it to be a one-off fluke which will not
be seen again.  I think the resulting war for hearts, minds, wallets
and feet will present something Our Side can work with.
* New alliances between formerly Left and Right activists.
As shit continues to get more real on a week to week basis, a lot of
people who "thought they were" Liberal or Conservative because they
identified with emotional appeals wired into one or the other flavor
of propaganda will start to actually think about politics for the
first time.  Not many will go rogue, but those who do will be
disproportionately influential.
* NeoLiberal billionaires will wage covert wars on U.S. soil.
This is pure crystal ball stuff, don't ask me to explain why:  When I
load my current "war map" of the world in my imagination and run it, I
see private armies at work all over the U.S.  Their principal targets
will be economic and political.  Deniability will be their watchword,
exposure their Achilles' heel.
* No net gain or loss on the network privacy/security front.
Real progress on technical fronts will be counter balanced by growing
popular demand for fully automatic security, hidden behind a seamless
User Experience design paradigm.  Don't bother telling folks that
total ignorance and reliable security are mutually exclusive; they
want an instant E-Z one step solution, and Millennials seem to think
this is a human right.

The official excuse for WTC 7's symmetrical collapse is that the side
of the building /not/ shown clearly in photos was "scooped out" by
falling debris.  (The photos I have seen do indicate substantial
damage to the facade from falling debris.)  This is not consistent
with a symmetrical collapse as observed - the support columns
destroyed by the "scoop" provided no vertical support, so the load was
distributed unevenly and the building would have sagged in that
direction when it lost global structural integrity.  But never mind

Soon after its publication, the PNAC team took over the White House at

just saw (excuse me, "witnessed") but also why the instant global
mechanical failure of the towers happened, to the swift and complete

everything about the 911 narrative points to deception and
concealment.  Not to mention happy coincidences:  Secretary Rumsfeld
announced that trillions of dollars were unaccounted for by the
Pentagon, then a missile (excuse me, airliner) scored a direct hit on
the office of the auditors chasing the missing funds.
That "man in the street" who launched the first 911 Big Lie?  He
happens to have also been on the scene at an "active shooter" event at
an airport just a couple of years ago, where he was "man on the scene"
interviewed by a TV news crew:  Another of those remarkable
coincidences that - absent prompt, competent and well funded
investigation - mean nothing and sink below the noise floor of history

in their favorite flavors of independent analysis, are welcome to jump

estimate of what happened leaves LOTS of room for uncertainties, and
the only map of the world affected is my very own.

I could interpret the Obama Administration's 11th hour provocations
against Russia as an effort to create a massive foreign relations crisis
for the incoming Trump Administration, intended to overwhelm its
underqualified foreign policy contingent and deliver early control of
Trump Administration foreign policy to the U.S. intelligence
establishment and other Deep State actors.  Whether this might have been
a "wise" course to take, is a matter of opinion.  As would be the
legality of such a maneuver.
It may also be possible that the Obama Admninistration's pre-election
propaganda placement blaming the DNC leak on the Russian Federation
simply started a domino effect that ran out of control and nearly caused
World War III.
CNN?  I will not here repeat the propaganda slogan presently saturating

 But the shoe fits and Mr. Schneier will have a hard time taking it back

Hash: SHA1
Security regression paradox:  What's to prevent whoever might have
replaced the binary in the repo - or replaced it in transit to you -
from also rigging the source?  So you have to audit the source.  And
the compiler that makes the source useable might have already been
compromised, so audit its source and then... oops, compile the audited
compiler using a potentially compromised compiler on a potentially
compromised OS.
This problem is no reason to just give up, but it does transform the
security picture from a purely imaginary secure vs. insecure binary
state, to an ecosystem of context-dependent compromise solutions.
The costs of an "acceptable" security result depend on this question:
 What it is worth to an adversary to break your security model, vs.
how much is preventing compromise of that asset worth to you?  If an
adversary spends less to successfully attack an asset than they gain
by doing so, the adversary wins.  If you spend more to successfully
defend an asset than that asset is worth to you, you lose.
This context provides a rational basis for allocating resources to
security, but alas, it rules out absolute values or one size fits all
solutions:  Who are your potential adversaries, what motivates them,
what resources are available to them?  Who benefits from your security
strategy, and what are they willing / able to pay - in additional
work, constraints on their behavior, and cash money - to secure the
assets in question?  A security model that does not take these factors
into accounts is a snake oil security model, regardless of the quality
of the tools used.

It seems to me that AP has not been implemented due to one deficit:
We have no means of implementing AP with adequate safeguards to
protect the operators and participants from the combined resources of
military and law enforcement agencies from numerous jurisdictions
AP may be "perfectly legal" for every participant except the prize
winners, but in the view of a targeted ruling class and its servants,
it is perfectly legal to kill the operators on discovery as long as
they do not get caught doing so.  If they do get caught, they can
simply change the laws.  Their propaganda capabilities would assure
broad public approval of any such changes.
AP is a novel means of waging class warfare, but if and when it gets
implemented the "enemies of the people" will not surrender or sit
quietly waiting to die, constrained by rule of law from striking back
with every means available to them.  As these means include already
established surveillance and manipulation capabilities spanning the
networks AP communications must hide in to be successful, early
implementations of AP would trigger an arms race.  Maybe the AP side
can win, but the lessons learned along the way to that victory would
be paid for in the blood of failed operators.  So far no one has shown
up with the necessary technical capabilities and confidence to take
the risk and pay the price.
A fully distributed network protocol for AP, with no single or
higher-value points of failure, clever enough to offer a credible (if
false) promise of security to early adopters, might someday get off
the ground.  But given that the global industrial economy will most
likely collapse first and take most of today's ruling class down with
it, I think it makes more sense to wait for the laws of physics to do
the job.
The more hard-headed anarchistic technologists we have when that
happens, the sooner a world (more) worth living in can replace the one
we have.  Since trying to make AP work in today's real would motivate
today's ruling class to thin that particular herd, I would not
encourage them to implement AP... just yet.

@_subject: Public Dissentiment 
Hash: SHA1
I do see a major problem with public perception of science, driven by
social trends in academia and the self-promotion interests of media
personalities presented to the public as the "voice of Science."  I
call it the Scientician faith:  Just change out a Bishop's crook and
mitre for a PhD and lab coat and viola, a High Priest.
In academia, a naive but paradoxically condescending brand of atheism
is the de facto State Religion.  At best, certain religions where
"liberal" political views hold sway may be tolerated as beneficial
exercises in applied social psychology (i.e. Unitarian, Quaker).  The
rest are lumped together as infantile, socially destructive delusions,
and disposed of with a handy set of strawman attacks against their
participants:  Sneering atheists always know /much/ more about the
motives and behavior of "religious" people than those people know
themselves, and never hesitate to fill them in.  In many instances it
is painfully obvious that atheism is a neurotic expression of a
repressed fear that God - the nasty one from fundamentalist fairy
tales - might exist.
The modern and correct replacement for naive religious belief is
Scientism, a faith whose adherents believe that science provides final
answers to all meaningful questions about life, the Universe "and
everything."  These believers would not know a falsifiable hypothesis
if it bit them in the ass, and can not distinguish a consensus model
from Holy Writ.  In their minds and lives, science is the final Voice
of Authority, completely and exactly filling the role the Church held
in the Dark and Middle Ages as final arbiter of Truth.  As a general
rule, only working scientists know that this is ridiculous - and I do
not include the "social sciences" in this grouping.
The Scientician faith has spread beyond academia, establishing itself
as a popular cult through media personalities presented as High
Priests of Scientism.  In the process, personalities who serve as the
public Voices of Science have become useful tools for propagandists
tasked to promote "scientific" industrial products and public policy.
 Astrophysicists are especially well suited to this role, as their job
is to explain "everything."  Carl Sagan, a brilliant entertainer but
3rd rate scientist whose only notable contribution to the literature
(signing off on a geophysical model of nuclear winter) lasted for just
a few months before being discarded by community consensus, set the
pattern.  Neil Tyson now fills his shoes, reaching an audience of tens
of millions with The Truth about various controversial issues in
geophysics, the life sciences and public health policy on behalf of
corporate sponsors.  In the public mind, an astrophysicist is an
expert on everything that exists.
This brings us to a real problem of much more than "academic" concern:
 The role of corporate sponsorship as a regulating factor in research,
publication and the evolution of consensus models in the sciences.
The propaganda activities of petrochemicals lobbies, for instance,
offer literal bounties for anyone with a PhD in any field related to
geophysics who will go on record with the opinion that global warming
is not real, and/or that human activity has nothing to do with it.
These same information warriors fund a cottage industry that creates
spurious "proofs" that the Earth is actually cooling, for use in media
campaigns.  This has so far been a losing battle, in that an
overwhelming consensus supports global warming - but creating "doubt
and dissent" is sufficient to defend de facto genocidal public policy.
On the immunology, toxicology and epidemiology fronts, however, we
have a very different outcome:  Any findings harmful to the commercial
interests of the multi-billion dollar PharmaChem research and
development industry are in the "publish and perish" category for
workers in these fields.  As an example, any layman who examines
public health statistics looking for the miracle working impact of
"life saving vaccines" over the last century will notice that there
was no such impact; but people who are paid to do so must pretend
otherwise.  A two year study falsifying the results of the most
frequently cited papers indicating that flu vaccines has a significant
impact on mortality was greeted by the Journal of the American Medical
Association with, “To accept these results would be to say that the
Earth is flat!”  True story...
When genetic engineering first became possible in the early 1970s,
geneticists and microbiologists did not debate the safety of the
technology, so much as which containment technologies should be
mandated by law, to positively prevent the escape of its products from
the laboratory setting.  But when the first commercial products of
genetic engineering were developed, no less a can-do guy than Donald
Rumsfeld successfully lobbied the Bush I Administration to have
transgenics based factory farming declared to be in the National
Interest of the United States.  Today, studies indicating that key
components of this technology are endocrine disruptors, carcinogens,
and have acutely detrimental ecological side-effects are pointedly
ignored by academia.
Astrophysicists can assure us that transgenics based factory farming
is a "life saving" technology, but geneticists who talk about the
potential hazards of commercialized genetic engineering are not
welcome on the talk show circuit.
"Faith in science" is at best a grossly unreliable compass for those
who do not understand the methods and history of science, and the
impact of un- and anti-scientific influences on the practice of
science in the real world.  Those who do understand science know
better than to have "faith" in its methods and products, but do have
well justified confidence that the oldest and best established
consensus models in physics will "very very likely" continue to hold
up over time, in the physical contexts where they were originally
developed and tested.

A couple of days ago Shawn pointed out offlist that my GPG installation
was using SHA1 when signing messages.  Although seven hash functions are
included in GnuPG 1.4.16, SHA1 is still the default.
For most purposes this is no cause for panic, but it's "untidy" at best
and might occasionally bite someone in the ass.
The simple cure is to append this to gpg.conf:
personal-digest-preferences SHA256 SHA512
digest-algo SHA256
I wonder when the gpg guise will get around to updating the default hash...
On a related note, gnupg-agent stores typed pass phrases for 10 minutes,
as a convenience when reading or signing multiple files or documents.
Only one little thing:  It stores typed pass phrases until the machine
is powered off, regardless of configuration settings per the gnupg-agent
man page.
Last time I checked, this bug was dismissed by Debian as a non-issue,
saying that exploiting it would require physical access to the machine
and "physical access is game over."  That's an excuse to leave the bug
in place, not a reason.  I am sure present company can provide several
examples of cases where the presence of gnupg-agent in its present
broken condition "is game over" for the user.
Four years ago I noticed this problem, exhausted "sane" remedies, and
found an effective work-around that denies gnupg-agent access to pass
phrases when using Enigmail or GPG itself.

I created gpg-agent.conf and put it in the right directory per the man
page, because it was not there... and it had no effect.
Especially disturbing because, although I never have a reason to type a
GPG pass phrase as an administrator, logging out of my user account did
not remove the pass phrase from memory.  Nothing short of powering off

From the post @ videolan.org:  "VLC trust and diffusion has been also
being exploited by CIA."  And:  "So VLC is responsible to let attacks
inject malware bundled with the software package, because it's only VLC
project maintainer responsibility to use HTTPS as the only method to
prevent a third party attacker to hijack VLC website content and files."
Against hostile State actors, HTTPS only provides a false sense of
security.  If your threat model includes the CIA, reliance on HTTPS is a
fundamental error in the "game over" category.
The HTTPS procotol implemented in web browsers relies on digital
signatures by 3rd parties called Certificate Authorities to
transparently verify that the key used for the "secure" connection
belongs to the website in question.  Any actor who owns a copy of any
one of the numerous Certificate Authorities' signing keys can sign an
SSL certificate in any website's name, and it will be accepted as
authentic by any web browser.
The HTTPS trust model is broken at the foundation.  This does not make
HTTPS useless; smaller criminal organizations and hostile individuals do
not normally have access to Certificate Authority signing keys, and so
can not effectively do man in the middle attacks against HTTPS
connections.  In most cases implementing HTTPS is worth doing - as long
as it is understood that this provides no protection against large, well
funded adversaries.
See above:  It seems likely that the people at videolan.org have a basic
understanding of how digital attacks work, more so than someone who
believes that HTTPS can interfere with attacks by State actors.
If it is urgent and important for videolan.org to use HTTPS, preventing
MITM attacks by State actors (or other criminal gangs with substantial
resources) is not the reason.
A more effective way to protect against malware injection via
substitution of executables in transit, is for the distributor to
digitally sign the installers themselves.  This method is not 100%
reliable - nothing is - but at present it's the best method we have.
And note that it is already implemented in the Linux software repositories.

A camera signature does not need to be unique to be very valuable to an

Conversion to a vector format with the aid of an auto-trace program

If the photo needs to still look like a photo when you're done
sanitizing it, the GMIC filter pack's tool set may be useful, with
effects like bilateral smoothing etc. that wipe out small scale noise
signatures.  Conversion to grayscale, or or reducing color resolution
and changing RGB balance would also be a good idea.  Exporting sanitized
images in an indexed format with a limited size palette (i.e. GIF) would
be helpful. But no matter what, if you remove enough detail to
confidently disassociate the photo from the camera, image quality will
suffer quite visibly.
One's method for altering photos to disassociate them from individual

"Liberal" is such a broadly defined term that I don't think of it as a
political or economic theory so much as a propaganda buzzword roughly
meaning "socially permissive in a good sense."  In propaganda advocating
for Liberalism its connotations include generosity, fairness and
tolerance.  In propaganda advocating against Liberalism its connotations
include naivety, larceny and evil.
When I say "19th century" political and economic theory, I generally
mean Capitalism, Communism and hybrid variants like Socialism - not
because they were invented then, but because they became widely known
and instances were implemented about then, as adaptations to the
Industrial Revolution.
That sounds like Anarchism to me.
That sounds like Representative Democracy.  In a society that
consistently teaches and promotes Anarchism it might work, as long as
the units of governance do not exceed a scale permitting "ordinary
people" to observe and understand the activities of State and private
power centers on a continuing basis, enabling effective feedback via
both the ballot box /and/ direct action on the ground.
Oh, those bothersome buzzwords!  Unless one explicitly defines them,
they tend to mean whatever promoters and their audiences wants them to
mean, in a self congratulatory context.
In propaganda application as Identity Politics brand labels, "Liberal"
and "Libertarian" often mean approximately opposite things in practical
Liberal generally suggests a preference for a Nanny State that devotes
itself to providing a comprehensive safety net to assure that nobody
suffers poverty or persecution.  This general idea gets a lot of support
from people with a deep investment in social conformity and highly
formalized status hierarchies i.e. academic degrees as a basis for
employment discrimination.
Libertarian generally suggests a minimalist State that only arbitrates
disputes between members of an economic ruling class, leaving everything
but tort law (and its enforcement at gunpoint) to the private sector.
This general idea gets a lot of support from our "temporarily
embarrassed millionaires":  Me-first individualists who just know that
if their inferiors stopped conspiring to keep them down, they would
accomplish Great Things.
I do not think of Anarchism as a form of government or economics.
Rather, I consider it a body of theory and practice relevant to
resisting the concentration and abuse of power in the hands of an elite
minority.  Humans do compete for dominance, some more than others, and
once a specialized ruling class has acquired control of significant
territory and its inhabitants, a feedback cycle sets in that continues
to concentrate more power in fewer hands.  This process does not end
well, and restraining it by what some call "direct democracy" may delay
or prevent the worst abuses of power.
Among all these ideas, I really want to promote the a definition of
Anarchism as a theory of politics and economics as a dynamic system of
power relationships between and among competing groups, with emphasis on
methods for redistributing power down the status hierarchy, preventing
dominance by elite minorities to the fullest practicable extent.  As
such, Anarchism provides a general purpose tool kit for troubleshooting
and attempting to repair Utopian political/economic regimes.

As for "the founders," they did indeed want to defend their rights as
equals - within their own class as wealthy individuals, vs. those closer
to the center of power in England.  They also "wanted to" defend their
right to abuse and exploit their social inferiors, as shown by the fact
that they did so:  First by employing slave labor including transportees
from England, and chattel property imported from Africa; then by
refusing to pay the wages due Revolutionary War soldiers they contracted
with to fight their battle against the Crown.  The Colonial ruling class
did not organize a Revolution to obtain freedom from anything but their
contractual obligations to the Crown.
Our current crop of Constitutional scholars seem to largely agree that
the Convention was called for the primary purpose of creating a Federal
authority capable of putting down armed uprisings against major land
holders who refused to pay their debts to foolish peasants.
The sole function of the State is to support economic activity, and
absent organized resistance leveraging the massive numerical superiority
of penniless peasants, that means facilitating the interests of
billionaires at everyone else's expense.
In Libertarian Fantasy Land, incorruptible Courts can exist, and tort

Beg to disagree:  As an example, the original Labor Movement forced the
Robber Barons to accept a settlement negotiated through State
institutions.  The New Deal worked, not just in the U.S. but also in
Germany where the Nazi party applied many features of that model and
pulled the country back from the brink of starvation.  Even given the
then-prevailing German tradition of unconditional obedience to
authority, they would most likely have rebelled against the excesses of
the Nazi agenda had the Party not earned their loyalty by literally
saving their country from total ruin.
Likewise, the U.S. Civil Rights movement obtained massive concessions
via economic and information warfare, again resulting in a negotiated
settlement between organized peasants and their rulers.
Conditions favorable for a massive popular uprising seem to be on the
way in the United States right now, as a consequence of geophysical and

I see a lot of problems with education.
"Those who can, do; those who can't, teach."  Not always true, of
course.  But it becomes more so when extended to include "...and those
who can't even teach, become educators."  People are people and no
generalization fits all cases, but I have seen the writing on the wall.
I have seen educators whose principal objectives included cost
containment, defense of funding though a politically mandated 'teach to
the test' agenda, and pursuit of funding by presenting de facto
advertising and/or banning a corporate benefactor's competitors from the
classroom.  This all puts educators at odds with teachers - especially
teachers who want to help their students learn to "think for
themselves."  The educators have command authority in the enterprise, so
the teachers rarely win.
Professionals in every field that involves persuasion - sales,
advertising, business administration, military and political propaganda
- all use "education" as a preferred synonym for "indoctrination."
Doctrines, a.k.a. fixed protocols, can have their uses when properly
understood as tools under their users' conscious control.  Science and
engineering programs openly discuss this principle and its role in their
fields of endeavor; but the "fuzzy studies" programs lean strongly
toward applying indoctrination in the classroom, preparing students to
apply the specified doctrines after graduation, as authorities in their
various fields.
A large majority of University students attend for just one reason:  To
buy their way onto the right side of an employment discrimination
barrier, an ironclad agreement among college graduates that they will
support their "own kind" via preference in hiring, promotion and
compensation.  Reading job postings, one sees numerous job descriptions
where requirements include a degree in /any/ firld, with no regard to
its relevance to the work in question.  In those cases the employer
wants proof of social rank, not evidence of competency.
The American Dream of equal opportunity notwithstanding, the U.S.
pay-for-play University system enforces a rigid social class barrier:
Students whose parents can afford to heavily subsidize their tuitions
emerge as winners, while the student loan scam leaves graduates of
"lower social standing" in an upside down financial position they can
not dig their way out of, even on the right side of the employment
discrimination barrier.
I find it more than ironic that people enrolled in "fuzzy studies"
programs geared to the needs of mediocre students so often speak against
"class privilege", while diligently working to safeguard, formalize and
exploit their own class privilege by completing that degree program and
presenting a certificate of conformity when they hit the employment
market.  At least they are "not racists."  Any black, brown, yellow or
etc. person can become as "white" as anyone else by getting a college
diploma.  True Believers in higher education all know about - but rarely
mention - the ignorance, laziness, etc. that account for anyone's
failure to "better themselves" through a college education.
I strongly doubt that these and similar problems can be solved by
educators - even in the unlikely event that a consensus to solve them
emerges among that group:  They do not control the purse strings, and
neither do their student 'customers.'  The systemic disorders in higher
education reflect systemic disorders in society as a whole, which seems
inevitable as long as higher education remains an integral part of the

A couple of days ago Shawn pointed out offlist that my GPG installation
was using SHA1 when signing messages.  Although seven hash functions are
included in GnuPG 1.4.16, SHA1 is still the default.
For most purposes this is no cause for panic, but it's "untidy" at best
and might occasionally bite someone in the ass.
The simple cure is to append this to gpg.conf:
personal-digest-preferences SHA256 SHA512
digest-algo SHA256
I wonder when the gpg guise will get around to updating the default hash...
On a related note, gnupg-agent stores typed pass phrases for 10 minutes,
as a convenience when reading or signing multiple files or documents.
Only one little thing:  It stores typed pass phrases until the machine
is powered off, regardless of configuration settings per the gnupg-agent
man page.
Last time I checked, this bug was dismissed by Debian as a non-issue,
saying that exploiting it would require physical access to the machine
and "physical access is game over."  That's an excuse to leave the bug
in place, not a reason.  I am sure present company can provide several
examples of cases where the presence of gnupg-agent in its present
broken condition "is game over" for the user.
Four years ago I noticed this problem, exhausted "sane" remedies, and
found an effective work-around that denies gnupg-agent access to pass
phrases when using Enigmail or GPG itself.

Quite sure:  Taking measures to specifically deny the passphrase to

time, on a system where Cinnamon is the default desktop.
I created gpg-agent.conf and put it in the right directory per the man
page, because it was not there... and it had no effect.
Especially disturbing because, although I never have a reason to type a
GPG pass phrase as an administrator, logging out of my user account did
not remove the pass phrase from memory.  Nothing short of powering off
did the job.

From the post @ videolan.org:  "VLC trust and diffusion has been also
being exploited by CIA."  And:  "So VLC is responsible to let attacks
inject malware bundled with the software package, because it's only VLC
project maintainer responsibility to use HTTPS as the only method to
prevent a third party attacker to hijack VLC website content and files."
Against hostile State actors, HTTPS only provides a false sense of
security.  If your threat model includes the CIA, reliance on HTTPS is a
fundamental error in the "game over" category.
The HTTPS procotol implemented in web browsers relies on digital
signatures by 3rd parties called Certificate Authorities to
transparently verify that the key used for the "secure" connection
belongs to the website in question.  Any actor who owns a copy of any
one of the numerous Certificate Authorities' signing keys can sign an
SSL certificate in any website's name, and it will be accepted as
authentic by any web browser.
The HTTPS trust model is broken at the foundation.  This does not make
HTTPS useless; smaller criminal organizations and hostile individuals do
not normally have access to Certificate Authority signing keys, and so
can not effectively do man in the middle attacks against HTTPS
connections.  In most cases implementing HTTPS is worth doing - as long
as it is understood that this provides no protection against large, well
funded adversaries.
See above:  It seems likely that the people at videolan.org have a basic
understanding of how digital attacks work, more so than someone who
believes that HTTPS can interfere with attacks by State actors.
If it is urgent and important for videolan.org to use HTTPS, preventing
MITM attacks by State actors (or other criminal gangs with substantial
resources) is not the reason.
A more effective way to protect against malware injection via
substitution of executables in transit, is for the distributor to
digitally sign the installers themselves.  This method is not 100%
reliable - nothing is - but at present it's the best method we have.
And note that it is already implemented in the Linux software repositories.

ignorant and profoundly neurotic, that they are not actually stupid.
Lockout functions that take significant time and effort to defeat (when

all U.S. nuclear warhead firing circuits was a string of zeros.
In the case of weapons eligible for export, I would only be a /little/
less confident that back doors are not included:  One wants one's
allies' weapons to work as advertised, and the blowback from discovered
back doors would be very costly.
As is done with proprietary trade secret operating systems etc., these
back doors would be called "bugs" or "design flaws" when discovered, and
this hard to disprove canard would be widely accepted as fact.  But when
(not if) back doors weapons systems are discovered, that would be Bad

I would not trust that very far:  Signatures from hot pixels may remain

A camera signature does not need to be unique to be very valuable to an
adversary who has other means at hand to narrow the field of candidates
for creator of this or that image of interest.
Conversion to a vector format with the aid of an auto-trace program
should work reliably, at the cost of a /massive/ loss of resolution.
If the photo needs to still look like a photo when you're done
sanitizing it, the GMIC filter pack's tool set may be useful, with
effects like bilateral smoothing etc. that wipe out small scale noise
signatures.  Conversion to grayscale, or or reducing color resolution
and changing RGB balance would also be a good idea.  Exporting sanitized
images in an indexed format with a limited size palette (i.e. GIF) would
be helpful. But no matter what, if you remove enough detail to
confidently disassociate the photo from the camera, image quality will
suffer quite visibly.
One's method for altering photos to disassociate them from individual

"Liberal" is such a broadly defined term that I don't think of it as a
political or economic theory so much as a propaganda buzzword roughly
meaning "socially permissive in a good sense."  In propaganda advocating
for Liberalism its connotations include generosity, fairness and
tolerance.  In propaganda advocating against Liberalism its connotations
include naivety, larceny and evil.
When I say "19th century" political and economic theory, I generally
mean Capitalism, Communism and hybrid variants like Socialism - not
because they were invented then, but because they became widely known
and instances were implemented about then, as adaptations to the
Industrial Revolution.
That sounds like Anarchism to me.
That sounds like Representative Democracy.  In a society that
consistently teaches and promotes Anarchism it might work, as long as
the units of governance do not exceed a scale permitting "ordinary
people" to observe and understand the activities of State and private
power centers on a continuing basis, enabling effective feedback via
both the ballot box /and/ direct action on the ground.
Oh, those bothersome buzzwords!  Unless one explicitly defines them,
they tend to mean whatever promoters and their audiences wants them to
mean, in a self congratulatory context.
In propaganda application as Identity Politics brand labels, "Liberal"
and "Libertarian" often mean approximately opposite things in practical
Liberal generally suggests a preference for a Nanny State that devotes
itself to providing a comprehensive safety net to assure that nobody
suffers poverty or persecution.  This general idea gets a lot of support
from people with a deep investment in social conformity and highly
formalized status hierarchies i.e. academic degrees as a basis for
employment discrimination.
Libertarian generally suggests a minimalist State that only arbitrates
disputes between members of an economic ruling class, leaving everything
but tort law (and its enforcement at gunpoint) to the private sector.
This general idea gets a lot of support from our "temporarily
embarrassed millionaires":  Me-first individualists who just know that
if their inferiors stopped conspiring to keep them down, they would
accomplish Great Things.
I do not think of Anarchism as a form of government or economics.
Rather, I consider it a body of theory and practice relevant to
resisting the concentration and abuse of power in the hands of an elite
minority.  Humans do compete for dominance, some more than others, and
once a specialized ruling class has acquired control of significant
territory and its inhabitants, a feedback cycle sets in that continues
to concentrate more power in fewer hands.  This process does not end
well, and restraining it by what some call "direct democracy" may delay
or prevent the worst abuses of power.
Among all these ideas, I really want to promote the a definition of
Anarchism as a theory of politics and economics as a dynamic system of
power relationships between and among competing groups, with emphasis on
methods for redistributing power down the status hierarchy, preventing
dominance by elite minorities to the fullest practicable extent.  As
such, Anarchism provides a general purpose tool kit for troubleshooting
and attempting to repair Utopian political/economic regimes.

Any time I talk about politics or political history in a crowded room,
someone is certain to dismiss what I say by calling it "cynical."  Don't
feel bad - one of the smartest people I ever knew called me that just
yesterday.  For reals.
As for "the founders," they did indeed want to defend their rights as
equals - within their own class as wealthy individuals, vs. those closer
to the center of power in England.  They also "wanted to" defend their
right to abuse and exploit their social inferiors, as shown by the fact
that they did so:  First by employing slave labor including transportees
from England, and chattel property imported from Africa; then by
refusing to pay the wages due Revolutionary War soldiers they contracted
with to fight their battle against the Crown.  The Colonial ruling class
did not organize a Revolution to obtain freedom from anything but their
contractual obligations to the Crown.
Our current crop of Constitutional scholars seem to largely agree that
the Convention was called for the primary purpose of creating a Federal
authority capable of putting down armed uprisings against major land
holders who refused to pay their debts to foolish peasants.
The sole function of the State is to support economic activity, and
absent organized resistance leveraging the massive numerical superiority
of penniless peasants, that means facilitating the interests of
billionaires at everyone else's expense.
In Libertarian Fantasy Land, incorruptible Courts can exist, and tort
litigation takes place on a level playing field not matter how many
orders of magnitude separate the income and assets of the contending
parties, i.e. the resources they can bring to bear to manipulate both
fact and process.
The eagerness of idealists of all stripes to self-mutililate for the

Beg to disagree:  As an example, the original Labor Movement forced the
Robber Barons to accept a settlement negotiated through State
institutions.  The New Deal worked, not just in the U.S. but also in
Germany where the Nazi party applied many features of that model and
pulled the country back from the brink of starvation.  Even given the
then-prevailing German tradition of unconditional obedience to
authority, they would most likely have rebelled against the excesses of
the Nazi agenda had the Party not earned their loyalty by literally
saving their country from total ruin.
Likewise, the U.S. Civil Rights movement obtained massive concessions
via economic and information warfare, again resulting in a negotiated
settlement between organized peasants and their rulers.
Conditions favorable for a massive popular uprising seem to be on the
way in the United States right now, as a consequence of geophysical and
geopolitical factors no amount of Super Science or etc. can wish away.

techniques, and start looking for winning teams to join up with - or for
that matter, to start one's own.

Tung to the authors of current U.S. Army counter-insurgency manuals

I see a lot of problems with education.
"Those who can, do; those who can't, teach."  Not always true, of
course.  But it becomes more so when extended to include "...and those
who can't even teach, become educators."  People are people and no
generalization fits all cases, but I have seen the writing on the wall.
I have seen educators whose principal objectives included cost
containment, defense of funding though a politically mandated 'teach to
the test' agenda, and pursuit of funding by presenting de facto
advertising and/or banning a corporate benefactor's competitors from the
classroom.  This all puts educators at odds with teachers - especially
teachers who want to help their students learn to "think for
themselves."  The educators have command authority in the enterprise, so
the teachers rarely win.
Professionals in every field that involves persuasion - sales,
advertising, business administration, military and political propaganda
- all use "education" as a preferred synonym for "indoctrination."
Doctrines, a.k.a. fixed protocols, can have their uses when properly
understood as tools under their users' conscious control.  Science and
engineering programs openly discuss this principle and its role in their
fields of endeavor; but the "fuzzy studies" programs lean strongly
toward applying indoctrination in the classroom, preparing students to
apply the specified doctrines after graduation, as authorities in their
various fields.
A large majority of University students attend for just one reason:  To
buy their way onto the right side of an employment discrimination
barrier, an ironclad agreement among college graduates that they will
support their "own kind" via preference in hiring, promotion and
compensation.  Reading job postings, one sees numerous job descriptions
where requirements include a degree in /any/ firld, with no regard to
its relevance to the work in question.  In those cases the employer
wants proof of social rank, not evidence of competency.
The American Dream of equal opportunity notwithstanding, the U.S.
pay-for-play University system enforces a rigid social class barrier:
Students whose parents can afford to heavily subsidize their tuitions
emerge as winners, while the student loan scam leaves graduates of
"lower social standing" in an upside down financial position they can
not dig their way out of, even on the right side of the employment
discrimination barrier.
I find it more than ironic that people enrolled in "fuzzy studies"
programs geared to the needs of mediocre students so often speak against
"class privilege", while diligently working to safeguard, formalize and
exploit their own class privilege by completing that degree program and
presenting a certificate of conformity when they hit the employment
market.  At least they are "not racists."  Any black, brown, yellow or
etc. person can become as "white" as anyone else by getting a college
diploma.  True Believers in higher education all know about - but rarely
mention - the ignorance, laziness, etc. that account for anyone's
failure to "better themselves" through a college education.
I strongly doubt that these and similar problems can be solved by
educators - even in the unlikely event that a consensus to solve them
emerges among that group:  They do not control the purse strings, and
neither do their student 'customers.'  The systemic disorders in higher
education reflect systemic disorders in society as a whole, which seems
inevitable as long as higher education remains an integral part of the
disordered system.
I do have some hope that the descendants of those who survive the
upcoming collapse of the global material economy will create a /much/
better educational system: Decentralized, consensus driven, inexpensive
and adaptable, facilitating the practical objectives of people and
communities organized on a far less self destructive basis than our

My guess is that Snowden was an unwitting agent, spotted early by the
insider threat program and selected for use in a limited hangout.  If
so, he was exposed to scripted events in the workplace to draw his
attention to specific programs, and given e-z access to selected
documents related to those programs.  In the network age, censorship
ranges from difficult to impossible depending on the context; getting
ahead of an adversary and dominating the messaging on a given topic has
gained a new importance.  I think the Snowden Affair may be an example.
Glenn Greenwald's behavior, selecting a few of Snowden's documents to
publish and burying the rest, is consistent with this model.  So too is

Google's search engine, for instance, delivers results biased to comply
with the known interests and beliefs of individual users.  The profiles
used for this process are developed from very extensive user
surveillance; over 90% of a typical user's network activity is visible
to Google through these vectors:
- Google Analytics ("free" traffic analysis for website owners)
- Google Ads (plus DoubleClick and others Google has absorbed)
- GMail (including traffic to and from GMail users by non-users)
- Ubiquitous G+ "Like This Page" buttons on 3rd party websites
The Facebook is in the same business, continually updating its profiles
of all account holders, which are used to target advertising /and/ to
build user engagement by presenting a mixture of both bias confirming
and offensive content from "friends" and "friends of friends."  From
time to time I have had access to other users' Facebook accounts and
what I have seen is somewhat disconcerting:  A completely different
"world" is presented to users with significantly different personal
histories, interests and biases.
In addition to every mouse click and keystroke entered on The Facebook's
own site, their "Like This Page" buttons infest 3rd party websites, each
a surveillance beacon phoning home to report the arrival time, identity
and (probably) departure time of every visitor who does not use
countermeasures to prevent it.  I have not reviewed The Facebook's terms
of service lately, but initially this document asserted the users'
consent for intelligence gathering against them via 3rd party sources
including press notices, public records, data swaps with "partners" and

given away to anyone in the world at The Facebook's sole discretion.

economic policy.  But in a context where acquiring and preserving
power for its own sake by any means necessary is the only "ideology"
of an economic ruling class, the Left/Right divide is more a matter of
style than substance:  A basis for popularity contests among political
representatives of ruling class factions whose action agendas overlap
by 90% or more, in a context where public policy always serves the
entire ruling class at everyone else's expense.  I call Left/Right
Identity Politics a "divide the conquered" strategy.

Cryptography is a tool, not a magic cure-all.  There is a time and
place to lock adversaries out of your comms channels, and a time and
place to be very visible.  To tell the difference on a case by case
basis, ask yourself:  "Does my use of wide open public comms do more
harm to my interests or to those of my adversaries?"  It's a piss poor
pitiful Anarchist, who refuses to use an adversary's infrastructure to
harm that adversary's interests.
Those who insist on trying to conceal their identities and/or
activities from hostile actors at all times take themselves out of the
influence game.  If you have a protocol for broadcasting a persistent,
responsive, influential political message without being identified by
well funded surveillance actors, do please share it:  That would be a
fundamental and unexpected breakthrough.  Otherwise, such an effort
only starts a count-down timer - when will a well funded surveillance
actor take the trouble to find out who you are, and trace your
movements backward through time?  When they do so, which of the
actions you took because you believed they were "off the record" will
justify the allocation of billable hours to shut you down?
Judging by the "social media" channels, practically no one is content;
nearly everyone seems to believe that their ideological adversaries
are presently in power and need to be stomped down.  I see more people
who either call themselves "revolutionaries" or publicly bemoan the
fact that there "are no revolutionaries" all the time lately.  Of
course, they don't know what the word means - they accept self
defeating definitions provided to them by a lifetime of exposure to
revolutionary propaganda.
As expected, the Internet does amplify human intelligence and
mobilizes distributed "smart mobs" in response to perceived problems
and challenges.  But the Internet also amplifies human stupidity, and
some factions among our rulers have learned how to raise armies of
morons in cyberspace.  The result is a hotly contested information
battle space where multiple factions compete to influence both
ephemeral swarms and more durable herd movements.  I have never seen
anything like the intensity and variety of influence and
disinformation projects in progress right now in U.S. broadcast and
online media.
As expected, the future arrives sooner every day as the rate of change
continues to accelerate.  I see signs of panic and/or desperation
everywhere I look at any well established economic power block's
publicly visible activities.  What if there was a revolution and
nobody noticed?  The answer to that question is all around us right now.
You say you want a revolution?  Congratulations!  Radical changes in
the physical world - economic, technological and geophysical - are now
rendering previously stable political systems obsolete and
unmaintainable.  New institutional templates adapted to new conditions
emerge because people adapt their social and economic behavior to new
conditions; not because Great Visionary Leaders issue a call to arms.
 The political agitation and violence we call a "revolution" is only
the last stage of the actual revolutionary process, terminating it and
establishing a new institutional stability for the benefit of a new
set of power players.
We all want to change the world.  But if you have a real solution, we
all need to see the plan.  Restricting its distribution to "secure and
anonymous" channels only guarantees it won't reach an audience that
can implement it.  Where and as surprise actions provide strategic
advantage, do use cryptographic technology - IF your co-conspirators
are also up to it, which almost never happens in real life.  When
physical meetings where all electronics are banned are practical, they
can facilitate useful goal setting, coordination and planning.  The
surveillance networks will follow most of your group to and from the
meeting place, but otherwise moles and unwitting informants will be
the only security risks affecting the meeting itself.
A proposed revolution in communications security that would have
blinded State and Corporate actors to "private" network comms never
got off the ground and so could be said to have failed.  But a real,
naturally occurring revolution is in progress anyway:  Come back in 50
years and you will hardly know the place.

So whatever they are hiding is probably not this:
"The FBI used a vulnerability in Firefox 17, on which the Tor browser
is based, to turn Freedom Hosting sites into malware spreading tracker
tools. It all works on the Firefox 17 JavaScript Zero Day Exploit;
this malicious script is a tiny Windows executable hidden variable
named “Magneto” which looks for victim’s MAC address and its hostname
and sends it back as a HTTP web request to the Virginia server to
expose the user’s real IP address. The FBI successfully gained access
to the Freedom Hosting server and injected malicious HTML code, which
checks whether the user’s browser is Firefox 17 or not."
Which raises the question, what ARE they hiding?  Some options, in no
particular order...
1)  An as-yet undetected and unpatched vulnerability affecting Firefox
and/or the TOR router was used - and the defense team knows it.
2)  The defendant may have traded some information or cooperation, or
may have an "insurance file" with enough evidence to convict someone
at FBI or DOJ of his same charges or worse.
3)  The FBI decided to pick one suspect to kick loose with a bogus
story indicating an as-yet undetected and unpatched vulnerability, for
propaganda purposes.

Good point:  I was mostly serious, though of course I would never
imagine that clandestine security services "obey the law" just because
it's the law - the reason they are "clandestine" is to enable them to
break the law at will.  The FBI and the military intelligence services
have traditionally been rivals, very protective of the boundaries
defining their respective turfs.  But now that the FBI enforces U.S.
law against foreign nationals on foreign soil - a rather bizarre
development - it is easy to imagine that mechanisms for routine
integration of FBI and NSA functions have developed.
The example above - NSA and DEA working hand in hand - may not be the
most relevant indicator though.  Back when Phil Agee went walkabout
and wrote Inside The Company, there was a firestorm of controversy and
Congress yanked the CIA's leash hard by slashing budgets for U.S.
terrorist operations in South and Central America.  At that time the
DEA stepped in and took up the slack, as it was well positioned to
bypass Congress and fund its own operations by dealing drugs.  Since
the 1970s the DEA has been ass deep in political warfare overseas, so

This news is nearly 40 years old and to me, not very interesting
because I already know way too much about it.  Suggested lines of
inquiry:  How much of the reported results and subsequent funding of
CIA sponsored psychic research was done with an eye to prompting
other, less well funded intelligence services overseas to expend
resources attempting to duplicate the reported results?  How much of
the publicity surrounding these projects was intended to support
influence operations targeting superstitious foreign leaders and
populations?  And how much was a straight up scam raiding Uncle Sam's

view than Einstein's in business?

determination to endorse the experimentation as valid or invalid,
[but] it does find that continued activity in this field may offer
promise in applications to intelligence problems.” Therefore,
Congressman Rose was scheduling a briefing from Doctors Puthoff and
Targ, who were involved in the project."
Puthoff and Targ were celebrities in the paranormal and pop psychology
press at the time, "almost as if" publicity was their principal
occupation.  In the area of psychic research, they endorsed Israeli
stage magician Uri Geller's effects, often accomplished through the
agency of Geller's assistant who was allowed free run of the facility
where the "tests" were conducted, as demonstrations of genuine
telekinesis and ESP.  The facility in question was the Stanford
Research Institute, a CIA front located in Menlo Park, California.
The Stanford Research Institute also produced a remarkably influential
document called A Course In Miracles, the de facto Bible of the New
Age movement in the 1980s and 90s.  ACIM presents as a giant circular
argument persuasively selling the proposition that the reader is alone
in an otherwise empty Universe, and that all of her experiences are

Hash: SHA1
Perhaps "no" was shorthand for, "The widely repeated assertion that
Russia penetrated the DNC's mail servers and gave their contents to
Wikileaks is an obvious lie."
Why obvious?
The Russian Hacking claim was first made in an October, 2016 press
release from DHS that attributes it to "the USIC."  No less an
Independent Security Authority than Bruce Schneier has asserted that
the public was not told about Russian Hacking until /after/ the
election, in support of his position that the story was not intended
to affect U.S. election results.  How deep does this bullshit go?
"All the way down" apparently.
Since there is no such agency or department as "the United States
Intelligence Community," that means the content of the initial press
release is not attributable to any auditable process or responsible
party.  Worse, it does not actually say "Russia did it."  Instead it
says that the leak was consistent with Russia's motives and methods.
That's all it actually says, but it says that in a context where an
uncritical reader can have no doubt that it said "Russia did it and we
have proof."  The rest of the press release is a lengthy statement
assuring us that Russia, despite its digital superpowers, can not
alter the actual election results.
A second, post-election press release makes more detailed assertions,
and presents graphics depicting information about "hacking groups,"
already available to the public, to support the belief that "we know
all the details about how Russia did it."  Nothing connects these
completely generic diagrams to the DNC servers - but "seeing is
believing" and plenty of people do believe.
A third and even more lengthy and elaborate press release falsely
calls itself a declassified intelligence report.  I say "falsely"
because it bears no classification or distribution markings, no
declassification notice, and no redaction markings.  This very
jargon-dense fake intelligence report reiterates previously made
assertions in Hollywood style spook-speak obviously calculated to
confuse and impress a naive audience.
We are consistently told that the red hot smoking gun evidence that
proves Russia Did It can not be released to the public because it is
Top Secret.  Presumably, releasing any evidence at all would
compromise sensitive methods and sources.  But...  News flash:  When
you tell the opposition what you know and when you knew it, you have
already compromised your sensitive sources and methods.  Meanwhile,
when an intelligence service creates a 100% convincing impression that
it is waging political warfare against its domestic audience through
Big Lie propaganda, the resulting loss of confidence and prestige does
more damage to The National Security than the release of /one/
fragment of evidence in support of the propaganda narrative could
possibly do.
There's an old political slogan used by resistance movements:  "The
whole world is watching."  We can update that today:  "The whole world
is laughing."  And not just at the illiterate buffon in the Oval
Office:  The NeoLiberal DNC and its partisans at CIA are equally
laughable thanks to their grim determination to keep pushing their
favorite Big Lie narrative, as if there was no other grounds to
demonize the illiterate buffoon's Administration.
That's dangerously close to the classic propaganda technique called
Argument From Ignorance:  "Your failure to prove me wrong, proves me
right."  Not quite that, but dangerously close.

In real world voluntary organizations, the 10-90 rule is a pretty
reliable estimator:  10% of the participants do 90% of the work.
Among the 10%, a few individuals settle into a habit of doing each of

in social contexts.  About ten years ago there were some press notices
of psychological studies confirming a model where Liberal and

This evaluation of Left and Right Identity Politics may not make sense
to some people, especially those who have been sold the Left/Right
conflict as some kind of "ideological battle" based on the validity or
utility of political and economic theories, and believe the outcomes
of such debates in the public sphere affect State political and
economic policy.  But in a context where acquiring and preserving
power for its own sake by any means necessary is the only "ideology"
of an economic ruling class, the Left/Right divide is more a matter of
style than substance:  A basis for popularity contests among political
representatives of ruling class factions whose action agendas overlap
by 90% or more, in a context where public policy always serves the
entire ruling class at everyone else's expense.  I call Left/Right
Identity Politics a "divide the conquered" strategy.

Cryptography is a tool, not a magic cure-all.  There is a time and
place to lock adversaries out of your comms channels, and a time and
place to be very visible.  To tell the difference on a case by case
basis, ask yourself:  "Does my use of wide open public comms do more
harm to my interests or to those of my adversaries?"  It's a piss poor
pitiful Anarchist, who refuses to use an adversary's infrastructure to
harm that adversary's interests.
Those who insist on trying to conceal their identities and/or
activities from hostile actors at all times take themselves out of the
influence game.  If you have a protocol for broadcasting a persistent,
responsive, influential political message without being identified by
well funded surveillance actors, do please share it:  That would be a
fundamental and unexpected breakthrough.  Otherwise, such an effort
only starts a count-down timer - when will a well funded surveillance
actor take the trouble to find out who you are, and trace your
movements backward through time?  When they do so, which of the
actions you took because you believed they were "off the record" will
justify the allocation of billable hours to shut you down?
Judging by the "social media" channels, practically no one is content;
nearly everyone seems to believe that their ideological adversaries
are presently in power and need to be stomped down.  I see more people
who either call themselves "revolutionaries" or publicly bemoan the
fact that there "are no revolutionaries" all the time lately.  Of
course, they don't know what the word means - they accept self
defeating definitions provided to them by a lifetime of exposure to
revolutionary propaganda.
As expected, the Internet does amplify human intelligence and
mobilizes distributed "smart mobs" in response to perceived problems
and challenges.  But the Internet also amplifies human stupidity, and
some factions among our rulers have learned how to raise armies of
morons in cyberspace.  The result is a hotly contested information
battle space where multiple factions compete to influence both
ephemeral swarms and more durable herd movements.  I have never seen
anything like the intensity and variety of influence and
disinformation projects in progress right now in U.S. broadcast and
online media.
As expected, the future arrives sooner every day as the rate of change
continues to accelerate.  I see signs of panic and/or desperation
everywhere I look at any well established economic power block's
publicly visible activities.  What if there was a revolution and
nobody noticed?  The answer to that question is all around us right now.
You say you want a revolution?  Congratulations!  Radical changes in
the physical world - economic, technological and geophysical - are now
rendering previously stable political systems obsolete and
unmaintainable.  New institutional templates adapted to new conditions
emerge because people adapt their social and economic behavior to new
conditions; not because Great Visionary Leaders issue a call to arms.
 The political agitation and violence we call a "revolution" is only
the last stage of the actual revolutionary process, terminating it and
establishing a new institutional stability for the benefit of a new
set of power players.
We all want to change the world.  But if you have a real solution, we
all need to see the plan.  Restricting its distribution to "secure and
anonymous" channels only guarantees it won't reach an audience that
can implement it.  Where and as surprise actions provide strategic
advantage, do use cryptographic technology - IF your co-conspirators
are also up to it, which almost never happens in real life.  When
physical meetings where all electronics are banned are practical, they
can facilitate useful goal setting, coordination and planning.  The
surveillance networks will follow most of your group to and from the
meeting place, but otherwise moles and unwitting informants will be
the only security risks affecting the meeting itself.
A proposed revolution in communications security that would have
blinded State and Corporate actors to "private" network comms never
got off the ground and so could be said to have failed.  But a real,
naturally occurring revolution is in progress anyway:  Come back in 50
years and you will hardly know the place.

So whatever they are hiding is probably not this:
"The FBI used a vulnerability in Firefox 17, on which the Tor browser
is based, to turn Freedom Hosting sites into malware spreading tracker
tools. It all works on the Firefox 17 JavaScript Zero Day Exploit;
this malicious script is a tiny Windows executable hidden variable
named “Magneto” which looks for victim’s MAC address and its hostname
and sends it back as a HTTP web request to the Virginia server to
expose the user’s real IP address. The FBI successfully gained access
to the Freedom Hosting server and injected malicious HTML code, which
checks whether the user’s browser is Firefox 17 or not."
Which raises the question, what ARE they hiding?  Some options, in no
particular order...
1)  An as-yet undetected and unpatched vulnerability affecting Firefox
and/or the TOR router was used - and the defense team knows it.
2)  The defendant may have traded some information or cooperation, or
may have an "insurance file" with enough evidence to convict someone
at FBI or DOJ of his same charges or worse.
3)  The FBI decided to pick one suspect to kick loose with a bogus
story indicating an as-yet undetected and unpatched vulnerability, for
propaganda purposes.

Good point:  I was mostly serious, though of course I would never
imagine that clandestine security services "obey the law" just because
it's the law - the reason they are "clandestine" is to enable them to
break the law at will.  The FBI and the military intelligence services
have traditionally been rivals, very protective of the boundaries
defining their respective turfs.  But now that the FBI enforces U.S.
law against foreign nationals on foreign soil - a rather bizarre
development - it is easy to imagine that mechanisms for routine
integration of FBI and NSA functions have developed.
The example above - NSA and DEA working hand in hand - may not be the
most relevant indicator though.  Back when Phil Agee went walkabout
and wrote Inside The Company, there was a firestorm of controversy and
Congress yanked the CIA's leash hard by slashing budgets for U.S.
terrorist operations in South and Central America.  At that time the
DEA stepped in and took up the slack, as it was well positioned to
bypass Congress and fund its own operations by dealing drugs.  Since
the 1970s the DEA has been ass deep in political warfare overseas, so
I think it is reasonable to presume that they have a long standing BFF
relationship with both CIA and NSA.
FBI?  Maybe, maybe not, but on reflection I do think it's likely that
barriers between that organization and NSA etc. are falling fast, if

says that the leak was consistent with Russia's motives and methods.
That's all it actually says, but it says that in a context where an
uncritical reader can have no doubt that it said "Russia did it and we
have proof."  The rest of the press release is a lengthy statement
assuring us that Russia, despite its digital superpowers, can not
alter the actual election results.
A second, post-election press release makes more detailed assertions,
and presents graphics depicting information about "hacking groups,"
already available to the public, to support the belief that "we know
all the details about how Russia did it."  Nothing connects these
completely generic diagrams to the DNC servers - but "seeing is
believing" and plenty of people do believe.
A third and even more lengthy and elaborate press release falsely
calls itself a declassified intelligence report.  I say "falsely"
because it bears no classification or distribution markings, no
declassification notice, and no redaction markings.  This very
jargon-dense fake intelligence report reiterates previously made
assertions in Hollywood style spook-speak obviously calculated to
confuse and impress a naive audience.
We are consistently told that the red hot smoking gun evidence that
proves Russia Did It can not be released to the public because it is
Top Secret.  Presumably, releasing any evidence at all would
compromise sensitive methods and sources.  But...  News flash:  When
you tell the opposition what you know and when you knew it, you have
already compromised your sensitive sources and methods.  Meanwhile,
when an intelligence service creates a 100% convincing impression that
it is waging political warfare against its domestic audience through
Big Lie propaganda, the resulting loss of confidence and prestige does
more damage to The National Security than the release of /one/
fragment of evidence in support of the propaganda narrative could
possibly do.
There's an old political slogan used by resistance movements:  "The
whole world is watching."  We can update that today:  "The whole world
is laughing."  And not just at the illiterate buffon in the Oval
Office:  The NeoLiberal DNC and its partisans at CIA are equally
laughable thanks to their grim determination to keep pushing their
favorite Big Lie narrative, as if there was no other grounds to
demonize the illiterate buffoon's Administration.
That's dangerously close to the classic propaganda technique called
Argument From Ignorance:  "Your failure to prove me wrong, proves me
right."  Not quite that, but dangerously close.

The global Superstate scenario is "real" in the sense that many people
actually seem to believe in it, approve of it and want to make it
happen.  Such is the power of propaganda in the age of ubiquitous
broadcast communications, moving whole societies into fantasy worlds
designed to facilitate economic growth under a top-down command
The Superstate scenario is "real" in the metaphorical sense that the
Internet, trans-national corporations and high speed long distance
transport of materials and consumer goods have already turned Homo Sap
into a meta-organism that behaves like a colonial fungus bent on
consuming the world's resources as quickly and completely as possible.
But the prospect of world peace and prosperity under a benevolent
global State is "not real at all" in the sense that the global
industrial economy is locked into self-destructive feedback loops
driven by perverse incentives.  Any Utopian plan that does not take
the context of a global economic collapse and human population crash
into account is a futile exercise in abstract speculation.
We are now inside the historical singularity:  A system where the
exponential growth rate of change in human affairs (new discoveries,
technologies, etc.) has advanced too far to permit reliable long range
projections of future developments.  The rate of ongoing change is too
high, creating too many hidden variables and too much turbulence.
Under these conditions, even brute force solutions that seek to

The only things we can predict with much confidence today are that the

scale human motives and behaviors that have not changed over the last
few thousand years will likely change slowly if at all.  Given these
baseline factors, we /can/ predict, with some confidence, that we will
be dropping out of the singularity soon:  Macro scale human demand for
basic material commodities (including food) now exceeds the planet's

What I call the Scientician faith is a very widespread popular
religion, maybe the first really successful atheist religious sect.
In the U.S. its followers number in the tens of millions and include
most self identifying "Liberals" as well as numerous "Libertarians"
and others who pin a large part of their self esteem on the notion
that they are "smarter" than other people.  The Scientician priesthood
- - everyone who claims the title "scientist" and is available through
speakers' bureaus and press agents - replaces the functions of the
Church as "explainer of everything" and "Voice of Divine Authority."
The apocalyptic prophesy I refer to is more or less the same scenario
I outlined earlier:  The impact of resource depletion, environmental
degradation, population pressure etc. on human affairs in the next
couple of decades.
There is a sharp divide between the scientists and Scienticians over
what the outcome will be:  A broad consensus among working scientists
in relevant fields says "life as we know it" will be ending shortly;
massive losses are inevitable; and immediate, radical remedial action
is warranted.
But our Scienticians are happy to promote the belief that by throwing
enough money at the symptoms when they become too severe to ignore,
all the problems arising from the Industrial Revolution can be solved
to everyone's satisfaction by Startling Miracles of Super Science.
The Scientician position has practical consequences:  It maximizes
Corporate executive compensation packages, Corporate shareholder
capital gains, and both poverty and human fatalities among the "lower

The State fully endorses the Scientician approach, as the State's sole
function is to transfer money and power from the poor to the rich at
the fastest practicable rate.  As always, symbolic "initiatives" and
strongly worded press releases are sufficient responses to public
pressure to "do something" about, for instance, global warming.
When our propaganda industries co-opted the image of science as a
marketing tool, this already complex and contentious field of human

I think of Snowden as victim of circumstances controlled by others,
and very possibly an unwitting agent selected from a pool of
candidates provided by the Insider Threat Program.  Am I the only one
who has noticed that every real-world consequence of The Snowden
Affair has benefited his former employers?
Snowden's freedom of action ended when he handed Glen Greenwald a
collection of documents that brought in $250 million when Greenwald
shopped them around.  From that time forward Ed has been a prisoner in
a portable cage, because for reasons known only to himself he decided
to sign his name vs. concealing his identity.  Lest we forget, Chelsea
Manning was only busted because she said too much to a snitch - and Ed
certainly knew that.
The first thing the Snowden docs were used for was to open up NSA
domestic network surveillance as an issue for Congress to settle.
They did so by allowing it to continue, and in the process established
that lying to Congress under oath is not a crime if the DCI does it.
There are huge advantages in picking the time and place of a fight in
advance and preparing in depth before making "the other guy" start it.
The second thing the Snowden docs were used for was to keep the
Manning trial out of the news.  Greenwald reportedly fought with his
editors to move the publication date up to coincide with the first day
of Manning's trial.  They did so and the result was "Chelsea who?  Oh,
that's over and done with ages ago."
The only real damage the Snowden Docs did to State interests was not
done by them at all:  The popular press falsely attributes leaked NSA
docs originating in Germany, i.e. the one that revealed Merkel's
phones were tapped, to Snowden.

The question "Can such attacks be prevented by technological measures

operating systems and the problem goes away.
Microsoft could fix their horribly broken product any time, but they
never will:  Maintaining the highest rates of failure, repair and
replacement the market will bear creates a large revenue stream that
would not otherwise exist.  Security failure is the best approach:
Loyal Microsoft customers attribute the damage done to malicious third
parties, and the process of repairing that damage creates a
multi-million dollar bump in annual sales for Microsoft.
There will always be "security issues" in networked computing.  But at
least 95% of real world lost time and lost data incidents observed today
have a single and easily remedied cause:  Microsoft.

that's the only block that really works.  Microsoft security fail
imposes either a large amount of busy work and extra costs on the user,
or exposes the user to unacceptable risks.  That's a lose/lose
situation, whether one is a Security Guru or clueless user.

On screen, John Drake, played by Patrick McGoohan, was the guy:  His
doings were much more realistic than Bond's, with assignments including
counter-espionage, political interventions in post-colonial nations, and
some missions bordering on international law enforcement.  He battled no
super-villains, seduced no glamorous women, and always preferred
strategic deception to ultra-violence:  "I never carry a gun.  They're
noisy and they hurt people.  Besides, I do very well without."
The fanciest gadgets Drake had were micro-miniature tap recorders and
cameras, and variously camouflaged dart guns for delivering microphones
to hard to reach locations.
Danger Man producer Ralph Smart and the writing staff did their homework
and kept the stories as realistic as a 1960 action/adventure TV show
could be.  So did Patrick McGoohan, who turned down the role of James
Bond when approached by Eon Productions.  That was Sean Connery's big break.
During the production of Danger Man (released as Secret Agent in the
U.S.), McGoohan demanded and got significant creative control, insisting
on the "no gun" thing, the "no sex" thing, and that fight scenes be
(relatively) realistic and "always different."
Today the John Drake is better known as Number Six.  For licensing
reasons, McGoohan & co. insisted that the prisoner in The Prisoner was
not Drake.  But in the series finale, Number Two calls him John - just
once, and it's easy to miss.
There's a moral to the Danger Man / Prisoner story:  Study espionage
long enough and you will conclude that there is nothing admirable or
romantic about it:  It's a thoroughly vicious trade that eats its own
best people alive.  At least that's my take-away from the Danger Man /
Prisoner story arc.  McGoohan isn't around to ask, and probably wouldn't
give a straight answer if he was.  He was always very forthcoming about
technical aspects of the production, fun and games with cast members,
etc., but pointedly evaded the question of what The Prisoner was all
"Questions are a burden to others, answers a prison for oneself."

My take-away from having just watched the film:
In Risk, Poitras burns Jacob Applebaum by presenting accusations against
him with no mention of the content or context of those accusations.  Nor
is there any mention of dissenting voices from within the TOR Project
itself regarding the libelous JakeGate narrative, or the toxic TOR
Project workplace environment.  In the wake of the organized online
assault against Applebaum led by fellow employees, the TOR Project has
replaced its board of directors and moved offices across the country in
an apparent effort to clean house.
In the film, Poitras states that she has personal knowledge confirming
that Applebaum is a Bad Person, with no mention of specific incidents or
sources:  She essentially says that she has heard gossip.  Apparently
that's all the proof a fearless crusading journalist needs.  Maybe she
has a problem with the Feminist Thing, Male Pigs etc.; I also noted that
the film makes no mention of the alleged victim of Julian Assange who
has very publicly stated that he did not assault her in any way.
In the film, Poitras fully endorses and actively propagandizes the
Russian Hacking narrative.  She could not have produced a more
persuasive Public Information announcement if it had been written and
directed by whatever compartments at CIA and DOJ are responsible to sell
it to the public.
The very newsworthy and /anomalous/ $20k reward offered by Assange for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever shot Seth
Rich in the back is not mentioned in the film.  In this film Poitras
does not question the identity of the DNC leaker; the Director of the

detailed history of the CIA from 1947 through 1972, the only text of its
Page 230:
"It was necessary for the CIA to arrange for aircraft to enter the
country quite frequently without the usual customs check that all
military aircraft must undergo. In the earlier years the CIA would
arrange directly or through State or Defense to have customs waive
inspection of a plane with classified cargo or carrying a defector or on
some other highly classified mission. Then, when such things had become
more or less commonplace, the CIA would politely offer to provide a few
men to work with the regular customs personnel to take the burden for
such activity from them. This was the way it was put in the first place,
and the customs office would gratefully accept the assistance. The CIA
would go through all the necessary steps to get authorization for
increasing the manpower allocations in the customs service by the number
of men it planned to put there and then to make arrangements to
reimburse the customs office for the payroll and other costs of the office.
This latter step would always be taken, because it would be best for the
customs office to go through all of the normal motions of paying these
men, including promoting them and paying for their travel or other usual
expenses, so that their assignment would appear to be completely normal
to all others in the office. Then, by special accounting procedures that
would take place in the main office, the CIA would reimburse the
Treasury Department for the money involved.
In the beginning this would all be done with elaborate open-handedness,
even to the point where the new agency men would receive training and
other prerequisites of the job. However, as the years passed, most of
this procedure would be forgotten, and few would recall that those
special assignments had even originated with the Agency. Accountants who
had known how to transfer the funds would have been transferred
themselves, and the Treasury Department might no longer bill for the
costs involved. But the Agency men would stay on, their replacements
would be carefully fitted into the manning tables, and few would even
notice that they were there.
This has happened quite extensively in a great many places all
throughout the Government. There are CIA men in the Federal Aviation
Administration, in State, all over the DOD, and in most other offices
where the CIA has wanted to place them. Few top officials, if any, would
ever deny the Agency such a service; and as the appointive official
departed, and his staffs came and went, the whole device would be lost
with only the CIA remembering that they were still there.
Many of these people have reached positions of great responsibility. I
believe that the most powerful and certainly the most useful agent the
CIA has ever had operates in just such a capacity within another branch
of the Government, and he has been there for so long that few have any
idea that he is a long-term career agent of the CIA. Through his most
excellent and skillful services, more CIA operations have been enabled
to take place than can be laid at the feet of any other, more
"legitimate" agent.
This was the plan and the wisdom of the Dulles idea from the beginning.
On the basis of security he would place people in all areas of the
Government, and then he would move them up and deeper into their cover
jobs, until they began to take a very active part in the role of their
own cover organizations. This is how the ST was born. Today, the role of
the CIA is performed by an ad hoc organization that is much greater in
size, strength, and resources than the CIA has ever been visualized to be.

A much more economical attack where seed boxes operated by hostile

The most successful governments in history, from a quality of life and
durability perspective, organized as bands > tribes > federations,
governed by consensus-driven local councils.  There was no "Sovereign"
in sight, no presumption that the collective owns its members or their
supposedly personal property.  Nor did designated decision-makers have
the authority to enforce their orders by violent means.

The global Superstate scenario is "real" in the sense that many people
actually seem to believe in it, approve of it and want to make it
happen.  Such is the power of propaganda in the age of ubiquitous
broadcast communications, moving whole societies into fantasy worlds
designed to facilitate economic growth under a top-down command
The Superstate scenario is "real" in the metaphorical sense that the
Internet, trans-national corporations and high speed long distance
transport of materials and consumer goods have already turned Homo Sap
into a meta-organism that behaves like a colonial fungus bent on
consuming the world's resources as quickly and completely as possible.
But the prospect of world peace and prosperity under a benevolent
global State is "not real at all" in the sense that the global
industrial economy is locked into self-destructive feedback loops
driven by perverse incentives.  Any Utopian plan that does not take
the context of a global economic collapse and human population crash
into account is a futile exercise in abstract speculation.
We are now inside the historical singularity:  A system where the
exponential growth rate of change in human affairs (new discoveries,
technologies, etc.) has advanced too far to permit reliable long range
projections of future developments.  The rate of ongoing change is too
high, creating too many hidden variables and too much turbulence.
Under these conditions, even brute force solutions that seek to
will not yield reliable results.
The only things we can predict with much confidence today are that the
better established laws of physics will remain intact, and that macro
scale human motives and behaviors that have not changed over the last
few thousand years will likely change slowly if at all.  Given these
baseline factors, we /can/ predict, with some confidence, that we will
be dropping out of the singularity soon:  Macro scale human demand for
basic material commodities (including food) now exceeds the planet's
carrying capacity; that demand is still growing, while the rate of
resource exhaustion and human habitat destruction continues to accelerat
The Scientician faith and its Corporate Capitalist patrons tell us
that technological "quick fix" solutions will be created when and as
needed to keep the world as we know it intact.  Like all respectable
apocalyptic prophesies, those of the Scienticians are likely to be
reasonably accurate right up to the point where the Heavens open up
and Bog and all his Holy Angels come down and fix everything for us:
That part never happens.
I do not advise people to "give up" on anything but the status quo,
and I do not predict the extinction of the human species.  We are the
toughest weeds Nature ever made, capable of living on pack ice and
hard rock desert using only Neolithic technology - and loving it.  I
do suggest that those who are able to do so get to work devising
practical solutions for survival and recovery to the best available
New Normal.  The world's present rulers are hard at work on those
problems right now, but their objectives center on worst case
scenarios where retaining their present level of power is the primary
objective, and everyone but themselves is expendable.  Pardon my

What I call the Scientician faith is a very widespread popular
religion, maybe the first really successful atheist religious sect.
In the U.S. its followers number in the tens of millions and include
most self identifying "Liberals" as well as numerous "Libertarians"
and others who pin a large part of their self esteem on the notion
that they are "smarter" than other people.  The Scientician priesthood
- - everyone who claims the title "scientist" and is available through
speakers' bureaus and press agents - replaces the functions of the
Church as "explainer of everything" and "Voice of Divine Authority."
The apocalyptic prophesy I refer to is more or less the same scenario
I outlined earlier:  The impact of resource depletion, environmental
degradation, population pressure etc. on human affairs in the next
couple of decades.
There is a sharp divide between the scientists and Scienticians over
what the outcome will be:  A broad consensus among working scientists
in relevant fields says "life as we know it" will be ending shortly;
massive losses are inevitable; and immediate, radical remedial action
is warranted.
But our Scienticians are happy to promote the belief that by throwing
enough money at the symptoms when they become too severe to ignore,
all the problems arising from the Industrial Revolution can be solved
to everyone's satisfaction by Startling Miracles of Super Science.
The Scientician position has practical consequences:  It maximizes
Corporate executive compensation packages, Corporate shareholder
capital gains, and both poverty and human fatalities among the "lower
classes" worldwide:  It's a win/win/win proposition from our rulers'
The State fully endorses the Scientician approach, as the State's sole
function is to transfer money and power from the poor to the rich at
the fastest practicable rate.  As always, symbolic "initiatives" and
strongly worded press releases are sufficient responses to public
pressure to "do something" about, for instance, global warming.
When our propaganda industries co-opted the image of science as a
marketing tool, this already complex and contentious field of human
activity became a /real/ hairball.  Almost nobody who lacks formal
training in the physical sciences stands any chance of understanding,
much less evaluating, claims made In The Name Of Science today.

I think of Snowden as victim of circumstances controlled by others,
and very possibly an unwitting agent selected from a pool of
candidates provided by the Insider Threat Program.  Am I the only one
who has noticed that every real-world consequence of The Snowden
Affair has benefited his former employers?
Snowden's freedom of action ended when he handed Glen Greenwald a
collection of documents that brought in $250 million when Greenwald
shopped them around.  From that time forward Ed has been a prisoner in
a portable cage, because for reasons known only to himself he decided
to sign his name vs. concealing his identity.  Lest we forget, Chelsea
Manning was only busted because she said too much to a snitch - and Ed
certainly knew that.
The first thing the Snowden docs were used for was to open up NSA
domestic network surveillance as an issue for Congress to settle.
They did so by allowing it to continue, and in the process established
that lying to Congress under oath is not a crime if the DCI does it.
There are huge advantages in picking the time and place of a fight in
advance and preparing in depth before making "the other guy" start it.
The second thing the Snowden docs were used for was to keep the
Manning trial out of the news.  Greenwald reportedly fought with his
editors to move the publication date up to coincide with the first day
of Manning's trial.  They did so and the result was "Chelsea who?  Oh,
that's over and done with ages ago."
The only real damage the Snowden Docs did to State interests was not
done by them at all:  The popular press falsely attributes leaked NSA
docs originating in Germany, i.e. the one that revealed Merkel's
phones were tapped, to Snowden.

The question "Can such attacks be prevented by technological measures
alone" has a very simple answer: Yes.  Just stop using Microsoft
operating systems and the problem goes away.
Microsoft could fix their horribly broken product any time, but they
never will:  Maintaining the highest rates of failure, repair and
replacement the market will bear creates a large revenue stream that
would not otherwise exist.  Security failure is the best approach:
Loyal Microsoft customers attribute the damage done to malicious third
parties, and the process of repairing that damage creates a
multi-million dollar bump in annual sales for Microsoft.
There will always be "security issues" in networked computing.  But at
least 95% of real world lost time and lost data incidents observed today
have a single and easily remedied cause:  Microsoft.
Mr. Miyagi say, "Best block is no be there."  In the case at hand,
that's the only block that really works.  Microsoft security fail
imposes either a large amount of busy work and extra costs on the user,
or exposes the user to unacceptable risks.  That's a lose/lose
situation, whether one is a Security Guru or clueless user.
Now let's see who jumps in to defend Microsoft:  There's always somebody
out there who believes that "stupid people get what they deserve" and

On screen, John Drake, played by Patrick McGoohan, was the guy:  His
doings were much more realistic than Bond's, with assignments including
counter-espionage, political interventions in post-colonial nations, and
some missions bordering on international law enforcement.  He battled no
super-villains, seduced no glamorous women, and always preferred
strategic deception to ultra-violence:  "I never carry a gun.  They're
noisy and they hurt people.  Besides, I do very well without."
The fanciest gadgets Drake had were micro-miniature tap recorders and
cameras, and variously camouflaged dart guns for delivering microphones
to hard to reach locations.
Danger Man producer Ralph Smart and the writing staff did their homework
and kept the stories as realistic as a 1960 action/adventure TV show
could be.  So did Patrick McGoohan, who turned down the role of James
Bond when approached by Eon Productions.  That was Sean Connery's big break.
During the production of Danger Man (released as Secret Agent in the
U.S.), McGoohan demanded and got significant creative control, insisting
on the "no gun" thing, the "no sex" thing, and that fight scenes be
(relatively) realistic and "always different."
Today the John Drake is better known as Number Six.  For licensing
reasons, McGoohan & co. insisted that the prisoner in The Prisoner was
not Drake.  But in the series finale, Number Two calls him John - just
once, and it's easy to miss.
There's a moral to the Danger Man / Prisoner story:  Study espionage
long enough and you will conclude that there is nothing admirable or
romantic about it:  It's a thoroughly vicious trade that eats its own
best people alive.  At least that's my take-away from the Danger Man /
Prisoner story arc.  McGoohan isn't around to ask, and probably wouldn't
give a straight answer if he was.  He was always very forthcoming about
technical aspects of the production, fun and games with cast members,
etc., but pointedly evaded the question of what The Prisoner was all
"Questions are a burden to others, answers a prison for oneself."

My take-away from having just watched the film:
In Risk, Poitras burns Jacob Applebaum by presenting accusations against
him with no mention of the content or context of those accusations.  Nor
is there any mention of dissenting voices from within the TOR Project
itself regarding the libelous JakeGate narrative, or the toxic TOR
Project workplace environment.  In the wake of the organized online
assault against Applebaum led by fellow employees, the TOR Project has
replaced its board of directors and moved offices across the country in
an apparent effort to clean house.
In the film, Poitras states that she has personal knowledge confirming
that Applebaum is a Bad Person, with no mention of specific incidents or
sources:  She essentially says that she has heard gossip.  Apparently
that's all the proof a fearless crusading journalist needs.  Maybe she
has a problem with the Feminist Thing, Male Pigs etc.; I also noted that
the film makes no mention of the alleged victim of Julian Assange who
has very publicly stated that he did not assault her in any way.
In the film, Poitras fully endorses and actively propagandizes the
Russian Hacking narrative.  She could not have produced a more
persuasive Public Information announcement if it had been written and
directed by whatever compartments at CIA and DOJ are responsible to sell
it to the public.
The very newsworthy and /anomalous/ $20k reward offered by Assange for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of whoever shot Seth
Rich in the back is not mentioned in the film.  In this film Poitras
does not question the identity of the DNC leaker; the Director of the

they have been handed have ever been published.
Poitras is anything but a disinterested third party with regard to

Oops, I neglected to provide a link to The Secret Team.  It is kind of
hard to find.  This is surprising (or not) considering that it is a very
detailed history of the CIA from 1947 through 1972, the only text of its
Page 230:
"It was necessary for the CIA to arrange for aircraft to enter the
country quite frequently without the usual customs check that all
military aircraft must undergo. In the earlier years the CIA would
arrange directly or through State or Defense to have customs waive
inspection of a plane with classified cargo or carrying a defector or on
some other highly classified mission. Then, when such things had become
more or less commonplace, the CIA would politely offer to provide a few
men to work with the regular customs personnel to take the burden for
such activity from them. This was the way it was put in the first place,
and the customs office would gratefully accept the assistance. The CIA
would go through all the necessary steps to get authorization for
increasing the manpower allocations in the customs service by the number
of men it planned to put there and then to make arrangements to
reimburse the customs office for the payroll and other costs of the office.
This latter step would always be taken, because it would be best for the
customs office to go through all of the normal motions of paying these
men, including promoting them and paying for their travel or other usual
expenses, so that their assignment would appear to be completely normal
to all others in the office. Then, by special accounting procedures that

Now that's music to every clueless luser's ears:  "Don't waste a moment
of time or give up an inch of convenience for security, because there is
no such thing as security."  Not only does this justify the lusers'
categorical refusal to spend a moment of time or give up an inch of
convenience, it also assures them that they are /smarter/ than people
who do give a damn about network security.
Whether any given computer is fucked on a given day depends on many
factors.  Network security begins with a threat model:  Who might want
to steal or destroy your data, what resources do they have, and if an
adversary is successful what do you stand to lose?  Next look at the
methods for locking those particular adversaries out, and the cost in $$
and time for doing so:  Compare the price of a solid defense to the
value of what you are defending:  When it costs more to defend an asset
than it is worth, you lose.  When it costs less to defend an asset than
it is worth, you win.
It is almost always orders of magnitude easier and cheaper to defend a
computer than to attack one - IF one starts with tools that CAN be
secured, which rules out Microsoft operating systems and software.
Where and as security fail is unavoidable - i.e. your shop needs a
commercial software package that will not run on anything but a
Microsoft OS - the value of the work product will justify the costs
(including minor personal inconvenience) of properly quarantining the
machine(s) it lives on.  If not, you don't really need that work product
and the problem solves itself the cheap way:  "We stopped using that."
As a bonus, defending digital assets from one's "most serious"
adversaries will automatically defend those assets from lesser beings.
Perfect or absolute security does not exist because it can not exist:
But almost anyone can afford a good enough security model to reduce the
odds of serious security incidents per decade from near certainty to a
low single digit percentage.

Sure, they will be able to exercise their power /during/ the collapse to
hoard food and trade goods, and will field private armies under whatever
banner of Good Old Days authority suits their fancy.  But their reach
will be very limited and they will face a few little problems:  Raiding
by other ex-rulers, attrition from insurrections and desertions, and of
course, a few little problems from independent gangs of peasants who
don't appreciate it when the little they have is threatened by gangs
employed by their ex-rulers.

Around 1970 the Post-WWII economic boom started to flatten out, due to
market saturation - everyone with money to spend was spending it as fast
as they ever would.  Production costs also started to rise due to
resource depletion - the cheapest, easiest to get high value materials
were used up and continued extraction at established rates started
costing more every year.  Alongside this, a tipping point in domestic
political warfare arrived and the last vestiges of actually Liberal
radicalism were successfully replaced with a set-piece war between
militant factions covertly developed by the State then very publicly
attacked by the same agencies that created them.
On the economic front a collective decision was taken by the U.S. ruling
class - one might more accurately say a mindless tropism was followed -
and emphasis shifted from real economic growth to looting as a method of
sustaining the profit margins and growth rates our rulers had become
accustomed to.  Around 1975 this started to show up in economic
statistics as continued growth in income for the top U.S. earners, with
"stagnant" a.k.a. frozen incomes for the lowest earners.  At the top end
of the scale, a mighty, towering peak concealed in aggregate statistics
for the "top 10%" kept rising like a rocket.
1980 saw the last nails driven into the coffin of the American Dream for
all but the top 15-20% of earners, with the installation of the Reagan
Administration and a formal national policy of redistribution of wealth
from the poor to the rich by means of "trickle down" a.k.a. "voodoo"

As an unwitting participant in either one of the last MKULTRA era
experiments, or an independent M.D.'s "good deed for the day," I have a
special relationship with LSD:  I got microdosed twice a week for six
weeks in 1972, and that experience went a long way toward making me
whatever the fuck I am today.  A few years later I thought I was taking
LSD for the first time... but then came the "Hello old friend!" moment.
Never underestimate the power of the psychedelics:  Our de facto masters
don't, and that is why LSD is on the very short list of illegal drugs
not readily available to anyone who goes looking.  Everybody who's hip
to the jive /says/ they can get acid, but ask if it's real and they look
at their shoes and mumble.  MDMA is the only other example that comes to
mind at the moment, and it is seriously prohibited for the same reasons
as LSD:  Its effect on the individual users' cognitive and emotional
development, and potential aggregate impact on social and political
norms, is Not Wanted:  Better every American who is willing and able
should be using heroin - which BTW is typically included in the fake
MDMA that is readily available everywhere in the U.S.
Once upon a time, a misplaced decimal point in a report received by the
CIA made it appear that the Soviet researchers had ordered hundreds of
thousands of doses of LSD from its sole source, Sandoz.  Nobody at CIA
had heard of LSD, but the literature indicated that it was believed to
have unique potentials for research and therapeutic purposes.  This made
the huge order from Russia look very significant.  The propaganda meme
of "Communist Brainwashing" was still current as an explanation for U.S.
prisoners in North Korea confessing to war crimes.  In a strange example
of blowback, this myth prompted the CIA to attempt to duplicate
"brainwashing" themselves.
In the 1950s, LSD was being studied by psychiatrists and psychologists
who believed it could produce breakthroughs in treatment of intractable
mental illnesses.  Russia's supposedly HUGE order for LSD made it appear
that they had found a very important practical application for it, maybe
even as a tool for "brainwashing."  So the CIA cut a deal with Sandoz:
They placed an even larger order themselves, as part of an agreement
that Sandoz would sell exclusively to the CIA.
This is how the MKULTRA we know and love was born.  The spooks were up
to their ears in acid and had no idea what it was for, so they started
giving LSD to a broad cross section of people in various situations just
to see what would happen, and unleashed all the Mad Scientists they
could interest in the subject with carte blanche to do whatever it took
to find out what LSD does and how to weaponize it.
It turned out that the only significant military application for LSD was
as a disabling agent producing temporary confusion, disorientation and
loss of focus on structured tasks.  Pharmacological research beginning
with the study of LSD eventually yielded a family of nerve agents that
produce instant, persistent paranoid psychosis: BZ, DZ and others which
are still in the inventories of various services.
Academics employed by the MKULTRA program through front organizations
included Tim Leary and Richard Alpert, who did the now classic studies
defining the "psychedelic effect."  Long story short, the LSD experience
can permanently affect a person's subjective frame of reference, moving
it in the direction of empathy, compassion and creativity.  Worst of
all, from an intelligence service viewpoint, LSD can cause indoctrinated
neurotic complexes to collapse "of their own accord."
So LSD turned out to be worse than useless to the CIA:  The psychedelic
effect works directly against the mission profile loosely described as
"brainwashing," at every scale from individual targets to whole national
populations.  By the mid-1960s a decision was taken to actively suppress
the use of LSD, and soon after batches of LSD poisoned with nerve agents
similar to those mentioned above made their way into underground supply
chains.  The full spectrum of domestic propaganda assets were engaged to
assure the successful demonization of LSD.  The last time I checked,
simple possession of LSD was a Federal felony carrying a minimum
mandatory 10 year prison sentence.
One should not over-estimate the beneficial impacts of LSD:  It is no
panacea.  Users whose "set and setting" for the LSD experience is
escapist thrill-seeking usually realize little or no measurable benefit,
no matter how much they use or how often.  But in the hands of people
already committed to self examination - or so oriented by structured
activities such as religious services or psychotherapy while "tripping"
- LSD works like dynamite:  It clears massive obstacles in one go.
Unlike dynamite, it does so safely then "plants your feet back firmly on
the ground."  But what has been seen can not be unseen, and once forced
open the doors of perception never quite completely close again.
Shamans, including the actual Siberian ones and the working mystics of
other "primitive" cultures, have understood and used the psychedelic
effect for as long as anything recognizable as religion has existed.
LSD only happens to be the all around best psychedelic drug discovered
to date.
The "great cultural revolution" of the 1960s was strongly influenced, if
not actually set in motion, by LSD.  Leary became an evangelist of a
sort, and systematically "turned on" as many influential people as he
could - actors, musicians, artists, writers, etc. - with an focus on
those who would best be able to spread the gospel of chemical liberation
to others in those trades.  He was not alone in this effort:  Sidney
Gottleib, the infamous founder of the MKULTRA program, took LSD
"hundreds of times" and personally recommended it to business and
political leaders as a performance enhancing drug.
If you want to promote peace, love. brotherhood, etc., you could do
worse than giving people some LSD to play with.  Example:
When a monkey gazes into a mirror, no wise philosopher looks back.  LSD
won't make an idiot into a genius, or (all by itself) turn a self
defeating neurotic personality around.  But by definition nobody has
ever been "hobbled" by psychedelics, and more than a few users have
found themselves looking at the shattered remnants of their own mental
and emotional chains lying on the ground, and walked away from them.

I saw it at a theater; a NamVet friend got a group together to go.  He
said something very much like that really happened, and I'm not inclined
to doubt it.
Back around 1979 or 80, one of my best friends and her son went stark
raving paranoid psychotic overnight.  Literally, they woke up insane,
closed the shop, boarded up their windows and prepared for the worst -
locked into a state of panic the whole time.
At that time, Carolyn was running a head shop near the University of
Central Florida, and a series of laws had recently been passed over the
course of a few months in an effort to shut down head shops in Florida,
with an apparent emphasis on hers:  The first to be raided on every day
the next law kicked in.  The other well known head shop in town was
never raided.  It did not open on the mornings of the raids, but some of
Carolyn's stock did appear on its shelves in the weeks following.
Also at that time, Lockheed Martin was building a missile plant less
than a mile down the road from Carolyn's head shop.  On the cross-corner
of the same intersection, a subdivision destined to house many of the
missile plant's employees broke ground.
Caroline never called her establishment an Infoshop, but it was exactly
that, loaded to the gunnels with anarchist literature and propaganda.
On slow days the stone gorgeous fucking brilliant hippie chick who ran
it was always happy to talk politics.  So, given Carolyn's location,
that store had to go.
Carolyn eventually recovered.  Her son did not.  In all fairness he was
starting to go nuts on his own - family history on his father's side -
but whatever nerve agent was used did him no favors either.
Every now and then when an "inconvenient" person kills themselves or
gets themselves shot, information on their behavior in the days leading
up to the event really does make me wonder.  Carolyn believed that she
was supposed to commit suicide, because someone had made it a point just
a couple of days earlier to assure that there would be a loaded gun in
the house.

I was told at the time that the medication in question contained a
"stimulant" and that it might make me feel "funny," but not to worry
about it, it would wear off in a few hours and I would eventually get
used to it.
I did not so much get used to it, as start really looking forward to it.
 When the second batch arrived, click, nothing.  No effect.
Along about that time I started to question literally everything,
including the nature of reality itself.  I can't say the experience
affected my core values - for instance I was already dead set against
war, regardless of excuses offered, and got in trouble from time to time
for not bothering to observe "color lines" on the playground etc.  But I
suspect the LSD did have a radicalizing effect, in the literal sense of
that word:  It directed my attention to the fundamentals that define a
person's life and the structure of events in the larger world.

Surveys of the literature have found no descriptions of "bad trips"
resulting from administration of LSD in a clinical setting, which
included subjects with diagnosed mental illnesses, and studies using
very large doses.  The classic "bad trip" first appeared in the wild
right on time to support the Federally sponsored full-saturation
domestic propaganda campaign against LSD.
Did the CIA murder Art Linkletter's daughter?  Maybe not her in
particular, on purpose.  But whoever made the alleged "LSD" she took
before diving out of a high window did. and her suicide was a huge
stroke of luck for the folks tasked to sell the public on a completely
false version of what LSD is and does.
When hearings were held to determine what schedule to put MDMA on,
clinical researchers who testified described it was uniquely useful;
they found it got stubbornly uncommunicative patients talking, and
enabled therapists to build useful rapport with them very quickly.
Their verdict was unanimous:  This is Good Shit, we wants it yes we
does.  Then the DEA guise gave their testimony, mostly a recitation of
War On Drugs propaganda talking points originally created for LSD, and
so MDMA was put on Schedule I.
MDMA has been described as an "empathogen," knocking down social anxiety
and replacing it, temporarily, with trust, confidence, and a (transient)
sense of strong social bonding with "just whoever happens to be there."
I speculate that the Feds chose to suppress MDMA both because of
unwanted macro scale social impacts, and because its obvious
intelligence tradecraft applications (elicitation of information, agent
development & recruitment) do not belong in "private" hands.
Today's "ecstasy" a.k.a. X contains no MDMA but typically does contain
amphetamine, heroin, and one or more "designer" drugs to tweak the
experience this way or that.  Mixing that crap with alcohol can knock a
person right down (this I have seen in real life) and respiratory arrest
sometimes follows.

@_subject: Is it still good practice to reinstall everything after you are 
Well if somebody who reads the CPunk list is "fixing" a failed Microsoft
operating system, that implies that the computer in question belongs to
somebody else who demands Microsoft.  In that case, industry best
practice is to follow the most expensive path possible:  "It is morally
wrong to allow a sucker to keep his money."  The more of a client or
employer's money you spend, the more important your job appears to be
and the more /you/ can charge.
So you will want to go shopping, and buy any "upgrades" that are
available.  Assure that the anti-virus and related tools installed are
the very most expensive.  If possible replace hardware, not just
software.  Explore the potential for adding firewall appliances etc. to
the network the compromised system plugs into - every security incident
is a window of sales opportunity and, thanks to the popular press and
the efforts of Microsoft and other snake oil vendors, the sky is not
necessarily the limit.  Start building a case to change out /everything/
IT related at the shop in question for the most expensive and massively
over-built infrastructure possible - where and as this becomes possible,
it qualifies as a Total Win.
Also bear in mind that once Microsoft has been specified, "security" is
out the window and compliance with popular misconceptions and IT sales
literature constitute due diligence on the security front.  As a
practical security objective, you will want to see the largest number of
security incidents your client or employer will tolerate going forward,
as you play the part of a heroic warrior battling hordes of Evil Genius
Super Hackers on their behalf.  Do this well, with a straight face and
the assistance of talking points from your vendors, to meet the only
security objective that matters:  Your job and retirement security.
Remember that an occasional /real/ loss of important assets will assure
that your client or employer values your services very highly.  If
things get too quiet around the shop for too long, dropping a couple of
anonymous tips on security issues at your shop in "hacking" forums -
make them look like a disgruntled ex-employee looking for pay-back - can
do wonders to boost your importance in the eyes of management.

... which tells us why supposedly "smart" people start howling and
pounding their chests like gorillas when presented with mere facts that
contradict their indoctrinated beliefs.  This applies especially on the
political front, where propagandists have /always/ exploited the
mechanisms of family and tribal bonding to condition people to defend
their rulers' interests, even "to the death" where and as necessary.
But what strategic cognitive manipulation has done, strategic cognitive
manipulation can also undo:  Displacing a rigidly held irrational belief
takes time and effort, but once the conversion process has gained enough
momentum it can become a self driving one-way process - especially if
the old belief system depends on "facts and logic" that stand out as
obvious lies and fallacies when seen in a new light.
We have our little ways, and I just ran across an excellent introduction
to some of the most powerful tricks of the counter-indoctrination trade:

Oddly enough, neither automated (Enigmail in Thunderbird) nor manual

unique in my experience.
As for proving who you are, other than live and in person the options do
seem rather limited.  One paradigm that I like:  Never mind key signing
protocols:  Just make a key, start using it to sign posts here, there
and anywhere, and build a history for that key that will, eventually,
persuade people that it really is yours.
"How do I know you are who you say you are?"
"Check my posting history in CPunks.  Goes back a ways, and I have been
signing my posts with the same key that's on the servers.  So far the
real me has not stepped up to disown it."
Not bullet proof, but would you settle for slug resistant?
BTW, why not use the keyserver network?  Just curious; I figure one way
of publicly presented a "public key" is much the same as any other...

Ideally, end users would be told on arrival that the site is going to
load arbitrary software onto their systems and eat up their CPU
capacity.  I don't see how 3rd party JS bitcoin mining could have any
impact on tracking (surveillance) other than adding a dimension to
existing browser fingerprinting methods.  Or why a corporate provider
would decide to forgo their advertising revenue just because an
additional cash cow has been implemented.
The only people who have any privacy on the networks now are those who
use filter plugins to block advertising content and restrict javascript
execution.  I would expect those same users to "just say no" to mining
for bitcoins, and/or doing any other distributed processing function the
nominal bitcoin miners may choose to perform.
Personal information that end users are not aware they are giving up
(regardless of how often we tell them) is already cryptocurrency, in
that "crypto" means hidden:  The small amount of information contributed
per session qualifies as a "micro" payment.  The markets where that
information is bought and sold qualify for the "crypto" designation, as
the end users are not aware that such markets exist or how that commerce
may impact their lives.
People who have massively powerful systems may not notice a performance
hit; people who don't will.  Same for bandwidth:  The mining process
will need to phone home constantly, reporting its state so the next user
can pick up where the last user left off.
On the equity side, State sponsored surveillance agencies like Google
and The Facebook can make money because their massive user base will
find coins for them; but small time operators will be locked out of that
income - it takes a /lot/ of cycles to find one bitcoin or equivalent.
More likely, the small time operators would be offered micropayments by
mining brokers, in exchange for incorporating links to the brokers' JS
miners into their HTML:  More or less the same as today's advertising
networks, except no bonus payments for click-throughs and end user
purchases.  If offered bonus payments in the ultra-rare event that one
of their site visitors finds a coin, those small time operators would
participate in an opaque lottery where the only way to know who won is
to trust the casino.
Verily.  A new front where Big Data will further degrade the overall
performance of the Internet by shoveling even more garbage onto end
users' systems.
Before anyone asks, yes I would like to see large parts of today's
commercial website infrastructure "fall down go boom" for want of
rapidly growing profit margins.  What can I say?  The net social and
political impact of "services" like Google and The Facebook has been
destructive so far.  Only a tiny minority of end users know they are
being systematically manipulated by personally targeted propaganda, or
that there are ways to opt out of that manipulation.

I view the United States of the 1960s as the second half of an
unprecedented 20 year economic boom produced by unprecedented advances
in technology, setting the scene for a cultural war between advocates of
compassionate & egalitarian values fueled by Middle Class prosperity and

authoritarian values.  The latter group won, hands down, because the

I saw it at a theater; a NamVet friend got a group together to go.  He
said something very much like that really happened, and I'm not inclined
to doubt it.
Back around 1979 or 80, one of my best friends and her son went stark
raving paranoid psychotic overnight.  Literally, they woke up insane,
closed the shop, boarded up their windows and prepared for the worst -
locked into a state of panic the whole time.
At that time, Carolyn was running a head shop near the University of
Central Florida, and a series of laws had recently been passed over the
course of a few months in an effort to shut down head shops in Florida,
with an apparent emphasis on hers:  The first to be raided on every day
the next law kicked in.  The other well known head shop in town was
never raided.  It did not open on the mornings of the raids, but some of
Carolyn's stock did appear on its shelves in the weeks following.
Also at that time, Lockheed Martin was building a missile plant less
than a mile down the road from Carolyn's head shop.  On the cross-corner
of the same intersection, a subdivision destined to house many of the
missile plant's employees broke ground.
Caroline never called her establishment an Infoshop, but it was exactly
that, loaded to the gunnels with anarchist literature and propaganda.
On slow days the stone gorgeous fucking brilliant hippie chick who ran
it was always happy to talk politics.  So, given Carolyn's location,
that store had to go.
Carolyn eventually recovered.  Her son did not.  In all fairness he was
starting to go nuts on his own - family history on his father's side -
but whatever nerve agent was used did him no favors either.
Every now and then when an "inconvenient" person kills themselves or
gets themselves shot, information on their behavior in the days leading
up to the event really does make me wonder.  Carolyn believed that she
was supposed to commit suicide, because someone had made it a point just
a couple of days earlier to assure that there would be a loaded gun in
the house.

I was told at the time that the medication in question contained a
"stimulant" and that it might make me feel "funny," but not to worry
about it, it would wear off in a few hours and I would eventually get
used to it.
I did not so much get used to it, as start really looking forward to it.
 When the second batch arrived, click, nothing.  No effect.
Along about that time I started to question literally everything,
including the nature of reality itself.  I can't say the experience
affected my core values - for instance I was already dead set against
war, regardless of excuses offered, and got in trouble from time to time
for not bothering to observe "color lines" on the playground etc.  But I
suspect the LSD did have a radicalizing effect, in the literal sense of
that word:  It directed my attention to the fundamentals that define a
person's life and the structure of events in the larger world.

Surveys of the literature have found no descriptions of "bad trips"
resulting from administration of LSD in a clinical setting, which
included subjects with diagnosed mental illnesses, and studies using
very large doses.  The classic "bad trip" first appeared in the wild
right on time to support the Federally sponsored full-saturation
domestic propaganda campaign against LSD.
Did the CIA murder Art Linkletter's daughter?  Maybe not her in
particular, on purpose.  But whoever made the alleged "LSD" she took
before diving out of a high window did. and her suicide was a huge
stroke of luck for the folks tasked to sell the public on a completely
false version of what LSD is and does.
When hearings were held to determine what schedule to put MDMA on,
clinical researchers who testified described it was uniquely useful;
they found it got stubbornly uncommunicative patients talking, and
enabled therapists to build useful rapport with them very quickly.
Their verdict was unanimous:  This is Good Shit, we wants it yes we
does.  Then the DEA guise gave their testimony, mostly a recitation of
War On Drugs propaganda talking points originally created for LSD, and
so MDMA was put on Schedule I.
MDMA has been described as an "empathogen," knocking down social anxiety
and replacing it, temporarily, with trust, confidence, and a (transient)
sense of strong social bonding with "just whoever happens to be there."
I speculate that the Feds chose to suppress MDMA both because of
unwanted macro scale social impacts, and because its obvious
intelligence tradecraft applications (elicitation of information, agent
development & recruitment) do not belong in "private" hands.
Today's "ecstasy" a.k.a. X contains no MDMA but typically does contain
amphetamine, heroin, and one or more "designer" drugs to tweak the
experience this way or that.  Mixing that crap with alcohol can knock a
person right down (this I have seen in real life) and respiratory arrest
sometimes follows.

@_subject: Is it still good practice to reinstall everything after you are 
Well if somebody who reads the CPunk list is "fixing" a failed Microsoft
operating system, that implies that the computer in question belongs to
somebody else who demands Microsoft.  In that case, industry best
practice is to follow the most expensive path possible:  "It is morally
wrong to allow a sucker to keep his money."  The more of a client or
employer's money you spend, the more important your job appears to be
and the more /you/ can charge.
So you will want to go shopping, and buy any "upgrades" that are
available.  Assure that the anti-virus and related tools installed are
the very most expensive.  If possible replace hardware, not just
software.  Explore the potential for adding firewall appliances etc. to
the network the compromised system plugs into - every security incident
is a window of sales opportunity and, thanks to the popular press and
the efforts of Microsoft and other snake oil vendors, the sky is not
necessarily the limit.  Start building a case to change out /everything/
IT related at the shop in question for the most expensive and massively
over-built infrastructure possible - where and as this becomes possible,
it qualifies as a Total Win.
Also bear in mind that once Microsoft has been specified, "security" is
out the window and compliance with popular misconceptions and IT sales
literature constitute due diligence on the security front.  As a
practical security objective, you will want to see the largest number of
security incidents your client or employer will tolerate going forward,
as you play the part of a heroic warrior battling hordes of Evil Genius
Super Hackers on their behalf.  Do this well, with a straight face and
the assistance of talking points from your vendors, to meet the only
security objective that matters:  Your job and retirement security.
Remember that an occasional /real/ loss of important assets will assure
that your client or employer values your services very highly.  If
things get too quiet around the shop for too long, dropping a couple of
anonymous tips on security issues at your shop in "hacking" forums -
make them look like a disgruntled ex-employee looking for pay-back - can
do wonders to boost your importance in the eyes of management.

... which tells us why supposedly "smart" people start howling and
pounding their chests like gorillas when presented with mere facts that
contradict their indoctrinated beliefs.  This applies especially on the
political front, where propagandists have /always/ exploited the
mechanisms of family and tribal bonding to condition people to defend
their rulers' interests, even "to the death" where and as necessary.
But what strategic cognitive manipulation has done, strategic cognitive
manipulation can also undo:  Displacing a rigidly held irrational belief
takes time and effort, but once the conversion process has gained enough
momentum it can become a self driving one-way process - especially if
the old belief system depends on "facts and logic" that stand out as
obvious lies and fallacies when seen in a new light.
We have our little ways, and I just ran across an excellent introduction
to some of the most powerful tricks of the counter-indoctrination trade:
This brief article presents techniques in the context of working on
oneself; but once applied, turning around and applying them to others
presents no challenges - only a bit of work in changing /external/
habits to conform to new internal ones.

Oddly enough, neither automated (Enigmail in Thunderbird) nor manual
(saved as text file, attempt to import with the --import command in GPG
1.4.16) works.  Both indicate "no valid OpenPGP data found".  This is
unique in my experience.
As for proving who you are, other than live and in person the options do
seem rather limited.  One paradigm that I like:  Never mind key signing
protocols:  Just make a key, start using it to sign posts here, there
and anywhere, and build a history for that key that will, eventually,
persuade people that it really is yours.
"How do I know you are who you say you are?"
"Check my posting history in CPunks.  Goes back a ways, and I have been
signing my posts with the same key that's on the servers.  So far the
real me has not stepped up to disown it."
Not bullet proof, but would you settle for slug resistant?
BTW, why not use the keyserver network?  Just curious; I figure one way
of publicly presented a "public key" is much the same as any other...
except that one way is very convenient and functionally reliable.

Once Upon A Time, I got so damned tired of Yahoo! "mail" that I
registered a domain name and got a web hosting account /just/ for real
e-mail service.  It was WAY worth it.  Shameless plug:  For hosting I
like Pair Networks a lot.
More fun:  Thunderbird speaks POP, IMAP and lately, even integrates with
GMail and Yahoo! if so required.  The Enigmail plugin makes crypto
functions e-z, even has a wizard for making brand new keys, as a
mail-oriented front end for GPG.
Reasonable security and reliability != difficulty and complexity for the
end user; as far as I can tell the belief that things are the opposite
of that is a product of 30 years of snake oil vendors disparaging
simple, effective professional tools.

@_subject: Pirate Bay, Showtime caught forcing visitors to mine 
Ideally, end users would be told on arrival that the site is going to
load arbitrary software onto their systems and eat up their CPU
capacity.  I don't see how 3rd party JS bitcoin mining could have any
impact on tracking (surveillance) other than adding a dimension to
existing browser fingerprinting methods.  Or why a corporate provider
would decide to forgo their advertising revenue just because an
additional cash cow has been implemented.
The only people who have any privacy on the networks now are those who
use filter plugins to block advertising content and restrict javascript
execution.  I would expect those same users to "just say no" to mining
for bitcoins, and/or doing any other distributed processing function the
nominal bitcoin miners may choose to perform.
Personal information that end users are not aware they are giving up
(regardless of how often we tell them) is already cryptocurrency, in
that "crypto" means hidden:  The small amount of information contributed
per session qualifies as a "micro" payment.  The markets where that
information is bought and sold qualify for the "crypto" designation, as
the end users are not aware that such markets exist or how that commerce
may impact their lives.
People who have massively powerful systems may not notice a performance
hit; people who don't will.  Same for bandwidth:  The mining process
will need to phone home constantly, reporting its state so the next user
can pick up where the last user left off.
On the equity side, State sponsored surveillance agencies like Google
and The Facebook can make money because their massive user base will
find coins for them; but small time operators will be locked out of that
income - it takes a /lot/ of cycles to find one bitcoin or equivalent.
More likely, the small time operators would be offered micropayments by
mining brokers, in exchange for incorporating links to the brokers' JS
miners into their HTML:  More or less the same as today's advertising
networks, except no bonus payments for click-throughs and end user
purchases.  If offered bonus payments in the ultra-rare event that one
of their site visitors finds a coin, those small time operators would
participate in an opaque lottery where the only way to know who won is
to trust the casino.
Verily.  A new front where Big Data will further degrade the overall
performance of the Internet by shoveling even more garbage onto end
users' systems.
Before anyone asks, yes I would like to see large parts of today's
commercial website infrastructure "fall down go boom" for want of
rapidly growing profit margins.  What can I say?  The net social and
political impact of "services" like Google and The Facebook has been
destructive so far.  Only a tiny minority of end users know they are
being systematically manipulated by personally targeted propaganda, or
that there are ways to opt out of that manipulation.

But like many brilliant ideas, one can find structural flaws if one
looks closely enough.  Here's my set:
1)  AP treats anonymity on the networks as a 'primitive', that is, a
Platonic ideal:  One either has anonymity or not, and if one does,
nobody can remove it regardless of resources brought to bear.
I see anonymity on the networks as nearly always relative and nearly
never absolute.  To achieve absolute anonymity, an individual must
commit "the perfect crime" by connecting to the networks once, briefly,
by physically breaking in at an access point not personally associated
with him or herself.
If not seen coming or going (a tricky prospect in 'civilized' countries
these days), and all digital fingerprints left behind present a generic,
non-traceable profile, success:  Unbreakable anonymity.  But any lesser
feat of operational cyber-warfare leaves some smaller or larger
probability that the message in question will be attributed to the right
I say "message" rather than "messages" because each instance of 100%
anonymous network access presents a fresh challenge.  Re-using the same
access point and/or techniques could potentially create an identifiable
profile.  "Really anonymous" network access presents as a job for well
trained intelligence officers and/or assets, not John and Jane Q. Public
looking to fund the removal of a politician they don't like.
Designers and operators of anonymizing overlay networks generally agree,
their tools do not by themselves provide "life safety" grade protection
against an adversary with global network surveillance capability.
Within the borders of a given State with a highly funded intelligence
establishment, such global adversaries already exist.  If AP rears its
very interesting head, the first response from the community targeted
for termination would include command directives and blank checks to
turn the AP process inside out.  Thus would exploitable gaps in network
surveillance close up fast.
AP depends on the ready availability of anonymity to thousands or
millions bettors, and dozens or hundreds of professional assassins.
Participation in any 'lottery of the doomed' (RIP Spain Rodriguez - and
Trashman, agent of the 6th International) would immediately become a
Federal felony with stiff minimum mandatory sentences.  The
unavailability of absolute anonymity for assassins, or even half-assed
anonymity for John and Jane Q. Public, would at best seriously degrade
the whole program.
2)  Large numbers make fools of us all.  AP appears to presume that
abusive politicians. and the cartels of billionaires who elect and
direct them, can not out-spend 'honest' participants in AP by orders of
magnitude at need.  Well... they can.  And if required, they will.
Bounties on actual and perceived "enemies of the State and ruling class"
participating in the AP process would greatly exceed bounties on State
and corporate offenders within weeks of the first pay-out by an honest
AP game.  Massive bounties for "information leading to the arrest and
conviction" of AP operators and anyone collecting bets made in that
lottery would greatly exceed those available to "honest" assassins who
play by the rules of AP.  (Anyone here naive enough to believe that AP
lotteries can not and will not be outlawed within days of a perceived
reason to do so?)  Combined with top priority directives to /all/
intelligence and law enforcement agencies to shut that shit down PRONTO,
hostile AP-like games would create a steep uphill climb for honest AP
participants and winners.
For a quick correction to "common sense" assumptions about income
disparity in the USA - which is less than asset disparity by a couple of
orders of magnitude - see http//lcurve.org
3)  As a general conclusion, I think that for AP to work as intended and
usher in an age of NAP based Anarchist society - an objective no truly
sane individual could oppose IMO - it would be necessary for only
"honest" lotteries that deny targeting of "Libertarian" figures to
present games.  But two can play at any game, as long as the second
players in question happen to be filthy rich.
In real life, "Operate an AP lottery, die within weeks of announcing it
to the public and getting enough capital under management to motivate an
assassin."  Or in a best case scenario, pull 20 years without parole in
a Federal prison.  That same sentence would also be available to any
random participant who happens to get "outed" by any of several
technical means readily available to the NSA and comparable signals
intelligence services.
I do believe that the above factors explain why Assassination Politics
has not been implemented in the 20 or so years the instructions have
been floating around.  As far as I know, nobody has even tried.
Alas, for those who want to Change The World from the bottom up, it
looks to me like conventional populist political warfare - the darkest
of the Dark Arts - in the sense that nearly nobody outside agencies
tasked to prevent it knows the first damn thing about how it works -
remains the only game in town.

I don't think today's criminal uses of the TOR network provide an
adequate model of circumstances in a world where someone has implemented
the AP protocol against ruling class interests.  Then, funding and
motivation for breaking network anonymity would be effectively
unlimited.  We should also expect to see unprecedented international
cooperation in network surveillance, since the networks cross most
borders and so do the interests of most potential AP target persons and
their enterprises.
In the event that AP lotteries prove difficult to roll up quickly
through existing surveillance and law enforcement techniques, we should
also expect to see TOR, I2P, etc. outlawed, and signals intelligence
assets dedicated to interrupting traffic and shutting down relays.
Fun's fun and intelligence services have their own uses for these
networks, but none of those uses would compare in importance to keeping
the people our intelligence services ultimately work for alive.
I don't think "hopless" conditions would be necessary to deter most
potential contributors from participating in AP lotteries as funders.
Propagandists routinely use handfuls of worst case examples to promote
fantasy threat models, creating a perception of imminent personal danger
across very wide audiences.
Ideologically motivated assassins who don't expect to survive look for
funding before, not after doing the deed; and they normally select their
own targets.  So I would consider a reasonable expectation of surviving
to collect the bounty as an essential motive for assassins to
participate in AP.  Except maybe when they participate just to raise
funds for their own privately motivated "do and die" projects.  :D
At present, the "law and order" necessary to maintain a stable
environment for commerce benefiting our rulers levels the playing field
a little.  If implemented, AP would present a radical threat to the
stability of all their games.  Not only the public at large, but
competing cartels among AP's nominal targets would employ the AP
protocol to hire inconvenient people including each other killed.  At
present our rulers do not seem to see minor threats to their operations
from "anonymous leakers" etc. as serious enough to merit radical action
against TOR, I2P, etc.  Some may have already started using these
networks to expose their competitors' dirty laundry.  But in the event
AP gets implemented... see above.

As a critique of Right Wing militia fantasies, the above stands up well.
But as a statement about armed insurrection in general, it presents a
straw man argument:  Nobody will stage an armed insurrection against a
21st century government by using 18th century colonial strategy and
tactics; anyone who tries it will certainly lose, early and badly.
The strategic objectives of modern insurrections rarely include
replacing the whole government, and winning tactical options rarely
include defeating the national armed forces in head to head conflict;
that requires mass defection and non-compliance by the opposing force.
Instead, an insurrection seeks "redress of grievances" i.e. radical
changes in State policy and procedures.  Bringing commerce to a halt via
boycotts, civil disobedience, sabotage, etc. reliably produces maximum
results at minimum risk.  "Economic terrorism" ranks at or near first
place in formal assessments of threats to State and Corporate power today.
The State exists to provide a stable environment for commerce and to
enforce the rights, so called, of absentee landlords.  It has no other
purpose.  When the State fails in these missions and can not restore
business as usual by force, the State's owner/operators come to the
bargaining table prepared to make concessions.  In the United States,
the Labor Movement and Civil Rights Movement achieved significant
objectives working within this model of domestic political warfare.
Competent insurrectionists do not kill people except in self defense;
murdering one's opponents only makes it difficult or impossible for the
survivors to come to the bargaining table mentioned above.  "Off The
Pig" was a heavily promoted slogan in the 60s and 70s when the FBI was
running "Communist" revolutionary cells in the United States - guess who
promoted it, and why?
Our rulers and their faithful servants make every reasonable effort to
provide the public with pre-failed models of rebellion, and to deny the
public access to information about practical populist politics.  "Rebel
As You Are Told" ranks second behind "Divide The Conquered" among the
most necessary, persistent and well funded themes in State and Corporate
propaganda today.  Anyone who wants to see input from public at large
have any impact of State policy and Corporate behavior faces a long
uphill climb.  Any chance of success must start with basic political
education.  An example of such:

Common and inexpensive means of fabricating titanium alloy parts,
aerospace guidance systems and servomechanisms, high energy propellants
and explosives, etc.  And integrating them into one system that does not
blow up when the "fire" button is pressed, killing the users.
If you want to play with backpack portable anti-aircraft weapons, you
have three options:  Buy them, steal them, or promise Uncle Sam you will
shoot down the planes of his choice while wearing someone else's uniform.
Let's imagine that you have managed to get hold of, for instance, a
couple of crates of real live stinger missiles, with manuals etc., all
airworthy and ready to go:  Start using them to off pigs.  What happens?
 A state of emergency, martial law, a coast to coast and international
manhunt using every surveillance database and collection method known to
man.  Forensics teams will find exactly where in the supply chain you
got your missiles, and investigators will work forward from there and
backward from the scene of the crime until they meet in the middle:  You
and your team.
Would the public rise up?  A lot of them would, to help find you:  John

murder, unless it's been explained in advance by trusted media outlets
on the basis of some overriding "necessity", sugar coated, and the
gruesome details hidden from them.  Your project would get the full

hundreds of millions of citizens.

Our respondent was talking about killing political offenders, not their
A.K.A. revenge.
Revenge is a losing strategy, alienating potential supporters and
assuring that the opposition will "fight to the last man" even in
hopeless situations.  So revenge is a core component of the Rebel As You
Are Told package provided to would-be rebels by their rulers.
Killing in self defense only, and offering a path to rehabilitation for
defectors from the Other Side, are winning strategies.

Groovy, but a 24 inch rocket casing does not even come close to a
practical weapon in portability, accuracy or knock-down power.  How much
of it was taken up by fuel, vs. payload and avionics?  Did it have a
steering mechanism with capabilities beyond "keep the rocket vertical"?
High strength, heat tolerant materials are unnecessary unless your
design calls for accelerating and steering a payload that can reliably
knock down an aircraft, and actually hitting targets with it.  Past a
cut-off point, efficiency and extra cleverness can not substitute for
brute force and total ignorance.  In the case at hand, existing
munitions indicate that all of the above are necessary for success.
Discrete COTS components fail spec in this case, because per the stated
design they they will be plugged into a "smart phone."  By definition
that phone is live opposition hardware radio, unless the antennas and/or
radio chip are removed.  That done, it's still running the opposition's
software of choice unless thoroughly cleaned.  By the time you're done
modding the hardware and software, it's cheaper and far easier to use a
Raspberri Pi or similar device.  That's what they're for.
Warheads are generally high explosive shaped charges.  Some deliver a
single penetrator slug, white-hot and ultrasonic; others deliver shot in
a narrow cone, horizontal band, or radially as in a bounding mine
application.  Anti-aircraft shot varies in shape and composition,
typically a mix of polyhedrons and bowties, uranium of course.
The cleverest warheads can deliver a selection of projectile patterns,
by altering the timing of multiple primers in the driving charge.  Your
plane killer won't need anything that fancy.  But it will need to haul a
load of heavy metal and top end high explosives to within spitting
distance of the target aircraft, figuratively speaking, and fire that
warhead right on time.
The only thing that calls to mind is the cheap knock-offs of WWII
stovepipe artillery rockets that were carried in by ISIS to stage a
"Syrian Government Chemical Weapons Attack" way back in the early days
of the war.  The op was fail.  Other than that, ISIS & Co. appears to
get the best our international gray market arms dealsers can offer,
courtesy of your local CIA and its sister agencies, plus buddies overseas.
It's a long, hard, complicated road from lighting a big skyrocket to
shooting down airplanes, especially under the watchful eyes of State
Security as per a civil uprising scenario.  Your cell could get a lot
more bang for the buck by preparing to attack infrastructure targets
affecting industrial facilities, with "kill nobody" among the top
strategic objectives.  There, extra efficiency and superior cleverness
do pay off compared to brute force and total ignorance.
Killing people to improve the world presents as the ultimate Loser
Script.  To rebel as one is told, is not to rebel at all.

boycotts, civil disobedience, sabotage, etc. reliably produces maximum
results at minimum risk.  "Economic terrorism" ranks at or near first
place in formal assessments of threats to State and Corporate power today.
The State exists to provide a stable environment for commerce and to
enforce the rights, so called, of absentee landlords.  It has no other
purpose.  When the State fails in these missions and can not restore
business as usual by force, the State's owner/operators come to the
bargaining table prepared to make concessions.  In the United States,
the Labor Movement and Civil Rights Movement achieved significant
objectives working within this model of domestic political warfare.
Competent insurrectionists do not kill people except in self defense;
murdering one's opponents only makes it difficult or impossible for the
survivors to come to the bargaining table mentioned above.  "Off The
Pig" was a heavily promoted slogan in the 60s and 70s when the FBI was
running "Communist" revolutionary cells in the United States - guess who
promoted it, and why?
Our rulers and their faithful servants make every reasonable effort to
provide the public with pre-failed models of rebellion, and to deny the
public access to information about practical populist politics.  "Rebel
As You Are Told" ranks second behind "Divide The Conquered" among the
most necessary, persistent and well funded themes in State and Corporate
propaganda today.  Anyone who wants to see input from public at large
have any impact of State policy and Corporate behavior faces a long
uphill climb.  Any chance of success must start with basic political
education.  An example of such:

Common and inexpensive means of fabricating titanium alloy parts,
aerospace guidance systems and servomechanisms, high energy propellants
and explosives, etc.  And integrating them into one system that does not
blow up when the "fire" button is pressed, killing the users.
If you want to play with backpack portable anti-aircraft weapons, you
have three options:  Buy them, steal them, or promise Uncle Sam you will
shoot down the planes of his choice while wearing someone else's uniform.
Let's imagine that you have managed to get hold of, for instance, a
couple of crates of real live stinger missiles, with manuals etc., all
airworthy and ready to go:  Start using them to off pigs.  What happens?
 A state of emergency, martial law, a coast to coast and international
manhunt using every surveillance database and collection method known to
man.  Forensics teams will find exactly where in the supply chain you
got your missiles, and investigators will work forward from there and
backward from the scene of the crime until they meet in the middle:  You
and your team.
Would the public rise up?  A lot of them would, to help find you:  John
and Jane Q. Public generally don't approve of politically motivated
murder, unless it's been explained in advance by trusted media outlets
on the basis of some overriding "necessity", sugar coated, and the
gruesome details hidden from them.  Your project would get the full
demonization treatment and "propaganda works."
Solve all of the above problems and proceed:  You will discover that
killing scapegoats does not repair systemic disorders hard wired into
the fabric of daily life and business as usual in a country with
hundreds of millions of citizens.

Our respondent was talking about killing political offenders, not their
A.K.A. revenge.
Revenge is a losing strategy, alienating potential supporters and
assuring that the opposition will "fight to the last man" even in
hopeless situations.  So revenge is a core component of the Rebel As You
Are Told package provided to would-be rebels by their rulers.
Killing in self defense only, and offering a path to rehabilitation for
defectors from the Other Side, are winning strategies.

Groovy, but a 24 inch rocket casing does not even come close to a
practical weapon in portability, accuracy or knock-down power.  How much
of it was taken up by fuel, vs. payload and avionics?  Did it have a
steering mechanism with capabilities beyond "keep the rocket vertical"?
High strength, heat tolerant materials are unnecessary unless your
design calls for accelerating and steering a payload that can reliably
knock down an aircraft, and actually hitting targets with it.  Past a
cut-off point, efficiency and extra cleverness can not substitute for
brute force and total ignorance.  In the case at hand, existing
munitions indicate that all of the above are necessary for success.
Discrete COTS components fail spec in this case, because per the stated
design they they will be plugged into a "smart phone."  By definition
that phone is live opposition hardware radio, unless the antennas and/or
radio chip are removed.  That done, it's still running the opposition's
software of choice unless thoroughly cleaned.  By the time you're done
modding the hardware and software, it's cheaper and far easier to use a
Raspberri Pi or similar device.  That's what they're for.
Warheads are generally high explosive shaped charges.  Some deliver a
single penetrator slug, white-hot and ultrasonic; others deliver shot in
a narrow cone, horizontal band, or radially as in a bounding mine
application.  Anti-aircraft shot varies in shape and composition,
typically a mix of polyhedrons and bowties, uranium of course.
The cleverest warheads can deliver a selection of projectile patterns,
by altering the timing of multiple primers in the driving charge.  Your
plane killer won't need anything that fancy.  But it will need to haul a
load of heavy metal and top end high explosives to within spitting
distance of the target aircraft, figuratively speaking, and fire that
warhead right on time.
The only thing that calls to mind is the cheap knock-offs of WWII
stovepipe artillery rockets that were carried in by ISIS to stage a
"Syrian Government Chemical Weapons Attack" way back in the early days
of the war.  The op was fail.  Other than that, ISIS & Co. appears to
get the best our international gray market arms dealsers can offer,
courtesy of your local CIA and its sister agencies, plus buddies overseas.
It's a long, hard, complicated road from lighting a big skyrocket to
shooting down airplanes, especially under the watchful eyes of State
Security as per a civil uprising scenario.  Your cell could get a lot
more bang for the buck by preparing to attack infrastructure targets
affecting industrial facilities, with "kill nobody" among the top
strategic objectives.  There, extra efficiency and superior cleverness
do pay off compared to brute force and total ignorance.
Killing people to improve the world presents as the ultimate Loser
Script.  To rebel as one is told, is not to rebel at all.

UL Certified life safety equipment to production design and management,

Greenwald distributed the PRISM documents to several press outlets, at

People have superstitious beliefs about most of the things they know

know how it works, therefore it must be either Good or Evil.  In this
frame of reference, Evil would be the "most correct" answer, because
Javascript does get used for Evil purposes like diverting users' web
browsers to hostile sites, inflicting unwanted porn ads on them, and
otherwise controlling the user's browser against the user's will.
Allowing a web browser to execute Javascript from random sources also
crates an attack surface for actual malware, with a variety of bad
outcomes for the end user.
In more rational terms, Javascript is neither Good nor Evil, it's just
software that web browsers download from websites and run automatically.
 Most often Javascript qualifies as "junk software", eating system
resources and annoying website visitors for no reason other than
fashion.  Javascript that enables browsers to present interactive maps,
online games etc. would qualify as Good.  The most widely distributed
Javascript code in the world is the Google Analytics tracker; this code
qualifies as Evil, since most users do NOT want their browsing habits to
be under total surveillance, and doubly so because most users have no
idea it exists.
Calling a website that teaches people how to AVOID most user
surveillance and profiling on the networks Evil because it uses

Winner had previously been arrested."
"...I should say that the arrest of Reality Winner was announced within
minutes of the article being posted by The Intercept."
That sounds like a whitewash to me.  The Intercept published a scanned
document from Reality Winner on their website, with an easily recovered
watermark identifying the printer used by serial number, along with the
date and time the document was printed.  I recovered the watermark from

The Intercept may just as well have called the FBI with a "hot tip" as
publish that document without bothering to sanitize it.  Although the
above quotes lay the groundwork for denial of responsibility for
identifying the leaker, the Intercept AT MINIMUM verified her identity
to investigators, assuring her conviction in Court.
At minimum, The Intercept's handling of the documents from Reality
Winner indicate Glenn Greenwald, Pierre Omidyar & Co.'s ABSOLUTE

@_subject: Are the interwebz rather big for google to index? 
Back around 2000 or so, when Google was under initial development, I
read about other search providers complaining because the NSA loaned
engineers to Google to help them develop their server farm architecture.
Since then I have often wished I had access to the Google search
utilities NSA analysts have.
Other search providers' complaints had nothing to do with the NSA being
"evil" but rather, with Uncle Sam interfering in commerce by playing
favorites:  'Why don't we get this kind of free handout?'  I don't
recall Google disputing the NSA's role in building the foundation of
their physical plant and/or algorithms.
In light of this paper from brookings.edu, not only do I suspect that
Google can index the whole of the publicly accessible Internet, but
cache all of the Internet's content as well:
Professor Villasenor indicated that the storage density now exists to
record and retain /all/ surveillance data.  The redundancy of network
traffic (same web page to 10,000 users) cuts the size of the archive
down to a tiny fraction of the network's gross traffic volume.
The NSA's Bluffdale facility may greatly reduce Google's role in
indexing and content storage for Uncle Sam, but once established,
relationships like that only expire as/when the organizations themselves
and their relevant staff members expire.
Google strongly biases search results to reinforce individual "user
preferences" and consumer profiles, both to provide a more addictive
"user experience" and to herd users toward Google's real customers,
their advertising clients.  Seek and ye shall find plenty of information
on that subject; a whole industry (SEO) struggles to sell services based
on their analysis of Google bias, not to mention in-house efforts by
other "public relations" providers to crack Google's algorithms.  Search
is a battlefield.
The best example I remember of Google censorship involved a YouTube
video based on an article about The Facebook's funding sources -
describing how the said company was capitalized to go national by DARPA
financiers, and The Facebook's shocking abusive TOS.  After about 15
minutes of digging I gave up and concluded that the video had been taken
down and Google's memory of it expunged.
Later I did find a saved copy of the video in an old archive of mine.
Searching at Google using the video's exact title and file name did turn
it up on the first try.  Previously, the same words in a different order
and numerous very similar strings returned nothing related to the video
in question.  Searches for "approximate" versions of the title still
returned nothing useful.
I consider that a fine example of how Google itself engages in "negative
SEO" to suppress distribution of selected content while avoiding charges
of "censorship" - in a very narrow technical sense, the suppressed
content does remain available to the public.
"Don't Be Evil - That's OUR Job"
BTW, here's the thing:  A "loose search" now turns up a different copy someone else uploaded,
probably after failing to find the original...

Hi All,
The Program on Liberation Technologies at Stanford University (LT) has
been going strong since circa 2006. Since then, LT has helped thousands
design, use, and research technologies that foster the public good.
Recently, the decision was made to spin off LT as an independent entity.
I'm one of the people tasked with doing so. Here are LT's major needs:
    Recruit people to develop a new website, logo, and graphics.
    Identify a legal jurisdiction with strong security and privacy laws
and regulations and a server provider with a stellar reputation at
protecting user security and privacy to host the site.
    Determine whether to maintain LT's mailing lists on Mailman or to
transition them to a content management system (e.g., Discourse.org).
    Assess the best legal structure for LT (e.g., digital cooperative).
Any ideas? Thanks for your help and advice.

"So in June 2017, The Intercept published a story which contained a
leaked NSA document that was classified and in the document it basically
alleged that Russian actors had tried to hack election vendors in a
variety of states.  A short time later it was announced that Reality
Winner had previously been arrested."
"...I should say that the arrest of Reality Winner was announced within
minutes of the article being posted by The Intercept."
That sounds like a whitewash to me.  The Intercept published a scanned
document from Reality Winner on their website, with an easily recovered
watermark identifying the printer used by serial number, along with the
date and time the document was printed.  I recovered the watermark from
that image myself using the GIMP, just to verify it was there.
See:  The word "watermark" does not appear in any of the three Intercept
articles about Reality Winner from The Intercept, linked above.
The Intercept may just as well have called the FBI with a "hot tip" as
publish that document without bothering to sanitize it.  Although the
above quotes lay the groundwork for denial of responsibility for
identifying the leaker, the Intercept AT MINIMUM verified her identity
to investigators, assuring her conviction in Court.
At minimum, The Intercept's handling of the documents from Reality
Winner indicate Glenn Greenwald, Pierre Omidyar & Co.'s ABSOLUTE
incompetence and make it impossible for her to deny being the
"anonymous" leaker in question.
Had she sent the dox to Wikileaks or Cryptome, Reality Winner would

The problem with "proof that TOR is not compromised" comes in a much
broader context:  Proving negative propositions.  Cases like the one at
hand, presenting numerous variables and many of them hidden, do not
permit negative proofs.
However, I can show how a State or Corporate actor with moderate
resources can compromise the TOR network.  I call this a hydra attack,
because one body many heads:
First set up a cloud server to run thousands or tens of thousands of
modified TOR routers under hypervisor control.  That's the hydra's body.
Then connect these TOR instances to remote machines acting as
transparent proxies via botnets, dedicated applicances etc., distributed
worldwide, with a statistically normal amount of relay and exit nodes.
These are the hydra's heads.
Viola.  Roll out the deployment gradually to avoid spooking people (as
happened in 2013 when a botnet deployment accounted for 3/4 of the
client nodes) and in due time you will own and control a majority of
nodes in the TOR network with no one the wiser.
From here to a better than 90% 'unmasking' rate per TOR connection is
left as an exercise.  Note that due to customized routers on the cloud
server, any message that touches the hydra will not be allowed to leave
it until outbound to its final destination:  The hydra's owner
determines whether or not packets in transit cross the open network or
just get passed around inside the cloud server.
This solution generalizes to /all/ distributed mix routing network
protocols, as far as I can tell.

Back around 1999 or 2000 I documented what I believed to be an ongoing,
successful attack agaisnt the Mixmaster remailer network.
First, I attempted to geolocate all the 'reliable' routers then active.
I found a startling number of them in the State of Texas, suggesting one
sponsor for all - therefore, capable of following the "bouncing ball" of
high latency traffic in many chains.
I found others in IP ranges assigned to various countries, including
ones with "mutually hostile" political and economic relations.  So I
created chains that crossed mutually hostile borders and started sending
test messages.  I sent several batches over a period of about a week.
NONE ever came back to me, indicating high likelihood of deliberate
interruption of that traffic - the global adversary at work.
So there's nothing new about the "ha ha fuck you" nature of allegedly
anonymized comms on the networks.  The only real security afforded would
be in the "my adversary does not want to openly disclose this capability
if he can avoid it" category, which is thin cover indeed...
IMO physical opsec is the only guarantor of anonymity on the networks:
Hit and run comms with a scrambled MAC address via open routers, with
due attention to avoiding surveillance on the way in and out, seems to
be the only option where /real/ hazards from State sponsored terrorist
reprisals are on the table.

Here's a silly notion:
First you need a network of servers that can store and forward large
amounts of data in the form of text, and distribute it across enough
nodes to make the stored data deletion-resistant and reasonably
accessible to a large number of users.  NNTP will do nicely.
Then you need privately owned devices capable of downloading gigabytes
of data daily, and applying a decryption test to millions of messages as
they flow by.  Today's low end PCs will do nicely.
Those gigabytes of text?  Symmetrically encrypted messages from the
whole Alice, Bob, etc. alphabet soup of users, employing keys obtained
by whatever means from their intended message recipients.
Everyone participating in this network would download the whole stream,
testing the encrypted subject line of each discrete message with their
personal keys, looking for the flag that says "this one's for you."
Those messages would be decrypted instead of discarded, and presented in
a local inbox.  The rest would just zoom on past.
Sending a message?  Encrypt it and its subject line with your
recipients' keys, and send it on its way.  If your recipient downloads
the stream before your message expires, success.
3rd party observers?  Out in the cold, unless they penetrate individual
users' machines or otherwise compromise endpoints, one user at a time.
This protocol presents as an application of the most time honored and
reliable principle of engineering practice:  Brute force and total
ignorance.  With a side of COTS:  We already have all the parts, this
could be done with shell scripts.
The only counter attacks I immediately see include flooding past the
breaking point with purely random bits, which may require mitigation via
short cycle message expiration or some kind of registration or proof of
work process for users; or interruption of traffic by a global (or
local) active adversary.

ages and I think its time may have come.
Here's a silly notion:
First you need a network of servers that can store and forward large
amounts of data in the form of text, and distribute it across enough
nodes to make the stored data deletion-resistant and reasonably
accessible to a large number of users.  NNTP will do nicely.
Then you need privately owned devices capable of downloading gigabytes
of data daily, and applying a decryption test to millions of messages as
they flow by.  Today's low end PCs will do nicely.
Those gigabytes of text?  Symmetrically encrypted messages from the
whole Alice, Bob, etc. alphabet soup of users, employing keys obtained
by whatever means from their intended message recipients.
Everyone participating in this network would download the whole stream,
testing the encrypted subject line of each discrete message with their
personal keys, looking for the flag that says "this one's for you."
Those messages would be decrypted instead of discarded, and presented in
a local inbox.  The rest would just zoom on past.
Sending a message?  Encrypt it and its subject line with your
recipients' keys, and send it on its way.  If your recipient downloads
the stream before your message expires, success.
3rd party observers?  Out in the cold, unless they penetrate individual
users' machines or otherwise compromise endpoints, one user at a time.
This protocol presents as an application of the most time honored and
reliable principle of engineering practice:  Brute force and total
ignorance.  With a side of COTS:  We already have all the parts, this
could be done with shell scripts.
The only counter attacks I immediately see include flooding past the
breaking point with purely random bits, which may require mitigation via
short cycle message expiration or some kind of registration or proof of
work process for users; or interruption of traffic by a global (or
local) active adversary.

The problem with "proof that TOR is not compromised" comes in a much
broader context:  Proving negative propositions.  Cases like the one at
hand, presenting numerous variables and many of them hidden, do not
permit negative proofs.
However, I can show how a State or Corporate actor with moderate
resources can compromise the TOR network.  I call this a hydra attack,
because one body many heads:
First set up a cloud server to run thousands or tens of thousands of
modified TOR routers under hypervisor control.  That's the hydra's body.
Then connect these TOR instances to remote machines acting as
transparent proxies via botnets, dedicated applicances etc., distributed
worldwide, with a statistically normal amount of relay and exit nodes.
These are the hydra's heads.
Viola.  Roll out the deployment gradually to avoid spooking people (as
happened in 2013 when a botnet deployment accounted for 3/4 of the
client nodes) and in due time you will own and control a majority of
nodes in the TOR network with no one the wiser.
From here to a better than 90% 'unmasking' rate per TOR connection is
left as an exercise.  Note that due to customized routers on the cloud
server, any message that touches the hydra will not be allowed to leave
it until outbound to its final destination:  The hydra's owner
determines whether or not packets in transit cross the open network or
just get passed around inside the cloud server.
This solution generalizes to /all/ distributed mix routing network
protocols, as far as I can tell.

Back around 1999 or 2000 I documented what I believed to be an ongoing,
successful attack agaisnt the Mixmaster remailer network.
First, I attempted to geolocate all the 'reliable' routers then active.
I found a startling number of them in the State of Texas, suggesting one
sponsor for all - therefore, capable of following the "bouncing ball" of
high latency traffic in many chains.
I found others in IP ranges assigned to various countries, including
ones with "mutually hostile" political and economic relations.  So I
created chains that crossed mutually hostile borders and started sending
test messages.  I sent several batches over a period of about a week.
NONE ever came back to me, indicating high likelihood of deliberate
interruption of that traffic - the global adversary at work.
So there's nothing new about the "ha ha fuck you" nature of allegedly
anonymized comms on the networks.  The only real security afforded would
be in the "my adversary does not want to openly disclose this capability
if he can avoid it" category, which is thin cover indeed...
IMO physical opsec is the only guarantor of anonymity on the networks:
Hit and run comms with a scrambled MAC address via open routers, with
due attention to avoiding surveillance on the way in and out, seems to
be the only option where /real/ hazards from State sponsored terrorist
reprisals are on the table.

Ignorant, easily led Trump supporters believe he opposes the Deep State.
 Intelligent, well paid Trump supporters understand that his whole job,
and by extension theirs, is to give the Deep State exactly what it wants
at all times.  To understand this one must understand the difference
between what propagandists working the alt-Right crowd mean when they
say "Deep State," and what academics who study political systems mean
when they say "Deep State."  The closer one looks, the smaller the
similarity becomes - until it disappears completely.
In contemporary propaganda, the term Deep State refers to an hereditary
Conspiracy of evil individuals, well known to true believers who take
every Conspiracy Theory with any paranoid and/or racist content as rock
solid fact.  Their version of the Deep State works tirelessly to destroy
everything white working class conservative Christians consider right,
good and holy.  For full details of this version of the Deep State,
enter 'illuminati new world order' in any search engine.
In political science, the term Deep State refers to the army of career
civil servants, appointed officials, and private contractors who conduct
the government's actual business.  Collectively, they have many shared
interests and agendas; and without their advice, consent and
cooperation, elected officials can not get anything done.  This gives
the government as a whole huge inertia, a tendency to "keep doing what
it has always done" regardless of popular demand for change, or
unwelcome policy directives from elected officials.
Below:  Four essays introducing and explaining various aspects of the
real Deep State.  Or in other words, the original Deep State concept our
alt-Right propagandists borrowed their new, improved name for the
Illuminati / New World Order Conspiracy from.
"There is the visible government situated around the Mall in Washington,
and then there is another, more shadowy, more indefinable government
that is not explained in Civics 101 or observable to tourists at the
White House or the Capitol. The former is traditional Washington
partisan politics: the tip of the iceberg that a public watching C-SPAN
sees daily and which is theoretically controllable via elections. The
subsurface part of the iceberg I shall call the Deep State, which
operates according to its own compass heading regardless of who is
formally in power."
"The Deep State is not just the military intelligence community, but
also consists of transnational corporations, big business and Big Oil,
Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and think tanks. Groups and institutions in
this structure form various coalitions that can compete, but tend to
seek agreement on certain fundamental policies that benefit their mutual
positions of power."
“Trump’s not Sir Galahad against the evil Deep State. Of course, they
completely ignore the fact that, one, he’s a product of it – that whole
New York high finance world is one adjunct of the Deep State. Second,
Trump showed it to us with his cabinet picks for the economy. And third,
he is advocating a 10 percent increase in military spending. How could
this guy be opposed to the Deep State?”
"The United States has, in short, moved beyond a mere imperial
presidency to a bifurcated system — a structure of double government —
in which even the President now exercises little substantive control
over the overall direction of U.S. national security policy. Whereas
Britain’s dual institutions evolved towards a concealed republic,
America’s have evolved in the opposite direction, toward greater
centralization, less accountability, and emergent autocracy."

"Brick and mortar" school teaches three lessons of great importance:
1)  Show up on time every day whether you want to or not.
2)  Do your assigned tasks as directed whether you want to or not.
3)  The people in charge always have all the final answers.
Any other lessons learned present as added value for the economic and
political actors who will exploit obedience trained public school
inmates for the rest of their lives.
The process of sorting future winners and losers includes giving higher
quality instruction to the more obedient kids, while treating the less
obedient as stupid and providing them with a "for losers" curriculum.
More recently, drugging noncompliant students has joined the mix of
strategies for shaping and limiting the social and political impact of
"disruptive" personalities in tomorrow's crop of adults.
"But what about socialization?"  What indeed - see above for the kind of
socialization public schools provide.  It took 40 years to build a
climate of fear sufficient to support literally outlawing normal,
organic socialization, i.e. letting your kids run around with the
neighbor kids.  As a result, public school and broadcast media get the
final say as formative social influences on the peer relationships of
tomorrow's adult consumers - except where parents remove public school
from the mix and work to replace it with "real world" social development

Ah, the Progressives!  I first got to know them back when they were
called the New Left:  Think "Hanoi" Jane Fonda & co.  Over the years my
on-contact categorical rejection of the New Left's message evolved into
a personal theory that they were, wittingly or otherwise, fielded by a
Federal domestic political warfare activity.  Their mission:  Displace
and discredit Pacifists and Liberals who were getting way too much
influence during the Vietnam War.  As always in mass media, nothing
attracts attention like violence, even if it's only violent and
deliberately offensive rhetoric; the plan, if plan it was, worked very
In this same time frame, COINTELPRO was A Thing and the FBI went so far
as to provide training, money, arms and explosives to Militant Leftists,
creating "shocking headlines" in an effort to equate anti-war and other
Liberal / ComSymp sentiments with violent extremism in the public mind.
 In light of the FBI arranging for people to actually bomb banks and
such, it would be absurd to imagine that they did not also field double
agents, witting or witless, to present a stereotyped "made to be hated"
pro-Commie, anti-American "Leftist" message to the Folks At Home.
A funny thing happened after the Vietnam War:  The New Left still had
its press contacts and professional networks, and kept right on going.
After a few years of dormancy, Hanoi Jane married a conventional
politician and got a faux Liberal makeover.  At about that time I
started running into people in real life who presented as political
activists and talked about "political correctness" as if they had some
moral right to dictate what Liberals and Radicals could and could not
think, say and do.  My initial reaction was "fuck y'all." Subsequent
experience has proved my instinctive anarchist response correct.
The Progressives worked industriously through the Reagan years, and
managed to take over key roles in the Democratic Party.  They elected
one of their own - The Clintons - to the Presidency.  Did the old New
Left do that on their own, or with assistance from our Security
Services?  I have no hard data on that, but need I mention the
relationship established when the CIA obtained full support from
Governor Clinton for the Iran/Contra cocaine trafficking business, and
the infamous Clinton Body Count from that era?  Since before that day to
the present, Progressive political actors have worked hand in glove with
radical fringe Right Wing extremist elements of our "Deep State."
The Clintons' zero-tolerance policy toward folks like the Patriot
Movement (who remembers Ruby Ridge?), and the mass murder they carried
out in Wayco, Texas do not impress me as evidence of an anti-Right
agenda.  I see a commitment to Corporate interests who dictate a zero
tolerance policy toward any kind of wildcat political organizing, not
under the firm control of well entrenched, uber-wealthy factions in the
U.S. political/economic ecology.

million to one, and that can't be a comfortable position for a de facto
criminal elite to find itself in.  Populism presents an existential
threat to the world as they know it - a world where less than
1/100,000th of the population literally makes all the decisions
affecting our species as a whole.  So it can't be allowed, is all.
Anyone who doubts the identity vs. "close relationship" of the
Progressive establishment with the Far Right needs only look into the
relationship between Henry Kissinger and Hillary Clinton:  They present
themselves in public as best buddies, and Hillary calls him her mentor.
 Her own track record for mass murder has yet to rise to Kissinger
status - Honduras, Libya and Syria notwithstanding - but put her in the
Oval Office and watch the fun!
In light of the above model, the whole Left vs. Right paradigm in modern
U.S. politics presents as a Big Lie.  The only differences I see between
the Parties of our duoploy are rhetorical, and a bias toward
prioritizing service to financial services and communications
shareholder value (Democrats) vs. Petrochemicals and Military
Contracting industries' shareholder value (Republican).
America's real silent majority, our classic Liberals, have no voice in
national policy under a system that locks out candidates for elected
office who do not meet Right Wing (Democratic Party) or Radical Fringe
Right Wing (Republican Party) acceptance criteria.
Meanwhile, thanks to many contributing factors that all come back to
"make money fast, at any human cost," we remain on track for human
extinction.  My own informal model, based on 40 years of obsessive
attention to relevant geophysical data and models, indicates that at
most single digit millions of humans will survive into the 2200s, with
full extinction likely to follow within another century.  Setting an
extinction date presents challenges:  The last humans will live under
conditions similar to long-stay missions to Mars, but with abundant
water and relatively convenient air pressure and temperature as major
advantages.  As on Mars, a few minutes of unprotected exposure "outside"
will be fatal.  One might wish our future Earth Colonists all the best...
But that's another story: Search on NOVA Mass Extinction, then look for
a mirror because WGBS no longer hosts that file.  When I'm really in the
zone, I imagine that plans for Mars missions exist to provide cover for
technology incubators developing methods for human survival under
upcoming atmospheric and etc. conditions right here on Sol III Prime.
"Gentlemen, we can not allow a Mine Shaft Gap!"
vs. we can not afford to put off the business of shutting the
Petrochemicals industry right the fuck down, and fast.  No aboveground
political faction on the Left or Right, so called, will stand for that;
they would literally kill you first, in an effort to discourage others.
 So the final answer is left as a lab exercise... for all the marbles.

In modern usage, the one dimensional Left/Right scale only measures how
stupid, immoral, evil, etc. others are relative to oneself, as a
function of the distance between them and oneself on the scale.  At
least, I have not seen it applied for any other purposes than
demonization or self congratulation.  The complexity of the rhetoric
varies in proportion to the speaker's intelligence and vocabulary.
Oddly enough, in this context the Left/Right scale works the same no
matter which end of that scale gets which label.  That feature enables
people to have endless fun "proving" that whichever end the the scale
they ain't on represents "the REAL Nazis."  The larger the distance
between a given Self and Other, the worse and therefore more "Nazi" the
Other.  One works backward from there to prove the conclusion.
A couple of years ago I made graph similar to the Nolan chart but much
simpler and more concrete, as its axes represent the distribution of
political power in State and Private sectors among larger vs. smaller
numbers of individuals.
The X axis represents distribution of Private power into fewer hands
(Capitalism) or more hands (Free Enterprise).  The Y axis represents
distribution of State power into fewer hands (Authoritarian) or more
hands (Anarchist).  I do not label the quadrants, leaving that as an
exercise.  Examining various "ideologies" in the context of this graph
provides a bit of potentially educational fun.  Which quadrant would you
rather live in, and why?
In this example I place the Right and Left on the graph:
My assignment of "Left" and "Right" to specific coordinates does not
refer to abstract ideological constructs, but rather represents my
observation of the aggregate behavior and practical objectives of people
who strongly self-identify with Right and Left brand labels in the
United States at present.
I like this kind of model because I prefer an ecological approach to
political studies:  I view popular political ideologies as emotionally
loaded verbal formulas used to manipulate people's cognitive processes
and responses to commands, for the speaker's benefit at the audience's
expense.  Conversely, I think of "political reality" as the dynamic
evolution of human power relationships in a changing material
environment over time.  (Lately I have been very gratified to see a
discipline called Biophysical Economics on the rise in academia; I would
describe it as "economics in a world where the laws of physics exist.")
In political rhetoric, Fascism can mean whatever anyone with Fascist
leanings needs it to mean, to pin the label on someone else.  But
academic historians do provide some useful guidelines for the rest of
us.  Dr. Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler
(Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia) and
several Latin American regimes.
Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:
1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make
constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other
paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on
clothing and in public displays.
2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of
enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are
persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of
"need." The people tend to look the other way or even approve of
torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of
prisoners, etc.
3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people
are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate
a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious
minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.
4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic
problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government
funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military
service are glamorized.
5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost
exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender
roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are
suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the
family institution.
6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by
the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled
by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and
executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.
7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational
tool by the government over the masses.
8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist
nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to
manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common
from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are
diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.
9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business
aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the
government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial
business/government relationship and power elite.
10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is
the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either
eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.
11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to
promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia.
It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or
even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.
12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the
police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are
often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties
in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with
virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.
13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are
governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to
government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect
their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes
for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even
outright stolen by government leaders.
14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a
complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns
against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of
legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries,
and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their
judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.

I was under the impression that Nolan came up with that chart in an
effort to persuade people dissatisfied with the Left/Right spectrum that
they "belong in" the Libertarian Party.
I can't fault his motives:  Before the hostile takeover that converted
the Libertarian Party to a Radical Conservative a.k.a. Coprporatist org
back in the late 1990s, the Party had a lot to offer - I was a fan and
booster.  Today, I can not distinguish Libertarian Party advocates and
its (rare) candidates for political office from "socially tolerant"
Republicans.  The Libtards do talk a slightly different game, but I
could not care less about that:  Performance is my bottom line.
That's the X axis on the graph...
I put the Right near the Anarchist end of the scale, because "Private
power" vs. "State power" indicates one central State authority vs.
numerous competitive State-chartered Corporate entities:  Think Soviet
Union vs. United States, toward the end of the Cold War era.
Thanks to several generations of full saturation Big Lie propaganda,
many people believe that Corporate Capitalism "is" Free Enterprise.  But
in real life the two present as natural enemies:  When an independent
sole prop or partnership starts cutting into a major corporation's
market by bringing a superior product to market at a competitive price,
our Corporate Capitalists use their massive financial reserves to
destroy the independent enterprise:  Dump lookalike products on the
market at a loss, regulate their competitors out of business with the
help of friendly, well bribed State agencies, or etc.  This perspective
comes from first hand observation, as a participant in high functioning
small businesses stomped flat as soon as they became competitive by
bringing superior products at completive prices to market.

Very impressive article - Matt Taibbi has clearly been paying
professional attention to the leakage bizniz.  I would guess he did some
in depth research based on the question of how he should proceed if
offered "red hot" classified docs.  Or maybe, after being handed same -
in which case he decided to steer clear.
I only spotted one error:  He attributed the disclosure of NSA tapping
Merkel's phones to Snowden, but that was another actor - likely employed
at NSA in Germany, and a damn sight better at hide and sneak than good
ole Ed.
No duh, as they say.
I'm about two nines confident that Greenwald's Intercept deliberately
burned Reality Winner.  Can incompetence alone account for Intercept
employees contacting the affected organization to 'fact check' the
article in advance of publication by giving away their source's
location, then publishing both the serial number of the printer she
used, and the date/time she printed the documents?  (I pulled the
watermarks off an image I downloaded from The Intercept shortly after
the story broke, using a freeware image editing program.)
Speaking of Greenwald, how about the hatchet job his partner in crime,
Laura Poitras, did on both IO Error and Mendax in her Risk film?  Random
spiteful bitch, or faithful CIA asset?  Either way, fat USIC paycheck
and/or mega-cred in toxic pseudo-feminist circles accomplished.  At
least it's a classier way to attention-whore than punching an alt-Reich
We can't leave out Ed Snowden, international man of mystery.  How early
was he spotted, and to what extent was he manipulated to assure that
specific documents would be among those he handed off to a press
contact?  Hell, DID the published docs come from him?  Given the number
he claims to have handed off, Ed himself would not be likely to know for
How was Snowden's choice of Greenwald assured, and was his life in
danger up to the moment he chose the right non-journalist to pass his
docs off to?  How long did it take him to realize he had been played -
or has he even figured that out yet?  To date his public presentation in
exile remains consistent with making the best of that particular bad
A funny thing happened to the allegedly thousands of documents Ed handed
to Glenn for publication:  After promising Snowden he would release all
the docs within ten days of breaking the first big story, Glenn sold
them all to the highest bidder, Pierre Omidyar.  If Greenwald's claims
about how many docs there were are to be believed, over 99% were either
destroyed, or locked up securely for blackmail use by his new employer.
All I know for sure about the Snoweden Affair is that once the dust
settled, the U.S. intelligence community got everything it wanted:  Not
just authorization to continue illegal domestic surveillance programs,
but a clear precedent that U.S. intelligence officials are allowed to
tell lies under oath in Congressional hearings, with no consequences
other than high-fives back at the office later.  "Almost as if" the USIC
had lots of advance warning and got to pick the specific battles
themselves, with specific purposes in mind.
A suggested leaker's protocol:  Pardon my language but "fuck
journalists."  They need have no role until /after/ all your red hot
docs are in the public domain.
1)  Use an extraordinary physical security protocol to upload an
encrypted archive of your docs to the I2P torrent network.  Clues:  You
need a "clean" laptop from a flea market, a home made high gain antenna,
and a conveniently located open WiFi hot spot.  Don't forget to scramble
your MAC address before plugging in the antenna.  Include one or more
"medium value" docs in the clear, to assure interest in your uploaded
archive.  In your description of the torrent, promise the key will be
published under the same user name within a given time frame.
2)  A few days later, use the same security protocol, from a location at
least hundreds of miles away from your first upload site, to post the
key (a pass phrase, see diceware.com) on the same torrent tracker site
in I2P space.
3)  Destroy everything used in the above process, and resume your
"normal" life.  Mission accomplished, you got the docs into more than
enough hands to assure public release at /minimal/ personal risk.
Better alternatives to this protocol are solicited...
And remember, on the day you brag about your success start a countdown
timer to your arrest and conviction, if not death by natural causes.

The "feminazis" you refer to do exist; they originated in the New Left,
a USIC political warfare project intended to displace and discredit
Pacifist and Liberal voices in broadcast media during the Vietnam War.
The folks who started the "feminazi" bullshit were from that same crew.
The project was successful, and after the war the New Left never went
away.  They kept working their professional networks and press contacts,
and re-emerged as the Progressives in the late 70s - early 80s.  They
now own and operate the DNC, and through that org, most of the
Democratic Party.
Real feminists also exist.  They typically associate with anarchists and
their ilk, and one finds plenty of them in Occupy-related activist orgs.
 Check Emma Goldman, Lucy Parsons and Simone de Beauvoir for background
on "real" feminism.
If so, neither he nor anyone else has ever said so.  The Snowden Saga,
if at all factual, leaves no room for that to have happened.
Played how?  Spotted early by the fairly massive Insider Threat programs
at NSA, initiated in response to Chelsea Manning's work.  They may have
fed him specific documents, kept away from others, transferred him from
job to job as necessary to facilitate that process.  He may have also
been monitored and/or manipulated through his girlfriend, who has joined
him in exile - which makes little sense, unless she had something to
hide, and/or run from, here in the U.S.
I figure Snowden for too dumb to 'leak correctly,' but too smart not to
play along once he became an object of property physically passed around
between ruling class factions.
So at least one article published within days of the Prism release said.
 Over the next week the reported number of documents given to Greenwald
rose very fast, as Greenwald's story changed.  I kept very close track
of available information during that time frame; this article I wrote
back then be of some historical interest:
"By his own account, Snowden often discussed perceived Agency wrongdoing
with his co-workers, which suggests that he should have been profiled
and flagged as a potential leaker by the NSA’s internal surveillance
To date, no "missing" Snowden docs have turned up anywhere.  Considering
their cash value to any reporter who has an "exclusive" on any of them,
that seems very unlikely if any did exist.
Anything but useless:  Whether or not Snowden was in on the game, the
Snowden Affair accomplished important IC objectives, solidifying their
power as an autocratic branch of government answerable to no one but
Mostly to create extra interest in the archive's contents:  Woo, big
The leaker can passively observe activity on the tracker(s) and in
related forums, and release the key when it appears that the docs have
spread too far to hunt down and eradicate.  In a case where the content
of the archive would constitute a "national emergency" in the eyes of
our intelligence services, best to avoid starting that firestorm until
they are in at least dozens of hands, scattered around the world, to
light that fire.
Anyone clever enough to do any of the above, will find ways to improve
on it:  For instance nested encrypted archives, where peeling each layer
open yields more valuable documents than the layer before.  What new
wonders will the next key reveal?!
One could even SELL the last key for a healthy chunk of BTC, although
(nyah ha) maybe that last zip.gpg archive only has PDFs of some old MAD
Magazines, as a gesture of contempt for anyone willing to pay big money
for an "exclusive."  It may be possible to sell /several/ copies of the
same key to competing bidders.  Nobody in a position to pay would be in
a big hurry to tell the world they got chumped.

If we ask what specific domestic surveillance activities had already
caused the most controversy, and had the biggest potential for blowback
if exposed to full public view, "the first two Snowden releases"
provides a pretty good answer:  Bulk surveillance of U.S. telephone and
Internet traffic.
Programs that large will eventually become public knowledge.  Picking
how and when that happens, and preparing responses for the press,
Congress and the Courts in advance, presents significant advantages.
This permits developing and implementing strategies for influencing
specific individuals who would play key roles in determining the outcome
in publicity, political and legal dimensions (reporters and editors,
Senators and DemoPublican Party officials, Fedeeral Prosecutors and
During and after the initial releases from the Snowden Saga, the
intelligence community won nearly every battle over who can break what
laws, when, etc. without consequences.  The Snowden Affair removed many
potential liabilities by establishing that "we are allowed to do this,
that and the other thing."
Available biographical information, and his extraordinary access to
numerous "sensitive compartments", indicates his job was most likely
senior IT administrator and troubleshooter at facilities handling
classified communications and databases.
Then again, available biographical information indicates that the guy
with the "pencil neck geek" physique volunteered for and was accepted
for training for Special Forces while before he completed Basic Training
- which does not happen.  He then supposedly received a medical
discharge after breaking both legs in a training accident, which again
does not happen except where the such injuries qualify as disabling.
That's why I call Snowden an International Man Of Mystery rather than
any other title:  Not only is he a living legend, what we can see of
that life looks like a "legend" in the sense of an intelligence
officer's fake back story related to a particular assignment.
Why did Snowden pick attorney and political commentator Glenn Greenwald
to hand his documents off to, instead of a journalist?  Why not contact
John Young, Sibel Edmonds, an old timer like Daniel Ellsberg - or ANYONE
with applicable knowledge and experience?  Did he fail to look into the
history of leaks like the one he was considering, and available venues
for same - or was he directed to specific people spotted, recruited and
handled by the same employer who spotted, developed and handled him?
I doubt that we will never know.
Snowden said:
“When you see everything, you see them on a more frequent basis and you
recognize that some of these things are actually abuses, and when you
talk about them in a place like this, were this is the normal state of
business, people tend not to take them very seriously and move on from
them. But over time that awareness of wrongdoing sort of builds up and
you feel compelled to talk about it, and the more you talk about it, the
more you’re ignored, the more you’re told it’s not a problem...”
Security axiom:  "A trusted party is one who can break your security
The covert services consider "trust" a valuable and dangerous commodity,
and ration it with exceptional care.  Snowden apparently had
exceptionally broad access to classified documents stored on computer
systems, so whatever his job description it would qualify him for
additional scrutiny compared to those who are permitted only to see
information directly related to their specific assignments.
The Presidential directive establishing the Insider Threat Program,
nearly two years before the Snowden Affair:
Somebody gave Spiegel some very interesting docs, including materials
apparently dating after Snowden's releases and exile.  As a night vs.
day difference, the docs published by Spiegel included materials
describing NSA tools in considerable detail, and information exposing
U.S. surveillance of the Chancellor's phones.
Clueless mainstream journalists and the public at large have "assumed"
that these documents somehow came from Ed Snowden.  Spook watchers know
better:  These docs alerted the world to previously unknown "hacking"
techniques used by NSA and its government customers, and they did
significant damage to U.S. political and influence operations in progress.

Not at all.  Spook Watchers and political dissidents knew about them,
through bits and pieces of hard data and well informed speculation.  The
broader general public had moderately paranoid suspicions, but it was
all conveniently deniable until The Snowden Affair.
Ed himself modeled the desired public reaction perfectly, almost as if
coached in advance:  "Grave concern" with just a slight touch of
outrage, in a context assuming that "the government should" obey the law.
Precedents set and settled by the Snowden Affair:
- Bulk surveillance of 'private' U.S. communication is legal
- Breaking into the computers of Congressional staff during an
investigation of IC criminal conduct is not prosecuted
- Lying under oath during Congressional hearings is not prosecuted.
... all in the name of National Security.
Could be.  Doesn't matter much though...
Not so much implausible as impossible:  Violations of policy and
procedure, because recruit Snowden was so special... why?
Unless his legend really is true, which seems very unlikely to me,
probably so.
He's an attorney by trade, Progressive political policy advocate by
vocation.  As far as I know, he has never been employed by any news
organization, and has never gathered information in the field or written
a published report.  My one item published at Global Research makes me
more of a "journalist" than him, LOL.
In the wake of the Manning scandal, someone with Snowden's apparent
all-access back stage pass would not likely be ignored, if as he said he
had a habit of talking about what his employers were doing as "abuses".
 Especially not when the Insider Threat program was new and, itself, a
topic of concern at the activities Snowden worked for.
Still, I agree he might have been ignored.  "Military intelligence is a
contradiction in terms."
Ya got me there, I'm gonna have to do some digging one of these days to
check whether I do recall correctly about some of those docs' content
indicating they were dated after Snowden's exile.  Not being a
'journalist' myself, I rarely keep detailed notes and often discard them
after use when I do.

Good one.  :o)
I do approve of Phil Agee - I literally shook his hand and thanked him
for his service - but he was not a Nice Man.  What he saw the U.S. doing
in Latin America - sponsoring and directing State terror campaigns
against opponents of U.S. backed totalitarian governments - pushed Agee
over to the Commie side.  He believed that the USSR and its allies
presented the only hope for relief from the U.S. reign of terror in
various countries south of the U.S. border.  Apparently it was the
systematic use of torture and murder to make examples of political
activists that really got to him.
Where widespread concerns about setting precedents negating First
Amendment press protections kept Agee from being prosecuted, Assange
already has "secret" U.S. criminal charges.  The charges against Assange
probably assert that he "conspired" with Russian Federation intelligence
agencies to harm the U.S. National Interest.
This tells us a lot about the evolution of U.S. public policy in the
years between:  Agee personally collected and published very damaging
classified information; Assange has only published materials provided by
others.  Agee committed criminal offenses under U.S. law; Assange is an
Australian under no legal obligation to obey any U.S. chain of command's
orders.  By the late 1980s Agee was free to travel and speak in the
United States.  If Assange sets foot outside the Ecuadorian embassy, a
joint US/British team already in place will snatch him and ship him to
the United States for a show trial.
What defensive strategies will Assange use going forward?  That's hard
to guess.  But I would suggest that anyone who approves of Wikileaks'
work, and happens to have access to damaging information related to the
individuals who would be personally involved in prosecuting Assange, can
contribute by collecting as much of that information as possible and
sending it along to Wikileaks.

Ignorant, easily led Trump supporters believe he opposes the Deep State.
 Intelligent, well paid Trump supporters understand that his whole job,
and by extension theirs, is to give the Deep State exactly what it wants
at all times.  To understand this one must understand the difference
between what propagandists working the alt-Right crowd mean when they
say "Deep State," and what academics who study political systems mean
when they say "Deep State."  The closer one looks, the smaller the
similarity becomes - until it disappears completely.
In contemporary propaganda, the term Deep State refers to an hereditary
Conspiracy of evil individuals, well known to true believers who take
every Conspiracy Theory with any paranoid and/or racist content as rock
solid fact.  Their version of the Deep State works tirelessly to destroy
everything white working class conservative Christians consider right,
good and holy.  For full details of this version of the Deep State,
enter 'illuminati new world order' in any search engine.
In political science, the term Deep State refers to the army of career
civil servants, appointed officials, and private contractors who conduct
the government's actual business.  Collectively, they have many shared
interests and agendas; and without their advice, consent and
cooperation, elected officials can not get anything done.  This gives
the government as a whole huge inertia, a tendency to "keep doing what
it has always done" regardless of popular demand for change, or
unwelcome policy directives from elected officials.
Below:  Four essays introducing and explaining various aspects of the
real Deep State.  Or in other words, the original Deep State concept our
alt-Right propagandists borrowed their new, improved name for the
Illuminati / New World Order Conspiracy from.
"There is the visible government situated around the Mall in Washington,
and then there is another, more shadowy, more indefinable government
that is not explained in Civics 101 or observable to tourists at the
White House or the Capitol. The former is traditional Washington
partisan politics: the tip of the iceberg that a public watching C-SPAN
sees daily and which is theoretically controllable via elections. The
subsurface part of the iceberg I shall call the Deep State, which
operates according to its own compass heading regardless of who is
formally in power."
"The Deep State is not just the military intelligence community, but
also consists of transnational corporations, big business and Big Oil,
Wall Street, Silicon Valley, and think tanks. Groups and institutions in
this structure form various coalitions that can compete, but tend to
seek agreement on certain fundamental policies that benefit their mutual
positions of power."
“Trump’s not Sir Galahad against the evil Deep State. Of course, they
completely ignore the fact that, one, he’s a product of it – that whole
New York high finance world is one adjunct of the Deep State. Second,
Trump showed it to us with his cabinet picks for the economy. And third,
he is advocating a 10 percent increase in military spending. How could

"The United States has, in short, moved beyond a mere imperial
presidency to a bifurcated system — a structure of double government —
in which even the President now exercises little substantive control
over the overall direction of U.S. national security policy. Whereas
Britain’s dual institutions evolved towards a concealed republic,
America’s have evolved in the opposite direction, toward greater
centralization, less accountability, and emergent autocracy."

vs. point out to them where the curriculum veers off into popular
misconceptions and/or propaganda messaging, and provide access to
supplemental information where and as indicated.
"Brick and mortar" school teaches three lessons of great importance:
1)  Show up on time every day whether you want to or not.
2)  Do your assigned tasks as directed whether you want to or not.
3)  The people in charge always have all the final answers.
Any other lessons learned present as added value for the economic and
political actors who will exploit obedience trained public school
inmates for the rest of their lives.
The process of sorting future winners and losers includes giving higher
quality instruction to the more obedient kids, while treating the less
obedient as stupid and providing them with a "for losers" curriculum.
More recently, drugging noncompliant students has joined the mix of
strategies for shaping and limiting the social and political impact of
"disruptive" personalities in tomorrow's crop of adults.
"But what about socialization?"  What indeed - see above for the kind of
socialization public schools provide.  It took 40 years to build a
climate of fear sufficient to support literally outlawing normal,
organic socialization, i.e. letting your kids run around with the
neighbor kids.  As a result, public school and broadcast media get the
final say as formative social influences on the peer relationships of
tomorrow's adult consumers - except where parents remove public school
from the mix and work to replace it with "real world" social development

Ah, the Progressives!  I first got to know them back when they were
called the New Left:  Think "Hanoi" Jane Fonda & co.  Over the years my
on-contact categorical rejection of the New Left's message evolved into
a personal theory that they were, wittingly or otherwise, fielded by a
Federal domestic political warfare activity.  Their mission:  Displace
and discredit Pacifists and Liberals who were getting way too much
influence during the Vietnam War.  As always in mass media, nothing
attracts attention like violence, even if it's only violent and
deliberately offensive rhetoric; the plan, if plan it was, worked very
In this same time frame, COINTELPRO was A Thing and the FBI went so far
as to provide training, money, arms and explosives to Militant Leftists,
creating "shocking headlines" in an effort to equate anti-war and other
Liberal / ComSymp sentiments with violent extremism in the public mind.
 In light of the FBI arranging for people to actually bomb banks and
such, it would be absurd to imagine that they did not also field double
agents, witting or witless, to present a stereotyped "made to be hated"
pro-Commie, anti-American "Leftist" message to the Folks At Home.
A funny thing happened after the Vietnam War:  The New Left still had
its press contacts and professional networks, and kept right on going.
After a few years of dormancy, Hanoi Jane married a conventional
politician and got a faux Liberal makeover.  At about that time I
started running into people in real life who presented as political
activists and talked about "political correctness" as if they had some
moral right to dictate what Liberals and Radicals could and could not
think, say and do.  My initial reaction was "fuck y'all." Subsequent
experience has proved my instinctive anarchist response correct.
The Progressives worked industriously through the Reagan years, and
managed to take over key roles in the Democratic Party.  They elected
one of their own - The Clintons - to the Presidency.  Did the old New
Left do that on their own, or with assistance from our Security
Services?  I have no hard data on that, but need I mention the
relationship established when the CIA obtained full support from
Governor Clinton for the Iran/Contra cocaine trafficking business, and
the infamous Clinton Body Count from that era?  Since before that day to
the present, Progressive political actors have worked hand in glove with
radical fringe Right Wing extremist elements of our "Deep State."
The Clintons' zero-tolerance policy toward folks like the Patriot
Movement (who remembers Ruby Ridge?), and the mass murder they carried
out in Wayco, Texas do not impress me as evidence of an anti-Right
agenda.  I see a commitment to Corporate interests who dictate a zero
tolerance policy toward any kind of wildcat political organizing, not
under the firm control of well entrenched, uber-wealthy factions in the
U.S. political/economic ecology.
Today our peasants outnumber our dominant aristocrats by about 3/4
million to one, and that can't be a comfortable position for a de facto
criminal elite to find itself in.  Populism presents an existential
threat to the world as they know it - a world where less than
1/100,000th of the population literally makes all the decisions
affecting our species as a whole.  So it can't be allowed, is all.
Anyone who doubts the identity vs. "close relationship" of the
Progressive establishment with the Far Right needs only look into the
relationship between Henry Kissinger and Hillary Clinton:  They present
themselves in public as best buddies, and Hillary calls him her mentor.
 Her own track record for mass murder has yet to rise to Kissinger
status - Honduras, Libya and Syria notwithstanding - but put her in the
Oval Office and watch the fun!
In light of the above model, the whole Left vs. Right paradigm in modern
U.S. politics presents as a Big Lie.  The only differences I see between
the Parties of our duoploy are rhetorical, and a bias toward
prioritizing service to financial services and communications
shareholder value (Democrats) vs. Petrochemicals and Military
Contracting industries' shareholder value (Republican).
America's real silent majority, our classic Liberals, have no voice in
national policy under a system that locks out candidates for elected
office who do not meet Right Wing (Democratic Party) or Radical Fringe
Right Wing (Republican Party) acceptance criteria.
Meanwhile, thanks to many contributing factors that all come back to
"make money fast, at any human cost," we remain on track for human
extinction.  My own informal model, based on 40 years of obsessive
attention to relevant geophysical data and models, indicates that at
most single digit millions of humans will survive into the 2200s, with
full extinction likely to follow within another century.  Setting an
extinction date presents challenges:  The last humans will live under
conditions similar to long-stay missions to Mars, but with abundant
water and relatively convenient air pressure and temperature as major
advantages.  As on Mars, a few minutes of unprotected exposure "outside"
will be fatal.  One might wish our future Earth Colonists all the best...
But that's another story: Search on NOVA Mass Extinction, then look for
a mirror because WGBS no longer hosts that file.  When I'm really in the
zone, I imagine that plans for Mars missions exist to provide cover for
technology incubators developing methods for human survival under
upcoming atmospheric and etc. conditions right here on Sol III Prime.
"Gentlemen, we can not allow a Mine Shaft Gap!"
vs. we can not afford to put off the business of shutting the
Petrochemicals industry right the fuck down, and fast.  No aboveground
political faction on the Left or Right, so called, will stand for that;
they would literally kill you first, in an effort to discourage others.
 So the final answer is left as a lab exercise... for all the marbles.

In modern usage, the one dimensional Left/Right scale only measures how
stupid, immoral, evil, etc. others are relative to oneself, as a
function of the distance between them and oneself on the scale.  At
least, I have not seen it applied for any other purposes than
demonization or self congratulation.  The complexity of the rhetoric
varies in proportion to the speaker's intelligence and vocabulary.
Oddly enough, in this context the Left/Right scale works the same no
matter which end of that scale gets which label.  That feature enables
people to have endless fun "proving" that whichever end the the scale
they ain't on represents "the REAL Nazis."  The larger the distance
between a given Self and Other, the worse and therefore more "Nazi" the
Other.  One works backward from there to prove the conclusion.
A couple of years ago I made graph similar to the Nolan chart but much
simpler and more concrete, as its axes represent the distribution of
political power in State and Private sectors among larger vs. smaller
numbers of individuals.
The X axis represents distribution of Private power into fewer hands
(Capitalism) or more hands (Free Enterprise).  The Y axis represents
distribution of State power into fewer hands (Authoritarian) or more
hands (Anarchist).  I do not label the quadrants, leaving that as an
exercise.  Examining various "ideologies" in the context of this graph
provides a bit of potentially educational fun.  Which quadrant would you
rather live in, and why?
In this example I place the Right and Left on the graph:
My assignment of "Left" and "Right" to specific coordinates does not
refer to abstract ideological constructs, but rather represents my
observation of the aggregate behavior and practical objectives of people
who strongly self-identify with Right and Left brand labels in the
United States at present.
I like this kind of model because I prefer an ecological approach to
political studies:  I view popular political ideologies as emotionally
loaded verbal formulas used to manipulate people's cognitive processes
and responses to commands, for the speaker's benefit at the audience's
expense.  Conversely, I think of "political reality" as the dynamic
evolution of human power relationships in a changing material
environment over time.  (Lately I have been very gratified to see a
discipline called Biophysical Economics on the rise in academia; I would
describe it as "economics in a world where the laws of physics exist.")
In political rhetoric, Fascism can mean whatever anyone with Fascist
leanings needs it to mean, to pin the label on someone else.  But
academic historians do provide some useful guidelines for the rest of
us.  Dr. Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler
(Germany), Mussolini (Italy), Franco (Spain), Suharto (Indonesia) and
several Latin American regimes.
Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:
1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make
constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other
paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on
clothing and in public displays.
2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of
enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are
persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of
"need." The people tend to look the other way or even approve of
torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of
prisoners, etc.
3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people
are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate
a perceived common threat or foe: racial, ethnic or religious
minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.
4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic
problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government
funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military
service are glamorized.
5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost
exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender
roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are
suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the
family institution.
6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by
the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled
by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and
executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.
7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational
tool by the government over the masses.
8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist
nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to
manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common
from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are
diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.
9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business
aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the
government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial
business/government relationship and power elite.
10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is
the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either
eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.
11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to
promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia.
It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or
even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.
12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the
police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are
often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties
in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with
virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.
13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are
governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to
government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect
their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes
for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even
outright stolen by government leaders.
14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a
complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns
against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of
legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries,
and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their
judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.

I was under the impression that Nolan came up with that chart in an
effort to persuade people dissatisfied with the Left/Right spectrum that
they "belong in" the Libertarian Party.
I can't fault his motives:  Before the hostile takeover that converted
the Libertarian Party to a Radical Conservative a.k.a. Coprporatist org
back in the late 1990s, the Party had a lot to offer - I was a fan and
booster.  Today, I can not distinguish Libertarian Party advocates and
its (rare) candidates for political office from "socially tolerant"
Republicans.  The Libtards do talk a slightly different game, but I
could not care less about that:  Performance is my bottom line.
That's the X axis on the graph...
I put the Right near the Anarchist end of the scale, because "Private
power" vs. "State power" indicates one central State authority vs.
numerous competitive State-chartered Corporate entities:  Think Soviet
Union vs. United States, toward the end of the Cold War era.
Thanks to several generations of full saturation Big Lie propaganda,
many people believe that Corporate Capitalism "is" Free Enterprise.  But
in real life the two present as natural enemies:  When an independent
sole prop or partnership starts cutting into a major corporation's
market by bringing a superior product to market at a competitive price,
our Corporate Capitalists use their massive financial reserves to
destroy the independent enterprise:  Dump lookalike products on the
market at a loss, regulate their competitors out of business with the
help of friendly, well bribed State agencies, or etc.  This perspective
comes from first hand observation, as a participant in high functioning
small businesses stomped flat as soon as they became competitive by
bringing superior products at completive prices to market.

NovaSAR-S provides medium resolution (6-30 m) imagery ideal for

In terms of this gadget's potential for military and State Security

Very impressive article - Matt Taibbi has clearly been paying
professional attention to the leakage bizniz.  I would guess he did some
in depth research based on the question of how he should proceed if
offered "red hot" classified docs.  Or maybe, after being handed same -
in which case he decided to steer clear.
I only spotted one error:  He attributed the disclosure of NSA tapping
Merkel's phones to Snowden, but that was another actor - likely employed
at NSA in Germany, and a damn sight better at hide and sneak than good
ole Ed.
No duh, as they say.
I'm about two nines confident that Greenwald's Intercept deliberately
burned Reality Winner.  Can incompetence alone account for Intercept
employees contacting the affected organization to 'fact check' the
article in advance of publication by giving away their source's
location, then publishing both the serial number of the printer she
used, and the date/time she printed the documents?  (I pulled the
watermarks off an image I downloaded from The Intercept shortly after
the story broke, using a freeware image editing program.)
Speaking of Greenwald, how about the hatchet job his partner in crime,
Laura Poitras, did on both IO Error and Mendax in her Risk film?  Random
spiteful bitch, or faithful CIA asset?  Either way, fat USIC paycheck
and/or mega-cred in toxic pseudo-feminist circles accomplished.  At
least it's a classier way to attention-whore than punching an alt-Reich
We can't leave out Ed Snowden, international man of mystery.  How early
was he spotted, and to what extent was he manipulated to assure that
specific documents would be among those he handed off to a press
contact?  Hell, DID the published docs come from him?  Given the number
he claims to have handed off, Ed himself would not be likely to know for
How was Snowden's choice of Greenwald assured, and was his life in
danger up to the moment he chose the right non-journalist to pass his
docs off to?  How long did it take him to realize he had been played -
or has he even figured that out yet?  To date his public presentation in
exile remains consistent with making the best of that particular bad
A funny thing happened to the allegedly thousands of documents Ed handed
to Glenn for publication:  After promising Snowden he would release all
the docs within ten days of breaking the first big story, Glenn sold
them all to the highest bidder, Pierre Omidyar.  If Greenwald's claims
about how many docs there were are to be believed, over 99% were either
destroyed, or locked up securely for blackmail use by his new employer.
All I know for sure about the Snoweden Affair is that once the dust
settled, the U.S. intelligence community got everything it wanted:  Not
just authorization to continue illegal domestic surveillance programs,
but a clear precedent that U.S. intelligence officials are allowed to
tell lies under oath in Congressional hearings, with no consequences
other than high-fives back at the office later.  "Almost as if" the USIC
had lots of advance warning and got to pick the specific battles
themselves, with specific purposes in mind.
A suggested leaker's protocol:  Pardon my language but "fuck
journalists."  They need have no role until /after/ all your red hot
docs are in the public domain.
1)  Use an extraordinary physical security protocol to upload an
encrypted archive of your docs to the I2P torrent network.  Clues:  You
need a "clean" laptop from a flea market, a home made high gain antenna,
and a conveniently located open WiFi hot spot.  Don't forget to scramble
your MAC address before plugging in the antenna.  Include one or more
"medium value" docs in the clear, to assure interest in your uploaded
archive.  In your description of the torrent, promise the key will be
published under the same user name within a given time frame.
2)  A few days later, use the same security protocol, from a location at
least hundreds of miles away from your first upload site, to post the
key (a pass phrase, see diceware.com) on the same torrent tracker site
in I2P space.
3)  Destroy everything used in the above process, and resume your
"normal" life.  Mission accomplished, you got the docs into more than
enough hands to assure public release at /minimal/ personal risk.
Better alternatives to this protocol are solicited...
And remember, on the day you brag about your success start a countdown
timer to your arrest and conviction, if not death by natural causes.

The "feminazis" you refer to do exist; they originated in the New Left,
a USIC political warfare project intended to displace and discredit
Pacifist and Liberal voices in broadcast media during the Vietnam War.
The folks who started the "feminazi" bullshit were from that same crew.
The project was successful, and after the war the New Left never went
away.  They kept working their professional networks and press contacts,
and re-emerged as the Progressives in the late 70s - early 80s.  They
now own and operate the DNC, and through that org, most of the
Democratic Party.
Real feminists also exist.  They typically associate with anarchists and
their ilk, and one finds plenty of them in Occupy-related activist orgs.
 Check Emma Goldman, Lucy Parsons and Simone de Beauvoir for background
on "real" feminism.
If so, neither he nor anyone else has ever said so.  The Snowden Saga,
if at all factual, leaves no room for that to have happened.
Played how?  Spotted early by the fairly massive Insider Threat programs
at NSA, initiated in response to Chelsea Manning's work.  They may have
fed him specific documents, kept away from others, transferred him from
job to job as necessary to facilitate that process.  He may have also
been monitored and/or manipulated through his girlfriend, who has joined
him in exile - which makes little sense, unless she had something to
hide, and/or run from, here in the U.S.
I figure Snowden for too dumb to 'leak correctly,' but too smart not to
play along once he became an object of property physically passed around
between ruling class factions.
So at least one article published within days of the Prism release said.
 Over the next week the reported number of documents given to Greenwald
rose very fast, as Greenwald's story changed.  I kept very close track
of available information during that time frame; this article I wrote
back then be of some historical interest:
"By his own account, Snowden often discussed perceived Agency wrongdoing
with his co-workers, which suggests that he should have been profiled
and flagged as a potential leaker by the NSA’s internal surveillance
To date, no "missing" Snowden docs have turned up anywhere.  Considering
their cash value to any reporter who has an "exclusive" on any of them,
that seems very unlikely if any did exist.
Anything but useless:  Whether or not Snowden was in on the game, the
Snowden Affair accomplished important IC objectives, solidifying their
power as an autocratic branch of government answerable to no one but
Mostly to create extra interest in the archive's contents:  Woo, big
The leaker can passively observe activity on the tracker(s) and in
related forums, and release the key when it appears that the docs have
spread too far to hunt down and eradicate.  In a case where the content
of the archive would constitute a "national emergency" in the eyes of
our intelligence services, best to avoid starting that firestorm until
they are in at least dozens of hands, scattered around the world, to
light that fire.
Anyone clever enough to do any of the above, will find ways to improve
on it:  For instance nested encrypted archives, where peeling each layer
open yields more valuable documents than the layer before.  What new
wonders will the next key reveal?!
One could even SELL the last key for a healthy chunk of BTC, although
(nyah ha) maybe that last zip.gpg archive only has PDFs of some old MAD
Magazines, as a gesture of contempt for anyone willing to pay big money
for an "exclusive."  It may be possible to sell /several/ copies of the
same key to competing bidders.  Nobody in a position to pay would be in
a big hurry to tell the world they got chumped.

If we ask what specific domestic surveillance activities had already
caused the most controversy, and had the biggest potential for blowback
if exposed to full public view, "the first two Snowden releases"
provides a pretty good answer:  Bulk surveillance of U.S. telephone and
Internet traffic.
Programs that large will eventually become public knowledge.  Picking
how and when that happens, and preparing responses for the press,
Congress and the Courts in advance, presents significant advantages.
This permits developing and implementing strategies for influencing
specific individuals who would play key roles in determining the outcome
in publicity, political and legal dimensions (reporters and editors,
Senators and DemoPublican Party officials, Fedeeral Prosecutors and
During and after the initial releases from the Snowden Saga, the
intelligence community won nearly every battle over who can break what
laws, when, etc. without consequences.  The Snowden Affair removed many
potential liabilities by establishing that "we are allowed to do this,
that and the other thing."
Available biographical information, and his extraordinary access to
numerous "sensitive compartments", indicates his job was most likely
senior IT administrator and troubleshooter at facilities handling
classified communications and databases.
Then again, available biographical information indicates that the guy
with the "pencil neck geek" physique volunteered for and was accepted
for training for Special Forces while before he completed Basic Training
- which does not happen.  He then supposedly received a medical
discharge after breaking both legs in a training accident, which again
does not happen except where the such injuries qualify as disabling.
That's why I call Snowden an International Man Of Mystery rather than
any other title:  Not only is he a living legend, what we can see of
that life looks like a "legend" in the sense of an intelligence
officer's fake back story related to a particular assignment.
Why did Snowden pick attorney and political commentator Glenn Greenwald
to hand his documents off to, instead of a journalist?  Why not contact
John Young, Sibel Edmonds, an old timer like Daniel Ellsberg - or ANYONE
with applicable knowledge and experience?  Did he fail to look into the
history of leaks like the one he was considering, and available venues
for same - or was he directed to specific people spotted, recruited and
handled by the same employer who spotted, developed and handled him?
I doubt that we will never know.
Snowden said:
“When you see everything, you see them on a more frequent basis and you
recognize that some of these things are actually abuses, and when you
talk about them in a place like this, were this is the normal state of
business, people tend not to take them very seriously and move on from
them. But over time that awareness of wrongdoing sort of builds up and
you feel compelled to talk about it, and the more you talk about it, the
more you’re ignored, the more you’re told it’s not a problem...”
Security axiom:  "A trusted party is one who can break your security
The covert services consider "trust" a valuable and dangerous commodity,
and ration it with exceptional care.  Snowden apparently had
exceptionally broad access to classified documents stored on computer
systems, so whatever his job description it would qualify him for
additional scrutiny compared to those who are permitted only to see
information directly related to their specific assignments.
The Presidential directive establishing the Insider Threat Program,

Somebody gave Spiegel some very interesting docs, including materials
apparently dating after Snowden's releases and exile.  As a night vs.
day difference, the docs published by Spiegel included materials
describing NSA tools in considerable detail, and information exposing
U.S. surveillance of the Chancellor's phones.
Clueless mainstream journalists and the public at large have "assumed"
that these documents somehow came from Ed Snowden.  Spook watchers know
better:  These docs alerted the world to previously unknown "hacking"
techniques used by NSA and its government customers, and they did
significant damage to U.S. political and influence operations in progress.

Not at all.  Spook Watchers and political dissidents knew about them,
through bits and pieces of hard data and well informed speculation.  The
broader general public had moderately paranoid suspicions, but it was
all conveniently deniable until The Snowden Affair.
Ed himself modeled the desired public reaction perfectly, almost as if
coached in advance:  "Grave concern" with just a slight touch of
outrage, in a context assuming that "the government should" obey the law.
Precedents set and settled by the Snowden Affair:
- Bulk surveillance of 'private' U.S. communication is legal
- Breaking into the computers of Congressional staff during an
investigation of IC criminal conduct is not prosecuted
- Lying under oath during Congressional hearings is not prosecuted.
... all in the name of National Security.
Could be.  Doesn't matter much though...
Not so much implausible as impossible:  Violations of policy and
procedure, because recruit Snowden was so special... why?
Unless his legend really is true, which seems very unlikely to me,
probably so.
He's an attorney by trade, Progressive political policy advocate by
vocation.  As far as I know, he has never been employed by any news
organization, and has never gathered information in the field or written
a published report.  My one item published at Global Research makes me
more of a "journalist" than him, LOL.
In the wake of the Manning scandal, someone with Snowden's apparent
all-access back stage pass would not likely be ignored, if as he said he
had a habit of talking about what his employers were doing as "abuses".
 Especially not when the Insider Threat program was new and, itself, a
topic of concern at the activities Snowden worked for.
Still, I agree he might have been ignored.  "Military intelligence is a
contradiction in terms."
Ya got me there, I'm gonna have to do some digging one of these days to
check whether I do recall correctly about some of those docs' content
indicating they were dated after Snowden's exile.  Not being a
'journalist' myself, I rarely keep detailed notes and often discard them
after use when I do.

Good one.  :o)
I do approve of Phil Agee - I literally shook his hand and thanked him
for his service - but he was not a Nice Man.  What he saw the U.S. doing
in Latin America - sponsoring and directing State terror campaigns
against opponents of U.S. backed totalitarian governments - pushed Agee
over to the Commie side.  He believed that the USSR and its allies
presented the only hope for relief from the U.S. reign of terror in
various countries south of the U.S. border.  Apparently it was the
systematic use of torture and murder to make examples of political
activists that really got to him.
Where widespread concerns about setting precedents negating First
Amendment press protections kept Agee from being prosecuted, Assange
already has "secret" U.S. criminal charges.  The charges against Assange
probably assert that he "conspired" with Russian Federation intelligence
agencies to harm the U.S. National Interest.
This tells us a lot about the evolution of U.S. public policy in the
years between:  Agee personally collected and published very damaging
classified information; Assange has only published materials provided by
others.  Agee committed criminal offenses under U.S. law; Assange is an
Australian under no legal obligation to obey any U.S. chain of command's
orders.  By the late 1980s Agee was free to travel and speak in the
United States.  If Assange sets foot outside the Ecuadorian embassy, a
joint US/British team already in place will snatch him and ship him to
the United States for a show trial.
What defensive strategies will Assange use going forward?  That's hard
to guess.  But I would suggest that anyone who approves of Wikileaks'
work, and happens to have access to damaging information related to the
individuals who would be personally involved in prosecuting Assange, can
contribute by collecting as much of that information as possible and
sending it along to Wikileaks.

Well heck, CDs are cheap.  Write once, use once, melt once.  If your
trust in the Live CD vendor and the "trusted" device used to burn your
stack of Live OS CDs is well founded, and the device booted into has no
drive (or a power switch on the drive - a very trivial hack even with a

modules on the CPU, and maybe undocumented BIOS or video chip features.
If your activities present a target important enough to justify use of
TS/SCI techniques against you, your activities are probably important
enough to justify purchasing obsolete laptops in bulk and destroying
each after one use.  "Fingerprint MY hardware will ya, you bastards?
HA!  Take that!"  Just sayin'.
Everything depends largely on one's threat model.  Who are your
potential adversaries, what are their potential resources, and what's
their cost/benefit ratio for doing what it takes to crack your system?
Educated guesses here establish parameters for reasonable defensive
measures also based on cost/benefit factors.  Spoiler:  For most of the

Always consider that the cost of using information obtained via a

TOR schmore.  I would describe i2p as an anonymizing torrent
distribution network, with some other comms (in-network websites,
e-mail, etc.) piggybacking on the infrastructure that file sharing
traffic keeps up and running.
The Garlic Routing protocol used by i2p looks at least as secure as
Onion Routing - and IMO more so, because of both the protocol's
architecture, and the dynamics of real world traffic flow where a small
number of "dangerous" packets mix into a huge number of movies, TV
shows, record albums etc. in transit.  Extra paranoid users can
configure i2p to use longer chains, further complicating things for
adversaries.  By default all i2p nodes relay third party traffic, and at
present no (advertised) gateways connect i2p to the 'regular' Internet.
The high volume of torrent traffic over i2p, and the loooong duration of
typical downloads (25kbps counts as 'decent speed' in there), greatly
complicate matters for anyone doing traffic analysis, compared to the
hit-and-run pattern of TOR usage that typically lights up an entry and
exit router for just a few minutes per user session, during which easily
fingerprinted clusters of packets, all of them "of interest" to
potential adversaries, flow thick and fast.
The most reliable anonymity against State level adversaries uses TOR for
hit-and-run network access via a high gain antenna and open router, or
any dodge that physically decouples the user from the physical router's
IP address.  i2p can't do that very well, because it takes 20 minutes or
more to integrate into the network and start moving packets.  So
double-nought spies and their ilk can get that much mileage out of TOR.
So far I have not come up with a way to prevent what I call a Hydra
attack against /any/ distributed anonymizing overlay network:  An
adversary who owns and operates a majority of the relay nodes via
geographically dispersed proxies run from a single cloud server
literally "can't be beat" except by physically concealing one's identity
from the physical Internet router used.
Users who expect mere software to defeat network surveillance by top
tier actors have started out with false assumptions and end up taking
far greater risks than they would consider acceptable if they knew about
them.  The reluctance of intelligence services to reveal their
capabilities by acting on what they know too often provides the best
protection most users can get...

I don't recall the statistics but I would guess that torrents account
for at least 95% of the traffic on that network.  Maybe more like
99-point-something percent.
A website on the i2p network (eepsite) can host any files the user puts
in the site's /docroot directory.  That would include subdirectories
with their own index pages, not publicly advertised and available only
to "confidential" correspondents who know the names of the subdirectory
and index pages in question.  That's not quite a "digital dead drop" but
comes close.
I used to run a moderately popular eepsite and seeded lotsa torrents.
"Who" I was and what I may have distributed aside from publicly
advertised content is for me to know and others to guess.  Let's just
say I did it as an exercise and for amusement purposes only.  Last time
I checked, some of the stuff I seeded out was still bouncing around in
there years later.  :o)
The Tor Project's position on torrent traffic never made sense to me.
More users and more traffic add up to more security.  If casual users
see a bit more lag, so what?  In every instance where security vs. end
user arises convenience arises, TOR chooses convenience.
I was also very disappointed when the TOR Browser distribution dropped
support for router configuration; now they have done away with the last
scrap of that. "The Tor circuit display has been relocated and improved!
Click the Site Identity button (located on the left side of the URL bar)
to see the new circuit display" is a lie; there's no such button in the
update I just installed (ver 8.03), which presents the quoted text on
its 'update completed' page, but nothing related in any menu accessible
to the user.
The browser's configuration menu does present "new identity" and "new
circuit for this site" buttons; that's all, folks!  The "Donate Now"
link on the TOR welcome page does work though.
I would say it worked exactly as expected for Ulbricht and a few others
like him:  Always expect a faulty cost/benefit estimate produces net
loss results.

Trump is not fit to shine Hitler's boots.
Hitler was a combat wounded veteran who lived in poverty and worked
tirelessly to develop and promote his political vision; he took big
risks and spent time in jail in the process. Hitler was a fanatical
extremist, virulently xenophobic, and once his physician started giving
him cocaine and amphetamine in his vitamin shots he became full blown
paranoid psychotic.
Compare Trump: A poor little rich kid, ass deep in old school organized
crime, he has managed to piss away 2/3 of his inheritance just proving
himself to the public as a Big Success Story. Hitler was many ugly,
dangerous things, but never an ignorant, narcissistic buffoon fronting
for a radical faction of oligarchs intent on looting the remains of his
country's national economy.
A list of common features of fascism, from historian John Hawkins:
1. Totalitarian
2. Extreme nationalism
3. Top down revolution or movement
4. Destructive divisionism such as racism and class warfare
5. Extreme anti-communism, anti socialism and anti-liberal views
6. Extreme exploitation
7. Opportunistic ideology lacking in consistency as a means to grab power
8. Unbridled Corporatism
9. Reactionary
10. The use of violence and terror to attain and maintain power
11. Cult-like figurehead
12. The expounding of mysticism or religious beliefs
Our Mr. Trump, his administration and its backers don't fire on all of
the above cylinders, but I see close correlations in Trump
administration rhetoric, policy and performance on items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
8, 9 and 11.  Eight out of twelve ain't a bad start.  On item 12, Trump
himself does not pose as Christian but a majority of his loyal followers
do.  Items 1 and 10 would apply, but the inertia of U.S. political
institutions greatly slows the Trump crew's progress on establishing a
Totalitarian State controlled by State terrorism - further progress on
those fronts will require a large scale economic collapse, which we
might call a work in progress.
"Nazi" derives from NSDAP, itself an acronym for words that translate as
Nationalist Socialist Democratic Worker's Party.
Why "socialist"?  Because at the time the Party's name was coined,
Socialism was very popular in Germany - the German people didn't have
it, but they wanted it.  What they got was iron rule by a consortium of
industrialists, bankers and political ideologues, who rose to power with
the support of "ultra conservative" U.S. industrial, financial and
military power brokers including even the Dulles Brothers.  Union
busting, and literally rounding up and slaughtering Communists and
Socialists do not sound much like the actions of a Left Wing government
to me.
Antifa stands against efforts to organize and grow a U.S. populist
movement devoted to White Supremacy under iron Corporate rule.  Again,
compare the organizations under the Unite The Right banner with the list
of common features of fascism presented above:  They score higher than
the Trump Administration itself, because they do not have to adapt to
the constraints of attacking an established government from within its
own structure.
Comparing today's U.S. Antifa activists to the list of common features
of fascism above, I see correlations with items... um, item 9 only.  By
definition, any social or political movement that names and defines
itself as anti-something qualifies as "reactionary."
Our Reublican and Democratic Parties, and their financial sponsors,
share a uniform commitment to continued exponential growth of heavy
industry, as well as the ongoing transfer money and power from whole
populations to the hands of their financial and industrial masters.

Meh.  Sounds like a conventional offsite backup strategy to me.  It does
seem to indicate high confidence in the cryptographic tools used to
prevent stored data from being read by hostiles, with unusually strong
forward security (resistance to cryptanalysis for, say, 50+ years).
This contract would also indicate high confidence in methods used to
prevent useful source attribution and traffic analysis of files being

 A minor flaw in the plan... presenting no indicators of who actually
did the thing, other than that Saudi intel and their American friends
were well positioned to do the identity theft thing against Saudi

@_subject: After Mysterious Closure, Solar Observatory In New Mexico Reopens 
[ schnipp ]
My venture into Conspiracy Theory re this event, from another forum:
NSO has a couple of unique instruments:
"The NSO Integrated Synoptic Program (NISP) provides long-term synoptic
observations of the Sun’s photosphere, chromosphere, and magnetic field.
NISP operates a suite of instruments from the Global Oscillation Network
Group (GONG) which is located at six sites around the world, resulting
in 24/7 observations of the Sun. NISP also operates the Synoptic Optical
Long-term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) program, which is located at
Big Bear Observatory in California.
"The National Science Foundation‘s Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope
(DKIST) which is being built and operated by NSO, will be a 4-m off-axis
solar telescope with a suite of cutting-edge first light instruments.
Focused on better understanding the behaviors of the solar magnetic
field, from the photosphere to the corona, DKIST will revolutionize our
understanding of the Sun and it’s dynamic behavior. Using a technique
called spectropolarimetery, pioneered by the NSO and the world’s leading
solar scientists, we will indirectly measure magnetic fields in the
corona for the first time.
Some of these instruments may have been "of interest" to the military
reconnaissance and/or signals intelligence community.
Also note the closure of the nearest Post Office. Was a package sent by
or received at NSO that could cause this much ruckus? Depends what it
might have been: A chemical or biological weapon could produce the
response seen, but why mail it to or from NSO?  I rule out chemical or
biological payload for two reasons: First, why target the Observatory?
Second, early press reports did not describe use of protective clothing
by the Feds seen on site, or the presence of any medical or Public
Health teams.
What else could someone have mailed out that would bring a Federal
Shroud of Secrecy and Cone of Silence down on NRO?
My guess: A "spectropolarimetery" or other unique sensor and/or its
complete engineering docs might have gone missing. If the Feds asked the
Geeks what it does, then relayed their answer to NRO for an opinion, the
sensor might have got retroactively classified Top Secret due to its
potential ability to unmask some U.S. stealth technology, or other
wierdshit liek that.
I think that accounts for all observations to date, better than anything
I have seen so far. If the above scenario did happen, it's a
clusterfuck: Any such sensor would leave a massive paper trail through
the Solar Astronomy and Astronomical Metrics worlds, no hope in hell of
scooping up enough of that data to prevent "hostiles" from
reconstructing the sensor from open source clues.

The above sounds like a comparison between The Facebook (makes a token
effort to tie accounts to users' True Names), and 4chan (makes a token
effort to disconnect users from their True Names).  That strikes me as a
forced context creating forced either/or alternatives.  We need a middle
ground between True Names Only and Anonymous FTW.  We already have a
working example of that middle ground:  The i2p network.
i2p users host various resources including websites, torrent trackers,
and community forums on their own hardware, and access the resources
etc. of their choice either anonymously, or pseudonymously via
user-chosen screen names.  i2p users may disclose their True Names at
will, but by default the identity and location of i2p users can not be
determined without State level infrastructure access and surveillance
resources.  An i2p user's actual True Name is his or her i2p router ID,
which by design has no connection with any geographic location or birth
Result?  A more intelligent, better behaved version of the Internet,
with prevailing attitudes reminiscent of the public Internet shortly
before AOL popped up and saturation bombed us with weaponized morons,
followed by MegaCorporations looking to manipulate, control and extract
capital from the said morons.  (Younger folks:  Look up "Eternal
September" for the sad true story.)
I can not completely attribute the modest i2p success story to the
prevalence of users known by pseudonyms only.  To access i2p one has to
install and configure software that will not work unless one cam read
and apply howto docs and such; this screens out the less-bright 80% of
potential users right up front.  Size also matters:  The smaller the
network, the more good or bad behavior stands out, and the larger the
benefits of presenting as a good (in the sense of useful) person.  At
present, i2p has about 60k users according to stats.i2p.
But I do not discount the prevalence of stable pseudo-identities as the
primary factor affecting the quality of content and discourse in i2p
space; without this factor, concerns for reputation would have no
impact.  Compared to the great unwashed publick visible on the open
Internet under their own names, i2p participants seem remarkably polite,
intelligent and responsible.  Go figure.
A user's i2p persona can take any form, and may include the content of
websites that live on their creators' own hardware, accessible only via
the i2p router network.  It takes about a day for anyone who knows HTML
to build a website in i2p space; just turn on the server included in the
router package and populate the relevant local directories with content.
Pseudonyms that become visible in i2p space through participation over
time become "persons" in a community, defined by their in-network
behavior, building relationships and reputations based on their
contributions.  The folks who wear those masks mostly take good care of
them, because the trust and cooperation of other users in the community
has value:  When a well respected i2p user asks for something, other
users who have benefited from that user's contributions, advice, example
etc. make a real effort to come through, because that's what humans do.
Smart ones, anyway.

The inherent logical disconnect between anarchy and law enforcement
underlines the irrelevance of /most/ debate about how an anarchist

I prefer what used to be called frontier justice:  When someone makes
enough trouble to motivate enough people to do something about it, they
act:  Maybe a good talking-to; if that fails to curb the behavior in
question, maybe running the offender out of town; if that seems
inadequate to protect the community, maybe killing the bastard.

Nobody 'tall.  But any society /will/ act to protect itself against
people who exhibit chronic violent behavior - with exceptions where
civilized societies reward that behavior so long as it serves the
purposes of the worst offenders, its ruling class.
Anarchy simply means the absence of a social command hierarchy acting
through coercive means.  Anarchism denotes theoretical consideration and
rhetoric related to defining and implementing (relatively) nonviolent
social conventions and behavior.
The word "justice" indicates "adjustment."
Lao Tzu say:  "A man most conversant in the rites acts, but when no one
responds, rolls up his sleeves and resorts to persuasion by force."
The most typical problems with any idealistic -ism arise when people
take abstract ideas literally and try to apply them without
consideration of material context in the real world.  As guiding
principles, abstractions like "anarchy" can deliver a lot of value; but
as explicit instructions held to apply universally, they often achieve
the exact opposite of their intended results.

Spotlights and laughter should cut a guy like this Berwick down to size,

such a response more practicable.
Of course.  I did say "civilization."
"Consensual" presents as a subset of "nonviolent."

She measures, cuts and adjusts until the pans come out level.  Witness
the civilizing influence of the law at work.
I would much rather see a simple attitude adjustment tried way before
some strange woman breaks out the pointy hardware.
To clarify what I meant to say:  People who imagine themselves
absolutely right and act on that basis can turn anything into a moral
excuse for tyranny.  Even anarchism.
Tons of pop culture, corporate media references, and political
literature present anarchism a sort of violent nihilism.  To one or
another extent, the century-plus long full spectrum saturation Big Lie
propaganda campaign against anarchism and anarchists affects everyone,
including self identifying anarchists.
To see working models of Frontier Justice in action, try participating
in independent groups that do organized events and actions, and watch
for this:  A petty tyrant who calls himself an anarchist shows up (it's
nearly always a guy) and must have his way - regardless of whether his
way cuts right across the grain of consensus activities already in
progress, alienate useful constituencies and alliances that took time
and effort to build, and/or etc.  He must have his way, and from his
ultimate moral high ground he can win any argument about that, one way
or another.
Go to enough meetings and events and one of those will eventually turn
up.  Check out how the more experienced anarchists - if any - manage his
case:  If they know their business they will salvage him - if possible.
 That starts with 'active listening' and probing for common ground, and
often ends with a valuable new community member.  If instead he gets
firmly invited to leave, that would most likely indicate a history of
violence against other participants - but don't assume, find out.

I got a Facebook account for maybe seven or eight years ago.  Since then
I have used it to find and hook up with local activist orgs; get
feedback on propaganda materials (handbills, flyers, etc.) in production
and distribute the finished products to people who used them IRL; do
volunteer intelligence work for activist orgs; picked up a few paying

No question:  The Facebook presents as a 'computer dating service' of
sorts, profiling users' interests and personalities and pulling users
into echo chambers populated by "their own kind."  To a lesser extent
The Facebook also exposes users to "opposite" personalities and
messages, to encourage conflict and polarization - because that drives
user engagement and, in the long run, promotes our rulers' "divide the
conquered" agenda.
The Facebook primarily works to find users' existing biases and magnify
them; their business model includes "changing minds" with regard to
consumer purchasing preferences and frequency.  In the sphere of
political ideology, The Facebook spots, classifies and reinforces the
users' already established patterns, enhancing their predictable
responses to targeted political propaganda.
Yup.  However, those echo chambers do have their potential uses:  One
must always preach to the choir, else how will they get on the same page
and work together effectively at show time?
As an example, The Facebook has enabled me to distribute hundreds of
copies of this package of documents to receptive readers:
I think that alone makes screwing around with The Facebook a net win.
Javascript?  Optional.  Replace the www in any Facebook address with m,
for the legacy mobile version.  I learned this exists when searching for
a convenient way to download videos posted directly on The Facebook - in
the mobile version, just right-click and save-as.  Since then, mobile
has become my default mode.
The "fancy" version of The Facebook requires JS from facebook.com and
fbcdn.com ["facebook content distribution network"].  Block Javascript
from all other sites while on the facebook.com domain and the thing
works faster and better, without 3rd party user tracking.  NoScript does
the deed quite conveniently.  AdBlock plasters over some of the cracks
that may be left.
Another tracking feature:  Links to posted URLs displayed in The
Facebook do not point to the targets advertised, but to The Facebook
itself, with PHP arguments appended; when clicked on, these links result
in a fast redirect to the target site, with a Facebook tracking code
appended, again as a PHP string.  As far as I know, nobody has made a
browser plugin to automagically sanitize this process; but the real link
does appear in the on-page Facebook link; users can extract the real
link, to kill that component of Facebook user tracking.
The Facebook's pages load a keylogger?  I would like to hear more about
that; so far I have seen no evidence of one.
That strikes me as a case of "making the perfect the enemy of the good."
 All the better State sponsored dissident groups do that, both to assert
their acolytes' moral superiority and to discourage anyone from doing
anything that might have unwanted real world political impacts.  As I
said before, "It's a piss poor pitiful anarchist who's too stinkin' good
to use the State's resources against the interests of the State."
I would stack up the long term social and political impact of the dozen
or so minds The Facebook may have helped me ruin forever up against any
12,000 or so Normal People made more Normal by The Facebook itself, and
call it a net win.  The Facebook enables talent spotters to establish
one on one comms channels on demand, a resource that presents as an
exploitable weakness in the opposition's infrastructure.  Anything you
say can and will be used against you in political warfare, but knowing

produce greatly amplified effects later.

m.facebook.com would exist to support for legacy systems and software,
and incidentally provide accessibility for visually impaired users.  I
don't expect it to go away any time soon.
I just loaded up The Facebook and switched off all filters.  On The

That would be Javascript all right:  A tangled mess that sometimes slows
the browser down to a crawl.  I only /rarely/ shift out of "mobile"
mode.  But a keylogger "logs" keystrokes.  The speed at which The
Facebook populates autocompleted "suggestions" seems to indicate a
script that compares strings after the last space to a preloaded list on
the client side, not traffic to and from The Facebook itself.  And
presumably, one would intend to transmit anything typed in a Facebook
web interface to The Facebook anyway...
Here's a fun thing though:  The Facebook steals e-mail addresses in
transit.  One of mine was sold to spammers within minutes, from a PDF
file sent via "personal" message.  That was my mistake.
They also steal the passwords that go with user e-mail addresses, when
they can, through social engineering:
When I signed up for a Facebook account a few years ago, they pestered
me daily for months:  Asking for the password to the e-mail account I
gave them as my contact address.  Their electronic begging letter said
they would use it harvest the e-mail account's address book, so they
could spam everyone in it with invitations to contact me on Facebook.
Naturally, I laughed at that and kept the password out of their busy
little hands.  Eventually they gave up.
Turns out a LOT of people must have laughed at that, because later The
Facebook started asking for new users' e-mail passwords as part of
"confirming" any new account that someone was setting up.  Then, in what
sounds like an act of mockery, they displayed the users' contact lists
to them was they were harvested.  You can't make this shit up --- or at
least, I didn't:
Do you think they may have used all those passwords for other things
too, such as data mining the contents of those e-mail accounts for
market research purposes, the better to target their advertising?
Taking advantage of helpless people (such asking for AND GETTING
someone's e-mail account password) presents a typical example of what
The Facebook does:  A vendor of amusement and communications to
the public, and of the public's supposedly private data to all comers
who can afford their rates.

I would refer readers to an earlier comment I made about anarchists who
refuse to use the State's resources against the State's interests...
Have you looked at geophysics and material economics much lately?
The material resources necessary to sustain post-industrial civilization
have stretched thinner every year since the 1980s and the utilization
costs (in energy) of what remains has risen fast - the cheap, easy to
get stuff already got used.  Potable water, phosphates, topsoil,
petrochemical fuels, copper...  We do have an abundant and rising supply
of demand, as exponential population growth continues.
Global warming continues at a brisk pace.  Drivers include annual
methane emissions from former northern hemisphere permafrost bogs, and
massive, newly discovered and Arctic sea floor blowout craters with more
on the way.  Methane traps heat WAY better than carbon dioxide, and we
have unlocked the storehouse.
Warming oceans hold less dissolved oxygen, and anaerobic bacteria have
started reclaiming old territory already, poisoning it with hydrogen
sulphide.  "Alarmist" global warming projections do not yet include the
impact of the constant and accelerating rise of atmospheric methane.
Take a peek at the Permian Extinction...
I do not recall ever suggesting that I might be "helping the enemy."  As
a rule I don't have enemies; that kind of thinking leads to irrational
behavior and cumulative strategic losses.  Example:  Asserting that I
naively assume I can beat the State at its own game.  That looks like
Name Calling and a Strawman attack in one sentence.
I do have some skill in semantic games; you may notice that my posts in
this thread do not make use of the words is, are, was, were, am, be,

"Then we succeeded that he would be allowed to have a kitten, whose

generated one of the most odd and obtuse amongst the complaints raised
by the current president of Ecuador."
In my opinion, the whole current mess is not fair to James.  Does anyone
know who's looking after him now?
Meanwhile, here's a rare find:  Sensible commentary on the state of play
on the legal front:
For the new kids:  The theory behind the practice of Wikileaks in a
brief and seemingly unfinished essay from Himself, courtesy of JYA:
Wikileaks was originally presented as a community project, a "Wikipedia
of" leaked documents, vetted and analyzed by a distributed network of
volunteers.  But when the Manning files showed up, Assange hijacked the
project and put it on lockdown, presumably due to security concerns when
presented with what may stand as The Leak Of The Century.
Our Mendax pissed a lot of people off, yrs. truly included - but when
Collateral Murder, War Diaries and Cablegate hit the nables, I forgave
all.  He surely knows the definition of "humility" but to him it must
forever remain an abstract concept.  Considering his impact on public

I just got my first three day suspension from The Facebook, for
"Bullying and Harassment."  We all know how the internet interprets
censorship and what it does; here's the offending text:
The offending text contains none of the following:  Hate speech,
disparagement of any person or product, incitement to violence,
solicitation of crime, commercial content, personal attacks of any kind,
violent or sexual language of any kind.  It was on-topic in the reply
thread where I posted it.
My thoughtcrime?  I questioned the accuracy of the New Zeland Mosque

very briefly speculated on the propaganda intent of the video,

The above sounds like a comparison between The Facebook (makes a token
effort to tie accounts to users' True Names), and 4chan (makes a token
effort to disconnect users from their True Names).  That strikes me as a
forced context creating forced either/or alternatives.  We need a middle
ground between True Names Only and Anonymous FTW.  We already have a
working example of that middle ground:  The i2p network.
i2p users host various resources including websites, torrent trackers,
and community forums on their own hardware, and access the resources
etc. of their choice either anonymously, or pseudonymously via
user-chosen screen names.  i2p users may disclose their True Names at
will, but by default the identity and location of i2p users can not be
determined without State level infrastructure access and surveillance
resources.  An i2p user's actual True Name is his or her i2p router ID,
which by design has no connection with any geographic location or birth
Result?  A more intelligent, better behaved version of the Internet,
with prevailing attitudes reminiscent of the public Internet shortly
before AOL popped up and saturation bombed us with weaponized morons,
followed by MegaCorporations looking to manipulate, control and extract
capital from the said morons.  (Younger folks:  Look up "Eternal
September" for the sad true story.)
I can not completely attribute the modest i2p success story to the
prevalence of users known by pseudonyms only.  To access i2p one has to
install and configure software that will not work unless one cam read
and apply howto docs and such; this screens out the less-bright 80% of
potential users right up front.  Size also matters:  The smaller the
network, the more good or bad behavior stands out, and the larger the
benefits of presenting as a good (in the sense of useful) person.  At
present, i2p has about 60k users according to stats.i2p.
But I do not discount the prevalence of stable pseudo-identities as the
primary factor affecting the quality of content and discourse in i2p
space; without this factor, concerns for reputation would have no
impact.  Compared to the great unwashed publick visible on the open
Internet under their own names, i2p participants seem remarkably polite,
intelligent and responsible.  Go figure.
A user's i2p persona can take any form, and may include the content of
websites that live on their creators' own hardware, accessible only via
the i2p router network.  It takes about a day for anyone who knows HTML
to build a website in i2p space; just turn on the server included in the
router package and populate the relevant local directories with content.
Pseudonyms that become visible in i2p space through participation over
time become "persons" in a community, defined by their in-network
behavior, building relationships and reputations based on their
contributions.  The folks who wear those masks mostly take good care of
them, because the trust and cooperation of other users in the community
has value:  When a well respected i2p user asks for something, other
users who have benefited from that user's contributions, advice, example
etc. make a real effort to come through, because that's what humans do.
Smart ones, anyway.
Postscript:  Above I mentioned True Names, from the Vernor Vinge novella
of that name.  Published in 1981, True Names introduced the term
'cyberspace' and several key concepts relevant to Cypherpunk interests.

The inherent logical disconnect between anarchy and law enforcement
underlines the irrelevance of /most/ debate about how an anarchist
society should be run.
I prefer what used to be called frontier justice:  When someone makes
enough trouble to motivate enough people to do something about it, they
act:  Maybe a good talking-to; if that fails to curb the behavior in
question, maybe running the offender out of town; if that seems
inadequate to protect the community, maybe killing the bastard.
Frontier justice is not perfect, but it's the best system we have.

tort claims, on a level playing field where wealth, power, and political
prejudice provide no advantages, can exist.

Nobody 'tall.  But any society /will/ act to protect itself against
people who exhibit chronic violent behavior - with exceptions where
civilized societies reward that behavior so long as it serves the
purposes of the worst offenders, its ruling class.
Anarchy simply means the absence of a social command hierarchy acting
through coercive means.  Anarchism denotes theoretical consideration and
rhetoric related to defining and implementing (relatively) nonviolent
social conventions and behavior.
The word "justice" indicates "adjustment."
Lao Tzu say:  "A man most conversant in the rites acts, but when no one
responds, rolls up his sleeves and resorts to persuasion by force."
The most typical problems with any idealistic -ism arise when people
take abstract ideas literally and try to apply them without
consideration of material context in the real world.  As guiding
principles, abstractions like "anarchy" can deliver a lot of value; but
as explicit instructions held to apply universally, they often achieve
the exact opposite of their intended results.

Spotlights and laughter should cut a guy like this Berwick down to size,
where/as required.  The beauty part:  If a more creative response

such a response more practicable.
Of course.  I did say "civilization."
"Consensual" presents as a subset of "nonviolent."
She weighs events in the balance, blindfolded, while holding a sword.
She measures, cuts and adjusts until the pans come out level.  Witness
the civilizing influence of the law at work.
I would much rather see a simple attitude adjustment tried way before
some strange woman breaks out the pointy hardware.
To clarify what I meant to say:  People who imagine themselves
absolutely right and act on that basis can turn anything into a moral
excuse for tyranny.  Even anarchism.
Tons of pop culture, corporate media references, and political
literature present anarchism a sort of violent nihilism.  To one or
another extent, the century-plus long full spectrum saturation Big Lie
propaganda campaign against anarchism and anarchists affects everyone,
including self identifying anarchists.
To see working models of Frontier Justice in action, try participating
in independent groups that do organized events and actions, and watch
for this:  A petty tyrant who calls himself an anarchist shows up (it's
nearly always a guy) and must have his way - regardless of whether his
way cuts right across the grain of consensus activities already in
progress, alienate useful constituencies and alliances that took time
and effort to build, and/or etc.  He must have his way, and from his
ultimate moral high ground he can win any argument about that, one way
or another.
Go to enough meetings and events and one of those will eventually turn
up.  Check out how the more experienced anarchists - if any - manage his
case:  If they know their business they will salvage him - if possible.
 That starts with 'active listening' and probing for common ground, and
often ends with a valuable new community member.  If instead he gets
firmly invited to leave, that would most likely indicate a history of
violence against other participants - but don't assume, find out.

Don't y'all hate on me 'cause I have an account at The Facebook.  I set

Once it was there, I started using the Facebook account to pump out

got yanked into the scene and 'made use of.'  My kind of fun!
I encourage CPunks readers who also maintain accounts at The Facebook -
no need to confess that sin here - to share the above link.  Since it's
hosted on my website vs. presenting as your very own thoughtcrime, this

script that compares strings after the last space to a preloaded list on
the client side, not traffic to and from The Facebook itself.  And
presumably, one would intend to transmit anything typed in a Facebook
web interface to The Facebook anyway...
Here's a fun thing though:  The Facebook steals e-mail addresses in
transit.  One of mine was sold to spammers within minutes, from a PDF
file sent via "personal" message.  That was my mistake.
They also steal the passwords that go with user e-mail addresses, when
they can, through social engineering:
When I signed up for a Facebook account a few years ago, they pestered
me daily for months:  Asking for the password to the e-mail account I
gave them as my contact address.  Their electronic begging letter said
they would use it harvest the e-mail account's address book, so they
could spam everyone in it with invitations to contact me on Facebook.
Naturally, I laughed at that and kept the password out of their busy
little hands.  Eventually they gave up.
Turns out a LOT of people must have laughed at that, because later The
Facebook started asking for new users' e-mail passwords as part of
"confirming" any new account that someone was setting up.  Then, in what
sounds like an act of mockery, they displayed the users' contact lists
to them was they were harvested.  You can't make this shit up --- or at
least, I didn't:
Do you think they may have used all those passwords for other things
too, such as data mining the contents of those e-mail accounts for
market research purposes, the better to target their advertising?
Taking advantage of helpless people (such asking for AND GETTING
someone's e-mail account password) presents a typical example of what
The Facebook does:  A vendor of amusement and communications to
the public, and of the public's supposedly private data to all comers
who can afford their rates.
Also, a subsidiary of the U.S. Intelligence Community:
I would refer readers to an earlier comment I made about anarchists who
refuse to use the State's resources against the State's interests...
Have you looked at geophysics and material economics much lately?
The material resources necessary to sustain post-industrial civilization
have stretched thinner every year since the 1980s and the utilization
costs (in energy) of what remains has risen fast - the cheap, easy to
get stuff already got used.  Potable water, phosphates, topsoil,
petrochemical fuels, copper...  We do have an abundant and rising supply
of demand, as exponential population growth continues.
Global warming continues at a brisk pace.  Drivers include annual
methane emissions from former northern hemisphere permafrost bogs, and
massive, newly discovered and Arctic sea floor blowout craters with more
on the way.  Methane traps heat WAY better than carbon dioxide, and we
have unlocked the storehouse.
Warming oceans hold less dissolved oxygen, and anaerobic bacteria have
started reclaiming old territory already, poisoning it with hydrogen
sulphide.  "Alarmist" global warming projections do not yet include the
impact of the constant and accelerating rise of atmospheric methane.
Take a peek at the Permian Extinction...
I do not recall ever suggesting that I might be "helping the enemy."  As
a rule I don't have enemies; that kind of thinking leads to irrational
behavior and cumulative strategic losses.  Example:  Asserting that I
naively assume I can beat the State at its own game.  That looks like
Name Calling and a Strawman attack in one sentence.
I do have some skill in semantic games; you may notice that my posts in
this thread do not make use of the words is, are, was, were, am, be,
been, or variations on / contractions for same.  Called E-Prime, this
technique makes clear communication easier, and losing arguments harder.

Our comrade Mendax has a way with the ladies, including accomplished
professionals like Argentine Ambassador to the UK (2006-2011) Alicia Castro:
"Then we succeeded that he would be allowed to have a kitten, whose
company he greatly enjoyed, and whose presence at the embassy has
generated one of the most odd and obtuse amongst the complaints raised
by the current president of Ecuador."
In my opinion, the whole current mess is not fair to James.  Does anyone
know who's looking after him now?
Meanwhile, here's a rare find:  Sensible commentary on the state of play

For the new kids:  The theory behind the practice of Wikileaks in a
brief and seemingly unfinished essay from Himself, courtesy of JYA:
Wikileaks was originally presented as a community project, a "Wikipedia
of" leaked documents, vetted and analyzed by a distributed network of
volunteers.  But when the Manning files showed up, Assange hijacked the
project and put it on lockdown, presumably due to security concerns when
presented with what may stand as The Leak Of The Century.
Our Mendax pissed a lot of people off, yrs. truly included - but when
Collateral Murder, War Diaries and Cablegate hit the nables, I forgave

forever remain an abstract concept.  Considering his impact on public

My small contribution comes in at only 1400 words:
The Prisoner: An Introduction
The Prisoner is one of the most iconic and surrealistic, if not
psychedelic, products of the 1960s "golden age" of television.  An angry
secret agent returns home from hand delivering his letter of
resignation, when he is immediately gassed by an undertaker in top hat
and tails.  He regains consciousness in his own bed but when he looks
out his window he discovers that he is no longer home at all:  He is in
The Village, a deceptively idyllic holiday resort that is actually a
high tech prison for spies.  At once the games begin.
In The Village, people are known by numbers, not names.  Our abducted
protagonist is Number 6.  The commander in chief of The Village is
Number 2 - a post occupied by a series of individuals, most of whom have
one principal job:  To psychologically break Number 6, in order learn
all he knows beginning with why he resigned - and, if possible, to
recruit him into whatever service operates The Village.  Who, or in Cold
War parlance "which side," runs The Village?  What makes Number 6 so
important to them?  Among the residents of The Village, "Who are the
prisoners, and who the warders?"  Direct or final answers are rarely found.
Since its release in 1967/68 the Prisoner has been addressed in
documentaries, books and a large volume of fan literature, examining
every aspect of the series in detail.  International fan clubs are still
active today:  Six Of One ("The Prisoner Appreciation Society") hosts an
annual convention at Portmeirion, the Welsh resort where the series was
filmed.  Why do these 17 hours of enigmatic television have such durable
appeal?  Where does The Prisoner hook into our gut instincts and
cultural zeitgeist?
The Prisoner is a product of its times:  During the Cold War spies,
conspiracies and covert operations were among the principal weapons of
East and West.  Along with the deployment of large clandestine services
by the Superpowers, Western popular culture was inundated with spy
propaganda in the form of books, movies and TV shows glamorizing spies
as real-life superheroes.  Ian Fleming, a former OSS officer who worked
with the founders of MI-5 and the CIA, led the charge with his best
selling James Bond novels.  In short order spy fiction became a hugely
popular and profitable genre in television and motion pictures.
Prior to this media barrage, espionage was generally considered a
disreputable trade - a dishonest, dishonorable and even cowardly
approach to warfare.  The spy fiction of the Cold War era turned the
public image of the clandestine services all the way around - no expense
was spared in presenting espionage as a daring, heroic and altogether
admirable business, and the public responded enthusiastically.  This
glamorous image lasted into the 1970s, when public disclosure of
programs like COINTELPRO, the Phoenix Program and first hand accounts of
CIA field work by Phil Agee and others shattered the illusion.
The Prisoner has a lesser known back story:  In 1960, British TV
producer Ralph Smart created a spy series, Danger Man, starring Patrick
McGoohan as John Drake.  In each half hour episode Drake, a spy of
deliberately ambiguous nationality working for NATO, was dispatched on a
new international assignment.  Drake's doings were much more realistic
than Bond's - his assignments included counter-espionage, political
interventions in post-colonial nations, and some missions bordering on
international law enforcement.  He battled no super-villains, seduced no
glamorous women, and always preferred strategic deception to
ultra-violence:  "I never carry a gun.  They're noisy and they hurt
people.  Besides, I do very well without."
Only one season of the Danger Man series was produced for the British
domestic market.  The show did well in the UK and became very popular in
the U.S. where it was titled Secret Agent, with Johnny Rivers singing
the title theme Secret Agent Man,  on the U.S. pop charts.  McGoohan
became a hot media property:  In 1962, he turned down an offer from Eon
Productions to star in Dr. No, the first James Bond film; this was Sean
Connery's big break.
After a two year hiatus, two more seasons of Danger Man were produced
for international distribution.  The revived series clearly identified
Drake as a British intelligence officer working for M6, a fictional
British agency.  Its one hour format allowed more complex stories and
some development of the Drake character, including elements of moral
ambiguity and substantial friction and resentment between Drake and his
employers.  Critics and the public loved it.  A 4th series was abandoned
after only two episodes were produced, for reasons that remain unclear.
 McGoohan and Danger Man script editor George Markstein already had a
new project in mind: The Prisoner.
To avoid licensing issues - and promote the mystique of the new series -
McGoohan and the production staff for The Prisoner always pointedly
denied that Number 6 was John Drake.  But if our Number 6 was anyone
else, Drake must have had a twin with identical attitudes, personality
and occupational experience.  Why did Drake resign from M6, and why was
this question the constant theme of attempts by his captors to break him
down?  If I told you I would have to kill you.  We are advised that
"questions are a burden to others, answers a prison for oneself."
Many viewers were disappointed by The Prisoner's two-part series
conclusion, Once Upon A Time and Fall Out:  Even compared to the other
Prisoner episodes they are rather bizarre.  Those who know what the word
"allegory" means won't be disappointed, if they are in a mood for a
story told in a series of events that point toward psychological,
political and perhaps even autobiographical paths to the solution of
Drake's enigma.  At the end of the final episode, the closing credits
show that Number 6 was played by "The Prisoner" rather than Patrick
McGoohan.  I have my own suspicions about this final touch of quirky
humor, but "a still tongue makes a happy life."
Both The Prisoner and Danger Man are available as commercial DVD sets
and, of course, via covert channels on the usual networks.
Be seeing you!
A note from your Citizen's Advice Bureau:
Unsolved mysteries in The Prisoner include the correct sequence of the
episodes:  They were produced out of order for logistical reasons, and
delays in production interrupted the series' original broadcast run.
The first episode and the final two are obviously in their right places,
but the rest?  Detailed analysis of the content of the episodes
themselves provides some clues, and this order from a project published
by Six Of One is very satisfactory:
01 - Arrival
02 - Dance Of The Dead
03 - Free For All
04 - The Chimes Of Big Ben
05 - Checkmate
06 - The General
07 - A B & C
08 - The Schizoid Man
09 - Many Happy Returns
10 - Living In Harmony
11 - A Change Of Mind
12 - Hammer Into Anvil
13 - Do Not Forsake Me Oh My Darling
14 - It's Your Funeral
15 - The Girl Who Was Death
16 - Once Upon A Time
17 - Fallout - Series Finale
Prior acquaintance with John Drake enables us to view The Prisoner in
its native context.  These episodes of Danger Man provide a well rounded
introduction to the fictional man behind the famous number:
Episode 52 - That's Two Of Us Sorry:  Drake investigates a theft of
nuclear research secrets that leads him into morally hazardous human
Episode 54 - Whatever Happened to George Foster:  Drake catches a
respected NGO doing dirty politics in Latin America, leading to a
personal war against Establishment adversaries at home.
Episode 57 - The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove:  Foreshadowing the surrealism
of The Prisoner, Drake battles a hostile spy ring's recruitment front
while slightly out of his mind.
Episode 58 - It's Up To The Lady:  A realistic spy story about
retrieving a defector by using his wife for leverage, with a
too-realistic twist.
Episode 70 - The English Lady Takes Lodgers:  Sometimes a spy yarn is
only a spy yarn, and sometimes Drake's occupation permits him to play
the perfect knight.
Episode 74, To Our Best Friend:  McGoohan directs this episode which
pits Drake against his employers from beginning to end.
Episode 84 - The Not-So-Jolly Roger:  A conventional period spy story in
a most unconventional period setting:  Filmed on location at Pirate
Radio 390, Red Sands Fort.

@_subject: The cultural turn in intelligence studies 
During production of the Danger Man series, McGoohan demanded and got a
lot of creative control.  Drake's failure to adhere to prevailing
stereotypes was largely McGoohan's doing, as was the general trend
toward realism in Danger Man scripts, relative to other popular spy
McGoohan avoided personal publicity and his private life was anything
but an open book; but what he did say when he spoke as himself indicated
anarchist or at least libertarian leanings. As a consummate professional
McGoohan no doubt did his homework, learning as much as he could about
how real intelligence services do their business.  He obviously did not
like what he saw.
I view The Prisoner in part as a report on what MeGoohan learned about
the spy business and its role in society, and in part as anti-recruiting
propaganda targeting that industry.  My take-away from The Prisoner?
Cooperate with any intelligence service and:
1)  You will not know who your real employers are.
2)  You will not know your employers real intentions.
3)  Your contributions will always and only do harm.
4)  They will dispose of you when your usefulness to them ends.
The above may not apply so much to people from the "best families" who
serve managerial roles (back during WWII the initials 'OSS' were
sometimes said to stand for 'Oh So Social'), but rank and file
intelligence officers and agents (i.e. intelligence professionals and
witting or witless dupes under their direction) present as cheap,
expendable supply items.
Why did the closing credits of Fallout, the last Prisoner episode,
indicate that Number Six was played by The Prisoner?  Maybe just that
the series was a difficult and demanding project, and McGoohan felt like
celebrating getting it done and over with.

One ostensible 'disproof' of the moon landing was the claim that the video camera didn't show any stars in the moon's sky.  However, the scenery seen in those shots (lunar soil; equipment; astronauts) was extremely bright, somewhat like a beach in full sunlight.  The contrast ratios of (non-silicon) video pickup tubes in that era were not wide, meaning that any star in the sky (other than the sun) couldn't be visible AND show the backgrounds too.

Speaking of which, regional so-called Bureaus of Investigation and even

effectiveness of political activists and other annoyances.
Step one, two gents in conservative suits visit your employer, flash
impressive ID cards, and obtain consent for a "confidential" interview.
 Then they start asking questions:  How well to you know The Subject,
have you seen any indications of X, Y or Z?  They won't accuse you of
anything, but their leading questions say that you are involved in dope
dealing, terrorism, child trafficking, or whatever else they judge will
frighten and/or anger your employer the most.
Kiss that job goodbye.
Your next employer visits the State labor department website to complete
an unemployment compensation form, and on the same day their phone
rings:  Your SSN tripped a filter, and an e-mail arrived at your local
Fusion Center. A watch officer grabs the script indicated, picks up the
phone and asks for an appointment to interview your new employer, again
on a "confidential" basis.  Needless to say, the new hire intake process
ends there and then with weak or no excuses made.
How does a person get on an enemies list like the one described?  Well,
bluntly refusing to inform on your friends will do it - especially if
you "turn" the asset who made the recruiting pitch, and/or feed him or
her intelligence designed to waste as much of the opposition's money and
resources as possible.  For instance if you "have reason to believe"
that certain people hanging around local activist orgs are Federal
informants, persuading informants working for your Town Clowns that they
are high level drug dealers might provide some harmless amusement.

Funny thing:  All the feminists I have known had a primarily anarchist
orientation.  I guess it depends on who you run around with - and/or
whether one's information comes from personal contacts or mass media
propaganda sources.  If that seems "wrong" look up Emma Goldman, Lucy
Parsons and Simone De Beauvoir.
Feminazis seem to have originated in the New Left.  Presenting a
caricature of reactionary Marxism, the New Left rose to prominence in
the 1960s, displacing and discrediting Liberal and Pacifist voices in
U.S. media during the Vietnam War.  I suspect these folks had US State
sponsors:  The FBI's funding and direction of terrorist cells in the
U.S. at that time (per evidence in Court cases acquitting "dupes")
indicates vigorous political warfare against home grown U.S. dissidents.
 Failure to field a media personality propaganda front demonizing
dissidents would make no sense at all.
Following a make-over in the late 70s & early 80s, the New Left and its
new recruits call themselves Progressives.  Working as freelance
profiteers under the sponsorship of folks like Our Mrs. Clinton and her
network, our Progressives continue to use every means at their disposal
- now a respectable arsenal of propaganda assets, astroturf fronts,
friendly elected officials, etc. - to discredit and suppress grass roots
Liberal and Pacifist political activism, not to mention anti-Fascist
organizers and anything resembling anarchism.

@_subject: Dropgang vulnerabilities 
Here's some ideas about structural vulnerabilities in the Dropgang
protocol, as described at Dead drop reuse:
To achieve acceptable security each dead drop may be used once only,
because hostile buyers could place 'their' dead drops under video
surveillance  and record every courier and customer visit to the drop
following their own transaction.
Couriers delivering to dead drops can not determine if their supplier
sends them to previously used dead drops, unless they service only dead
drops they set up and document themselves.  Couriers should transmit the
locations of drops they have developed only when presented with an order
to fill, to assure that their distributor can not send other couriers
and customers to use them first.  The added surveillance exposure of
making two visits to the same site - setup and delivery - presents less
exposure than trusting that the anonymous seller will never send a
courier to a previously used dead drop.
Sales layer incentives for reusing dead drops include faster service
during episodes of high demand for their products, and reducing the
payment demands (time & labor = money) of their pool of delivery agents
by reducing the need to develop new dead drops.  Compared to single-use
dead drops, reusing dead drops would enable distributors to reduce the
cost of compensating agents to select and document new dead drops by up
to 1/n the number of delivery agents employed, without disclosing to any
delivery agent that the distributor does reuse dead drops.  Absent an
active and aggressive adversary, reusing dead drops would present few
risks, so distributors may "get away with it" long enough to establish,
in their own minds, that reuse is safe enough, and "either way I am not
personally at risk."
In the context of potential reuse of dead drops by unwitting delivery
agents, isolation of the Sales layer from the Distribution layer via
cryptography and mix networking tends to create potential hazards rather
than removing them:  Exposing delivery agents to drop-dead risks may
cost sales agents some employees but has no other immediate
repercussions as no evidence implicates them in exposing service agents
to hostile actors.  Over time a sales layer actor who burns delivery
agents may run into trouble secondary to "cooperating witnesses"
assisting investigators working their way up the chain of product
custody; faith in the security of the protocol could easily lead some
bad faith actors to dismiss that possibility.
I noted that the article linked above endorses reuse of dead drops as
acceptable, by saying that "An ideal dead drop is however used exactly
once. Only then can the risks of using it be reduced to pure bad luck."
 I would hesitate to make purchases via the Dropgang protocol, because
customers have no way of assuring that hostile buyers did not visit the
same dead drops first - and some Dropgang advocates do not seem to
understand the severity of the risks associated with dead drop reuse in
the Dropgang context.
Dead drop profiling:
I believe the ability of hostile actors to in effect purchase dead drop
locations, and delivery timing information, presents as an Achilles heel
of the Dropgang protocol even with single use dead drops:  Controlled
buys would enable State or other well funded actors to map and profile
dead drop sites, reducing scope of counter-Dropgang surveillance from
"everywhere people can go" to target areas.
The more random-ish and widely dispersed the dead drop sites, the higher
the overhead in developing and servicing new drop sites due to travel
time, orientation to unfamiliar terrain, etc.  In most instances dead
drops will concentrate in the most convenient terrain for delivery
agents and customers.
As geographic clusters of dead drops appear in data from controlled
buys, more effective surveillance of those areas would follow.  This
observation suggests a security advantage when fewer, higher value
transactions are handled, reducing the number of data points available
to hostile buyers, and justifying more travel and effort to service
drops.  Bulk purchasers may also tolerate longer latency between orders
and pickups than end use consumers.  Higher latency reduces exposure to
timing attacks and retroactive surveillance.
Timing attacks:
Controlled purchases in conjunction with surveillance of suspected
delivery agents (distribution layer) enable timing attacks, as buyers
would know that the agent who filled their orders did so between the
times the orders were placed and picked up.  Surveillance State
adversaries could correlate controlled buys with the movements of
individuals in a pool of suspects.  Also, creating spikes in demand
through multiple controlled purchases could prompt increased activity by
delivery agents during time frames of an attacker's choice.  Conducting
intensive surveillance of likely drop areas during induced spikes in
demand presents a more cost effective and less detectable approach than
maintaining intensive surveillance throughout a protracted series of
individual transactions.
Because compromising a given Dropgang operation would cost significant
time and money, I can not call the protocol broken - but it does look a
bit leaky.  As others have noted, most of the resulting risks fall on
the customers and delivery agents. However, a patient and well funded
adversary could work backward toward supply sources by carefully
observing known delivery agents and/or developing and recruiting "blown"
distribution layer agents as informants.  Hostile actors not constrained
by legal considerations could also infiltrate the distribution layer
with their own agents to facilitate efforts to work backward and
identify their sales layer controller/suppliers.
Information obtained and/or created though controlled buys, and
correlation of data sets derived from controlled buys and bulk
surveillance sources, seem to present the largest security exposures
inherent in the Dropgang protocol.
Reuse of dead drops presents a drop-dead security exposure for both
customers and distribution agents, so distribution agents should take
positive steps to prevent it.  Because many attacks against a well run
Dropgang operation depend on collecting data from as many dead drop
transactions as practicable, a smaller number high value transactions
present economic and security advantages over a higher volume of lower
value transactions.
I believe mid level distributors of contraband could profitably use the
Dropgang protocol to buy and sell bulk quantities of product, but not
those selling smaller quantities directly to consumers.

in the field of human intelligence, and that their efforts to penetrate
Citizen Labs harmed no one's interests but their own.  The academic
security researchers from Citizen Lab spotted NSO's wannabe intelligence
officers as hostiles at once, which comes as no surprise:  "Security is
security" in any context.  The Citizen Lab guise demonstrated a real
understanding of their subject matter by taking effective steps to steal
the initiative early, with (apparently) decisive results.

Speaking of which, regional so-called Bureaus of Investigation and even
Town Clowns also use 'disruption strategies' to reduce or eliminate the
effectiveness of political activists and other annoyances.
Step one, two gents in conservative suits visit your employer, flash
impressive ID cards, and obtain consent for a "confidential" interview.
 Then they start asking questions:  How well to you know The Subject,
have you seen any indications of X, Y or Z?  They won't accuse you of
anything, but their leading questions say that you are involved in dope
dealing, terrorism, child trafficking, or whatever else they judge will
frighten and/or anger your employer the most.
Kiss that job goodbye.
Your next employer visits the State labor department website to complete
an unemployment compensation form, and on the same day their phone
rings:  Your SSN tripped a filter, and an e-mail arrived at your local
Fusion Center. A watch officer grabs the script indicated, picks up the
phone and asks for an appointment to interview your new employer, again
on a "confidential" basis.  Needless to say, the new hire intake process
ends there and then with weak or no excuses made.
How does a person get on an enemies list like the one described?  Well,
bluntly refusing to inform on your friends will do it - especially if
you "turn" the asset who made the recruiting pitch, and/or feed him or
her intelligence designed to waste as much of the opposition's money and
resources as possible.  For instance if you "have reason to believe"
that certain people hanging around local activist orgs are Federal
informants, persuading informants working for your Town Clowns that they
are high level drug dealers might provide some harmless amusement.

Funny thing:  All the feminists I have known had a primarily anarchist
orientation.  I guess it depends on who you run around with - and/or
whether one's information comes from personal contacts or mass media
propaganda sources.  If that seems "wrong" look up Emma Goldman, Lucy
Parsons and Simone De Beauvoir.
Feminazis seem to have originated in the New Left.  Presenting a
caricature of reactionary Marxism, the New Left rose to prominence in
the 1960s, displacing and discrediting Liberal and Pacifist voices in
U.S. media during the Vietnam War.  I suspect these folks had US State
sponsors:  The FBI's funding and direction of terrorist cells in the
U.S. at that time (per evidence in Court cases acquitting "dupes")
indicates vigorous political warfare against home grown U.S. dissidents.
 Failure to field a media personality propaganda front demonizing
dissidents would make no sense at all.
Following a make-over in the late 70s & early 80s, the New Left and its
new recruits call themselves Progressives.  Working as freelance
profiteers under the sponsorship of folks like Our Mrs. Clinton and her
network, our Progressives continue to use every means at their disposal
- now a respectable arsenal of propaganda assets, astroturf fronts,
friendly elected officials, etc. - to discredit and suppress grass roots
Liberal and Pacifist political activism, not to mention anti-Fascist
organizers and anything resembling anarchism.

@_subject: Dropgang vulnerabilities 
Here's some ideas about structural vulnerabilities in the Dropgang
protocol, as described at Dead drop reuse:
To achieve acceptable security each dead drop may be used once only,
because hostile buyers could place 'their' dead drops under video
surveillance  and record every courier and customer visit to the drop
following their own transaction.
Couriers delivering to dead drops can not determine if their supplier
sends them to previously used dead drops, unless they service only dead
drops they set up and document themselves.  Couriers should transmit the
locations of drops they have developed only when presented with an order
to fill, to assure that their distributor can not send other couriers
and customers to use them first.  The added surveillance exposure of
making two visits to the same site - setup and delivery - presents less
exposure than trusting that the anonymous seller will never send a
courier to a previously used dead drop.
Sales layer incentives for reusing dead drops include faster service
during episodes of high demand for their products, and reducing the
payment demands (time & labor = money) of their pool of delivery agents
by reducing the need to develop new dead drops.  Compared to single-use
dead drops, reusing dead drops would enable distributors to reduce the
cost of compensating agents to select and document new dead drops by up
to 1/n the number of delivery agents employed, without disclosing to any
delivery agent that the distributor does reuse dead drops.  Absent an
active and aggressive adversary, reusing dead drops would present few
risks, so distributors may "get away with it" long enough to establish,
in their own minds, that reuse is safe enough, and "either way I am not
personally at risk."
In the context of potential reuse of dead drops by unwitting delivery
agents, isolation of the Sales layer from the Distribution layer via
cryptography and mix networking tends to create potential hazards rather
than removing them:  Exposing delivery agents to drop-dead risks may
cost sales agents some employees but has no other immediate
repercussions as no evidence implicates them in exposing service agents
to hostile actors.  Over time a sales layer actor who burns delivery
agents may run into trouble secondary to "cooperating witnesses"
assisting investigators working their way up the chain of product
custody; faith in the security of the protocol could easily lead some
bad faith actors to dismiss that possibility.
I noted that the article linked above endorses reuse of dead drops as
acceptable, by saying that "An ideal dead drop is however used exactly
once. Only then can the risks of using it be reduced to pure bad luck."
 I would hesitate to make purchases via the Dropgang protocol, because
customers have no way of assuring that hostile buyers did not visit the
same dead drops first - and some Dropgang advocates do not seem to
understand the severity of the risks associated with dead drop reuse in
the Dropgang context.
Dead drop profiling:
I believe the ability of hostile actors to in effect purchase dead drop
locations, and delivery timing information, presents as an Achilles heel
of the Dropgang protocol even with single use dead drops:  Controlled
buys would enable State or other well funded actors to map and profile
dead drop sites, reducing scope of counter-Dropgang surveillance from
"everywhere people can go" to target areas.
The more random-ish and widely dispersed the dead drop sites, the higher
the overhead in developing and servicing new drop sites due to travel
time, orientation to unfamiliar terrain, etc.  In most instances dead
drops will concentrate in the most convenient terrain for delivery
agents and customers.
As geographic clusters of dead drops appear in data from controlled
buys, more effective surveillance of those areas would follow.  This
observation suggests a security advantage when fewer, higher value
transactions are handled, reducing the number of data points available
to hostile buyers, and justifying more travel and effort to service
drops.  Bulk purchasers may also tolerate longer latency between orders
and pickups than end use consumers.  Higher latency reduces exposure to
timing attacks and retroactive surveillance.
Timing attacks:
Controlled purchases in conjunction with surveillance of suspected
delivery agents (distribution layer) enable timing attacks, as buyers
would know that the agent who filled their orders did so between the
times the orders were placed and picked up.  Surveillance State
adversaries could correlate controlled buys with the movements of
individuals in a pool of suspects.  Also, creating spikes in demand
through multiple controlled purchases could prompt increased activity by
delivery agents during time frames of an attacker's choice.  Conducting
intensive surveillance of likely drop areas during induced spikes in
demand presents a more cost effective and less detectable approach than
maintaining intensive surveillance throughout a protracted series of
individual transactions.
Because compromising a given Dropgang operation would cost significant
time and money, I can not call the protocol broken - but it does look a
bit leaky.  As others have noted, most of the resulting risks fall on
the customers and delivery agents. However, a patient and well funded
adversary could work backward toward supply sources by carefully
observing known delivery agents and/or developing and recruiting "blown"
distribution layer agents as informants.  Hostile actors not constrained
by legal considerations could also infiltrate the distribution layer
with their own agents to facilitate efforts to work backward and
identify their sales layer controller/suppliers.
Information obtained and/or created though controlled buys, and
correlation of data sets derived from controlled buys and bulk
surveillance sources, seem to present the largest security exposures
inherent in the Dropgang protocol.
Reuse of dead drops presents a drop-dead security exposure for both
customers and distribution agents, so distribution agents should take
positive steps to prevent it.  Because many attacks against a well run
Dropgang operation depend on collecting data from as many dead drop
transactions as practicable, a smaller number high value transactions
present economic and security advantages over a higher volume of lower
value transactions.
I believe mid level distributors of contraband could profitably use the
Dropgang protocol to buy and sell bulk quantities of product, but not
those selling smaller quantities directly to consumers.

"Socialized" people interpret their experience of the material world in
the context of an acquired "world view" which guides or, in most
instances, controls their perception and interpretation of material
conditions and events, and governs their responses to same.  To
"participate in society" necessarily includes compliance with dominant
propaganda narratives, at least to the extent of knowing them and
adjusting one's behavior to take their existence into account.
Example:  Our propagandists made an enormous Political Issue of Mrs.
Clinton's private e-mail server:  Both "because" it existed, and
"because" of bulk deletion of content potentially including criminal
evidence. But concurrently, our propagandists briefly and quietly
reported the bare bones facts of Mrs. Clinton's separate felony offenses
involving deliberate violations of the National Security Act, then fell
silent on that subject.
Mrs. Clinton reportedly removed classification markings from controlled
documents and forwarded them to people not cleared to receive them.  She
also instructed her staff to do likewise, a separate and even more
serious felony offense.  Mrs. Clinton's status as an attorney, and the
fact that she did sign a Classified Information Nondisclosure Agreement,
removes any doubt regarding her criminal intent and should qualify her
for enhanced sentencing:
"I hereby acknowledge that I have received a security indoctrination
concerning the nature and protection of classified information,
including the procedures to be followed in ascertaining whether other
persons to whom I contemplate disclosing this information have
been approved for access to it, and that I understand these procedures."
The simple, unambiguous nature of these e-mail related crimes accounts
for the (relative) silence of our propagandists on that topic:  No
defense or evasion based on accusations of partisan bias can 'make them
didn't happen'.  Mrs. Clinton can not pretend she "did not know" her
actions were felonies.  The refusal of Federal law enforcement to bring
charges demonstrates that Mrs. Clinton enjoys de facto immunity from the
legal system that governs lesser mortals.  As this bluntly contradicts
the foundational myth of "equal justice under law", under the rug it goes.
How lucky for Mrs. Clinton that the FBI simply "forgot" to impound her
computers and image their hard drives in the course of a criminal
investigation based on the content of those hard drives.  Even if she
had been charged, procedural stalling based on this circumstance would
assure that she died of old age before the disposition of her charges.
In context with the above, the Trump Regime's failure to bring
obstruction of justice charges against the Obama Regime's fixers in the
FBI indicates Trump's commitment to support "class privilege" and, most
likely, fear of retaliatory violations of his own class privilege should
he get "out of line" with anything but his mouth.

In real life I expect Nevada National Guard to meet the crowd, if any,
outside the base fence with lots of borrowed prison busses lined up and

On the Federal side of the fence, I would look into deploying microwave
fences and crowd control weapons (or pretending to truck them in, if
already built into the landscape).  Considering the physical terrain and
the need to avoid adverse publicity by causing grave physical harm to

Pardon my language - I do not MEAN to be sarcastic - but somebody needs
to "get a life."  Face to face IRL human contact, evolving into analog
trust relationships based on experience over time.  Long distance
relationships mediated by technology controlled by third parties can
provide significant advantages, but real value lives in the real world.
As an agency of the U.S. Federal Government, the DoJ exists for one
purpose only:  To enforce the 'legal rights' of absentee landlords and
maintain an environment favorable to commerce.  The State has no
agencies or departments dedicated to protecting the 'rights' of
individuals, except where/as this occurs as an incidental by-product of
the above described mission - and in these instances, "money talks and
bullshit walks."
Beware the Tar Baby Principle, a.k.a. "you are attached to what you
attack."  If harassment by State and/or Corporate actors prompts you to
expend all your energy fighting back against invulnerable enemies, they
win.  Is all.  End of story, end of game.
Is there somewhere else where applying your time, attention and energy
could achieve more valuable results?  Compared to wasting all of the
above, by definition YES.

From an article cited in the blog post referenced above:
?When the agency then fed those numbers back to the telecoms to get the
communications logs of all of the people who had been in contact with
its targets, it ended up gathering some data of people unconnected to
the targets. The agency had no authority to collect their information,
nor a practical way to go through its large database and cull those
records it should not have gathered. As a result, it decided to purge
them all and start over."
So... if this presents an accurate account of the NSA's statements, the
NSA has very obviously lied.  No "practical way to go through its large
database and cull those records it should not have gathered"?  When in
fact, a single query based on the unique identifiers of "authorized"
collection targets could grind through those records and delete all that
did not include such an identifier in any of the fields.  Granted, that
might have taken weeks to set up and test and days to run against the
'live' data, costing thousands of dollars worth of burn rate:  But that
constitutes FAR less than the proverbial drop in the bucket, relative to
NSA's staff, technology and budget resources.
An operation purging all but "contacts of contacts" would have taken an
order of magnitude longer, and so forth with 3rd hand contacts, etc.
But IF that database was of any potential use at all for targeting
people on enemies' lists for detailed social network profiling (as
intended), by definition a clean-up process falls within the scope of
NSA capacity and budgets.
My guess?  The specific program initially exposed by the Snowden docs
outlived its usefulness, as a next generation program doing the same job
"better, stronger, faster" displaced it.  That new program does not
exist for legislative and legal purposes, because nobody outside
compartments with authorized access to it knows it exists.  Considering
that U.S. public policy embraces mass murder "in The National Interest,"
just recording and saving everything that crosses the network for later
use in retroactive surveillance raises no possible "moral" or "legal"

Even harder to imagine, considering that the City of Seattle's IT folks

I find it more than easy to imagine that the NSA 'noticed' a giant
exfiltration of stored government-related communications crossing the

have placed both sender recipient under heel to toe electronic

Given that possibility, I also find it easy to imagine that "people"
listened in on the phone call about the accidental exposure with great

infrastructure from end to end.  When the question of the receiver
keeping all the excess data came up, I can picture somebody pulling the
plug on his connection, vs. breaking into the call and saying "oh no you

@_subject: The US government is involved in black magic 
I have got a theory that I have, which is mine, (etc.)...
- Anne Elk, Monty Python's Flying Circus
According to this theory that I have, the cattle mutilation reports
present as highly consistent with germ warfare research in progress.
The MK NAOMI papers tell us that our three letter agencies have release
"weakened strains" of pathogens in U.S. cities, and monitored hospital
admissions to track their spread.  So I see no reason they would
hesitate to do similar research on BW vectors in livestock populations.
 Why?  To develop both attacks and defenses against economic warfare by
means of epidemics affecting commercially valuable animals.
First and foremost, the nature of the wounds and the tissues collected
appear fully consistent with collecting specimens relevant to evaluating
the behavior of an infectious disease in progress:  Organs presenting as
potential sites for entry and/or initial infection by pathogens, and
blood which would indicate the metabolic and immune responses to
Second, in most reports it seems obvious that the samples were collected
by someone equipped with laser cutting tools:  Clean, straight edged
wounds that did not bleed - not even one drop.  As these procedures
whoever did it had to carry both the (then) rare and expensive laser
surgery gear /and/ its power source with them.
Third, helicopters.  I have seen reports where witnesses describe
hearing and, rarely, seeing helicopters at the sites where the dead
animals were later found.  "Black helicopters" do exist - 20 years ago I
saw three fly right over my house near downtown Orlando, at treetop
level.  I heard what I thought was a helicopter approaching from maybe a
quarter mile away, looked up, and they were passing directly overhead.
At the time I assumed they were on a training or demonstration flight.
These airplanes first became available at about the time the cattle
mutilation stories started to surface.
4th, no tracks.  The people who found and reported them saw no signs
that any vehicles had been near the animals until the folks who reported
them showed up.  No ranchers in these areas ever reported any signs of
ground-level intruders, as far as I can recall.  So, aircraft seem an
unavoidable part of the picture.
5th, no flying saucers.  I do not recall even one instance where a
mutilation report coincided by time and place with any reports
describing "classic UFO" phenomena, except where and as consistent with
the quiet helicopter model, i.e. stationary or nearly stationary bright
lights seen at or very near ground level.  I seem to recall a couple of
accounts where the lights were pointed at distant observers to obscure
whatever was going on at the sites.
Had the Hettrick murder been associated with a similar project or
program, I would expect to find multiple accounts of similar unsolved
murders - but a cursory search turned up nothing that looked connected.
 In the Hettrick case, a cursory review indicates that investigators
found no reason to doubt that her wounds were made by conventional edged
tools.  Maybe a fan of the Whitechapel killer and/or Ed Gein at work?
In re government involvement in "black magic," see papers associated
with Michael Aquino, and accounts of military PsyOps exploitation of
"superstitious beliefs."
Also check out the Stanford Institute, a CIA think tank in Marin County,
California:  SRI was famous for certifying Israeli stage magician Uri
Geller as an authentic miracle worker, but much more important as the
organization that produced the New Age Bible called A Course In
Miracles.  The Course, as its devotees call it, teaches a complete
circular argument world-view where wishing literally makes all things
so.  Therefore all who suffer for any reason voluntarily brought it on
themselves - by logical extension "social conscience" presents as a
correctable personal weakness.  I have seen devotees of the Course
demonstrate the results of this discipline in real life.

An interesting article, but a little long winded and jargon heavy for my
taste.  I like radical propaganda that does not alienate "regular folks"
on contact.
When I see "Libertarian as Conservative" I mentally respond, "So what
else is new?"  If the Libertarian ideology of its leading U.S. advocates
did not share key features with Conservative theory and practice, why
would Republican operatives have taken the trouble to co-opt the
Libertarian Party in a hostile buy-out back in the 1990s?  Today our
Libertarian speakers, authors and pretend-candidates work in tandem with
the Republican Party:  Both do their best to defend billionaires and
their corporations from taxation, fight against unions as a matter of
principle, assert the right of Corporate persons to destroy communities
and natural resources to enhance shareholder value for absentee
landlords, etc.
When I think about the word "Conservative" as more than just an
arbitrary label, I have to ask what the people involved want to
"conserve."  Libertarians I have personally known were interested in
conserving their Middle Class status - real, aspirational or imaginary -
against perceived assaults by lesser economic beings and, paradoxically,
the State tyranny that makes their preferred way of life possible.
Between Libertarian and Conservative I see differences in belief and
style, but not in motives and actions.  I would not describe
Libertarians as "Conservatives who do drugs," but maybe as
"Conservatives who have no use for fundamentalist religion."  I think
that hits the mark squarely.

That sounds like standard police work to me.  When an investigatory
agency receives a directive to take someone down, or individuals in such
agencies develop personal a personal grudge against someone, they shift
gears from passive observation to active harassment.
A very long time ago, I fed a snitch "bad information" on purpose, then
turn him against his buddies in blue.  He was fishing for information
about criminal activities some of my old friends never did, and that
for disposal, so my instincts did not mislead me:  I had nothing to lose
by kicking their shins...
According to my source, the principal technique police investigators use
to dispose of inconvenient people consists of interviewing their
employers, any 'friends of the force' they may happen to know.  Their
leading questions paint a picture of the victim as a member of a
terrorist conspiracy, an uncaught serial rapist, or whatever else the
interviewee would most strongly react to.
After learning all they can about the targeted individual from these
interviews, investigators sit back and let the seeds they have planted
do their work.  The victim usually finds him or herself unemployed soon
enough after the employer has "learned the truth."  Keeping the targeted
individual unemployed by poisoning background checks, and/or by
responding promptly with the above mentioned tactics when any new
employer files State documents (sometimes within hours these days,
thanks to Surveillance State infrastructure) follows.
How can a targeted individual turn this off?  In some cases, a criminal
conviction - any criminal conviction - might do the trick:  Mission
accomplished, etc.  In some cases, moving to another State might do the
trick - if the scope of the harassment does not extend past a County or
State agency.  Just maintaining a low profile and allowing time to pass
might reduce the active harassment below the threshold where it matters.
In some instances, explaining the situation to a potential employer in
advance of the approach by a hostile party might - but lots of luck
finding prospects who would not assume you're a paranoid looney.

terrorist conspiracy, an uncaught serial rapist, or whatever else the
interviewee would most strongly react to.
After learning all they can about the targeted individual from these
interviews, investigators sit back and let the seeds they have planted
do their work.  The victim usually finds him or herself unemployed soon
enough after the employer has "learned the truth."  Keeping the targeted
individual unemployed by poisoning background checks, and/or by
responding promptly with the above mentioned tactics when any new
employer files State documents (sometimes within hours these days,
thanks to Surveillance State infrastructure) follows.
How can a targeted individual turn this off?  In some cases, a criminal
conviction - any criminal conviction - might do the trick:  Mission
accomplished, etc.  In some cases, moving to another State might do the
trick - if the scope of the harassment does not extend past a County or
State agency.  Just maintaining a low profile and allowing time to pass
might reduce the active harassment below the threshold where it matters.
In some instances, explaining the situation to a potential employer in
advance of the approach by a hostile party might - but lots of luck
finding prospects who would not assume you're a paranoid looney.

If this took place before The Intercept burned Reality Winner, shame on
The Intercept.  If it took place after, shame on the leaker.
I saw a story indicating that prior to publishing the material submitted
by Ms. Winner, The Intercept called the Feds to verify that the zip code
on the package matched the facility their source told them it came from.
 Not certain this actually happened - but given what came next I do not
doubt it.
The Intercept published at least one high quality scan of a document
sent by Ms. Winner, with the printer's watermarks intact:  This told
world + Feds the printer's serial number, and time the document was
printed.  When I read about that, I went to The Intercp's site and
downloaded the image in question.  I bumped up the contrast and tweaked
its colors a bit:  Viola, the repeating watermark pattern jumped right out.
Starting on the date The Intecept openly and publicly burned Ms. Winner
- whether through shocking ignorance and negligence, or by design -
anyone who sends them 'dangerous documents' has no one to blame but
themselves the first morning they wake up in a Federal prison.

publication of docs apparently submitted to The Intercept by Daniel
Hale.  So, he had no obvious way to know where NOT to send TS dox.

The speed of light is a physical constant.  The frequency (or
wavelength) of a photon determines its energy and therefore, to the
human eye, its color.
Longer answer:
Our ability to perceive light, and construct models of what it's
bouncing off in realtime, has presented interesting problems to many
noted scientists over the years.  An illustrative example:

@_subject: OFFTOPIC: physics question 
Because light's speed is a physical constant, light separates into
colors when passing through a prism.
The higher the frequency of a photon, the higher its energy.  Since more
energetic photons can not speed up, and less energetic photons can not
slow down, they behave AS IF they had more or less 'mass.'
Higher and lower energy photons deflect slightly more or less when
forced to change direction in a refractive medium, in a way analogous to
heavier and lighter moving objects acted on by, for instance, the wind...

The article as a whole reads like a "defense" contractor's press
release:  Bombastic, overblown, factually inaccurate (i.e. pretends real
hard that facilities can not be hardened against super-duper microwave
beams), and even includes this barb against anyone who would dare
deprive the contractor of Yuge cash payouts:
Here's a cheap laugh:

Far be it from me to cry "old news!", but I read all about that project,

What that has to do with using drone-mounted microwave ovens to destroy
all the electronics in shielded bunkers, I have no clue.

The press serves two markets at once:  Their audience and their patrons.
 To acquire and keep audiences, press outlets report "news" as a series
of engaging dramas, in a context that encourages readers to identify
with players in the stories presented.  To acquire and keep patrons
(advertisers or grant writers), press outlets must frame their stories
in a context that supports the utility, desirability and/or practical
necessity of the products, services, etc. offered by their patrons.
The State serves one market:  The wealthy and powerful.  This service
consists  of codifying and enforcing the "rights" of absentee landlords,
providing arbitration processes for settling disputes among their
patrons, and providing armed enforcement services to maintain an
environment favorable to commerce.
The Press and the State answer to the same masters, and they serve
mutually supportive roles.  Where apparent conflicts between the News
Media and the Government do not present as empty posturing, they reflect
policy disputes among a country's rulers.  Press criticisms of the State
do not rise to the level of questioning the "legitimacy" of State
institutions and authority - at most the press presents symbolic and/or
self-defeating models of rebellion.
We can call the massive inertia of a collective delusion controlling
hundreds of millions of people from cradle to grave a "clown show" if we
want to pretend that we are above all that.  This Olympian viewpoint,
compliant with indoctrination by State, Media and Academic institutions,
presents as an example of "institutionalization."  But as a matter of
blunt fact, a civilization built on a foundation on murder and
intimidation, hell bent on destroying the planetary ecosystem that makes
its own existence possible presents very few laughs.  Rather the opposite.
The mocking laughter some indulge in seems to indicate internal
pressures that might, if not diverted to fuel a perception of personal
superiority, lead to actually rebellious activities.  That would not do.
 All properly institutionalized individuals know their place in the
status hierarchy and rebel only when and as they are told.  Like any
other animals habituated to their cages these folks may complain loudly,
but pretend they do not even notice open doors and gates - what lies
beyond represents the Unknown or even... horror of horrors... anarchy.

Heresy?  The word "Satan" means "accuser," and in the mythology he
functions as God's Prosecuting Attorney.  In real life I would prefer a
legal system based entirely on the 'tort' concept - let the injured
party bring suit, or in instances where that can not happen - i.e.
murder - let an ad hoc committee from the community do so.
Devising an anarchist legal system that does not immediately devolve to
heavily biased popularity contests and/or lynch mobs who may regret
their actions soon after, presents some pretty challenges.  I have not
tried but it sounds like a fun project.

That "is" business presents lots of pitfalls, especially when applied to
humans.  Assange certainly represents himself as anti-authoritarian, and
his actions speak way louder than his words on that front.
But our Libertarians present as crypto-fascists, given that implementing
their utopian visions would only remove the few restraints on our
present rulers, shifting the balance of power in society even further in
their direction.  Note that by "rulers" I mean folks like the 500
billionaires who presently own 1/2 the capital assets in the United
States, population 360 million or so.  "It takes about 3/4 million
peasants to support one dominant billionaire."  Not shocked yet?  Check
out this simple graph of U.S. income distribution, scaled relative to
familiar physical objects:
Assange does pay attention to political power in a process oriented
perspective.  See his "The non linear effects of leaks on unjust systems
of governance" (  ).  So I
doubt he could identify with the "Rand Fan" version of Libertarianism.
That leaves Anarchism.
Some anarchists do call themselves Libertarian, to avoid personal
blowback from the demonization of anarchists - one of the few propaganda
lines /all/ repressive States agree on - but somehow that don't sound
like our Mendax.  He does seem to favor the rights of local communities
over those of absentee landlords, which strikes me as an
anti-Libertarian position.
Like the Marxists before them, Libertarians present their proposed
changes as a bridge to Utopian anarchy.  But a familiar model involving
Lucy, Charlie Brown and a football seems to fit both cases...

@_subject: Facebook Users can now Appeal Freedom of Speech... to Facebook 
It appears to me that The Facebook recently modified its content
censorship policy for 'hate speech' and 'offensive speech.'
Formerly, someone who wanted to shut another user the fuck up would
report their posts as TOS violations, and someone - probably a
contractor with very limited English literacy - would glance at the
reported post and click a 'ban button.'  First offense, three days
locked out of posting.  Second offense within a given window of time,
seven days locked out.  Third offense within a given window, indefinite
suspension and/or account termination.
But as of a week or 10 days ago, the 'ban button' seems to produce a
different result:  A new error message replaces the reported post, which
I would guess still looks normal to the user who made the post.  I have
reasonable confidence that the new error message indicates a censored
post, because so far the users whose posts I have seen replaced by the
error message have a consistent history of posting stuff that skates
right up to the edge of Facebook TOS violation; so far I have not seen
an exception.
Simple explanation:  Users banned from posting largely abandon The
Facebook during their bans, and so generate little or no ad revenue or
(direct) surveillance data in those time frames.  Presenting false error
messages permits a lower threshold of censorship, without increasing
controversy over censorship itself or reducing The Facebook's per-user
So far I can only speculate.  But now that I have posted this, I should
remember to ASK the original posters about the content of "error message
posts." Oddly enough, these posts often have one or two visible replies
(not referencing the error message) which would enable affected users to
identify the posts in question - once informed that their posted content
