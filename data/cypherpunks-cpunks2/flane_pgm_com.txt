@_subject: [liberationtech] Can HAM radio be used for communication 
Thanks to Ali-Reza for reposting Dr. Dey's reply.
If you are looking for lowest-cost short to medium range communications  using ham radio, Android phones are not the answer. You still need VHF or UHF radio hardware.
There are at least 20 radio manufacturers in China that make small  variations on a common design of VHF transceiver, that can be bought for  less than USD 50 each (often much less). Radio repeaters can be built  using these same transceivers. There is also a huge surplus of  transceivers in the US that have been made obsolete by the FCC's narrow  band mandate, that you can buy for a few dollars, particularly interesting for higher power mobile radios. Shipping will be your major expense there unless you are able to do a freight container full at once.
The biggest problem in most countries is almost always getting legal  permission to use amateur radio for other public purposes. Solve that  problem for your group, and find out what frequencies and power levels are permissible, and the technical issues are much easier.
