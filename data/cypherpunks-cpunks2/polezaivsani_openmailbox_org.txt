Miners would need to interop with other chains in order to check
for cross chain double spends of pre-fork outputs. Yet the communication
between BCC and BTC seems unlikely given current state of affairs.

[2017-05-06 20:21] "Shawn K. Quinn" I bet on classical p2p systems. These have quite some road to walk
and definitely need all the help you can give.
Humans being humans, this ain't a magic pill, though the core
principles leave much less for them to slide back into a usual
p.s. Not a taxi you where looking for, though should you be into

for a while, but it's the same dirty business after they get big
enough of a following.
Such issues can be addressed by the protocol. I would be cautious
about it though as it implies some sort of global consent on the
subject and anything global is a) technically involved and b) of
dubious social merits.
As a half-way alternative, it might be a system of opt-in policies
where some property gets enforced amongst participants. That's just
my speculation though.
