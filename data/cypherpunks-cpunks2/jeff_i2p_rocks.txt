This is correct.
I am personally convinced that a flat traffic shape will only dare
attackers to cut links between parts of the network, effectively
making an even larger traffic shape to corrilate with.
I am not convinced low latency systems can be immune to traffic shape corrilation and hence that being said, I think state actors are out of scope of the current threat model of llarp. This may or may not change.

It's really really slow especially when you have to do it for every packet you send or every hop in a tunnel you build, it adds up fast.
In theory it'd be "really really expensive because of the coin aspect", in practice, no idea how hard it would be.
I am also not convinced the coin aspect will work the way it is being advertised but I am open to being surprised.
Loki is funding the development so they get the features they want.
I hope so, no way to know until we get there.

If the state is out to get you I'd just assume that everything arround you is rooted
and a wire tap and act accordingly.
Indeed, we'll get there eventually. I am just a guy that made a thing because I thought it was cool.
Let the record show that I am not the one making the sybil resistance claims
it's the coin team that is. I doubt them as well but I am open to being surprised. I orignally had another model in mind for mitigating bad actors
on the network that I still plan on implementing (eventually)
Effectively it's a f2f mesh connectivity layer to help hide traffic shape.
I am not arrogant enough to claim to be able to repell state actors from sqaure one.
