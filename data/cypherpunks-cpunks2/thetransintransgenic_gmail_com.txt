The friend I'm trying to help was just someone, nearby-in-the-social-graph
on Tumblr, who asked for help with securing communication and stuff.
Their specific situation is that they're about 15, autistic and bipolar,
and have both a very active and emotionally important online life, and very
invasive parents who wouldn't think much before cutting that off if they
thought it might help make them "easier to deal with"-like. I don't really
know -- I just offered to help.
This question was trying as much for specific for them, as general
strategies that minors can use -- I'm also thinking of one person from a
while ago, whom I knew better and who is thankfully in a much better
situation right now, who was using their abusive dad's laptop when
available and terrified of the possible and likely consequences if their
dad found the thread that they were getting sympathy, advice, and support
in. I'm pretty sure I've run into other kids who were concerned about stuff
like that. One friend is working at this problem, partially to use,
partially just to get a sense of infosec, partially just in case. After I
posted the original post here, another friend specifically asked me to
summarize what I learned from this thread, 'cause they expect to run into
people who need advice.
Mostly I'd like to be able to work out something that, if I run into
someone in a similar situation, I could say "Here, try this, this, and
this. Look for these things -- you can do that like this -- and if you find
this then you have to take this other precaution. And if you can, try
reading this and this and see if that's applicable to your situation." At
least as a start. And I'd like be able to share that like I can share "well
here's how you make it harder for Google/The Government/An Identity Thief
to get your info...".

Parents, yes, have a responsibility to raise their children, and as a
result have a bunch of extra privileges and a bunch more authority over
their children then any one person usually has over another. There is, for
very good reasons, a very strong power dynamic in a parent-child
And any power dynamic is prone to abuse, the stronger it is the more likely.
I'm am very scared of the idea of a power dynamic like that, where the
person at the receiving end has their communication completely monitored.
It means that, in case they need to ask for help, that request will be
monitored. And depending on how abused the power dynamic is, that could be
a Very Bad Thing.
Everyone needs a way to ask for help safely. Everyone needs a way to have
peers safely.
A power dynamic without those minimal checks is not a safe thing to have.
(Also, can I express surprise at seeing this opinion *here*? Like, I've
heard this sort of argument before, and it definitely has merits -- but I
Very Much did not expect it on the cypherpunks mailing list? Is there just
some sort of toggle? Do people suddenly go from "no reason that they should
be able to have privacy" to "spying and censorship are suddenly totally
wrong" when they reach the arbitrary age where they are Now An Adult? Was
"get breached" the only thing mSpy did wrong?)

There's a big difference. A nation-state attacker you assume is maximally
competent. Parents you don't. A nation-state attacker cannot personally
monitor all their citizens. Parents can personally monitor all their
children. As long as you aren't caught, a nation-state attacker cannot
arbitrarily restrict your movement. Parents can. Besides non-automated
methods such as looking up browser history, parents have a finite set of
commercially-available software, with a mostly common set of capabilities.
Nation-states have to be sort-of cautious -- if there was a mass-reveal of
total surveillance of everyone, there would at least be some blowback,
whereas there's not any social pressure on parents at all. In terms of what
they care about, parents will prioritize moral issues -- being gay, trans,
atheist, etc., among other stuff, depending on the family -- whereas
nation-states will prioritize direct plans of action against them.
There's probably a lot more differences, and I probably messed up on some
of them. Here's someone else's probably-pretty-inexperienced attempt at
threat modelling parents:
 .
But there's not "no difference".

Yes, I am. I'm assuming that, if someone were to see some sort of generic
parent solution, and they knew that their parents worked at the NSA and
were able to use specialized technical skills, then they would know that it
was just not applicable to their situation. But I'm assuming that that
would nevertheless be useful for 90% of people. Or am I completely wrong
about that?
I don't know exactly what I want/expected. Like, it would be absolutely
brilliant if there was some general,
accessible-to-an-arbitrary-more-tech-savvy-than-average-teenager, howto
security, possibly for simplicity specialized to parent-situations, but
accessible security is in general a huge unsolved and possibly unsolvable
problem. I suppose I was hoping to at least start.

I know that in general, it's impossible to secure a computer that you can't

almost definitely some sort of product, plus basic things like maybe

Heh. Yeah, parents don't even need to try to find a 5$ wrench.
There are smartphone-spying stuff, also, though. (*cough-mSpy-cough*
Are there any strategies to detecting that?
Also, money/resources is a major issue in this threat model -- I don't see
it likely that a child/teenager will feel like 35$/year for a little more
security is worth it. I'm not even sure if I wanna assume they'll be able
to put down 50$ for a Raspberry Pi and USB mouse and Keyboard.
Using some sort of VM sounds like the best solution, because it allows for
just minimizing when parents come to look. Unless, again, there is
screenshotting going on -- in which case, how would you detect that, maybe
running Tails as a VM and doing something that would definitely draw the
parents but not compromise much in terms of online friendgroup,
gender/sexual orientation they might be hiding, etc. Maybe looking at porn?
That would have to take into account the consequences of that vs. the value
of knowing that parents aren't looking.
But "VMs require specific drivers", I didn't know that. Shoot.
I wonder how well you could avoid problems by just using something like a
Tails LiveUSB at night...
