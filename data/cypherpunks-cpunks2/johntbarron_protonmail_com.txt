@_subject: Nikola Tesla: Futurist 
If you are not familiar with Tesla's theories in his later years, he explored fantastic topics like free energy, anti-gravity, invisibility, and time travel.
After Nikola Tesla's death, the FBI ordered the Alien Property Custodian to seize Tesla's belongings, even though Tesla was an American citizen. The National Defense Research Committee called in an MIT professor and well known electrical engineer to make sense of Tesla's notes in order to analyze if anything in them could be weaponized. That MIT professor was John G. Trump.
John Trump claimed that there was nothing of any real substance in Tesla's notes - but this was a lie. He knew that if the National Defense Research Committee realized what the notes contained, such as blue prints for a time machine, it could mean the end of the world. Although John Trump believed Tesla's time machine was plausible, it was not possible to create using the technology existing at the time.
John Trump later died in 1985 but not before entrusting Tesla's notes and their implications to the protection of his beloved nephew, Donald J. Trump.
Around this same time period, Donald Trump was known to use pseudonyms such as John Miller and John Barron, in partial homage to his uncle. However, there was another pseudonym he was to be known for, John Titor.
Trump, as John Titor, traveled to the future under the assumed identity of a soldier, where he discovered that America, and the entire world, had become a nuclear dystopia caused by radical Islamic terror.
John Titor began posting messages on several internet forums in 2000 and 2001, writing of events that happened in the timeline he had witnessed. He wrote of terrible events that would occur between 2000 and 2012. He could not name the cause at the time or the timeline may become unavoidable, see 'Death Ship' episode from 'The Twilight Zone' television series.
Trump traveled through time, amassing a fortune and making subtle changes, attempting to delay the future he saw for as long as he could - but that future is now coming. Trump knew that the only way he could have enough influence to prevent this future in it's entirety would be to become President of the United States of America.
