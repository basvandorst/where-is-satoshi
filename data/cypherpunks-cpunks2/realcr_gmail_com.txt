What would stop somebody from lying about his phone being broken? Are the
peers in the network should be his close friends or people that know him in
the physical world?

@_subject: Replacing corporate search engines with anonymous/decentralized 
Some ideas I had regarding searching:
- The web used to be some kind of its own index, back in the old days,
where you could get from one webpage to another using links. If you get to
think about it, links are not much different than a DHT: Every website has
links to some sites that are similar to that site, and maybe to some sites
that are a bit different. In order to find something specific you work your
way through the links just like you would do in a DHT. The introduction of
great search engines eliminated the need to put these kind of links in
websites. So that's one solutions, links. Kind of primitive, but I think it
used to work.
Maybe I could put it in a less primitive way: Assume that you search for X.
An example for a new search method could work like this: You are given 5
different things, and each of those you pick the one closest to X. Then
again you are given 5 things, and you pick again the one closest to X. And
so on. Maybe after a few iterations you get what you want. Just a strange
idea, though maybe it could made practical somehow. I like it because it
contains no analysis of words or phrases.
- Crowdsourcing the creation of the index. I think it was mentioned in some
of the messages on this thread. I believe that even the best algorithms and
analysis methods are not good enough to index websites the right way. On
top of that, All that SEO (Search engine optimization) that is so popular
these days makes a lot of websites full of fluff show up in the top search
results, which I think is really a shame. I suggest to those of you who
didn't, to check out freenet, just to see what it's like to have some real
content out there. It doesn't have much content, though the little it has
is worth seeing.
Regarding crowdsourcing the creation of the index, I suggest doing it using
some kind of incentives for people to do it, and in the same time some
trust mechanisms to make sure that the index crowdsourcing is not abused. I
don't write here about the technological tools to do this, though I do
believe we are getting close to make this kind of thing possible. Though, I
still don't fully understand how to classify the websites: Maybe keywords,
or some kind of similarity network/metric between websites.
Anyways, These were my 50 cents.

@_subject: Offst - A decentralized credit card 
Hi, I just published the first preview release of Offst.
Offst is a decentralized payment system based on mutual credit. It's an
open source project, written in Rust, licensed under AGPL3.
You can find the release notes and more information here:
Link to the project repository:
At this point Offst is only a bunch of command line tools, but I think some
of you can already experiment with it. Criticism and ideas are welcome!

@_subject: A plan for Offst mobile app 
Hey, Offst is a digital credit card, powered by trust between people. It is
an open source project, licensed under AGPL3.
So far the main development on Offst was focused on designing a reasonable
open protocol, and on developing the core parts of Offst. One thing that
was neglected was a good graphical user interface.
I recently began on figuring out what an Offst mobile app would look like,
and so I sketched an initial draft for what the user flow should look like.
You can find it here:
Any ideas are highly appreciated!

@_subject: Offset: A credit card powered by trust between people 
Hey list,
I am happy to announce the first public version of Offset: A credit card
powered by trust between people.
Check it out here: Any feedback is highly appreciated!
A short description about Offset:
Offset is a credit card powered by trust between people. Payments in Offset
are secure, fast and privacy respecting. In addition, Offset lets you pay
with any currency you like.
You can pay with Offset at the local grocery store by scanning a QR code,
or buy something online from the other side of the world, even from someone
you have never met. As a merchant, Offset gives you the freedom to sell
without having to pay the extra fees to a payment processor.
Most importantly, Offset gives you the control. Offset is free and open
source. There is no single “Offset server”, as Offset is fully
decentralized. Your Offset credits fit nicely into your mobile phone, and
you are the only one having control over those credits.
To use Offset you don’t need a previous credit history, a bank account, id
card, phone number or even an email address. You can open as many Offset
cards as you like, without having to pay any fees. Your Offset cards can
not be frozen, and your transactions can not be tracked.
Offset moves the power of issuing money from the state to the market
participants. Therefore, Offset credits are protected from inflation. While
the currencies of the world are constantly depreciating in value, Offset
credits hold to their original value.
