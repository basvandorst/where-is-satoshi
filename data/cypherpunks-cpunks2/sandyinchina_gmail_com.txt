It is the sender's job. No-one should be sending such stuff
to a public list since it serves no useful purpose. If your
client won't send clean ASCII-only email, then switch to
a client that will.
If senders do not do that, there are four options: flame
them to a crisp (off-list, please!), let every reader handle
it, remove the HTML at the server, or set the server to
drop such messages entirely. I'd prefer the last, with
an appropriate bounce message,

If you have an audio device free or can add one and are using
Linux, I'd say Turbid is the obvious solution:
Open source, available for over a decade, well thought out
and well documented. It even has a proof, using only some
quite mild assumptions, that it gives almost perfect entropy
in the output. What's not to like?
If you are on Linux, getting Turbid into your distro might
well be the most important RNG work you could do. For
If you are concerned with other systems, it might well
be worth considering whether Turbid could be ported.
It appears better than anything else I have seen
because it is the only one with a proof of randomness,
and as far as I can tell the proof is solid.

There is configuration info for some common sound devices.
Only people with a device for which a configuration file does
not already exist. If you have to do this, you can send your
file to the Turbid maintainer so others can use it without
having to do the measurements themselves.
Of course, then there is a trust issue. The maintainer may
not have the device in question, so he cannot verify. If
you want to verify, you are back to building a cable.
Without verification, it looks as though someone could
subvert Turbid for a device by submitting a suitably
bogus parameter file.
I'd also like to see a default parameter file, guaranteed
to give some entropy on a lowest common denominator
device. I'm not sure if that is possible.

That's not a good combination.
" As for databases and real-time programming, cryptography looks
deceptively simple. The basic ideas are indeed simple and almost any
programmer can fairly easily implement something that handles
straightforward cases. However, as in the other fields, there are also
some quite tricky aspects to the problems and anyone who tackles the
hard cases without both some study of relevant theory and considerable
practical experience is almost certain to get it wrong. This is
demonstrated far too often.
I'd say start with Ross Anderson's book. The 1st edition is online & free:
Either a bookstore or a university library should have the 2nd
edition, which I'm told is even better.

There are plenty of good online references for the issues raised in
this thread. I'll give two for each, a more-or-less standard reference
& a Citizendium article that I wrote much of & that may be easier
reading. Of course Wikipedia has both as well, and various crypto
texts have deeper detail.
