@_subject: Experts report potential software "back doors" in U.S. standards 
I was wondering what are your opinions on an open source project i am
developing decentralbank.com, i began building it as a colored coins
bitcoin wallet complementary to open transactions audit servers,which act
as multisignature wallets among other things,if colored coins were used
people would exchange the rights to the bitcoin stored in the audit server
and skip transaction fees, i thought this would be very useful for low
income countries where the transaction fee may seem exorbitant.
I will be using open transactions technology and will be expanding audit
servers which allow multi signature deposits to support colored coin
definitions as a way to create a decentralized asset definition storage for
colored coins. I was wondering if you guys think there is demand for this
or am i just wasting my efforts?
The repo is open source and located here Open transactions audit servers are part of the voting pools scheme for
those of you who don't know here is the link
