PRIVACY SHIELD: THE AMERICAN LOBBYING INVASION
July 12, 2017 · by Rachael Tackett · in Pirate Topic
It is difficult to know the true extent to which American corporate
interests and the US government continue to lobby the European Union and
its member states on the US-EU Privacy Shield agreement. In March of
this year, public records requests about Privacy Shield were sent to
data protection authorities across the European Union. To date, the vast
majority of EU data protection authorities have failed to release public
records on Privacy Shield.
_*Lobbying by American Corporate Interests
American corporations, such as Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, and
Twitter, use the Privacy Shield framework as the legal basis to transfer
personal data from the European Union to the United States. Civil
society groups [1, 2, 3, 4] have criticized the Privacy Shield’s many
flaws and lack of basic protection for personal data. Even the EU’s own
parliament has been critical of the agreement. The Article 29 Working
Party, the group of EU data protection authorities, has also expressed
serious concern and doubt about Privacy Shield. Perhaps the most glaring
inadequacy of the Privacy Shield agreement is that it allows for NSA
mass surveillance, in violation of EU law.
The European Union has a voluntary lobbying register. Google, Microsoft,
BusinessEurope, and DigitalEurope are four of the top eight lobbying
organizations by number of meetings with EU officials, according to
Integrity Watch. The transparency register lists Google and Microsoft as
being members of BusinessEurope and DigitalEurope. The transparency
register also lists Google and Microsoft estimating their annual
spending on EU lobbying as between €4 and €5 million Euros each.
BusinessEurope lists its estimated annual spending on the low side of €4
million Euros, while DigitalEurope is spending approximately €1.9
million Euros a year.
There has been a massive lobbying campaign by American corporate
interests on Privacy Shield in the EU. In addition to spending on
lobbying, the transparency register also lists meetings between EU
officials and lobbyists. In January of 2016, a couple months after the
EU Court of Justice struck down Safe Harbor (the framework before
Privacy Shield), Microsoft met separately with EU Commission Vice
President Andrus Ansip and Commissioner Vera Jourova on the issue.
American technology companies such as Adobe, Apple, Amazon. AT&T, Cisco,
Facebook (subsidiary in Ireland), General Electric, Google,
Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Symantec, and Yahoo! have lobbied EU officials on
the EU’s data protection standards. Several American financial services
companies, including Citigroup, JP Morgan Chase, and Mastercard, have
also lobbied EU officials on data protection standards. Trade industry
groups representing American corporate interests have also partaken in
this lobbying effort. The American Chamber of Commerce, the Business
Software Alliance, BusinessEurope, and DigitalEurope are also listed as
meeting with and lobbying EU officials on Privacy Shield.
Since the EU’s transparency registry is completely voluntary and there
are few sanctions for violations, some meetings with EU officials and
additional spending on lobbying may have never been registered. The
American lobbying invasion may actually be much larger than the records
on the EU’s transparency register suggest.
US Embassy Gets Involved
The US government is also engaged in lobbying EU member states to accept
the Privacy Shield agreement. In January of 2016, the US embassy sent
the Danish data protection authority (Datatilsynet) an email warning
that legal uncertainty about personal data transfers from the EU to the
US could harm business. The US embassy goes on to state that the EU
should not solve the problem by hosting servers and storing data in the
EU. The email also rather comically insinuates a denial of some aspects
of NSA spying by stating, “The allegations underlying the Schrems case
about U.S. privacy law and intelligence practices were based on mistaken
assumptions and outdated information.” The Datatilsynet confirms that
there was a meeting in May 2016 between their office, the Danish
Ministry of Justice, the US embassy, and the US Department of Commerce
about the Privacy Shield agreement.
In January of last year, the US embassy sent an email thanking the
Slovenian data protection authority (IPRS) for meeting the week earlier.
Several days later, the US embassy sent IPRS and the Slovenian Ministry
of Justice a rather ominous email. The email warns, “It is imperative to
conclude a revised U.S.-EU Safe Harbor agreement now, or risk harm to
economic growth and job creation on both sides of the Atlantic, as well
as damage to the broader transatlantic relationship.” The email also
pressures Slovenia to direct EU Commissioner Vera Jourova to approve a
new agreement to replace Safe Harbor. The US embassy also sent documents
to the IPRS, which the IPRS is refusing to release.
The data protection authority of Italy confirms receiving communication
from the US embassy about Privacy Shield. The data protection
authorities in Finland, Germany, Latvia, Romania, and Sweden deny
receiving emails from the US embassy about Privacy Shield. The data
protection authority of Austria refuses to confirm or deny if it ever
received emails. In response to questions about the possible existence
of emails, the data protection authority of Luxembourg (CNPD) had a
rather bizarre reply. The CNPD stated that Luxembourg does not have a
freedom of information law. In addition, the CNPD refused to answer
questions about the US embassy by citing Luxembourg data protection laws.
For now, the true extent of American lobbying remains behind closed doors.

All this talk of Riseup being anti-capitalist and people being selective
about their invites is rather amusing.
Maybe people on this listserve are not aware that Riseup.net (along with
LEAP) are listed as receiving over $250,000 USD from government funding.
And that was only the funding which could be confirmed. The few public
records I did receive are full of heavy redactions. Netherlands and
Sweden still have classified documents, but refuse to release them.
Along with some European governments, the US Department of State was
also involved in this funding mechanism.
I would really like Riseup.net to publicly say whether or not Riseup.net
still receives government funding or support. Hopefully, Riseup.net will
publicly disclose the funding it has received.

Hi, Privacy and FOI Activists,
The Privacy Shield agreement allows data transfers from the EU and Switzerland to the US. There are currently two court cases at the EU Court of Justice challenging the agreement. Privacy Shield may be illegal under EU law, because the agreement still allows NSA mass Back in mid-April 2017, I sent a formal request to the US government to declassify PPD-28 (Presidential Policy Directive-28), which was signed by former US President, Obama. The US government has refused to confirm the receipt of the declassification request and has refused to say whether the request is being processed. The full PPD-28 (including its classified annex) is part of the Privacy Shield agreement by reference. The US government is claiming (...lying...) that the PPD-28 limits NSA mass surveillance, even though part of this PPD-28 document is still The US government is refusing to accept declassification requests for Obama's records (including PPD-28) until January 20, 2022. This action by the US government may be illegal, but it would be difficult to fight the US government in court on this issue.
I may have run out of options to appeal the US government's actions in the US. I would like to know if there are any government agencies, political parties, private organizations, or individuals in the EU and Switzerland who I can contact and complain about the US government's behavior. If you have any suggestions or recommendations, please email me at ractack at mail.com
I am also looking for volunteers to file public records requests in the EU and Switzerland for Privacy Shield documents. If you are interested, also email ractack at mail.com
