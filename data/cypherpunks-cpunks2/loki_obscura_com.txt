@_subject: Pen register request used to force disclosure of SSL private keys 
When architecting a system, it is critical that the operator of the system should not have access to the keys at all. You can't be compelled to produce something that you don't have. It is not hard to do if it is part of your initial design.
Backup providers like SpiderOak seem to be doing this right. I have designed a number of systems with this type of security design. Rule  don't store clear text.
Rule  don't store decryption keys
Rule  don't do decryption on the server
Rule  treat all communications with people not implementing security on THEIR computers as insecure
Email security for systems designed to work with outsiders who don't use the tool are particularly problematic. The operator can use public keys to encrypt traffic as it arrives, but can easily be compelled to reveal the arriving clear text messages before encryption.
Is it the SSL certificate for the SMTP TLS that was being requested? It appears so from the transcripts. If that is the case, they are asking to access content that was stored in the clear on the previous mail server(s). This is hardly highly secured content. The HTTPS sessions might reasonably be considered more sensitive and secure.

@_subject: True necessity of Records? [was: CryptoSeal] 
It is not an easy problem. It is hard to make reliable and maintainable systems without keeping the kinds of logs and records that law enforcement might later want.
Even if it is your policy to delete records, it is easy for a court to order you to maintain any records that you are producing.
The only safe posture is to architect systems so as to never keep those records. Unfortunately that makes all kinds of other tasks more difficult. Therefor the whole service is more expensive to run, and may be less reliable.
For a dedicated privacy service like Anonymizer, that is a reasonable tradeoff, but it will be a hard sell to phone companies and such.
This is not to say that it would not be a good thing for these companies to have a short data retention window vs. the long period they have now, but it would not provide that much additional protection.
