Nobody but the most willfully delusional apologist could possibly look  at the history of this agency, especially but not limited to the last  year, and believe that the NSA is an agency with "good intentions".  Self-serving, corporate and political protectionists, yes. Good  intentions, nobody really believes that.
Lastly, isn't it a little (or a lot) arrogant to believe that an  agency that's fooled Congress and the President, lied to the American  people, and undermined the security of worldwide communications,  couldn't fool you too?

Which is *precisely* why I would trust information provided to me by a
capitalist than that provided to me by an idealist. A capitalist sees
everything as a product that will either further his desire for
success or hinder it. An idealist sees everything as a mission fitting
within their narrow agenda. A capitalist has much more incentive to
provide a good product (correct, accurate, information) than an
idealist who's sole goal is to further an agenda. Both have their uses
though and both can be manipulated to good and bad ends.
I disagree. The careerist journalists are "crony capitalists" in every
way. They know that, regardless of the accuracy of their information,
the 'other side of the coin' will smooth things over and keep the
public hooked on an inferior product. That's not a true capitalist.
That's one of my main arguments with socialists and other
non-capitalist believers: they point to our current system and say
'see, it's exploitive and hurts people!' and it does. But that's not a
true capitalist system. Will we ever actually have one? Doubtful. But
what we have now is definitely not a good example.

Actually, Cari, I've done a pretty extensive foray into Anarchism.
It's an interesting but, IMHO, completely unworkable system populated
by people who dream of a better, freer world, but have no chance of
actually creating it - not now at least.
What turned me off about Anarchism were people like you. People who
waved their moral superiority flag every chance they got and assumed
that anyone who supported a different view than theirs was ignorant or
didn't understand what Anarchy is. In a lot of cases, Anarchists are
their own worst enemy.
Well, Cari, from what I've seen from the Anarchist community, the main
goal that anarchist have is to abolish the state. This, of course, is
a means to an end (the end being personal freedom) but the goal seems
to be nearly single-minded focus on abolishing the state.
And yes, I know some anarchists will say 'some of us simply ignore the
state' and that's true. But, in reality, the main 'collective' goal
(and I use that term loosely) is to abolish the state. To confirm
this, just talk to any anarchist and ask them what the biggest problem
to humanity is. Most will stay 'the state'. How do you solve it? 'Work
to abolish the state'. Seems pretty single minded to me.
But, please, instead of ranting and wild arm-waving, educate me if I
am wrong. I would certainly /love/ to see a workable, large scale,
anarchistic plan. I admit I probably don't know as much about the
philosophy as you do. But, instead of just angrily cursing, why not
try to educate me? I know that's a bit harder than angry arm-waving
and cursing but it's probably more productive.
Actually, that /isn't/ capitalism. Why do you think what you read is
the case?  Maybe it's because of deals cut between governments and
corporations? Do you know what we call that intertwining? No, we don't
call it capitalism. We call is /fascism/.
And /that/ is one of the great things about capitalism: you can try
different things. You don't have to be confined to one narrow model.
You don't agree with it? Great! Go do something your way and nobody is
likely to stop you (except the predatory crony capitalists, but I
think we've established those aren't real capitalists, right?)
Perhaps I am. Just like a Utopian anarchistic society is a theory
that's never been proven. It's a different way of thinking, each with
positives and negatives. I think we're probably /both/ idealists in
our own ways.
You don't believe in the power of your anarchistic philosophy? Hmm,
perhaps that's the problem then! I assume, being a journalist, you
understand that words have multiple meanings and we use them withing
'contexts'. Using the word 'believe' in the context I did doesn't have
religious connotations at all. But I bet you know that. It looks like
you are upset and just lashing out at everything because we don't
agree. That's alright. I've seen your posts here and know you're more
intelligent than that. So, yes, you're a 'believer' or...at
least...you should be.
Oh I understand it very well. I suspect it's you, who's obviously
stuck within a very narrow worldview, who may not understand it. I've
read Ms. Klein and I like a lot of her work - I don't agree with all
of it, but I like it. But you know as well as I do that she comes at
the topic with a bias. Also, from what I've read, her main beef seems
to be with globalization and the influence corporations have on
governments and, thus, the people. Remember, we've already covered
this: it's not capitalism but /fascism/ when you have that.
Do you have any thing in particular by Ms. Klein you'd like me to read
that may help 'educate' me? I'd be happy to give it a go. So far, I've
only read "No Logo", "The Take", and "The Shock Doctrine". Anything
else I should pick up?
Yep, saw this video series. Brilliant woman, great book. Still talking
largely about fascism and not capitalism. I mean, sure, she uses the
talking fascism.
So, do you believe that the horrible things that happened in Iraq and
GITMO wouldn't have happened if the corporations weren't involved? I
agree that they probably wouldn't have happened on such a /massive/
scale simply because their would have been a manpower shortage but I
suspect some of those 'true blue' soldiers wouldn't have had much of a
problem picking up a chemical light and sticking it up someone's
ass...or raping them.  Were the naked pictures of prisoners at Abu
Ghraib capitalism at work too? Oh, wait, those were soldiers, not
businessment trying to make money.
I certainly admit that I don't understand it as much as /you/ do or
many others who spend a good amount of their time researching and
reading anarchistic thought. But I do have a good understanding of it.
However, feel free to point me in the direction of some good
educational material. I'll read it happily! I like exploring different
thoughts. I actually /like/ the idea of anarchy, just like I like much
of the ideas of socialism. But they both, IMHO, fall a bit off the

Good response, Patrick. But how do you think we're going to get to

Personally, I'm going with D but with some caveats. Snowden has long

the type of man who'd put the entire world's security at risk just in
the interests of US National Security.
This is why I've long been an advocate of total disclosure. I think
the document holders should publish everything they have. After they
do that, they could continue to 'leak release' documents with detailed
explanations for those who are too lazy or too confused by the
documents to sift through them and read them but having a document
dump out there would make the process of disclosure /much/ faster. And
it would freak the NSA out - a happy plus. I say fuck national

Good response, Patrick. But how do you think we're going to get to
that? Without concerted action, and it has to be more than everybody
doing their own thing IMHO, how will that goal be achieved? I hear a
lot of anarchists saying what you say and it's a fantastic goal. But
how do we get there?

I saw this a while back and really question it's usability. While it's  *technically* possible, it seems far to complex for the average hacker  and far too risky for the intel community.  People who use encryption  tend to be slightly more paranoid than the average user. Suddenly  receiving a piece of encrypted, nonsense email might be enough to get  their key. But I also suspect that, in many cases, that key would  quickly be revoked and reissued.

I wonder how long the good but misunderstood people over at NSA knew  about Heartbleed and didn't disclose? I mean, certainly "protecting"  us would necessitate them coming forward, right? The wouldn't  deliberately leave the entire country vulnerable just so the could  keep spying, right?
Good people, my ass.

I agree that there is no proof that this bug was introduced on purpose
and it might be a simple oversight (no matter what it looks like or
could be). We have to keep in mind that one of the things spies do is
sow suspicion and doubt - it's a powerful weapon! All these
vulnerabilities we're finding in critical software /might just be/
mistakes and oversights. Or they might be deliberate attacks by the
NSA/GCHQ. Part of the power these agencies wield is that /we'll likely
never know/ and so we suspect...everyone. Everything.

@_subject: Why didn't Snowden disclose Heartbleed (and others)? 
Hash: SHA512
Personally, I'm going with D but with some caveats. Snowden has long
preached the 'encryption works but the endpoints are so weak that it
often doesn't matter'. I've always read this as 'encryption works when
it's done right. And it's almost never done right'. This might have
been a hint about Heartbleed, but I doubt it. I don't see Snowden as
the type of man who'd put the entire world's security at risk just in
the interests of US National Security.
This is why I've long been an advocate of total disclosure. I think
the document holders should publish everything they have. After they
do that, they could continue to 'leak release' documents with detailed
explanations for those who are too lazy or too confused by the
documents to sift through them and read them but having a document
dump out there would make the process of disclosure /much/ faster. And
it would freak the NSA out - a happy plus. I say fuck national
security. These guys are burning down the entire world just to further
their agenda. They deserve no consideration, even if it does put them
at a disadvantage.

First, let me say I'm sorry if this is posted twice. My mail client gave
me an error and, since I still haven't seen it hit either list, I'm
sending it again. My apologies if this is a duplicate.
So I'm looking through the Der Spiegel data dump and noticed the
following statement on document 35543:
"The client must not be running a Tor router of their own..."
That made me thing of a few questions but I'm specifically wondering
what they mean here.
1. Do they mean that it is confusing to them if I am connecting to the
Tor network from a computer that also runs a relay but I do not have my
client configured to use my relay
2. Do they mean that it is confusing to them if I am connecting to the
Tor network through a relay running on my own machine?
Perhaps I'm not even asking this question correctly as it 'feels' like
the wrong way. But I'm curious. What are your thoughts?

@_subject: Replacing email with XMPP...why not? 
I've been reading a lot about the need to replace email and I'm not
quite sure why we're not moving to an XMPP based model. It seems
rather perfect for this kind of thing:
1. Federated
2. Users are already familiar with the addressing format
3. Easy to use, could easily integrate with existing email
4. Easily piped through Tor or i2p or whatever
Security could be handled by using OTR the first time users happen to
be on at the same time and exchanging PGP keys automagically with some
kind of validation that the user can actually understand in place.
I really don't see this as incredibly hard to build. Why are we not
seriously looking at it? Sure, it doesn't address meta-data (it
probably could though) but it's a step away from traditional email and
towards something new.

Agreed. From running an XMPP server, XMPP does (or can) have store and
forward capabilities but that is something that would need to be
addressed. For maximum security, there needs to be a way for the
messages to be encrypted to a key controlled by only the recipient
while it's sitting on the server. I suppose using PKI could accomplish

It's not just about who cares more about your data.  Most people don't have a solid enough understanding of security to protect their item data.  Just because it's on your computer doesn't mean it's any safer from being grabbed than it is on the public cloud.  Sure,  you could take the time u to learn good security but most people won't.  That's just a utopian dream.
