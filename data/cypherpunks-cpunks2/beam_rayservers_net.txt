"By working together with those that harvest value from nature, Google
can quickly create a truly non-evil system for all.
We suggest that the “there is one way and that way is secure,
economically-viable-and-self-extending, anonymous and untraceable” is

IMHO there is no point to blame one entity or one electronic payment
system for online transactions when the international bank/finance
regulations (acts, bills, laws, legislations) encourage/force data
collection/merging/profiling/sharing everywhere all the time.
But you point in the right direction to an old topic on the cpunk list.
To begin, at the beginning: *financial privacy issues*
The good news is the emergence of new fintech based on new financial
cryptography systems which will ensure financial privacy.

My first impressions it is hosted on amazon...
My questions:
How is it secure?
How the pubkey is transfered?
Is it encrypted from server to client?
How do you manage MiTM?
I am sorry to play the devil advocate here but at the moment, this is a
true LoT => Lack of TRUST
Please secure your infrastructure, secure your servers until you are
able to provide a secure openpgp keyserver service and a secure
encryption message service.
Yes ;)
Please stop spreading invitations.
