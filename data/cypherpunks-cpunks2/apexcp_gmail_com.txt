No, the Government Never Asked Linus Torvalds for a Backdoor in Linux
"Oh, Christ. It was obviously a joke, no government agency has ever asked
me for a backdoor in Linux," Torvalds told *Mashable* via email. "Really.
Cross my heart and hope to die, really."

I saw TMP going away,  very interesting. However, I think the absence of a
seizure notice says it all. The owner, like others, probably decided to
quit while he was ahead and out of cuffs. What is funny is that no bitcoins
will likely be lost because TMP uses multi sig, so the feds can't take
anything without other the buyer and seller agreeing.
That's not to say that I have a definitive answer but that was my read on
the situation.

Does anyone have ideas about who would be the right person or people to
follow up with about this? The school and researchers front doors seem
closed to queries, maybe there is a side door somewhere?
