Hello all, "scientist" (PhD candidate) here in the field of computer
science and cyber security.
Most of the scientists I have encountered are not totally malicious, just
oblivious to the moral, ethical and political consequences of their work.
They are blind enough to believe that their "advances" help society,
despite them actually shifting the balance of power away from the people.
There are a few, however, who do what they can to shift power back into the
hands of the people. I was greatly influenced by a paper by Phil Rogaway
entitled "On the moral character of cryptographic work," and I try my best
to do research that works for the benefit of the people, not governments or
wealthy power holders. Only time will tell if I am successful, but I will
do my best.
There are others who also work with morals in mind. It is not so black and
white as "scientists are evil people working for fascists." They are just
unaware of the consequences of their work.

Hello Tom,
I do not claim that science is the enemy. It is the opposite. If I believed
science was the enemy I would not be working towards my Ph.D.. I am simply
pointing out that the current system is quite screwed up.
Science is the process by which we discover and understand the truth. In
that form, science is wonderful. However there has been a large switch away
from discovery and towards creating products for wealthy influential
players, at least in the computer science field. The scientific curiosity
has become about what will make money, not what is true.
Additionally, science is not without limits. We, as scientists, cannot
perform experiments that harm people. We also cannot perform experiments
without consent. I would also suggest that our ethics should include
avoiding projects that harm the people, such as creating mass surveillence
systems and facilitating the violation of basic human rights. If we perform
such research, we should also include counter-measures to preserve the
balance of power. Scientific research influences all of society, and should
therefore consider ethics before publication.
In short, science and the scientific process is not truly the enemy.
Currently, however, the system has been corrupted by wealthy players who
abuse it for personal gain.
If you have not read the paper I mentioned in my previous email, I really
do suggest giving it a read. Rogaway argues many different points in the
paper, many of which I haven't covered in my emails.

@_subject: Welcome To Anarchast! 
Intereating! I will have to check these links out.
Anarchast is your home for Anarchy on the internet.
To us, Anarchy means freedom.  The desire to live without a violent,
coercive State.  Anarchy is peace, love and prosperity.
Sounds lovely. I could get on board.
  Free markets.
And, power to the people.
Power to the people. I'm all for that.
Anarchast is the world's largest anarchist/anarcho-capitalist video
podcast in the world with 3 million views on Youtube and millions of
audio downloads as well as being broadcast on satellite radio across
the world and on more than 40 terrestrial radio stations in the US.
Here is where I start to have questions. To my understanding, anarchy is
the rejection of heirarchies. Isn't anarcho-capitalism therefore an
oxymoron? The existence of currency inherently creates a heirarchy based on
the amount of currency one owns, does it not?
Anarchast founded Anarchapulco, the world's first and largest
anarcho-capitalist conference held yearly in Acapulco, Mexico.

I proposed nothing. I simply asked about something I was unsure about.

No, anarcho-capitalism is grounded in the understanding that free
trade among free people is a the only road to peace and prosperity.
People arrange themselves in hierarchies all the time, and it's no
crime if they do so freely.
For the life of me I can't think of any heirarchies that aren't, at least
in part, founded on deceit or force (or both). Can you please give an
example of one?
It's often a benefit. This is as opposed
to anarcho-syndicalism or various other flavors of anarchism, which
are grounded in the belief that money and trade are evil and that love
and unicorn farts are sufficient to sustain life.
I do not know these schools of anarchism, but that doesn't seem like a fair
No, it does not. There are lots of things to unpack in that
statemen/questiont, but I'll just mention two:
     - Currency isn't money, as such
     - Fiat currency creation is used by anti-capitalist forces to
enrich the few at the expense of the rest of us, destroying capital in
the process.
Reading some Murray Rothbard or Ludwig von Mises for starters, would
be an eye opener for you.
Fair enough. I will give some of this a read. If I have any questions, can
I reach out to you after I have read some?

That may or may not be true, but either way I gain an advantage from
reading it. If I agree with the messages in the readings, then I gain a new
viewpoint. If I disagree, I understand how they think and can perhaps
better counter their viewpoints through better counter-examples, etc.
