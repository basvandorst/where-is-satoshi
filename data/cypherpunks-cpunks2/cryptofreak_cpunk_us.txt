I completely support the idea of disloyalty oaths. The only problem I
see is that they simply wouldn't work. What we'd see is the government
putting increased threat of criminal prosecution on the corporate chain
and not enough corporate officers willing to risk going to jail in order
to do the right thing. Marissa Mayer from Yahoo said as much in her
Techcrunch interview last week.
The only option I see is that the public simply refuse to do business
with the offending companies and do business with their foreign
counterparts; take the money out of the US and do real harm to the US
economy in the process. When major companies start failing and everyone
knows it's because they betrayed their customers, the government will
have to respond. It's already starting to a degree. Microsoft and Google
have already said they're experiencing real financial loss because of
the NSA revelations.
We need to vote with our money. And we need to be willing to accept
'less viable' solutions for a time while other companies ramp up their
services. Are Americans willing to go that far? I'm not too sure. We
want comfort and convenience. Often, principles take a back seat to those.

Perhaps I'm being overly pessimistic but I can't imagine this kind of
thing happening on a routine basis. If anything, it looks like the
government is closing ranks and increasing the indoctrination of their
employees. I fear that we're going to see fewer and fewer people with
the courage of Edward Snowden as we move forward.
It's nice to think that conscience will win in the end but I honestly am
starting to see just the opposite. This is why I think we're going to
need groups like Anonymous and others who are willing to do straight
infiltration in order to find the truth. We can't rely on those who are
already in government to get a fit of conscience.

You're right, I did miss the point of your email. I get it now. Thanks

In a winner-take-all system like the US, third parties are irrelevant, except
insofar as they (like Bernie Sanders) caucus with one of the duopoly.
Birgitta Jonsdottir gets good press as a PP member of the Icelandic Parliament.
FOr what that's worth.
