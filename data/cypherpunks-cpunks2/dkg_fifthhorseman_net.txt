I don't think that's the main reason Tor has little public support.  I think Tor has little public support because using Tor is slower and less convenient than not using Tor, and people (at least in the USA) seem to value convenience above most other things.
This would not be anonymous data.  You're asking people to publish their full internet histories for the privilege of being able to use the network.  Are you aware of the work being done toward de-anonymization of rich data sets?  I think many people's web browsing habits alone would be sufficient to discover their physical identity with relatively high certainty.  Even if we were to assume that the data was not possible to tie back to someone's physical location to put them in harm's way, if their network use patterns are how they do their activism, then publishing their network use patterns provides an adversary with a lot of information that is very helpful to disrupt this same activity (e.g. "Which web sites do they usually use to distribute their [tools|analysis|incitements]?  Which chat channels do they frequent?  Where/how do they get their e-mail?  Can we destroy or subvert those services?)
If you prefer this, then you should personally make arrangements with ChinaCat directly.  I'm not convinced that you could ever make such an arrangement scale cleanly without gross oversimplifications that wouldn't meet many people's assumptions about what the terms mean.  Is a sit-in at a restaurant "non-violent free speech"?  What about a work stoppage at a factory?  how about when the workers barricade the factory against its owners?  What about people who sabotage or destroy machinery in their factory?  What about destruction of machinery that is prepared to destroy desparately needed housing stock?  What about people who smash the windows of low-wage corporate franchises?  What about smashing the windows and doors of fire-prone sweatshops?  Are all of these things non-violent free speech?  can you imagine that someone else might have a different answer for any of them than you do?
I think it would be worthwhile to spec out such an algorithm, and then think through the spec under a handful of real-world use cases.  what does it mean to do "network flow over trust edges"?  What specifically does "trust" mean in this context?  Can you give an example of how that would let you automatically determine how much you trust someone?  What does that kind of automated trust discovery mean from a human perspective?  What are the ways it could be exploited by an adversary intent on causing trouble?
sorry to be a pessimist, but i'm not convinced this is an effective or even desirable framework.
