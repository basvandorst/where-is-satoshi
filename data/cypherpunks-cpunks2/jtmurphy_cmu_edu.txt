A quick search shows that this privacy policy is spreading.
How can I stop it? I get the feeling calling management's phone isn't
going to do much.

I went ahead and tried it out. One click to make a key and it integrates
into gmail. It's not going to replace PGP for anyone who already has a
key pair, but making end-to-end encryption one-click-easy is a shoe in
the door for getting the public to start caring about its own privacy
(and hence ours).

It imported my ascii armored RSA public key just fine. Upon testing, it
correctly sent a signed and encrypted message to my RSA key's associated
email. I was not able to verify the signature though since gpg doesn't
support elliptic curve keys (I wonder why not). Presumably (hopefully)
gpg will be adding EC support in the future and this will no longer be
an issue.

On this machine I'm using
gpg (GnuPG) 2.0.22 (Gpg4win 2.2.1)
libgcrypt 1.5.3
I never noticed the two '?'s in the supported algos before.
Supported algorithms:
Pubkey: RSA, ELG, DSA, ?, ?
Cipher: IDEA, 3DES, CAST5, BLOWFISH, AES, AES192, AES256, TWOFISH,
        CAMELLIA128, CAMELLIA192, CAMELLIA256
Hash: MD5, SHA1, RIPEMD160, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, SHA224
Compression: Uncompressed, ZIP, ZLIB, BZIP2
Perhaps they are ECDSA and ECDH. In any case gpg --expert --gen-key
doesn't give the option for elliptic curve keys. I guess this is a
developer branch only feature for now.
