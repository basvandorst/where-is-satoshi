@_subject: FLYINGPIG // Tor 
The Tor Project responds:
You might reply 'well, they would say that, wouldn't they', but I think
the Tor community has long assumed that the authorities have something
like what Andrew Lewman describes and would be shocked if they didn't.
Also, this guarantees nothing, but Edward Snowden, who presumably knows
exactly what that QUICK ANT tab does, still has enough confidence in Tor
to have the logo stuck on his laptop lid.
