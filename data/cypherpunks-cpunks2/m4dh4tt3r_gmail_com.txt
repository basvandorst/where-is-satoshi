entire drives like a USB?
Like Apple’s FileVault2, which Apple has a key to.
The comment about Apple is simply false. Apple does not have a key to
FileVault2 unless you escrow your key with them. I know this because a dear
friend recently passed, and his family was not able to gain access to his
encrypted drives through Apple.
That said, FileVault2 is susceptible to offline dictionary attacks on the
password, or if you can get access while the drive is online, there are
attacks on the Keychain.
What makes you think open source will save you? All the eyeballs looking at
the code? That was proven a false sense of security when heartbleed was
started with OpenSSL on the command line besides the man pages?
