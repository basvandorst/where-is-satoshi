PUBLICATIONS AND SELECTED PRESS
openPDS allows users to collect, store, and give fine-grained access to their data all while protecting their privacy.
With the rise of smartphones and their built-in sensors as well as web-apps, an increasing amount of personal data is being silently collected. Personal data–digital information about users’ location, calls, web-searches, and preferences–is undoubtedly the oil of the new economy. However, the lack of access to the data makes it very hard if not impossible for an individual to understand and manage the risks associated with the collected data. Therefore, advancements in using and mining this data have to evolve in parallel with considerations about ownership and privacy.
Many of the initial and critical steps towards individuals data ownership are technological. Given the huge number of data sources that a user interacts with on a daily basis, interoperability is not enough. Rather, the user needs to actually own a secured space, a Personal Data Store (PDS) acting as a centralized location where his data live. Owning a PDS would allow the user to view and reason about the data collected. The user can then truly control the flow of data and manage fine-grained authorizations for accessing his data.

@_subject: Get offa my lawn. (was Re: [Cryptography] BitCoin bug reported) 
Dang kids. Get offa my lawn.
It’s been interesting, I’ll say that much. I have people on their honeymoon here in .ai asking to see me, buy me and Mrs. RAH $30 hamburgers at Viceroy, etc.
Or “prove”, “stylometrically", on various Bitcoin fora, that I'm Satoshi. Heh. I’ll never get tired of braggin’ about *that* one. :-) I expect others here know where the stylistic clues came from, but I think Grigg has the right approach to that question. Leave well enough alone.
Being, even now, generally optimistic about the future, if not my own in particular, I can’t help thinking there’s a pony in there somewhere. I *do* find it annoying that the only time people wanna talk to me about this stuff is at the top of a bubble. I expect that it may be a hint from the Almighty I should pay attention to. At the moment, PayPal, which we all looked down the nose at back then, is still, um, printing money, and a cypherpunk gave me some BTC a little while ago, a kind of eating-the-dog food exercise for old time’s sake. Or something. The price has since fallen 40%, but it’s bouncing back, and will probably be fine. “You have to be *this* tall to take this ride”, as another friend said about Bitcoin prices last week. Meanwhile I can’t think of anything I want to spend it on anyway.
Even in its current form, Bitcoin makes rather short work of those speed bumps Mr. May used to tell us about, which *may* be the real point to the exercise.
Having to file several kinds of forms to get paid for a small consulting job as US citizen outside the US was enough to make me foreswear getting paid for much of anything anymore, anything small at least, and BTC solves several problems there quite handily, push ever came to shove. Besides, my passport is stamped “Employment Prohibited”, which, apparently, I’m evidently honoring even in the breach.
So, I think BTC, or something like it, would make a nice numeraire, temporary or otherwise, having gnawed at the edges of *that* problem when most of the Bitcoinners were, as Marc notes, in short-pants. Yes, even in its current volatile state. And contrary to the opinions of people who know better than I do about these things.
It wasn't quite what Dr. Fama got the Nobel for, but New Monetary Economics might be as good once as it ever was, and Bitcoin might be the camel’s nose under that particular tent, and given that it is the ultimate fiat currency that’s quite an assertion.
As someone whose stated goal, back in the day, was to securitize *everything*, debt, equity, cash, services, title to assets in storage, transit, or just sitting there with a house on it, cats, dogs, mass hysteria -- and all derivatives thereof -- using bearer-transaction financial cryptography protocols on a ubiquitous geodesic public internetwork, Bitcoin *is* a bit, oh, please let me say it, self-referent as a solution. I saw it blow by here on this list, said, “meh”, shortly had the magic smoke go out of most of my internet presence by a power-spike in a hurricane, and never got around to paying attention to either Bitcoin, or the internet, very much at all until various people frog-marched my attention back into focus recently with me muttering variously about being too old for this shit anymore...
So, Bitcoin, if it survives, makes a *nice* hack, by solving, what Barnes, and ultimately everyone else, called the “loading problem”. And, so far at least, it solves the “and then you go to jail” part of the book-entry transaction error-handler, something Barnes was also noted for saying. That, too, only if Bitcoin survives. "...any [network] architecture that can survive a nuclear attack can survive withdrawal of government subsidy...” Godwin said on Cyberia, long ago. I’ve jokingly called it his Second Law. I suppose the Strong Form of that hypothesis, speaking of Dr. Fama, is surviving not mere withdrawal of the implicit subsidy of monopolistic contract enforcement, and all transfer-priced assets and “externalities” appertaining thereto, but also active attack from the ostensible contract enforcer itself.
I hear of others, well, gnawing around the edges, actually, of securitizing other stuff with variants of the Bitcoin protocol, but, like predicting the end of the world, expanding the blockchain to other assets "has not been found agreeable to experience.” So far as I can see.
Meanwhile, Chris Odom, aka, “Fellow Traveller”, aka, “Lovedrop” (yes, *that* “Lovedrop”), is banging away on something called Open Transactions, which inserts an actual transaction protocol, among other much more interesting things, into the works to glue Bitcoin and other stuff onto, for starters, Wagner Blinding, using, for starters, Ben Laurie’s lucre code. I haven’t seen a code-stoke like the one I see Chris with, well, since the old days. Which is nice. Very nice. Big grins all around, down here in the elbow of the Caribbean. Apparently, like me, he noticed that he was delivering instantly-usable product now, and getting paid later, too much later usually. I discovered cypherpunks in late spring of 1994 looking for a solution to something Barnes (again) called the “latency” problem. Chriss bumped into the gold-silver-crypto list, I think, about 10 years later.
Mr. Odom has been been kind enough to involve me in testing OT a bit, and, ultimately, I’ve more-or-less bailed on iterative break-it-and-fix-it. Mostly because I don’t have the patience for testing — much less writing — code, if I ever really did. But here’s the rub, I also I have no *idea* what I, personally, would do with Open Transactions these days even if I could get it running in production.
I have lots of ideas in *general*, you understand, but they’re mostly of the “let’s you and him fight” variety. Many more people than *I* would have to be involved, they, and I, would risk much more than money, and, ultimately, I’m not sure any of it would work. It’s a drag to think that most of what I’m interested in doing requires the dissolution, or at least dissipation, of The World’s Only Remaining Superpower to happen. As someone who still, barely, calls himself mostly an anarcho-capitalist but still a patriot, that’s about the only thing worse than only being interesting to other people during the top of a bubble. Yup. A Mass of Contradictions, as usual.
"Let’s you and him fight" is only two or three steps removed from Mr. Briceno’s original observation, I figure.
Hell, even “set here next to the rockin' chair, sonny, and I’ll tell ya a story”, is, ultimately, not much more help than “get off my lawn”, when you get right down to it...

Most importantly: We have to do our own security, because they *can’t*. Said that to James Kalstrom once during questions from the floor at an MIT thing for one of Whit Diffie’s books.
Kinda said his job was obsolete. Also thanked Dr. Diffie for inventing my business. Glares from both of them, for some reason.
It’s actually on C-SPAN, or so an also shocked relative told me later. :-)
This was before 9/11, of course, before I became a raving “kill the bastards” nationalist. Discovered my inner Andy Jackson, I did. :-). Which I still am, even though gov.us is actually anti-american, now.
Now, not only can they *not* provide for our security, which is what we hired them to do, they *won’t*. In fact, they are literally *attacking* everyone.
They’re now back to being on the outside of the tent, pissing in again. Which sucks.

@_subject: Obituary: Hal Finney | The Economist 
Hal Finney
AS IT turned out, Hal Finney was not Satoshi Nakamoto. But for a short while, at least, some people thought he might be. “Satoshi Nakamoto” is the most famous non-person on the internet. The name is a pseudonym, meant to hide the shadowy programmer (or programmers) behind Bitcoin, a computerised currency designed to liberate money from the control of any central bank. Speculating about his true identity is a popular pastime in some of the more esoteric corners of the web.
Still, Mr Finney was a good guess. As a cryptographer and a programmer he had the skills, for Bitcoin relies on cryptography to function. Having been an early adopter (he was, with the fabled Mr Nakamoto, a partner in the world’s first ever Bitcoin transaction) he certainly had the pedigree. And he had the beliefs, too. He was one of the original “cypherpunks”, a small, influential band of cryptographers, philosophers and programmers who, in the early 1990s, helped stamp the early internet with its culture of rebelliousness, distrust of government and optimistic belief in the liberating power of technology.
Two decades before Edward Snowden put the subject on front pages the world over, the cypherpunks were discussing how the coming age of the internet would allow governments and companies to pry ever more deeply and easily into the lives of their citizens and customers. But that same computer revolution would also hand ordinary people the power to fight back against the organisations that presumed to run their lives. Until that point, good quality encryption had been something available only to spy agencies and big companies. Computers would give people the power to carve out a mathematically guaranteed refuge from the powers that be, and to have a conversation that was provably, reliably private.
For Mr Finney, who had spent his high-school years imbibing the supercharged libertarianism of Ayn Rand, and who was now earning a living writing video games, that was a heady challenge. He accepted it with gusto. “Here we are faced with the problems of loss of privacy, creeping computerisation, massive databases, more centralisation,” he wrote. “[But] the computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people, rather than to control them.” His aim was clear: “The work we are doing here, broadly speaking, is dedicated to this goal of making Big Brother obsolete.”
He began helping, unpaid, with a program called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), putting in enough hours that it became a second job. It was well-named: even today, messages scrambled with it are thought to be unbreakable (Mr Snowden used PGP for his e-mail exchanges with the journalists to whom he leaked his documents). In 1991 Phil Zimmermann, PGP’s chief developer, uploaded it to the internet. America’s spies were aghast. Exporting encryption—which was classed as a weapon—was illegal. And here a group of self-proclaimed techno-liberators were proposing to just hand it over to anyone in the world—diplomat, criminal, teenager—who wanted it. When the legal kerfuffle died down, Mr Zimmermann hired Mr Finney as his new company’s second-ever employee.
Suspended animation
For a long time he ran a free “remailer”, a server designed to forward e-mail anonymously, no questions asked, to anyone in the world. Whose business was it, after all, what people wanted to send to each other, except the sender and the recipient? His interests extended beyond privacy. He was fascinated by the sorts of futures that technology might unlock, speculating about everything from how morals evolve in rich societies to when clean energy might finally displace fossil fuels. Away from the screen, he was chatty and gregarious, a keen skier and runner.
He had to stop in 2009, when he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND). The illness gradually paralyses its victims, but, with characteristic logic, Mr Finney pointed out that it was not a death sentence—even when those muscles necessary for breathing gave out, life could carry on with the aid of a mechanical ventilator. He was surprised, he said, to discover that most people with the disease “chose” death instead. After all, MND robs sufferers only of their bodies, not their minds, and for him it was the mind that mattered. His interests went beyond computers and coding, to sociology, psychology and how technology might improve society. As long as there was a way to communicate with the outside world—even if it was only by having a computer interpret the twitchings of a facial muscle—he wanted to endure.
When even that became difficult, he put a final plan into action. In accordance with his wishes, he was disconnected from his ventilator. As soon as he had been declared legally dead, technicians from a firm called Alcor froze his body in liquid nitrogen. He became one of a few hundred people who have elected to have their bodies stored until medicine advances to the point where it can safely revive them and cure their original ailments. It sounds (and is) science-fictional, and Mr Finney was under no illusions about the prospects of waking up again. But placing his faith in a technology that has yet to be invented was a rational gamble for a committed techno-optimist. And besides, a slim hope is better than none at all.

Until that point, good quality encryption had been something available only to spy agencies and big companies. Computers would give people the power to carve out a mathematically guaranteed refuge from the powers that be, and to have a conversation that was provably, reliably private.
For Mr Finney, who had spent his high-school years imbibing the supercharged libertarianism of Ayn Rand, and who was now earning a living writing video games, that was a heady challenge. He accepted it with gusto. “Here we are faced with the problems of loss of privacy, creeping computerisation, massive databases, more centralisation,” he wrote. “[But] the computer can be used as a tool to liberate and protect people, rather than to control them.” His aim was clear: “The work we are doing here, broadly speaking, is dedicated to this goal of making Big Brother obsolete.”
He began helping, unpaid, with a program called Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), putting in enough hours that it became a second job. It was well-named: even today, messages scrambled with it are thought to be unbreakable (Mr Snowden used PGP for his e-mail exchanges with the journalists to whom he leaked his documents). In 1991 Phil Zimmermann, PGP’s chief developer, uploaded it to the internet. America’s spies were aghast. Exporting encryption—which was classed as a weapon—was illegal. And here a group of self-proclaimed techno-liberators were proposing to just hand it over to anyone in the world—diplomat, criminal, teenager—who wanted it. When the legal kerfuffle died down, Mr Zimmermann hired Mr Finney as his new company’s second-ever employee.
Suspended animation
For a long time he ran a free “remailer”, a server designed to forward e-mail anonymously, no questions asked, to anyone in the world. Whose business was it, after all, what people wanted to send to each other, except the sender and the recipient? His interests extended beyond privacy. He was fascinated by the sorts of futures that technology might unlock, speculating about everything from how morals evolve in rich societies to when clean energy might finally displace fossil fuels. Away from the screen, he was chatty and gregarious, a keen skier and runner.
He had to stop in 2009, when he was diagnosed with motor neurone disease (MND). The illness gradually paralyses its victims, but, with characteristic logic, Mr Finney pointed out that it was not a death sentence—even when those muscles necessary for breathing gave out, life could carry on with the aid of a mechanical ventilator. He was surprised, he said, to discover that most people with the disease “chose” death instead. After all, MND robs sufferers only of their bodies, not their minds, and for him it was the mind that mattered. His interests went beyond computers and coding, to sociology, psychology and how technology might improve society. As long as there was a way to communicate with the outside world—even if it was only by having a computer interpret the twitchings of a facial muscle—he wanted to endure.
When even that became difficult, he put a final plan into action. In accordance with his wishes, he was disconnected from his ventilator. As soon as he had been declared legally dead, technicians from a firm called Alcor froze his body in liquid nitrogen. He became one of a few hundred people who have elected to have their bodies stored until medicine advances to the point where it can safely revive them and cure their original ailments. It sounds (and is) science-fictional, and Mr Finney was under no illusions about the prospects of waking up again. But placing his faith in a technology that has yet to be invented was a rational gamble for a committed techno-optimist. And besides, a slim hope is better than none at all.

In times like these, it’s easy to be paranoid.
Concerned by reports of hacking, data breaches and government spying, companies and consumers are looking for better ways to protect their data. Many are turning to encryption, a method of encoding messages that goes back millennia. Encryption is commonly used to secure online banking sessions and to protect credit-card data. But for the average computer user, it remains a mystery.
Here’s a brief guide to help readers unlock its secrets.
How does encryption work?
If you saw the recent movie “The Imitation Game,” you’ve seen a rudimentary, by modern standards, form of encryption. During World War II, the Germans used a machine to turn military messages into coded strings of symbols. These days, computers running complex mathematical formulas can do the same thing much faster, and the codes are much harder to crack.
What’s it used for?
If you’ve ever done banking online, you may have noticed a “lock” icon in the address bar, or that the bar turned green. That means the browser session is encrypted by your bank.
Consumers can download a growing crop of encryption tools for texting, browsing sessions and video and phone calls. Users usually must download an app or install software that scrambles messages as they are sent. (The recipient needs to be using the same app or software to unscramble the message.)
Apple has started encrypting personal data on its latest mobile operating system, iOS 8. This means an outsider who hacks into a device or into Apple’s servers would see a string of unreadable characters instead of actual messages or FaceTime videos.
Can I encrypt email messages?
Yes, but it’s tricky. Sender and receiver must use the same type of encryption. If you have encryption switched on, but the friend you’re emailing doesn’t have it, he or she won’t be able to read your message.
Since the revelations of former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden about electronic eavesdropping by the NSA, big tech companies have made moves to add encryption. Yahoo Inc. and Google Inc. both have announced plans to begin encrypting emails of users of their services, but the projects are moving slowly.
Can encryption really protect me from getting hacked?
Maybe. If a hacker obtains the encryption keys, or the formula that unlocks the code, all that encrypting was for naught. And that happens all the time in corporate data breaches, says Avivah Litan, a vice president and senior analyst focusing on security issues at market-research firm Gartner Inc. For example, as part of the 2007 breach at TJX Cos., hackers stole a TJX point-of-sale card-reader system and brought it home. The hackers were able to break the code used to encrypt card transactions and stole data from tens of millions of customer accounts.
How can I get started?
In addition to Apple’s built-in encryption in its new mobile devices, Android users can download WhatsApp, which encrypts text messages. WhatsApp, a company owned by Facebook Inc., says it is working on offering encryption for all communication sent between WhatsApp users, including images, audio and text.
A number of vendors—including Voltage Security Inc., Protegrity and RSA Security, a unit of EMC Corp. —offer encryption of corporate data, including email and credit-card records. Silent Circle’s Blackphone is a phone for corporate users that can send encrypted voice calls, text, emails and other data—if both parties are using a Blackphone.
Why isn’t everything encrypted? There are plenty of reasons. Encryption is time-consuming and difficult to implement. It’s hard to properly manage who has access to encryption keys, and it slows system performance.

ObPedantry: Anselm was not an Arab, his reductive "proof of god" as “perfect" parlor trick notwithstanding.
There were *no* Arab philosophers, much less "really smart" ones. Avicenna, for instance, was Persian, and like most Arab-conquered middle eastern types by then, regurgitated earlier Greek text using Indian astronomy math, including the zero, finance, (the foreign exchange contract, the letter of credit, and the demand-deposit check, say), and science. A bare fraction of which was actually “saved” by rampaging Islamic Arab rapine, physical, intellectual, and otherwise. There were *copies*, even better ones, of the contents of the Library at Alexandria, all over the ancient middle east, and even after it was burned by both Ceasar and a Bishop or two, it was the Muslims who actually burned its entire contents. And all the other libraries besides.
Averroes, another leading “Arab” philosophical light, was a Spaniard. And an Aristotelian. So no new philosophy there, either. All of Arab “contributions” to “civilization” were derivative. The lateen sail was Roman (“Lateen”, geddit?), for instance. Damascus steel was Indian wootz steel.
The Arabs' principal accomplishment, if you can call it that, was destroying the ancient world wherever they went, and replacing it with abject barbarism for most of a thousand years. Their piracy in the Mediterranean killed trade between east and west, (and north and south) for the entirety of their command of it and was the proximal cause of the Dark Ages in the West. Their contribution to philosophy, if one could call it that, was to declare, after they got sick of listening to Persians and Egyptians prattle badly-regurgitated Greek for a century or so, that *nothing* happens without god’s will, which obviated the need for cause and effect at all. You struck two stones together, and god *decided* that there would be a spark, you see. Which is how the world got blessed with Sharia “law” and all the rest of Islam’s barbaric world view.
As long as there can be nothing unless God wills it, there can be no Islamic science. At least the Orthodox and the Catholics had to somehow incorporate cause and effect into their view of the world, or there would not be any sin. Seeding their own intellectual demise, at least, at the hands of the scientific method later on.
In the west, philosophy was made the “handmaiden” of theology for more than fifteen hundred years. For a thousand of those years, philosophy in Islam was a shit-house slave.
Philosophy didn’t actually occur in the west until Newton figured out how to use mathematics to deal with infinity in order to calculate the motion of objects. Discovered *again*, apparently. Palimpsests have been recovered from Orthodox codices made of scraped-over scrolls containing Archimedes (who else? :-)), dealing in infinitesimals, at least, if not the actual epsilons and deltas which finally nailed calculus to mathematical terra-firma by Bolzano in 1817. After Newton, a veritable festival of philosophical navel-gazing began in the West after, with the possible exception of the Stoics and Cynics, almost two thousand years. All to collapse again after Godel proved he was his own grandpa. Or, at least, he *could*, Groucho, belong to a club that would have him as a member.
And, of course, Existentialism, like Freudianism, is merely literature. Okay. Freudianism is really *bad* literature, with Freud conflating Oedipus with Hamlet. Besides, being, you know, proven to be unfalsifiable pseudoscience, in the same breath that Karl Popper took it out with Marxism in the 1950’s. Existentialism isn’t even that. It’s another example of Eric Raymond’s "Gramscian Damage”: .

Right. And nothing is new. I cite *novel* stuff in every occurrence, outlining actual human *progress*, and you go all relativistic and say they’re derivative. Fine. Derivative of what, exactly? What was the Roman lateen sail derivative of if there had not been a triangular sail before, for instance.
What is Zeno’s paradox, say, derivative of? The Pythagorean theorem? Hero’s steam turbine?
There *is* an arrow to progress. It is measurable. The arrow of islamic culture points in completely the opposite direction. The left’s anti-western urge to annihilate progress, and thus humanity, is striking in its tenacity.

Information that is only valuable because of book-entry transaction settlement, by the way. Like, say, (for the current generation of ancom cypherpunks, who don’t know commerce from the dictatorship of the proletariat) checks, credit cards, and, yes, bitcoin. The blockchain is merely :-) a cryptographically secure inviolate public ledger, remember. It may be possible to hide transactions there, but I wouldn’t bet my life on it.
Because we *need* biometricly-provable is-a-physical-person and-then-you-go-to-jail-if-you-lie identity in order for transactions to even execute, much clear and settle, we’ve created an entire industry based on the leftover information exhaust, dovetailing nicely with our former practice of massive industrial production runs of exactly identical goods, and thus the transfer-pricing of ostensibly marketable (as in free exchange, not as in advertising) assets, now migrated to the internet with a vengeance, to be used as evidence against us in a court of law, Arlo.
Instantaneously-settled transactions, like, say, with blind signatures, which, not coincidentally, required no counterparty identity to function, only a linked list of expired certificates, only readable at the time of double spending, is why I joined the original cypherpunks list to begin with. In 1994. We’ve been at this a long time. At the time, I had digital good that I could email to someone, like say, Oak Ridge Labs, but they could only send me a paper purchase order by return mail. Which I then had to reply to that purchase order, by mail, with a paper invoice, which they would then send me a paper check, also in the mail, which would then clear. Within five business days. Usually.
So now we’re learning, in increasingly intimate detail, something I first observed in public at the last Financial Cryptography Conference I went to, almost ten years ago: the closer you get to T-0 transaction settlement you get, the more dangerous identity-based finance becomes.
And that’s also why I still say that financial cryptography is the only cryptography that matters.

The Register
GNU cryptocurrency aims at 'the mainstream economy not the black market'
GNU and an outfit called “Inria” have released Alpha code – version 0.0.0 to be precise – of an anonymous-but-taxable electronic payments system they say is “a currency for the mainstream economy, and not the black market.”
“Taler”, as the effort is dubbed, looks to be an attempt to build on the concepts behind Bitcoin. So while Taler lets you use encrypted “coins” as a means of exchange, it is explicitly not a new currency. Instead, it “... uses an electronic exchange holding financial reserves in existing currencies.”
“This means that Taler is not a new currency with the inherent currency fluctuation risks, but instead the cryptographic coins correspond to existing currencies, such as US Dollars, Euros or even BitCoins.”
The technology is also designed to be open enough that governments can peer inside, levy “sales, value-added or income taxes”.
As a GNU project, the code is of course freely-available.
For now, the effort is in its very early stages. GNU even warns, in the announcement of the project's debut, that “There is no auditor, and hence components do not properly support auditors either. As a result, a dishonest exchange could embezzle funds.” There's also no real-world integration at present, “so only toy currencies are available for now.”
If you're interested regardless of those foibles, the 0.0.0 code does include “key components providing logic for running a bank, exchange, merchant and wallet.” That code is described as follows:
Inria and GNU hope to have more advanced versions of Taler to share by year's end.
When they do, it may well be game on in the cryptocurrency space: Taler's already used fighting words with its “mainstream, not black market” talk. Bitcoin's many admirers may take offence at that kind of language and point to strong adoption. Sceptics can point to security woes among Bitcoin exchanges, governance woes and the cryptocurrency's volatility as evidence that different approaches to electronic currencies probably won't hurt their evolution. ®

@_subject: The threat of privacy  
The Threat of Privacy By Charles M. Kahn1
Like artists, we academics want to believe that if one of our works doesn’t get enough attention it’s because we’re ahead of our time. I’d like to pretend that everything I’ve written is pathbreaking, and will eventually be recognized for its true importance. But I have to admit that there are really only a couple of cases where I can say with hindsight that something I wrote has been ahead of its time.
One of them2 is a paper written with Jamie McAndrews and Will Roberds, published in 2005, and titled “Money is Privacy.” We wrote it partly as a response to Narayana Kocherlakota’s famous paper “Money is Memory,” which could be taken as arguing that cash is essentially a record‐keeping device, tracking who was a net creditor and who a net debtor to society with respect to resources provided or consumed. The implication was that if it became easy to keep credit records directly, cash could wither away.
In our paper we argued instead that a key role of cash was its ability to protect the purchaser’s identity. So we predicted that, even while the reductions in costs of record keeping and increases in the speed of data transmission were expanding the usage of credit‐ and deposit‐account‐ based payments arrangements, cash would survive. Because the desire for privacy would always generate demand for cash, it would be a mistake—and ultimately futile—to attempt to abolish it. At the time, people were attuned to many of the problems of privacy, but there had not yet been a clear recognized link between the value of privacy and the role of payments systems. (Remember, bitcoin was only released in 2009).

Abolish CIA & FISA How to defend the Republic against the Deep State.
Angelo Codevilla
This is the first in The American Mind’s new Rethinking Policy series. Throughout 2020 we are publishing essays that boldly reframe, reorder, and reprioritize our political goals in order to directly address the real challenges of our time. These essays are intended to spur clear, sharp discussions that rid us of obsolete ideological frameworks and point towards viable paths forward. Amid today’s realignment, we must discern and articulate vital principles and national purpose free of the ideological encumbrances of the past. —Eds.
America’s Intelligence agencies are the deep state’s deepest part, and the most immediate threat to representative government. They are also not very good at what they are supposed to be doing. Protecting the Republic from them requires refocusing them on their proper jobs.
Intelligence officials abuse their positions to discredit opposition to the Democratic Party, of which they are part. Complicit with the media, they leverage the public’s mistaken faith in their superior knowledge, competence, and patriotism to vilify their domestic enemies from behind secrecy’s shield.
Pretenses of superior knowledge have always tempted the Administrative State’s officials to manipulate or override voters. Hence, as Justice Robert H. Jackson (who served as chief prosecutor of the Nuremberg trials) warned, they often turn their powers against whomever they dislike politically, socially, or personally and try to minimize the public’s access to the bases upon which they act.
But only the Intelligence agencies have the power to do that while claiming that scrutiny of their pretenses endangers national security. They have succeeded in restricting information about their misdeeds by “classifying” them under the Espionage Act of 1921. Thus covered, they misrepresent their opinions as knowledge and their preferences as logic. Thus acting as irresponsible arbiters of truth at the highest levels of American public life, they are the foremost jaws of the ruling class vise that is squeezing self-rule out of America.
As Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) truly told President Trump, “Let me tell you, you take on the intelligence community, they have six ways from Sunday at getting back at you.” As we shall see, Intelligence officials have proved Schumer correct.
What follows begins with an overview of the threats today’s intelligence agencies pose to self-government in America.
Next, it touches on U.S. intelligence’s dismal professional record, and suggests that the measures needed to refocus them on professional performance would also separate them from domestic politics.
In sum, we find:
Finally, we outline the steps that presidents and Congress might take to improve matters:
Sword and Shield
Roughly one third of the U.S government’s $80 billion annual budget for intelligence is devoted to the military’s “Intelligence-Related Activities.” These are technical programs to surveil military targets and connect the information to weapons. Generally speaking, their focus ensures their usefulness. Professional and political dysfunction, however, are rife in the other two thirds, the “National Intelligence Program.” This is our subject.
Intelligence is an instrument of conflict. It is knowledge (or pretense thereof) that can help one force or team at the expense of another. But the gathering and management of secret information naturally tempts those in charge of it to marshal truths or lies to hurt competitors within their own side as well. That is why prudent statesmen have curbed such temptations by subordinating Intelligence to government operations that deal with foreigners.
By nature, Intelligence is not independent. It is a function defined by the operations it serves. That is why wise statesmen have considered Intelligence agencies that are un-tied to specific operational concerns to be inherently dangerous, as well as not so useful in foreign and military affairs. When the U.S. established CIA as an agency responsible only to the president, it broke new ground. Nothing concerned the authors of the 1947 National Security Act that established it so much as preventing it from interfering in domestic matters.
Yet, ab initio, CIA’s founding generation concerned itself with making national policy, arguably more than with anything else, and transmitted that concern to its successors. Today’s meddling in elections and trying to overturn their results is a logical consequence.
Police Intelligence is analogous. Statesmen manage its temptations by keeping it focused on crimes defined by law. Until the 1960s, the FBI’s focus on investigating violations of statutes, and the “cop mentality” with which it dealt with national security issues, limited its interference in politics to gathering bits of dirt on politicians. By the 1970s, however, the FBI was joining CIA in supporting the causes and prejudices of its political homologues.
Today these Agencies’ naked threat to the president of the United States, conveyed by the opposition party’s leader, shows a power grab so big that, unless crushed, it puts them on the path trod by the Roman Empire’s Praetorian guard. Like the Roman Emperor’s supposed guardians, they claim to protect the City. But, as Attorney General William Barr noted, they have come to identify “the national interest with their own political preferences,” feeling that “anyone who has a different opinion” is somehow “an enemy of the state.” They now support their party in seizing power, “[convincing] themselves that what they’re doing is in the higher interest, the better good.”
In short, CIA and FBI have become instruments of partisan power.
None of this, of course, has anything to do with the natural, proper functions of Intelligence.
The Soviet Cheka (KGB), the Nazi Gestsapo, the Chinese Communists’ Intelligence service (which they called “the teeth of the dragon”) as well as their contemporary epigones, are not about knowledge—not even about discovering who the regime’s enemies are. They are weapons—what the Soviets called the Party’s “sword and shield,” made to hurt whomever the Party designates as enemies. Because the power to hurt people unaccountably is tyranny’s quintessential tool, competent tyrants limit such agencies’ powers by periodically purging them.
Power in America
Although a growing amount of the U.S. Intelligence agencies’ power comes from the kind of identification with the ruling party and class that is characteristic of totalitarian regimes—media, judiciary, etc.—in America it is ultimately founded on the public’s, especially the conservative sector thereof’s, acceptance of them as expert, impartial, brave public servants.
Changing that perception is prerequisite to any and all reform.
The U.S. Intelligence agencies’ record shows that they are the opposite: professionally incompetent and politically dysfunctional. That record’s exposure, demystifying Intelligence, would make it possible to return the Agencies to their natural, proper functions.
To firmly subordinate foreign Intelligence to military and diplomatic operations we must disestablish CIA and return its functions to the Departments of State, Defense, and Treasury. Since the FBI’s involvement in politics—and especially its justification thereof—also follows to some extent from its involvement in foreign affairs via anti-terrorism, re-establishing the distinction between Intelligence and law enforcement is essential. We must also repeal some of the laws and regulations that lately have empowered the Agencies’ misbehavior, notably the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
All this is now possible because, in recent years, the Agencies’ behavior has raised opposition on the political Right as well as on the Left.
Professional Dysfunction
CIA never did and never could fulfill the expectations placed on it.
Nothing could be farther from the truth than the supposition that its agents penetrate the world and have access to its secrets. 98% of CIA “case officers” are under “official cover,”—mostly pretending to be diplomats. Hence, they are known as collectors of information for the U.S. government, and are limited to the social circles of U.S. government employees. The other 2% pretend to be working for U.S. companies.
Studies of cables from CIA stations show that the persons these officers claim as “agents” are no such thing, and that their “take” is inferior in quality to that of U.S. diplomats. Most important, these so-called agent networks are not protected by anything that respectable professionals would call “counterintelligence,” i.e., quality control. So eager is CIA for anything that looks like agent information that it takes literally anything that looks like agent information and calls it good.
Often, what it gets is deadly disinformation. Consider: In December 2009, an “agent” walked into a meeting of CIA case officers and blew everyone to kingdom come. For the previous year and a half, CIA had relied on this agent’s information to order drone strikes killing God knows how many people whom he had falsely fingered as America’s enemies.
CIA’s analytical acumen is worse than carelessness. So much does CIA concentrate on spinning information to serve its own policy preferences that it cares little for accuracy. The higher up the chain any of its products go, the less fact and the more spin they contain. I once attended one of its top-secret, codeword-protected briefings on the Iran-Iraq war, in which the briefers referred to a map of the region which mis-labeled Iraq and Syria. As usual, the facts were window dressing for the spin.
CIA jealously guards its prerogative to well-nigh monopolize the flow of Intelligence to the president, Congress, and (via leaks) the public. It sets the subjects of and has the final word on single “national Intelligence estimates” (NIEs)—official versions of foreign realities. Seasoned observers can safely bet that these will come at a time and be written in a manner to bolster the Democratic party’s position on pending foreign policy questions. Reality be damned.
Between 1963 and 1978 annual NIEs on Soviet strategic forces stated that the Soviets would not try to match U.S. missiles’ numbers. When they matched them, the NIEs stated that they would not exceed them substantially. When they exceeded them substantially, the NIEs said that they would not equip them for counterforce warfare. When they so equipped them, the NIEs said that this did not matter.
As the U.S. government debated what to do about Iran’s nuclear program, CIA promulgated a special NIE that said that Iran had given up work on nuclear weapons. The team specially selected to write it were persons with a history of advocating leniency to Iran. Nor is this bias new: In 1950, CIA weighed in against General Douglas MacArthur on Korea policy both within the U.S. government and by supplying material for columns against his views by the New York Times’s James Reston.
The CIA’s bias is not mere incompetence. For more than a decade—during which, thanks to the treason of its own Aldrich Ames, the entire U.S. agent network in Moscow was under KGB control—CIA analysts still passed the “take” from that network to the president because, according to the Inspector General’s report, the analysts thought that the president should be acting as if these reports were true.
This is the same CIA that insisted for years that the GDP of East Germany—where whole families used to have to share a single tea bag and bananas were luxuries—was equal to that of West Germany, and that the Soviet Union’s ratio of military spending to GDP was the same as America’s. It was at least five times ours.
All of this is to say that, as regards strategic intelligence, CIA is usually worse than useless. For tactical intelligence, it is largely irrelevant. Intercepts of foreign communications are the one most useful source of tactical intelligence. NSA and the military do that. CIA often gets in the way of the military’s own needs for intelligence. Over the years, CIA has successfully lobbied Congress to prevent the military services from developing their own human collection networks, despite the fact that CIA’s own human assets are almost completely irrelevant to military needs.
Probably the only good result of the “war on terror” has been the Army’s and Marines’ forced resumption of responsibility for their own Intelligence, although restricted to the places where they must fight. The military services were always better equipped for human Intelligence because their officers—but especially their enlisted—are far more diverse racially, more versatile linguistically, and incomparably more accepting of personal risk than CIA’s case officers. The disparity is such that, in the early 2000s, CIA simply took over Army personnel, individually and as units, and used them for infiltrations of various kinds that its own people could not do and would not risk.
What, then, is CIA good for?
Its founding myth combines a historical falsehood with reference to technical circumstances that have not existed for at least a generation.
In 1947 and since, CIA’s advocates have argued that the surprise of Pearl Harbor happened because—although the information to indicate that Japan would attack Hawaii at 7am on December 7 existed in many pieces—no agency existed to put them together, to “connect the dots.” Had a place of central analysis existed, the disaster would have been avoided. Nonsense.
Our Navy had broken the Japanese diplomatic code and, from a succession of Tokyo’s messages to its Washington embassy, had concluded that the attack would happen in the place and at the time when it did. The Navy warned the White House and the War Department in time. But the latter’s warning to Pearl Harbor was sent by routine, and sat in Admiral Kimmel’s mailbox as the attack took place.
The truth that analysis of Intelligence must include a multiplicity of sources, and that a central repository of information is needed for that, was always the strongest argument for the existence of some sort of central facility where “all source analysis” could be done. But, since at least the 1980s, computers have made it possible and imperative for all analysts, regardless of their location, to access everything securely. Nowadays, ironically, CIA’s insistence on managing the access and distribution of information is the biggest barrier to universal, all-source Intelligence analysis.
Today, CIA is good for confidential meetings with the New York Times, theWashington Post, NBC News, etc., through which it joins—if it does not lead—campaigns to shape domestic American opinion.
What is the FBI good for?
Once upon a time, FBI foreign counterintelligence officers were cops first. Like all good cops, they knew the difference between the people on whose behalf they worked, and those who threaten them. They had graduated from places like Fordham, a Catholic, blue-collar university in the Bronx. Like T.V.’s Sergeant Joe Friday, they wore white shirts and said yes, sir, yes, ma’am. Unlike CIA case officers, FBI officers mixed with the kinds of people they investigated, and often went undercover themselves. The FBI jailed Capone and dismantled the Mafia. Because it used to take counterintelligence seriously, it was able to neutralize Soviet subversion in the USA. The old joke was that, in any meeting of the U.S. Communist Party or of its front groups, a majority of attendees were FBI agents. The only U.S. Intelligence penetration of the Kremlin was the FBI’s recruitment of a U.S. labor activist whom high-level Soviets trusted.
In the late 1970s, that began to change. Director William Webster (1978-87) refused to back up the officers who had infiltrated and surveilled the New Left’s collaboration with the Soviets against America in the Vietnam War. Webster also introduced contemporary political correctness into the FBI. Asked by the Senate Intelligence Committee why his FBI had neither infiltrated nor disrupted the Jim Jones cult that resulted in the deaths of 900 Americans in Jonestown, Guyana, he answered that he would no more have interfered with that religion than with the Catholic Church. Not incidentally, the Jim Jones cult was associated with the Democratic party.
Thus FBI officers became standard bureaucrats who learned to operate on the assumption that all Americans were equally likely as not to be proper targets of investigation. They replaced the distinctions by which they had previously operated with the classic bureaucratic imperative: look out for yourselves by making sure to please the powerful.
Webster’s FBI joined the ACLU as the principal sponsor of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which judicially pre-cleared all electronic surveillance operations through ex parte secret proceedings, despite warnings that such pre-clearance amounts to warrants for warrantless surveillance, and hence that it incentivizes political abuse.
The directorships of William Sessions and Louis Freeh, ending in 2001, did nothing to slow the FBI’s evolution along these lines. Reliance on pseudo-scientific “profiling” vastly reduced the felt need for scruples.
Thus did the Bureau practically convict an innocent man, Richard Jewell, of having bombed the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
From the beginning, the FBI’s “profiling” process concluded that no foreign government or entity had been responsible for the dispatch of letters from a post office near where the 9/11 hijackers had lived containing weapons-grade anthrax. Rather, they claimed the attacks that killed five and injured 17 Americans had been the work of a lone, white, conservative scientist.
Thus it pursued and nearly broke one Steven Hatfill, whose lawsuit the government subsequently settled for $5.8 million. The FBI then turned its attention to someone else who fit its profile, Bruce Edward Ivins, whom it never charged but whom it ruined and hounded into suicide. After which it declared him guilty, but refused to make public the evidence on which it had reached its conclusion. Classified, you know? No one was ever charged with the crime. This matter defined Robert Mueller’s (2001-13) directorship.
The Bureau’s increasing adoption of military weapons and tactics further tempted its officials to shortcut intelligence for the sake of, well, war against disfavored persons and movements. In 1992 the Bureau conducted an 11-day war against the Randy Weaver family in a remote Idaho cabin, in which one law enforcement officer was killed along with the Weavers’ 14-year-old son, and which ended with an FBI sniper killing Mrs. Weaver with baby in arms—and with an angry jury acquitting Weaver. A year later, the FBI ran another war against a religious cult in Texas that cost four lives.
And, oh yes, the FBI has protected America against such dangerous characters as Martha Stewart, Lewis Libby, and General Michael Flynn, by perfecting the technique of “perjury trapping” (accusing someone of perjury by contrasting the target’s recollections with someone else’s) whoever is foolish enough to speak with its Special Agents.
Thus did the FBI become the politically weaponized, domestic danger it is today.
Political Dysfunction
The Intelligence agencies were the key element of the ruling class’s support of the Democratic Party in the 2016 election. Its senior officers, regarding themselves as guardians of their class’s right to rule, waged war on Trump’s candidacy.
There being no facts on which to base charges of Trump’s illegitimacy in office, the Agencies strove instead to create “predicates” for investigations, the very existence of which would substitute for facts and provide the bases for media accounts of Trump’s villainy. Since Trump was elected, the Agencies have been the indispensable element of the ruling class’s “resistance.” Through the media, they have defamed him using their hoary ploy: You must believe us because what we say is based on classified information. For that reason, your demand for corroboration threatens National Security.
CIA was first and foremost. Circa April 2016, it “vectored” some of its longstanding assets, including Stefan Halper in Britain and Joseph Mifsud in Italy, to approach low-level Trump advisers Carter Page and George Papadopoulos, respectively. Note: these agents were not seeking information. The meetings they initiated served as the factual bases for the outright lie that these advisers, and hence Trump, were involved in obtaining information from Russia to smear Hillary Clinton. This is the “narrative” that CIA conveyed to the media, whose renditions thereof would serve as a “predicate” (i.e. as a watered-down substitute for “probable cause) to begin a formal investigation that would lead to more stories and lend further public force to the “narrative”: Trump as a Russian agent.
That narrative having taken root in the media by the summer of 2016, the Agencies initiated a formal counterintelligence investigation of the Trump campaign, along with a criminal investigation of him. This involved authorization to conduct electronic surveillance of the campaign and of him. But by this time, Intelligence surveillance of Trump had already been going on for months under Sec. 702 of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Using this legal vehicle, Trump had been the real target though the surveillance was aimed nominally at the Russians. This is what Admiral Mike Rogers, head of the National Security Agency, told the president-elect on November 16, 2016, that caused him to move his transition headquarters to his NJ golf club.
It is essential to note that well before Trump was elected the extensive surveillance to which his campaign had been subjected had proved to U.S. Intelligence that neither he nor his had ever dealt with the Russians in any way about the election. None of the subsequent “investigations” have unearthed anything that the Agencies did not already know months before November 2016. Nevertheless, these “investigations,” based on the “narrative” that Trump had colluded, continued. They were not discovering facts. They were providing pretexts for accusations.
The supposition that the evidence exists in classified form remains the official excuse for the ruling class’s “resistance” to the Trump administration, and a feature of the Democrats’ impeachment of him. Obviously, such “investigations” by “Intelligence” are about acting as the “sword and shield” of the ruling party and of the class it represents by spreading political lies.
The Intelligence agencies’ bureaucratic/corporate interests also contributed to their war on Trump.
Trump’s primary foreign policy adviser during the campaign, Lieutenant General Michael Flynn, had been director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. Like other directors of DIA, he had developed antipathy for CIA, and supported plans for removing it from its paramount role in the Intelligence Community. As Trump’s prospective National Security adviser, he would have implemented those ideas. Flynn was also privy to the details of the Obama administration’s clandestine activities in Libya that had led to the embarrassing destruction of the U.S. mission there with the loss of four American lives.
Whatever damage could be done to Trump’s election prospects or eventual legitimacy, “getting” Flynn was a priority unto itself. On November 10, 2016, in a highly unusual act of interference with a successor, and almost certainly at CIA Director John Brennan’s suggestion, Obama warned Trump against hiring Flynn. On January 24, just after the inauguration, FBI agents interviewed Flynn about a wholly legitimate conversation with the Russian ambassador and, with the transcripts of the intercepts thereof in hand, led him into recollections of that conversation inconsistent with the transcript—on the basis of which he was charged with lying to a federal investigator, ruined financially, and forced to plead guilty to save his son from indictment.
The intelligence agencies’ hostility, and the black eye of Flynn’ s indictment, impacted the first round of Trump’s personnel choices and forced him to look over his shoulder.
No sooner had Trump begun appointing officials than the CIA began to effectively veto his choices by denying them security clearances—in the prototypical January 2017 case of NSC official Michael Townley, because he had been critical of the Agency. The FBI slow-walked investigations for security clearances.
No one disputes that any President has plenary authority to grant and remove clearances. But Trump chose to defer to the Agencies. Trump also deferred to the Agencies with regard to what documents are or are not legitimately classified, giving them free rein to “leak” their versions thereof to the news media and to retreat behind security classification’s shield.
Presidential policies are only words, unless implemented by people committed to them. But as a result of this deference to his enemies, three years into the Trump administration only a fourth of presidential positions have been filled and Trump hops on one leg instead of running on four. At this rate, the Trump administration is sure to end without ever really having existed—which is the idea.
In sum, it is difficult to overstate the effect of the intelligence agencies’ participation in the “resistance.” Why Trump has suffered their behavior is irrelevant.
FISA and Official Secrets
The 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act is not least among the incentives that have contributed to the U.S. Intelligence agencies’ professional and political dysfunction. One of the unintended consequences of secret judicial imprimaturs on investigations is that the FISA courts confer the status of official secrets on the results. At the same time, the U.S. government has been claiming that the Espionage Act demands that classified information be afforded something like the deference mandated by Britain’s Official Secrets Act. All this has empowered and emboldened bureaucrats.
By the late 1970s the intelligence bureaucracies—CIA, FBI, NSA—had become leery of conducting any electronic surveillance, even of Soviet Bloc embassies and persons, because some American leftists who had worked with said embassies against the U.S. in the Vietnam war had filed lawsuits against prominent individuals in these bureaucracies. Hence the agents clamored for judicial warrants to protect them from lawsuits in national security cases in the same way they are protected in cases of wiretaps for domestic criminal purposes.
Trouble was—and is—that to ask a judge for a warrant in any ordinary court is eventually to reveal the surveillance to the objects thereof. The bureaucracies asked Congress to square the circle by establishing a court to rule ex parte, secretly. But FISA, by providing judicial pre-authorization for many of our national security bureaucracies’ actions, is perverting the American legal system and fostering a secret body of common law hostile to civil liberties.
Prior to FISA, the intelligence bureaucracies’ actions, although unquestionable a priori because undertaken secretly, could always be questioned openly and thoroughly ex post facto. Once FISA became law however, the defense that any given act was good because it was lawful made substantive questioning far more difficult. It is also more difficult because the information’s classified status now enjoys judicial approval.
In 1978, the American Bar Association invited me to debate the issue with professor Antonin Scalia at the University of Chicago’s law school. I said that requiring judicial authorization for an executive action in pursuit of national security is an unconstitutional obstruction of the president’s power as commander-in-chief. Scalia agreed, but pointed out that the president, i.e., the bureaucracies, had agreed to support involving judges in national security because they realized that the obstruction is theoretical rather than practical: FISA’s secret court, having no basis for judging what is or is not required for national security, would merely give the Agencies the confidence to do their jobs. I countered that this very confidence would be problematic: although strictly speaking the court could confer only a procedural imprimatur, in practice that imprimatur would shield the bureaucracies—and the President—from having to defend the substantive value, and the propriety, of any act of surveillance.
I also pointed out that ex parte secrecy had been the defining feature of England’s infamous “Star Chamber”—the very negation of Anglo-Saxon due process. Scalia agreed, but pointed out that the FISA court’s jurisdiction would be very limited. I countered that Congress could expand that foreign body, and that it would expand in practice. Scalia said that we were debating only the law then proposed, as indeed we were.
But the law’s logic asserted itself. Already in the 1980s the Intelligence Committees were receiving requests to place authorization for FBI infiltration of domestic groups “of national security interest” within the FISA system. In 2001 Congress and the President enacted section 702, which effectively authorizes all manner of warrantless surveillance of Americans so long as it is excused as “incidental” to collection on foreigners.
FISA became law because the Intelligence Agencies’ (primarily FBI’s) concerns dovetailed with those of the sincere ACLU-variety liberals of that time. The liberals then believed that involving the judiciary in decisions to wiretap foreigners, and drafting guidelines severely to limit the retention and use of data collected incidentally about “U.S. persons,” would gradually extend the Fourth Amendment’s standards of “probable cause” plus warrants to foreign Intelligence. At the time, I warned fellow Senate staffer John Elliff and other liberal drafters agonizing over the rules’ minutiae that their words were not housebreaking Intelligence, but rather giving bureaucrats the means of covering political surveillance with a cloak of pretend legality—providing them with temptations they eventually could not resist. They were legalizing Watergate.
Watergate, recall, was an attempt by two of President Nixon’s staffers to gather information about the opposition party’s 1972 presidential campaign. That anyone connected with the U.S. government should use government resources to disadvantage a political opponent was scandalous. Barriers to investigating it were judged just as scandalous, and all involved in Watergate were punished severely.
As noted above, U.S. government Intelligence began electronic surveillance of Trump as soon as it became possible that he would be the Republican nominee. In the spring of 2016 it also infiltrated his campaign with its agents and instituted investigations—counterintelligence and criminal—soon thereafter. This was Watergate on a massive scale.
By October, the surveillance and investigations had turned up nothing that substantiated the notorious “Steele Dossier” that the media had been touting since summer. Never mind the charges that Trump was beholden to Russia—they failed to turn up anything that would derail Trump upon release. Hence, when it began to seem possible that Trump might win, the bureaucrats who had ordered the surveillance and investigations faced the possibility of having to explain by what right they had done it.
FISA was available for legal cover. In a nutshell: they re-packaged the Steele Dossier on which the public charges had been based and presented it to the FISA court, nominally to get a warrant for surveillance of low-level Trump adviser Carter Page and the rest of the campaign. They did this in late October—far too close to the election to obtain any information useful in that regard. The Agencies having surveiled Trump for seven months, the warrant served neither the gathering of information nor any offensive purpose.
Instead, through the Carter Page warrant, the FBI got the Court to warrant, by political implication, the surveillance that had begun in April under Section 702, as well as the counterintelligence/criminal investigation (initiated formally on July 31, but actually begun in April). FBI officials were able to do this because at least some of the federal judges who staff the FISA Court had become part of the same political party.
In 1972 nobody had to ask whether or not the president’s men who burglarized the DNC suite at the Watergate Hotel were committing the (only in America) high political crime of using government power against the opposition candidate. The only question was “what did the president know, and when did he know it?” Nor were there any legal obstacles to obtaining any documents or testimony regarding who had done what. Since a crime was involved, the courts struck down the president’s claim of executive privilege.
But in 2016, when the president’s men used the full power of the FBI and CIA to surveil and defeat the opposition candidate and then to de-legitimize the election’s winner, they were confident knowing they had acted with the FISA Court’s imprimatur, and that the bureaucratic machine—Inspectors General, etc.—would agree that that their request to the Court had been properly “predicated.” They turned out to be correct.
Since early 2017, as first a trickle and then a flood of evidence has become public that all four of the FISA court’s approvals of surveillance warrants were based essentially on political lies, no judge has hauled in any bureaucrat to face comeuppance for contempt of court. Nor have any judges complained of having been fooled. Only in 2020, after the Justice Department officially informed the FISA Court that at least two of the warrants it had issued were based on fraudulent presentations, did the Court acknowledge that these warrants had been issued invalidly.
Moreover, since the bureaucrats’ submissions to the Court were classified, the CIA, FBI, and Justice Department bureaucracies refused even Congress’s and the new president’s demands to see them, unredacted. Classified, you know?
But why give implicit respect to claims of classification?
Under the Espionage Act, Federal officers can classify the information they generate as “confidential” if, according to their judgment, its publication would “harm” the United States; as “secret” if they think the harm would be “serious”; and as “top secret” if they judges the prospective harm “especially serious.” Classification being merely the classifier’s opinion, publication or release of classified information is not a crime in America, unless it can be shown that it was harmful, and that the person either knew it would do harm or acted recklessly.
But now, because of ruling class solidarity and bureaucratic self-interest, a classified stamp increasingly endows documents with the status of Official Secrets, and the documents’ possessor with the authority to withhold them – while briefing the press on his version of them with impunity.
In sum, FISA’s judicial involvement in national security affairs made Watergate-type operations into lawful tools of government power. But also, by the logic of power and class solidarity, it has contributed to making the protection of security into a system that allows the well-connected to make accusations anonymously while making it impossible for those accused to fully defend themselves on substance. FISA has helped make National Security secrecy the last refuge of scoundrels.
Americans, ruling class included, share an interest in removing the Intelligence Agencies from domestic politics and refocusing them on their natural functions. Yes, they have served, and are serving now as the ruling class’s sword and shield. Yet this class’s members know that Praetorians’ natural tendency is to govern on their own account. Knowledge of Intelligence’s power to arbitrate intra-ruling class struggles is the reason why Stalin purged and killed KGB chief Nikolai Yezhov and Khrushchev did the same to Lavrentiy Beria, why Mao did it to Kang Sheng, and why Fidel Castro executed General Arnaldo Ochoa Sánchez on trumped-up charges.
Without switching allegiances, the Sword and Shield’s handlers can ruin their patrons merely by taking sides in their internecine quarrels. In fact, the U.S. Agencies’ outsized impact on the 2016 election and aftermath began when someone hacked into the DNC’s e-mails, the publication of which showcased that the Party hierarchy had taken Hillary Clinton’s side against insurgent Bernie Sanders. The FBI, by not pressing an investigation into who had done the hacking while espousing the baseless narrative that “the Russians” had done it to help Trump, helped avert intra-Democrat bloodletting while boosting Clinton. When the next internal clash comes, the Agencies could well decide the contest.
Here is a sketch of the major measures by which any president and Congress could help guard the Republic against the Agencies, in ascending order of importance and difficulty.
Repeal FISA
Were the executive branch to challenge FISA in court, it is difficult to imagine the argument by which to sustain the constitutionality of involving the Judiciary in national security surveillance.
Neither Professor Scalia nor anyone else made any such arguments in 1978. At the time, civil libertarians accepted in good faith the immunities that FISA was giving the Agencies in exchange for their good-faith promise to take seriously the parchment barriers contained in the law. The Justice Department winked at this accord’s patent un-constitutionality because it removed objections to needed surveillance of foreigners while posing no immediate threats. Hence, FISA became known as “an indispensable tool” for national security—as if needed surveillance had never been done before FISA and could not take place without it. But as the years wore on, good faith succumbed to partisanship, and tolerating little violations of the Constitution for noble purposes had its usual effects.
Today, there is no more good faith.
Today, FISA’s existence (and expansion under Section 702) having facilitated gross U.S. governmental interference in our political process, there is broad consensus on the need for “a legislative fix.” But because the problem lies in FISA’s very premise—the secret mingling of judicial and executive power—no such fix is possible. This being so, any legislative remedies—more elaborate standards and procedures, maybe even mandating a “devil’s advocate”—must be equally as vulnerable to partisan re-interpretation as the ones that John Elliff and friends elaborated in 1978. Parchment barriers notwithstanding, purpose-driven bureaucrats and friendly judges acting together in secret can do whatever they want.
With regard to Intelligence surveillance as with anything else, the Constitution makes it possible for the Judiciary to restrain the Executive by forcing each to work by their own rules. The Executive may work in secret. But the Judiciary may choose to examine that secret work in its own public sphere. The very possibility of a public hearing is greater incentive for the Executive to adhere to its own rules than submitting applications to an ex parte court in secret. Separation of powers—each branch concentrating on fulfilling its own responsibilities—is the U.S. Constitution’s genius.
Repealing FISA outright is as simple as the removal of a priori justification would be sobering. Minus FISA, the Agencies would find malfeasance more hazardous and more difficult to hide. Only Congress can repeal it. But the president can achieve the same effect by challenging FISA’s constitutionality in the Supreme Court, while ordering the Agencies not to submit any applications to the FISA Court. But changing the CIA’s and FBI’s habit of acting as partisan policymakers and, most recently, of throwing their weight around in domestic politics, will require reducing the Agencies’ size, resources, and pretenses.
The U.S. Intelligence community’s size—some $58 Billion annually for the National Intelligence Plan—ensures that those who administer it control a lot of careers, contracts, consultancies, and high-level contacts. That much money and power, added to the capacity to shield the basis of its pronouncements, comports prestige in spite of substantive incompetence.
Wasteful activity is the least of the problem. Much of what happens within Intelligence is counterproductive. Worse, the sense of power that comes from managing such big things—while having near-total control of how their own management is explained—accustoms its officials to a ruinous sense of entitlement to having their own way. As the Intelligence community has grown in size—nearly doubling since 9/11—it is becoming ever more a political force that pursues its own objectives.
Hence, shearing U.S. Intelligence—cutting down or out functions that are wasteful or dysfunctional—is an indispensable means to refocusing the Agencies on their proper functions. Shearing also creates opportunities for replacing the officials whom the bureaucracy had selected as its champions with ones chosen to do what they should while eschewing domestic politics. Nothing quite so focuses bureaucrats’ minds as the clear and present possibility of reductions in force.
This is truest regarding CIA, the Community’s most politicized part, which wields outsized influence in Washington and in the media. From the beginning, the Agency took on a peculiar socio-political character and gathered its personnel’s allegiance to itself rather than to the president—or to the United States. Legally, shearing CIA is the easiest of tasks because, by the law that established it, its employees may be hired, managed, and fired strictly at the president’s pleasure.
The candidates for shearing include major technical Intelligence programs that have become known to their targets, and which hence have become potential avenues of disinformation. Many of CIA’s human Intelligence operations should also be considered for shearing because of their structural operational insecurity. Since lack of operational security and quality control is arguably U.S. Intelligence’s major shortcoming, lack of these features in any given programs should put it on the chopping block.
The gargantuan amounts of metadata of U.S. telephone calls and emails have been judged useless and worse: the infrastructure for storing them should be eliminated.
Much if not most of the Community’s vast network of consultants has always been a kind of echo chamber and welfare system for the well-connected, and should be eliminated.
CIA’s Directorate of Intelligence, vastly overstaffed and specializing in groupthink, tries to be the U.S. government’s official interpreter of foreign reality—a worse than useless function. The Community’s very size has occasioned the establishment of support structures, such as the National Intelligence University, to prepare persons for service in it. Surely, these should be abolished.
Not least of the benefits from the cuts would come from explaining to the public how they remedy wrongs and improve performance. Such explanations would also temper the resistance they would generate.
Since the reduction and possible elimination of programs impacts the interests of well-connected officials—and especially of corporate contractors—resistance and lobbying are sure to be fierce. But the personal, private motivation of these factional interests can serve as an argument for why the cuts are in the national interest. Each cut should be made in ways that de-mystify Intelligence, and put it in its natural place as the servant rather than the master of government.
Getting It Right
The trope that knowledge of others’ secrets is prerequisite to understanding how we should deal with them is the reverse of the truth. In fact unless we know who we are and what’s good for us; unless ordinary intercourse has taught us what others are about; unless we use our intelligence in the ordinary sense of the word, secret Intelligence can only confuse us. And in fact, though the United States has never suffered because our officials lacked knowledge of others’ secrets, the American people have suffered much from their willful ignorance of the realities against which they continue to stub our toes.
All too often, they have used Intelligence to counter common sense. During the Cold War, arguments over secret tidbits about Soviet weapons allowed policymakers to sidestep the question before them: how shall we defend America? More recently, arguments about Iraq’s and Iran’s Weapons of Mass Destruction obscured the real question: what is our interest in the Middle East, and how shall we serve it?
Intelligence being policy’s natural servant, it cannot carry any policy’s burden. Intelligence can help intelligently conceived policy to succeed. But it cannot rescue congenitally dumb policy. Asked to address students at the National Intelligence University who were asking what they could do to help our troops in Afghanistan, I could only set their consciences at ease: No amount of Intelligence could help distinguish between friendly Youssef and unfriendly Ahmed, never mind turn the latter into the former.
At home as well, it turns out that lack of intelligence is more troublesome than lack of Intelligence. Almost all acts of terrorism are perpetrated by persons already well known to local law enforcement or to the FBI. The perpetrators are not “lone wolves” out of nowhere, but known wolves, known to Intelligence but not to intelligence. At home like abroad, our real need is for ordinary intelligence, along with ordinary virtues.
Hence, as we reshape U.S. Intelligence to better serve the Republic, we need not fear that we will deprive ourselves of knowledge for our own protection.
Function and Intelligence
Secrets help refine plans for action. They do not define action’s parameters. Their value depends on the difference they make to the plans’ success. That is why Intelligence is normally subordinated to operations. The U.S. Army, Navy, and Diplomatic service used to collect such secrets as they needed. Specific supply followed specific demand. But by establishing CIA as the central organ of U.S. intelligence, the 1947 National Security Act reversed this natural order.
CIA was to be responsible for no operations except for such covert activities as the President might order.
The Act granted CIA a near monopoly on human collection and communication with the president and Congress on Intelligence matters. It subordinated the Intelligence activities of the government’s operating departments to CIA supervision. These departments now keep control of Intelligence in which CIA is uninterested and get most of the Intelligence they need from or through CIA. Hence, they get what the CIA system produces, given its own interests and capacities, regardless of their own needs. Because the Agency soon developed its own particular predilections, the gap between what the operators need and what CIA has available has always been wide. U.S. Intelligence became controlled by the producers of secret information—not by its consumers. The results have been comparable to those of other producer-dominated systems.
CIA was created specifically and primarily to serve the president of the United States. Informing him is its primary job. But, from the beginning, CIA officers crossed the line between informing the president and claiming the right to form his mind—as well as the rest of the government’s mind. Ever less subtly, CIA has claimed that it is improper, even illegitimate, for anyone in the U.S. government, including the president, to act or even to think about foreign affairs contrary to its own supremely authoritative judgments. Over the decades, the media have echoed CIA’s complaints whenever presidents have acted regardless of or against CIA’s recommendations.
This is doubly wrong. Yes the president, constitutionally responsible as he is for the conduct of the armed forces and foreign relations, must have an architectonic view of what he is up against. But that does not mean that his advisers can know the military’s and the diplomats needs for information. Much less does it authorize the standard CIA view that its job “comprises all the major evaluative and predictive functions” and “leaves the policy-maker little or nothing in the decision-making process except the ceremonial finale.” But this has been the basis for its attempts to substitute bureaucratic authority for that of officials responsible to voters. CIA’s complaints are another instance of our ruling class’s attempt to push aside representative government in favor of the Administrative State.
In sum, since 1947, U.S. Intelligence’s basic structure has separated the collection and analysis of secrets from the functions they should serve. Having created a presidential Agency with no functions to fulfill for which it may be held responsible has encouraged that Agency—and others by imitation—to presume presidential powers. A non-responsible agency became irresponsible. We should reverse the process.
Congress, being beholden to the Agencies’ contractors, enmeshed with their bureaucracy, and ignorant of their failings given their oversight Committees’ unserious oversight, (Devin Nunes’s 2015-19 chairmanship on the House side and Malcolm Wallop’s 1981-85 budget chairmanship on the Senate side excepted) will not amend the 1947 National Security Act until it learns that it should. The president can help it learn by exercising his substantial authority to subordinate Intelligence to the government functions it is supposed to serve. Exercising that authority requires more attention to Intelligence than presidents heretofore have wanted to devote. But, the Agencies having played such a prominent part in the Resistance against President Trump, neither he nor any future president can afford not to force them out of politics while focusing them on their jobs.
The President should end the CIA’s monopoly on providing Intelligence to himself and the NSC; demand to receive his Intelligence briefings from State, Defense, and Treasury as well; order CIA to stop characterizing the documents that it produces as authoritatively and exclusively of “national” status and encourage other agencies to create whatever documents and briefings might flow from their expertise. By doing so the president would broaden the perspectives to which the top levels of government are exposed, introduce open intellectual competition in the analysis of Intelligence, and remove Intelligence officers’ temptation to substitute their judgment for that of responsible officials. Top officials, and the president himself, having become habituated to receiving just one perspective, would feel the weight of additional responsibility.
This would also be a first step in the parceling out of CIA’s functions, and a demonstration of the benefits thereof.
The President should also end the CIA’s near monopoly on human Intelligence. The need for Intelligence from persons under covers other than the ones CIA provides is undeniable. CIA did not object to the creation of a corps of undercover agents in the Justice Department’s Drug Enforcement Agency because its own people would not even try to do that dirty, dangerous work. Heretofore, however, it has objected to the military running its own deep cover agents. The president should override those objections and direct OMB to budget funds for such human Intelligence as the Services think necessary for military operations. Broadening the Services’ collection would also enrich the DOD’s analytical products.
Most of the National Security Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office are properly run by the military for military needs. But substantial technical systems that are aimed at political Intelligence are planned and controlled by CIA. Since the “take” therefrom is useful primarily for foreign relations, the State Department is best fit to judge what it needs from them. The President should decide to reorganize accordingly.
The covert exercise of political and paramilitary influence was not least of the reasons for CIA’s establishment. But international law does not treat threats, blandishments, support, or opposition any differently if done with greater or lesser degrees of secrecy. In retrospect, influence on other countries being the proximate purpose of foreign relations, the benefits of maintaining the “plausible deniability” (utter secrecy of actions being inherently impossible) of U.S. influence are difficult to understand.
Subsequent experience makes it more difficult to avoid the conclusion that covert action’s covertness was always meant to allow the U.S. government to avoid publicly confronting the question “what are we doing in the world on whose behalf?” because it is the flip side of the core domestic question: “who and what among us is right, and wrong?”
CIA’s covert actions’ covertness within the U.S. government resulted in not sufficiently thinking through their consequences. Worse, covertness allowed the U.S. government to defer basic choices between foreign policy alternatives. Often, while the State Department pursued option A, the government would keep option B alive through CIA. Multi-track policy has also been instrumental in erasing the distinction between war and peace.
The president should decide to abolish the ruinous category “covert action” and hence make the State Department responsible for the exercise of all manner of political influence abroad, and the military services responsible for military and paramilitary affairs.
The President of the United States should control Intelligence by the very means by which he controls all other parts of the National Security establishment: The National Security Council. That is, assuming that he controls it, and not the other way around.

Okamoto explains why his “electronic cash” patent may have presented obstacles to Hal Finney’s plans to make his own electronic currency.
Tatsuaki Okamoto explains why his “electronic cash” patent might have presented an obstacle to Hal Finney in his ambition to create his own electronic currency.
Six key patents
Sometime before Dec. 6, 2004, Hal Finney did a search in a patent database on “blind-signature based cash systems”. On his site he posted a list of six such patents:
“This might be useful for those considering implementing electronic cash.”
Four of the patents are authored by David Chaum, the other two by Okamoto and his colleague at Nippon Telegraph Kazuo Ohta.

Okamoto currently serves as director of the Cryptography & Information Security Lab at NTT Research and holds over 100 patents. We asked him to explain why his patent might have presented an obstacle to Hal Finney and other cypherpunks in their ambition of creating a decentralized currency, considering that his patent involves an intermediary.
Okamoto’s ecash & Nakamoto’s Bitcoin
Okamoto kindly prepared diagrams elucidating the differences between the ecash system outlined in his patent and Bitcoin (BTC).

Both solutions use public keys as pseudonymous identities and private keys to authorize transactions. However, in Okamoto’s proposal, a trusted party varies transactions, whereas Bitcoin is trustless, with all nodes verifying transactions.
Trustless system — no trivial achievement
Considering this key difference, one might ponder — why Finney and other pioneers were so paranoid about patent infringement? One obvious answer is that Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin proposal was the first successful framework for a trustless electronic cash system. Coming up with it was not a trivial achievement; almost 30 years passed between the introduction of Chaum’s DigiCash and Nakamoto’s Bitcoin.
Did “Okamoto” give ideas to Finney for “Nakamoto?”
Many believe Finney to be Satoshi Nakamoto or at least part of the team that was behind the moniker. Besides his interests, expertise and early Bitcoin involvement, another fact strongly supports this theory — being a neighbor of Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto. Considering that Google cannot return a single query for Satoshi Nakamoto before the Bitcoin proposal was publicized, this coincidence is eerie. If Finney, indeed was behind the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, his familiarity with the works of Tatsuaki Okamoto might have also played a role in the choice of the alias.
Okamoto told Cointelegraph that he was never a part of the famous cryptographic mailing lists and did not know Hal Finney personally.

A long-time friend and I have lunch every Saturday. We go sit in a beach bar here -- these days the beaches empty, the views as preternatural as ever -- drink fizzy water, no, really, decrepit diabetics like me like fizzy water, and, as I used to joke when we started this, well, tradition, plot world domination. We talk about business, mostly, current projects in general, making, hacking, and otherwise. Hardware, software, wetware. Guy stuff for geeks. Wetware as in the stuff between your ears. Mind outta the gutter. Perverts.
In these days of pandemic-panic-porn-induced incipient global collapse -- both the empty beaches thing in what used to be the kickoff of high tourist season around here, but also what could fairly be called a US electoral fight for the survival of western civilization -- one can say ‘world domination’ with a tinge of anger in one’s voice about the other side, so the joke isn’t very funny anymore. Besides, both of us are way too old for that world domination shit anymore. We’re lucky if we can hobble off to a beach bar, have a chicken caesar for lunch, and get home in one piece. Well, I am, anyway. He seems to be doing better. I need some new knees, among other things, which I’m not likely to get anytime soon here in formerly-libertarian paradise, and short of an unaffordable medical airlift to the States, practically impossible in any case with the quarantine, I’m not going anywhere anytime soon.
So, at the moment, my friend is desperately trying to keep his eyes from rolling back into his head. Because he’s driving.
I’m trying to explain to him, in as much detail as I can muster as he swerves his not-quite-a-pickup around a pothole, the current state of play in this whole business with the Universal Voter Fraud, and the Soros guy who’s now a life peer, and Chavez standing over the guy with the keyboard changing the numbers on a constitutional referendum giving him absolute dictatorial power, and... Wait, he says, these machines are hooked up the the net?? Well, yeah. I think, anyway... That’s bullshit. I can’t believe that for a minute. Nobody’d be that stupid. Well, anyway, they did a rush software update the night before the election, so, what, FedEx and flash cards? And it’s running on, what, Windows 7? Oh, come on. No, really. Pretty sure...
I mean, I’m not even sure Windows 7 had internet sockets in it, or whatever, I’m a Mac guy, bleed in five colors and all that, no, not those five colors. Pervert. But that’s how fun things here in the Year of Our Lord 2020. As John Batchelor, The World’s Last Gentleman, no, really, look at his little videos on Instagram these days, liked to say during the once-and-future GWOT, “In war, the first three reports are wrong.” And we’re only two reports in. Maybe one and a half. My friend and I are old-school cypherpunks, you see. And no, crypto doesn’t mean “cryptocurrency”, it means “strong cryptography”. We even started a conference here on what I called “financial cryptography” a few decades back, so we even get to claim at least passing familiarity, if very dated in my case, and fuzzy at the best of times, with the idea of machine security in the presence of a, cough, global geodesic internetwork.
On cypherpunks, back in the day, it was all about spooks, crypto protocols, financial and otherwise, rubber hose attacks, more spooks, actual fucking Rothbardian anarchy, not that statist commie black-block crap that passes for it these days, and, well, world domination.  Punks these days give millennialism a bad name. Get off my lawn. So, I’m very prepared to believe Sidney Powell.
I just saw a NewsMax clip on YouTube(spit!) where she says she’s gonna kick off the fun in Georgia, and, she says, it’s going to be biblical. Make it rain, baby girl. Make it rain. The fate or Western Civilization is in your hands. No pressure.

Axial Age, 2.0: Sell the State
Thanksgiving Day, November 26, 2020
Anguilla, British West Indies
Grover Norquist used to joke that a nation-state should be small enough to drown in a bathtub. Certainly the modern nation-state needs a bath, if not the whole Marat thing. Or most of our modern ‘law-speakers’ do, at any rate.
Since the Treaty of Westphalia created the modern nation-state by formally separating church from government, at least in international relations, there’s been a recursive process of shoving one’s personal beliefs about the world and one’s neighbors down the stack to the level of the individual. We’re now pretty much at the level of the sovereign religious individual now, the number of protestant sects being pretty much uncountable. Even more fun, each regular church-goer is usually a dissenting denomination of one. There’s a joke Unitarian-Universalists tell about themselves, something I used to be before I well, converted, to metaphysical naturalism: “Why are UUs such bad singers?” “They’re scanning the hymn ahead to see if they agree with it.”
Lawyers like to point to Runnymeade as the place where that idea starts with national authority instead of religion, though Anglo-Saxon society, like all Germanic culture, was inherently anarchic to begin with, Western culture has been trending towards individual freedom ever since.  Theologians and philosophers point to the so-called axial age -- the thousand years or so beginning immediately after the iron age renaissance until what Jews and atheists call the common era, giving us Confucius, Buddha, Socrates and Jesus -- as the time when religion and metaphysics stopped being a supernatural environmental externality and more about, as Paul lifted from the Stoics and shoved into Christian Canon, individual conscience. The movie-plot definition of ‘Hebrew’ is ‘argues with God’, remember.
With the current, shall we say, contretemps, over a presidential election, there is every inch the threat that things in the US at least, and possibly the world, might go, in the arcana of military euphemism, “recursively kinetic”. Westphalia again. Again, the hard way. With Moore’s Law telescoping events. Maybe not thirty years, but three years this time. Or three months. Or days. Hours? Rwanda everywhere, all at once. Lions and Tigers and Bears living together, Mr. Mayor. Biblical stuff, indeed, Miz Sidney.
The whole world, slouching towards, heh, involuntary devolution. In place of the USA, three countries in ten years. Thirty countries in fifty. Three hundred in a century? And not just the US, but everywhere. All the big countries turning into swarms of smaller ones. China. Russia. India. Brazil. Nigeria. Egypt. South Africa. Canada. Mexico. I used to say that the US had to re-federalize or die. Maybe it’s too late. I even wonder sometimes about Switzerland, the archetype of federalism, a country without even a capital. Moore’s law lowers Coase’s floor. More and smaller firms, including nation-states. Let ten thousand countries bloom, the very world Nicholas Negroponte predicted twenty years ago.
At least a couple months ago, I had assumed otherwise, that devolution to a world like the above would be peaceful, voluntary, market based; I’m still hoping so. A peaceful path to universal individual sovereignty. Nation states with the social significance of protestant sects. Sports teams.
How? With free markets, of course. Just sell government off.
No. Really. All of it. Starting with the all the stuff that government, an organization intended to hurt people and break things, does besides, you know, hurting people and breaking things.
The old libertarian battle cry was ‘sell the roads’. So, yes, sell the roads. How? A car drives down a road, paying the abutters as it goes. Part of the value of any property is its utility, its usefulness. That means rights of way, navigable rights of way, for all kinds of people, the public, in other words. That’s why it’s called a ‘public way’, after all. The public pays for the road, increasing its utility to the owner, this time without the phlogiston of ‘externalities’. Dirigistes can go calculate their prices on somebody else’s dime. Done. Sell the roads. Just sell them. Auction them off to the abutters and they can charge cars as they drive by. Raise prices with instantaneous demand. Decentralized, no, distributed, traffic ‘control’. Almost thirty years ago, I’d imagined doing the car-pays-for-the-road thing with Chaumian blind signatures, or, I’d actually thought a while later, something much smaller, probably unblinded MicroMint coins settled by probabilistic assay. Maybe people could do it with Bitcoin, and Lightning, which seems to be designed for micropayments, and Bitcoin turning out to be the exact financial cryptographic inverse of MicroMint anyway. So, sure, it’s doable, and like Bitcoin itself, when it *can* be done, it *will* be done. Physics causes finance, and all that.
Another favorite libertarian trope is that of tenth century Iceland, and yes, the lög(sögu)maður, or lawspeaker, a more or less universal germanic idea. In Iceland, the lawspeaker would recite laws once a year at the Allthing, a sort of combination annual fair, swap meet, singles bar, and law court. There, at Thingvallir, ‘Thing Valley’, on the exact geologic hotspot where the Atlantic Ocean is ripping itself in half, law, decisions, were sold. You hired a judge to decide an issue in order to prevent violence, a chronic problem where everybody was absolutely armed to the teeth. Even murder was a tort. Everybody had a literal price on their head, and if you killed someone, you paid that amount to their family or you were declared an outlaw and anybody could kill you for free. Brutal but fair. And cheap. So, there were, sort of, a few laws that everybody more or less agreed to, in order to keep things moving along. Like the ‘code’ of Hammurabi, which it now turns out wasn’t actually promulgated *laws*, but a compilation of common law *decisions’*, the law speaker would recite a quarter of those laws every year, very much in keeping with a verbal story-culture, this being the culture of memorized epics -- sagas -- remember. If it didn’t ‘speak’ a law after four years, it stopped being a law. Again, brutal, but fair. And cheap.
So, yes, law was for sale, and, elsewhere, that kind of thing ended up in force-monopoly and empire. Remember, they didn’t call the old rulers of early Israel ‘Judges’, for nothing. The Persian empire was the result of a single judge, Cyrus the Great, achieving a ‘natural monopoly’ on force. Mohammed was hired as a judge in Medina, remember, and, after they had fought each other to a lethal standstill, and with, strangely enough, the equivalent of a global pandemic, down went both the Persians and the Byzantines in a historical eye-blink.
So. Sell the law. No. Really. The executive ‘branch’ is more properly the function of firms anyway. Okay, in this world *everything’s* a firm. Hierarchy, spans of literal dominance and control, and “chains” of command, belong inside of firms, competing firms at that, and not binding us all up in the universally hierarchical tyranny like feudal China. Or France. Or the Soviet Union. Or Communist China, for that matter. Since Marxism, by denying free markets, is just feudalism in drag anyway. Or, ultimately, right now, if we let it happen, the United States of America.
Finally, there’s legislation, something that could properly be handled by common law anyway. In the same way that a free market distributes resources far better than force and fiat, a concatenation of case law does a much better job of regulating the transfer of property and services than five hundred and thirty seven wolves voting on which one of us is their next dinner at the French Laundry.
So, yes, sell the law.
You’re seeing where I’m going with this. Ron Paul and his friends imagined a US constitutional amendment prohibiting government from competing with *any* business. “Free markets for everything” is another popular libertarian slogan.
So. If you see it, and the government owns it, sell it: When in doubt, sell it off. More on this in detail later, but, remember, market monopoly only exists in the presence of monopolistic *force*. So, that means, like the judges in Iceland, free markets. And geodesic networks create geodesic markets, including those for force. Force, I liked to say is conserved. It’ll be come more evenly distributed, and, hopefully, less violent. An armed society is a polite society, as Heinlein liked to say. Don’t smash the state, silly Marxist. Sell it off.
Okay, and I get asked this a lot. Am I prescriptive here, or am I descriptive? I’m descriptive. I’m pointing at left-field, calling my shot, and swinging for the fences. Reality, especially market reality, is not optional. You can’t fight the tape. Just as the internal combustion engine gives us powered individual transport and flight, I think that geodesic networks and financial cryptography give us recursively smaller firms, and thus markets for those firms, including markets for force. But trying to immanentize the eschaton never works, Bullwinkle. Like international Marxism, that just kills people. Here’s hoping we figure this out, and our own private Westphalia is a peaceful one, and that the fight against cultural Marxism also happens, by surprise, without a shot.
Sell the state.

I suppose the following may read like a bunch of gobbledegook to most people, but I suppose I can’t really care. It makes sense to me at the moment. Though I need a nap, now.
A frequent trope of the cypherpunk list in the middle 1990’s was the character J. Random Cypherpunk. The name is self-explanatory, but he had just as much cred there as a social/political variable as the cryptographic variables Alice, Bob, Carol, or Dave. Mrs. RAH and I had a cat named Alice and still have a dog named Dave. Heh. Never got around to using Randy before Mrs. RAH took away my nomenclature card, but we did get to Eve, Mallory, Rusty (Trusty, Trusted Entity, whatever, Trent was just too foppish, didn’t lend itself to a dog’s call name), all of whom are gone, now. Animals after them had sensible names, like Red, an aging black-mouthed bob-tailed red “heeler” who likes to sleep on my right foot like he owns it, particularly around suppertime.
Somehow this afternoon I’m thinking about the universe, the simulation thereof, the multiverse, and anthropism, and out pops J. Random Universe.
It’s all about randomness. It’s now obvious to me that you can’t study infinity without randomness. Any first semester calculus student knows that. I must have smoked a number on the way to class that day. Epsilons and deltas were boring, and it turns out that they were just tacked onto calculus after the fact to keep it nailed down so it didn’t blow away. Nonetheless, I argue this with the same lumpen-enthusiasm that I argue about the recent ‘discovery’ of mine that has been obvious to anyone else, like, say, my recent breathtaking intuition, after four of five decades of acquaintance with it, that Hegelianism is pure and simple moral relativism. In the same Hegelian vein, I suppose it’s safe to say that since history is the application of a human narrative to previous events, it is an art, and not a science to begin with. Another thing that everybody figured out long before I did, and completely agrees to Popper’s proof that Marxism is pseudoscience. You always know the end of a story before you can write it, or at least re-write it into actual coherence. Post hoc, etc.
I have a friend who’s a priest, more fun, a converted Mormon, who has said at least once in public that I’m going to end up a ‘towel-boy in purgatory’ because of my backslid-from-Unitarian-but-declared-anyway metaphysical naturalism. Since we’re talking about stuff that sends the average scientific, or at least mathematical, dogmatic atheist scurrying to the confessional, this should be entertaining. Right. Cosmology. Sorry. This is going to be one of those things for which a preamble is not really necessary. I needed to pad things out a bit.
Everybody knows by now that a single universe cannot contain all the unlikelihood that life exists in this one, much less   intelligence, for various values thereof. Gelertner, Berlinsky, and Meyer are all over this like a duck on a junebug. Heard it on a Hoover podcast with Peter Robinson last year. They point and laugh at a multiverse, especially the idea that some anthropic principal dictates it. I don’t agree. Not the first time I don’t agree with geniuses, I guess. It seems to me that anthropism in a multiverse is quite handy. If, like calculus, it hasn’t found it’s epsilons and deltas just yet, relying on infinity as a ‘no matter where you go, there you are’ in answer to ‘why are we here’, is as good a hack as any.
Which brings me to the idea of a universal simulation. Without following the turtles *all* the way down, I’d like to propose a cypherpunk’s solution. The universe is discovered, not calculated. God does, it seems, play dice, to the extent that a literary character, um, plays. Not only is the universe unknowable by sheer dint of processing power, any arbitrary community of humans, much less a single one, cannot process enough information to calculate the entire universe in the Newtonian sense, or the Misian sense, for that matter.  Nor can any machine or arbitrary community of machines do that. ‘Community’ is fraught here, machine-wise, because it implies all kinds of things like emotion, the simulation of same, dominance hierarchies of emoting beings versus geodesics of processors, and all kinds of off the wall whoop-de-do, *gasping for air...* but also, the universe, at the quantum level is *random*. Incalculable, all the way up, all the way down. You can’t fool me Lord Russell.
If you were to simulate this universe, you would need to simulate randomness. At this point cypherpunks are waving their arms, semaphore, at the back of the room, while real cryptographers smirk in the front row. Pseudorandomness requires a seed. A key. And if you have a key, you can now *predict* the results of the simulation without having to run it to begin with. Obviously this is wrong, full of amphiboly. But I’m too lazy to think about it now because it’s time for a nap.

The Idea That a Scientific Theory Can Be 'Falsified' Is a Myth - Scientific American
Mano SinghamSeptember 7, 2020
J.B.S. Haldane, one of the founders of modern evolutionary biology theory, was reportedly asked what it would take for him to lose faith in the theory of evolution and is said to have replied, “Fossil rabbits in the Precambrian.” Since the so-called “Cambrian explosion” of 500 million years ago marks the earliest appearance in the fossil record of complex animals, finding mammal fossils that predate them would falsify the theory.
But would it really?
The Haldane story, though apocryphal, is one of many in the scientific folklore that suggest that falsification is the defining characteristic of science. As expressed by astrophysicist Mario Livio in his book Brilliant Blunders: "[E]ver since the seminal work of philosopher of science Karl Popper, for a scientific theory to be worthy of its name, it has to be falsifiable by experiments or observations. This requirement has become the foundation of the ‘scientific method.’”
But the field known as science studies (comprising the history, philosophy and sociology of science) has shown that falsification cannot work even in principle. This is because an experimental result is not a simple fact obtained directly from nature. Identifying and dating Haldane's bone involves using many other theories from diverse fields, including physics, chemistry and geology. Similarly, a theoretical prediction is never the product of a single theory but also requires using many other theories. When a “theoretical” prediction disagrees with “experimental” data, what this tells us is that that there is a disagreement between two sets of theories, so we cannot say that any particular theory is falsified.
Fortunately, falsification—or any other philosophy of science—is not necessary for the actual practice of science. The physicist Paul Dirac was right when he said, "Philosophy will never lead to important discoveries. It is just a way of talking about discoveries which have already been made.” Actual scientific history reveals that scientists break all the rules all the time, including falsification. As philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn noted, Newton's laws were retained despite the fact that they were contradicted for decades by the motions of the perihelion of Mercury and the perigee of the moon. It is the single-minded focus on finding what works that gives science its strength, not any philosophy. Albert Einstein said that scientists are not, and should not be, driven by any single perspective but should be willing to go wherever experiment dictates and adopt whatever works.
Unfortunately, some scientists have disparaged the entire field of science studies, claiming that it was undermining public confidence in science by denying that scientific theories were objectively true. This is a mistake since science studies play vital roles in two areas. The first is that it gives scientists a much richer understanding of their discipline. As Einstein said: "So many people today—and even professional scientists—seem to me like somebody who has seen thousands of trees but has never seen a forest. A knowledge of the historic and philosophical background gives that kind of independence from prejudices of his generation from which most scientists are suffering. This independence created by philosophical insight is—in my opinion—the mark of distinction between a mere artisan or specialist and a real seeker after truth." The actual story of how science evolves results in inspiring more confidence in science, not less.
The second is that this knowledge equips people to better argue against antiscience forces that use the same strategy over and over again, whether it is about the dangers of tobacco, climate change, vaccinations or evolution. Their goal is to exploit the slivers of doubt and discrepant results that always exist in science in order to challenge the consensus views of scientific experts. They fund and report their own results that go counter to the scientific consensus in this or that narrow area and then argue that they have falsified the consensus. In their book Merchants of Doubt, historians Naomi Oreskes and Erik M. Conway say that for these groups “[t]he goal was to fight science with science—or at least with the gaps and uncertainties in existing science, and with scientific research that could be used to deflect attention from the main event.”
Science studies provide supporters of science with better arguments to combat these critics, by showing that the strength of scientific conclusions arises because credible experts use comprehensive bodies of evidence to arrive at consensus judgments about whether a theory should be retained or rejected in favor of a new one. These consensus judgments are what have enabled the astounding levels of success that have revolutionized our lives for the better. It is the preponderance of evidence that is relevant in making such judgments, not one or even a few results.
So, when anti-vaxxers or anti-evolutionists or climate change deniers point to this or that result to argue that they have falsified the scientific consensus, they are making a meaningless statement. What they need to do is produce a preponderance of evidence in support of their case, and they have not done so.
Falsification is appealing because it tells a simple and optimistic story of scientific progress, that by steadily eliminating false theories we can eventually arrive at true ones. As Sherlock Holmes put it, “When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.” Such simple but incorrect narratives abound in science folklore and textbooks. Richard Feynman in his book QED, right after “explaining” how the theory of quantum electrodynamics came about, said, "What I have just outlined is what I call a “physicist’s history of physics,” which is never correct. What I am telling you is a sort of conventionalized myth-story that the physicists tell to their students, and those students tell to their students, and is not necessarily related to the actual historical development which I do not really know!"
But if you propagate a “myth-story” enough times and it gets passed on from generation to generation, it can congeal into a fact, and falsification is one such myth-story.
