@_subject: Cypherpunks is broken - Welcome to Secret Admirers 
TL;DR, apply here: It's been more than 20 years since the the Cypherpunk's manifesto was
published and we believe it's more important today than it was back And like the manifesto, we believe in action more than in talk.
Just as software and hardware can be developed for surveillance so can it be for better privacy and a truly free cyberspace. Technology
itself is neutral, we choose what to build with it. The reason so little
has been achieved lately is because we lost track of a fundamental point
from the manifesto:
     Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software      defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do,
     we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow
     Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all
     to use, worldwide. We don't much care if you don't approve of the
     software we write.
It seems that the original Cypherpunks mailing list degraded into a
debating society and very little new code is written. The ratio has become abysmal. Intellectual masturbation won't give us more
privacy - deployed code does.
Towards that end we founded the Secret Admirers. This is what we offer -
for members only:
     - The Secret Admirers mailing list (only reachable via Tor).
     - The Secret Admirers mailing list archive.
     - Mail account on the Secret Admirers server to communicate with the
       mailing list and other members (IMAP).
     - Git repository hosting (with read access for all member      - Members can edit a user file on the server (for example, to        their public PGP key).
Secret Admirers Rules

     - For all software and systems we design the following holds true:        more privacy it provides the better. This usually implies that        cryptography is used as well.
     - Discussions on the Secret Admirers mailing list should be in regard to
       Cypherpunk... how to build better systems. Members are expected to
       communicate in a civilized manner and try to maintain a high
