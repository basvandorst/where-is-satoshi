I have sometimes fed by paranoia cells by imagining such a separate secure machine interconnected via a rather hard-to-hack link: Taylor UUCP.
I guess that reveals my age, and the fact most of my ideas are, well... not always practical.

Agreed. Although I would use the work "refined" not censored.
Interestingly, Yahoo lists did an excellent job of stripping out such crapola and serving up useful ASCII. The other commercial mailing list services [Google, etc] don't offer it at all AFAIK.
But Yahoo has been "improving" things... they call it NEO. As part of a larger disaster, they have removed that feature.

Three Felonies a Day is the story of how citizens from all walks of
life—doctors, accountants, businessmen, political activists, and
others—have found themselves the targets of federal prosecutions, despite
sensibly believing that they did nothing wrong, broke no laws, and harmed
not a single person. From the perspective of both a legal practitioner who
has represented the wrongfully-accused, and of a legal observer who has
written about these trends for the past four decades, Three Felonies a Day
brings home how individual liberty is threatened by zealous crusades from
the Department of Justice. Even the most intelligent and informed citizen
(including lawyers and judges, for that matter) cannot predict with any
reasonable assurance whether a wide range of seemingly ordinary activities
might be regarded by federal prosecutors as felonies.

I know an amusing story with the USSS and certain hardly large ISP.
They got served with the usual paper, as they had many times before. One thing looked different, however. They pulled file copies of past USSS subpoenas, and this was one paragraph of boilerplate shorter. You guessed it, the agent had left out the "Shhh! You can't tell..." paragraph. Oops, perils of cut & paste.
So they checked with their attorney, who noted that point as well. And they set up the vacuum cleaner on the account in question, and per instructions, emailed the USSS agent......and cc'ed their subscriber.
The agent was quite upset and irate, with a variety of threats.....until they pointed out her demand was one paragraph short. Then she got even nastier, as she realized she'd stepped in it.
Finally a more senior DOJ person explained to her that Pogo applied in spades[1] and she shut up and went away, none too happy.
The End.
