@_subject: Brit spies can legally hack PCs and phones, 
I'm wondering how well it's going to go over with the USG that Brit
spies can legally hack US computers.  Not that I don't trust The Reg
or anything, but I wanted to see how well their story matched up with
the ruling.  Guess what?  The PDF of the ruling has gone missing :)
The Tribunal is required by law (RIPA section 69(6)(b)) not to
disclose material provided to it which would threaten the national
interest, national security, operations against serious crime or any
functions of the intelligence agencies. However, it has concluded that
publication of a ruling on a point of law or on the basis of assumed
facts does not compromise these areas or the ‘neither confirm nor
deny’ principle by which the intelligence agencies operate. It seeks
where possible to publish its judgments.
I guess somebody decided it was best not to publish that particular ruling.

@_subject: CREST: CIA Records Search Tool 
If anyone can access the database from a laptop on the guest wireless
then something like
  would give the rest of the world access.  But if access is allowed
from only a NARA computer you're pretty much SOL..
Not at all weird; it seems pretty effective to me.  Over 11 million
pages "released" and only 10% _printed_ (as in someone would have to
scan the page to get it back into electronic format) sounds like a
pretty good access control system for something you don't really want
to make public.

Where is it presented as a transparency tool?  They seem to be real
clear about what they're doing:
  "In order to directly access CREST, a researcher must visit the
National Archives at
   College Park, Maryland. CIA recognizes that such visits may be
inconvienent and
   present an obstacle to many researchers."
