Yes, there are enthusiasts.

I read their security section. The first thing in my mind (i am not tooooo

Not even a mention.
Who supports them? Can we trust him/it?
Are they millionaires:)?
We see not even one word about the money.
Second of all, when you read their

Too much ideal.
So yes, i rely on my feelings too, and there is something wrong with that.

The West's Shame
There is something so bizarre, so inhumane about Western countries
boycotting the parade for the 70th anniversary of the Soviet victory over
Germany in World War II that I just had to write on it. Recently, the prime
minister of the United Kingdom announced he will not be attending the
parade. Previous to that, countries like Germany and the United States had
announced the same. It's only a parade you say? No it's more than that.
The Soviet Union sacrificed 25 million people to defeat Nazi Germany in
World War II. A sacrifice beyond imagination, and far, far greater than all
the countries fighting Nazi Germany combined. In comparison, the Holocaust,
which is rightly remembered annually, claimed the lives of six million
people of the Jewish faith. These are really the two true tragedy's of
World War II unleashed on the world by Nazi Germany. The stories of Soviet
soldiers advancing without weapons to pickup the rifle of the next dead
soldier are well known. The bloodbath of Stalingrad, the siege of
Leningrad, the millions of Soviet soldiers killed and captured (only to
then die in POW camps) during the early days of the German invasion, and so
on, all markers of the brutality of man against his own, stand large in the
history of the world. In fact, the German invasion of the Soviet Union
stands as the largest military battle in the history of man.
Yet, western leaders have decided to not attend the parade that is meant to
honour that sacrifice. When Britain announced it would not attend, well,
that's the straw that broke the camel's back frankly. Of all the countries
in the world, Britain was saved by the massive waves of young Soviet men
and woman that bled the German army white. Hitler would have crushed
Britain in short order if he had not diverted millions of German men to the
invasion of the Soviet Union. Crucially, the diversion of aircraft,
fighters and bombers, to the Soviet front saved Britain from the entire
annihilation of a full blown, continuous air campaign, and the subsequent
naval invasion that would certainly have occurred. In reality, the western
allies left Stalin almost alone in Europe to battle the Nazi's, and take
the majority of the casualties in doing so. By the time D-Day finally
arrived, the German army and air force was only a shadow of it's former
self as it existed in 1941. As bad and hard as it was for the allies to
march east through Europe to Berlin, without the Soviet people's sacrifice,
it would have never happened.
It's a place of honour in human history. To quarrel with that is to go
beyond ignorance. To quarrel with that is the hateful and arrogant bastion
of the very seeds that caused World War II in the first place. And now, as
if history is repeating itself, Western leaders have entered that bastion
of ignorance and arrogance to punish Russia for the Ukrainian civil war. By
contrast, Russian president Putin, despite the ongoing conflict in Ukraine,
attended the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings in France last year. He
was given the proverbial cold shoulder by western leaders, yet he subjected
himself to that, in honour of the sacrifice of the men of Canada, Britain
and the United States. He did not ignore the history or the price in blood
of that action. He honoured it. He put the sacrifice ahead of his political
position, and it could even be said his personal shunning. Now that the
time is here to do the same for the Soviet Union's dead, we cannot bring
ourselves to do the same.
What that says about us is really quite obvious. It means we haven't
learned the lessons of history. That our political leadership has become so
petty, so detached from historical reality, that it attempts to rewrite the
history of 25 million souls. That is the danger of all of this. Russians
don't really need the West to honour their sacrifice. They know it all too
well. It's the West that needs to honour that sacrifice so it can clearly
see the dangers of war on a scale far more destructive than anything it
experienced on the western front, or anywhere else in history. Poland
started this train rolling by refusing to invite the Russian president to
the Holocaust remembrance at Auschwitz last year. This despite the fact
that the Soviet army liberated all of Poland, and specifically Auschwitz
from German armies.
The actions of our western politicians say more about us than the Russians
could ever say themselves. They have portrayed us as people who refuse to
honour the dead, those that gave their lives in another time to defeat a
tyrant bent on world domination, and in doing so dishonour those men and
women. As the son of a young man, training in England, fighting in North
Africa, Italy, Holland, and Germany through those tumultuous years of war
and senseless slaughter, I recognize the Soviet sacrifice that probably
saved my Dad's life. How could you not? Yet, that is exactly what our
politicians are doing today. You don't have to be a lover of this country,
or that country to recognize and honour grave human injustice committed on
a massive scale. You just have to be humane, and subordinate your own bias
in the remembrance of the fallen. Is that really so hard? Isn't that what
is expected of us all? Wouldn't we expect that from our children? I've
never been so ashamed of the actions of our governments than I am now with
the boycott of that parade in Moscow.

position, and it could even be said his personal shunning. Now that the
time is here to do the same for the Soviet Union's dead, we cannot bring
ourselves to do the same.
What that says about us is really quite obvious. It means we haven't
learned the lessons of history. That our political leadership has become so
petty, so detached from historical reality, that it attempts to rewrite the
history of 25 million souls. That is the danger of all of this. Russians
don't really need the West to honour their sacrifice. They know it all too
well. It's the West that needs to honour that sacrifice so it can clearly
see the dangers of war on a scale far more destructive than anything it
experienced on the western front, or anywhere else in history. Poland
started this train rolling by refusing to invite the Russian president to
the Holocaust remembrance at Auschwitz last year. This despite the fact
that the Soviet army liberated all of Poland, and specifically Auschwitz
from German armies.
The actions of our western politicians say more about us than the Russians
could ever say themselves. They have portrayed us as people who refuse to
honour the dead, those that gave their lives in another time to defeat a
tyrant bent on world domination, and in doing so dishonour those men and
women. As the son of a young man, training in England, fighting in North
Africa, Italy, Holland, and Germany through those tumultuous years of war
and senseless slaughter, I recognize the Soviet sacrifice that probably
saved my Dad's life. How could you not? Yet, that is exactly what our
politicians are doing today. You don't have to be a lover of this country,
or that country to recognize and honour grave human injustice committed on
a massive scale. You just have to be humane, and subordinate your own bias
in the remembrance of the fallen. Is that really so hard? Isn't that what
is expected of us all? Wouldn't we expect that from our children? I've
never been so ashamed of the actions of our governments than I am now with
the boycott of that parade in Moscow.

*Stanley Kubrick Confesses To Faking The Moon Landings*
A stunning new video has emerged 15 years after Stanley Kubrick’s death in
which Kubrick allegedly admits that the NASA moon landings were faked.
Filmmaker T. Patrick Murray says he interviewed Kubrick three days before
his death in March 1999. He was forced to sign an 88-page NDA to keep the
contents of the interview a secret for 15 years.
Below is a transcript from the interview with Stanley Kubrick, in which the
2001 Space Odyssey Director admits on camera that, “the moon landings ALL
were faked , and that I was the person who filmed it.”
We have included a leaked rough cut of the film below the transcript as
well as two unedited raw videos of the interview with Kubrick below that:
*K: I’m so preoccupied. With my work, innovation, risk-taking, regrets…T:
Why are you giving this interview?K: Because, it started to get to me after
awhile. Well, this is difficult, because it is the first time I’ve talked
about it. (sighs)T: Sure, take all the time you need.K: I’ve always been
conflicted by it, but not consciously until years later. I was just blown
away by the chance, the opportunity, the challenge of making this, this
production, and I went into this like it was a regular film, like another
regular film of mine, not thinking too much about uh the long term effects
of what it would mean to society if it was ever discovered.T: What are you
talking about? I’m dying to know what you’re talking about.K: Well, a
confession of sorts. A movie I made, that nobody is aware of – even though
they’ve seen it.T: A movie you made, no one knows you made? Is that what
you said?K: That’s right. Is that intriguing? Do I have you intrigued?K: I
perpetrated a huge fraud on the American public, which I am now about to
detail, involving the United States government and NASA, that the moon
landings were faked, that the moon landings ALL were faked , and that I was
the person who filmed it.T: Ok. (laughs) What are you talking…You’re
serious. Ok.K: I’m serious. Dead serious.K: Yes, it was fake.T: Ok. Wait.
Wait…T: I don’t want this to be an R-rated film, but seriously, what the
blank, but seriously…T: I, I, I worked almost eight months to secure this
once in a lifetime interview that almost no else could ever get, and
instead of talking about his sixteen films that I’ve endured since I was a
child…That we didn’t land on the moon, you’re saying?K: No, we didn’t.K: It
was not real.T: The moon landings were fake?K: A, a, a.. fictional moon
landing. A fantasy. It was not real.K: Don’t you think it’s important for
people to know the truth?T: The moon landing in ’69, which was two years
before my birth…K: Is total fiction.T: Total fiction.T: Is that?…So, that’s
the 15 year thing. So that’s makes sense now. That’s why I can’t release it
for 15 years now, that makes total sense now.T: Did we…we didn’t land on
the moon you’re saying?K: No, we didn’t.T: Why are you telling me?K: A, a,
a, a massive fraud. An unparalleled fraud perpetrated against them. They
SHOULD know.K: Nixon want to uh, they were planning, yeah, he want to fake
this, this moon landing…T: Are you contending that people DON’T want to
know the truth about the world, reality, the moon landings…?K: The
government, knowing this, takes advantage of it by perpetrating fraud after
fraud after fraud.T: How did you end up giving in? Being complicit with
this fraud?K: I didn’t want to do it.T: This is NOT where I thought this
interview was going!K: With my help, with my, with my aid, and it is, it is
bothering me.T: I only have this certain amount of time with you. And I’ll
talk about whatever you want, but…T: You’re not…This isn’t some type of
joke, or…K: No. No, it’s not.T: Or a film within a film thing…K: Not
joking. NOPE.T: Okay.K: The conspiracy theorists were right, on this
occasion.T: I don’t know what to ask you first.K: I thought it was wrong, I
just…I didn’t believe in perpetrating a fraud like that.T: But you did.K:
It also undermined my artistic integrity to do that.T: Ok, but you ended up
saying yes. Why?K: Well, yes, but because basically I was bribed. To put it
bluntly, that’s what it was. It was just a plain fucking bribe.T: Why are
you telling me?K:A, a, a, massive fraud. An unparalleled fraud perpetrated
against them. They SHOULD know! Don’t you think it’s important for people
to know the truth?T: Why did they have to fake it? Why? Why would they ever
need to do something like that? Why would the government ever want or need
to do…K: It’s no secret that NASA always wanted to fulfill this Kennedy
prophecy.T: Take it from the beginning…T: I gotta be honest, this is where
he (Kubrick) got me. I mean, when I actually put myself in his position,
when I actually imagine that he was telling the truth, and that he was
presented with this opportunity and if in the one in a billion chance that
I lived his life and I was presented with the same opportunity, what would
I do?T: Yeah, he wanted his approval points up and he thought nothing could
do it better than this.T: What a conflict. I mean, gosh, I can’t imagine
being presented with that opportunity. On one hand, I’d really would want
to do it, but then I’d probably say I’m committing a crime, and lying…T: It
depends, but my guess would be…no, if you’re good, but you would do it.K:
Spielberg, (inaudible) Scorsese, even Woody Allen. There isn’t one of them
who wouldn’t do this.T: I gotta admit: I’d do it. I’d do it too.T: But they
dangled all this power and all this flattery on you, essentially?K: Yeah,
it got to me after awhile. You can listen to so much of that stuff before
you start to believe it.T: They just said you were the greatest and
stuff?K: Yeah, yeah – and I agreed with them.K: Why are you telling the
world? Why does the world need to know that the moon landings aren’t real
and you faked them?K: Which I consider to be my masterpiece.T: And you
can’t take credit, or even talk about…K: Well, I am now..T: Right, so
you’ll be dead. In ten years, or 15…K: Right, ten or 15 something like
that.T: So, you can’t talk to Roger Ebert about it. Does that frustrate
you?T: Why did they have to fake it? Why would they have to do that?K:
Because it is impossible to get there.T: Ok, back up, back up, back up….*

oh... this mainstream argument is so expected. wau.
The Wikipedia & USFake Nasa are the most reliable resources on earth,
aren't they?
*Those retro-reflectors were planted on the Moon by HUMAN BEINGS and they
couldn't be planted by a moon-walker robot (like the Russians did before
Apollo program)?...*
And in the meantime, think about the following logical question:
Why is it that today (almost 50 years AFTER the moon fairy tale), the
Americans buy Russian engines in order to deliver their rockets into cosmic
orbit? Where are the pooower engines of the "grand" Apollo program? There
are no such. *Then on which engines Americans flew to the moon 50 years
ago?* This technology was "lost" or stolen by the "bloody soviet agents"...
or maybe it has never been existed like their human landings?!
Moreover, there is very basic question like:
Where is the solid evidence that these retro-reflectors are indeed American
and not... Russian? The Russians sent to the moon several moonwalkers
"Lunokhod" who left there a similar technique before the Americans mission
began in the mid-60s.
Also, we can question the whole Apollo program and not only the human
landings - not only on which engines Americans flew to the moon, but what
happened to the "hundreds" of kg of lunar soil, allegedly brought to earth
by the the Apollo expeditions? We want them to give, let's say, 10 kg to an
INTERNATIONAL (not USfake) scientific organization with Russian and Chinese
scientists who will investigate it (oh, sorry, it's too secret and maybe
too altruistic for the "God's chosen nation" which cares about the welfare
of the whole world).
And most of all, as i already said:
*Where is the solid evidence that these retro-reflectors were delivered
personally by HUMAN astronauts to the moon, and not by moonwalker as was
done by the Russians years before the fake Apollo program?*
*Тhere are no material, univocal and NON-american evidences for already
over half a century.And the rest - is policy and propaganda. Very dirty.
Like the fake tube that Colin Powell shook** in the UN before the invasion
to Iraq.*
As my friend said "this moon folklore is too dear to their hearts", is'nt
Well, it is not "more dear" than the folklore of the communist
threat/Vietnam/Bosnia/Iraq/ 9-11/the bloody Putin. And the best of all is
the folklore that "we are the chosen (by whom?!) leaders of the earth, =>
thus only we are the good guys and everyone else, who is not our economic
slave, is BAD => and should be destroyed "for the sake of the world".
*Question everything that has ever been done by all USA officials
(especially the last 80 years). At least 90% of all their words and actions
are lies, provocations and deceitful propaganda. There has never been in
the human history such a rotten and vile government & ruling elite as it is
in the USA (as a consequence, weak and deceived nation).*
Those moon fake landings are just the edge of the iceberg.

I can't believe i read bullshit like these kind of arguments from educated
persons. Well, i will try to answer in the most political-correct manner.
It's my last comment on the Moon issue, i promise.
It is not pointless at all, buddy. Because the past SHAPES the present.
There is NO today without yesterday. And there is NO "good" today with
"rotten" yesterday (part of which is the moon flam).
We are talking here about a lie. A LIE as big as the size of the moon. *And
if a state can lie such lies, this kind of state has no right to call
itself "democratic/special/good/free/honest" state... or the leader of the
human race. Not talking about bombing other states "for the good sake of
all the others". Such State should be called with an appropriate name. And
have no rights on the world stage, not to mention a Leadership.*
It is indeed pointless to talk about the "great new world of today" which
you and many others see through pink glasses (and there is no such world
today). Because the US fabrication like the "moon" lie is shaping our
present (which you love so much), and even more -
*it is continuing to happen "HERE & NOW".*
Now, the US lie is not about the "moon" but about the bad Assad in Syria,
chemicals in Iraq, freedom to Lybian people, Russian invasion to
Ukraine...etc. It's all happening right here and right now, buddy (On
20/12/2015). *And will continue to happen until good and smart people will
believe in these lies *(this is the cause i write to this list trying to
prevent this)*. Or until there will be "sheeple" like you, who live in an
illusive "here & now" without caring about their yesterday/the truth.*
You missed the whole CORE point. Or misleaded the discussion on purpose.
Well, you have failed.

And with this kind of slave is really impossible to discuss anything. He
never questions any of his smart ideas. He "knows" and he is "sure" for

Well, you are just another "punk​" of the Western-pseudo-mass-media

is ALL of this just propaganda?
Yes it is. 90% of it is a cheap and rubbish propaganda.
And if you didn't know, in Russia itself, there are A LOT of "bought"
journalists & media channels by the west.
The Russian government supports the violent murder of the LGBT+ community.
I think one could not say/write in more stupid way something about the
Russian government. It supports "violent" murder ONLY of terrorists and
soldiers from the armies of aggressors who invade in its sovereign land
(Napoleon, Hitler etc.).
As for the objective reality
There are indeed some murder cases of LGBT people in Russia every year. But
if you didn't know, *in EVERY country* there are cases when somebody get
killed out of all kind of reasons (including homophobia) . And one CAN NOT
say it is the "government policy" because there are some freaky
pedophiles/xenophobes/homophobes... in the country. Their percentage is
insignificant and not more than in the same greaat and bOOOld democratic US.
So, cut off your bullshit and stop whining.
Seriously, FUCK Russia.
*And seriously, FUCK YOU.*

I think one could not say/write in more stupid way something about the
Russian government. It supports "violent" murder ONLY of terrorists and
soldiers from the armies of aggressors who invade in its sovereign land
(Napoleon, Hitler etc.).
As for the objective reality
There are indeed some murder cases of LGBT people in Russia every year. But
if you didn't know, *in EVERY country* there are cases when somebody get
killed out of all kind of reasons (including homophobia) . And one CAN NOT
say it is the "government policy" because there are some freaky

Part 1:
Part 2:
*Stanley Kubrick Confesses To Faking The Moon Landings*
A stunning new video has emerged 15 years after Stanley Kubrick’s death in
which Kubrick allegedly admits that the NASA moon landings were faked.
Filmmaker T. Patrick Murray says he interviewed Kubrick three days before
his death in March 1999. He was forced to sign an 88-page NDA to keep the
contents of the interview a secret for 15 years.
Below is a transcript from the interview with Stanley Kubrick, in which the
2001 Space Odyssey Director admits on camera that, “the moon landings ALL
were faked , and that I was the person who filmed it.”
We have included a leaked rough cut of the film below the transcript as
well as two unedited raw videos of the interview with Kubrick below that:
*K: I’m so preoccupied. With my work, innovation, risk-taking, regrets…T:
Why are you giving this interview?K: Because, it started to get to me after
awhile. Well, this is difficult, because it is the first time I’ve talked
about it. (sighs)T: Sure, take all the time you need.K: I’ve always been
conflicted by it, but not consciously until years later. I was just blown
away by the chance, the opportunity, the challenge of making this, this
production, and I went into this like it was a regular film, like another
regular film of mine, not thinking too much about uh the long term effects
of what it would mean to society if it was ever discovered.T: What are you
talking about? I’m dying to know what you’re talking about.K: Well, a
confession of sorts. A movie I made, that nobody is aware of – even though
they’ve seen it.T: A movie you made, no one knows you made? Is that what
you said?K: That’s right. Is that intriguing? Do I have you intrigued?K: I
perpetrated a huge fraud on the American public, which I am now about to
detail, involving the United States government and NASA, that the moon
landings were faked, that the moon landings ALL were faked , and that I was
the person who filmed it.T: Ok. (laughs) What are you talking…You’re
serious. Ok.K: I’m serious. Dead serious.K: Yes, it was fake.T: Ok. Wait.
Wait…T: I don’t want this to be an R-rated film, but seriously, what the
blank, but seriously…T: I, I, I worked almost eight months to secure this
once in a lifetime interview that almost no else could ever get, and
instead of talking about his sixteen films that I’ve endured since I was a
child…That we didn’t land on the moon, you’re saying?K: No, we didn’t.K: It
was not real.T: The moon landings were fake?K: A, a, a.. fictional moon
landing. A fantasy. It was not real.K: Don’t you think it’s important for
people to know the truth?T: The moon landing in ’69, which was two years
before my birth…K: Is total fiction.T: Total fiction.T: Is that?…So, that’s
the 15 year thing. So that’s makes sense now. That’s why I can’t release it
for 15 years now, that makes total sense now.T: Did we…we didn’t land on
the moon you’re saying?K: No, we didn’t.T: Why are you telling me?K: A, a,
a, a massive fraud. An unparalleled fraud perpetrated against them. They
SHOULD know.K: Nixon want to uh, they were planning, yeah, he want to fake
this, this moon landing…T: Are you contending that people DON’T want to
know the truth about the world, reality, the moon landings…?K: The
government, knowing this, takes advantage of it by perpetrating fraud after
fraud after fraud.T: How did you end up giving in? Being complicit with
this fraud?K: I didn’t want to do it.T: This is NOT where I thought this
interview was going!K: With my help, with my, with my aid, and it is, it is
bothering me.T: I only have this certain amount of time with you. And I’ll
talk about whatever you want, but…T: You’re not…This isn’t some type of
joke, or…K: No. No, it’s not.T: Or a film within a film thing…K: Not
joking. NOPE.T: Okay.K: The conspiracy theorists were right, on this
occasion.T: I don’t know what to ask you first.K: I thought it was wrong, I
just…I didn’t believe in perpetrating a fraud like that.T: But you did.K:
It also undermined my artistic integrity to do that.T: Ok, but you ended up
saying yes. Why?K: Well, yes, but because basically I was bribed. To put it
bluntly, that’s what it was. It was just a plain fucking bribe.T: Why are
you telling me?K:A, a, a, massive fraud. An unparalleled fraud perpetrated
against them. They SHOULD know! Don’t you think it’s important for people
to know the truth?T: Why did they have to fake it? Why? Why would they ever
need to do something like that? Why would the government ever want or need
to do…K: It’s no secret that NASA always wanted to fulfill this Kennedy
prophecy.T: Take it from the beginning…T: I gotta be honest, this is where
he (Kubrick) got me. I mean, when I actually put myself in his position,
when I actually imagine that he was telling the truth, and that he was
presented with this opportunity and if in the one in a billion chance that
I lived his life and I was presented with the same opportunity, what would
I do?T: Yeah, he wanted his approval points up and he thought nothing could
do it better than this.T: What a conflict. I mean, gosh, I can’t imagine
being presented with that opportunity. On one hand, I’d really would want
to do it, but then I’d probably say I’m committing a crime, and lying…T: It
depends, but my guess would be…no, if you’re good, but you would do it.K:
Spielberg, (inaudible) Scorsese, even Woody Allen. There isn’t one of them
who wouldn’t do this.T: I gotta admit: I’d do it. I’d do it too.T: But they
dangled all this power and all this flattery on you, essentially?K: Yeah,
it got to me after awhile. You can listen to so much of that stuff before
you start to believe it.T: They just said you were the greatest and
stuff?K: Yeah, yeah – and I agreed with them.K: Why are you telling the
world? Why does the world need to know that the moon landings aren’t real
and you faked them?K: Which I consider to be my masterpiece.T: And you
can’t take credit, or even talk about…K: Well, I am now..T: Right, so
you’ll be dead. In ten years, or 15…K: Right, ten or 15 something like
that.T: So, you can’t talk to Roger Ebert about it. Does that frustrate
you?T: Why did they have to fake it? Why would they have to do that?K:
Because it is impossible to get there.T: Ok, back up, back up, back up….*

oh... this mainstream argument is so expected. wau.
The Wikipedia & USFake Nasa are the most reliable resources on earth,
aren't they?
*Those retro-reflectors were planted on the Moon by HUMAN BEINGS and they
couldn't be planted by a moon-walker robot (like the Russians did before
Apollo program)?...*
And in the meantime, think about the following logical question:
Why is it that today (almost 50 years AFTER the moon fairy tale), the
Americans buy Russian engines in order to deliver their rockets into cosmic
orbit? Where are the pooower engines of the "grand" Apollo program? There
are no such. *Then on which engines Americans flew to the moon 50 years
ago?* This technology was "lost" or stolen by the "bloody soviet agents"...
or maybe it has never been existed like their human landings?!
Moreover, there is very basic question like:
Where is the solid evidence that these retro-reflectors are indeed American
and not... Russian? The Russians sent to the moon several moonwalkers
"Lunokhod" who left there a similar technique before the Americans mission
began in the mid-60s.
Also, we can question the whole Apollo program and not only the human
landings - not only on which engines Americans flew to the moon, but what
happened to the "hundreds" of kg of lunar soil, allegedly brought to earth
by the the Apollo expeditions? We want them to give, let's say, 10 kg to an
INTERNATIONAL (not USfake) scientific organization with Russian and Chinese
scientists who will investigate it (oh, sorry, it's too secret and maybe
too altruistic for the "God's chosen nation" which cares about the welfare
of the whole world).
And most of all, as i already said:
*Where is the solid evidence that these retro-reflectors were delivered
personally by HUMAN astronauts to the moon, and not by moonwalker as was
done by the Russians years before the fake Apollo program?*
*Тhere are no material, univocal and NON-american evidences for already
over half a century.And the rest - is policy and propaganda. Very dirty.
Like the fake tube that Colin Powell shook** in the UN before the invasion
to Iraq.*
As my friend said "this moon folklore is too dear to their hearts", is'nt
Well, it is not "more dear" than the folklore of the communist
threat/Vietnam/Bosnia/Iraq/ 9-11/the bloody Putin. And the best of all is
the folklore that "we are the chosen (by whom?!) leaders of the earth, =>
thus only we are the good guys and everyone else, who is not our economic
slave, is BAD => and should be destroyed "for the sake of the world".
*Question everything that has ever been done by all USA officials
(especially the last 80 years). At least 90% of all their words and actions
are lies, provocations and deceitful propaganda. There has never been in
the human history such a rotten and vile government & ruling elite as it is
in the USA (as a consequence, weak and deceived nation).*
Those moon fake landings are just the edge of the iceberg.

I can't believe i read bullshit like these kind of arguments from educated
persons. Well, i will try to answer in the most political-correct manner.
It's my last comment on the Moon issue, i promise.
It is not pointless at all, buddy. Because the past SHAPES the present.
There is NO today without yesterday. And there is NO "good" today with
"rotten" yesterday (part of which is the moon flam).
We are talking here about a lie. A LIE as big as the size of the moon. *And
if a state can lie such lies, this kind of state has no right to call
itself "democratic/special/good/free/honest" state... or the leader of the
human race. Not talking about bombing other states "for the good sake of
all the others". Such State should be called with an appropriate name. And
have no rights on the world stage, not to mention a Leadership.*
It is indeed pointless to talk about the "great new world of today" which
you and many others see through pink glasses (and there is no such world
today). Because the US fabrication like the "moon" lie is shaping our
present (which you love so much), and even more -
*it is continuing to happen "HERE & NOW".*
Now, the US lie is not about the "moon" but about the bad Assad in Syria,
chemicals in Iraq, freedom to Lybian people, Russian invasion to
Ukraine...etc. It's all happening right here and right now, buddy (On
20/12/2015). *And will continue to happen until good and smart people will
believe in these lies *(this is the cause i write to this list trying to
prevent this)*. Or until there will be "sheeple" like you, who live in an
illusive "here & now" without caring about their yesterday/the truth.*

Sometimes, you just write my thoughts (which are not on English :)). So
this time, at least, i must say thank you. I salute you. I often read such

I don't know who you are from, but if you are from the "west", -
congratulations! You are free from the "USA-WEST propaganda machine".
The truth must be spread (it's not high flown words). Although it's not a

The hatred, the hypocrisy and the lawlessness of the US must be stopped.

Thank you very much again. On behalf of all people, that want peace,

Zenaan, everybody, ​this is horrible. Truly horrible.
I have read some parts of this report... I couldn't believe, honestly. I
couldn't believe, that it comes from the US. I could think it happens in
some Iran, but... US?! And i have no rose-colored glasses.
As a matter of fact, i read a few years ago many official & biographic
reports about the Gestapo torture methods (sorry about the Nazi theme). And
it was *LESS* horrible than what i saw in this *CENSORED* report!
The US have lost even the level of some kind of humanity, not to mention
the right to lead the world.
And this report, is another indisputable proof of this.

@_subject: A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace 
by John Perry Barlow
Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I
come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind. On behalf of the future, I ask
you of the past to leave us alone. You are not welcome among us. You have
no sovereignty where we gather.
We have no elected government, nor are we likely to have one, so I address
you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always
speaks. I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally
independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us. You have no moral
right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true
reason to fear.
Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You
have neither solicited nor received ours. We did not invite you. You do not
know us, nor do you know our world. Cyberspace does not lie within your
borders. Do not think that you can build it, as though it were a public
construction project. You cannot. It is an act of nature and it grows
itself through our collective actions.
You have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation, nor did you
create the wealth of our marketplaces. You do not know our culture, our
ethics, or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order
than could be obtained by any of your impositions.
You claim there are problems among us that you need to solve. You use this
claim as an excuse to invade our precincts. Many of these problems don't
exist. Where there are real conflicts, where there are wrongs, we will
identify them and address them by our means. We are forming our own Social
Contract . This governance will arise according to the conditions of our
world, not yours. Our world is different.
Cyberspace consists of transactions, relationships, and thought itself,
arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications. Ours is a
world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but it is not where bodies live.
We are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice
accorded by race, economic power, military force, or station of birth.
We are creating a world where anyone, anywhere may express his or her
beliefs, no matter how singular, without fear of being coerced into silence
or conformity.
Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and
context do not apply to us. They are all based on matter, and there is no
matter here.
Our identities have no bodies, so, unlike you, we cannot obtain order by
physical coercion. We believe that from ethics, enlightened self-interest,
and the commonweal, our governance will emerge . Our identities may be
distributed across many of your jurisdictions. The only law that all our
constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Rule. We hope
we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis. But we
cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose.
In the United States, you have today created a law, the Telecommunications
Reform Act, which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams
of Jefferson, Washington, Mill, Madison, DeToqueville, and Brandeis. These
dreams must now be born anew in us.
You are terrified of your own children, since they are natives in a world
where you will always be immigrants. Because you fear them, you entrust
your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly
to confront yourselves. In our world, all the sentiments and expressions of
humanity, from the debasing to the angelic, are parts of a seamless whole,
the global conversation of bits. We cannot separate the air that chokes
from the air upon which wings beat.
In China, Germany, France, Russia, Singapore, Italy and the United States,
you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at
the frontiers of Cyberspace. These may keep out the contagion for a small
time, but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in
bit-bearing media.
Your increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate
themselves by proposing laws, in America and elsewhere, that claim to own
speech itself throughout the world. These laws would declare ideas to be
another industrial product, no more noble than pig iron. In our world,
whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed
infinitely at no cost. The global conveyance of thought no longer requires
your factories to accomplish.
These increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same
position as those previous lovers of freedom and self-determination who had
to reject the authorities of distant, uninformed powers. We must declare
our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty, even as we continue to
consent to your rule over our bodies. We will spread ourselves across the
Planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts.
We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more
humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.

*Preamble: Our hearts go out in sorrow and grief to all those families and
friends of all the truly innocent humans who were really murdered during or
after the events in Paris by whomsoever. Their violent death certainly was
and remains a heinous and appalling crime for which the real culprits must
be brought to true justice.But, we can also not close our eyes from seeing
facts, which in these increasing numbers of "terrorist-attacks" do not fit
the "official" narrative or do not match the fake news-blasts of the
masterminded mainstream media, nor can we close our ears from the likewise
appalling war-cries on all sides of those who declare and let others fight
war (which in future's hindsight will and can only be seen as a war on
their own people) and first of all we will not close our ears and eyes from
the the cries and the plight of all those many innocent people in the
war-zones in and around Syria, the Middle East as well as North and Central
Africa, who suffer endlessly, have to finally flee their homeland.or get
killed in the proxy-wars of neo-colonialism.Thousands get killed there
every month, survivors in the tens of thousands have to flee and millions
of the population remaining behind suffer without any genuine help in
*A Most Convenient MassacreWhat a difference a single massacre can make!By
Dmitry Orlov*
November 17, 2015 "Information Clearing House" -  Just a week ago the EU
couldn't possibly figure out anything to do to stop the influx of
“refugees” from all those countries the US and NATO had bombed into
oblivion. But now, because “Paris changed everything,” EU's borders are
being locked down and refugees are being turned back.
• Just a week ago it seemed that the EU was going to be swamped by
resurgent nationalism, with incumbent political parties poised to get voted
out of power. But now, thanks to the Paris massacre, they have obtained a
new lease on life, because they can now safely embrace the same policies
that a week ago they branded as “fascist.”
• Just a week ago the EU and the US couldn't possibly bring themselves
admit that they are utterly incompetent when it comes to combating their
own creation—ISIS, that is—and need Russian help. But now, at the
après-Paris G-20 summit, everybody is ready to line up and let Putin take
charge of the war against terrorism. Look—the Americans finally found those
convoys of tanker trucks stretching beyond the horizon that ISIS has been
using to smuggle out stolen Syrian crude oil—after Putin showed them the
satellite photos!
Am I being crass and insensitive? Not at all—I deplore all the deaths from
terrorist attacks in Iraq, in Syria, in Lebanon, and in all the other
countries whose populations did absolutely nothing to deserve such
treatment. I only feel half as bad about the French, who stood by quietly
as their military helped destroy Libya (which did nothing to deserve it).
*Note that after the Russian jet crashed in the Sinai there weren't all
that many Facebook avatars with the Russian flag pasted over them, and
hardly any candlelight vigils or piles of wreaths and flowers in various
Western capitals. I even detected a whiff of smug satisfaction that the
Russians got their comeuppance for stepping out of line in Syria.Why the
difference in reaction? Simple: you were told to grieve for the French, so
you did. You were not told to grieve for the Russians, and so you didn't.
Don't feel bad; you are just following orders. The reasoning behind these
orders is transparent: the French, along with the rest of the EU, are
Washington's willing puppets; therefore, they are innocent, and when they
get killed, it's a tragedy. But the Russians are not Washington's willing
puppet, and are not innocent, and so when they get killed by terrorists,
it's punishment. And when Iraqis, or Syrians, or Nigerians get killed by
terrorists, that's not a tragedy either, for a different reason: they are
too poor to matter. In order to qualify as a victim of a tragedy, you have
to be each of these three things: 1. a US-puppet, 2. rich and 3. dead.*
Also, you probably believe that the terrorist attacks in Paris were the
genuine article—nobody knew it would happen, and it couldn't have been
stopped, because these terrorists are just too clever for the ubiquitous
state surveillance to detect. Don't feel bad about that either; you are
just believing what you are told to believe. You probably also believe that
jet fuel can melt steel girders and that skyscrapers collapse into their
own footprints (whether they've been hit by airplanes or not). You can
certainly believe whatever you like, but here are a couple of
easy-to-understand tips on telling what's real from what's fake:
1. If it's fake, the perpetrators are known immediately (and sometimes
beforehand). If it's real, then the truth is uncovered as a result of a
thorough investigation. So, for instance, on 9/11 the guilty party were a
bunch of Saudis armed with box cutters (some of whom are, paradoxically,
still alive). And in Paris we knew right away that this was done by
ISIS—even before we knew who the perpetrators were. And when that Malaysian
jet got shot down over Ukraine, we knew right away that it was the
Russians' fault (never mind that on that day the Ukrainians deployed an air
defense system, and also scrambled a couple of jets armed with air-to-air
missiles— against an enemy that doesn't have an air force). Note, however,
how we still don't know what happened with the Russian jet over Sinai (the
article was written on November 17, 2015 - before the Russian investigation
revealed the ISIS bomb in the jet). That case is still under
investigation—as it should be. If it's real, officials stall for time and
urge caution while scrambling to find out what happened. When it's fake,
the officials are ready to go with the Big Lie, and then do everything they
can to make it stick, suppressing what shreds of evidence can be
independently gathered.
2. If it's fake, than you should also expect cute little touches: designer
logos for publicity campaigns ready to launch at a moment's notice, be it
“Je suis Charlie” or that cute little Eiffel Tower inscribed in a peace
symbol. There weren't any props to go with the Russian jet disaster—unless
you count that tasteful Charlie Hebdo cartoon of a jihadi rocket having
anal sex with an airliner. There might also be a few traditional titbits
designed to feed a media frenzy, such as a fake passport found lying next
to one of the perpetrators—because when terrorists go on suicide missions
they always take their fake passports with them. The people who are charged
with designing these events lack imagination and usually just go with
whatever worked before.
We should certainly expect there to be more fake massacres of this
sort—whenever the political situation becomes sufficiently fraught to call
for one—because at this point ready-to-go jihadi terrorist cells are
something of a sunk cost and can be deployed very cheaply and effectively.
Of course we should grieve for the victims, but there is something far more
important at stake than mere human lives, which are, deplorably, becoming
cheaper with each passing year. We should grieve for the truth.

front pages of all NYC newspapers and on Channel 4 in Europe. I tried to

the world's greatest hackers just like they are, then YOU can neutralize
any garbage they place on the BIOS Chip. Kaspersky by refusing to help me
in this also SUPPORTS NSA placement of virus software on the BIOS Chip
because that confirms that I am one of the capitalists' most important
enemies and therefore I am an are automatic enemy of Kaspersky. So I can go

So France again demonstrates they are America's lapdogs:

for hitting moderate Syrian opposition forces, which they said only
bolster President Bashar al-Assad’s government. Hollande would not
provide a date for Assad’s transition from power but said it must be
“as soon as possible.” "
Perhaps France would like to name, identify and locate the "moderate"
terrorists/ "rebels" (as Putin has asked for on multiple occasions)
and explain to the world how beheadings, and a machine gun shooting of
a pilot parachuting for his life, somehow constitute "moderate"
France - sadly no friend of principle or truth these days.
Again, almost all prominent politicians these days appear to be
utterly compromised, -and- beholden to USA's interests - France no
less than anyone else.
Again I say, Russian president Putin is close to the only true
statesmen on the world stage today. He has brought Russia back from
the absolute brink of total collapse after Yeltsin and Gorbachev, and
consistently matches his and Russia's actions with his words and vice
versa - the very definition of integrity (for those who have yet to do

stupidity a small proportion of all such compromised behaviour).
I am grateful that there is at least one leader of a major nation who

*FBI can demand web history, phone location data without a warrant*
The FBI can use national security letters (NSLs) to force companies to turn
over sensitive user data without a warrant, according to filings.
By Zack Whittaker for Zero Day  | November 30, 2015 --
16:35 GMT (08:35 PST) | Topic: Security
The FBI can compel companies and individuals to turn over vast sums of
personal data without a warrant, it has been revealed for the first time.
In a case that's lasted more than a decade, a court filing released Monday
 showed how the
FBI used secret interpretations to determine the scope of national security
letters (NSLs).
Nicholas Merrill, founder of internet provider Calyx Internet Access, who
brought the 11-year-old case to court after his company was served a
national security letter, won the case earlier this year.
National security letters are almost always bundled with a gag order,
preventing Merrill from speaking freely about the letter he received.
While it was known that national security letters can demand customer and
user data, it wasn't known exactly what.
In a statement on Monday, Merrill revealed the FBI has used its authority
to force companies and individuals to turn over complete web browsing
history; the IP addresses of everyone a person has corresponded with;
online purchase information, and also cell-site location information, which
he said can be used to turn a person's phone into a "location tracking
According to a release ,
the FBI can also force a company to release postal addresses, email
addresses, and "any other information which [is] considered to be an
electronic communication transactional record."
Merrill said in remarks: "The FBI has interpreted its NSL authority to
encompass the websites we read, the web searches we conduct, the people we
contact, and the places we go. This kind of data reveals the most intimate
details of our lives, including our political activities, religious
affiliations, private relationships, and even our private thoughts and
Federal district judge Victor Marrero described in his decision that the
FBI's position was "extreme and overly broad."
He also found that the FBI's overbroad gag order on Mr. Merrill "implicates
serious issues, both with respect to the First Amendment and accountability
of the government to the people."
Merrill is the first person who has succeeded in completely lifting a
national security letter gag order.
The Patriot Act expanded the reach of national security letters when it was
signed into law a month after the September 11 attacks in 2001.
More than ten thousand national security letters are issued by the FBI
every year, without a warrant or judicial oversight.
These letters have been surrounded with controversy for years, leading to
many unsuccessful attempts to litigate against them. Major companies,
including Google
have challenged national security letters, with little luck. Microsoft
recently challenged an order, which led to the FBI to withdraw the demand
In 2008, a US court found the National Security Letter statute, amended by
the Patriot Act in 2001, was unconstitutional.
In a separate case in 2013, the gag order provision was found to be in
breach of the First Amendment
The government appealed the ruling.

and remains a heinous and appalling crime for which the real culprits must

facts, which in these increasing numbers of "terrorist-attacks" do not fit
the "official" narrative or do not match the fake news-blasts of the
masterminded mainstream media, nor can we close our ears from the likewise

*A Most Convenient MassacreWhat a difference a single massacre can make!By
Dmitry Orlov*
November 17, 2015 "Information Clearing House" -  Just a week ago the EU
couldn't possibly figure out anything to do to stop the influx of
“refugees” from all those countries the US and NATO had bombed into
oblivion. But now, because “Paris changed everything,” EU's borders are
being locked down and refugees are being turned back.
• Just a week ago it seemed that the EU was going to be swamped by
resurgent nationalism, with incumbent political parties poised to get voted
out of power. But now, thanks to the Paris massacre, they have obtained a
new lease on life, because they can now safely embrace the same policies
that a week ago they branded as “fascist.”
• Just a week ago the EU and the US couldn't possibly bring themselves
admit that they are utterly incompetent when it comes to combating their
own creation—ISIS, that is—and need Russian help. But now, at the
après-Paris G-20 summit, everybody is ready to line up and let Putin take
charge of the war against terrorism. Look—the Americans finally found those
convoys of tanker trucks stretching beyond the horizon that ISIS has been
using to smuggle out stolen Syrian crude oil—after Putin showed them the
satellite photos!
Am I being crass and insensitive? Not at all—I deplore all the deaths from
terrorist attacks in Iraq, in Syria, in Lebanon, and in all the other
countries whose populations did absolutely nothing to deserve such
treatment. I only feel half as bad about the French, who stood by quietly
as their military helped destroy Libya (which did nothing to deserve it).

*FBI can demand web history, phone location data without a warrant*
The FBI can use national security letters (NSLs) to force companies to turn
over sensitive user data without a warrant, according to filings.
By Zack Whittaker for Zero Day  | November 30, 2015 --
16:35 GMT (08:35 PST) | Topic: Security
The FBI can compel companies and individuals to turn over vast sums of
personal data without a warrant, it has been revealed for the first time.
In a case that's lasted more than a decade, a court filing released Monday
 showed how the
FBI used secret interpretations to determine the scope of national security
letters (NSLs).
Nicholas Merrill, founder of internet provider Calyx Internet Access, who
brought the 11-year-old case to court after his company was served a
national security letter, won the case earlier this year.
National security letters are almost always bundled with a gag order,
preventing Merrill from speaking freely about the letter he received.
While it was known that national security letters can demand customer and
user data, it wasn't known exactly what.
In a statement on Monday, Merrill revealed the FBI has used its authority
to force companies and individuals to turn over complete web browsing
history; the IP addresses of everyone a person has corresponded with;
online purchase information, and also cell-site location information, which
he said can be used to turn a person's phone into a "location tracking
According to a release ,
the FBI can also force a company to release postal addresses, email
addresses, and "any other information which [is] considered to be an
electronic communication transactional record."
Merrill said in remarks: "The FBI has interpreted its NSL authority to
encompass the websites we read, the web searches we conduct, the people we
contact, and the places we go. This kind of data reveals the most intimate
details of our lives, including our political activities, religious
affiliations, private relationships, and even our private thoughts and
Federal district judge Victor Marrero described in his decision that the
FBI's position was "extreme and overly broad."
He also found that the FBI's overbroad gag order on Mr. Merrill "implicates
serious issues, both with respect to the First Amendment and accountability
of the government to the people."
Merrill is the first person who has succeeded in completely lifting a
national security letter gag order.
The Patriot Act expanded the reach of national security letters when it was
signed into law a month after the September 11 attacks in 2001.
More than ten thousand national security letters are issued by the FBI
every year, without a warrant or judicial oversight.
These letters have been surrounded with controversy for years, leading to
many unsuccessful attempts to litigate against them. Major companies,
including Google
have challenged national security letters, with little luck. Microsoft
recently challenged an order, which led to the FBI to withdraw the demand
In 2008, a US court found the National Security Letter statute, amended by
the Patriot Act in 2001, was unconstitutional.
In a separate case in 2013, the gag order provision was found to be in
breach of the First Amendment
The government appealed the ruling.

after the events in Paris by whomsoever. Their violent death certainly was
and remains a heinous and appalling crime for which the real culprits must
be brought to true justice.But, we can also not close our eyes from seeing
facts, which in these increasing numbers of "terrorist-attacks" do not fit
the "official" narrative or do not match the fake news-blasts of the

of the population remaining behind suffer without any genuine help in
*A Most Convenient MassacreWhat a difference a single massacre can make!By
Dmitry Orlov*
November 17, 2015 "Information Clearing House" -  Just a week ago the EU
couldn't possibly figure out anything to do to stop the influx of
“refugees” from all those countries the US and NATO had bombed into
oblivion. But now, because “Paris changed everything,” EU's borders are
being locked down and refugees are being turned back.
• Just a week ago it seemed that the EU was going to be swamped by
resurgent nationalism, with incumbent political parties poised to get voted
out of power. But now, thanks to the Paris massacre, they have obtained a
new lease on life, because they can now safely embrace the same policies
that a week ago they branded as “fascist.”
• Just a week ago the EU and the US couldn't possibly bring themselves
admit that they are utterly incompetent when it comes to combating their
own creation—ISIS, that is—and need Russian help. But now, at the
après-Paris G-20 summit, everybody is ready to line up and let Putin take
charge of the war against terrorism. Look—the Americans finally found those
convoys of tanker trucks stretching beyond the horizon that ISIS has been
using to smuggle out stolen Syrian crude oil—after Putin showed them the
satellite photos!
Am I being crass and insensitive? Not at all—I deplore all the deaths from
terrorist attacks in Iraq, in Syria, in Lebanon, and in all the other
countries whose populations did absolutely nothing to deserve such
treatment. I only feel half as bad about the French, who stood by quietly
as their military helped destroy Libya (which did nothing to deserve it).
*Note that after the Russian jet crashed in the Sinai there weren't all
that many Facebook avatars with the Russian flag pasted over them, and
hardly any candlelight vigils or piles of wreaths and flowers in various
Western capitals. I even detected a whiff of smug satisfaction that the
Russians got their comeuppance for stepping out of line in Syria.Why the
difference in reaction? Simple: you were told to grieve for the French, so
you did. You were not told to grieve for the Russians, and so you didn't.
Don't feel bad; you are just following orders. The reasoning behind these
orders is transparent: the French, along with the rest of the EU, are
Washington's willing puppets; therefore, they are innocent, and when they
get killed, it's a tragedy. But the Russians are not Washington's willing
puppet, and are not innocent, and so when they get killed by terrorists,
it's punishment. And when Iraqis, or Syrians, or Nigerians get killed by
terrorists, that's not a tragedy either, for a different reason: they are
too poor to matter. In order to qualify as a victim of a tragedy, you have
to be each of these three things: 1. a US-puppet, 2. rich and 3. dead.*
Also, you probably believe that the terrorist attacks in Paris were the
genuine article—nobody knew it would happen, and it couldn't have been
stopped, because these terrorists are just too clever for the ubiquitous
state surveillance to detect. Don't feel bad about that either; you are
just believing what you are told to believe. You probably also believe that
jet fuel can melt steel girders and that skyscrapers collapse into their
own footprints (whether they've been hit by airplanes or not). You can
certainly believe whatever you like, but here are a couple of
easy-to-understand tips on telling what's real from what's fake:
1. If it's fake, the perpetrators are known immediately (and sometimes
beforehand). If it's real, then the truth is uncovered as a result of a
thorough investigation. So, for instance, on 9/11 the guilty party were a
bunch of Saudis armed with box cutters (some of whom are, paradoxically,
still alive). And in Paris we knew right away that this was done by
ISIS—even before we knew who the perpetrators were. And when that Malaysian
jet got shot down over Ukraine, we knew right away that it was the
Russians' fault (never mind that on that day the Ukrainians deployed an air
defense system, and also scrambled a couple of jets armed with air-to-air
missiles— against an enemy that doesn't have an air force). Note, however,
how we still don't know what happened with the Russian jet over Sinai (the
article was written on November 17, 2015 - before the Russian investigation
revealed the ISIS bomb in the jet). That case is still under
investigation—as it should be. If it's real, officials stall for time and
urge caution while scrambling to find out what happened. When it's fake,
the officials are ready to go with the Big Lie, and then do everything they
can to make it stick, suppressing what shreds of evidence can be
independently gathered.
2. If it's fake, than you should also expect cute little touches: designer
logos for publicity campaigns ready to launch at a moment's notice, be it
“Je suis Charlie” or that cute little Eiffel Tower inscribed in a peace
symbol. There weren't any props to go with the Russian jet disaster—unless
you count that tasteful Charlie Hebdo cartoon of a jihadi rocket having
anal sex with an airliner. There might also be a few traditional titbits
designed to feed a media frenzy, such as a fake passport found lying next
to one of the perpetrators—because when terrorists go on suicide missions
they always take their fake passports with them. The people who are charged
with designing these events lack imagination and usually just go with
whatever worked before.
We should certainly expect there to be more fake massacres of this
sort—whenever the political situation becomes sufficiently fraught to call
for one—because at this point ready-to-go jihadi terrorist cells are
something of a sunk cost and can be deployed very cheaply and effectively.
Of course we should grieve for the victims, but there is something far more
important at stake than mere human lives, which are, deplorably, becoming
cheaper with each passing year. We should grieve for the truth.

** was originally by William H. Depperman ​​whd2 at columbia.edu
 to the tor list.*
Hi Mailing List People,
            I am apparently  the number one person in the United States on
the _*NSA-CIA-FBI Watch List*_. For multiple reasons! I am the Coordinator
of the United Front Against Racism and Capitalism-Imperialism who was
arrested by the so-called "Major Case Squad" in August 1986 because our
group exposed the scientific documentation on a big series of _/*huge*/_
wall posters that AIDS is Biological Warfare by the US Government Against
Blacks, Gays and those with certain blood dyscrasias. The arrest was on the
front pages of all NYC newspapers and on Channel 4 in Europe. I tried to
send this email to Anonymous and TOR does not permit attachments so just
disregard that when you see an attachment mentioned.
            Recently I was _*Extraordinarily Renditioned*_ (KIDNAPPED AND
HELD AGAINST MY WILL FOR 18 HOURS AND TORTURED after simply walking along a
road in New Jersey!) See the third attachment. The NSA has TOTAL control of
my computer and has real time keystroke by keystroke monitoring and
harassment while I am on the computer. My anti-virus and anti-Malware are
totally useless as explained by Snowden because the computer is controlled
through the _*BIOS Chip*_ as explained in the attachment on Snowden
revelations. Scroll down the document until you get to _*ANT*_ (Access
Network Technology). I would like for _*Anonymous*_ to publish on its
website for EVERYONE, not just me,  how to remove and neutralize NSA
viruses placed on the BIOS CHIP! Also please send the information in an
email to me. I am sure you could manage this. If THEY can do it and YOU are
the world's greatest hackers just like they are, then YOU can neutralize
any garbage they place on the BIOS Chip. Kaspersky by refusing to help me
in this also SUPPORTS NSA placement of virus software on the BIOS Chip
because that confirms that I am one of the capitalists' most important
enemies and therefore I am an are automatic enemy of Kaspersky. So I can go
screw! Will I receive the same response from Anonymous? It is a rule of
capitalist statecraft that a government control and operate its own
opposition by one means or another any and ALL means. Anonymous is a
supposed opposition group. So who is _/*really*/_ running anonymous and
please do not say "everyone" or "no one" because that is the same BS answer
given by the anti-Communist Anarchist group,  so-called "Occupy Wall
Street." _*I need immediate help*_. And so undoubtedly do others! I am
partially computer savvy. But I am not yet a programmer.

In presenting a recent report on human rights issues, US Secretary of State
John Kerry stated: *“Here is the truth, we believe: A government that fails

little to boast about, to teach, and very little indeed in the way of

This report itself is heavily weighted in terms of naming Asian and Middle

The United States is not named in the report.
However, the US is itself a major culpable actor in such abuses. Despite
its continuing and increasingly strained efforts to self-promote as a
defender of human rights, the US is now inhibiting media and internet
freedom as well as regularly imprisoning activists–often without trial.

*You Mean I Forgot to Tell You About Your Trial?*
Tim Lahrman is a name well known to disability rights activists. A trained
paralegal, Tim has been volunteering his paralegal skills to a growing list
of people who are engaged in legal battles against guardians and lawyers.
For those unacquainted with the issues concerning adult guardianships, an
overview reveals that these guardianships constitute a legal loophole
through which an individual may be declared incompetent and then stripped
of all his assets and the lion’s share of his rights. In fact, upon the
initiation of such a guardianship, the alleged incapacitated person may not
even be allowed to hire a lawyer to defend against the guardianship. The
National Association to Stop Guardian Abuse’s website has a compelling
summary of what rights are lost when one goes under a guardianship
Robin Gibson, a Los Angeles woman, attributes Tim Lahrman’s legal expertise
to the successful resolution of an ongoing legal conflict with the guardian
for her mother.  Recently, the mother was released from a guardianship
which Gibson states was draining her mother’s estate and wherein the
guardian, Frumeh Labow
, had
virtually sequestered the older woman from contact with the outside world.
*“I owe this all to Tim,“* pronounced an exhilarated Robin Gibson in a
recent interview. *“I have finally got my mother back.“*
Gibson is only one of many who have benefited from Lahrman’s legal acumen
and skills. And she may be one of the last. For Tim Lahrman now sits in an
Indiana jail cell, held without bail on two seventeen year- old misdemeanor
Candice Schwager, an attorney from Texas, has this to say about Lahrman’s
incarceration:  *“There is an entirely different agenda behind this
seventeen year old persecution. It’s not even reasonable to think that
Goshen keeps misdemeanor cold case files and this was bad luck. This arrest
was retribution because Tim has brought up the crimes of a clouted
political figure.”*
Tim Lahrman was himself placed under a guardianship in 1987. He was at that
point in time in his twenties and an owner of a thriving automotive
business which was subsequently ravaged through the guardianship
Lahrman’s guardianship was never legally terminated. After sacking his
business, the guardian, Kenneth Scheibenberger, “just sort of wandered
off,” according to Lahrman.
This left Tim Lahrman in legal limbo. Neither his rights nor his property
were ever restored to him. He was left, in essence, as a legal zero.
As the law states, Lahrman thus could not have had the “legal capacity” to
commit the two misdemeanors with which he was charged in 1999 —driving with
a suspended license and possession of a small amount of marijuana.
Tim filed legal notice in the misdemeanor case of his stated “lack of
capacity.” The court took no notice and, after oddly failing in its legal
mandate to summon him for his trial, held the trial without him present,
found him guilty and sentenced him to two years. He was not present at the
hearing and was not subsequently apprehended.
Fast forward to 2016. Tim is not only assisting others in their
guardianship cases but has now filed a number of lawsuits in his own matter
Filed on January 20, 2015 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Indiana, South Bend Division, Tim Lahrman also sued Elkhart
County Superior Court No. 2 (Stephen R. Bowers, Judge), the Chief Judge of
the Indiana Court of Appeals, the State of Indiana, the Office of Indiana
Attorney General and the Indiana Supreme Court Division of State Court
Administration. Lahrman was picked up in March of this year on the
seventeen year- old stale and expired warrant, and is being held in Elkhart
County Jail without bail. His writ of Habeas Corpus, filed with the court
this past week, was reportedly denied by Judge Bodie Stegelmann. According
to reports, Judge Stegelmann has ordered Lahrman into a psychiatric
Attorney Schwager, who has filed notice in this case, states that Tim was
put into “the hole”—solitary confinement—this past week after asking his
public defender for her name and also requesting the court file. The
request apparently frightened her. Schwager has more
the case.
The public defender subsequently withdrew and the judge has ordered Tim to
appear pro se—without legal counsel.
*I Don’t Know You But I Am Sure You Are Incompetent*
Another disability rights activist, Cary Andrew Crittenden, is now being
held in Santa Clara County Jail, in Northern California, after being
arrested on Christmas Eve on “secret charges.”
We can only term the charges “secret” because the Santa Clara County
Prosecutor’s office has consistently refused to honor its legal
responsibility to release the records containing the factual circumstances
surrounding Crittenden’s arrest. The California Public Records Act,
clarified by the court case known as “Kusar” mandates the release of these
Crittenden, who has launched an internet campaign against corruption in
Santa Clara County was previously arrested in Santa Clara County for making
online statements about public officials which were deemed to be “
An internal affairs complaint was filed on February 11 with the
Prosecutor’s office concerning the refusal of Assistant District Attorney
David Angel to comply with the records disclosure law, which is in place in
order to guard against “secret arrests.” This IA complaint appears to have
gone the way of the public’s rights to know—into the garbage can. No action
has been taken on the complaint.
The recipient of the complaint, a Lt. Jorge Perez, who states he is an
investigator with the DA’s office, has refused to even release the name of
the individual who has been assigned to investigate the complaint
concerning ADA David Angel’s refusal to comply with the law.
Recently, there was an attempt to have Crittenden declared incompetent to
stand trial. If an individual is so deemed, he may be incarcerated
indefinitely without ever having his day in court. Sniffing this rat,
Crittenden refused to attend the psychiatric evaluation which the court had
set up for him.
In a bizarre, Kafkaesque effort, a “doctor” –who never saw or evaluated
Cary Andrew Crittenden–trotted himself into court. In a declaration that
would have made any surrealist proud, Dr. Burke, the “doc-in the pocket” of
the court, intoned that in his professional opinion, Crittenden, a man he
had never seen, was “incompetent to stand trial.”
The fact that Burke had never evaluated Crittenden did not escape the
attention of the court, however. Crittenden was ordered into another
evaluation, and the subsequent medical professional reportedly determined
that Crittenden was indeed competent.
The propensity for courts now to order activists and dissidents into
psychiatric evaluation is something that deserves special attention. A
person adjudicated incompetent by a court may, in fact, never get a trial.
He can be locked up indefinitely on minor and potentially bogus charges and
also be court- ordered to be forcibly  medicated with anti- psychotics,
which constitute a chemical strait jacket.
If you think that the cases involving Lahrman and Crittenden are the
exception, you may rest assured that, for cases involving guardianship
activists, this is standard court operating procedure. Rosanna Miller, who
was attempting to protect her father’s interests while he was under
guardianship, was arrested in 2014 for failure to pay court costs. The Ohio
Supreme Court, however, had issued a memo stating that an individual cannot
be arrested for failure to pay court costs.
Questions were raised about the possibility that the Bellafontaine judge,
Ann Beck, was involved in a number of financial improprieties. Beck then
quickly released Miller from custody. Barbara Stone, a NY attorney whose
mother, Helen, was under a questionable guardianship in Florida, was
arrested and charged with “custody interference”—which mandates a potential
sentence of five years in prison—for allegedly taking her mother to lunch.
*If I Can’t Get You, I’ll Get Your Kid*
The psychiatric incarceration of John Rohrer raises further questions about
motives to detain this young man, and detain him possibly indefinitely.
Rohrer, who apparently wandered into the wrong house while under the
influence of a hallucinogen, has now been detained over ten years, the last
six and a half years as an in-patient in a state psychiatric facility. The
case has been fraught with illegal maneuvers by the prosecutors and judge,
including denying him his right multiple times to hearings to determine
whether he meets the state’s definition of being “mentally ill.” In fact,
Rohrer has never been deemed incompetent. Rohrer is now being held at
Appalachian Behavioral Healthcare, a State psychiatric hospital, where he
was forcibly drugged for years.
It should be noted that the Ohio Supreme Court has determined that a judge
may not order forced drugging unless he makes a finding that the individual
lacks capacity to consent. The forced drugging must also be in the
patient’s “best interests” and there must not be any alternatives deemed to
be as effective as the drugging. In the Rohrer case, Judge Corzine made
none of these findings, and in fact stated on the record that Rohrer
appeared “pretty lucid today.”
Nevertheless, Corzine ordered the forced drugging of John Rohrer.
According to reports, during a brief 2007 exposure to Risperdal, Rohrer,
who was at that time 27 years old, suffered a cardiac event, but this did
not stop it from being chosen as the primary drug to forcibly inject.
Medical and legal malpractice complaints were filed November 24, 2014 in
the Ohio Court of Claims and November 28, 2014 in the Franklin County
Common Pleas Court by the attorney for John Rohrer. The complaint states
that Rohrer was forcibly injected with Risperdal for more than 3 ½ years
although the drug is known to cause irreversible brain damage. In addition,
the complaint states that Rohrer’s rights to a fair hearing have been
repeatedly violated.
The activist in the Rohrer case is actually his mother. Attorney and talk
show host Katherine Hine founded the advocacy group Stop Child Abuse Now in
Oklahoma and advised a group of foster mothers who were outraged at the
involvement of judges and lawyers in the murder of 2 year old Ryan Luke in
1995. She is the Executive Director of the Ross County Network for Children
in Ohio, an organization with a strong history of conflict with the Ross
County Prosecutors, surrounding two child murderers that the County had not
wanted prosecuted back in the 1990’s.
Hine is now with WJLA radio hosting a two weekly broadcasts—one exposing
illegalities of forced psychiatry and another exposing the consequences of
the lack of judicial accountability. She also is a contributor to The
Columbus Free Press.
The Ross County Prosecutor’s office has made it clear that they despise
her. Now, they are the ones making sure John Rohrer stays locked up.
Hine has faced three disciplinary actions.  She writes, “My first
discipline was in Oklahoma in like 1981 or 1982 when my soon to be ex
grabbed by children in violation of an Oklahoma custody order giving their
temporary custody to me.” According to Hine, “He claimed he wasn’t served.”
She reports that “I got a private reprimand – where you go into an office
and they yell at you about 15 minutes.  Told me what a disgrace to the
profession I was and how ashamed they all were of being in the bar
association with me.”
She was subsequently reprimanded by the Oklahoma Bar in 1997 for
communicating with a judge concerning a matter involving a suspected case
of child abuse, in which she did not represent a party
. In
fact, Hine had signed a letter along with seven other individuals who were
concerned that the judge had authorized supervised visitation of a child
with a sexual predator and that the supervision stipulation was being
ignored. In other words, the child was allowed to be alone with the
predator. There was another attempt at discipline when she was accused of
ghost writing for a pro se litigant, but Hine invoked confidentiality and
the complaint evaporated.
Concerning the lengthy incarceration of her son, Katherine Hine has this to
say: “These people are like the Cosa Nostra. They launch intergenerational
vendettas and will go after your family.”
According to Hine, John Rohrer is no longer allowed online. He had
previously set up websites with his music and poetry but the public
awareness of his situation had launched protests among his readers and as a
result, he is now barred by the hospital from going onto the internet.
Recent articles have discussed the increasing incidence of suspension and
disciplinary actions taken against attorneys who are attempting to protect
the rights of individuals
. If
the current trend continues, we may see anyone standing up for the rights
of another individual escorted into jail and, from there, potentially into
a rubber room.

In the 60's/70's it was "the communist threat/spying for the bloody
russians", now it's "child porn/terrrrorism"... they change their masks
(that always seem so "beautiful"), BUT they can't change their ugly faces.
As to the crypto theme - we knew from the beginning of all this shit about
pseudo war on terror/pedophiles -vs- privacy -> that this is what gonna
happen. And that's only the beginning.

The Management of Dissent: How to Destroy an Activist
By Janet Phelan While the West, and the United States in particular, has repeatedly voiced
criticism over human rights abuses in other countries, the US’s own record
in terms of detaining and incarcerating dissidents is now becoming
In presenting a recent report on human rights issues, US Secretary of State
John Kerry stated: *“Here is the truth, we believe: A government that fails
to respect human rights, no matter how lofty its pretentions, has very
little to boast about, to teach, and very little indeed in the way of
reaching its full potential
.” *
This report itself is heavily weighted in terms of naming Asian and Middle
Eastern countries as human rights abusers. Kerry reports that *“In every
part of the world, we see an accelerating trend by both state and non-state
actors to close the space for civil society, to stifle media and Internet
freedom, to marginalize opposition voices, and in the most extreme cases,
to kill people or drive them from their homes
.” *
The United States is not named in the report.
However, the US is itself a major culpable actor in such abuses. Despite
its continuing and increasingly strained efforts to self-promote as a
defender of human rights, the US is now inhibiting media and internet
freedom as well as regularly imprisoning activists–often without trial.
The world is already aware of the use of the Espionage Act to imprison and
otherwise intimidate whistleblowers. The cases of Bradley Manning
, Jeffrey Sterline
,  James Hitselberger
,      John
Kiriakou ,   and
others have hit the mainstream press
What the world may not be aware of is that non-CIA connected individuals,
who are merely attempting to correct and/ or broadcast injustices, are now
facing jail time.
*You Mean I Forgot to Tell You About Your Trial?*
Tim Lahrman is a name well known to disability rights activists. A trained
paralegal, Tim has been volunteering his paralegal skills to a growing list
of people who are engaged in legal battles against guardians and lawyers.
For those unacquainted with the issues concerning adult guardianships, an
overview reveals that these guardianships constitute a legal loophole
through which an individual may be declared incompetent and then stripped
of all his assets and the lion’s share of his rights. In fact, upon the
initiation of such a guardianship, the alleged incapacitated person may not
even be allowed to hire a lawyer to defend against the guardianship. The
National Association to Stop Guardian Abuse’s website has a compelling
summary of what rights are lost when one goes under a guardianship
Robin Gibson, a Los Angeles woman, attributes Tim Lahrman’s legal expertise
to the successful resolution of an ongoing legal conflict with the guardian
for her mother.  Recently, the mother was released from a guardianship
which Gibson states was draining her mother’s estate and wherein the
guardian, Frumeh Labow
, had
virtually sequestered the older woman from contact with the outside world.
*“I owe this all to Tim,“* pronounced an exhilarated Robin Gibson in a
recent interview. *“I have finally got my mother back.“*
Gibson is only one of many who have benefited from Lahrman’s legal acumen
and skills. And she may be one of the last. For Tim Lahrman now sits in an
Indiana jail cell, held without bail on two seventeen year- old misdemeanor
Candice Schwager, an attorney from Texas, has this to say about Lahrman’s
incarceration:  *“There is an entirely different agenda behind this
seventeen year old persecution. It’s not even reasonable to think that
Goshen keeps misdemeanor cold case files and this was bad luck. This arrest
was retribution because Tim has brought up the crimes of a clouted
political figure.”*
Tim Lahrman was himself placed under a guardianship in 1987. He was at that
point in time in his twenties and an owner of a thriving automotive
business which was subsequently ravaged through the guardianship
Lahrman’s guardianship was never legally terminated. After sacking his
business, the guardian, Kenneth Scheibenberger, “just sort of wandered
off,” according to Lahrman.
This left Tim Lahrman in legal limbo. Neither his rights nor his property
were ever restored to him. He was left, in essence, as a legal zero.
As the law states, Lahrman thus could not have had the “legal capacity” to
commit the two misdemeanors with which he was charged in 1999 —driving with
a suspended license and possession of a small amount of marijuana.
Tim filed legal notice in the misdemeanor case of his stated “lack of
capacity.” The court took no notice and, after oddly failing in its legal
mandate to summon him for his trial, held the trial without him present,
found him guilty and sentenced him to two years. He was not present at the
hearing and was not subsequently apprehended.
Fast forward to 2016. Tim is not only assisting others in their
guardianship cases but has now filed a number of lawsuits in his own matter
Filed on January 20, 2015 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern
District of Indiana, South Bend Division, Tim Lahrman also sued Elkhart
County Superior Court No. 2 (Stephen R. Bowers, Judge), the Chief Judge of
the Indiana Court of Appeals, the State of Indiana, the Office of Indiana
Attorney General and the Indiana Supreme Court Division of State Court
Administration. Lahrman was picked up in March of this year on the
seventeen year- old stale and expired warrant, and is being held in Elkhart
County Jail without bail. His writ of Habeas Corpus, filed with the court
this past week, was reportedly denied by Judge Bodie Stegelmann. According
to reports, Judge Stegelmann has ordered Lahrman into a psychiatric
Attorney Schwager, who has filed notice in this case, states that Tim was
put into “the hole”—solitary confinement—this past week after asking his
public defender for her name and also requesting the court file. The
request apparently frightened her. Schwager has more
the case.
The public defender subsequently withdrew and the judge has ordered Tim to
appear pro se—without legal counsel.
*I Don’t Know You But I Am Sure You Are Incompetent*
Another disability rights activist, Cary Andrew Crittenden, is now being
held in Santa Clara County Jail, in Northern California, after being
arrested on Christmas Eve on “secret charges.”
We can only term the charges “secret” because the Santa Clara County
Prosecutor’s office has consistently refused to honor its legal
responsibility to release the records containing the factual circumstances
surrounding Crittenden’s arrest. The California Public Records Act,
clarified by the court case known as “Kusar” mandates the release of these
Crittenden, who has launched an internet campaign against corruption in
Santa Clara County was previously arrested in Santa Clara County for making
online statements about public officials which were deemed to be “
An internal affairs complaint was filed on February 11 with the
Prosecutor’s office concerning the refusal of Assistant District Attorney
David Angel to comply with the records disclosure law, which is in place in
order to guard against “secret arrests.” This IA complaint appears to have
gone the way of the public’s rights to know—into the garbage can. No action
has been taken on the complaint.
The recipient of the complaint, a Lt. Jorge Perez, who states he is an
investigator with the DA’s office, has refused to even release the name of
the individual who has been assigned to investigate the complaint
concerning ADA David Angel’s refusal to comply with the law.
Recently, there was an attempt to have Crittenden declared incompetent to
stand trial. If an individual is so deemed, he may be incarcerated
indefinitely without ever having his day in court. Sniffing this rat,
Crittenden refused to attend the psychiatric evaluation which the court had
set up for him.
In a bizarre, Kafkaesque effort, a “doctor” –who never saw or evaluated
Cary Andrew Crittenden–trotted himself into court. In a declaration that
would have made any surrealist proud, Dr. Burke, the “doc-in the pocket” of
the court, intoned that in his professional opinion, Crittenden, a man he
had never seen, was “incompetent to stand trial.”
The fact that Burke had never evaluated Crittenden did not escape the
attention of the court, however. Crittenden was ordered into another
evaluation, and the subsequent medical professional reportedly determined
that Crittenden was indeed competent.
The propensity for courts now to order activists and dissidents into
psychiatric evaluation is something that deserves special attention. A
person adjudicated incompetent by a court may, in fact, never get a trial.
He can be locked up indefinitely on minor and potentially bogus charges and
also be court- ordered to be forcibly  medicated with anti- psychotics,
which constitute a chemical strait jacket.
If you think that the cases involving Lahrman and Crittenden are the
exception, you may rest assured that, for cases involving guardianship
activists, this is standard court operating procedure. Rosanna Miller, who
was attempting to protect her father’s interests while he was under
guardianship, was arrested in 2014 for failure to pay court costs. The Ohio
Supreme Court, however, had issued a memo stating that an individual cannot
be arrested for failure to pay court costs.
Questions were raised about the possibility that the Bellafontaine judge,
Ann Beck, was involved in a number of financial improprieties. Beck then
quickly released Miller from custody. Barbara Stone, a NY attorney whose
mother, Helen, was under a questionable guardianship in Florida, was
arrested and charged with “custody interference”—which mandates a potential
sentence of five years in prison—for allegedly taking her mother to lunch.
*If I Can’t Get You, I’ll Get Your Kid*
The psychiatric incarceration of John Rohrer raises further questions about
motives to detain this young man, and detain him possibly indefinitely.
Rohrer, who apparently wandered into the wrong house while under the
influence of a hallucinogen, has now been detained over ten years, the last
six and a half years as an in-patient in a state psychiatric facility. The
case has been fraught with illegal maneuvers by the prosecutors and judge,
including denying him his right multiple times to hearings to determine
whether he meets the state’s definition of being “mentally ill.” In fact,
Rohrer has never been deemed incompetent. Rohrer is now being held at
Appalachian Behavioral Healthcare, a State psychiatric hospital, where he
was forcibly drugged for years.
It should be noted that the Ohio Supreme Court has determined that a judge
may not order forced drugging unless he makes a finding that the individual
lacks capacity to consent. The forced drugging must also be in the
patient’s “best interests” and there must not be any alternatives deemed to
be as effective as the drugging. In the Rohrer case, Judge Corzine made
none of these findings, and in fact stated on the record that Rohrer
appeared “pretty lucid today.”
Nevertheless, Corzine ordered the forced drugging of John Rohrer.
According to reports, during a brief 2007 exposure to Risperdal, Rohrer,
who was at that time 27 years old, suffered a cardiac event, but this did
not stop it from being chosen as the primary drug to forcibly inject.
Medical and legal malpractice complaints were filed November 24, 2014 in
the Ohio Court of Claims and November 28, 2014 in the Franklin County
Common Pleas Court by the attorney for John Rohrer. The complaint states
that Rohrer was forcibly injected with Risperdal for more than 3 ½ years
although the drug is known to cause irreversible brain damage. In addition,
the complaint states that Rohrer’s rights to a fair hearing have been
repeatedly violated.
The activist in the Rohrer case is actually his mother. Attorney and talk
show host Katherine Hine founded the advocacy group Stop Child Abuse Now in
Oklahoma and advised a group of foster mothers who were outraged at the
involvement of judges and lawyers in the murder of 2 year old Ryan Luke in
1995. She is the Executive Director of the Ross County Network for Children
in Ohio, an organization with a strong history of conflict with the Ross
County Prosecutors, surrounding two child murderers that the County had not
wanted prosecuted back in the 1990’s.
Hine is now with WJLA radio hosting a two weekly broadcasts—one exposing
illegalities of forced psychiatry and another exposing the consequences of
the lack of judicial accountability. She also is a contributor to The
Columbus Free Press.
The Ross County Prosecutor’s office has made it clear that they despise
her. Now, they are the ones making sure John Rohrer stays locked up.
Hine has faced three disciplinary actions.  She writes, “My first
discipline was in Oklahoma in like 1981 or 1982 when my soon to be ex
grabbed by children in violation of an Oklahoma custody order giving their
temporary custody to me.” According to Hine, “He claimed he wasn’t served.”
She reports that “I got a private reprimand – where you go into an office
and they yell at you about 15 minutes.  Told me what a disgrace to the
profession I was and how ashamed they all were of being in the bar
association with me.”
She was subsequently reprimanded by the Oklahoma Bar in 1997 for
communicating with a judge concerning a matter involving a suspected case
of child abuse, in which she did not represent a party
. In
fact, Hine had signed a letter along with seven other individuals who were
concerned that the judge had authorized supervised visitation of a child
with a sexual predator and that the supervision stipulation was being
ignored. In other words, the child was allowed to be alone with the
predator. There was another attempt at discipline when she was accused of
ghost writing for a pro se litigant, but Hine invoked confidentiality and
the complaint evaporated.
Concerning the lengthy incarceration of her son, Katherine Hine has this to
say: “These people are like the Cosa Nostra. They launch intergenerational
vendettas and will go after your family.”
According to Hine, John Rohrer is no longer allowed online. He had
previously set up websites with his music and poetry but the public
awareness of his situation had launched protests among his readers and as a
result, he is now barred by the hospital from going onto the internet.
Recent articles have discussed the increasing incidence of suspension and
disciplinary actions taken against attorneys who are attempting to protect
the rights of individuals
. If
the current trend continues, we may see anyone standing up for the rights
of another individual escorted into jail and, from there, potentially into
a rubber room.

​Sci-Hub: Russian neuroscientist running 'Pirate Bay for scientists'
 - with 48 million free academic papers -
... to remove all barriers in the way of science
By Mary-Ann Russon  - February 15, 2016
A website illegally offering academic papers for download is fighting back
against a copyright infringement lawsuit in the US and has no intention of
giving up Sci-Hub
*knowledge to all*
*We fight inequality in knowledge access across the world. The scientific
knowledge should be available for every person regardless of their income,
social status, geographical location and etc.*
*Our mission is to remove any barrier which impeding the widest possible
distribution of knowledge in human society!*
Sci-Hub, a website dubbed the "Pirate Bay for scientists" by offering
peer-reviewed academic papers to download for free, is thumbing its nose at
copyright holders following an infringement lawsuit battle in the US.
Sci-Hub  is the brainchild of Alexandra Elbakyan, a
neuroscientist from Kazakhstan who is now based in Russia. When she was
writing her thesis in 2009, Elbakyan found it difficult to access the
research she needed to complete her work, as she needed to download many
papers, and each paper retailed for up to $30 (£21) each.
To get through her thesis, Elbakyan was forced to download pirated versions
of the academic papers for free, and eventually, after being introduced to
a website that enabled researchers to share and trade the academic papers
they needed with people who had paid for them, she decided to take the idea
further and create her own website around 2011 or 2012.
Tricking journals with university proxies
Today, the Sci-Hub website boasts 48 million academic papers and has now
gone viral, because it features technology similar to anonymising proxy
websites. Rather than just enabling users to search for and extract the
papers they need, the Sci-Hub website is programmed to automatically search
for papers on important topics and work out how to download them to its
database without spending a penny.
Since various universities in the world have paid subscriber access to
different premium journal services, the website is able to automatically
trawl through different university proxies to trick the relevant journal's
website into believing that the user accessing the academic paper has the
relevant credentials similar to a paying customer.
Once the paper is unlocked, Sci-Hub then downloads the paper to its
database and even looks for other missing papers on similar topics to
download, so that all the researcher has to do is initiate a search, and
the paper will come up, ready to be downloaded for nothing.
Apart from using Sci-Hub, the only way for researchers to gain access to
research papers without paying for them is to ask people they know, or post
on Twitter using the hashtag *Sued for copyright infringement and blocked in the US*
At its peak in 2015, the website received 80,000 visitors a day, according
to Nature magazine
and had become so popular that academic publisher Elsevier
 brought a copyright lawsuit against the
website, claiming that it had lost between $75,000 - $150,000 in revenue
due to the piracy.
On 28 October 2015, a New York district court found in favour of Elsevier
and placed a temporary injunction against Sci-Hub, as well as suspending
access to the website's Sci-Hub.org domain, which has caused visitor
numbers to drop to 30,000 a day. But other than that, not much else can be
done to physically stop Elbakyan as she has no US assets to forfeit nor is
she a US citizen, so, just like Pirate Bay's multiple domain names
she quickly moved the website to Sci-Hub.io, where it continues to be
freely accessible.
"There should be no obstacles to accessing knowledge, I believe," Elbakyan
told RT .
"[According to Article 27 of the United Nations Declaration of Human
Rights], everyone has the right to freely participate in the cultural life
of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement
and its benefits."
Moving to the Dark Web
Not only that, but Elbakyan has also moved Sci-Hub's servers onto the Dark
Web – a section of the internet not discoverable by conventional means,
such as through Google or other search engines or by directly entering a
website URL. This is where cybercriminals typically list illegal goods and
services like drugs, firearms and hackers-for-hire and using the Tor
anonymity network
as a cloak to protect their real identities.
Even better, there are a huge number of scientists in the world actively
supporting Sci-Hub and even posting YouTube tutorials on how to download
papers for free from  the
piracy portal, especially since revolting against Elsevier's high prices in
2012, with even Harvard University telling its staff that it could no
longer afford the journal price hikes
in the same year.
"Even if legal access to [Sci-Hub] is blocked, the user can still get in
through the TOR network and immediately gain access to all the articles,"
said Elbakyan. "However, we intend to fight for free access to all
information. After all, using TOR still provides obstacles."

​Sci-Hub: Russian neuroscientist running 'Pirate Bay for scientists'
 - with 48 million free academic papers -
... to remove all barriers in the way of science
By Mary-Ann Russon  - February 15, 2016
A website illegally offering academic papers for download is fighting back
against a copyright infringement lawsuit in the US and has no intention of
giving up Sci-Hub
*knowledge to all*
*We fight inequality in knowledge access across the world. The scientific
knowledge should be available for every person regardless of their income,
social status, geographical location and etc.*
*Our mission is to remove any barrier which impeding the widest possible
distribution of knowledge in human society!*
Sci-Hub, a website dubbed the "Pirate Bay for scientists" by offering
peer-reviewed academic papers to download for free, is thumbing its nose at
copyright holders following an infringement lawsuit battle in the US.
Sci-Hub  is the brainchild of Alexandra Elbakyan, a
neuroscientist from Kazakhstan who is now based in Russia. When she was
writing her thesis in 2009, Elbakyan found it difficult to access the
research she needed to complete her work, as she needed to download many
papers, and each paper retailed for up to $30 (£21) each.
To get through her thesis, Elbakyan was forced to download pirated versions
of the academic papers for free, and eventually, after being introduced to
a website that enabled researchers to share and trade the academic papers
they needed with people who had paid for them, she decided to take the idea
further and create her own website around 2011 or 2012.
Tricking journals with university proxies
Today, the Sci-Hub website boasts 48 million academic papers and has now
gone viral, because it features technology similar to anonymising proxy
websites. Rather than just enabling users to search for and extract the
papers they need, the Sci-Hub website is programmed to automatically search
for papers on important topics and work out how to download them to its
database without spending a penny.
Since various universities in the world have paid subscriber access to
different premium journal services, the website is able to automatically
trawl through different university proxies to trick the relevant journal's
website into believing that the user accessing the academic paper has the
relevant credentials similar to a paying customer.
Once the paper is unlocked, Sci-Hub then downloads the paper to its
database and even looks for other missing papers on similar topics to
download, so that all the researcher has to do is initiate a search, and
the paper will come up, ready to be downloaded for nothing.
Apart from using Sci-Hub, the only way for researchers to gain access to
research papers without paying for them is to ask people they know, or post
on Twitter using the hashtag *Sued for copyright infringement and blocked in the US*
At its peak in 2015, the website received 80,000 visitors a day, according
to Nature magazine
and had become so popular that academic publisher Elsevier
 brought a copyright lawsuit against the
website, claiming that it had lost between $75,000 - $150,000 in revenue
due to the piracy.
On 28 October 2015, a New York district court found in favour of Elsevier
and placed a temporary injunction against Sci-Hub, as well as suspending
access to the website's Sci-Hub.org domain, which has caused visitor
numbers to drop to 30,000 a day. But other than that, not much else can be
done to physically stop Elbakyan as she has no US assets to forfeit nor is
she a US citizen, so, just like Pirate Bay's multiple domain names
she quickly moved the website to Sci-Hub.io, where it continues to be
freely accessible.
"There should be no obstacles to accessing knowledge, I believe," Elbakyan
told RT .
"[According to Article 27 of the United Nations Declaration of Human
Rights], everyone has the right to freely participate in the cultural life
of the community, to enjoy the arts and to share in scientific advancement
and its benefits."
Moving to the Dark Web
Not only that, but Elbakyan has also moved Sci-Hub's servers onto the Dark
Web – a section of the internet not discoverable by conventional means,
such as through Google or other search engines or by directly entering a
website URL. This is where cybercriminals typically list illegal goods and
services like drugs, firearms and hackers-for-hire and using the Tor
anonymity network
as a cloak to protect their real identities.
Even better, there are a huge number of scientists in the world actively
supporting Sci-Hub and even posting YouTube tutorials on how to download
papers for free from  the
piracy portal, especially since revolting against Elsevier's high prices in
2012, with even Harvard University telling its staff that it could no
longer afford the journal price hikes
in the same year.
"Even if legal access to [Sci-Hub] is blocked, the user can still get in
through the TOR network and immediately gain access to all the articles,"
said Elbakyan. "However, we intend to fight for free access to all
information. After all, using TOR still provides obstacles."

Assertions of fact which I presume are not in dispute except perhaps by
schooled (and not educated) North Americans:
- North America/ the USA, has NO righteous authority to be the
  "policeman of the world"!
- The only authority the the USA has to be "the policeman of the world"
  is the predatorial right, the predatorial authority.
- The United States of America government is ethically bankrupt.
- The government of the USA has been co-opted by the North American (and
  western world oligarch controlled) Military Industrial Complex.
- The hegemonic intention of the government of the USA and the "neo
  conservatives" or war mongers of "the West", is a predatorial
  manifestion of the desire for empire, the desire to control the world.
      The hegemonic USA must end.
That said, here is what might be termed a human perspective of what an
average Russian living in Russia or perhaps the Donbas today, might
actually be experiencing, feeling and thinking, and why (historical
memories etc) - a somewhat moving piece for those so inclined:
"Why People Never Believe That War Is Coming – Until It Is Too Late"

The "terrorists" in Syria, aka IS or ISIS or ISIL, go into town,
villages and cities, forcing "conversion" or death upon those families
who live there.
The so called "terrorists" of eastern Ukraine in the Donbas/
Novorossia, are families fighting for their lives against the Ukraine
state army who are coming to "subdue" them, to "encourage" them to
accept the new Ukrainian coup government with its laws saying the
Russian language is no longer official, and no longer allowed to be
taught in their local schools, and many more abominations to "European
Oh, but it's all just "Russian aggression".
FFS, wake up European nations! wake up North Americans!
Absolutely the Ukrainian army must stop shooting and bombing its own

themselves against "their own" army shooting at them, their own

won’t. We will have pensions – they won’t. We will care for our children
and pensioners – they won’t. Our children will go to school, to
kindergartens – their children will sit in cellars. They don’t know how
to organize or do anything. This, ultimately, is how we will win this

"Someone explain to me so I can understand. How is it that Russia is
somehow negligent in influencing pro-Russian separatists in east
Ukraine, when the Kiev junta’s forces are the ones shelling civilians
daily? Does Germany’s Angela Merkel see something the world cannot? God
only knows."
                     All hail Ukraine!
   Home of the direct second and third generation Nazis!
We, the collective "West" are an absolute disgrace on this planet!!!!!
So YES if I were the USA president I would do better! The only real
challenge is doing better as USA president, and stopping yourself from
being killed for cleaning up the endless shit that is North American
foreign policy!

they torture our souls and killing our bodies. You see, it's not enough for
them just to torture (all of us) and kill (some of us). We should also
smile and welcome these actions.and trust them. Fucken INQUISITORS!*
*How can you, the government, speak to us like this?*
- dismantle the global monitoring infrastructure
- rapproach with Russia (the US MIC needs an enemy to maintain
- dismantle Ramstein Air Base
- respect China
- respect sovereignty of nations
- obtain permission from sovereign democratically elected governments
- respect international law
- respect the rule of law
It's a good start, USgov. Don't you think?

Zenaan wrote ... teared his chest apart and took out his heart, put it down

do we see? Such a superficial, stupid, arrogant comment.
Again. super-superficial super-boolshit that was written by a man without

Hope the "silent" readers are much much more "human" than this kind of

Zen, you swallowed their provocations which misled all the discussion
toward "putin VS us"/ oh, you misspelled my naaaame ;( / another bullshit
-> which is NOT the issue here at all. Reread your first-core comment/essay
which began all this thread and you'll see this total misdirection they
lead you to-> which you are swallowing here instead of ignoring.
You violated the balance (you know what i'm talking about) and all this
became a squash + vast lost of energy for you.
And here i will quote Jesus Christ:
*"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls
before swine"*
I want to protect you, so i write it to you (again) - STOP this
conversation. You wrote in a perfect manner your first essay/statement. The
others - Guninski's trollings/ AND almost empty OR MISleading comments by
others ... -> thus all this thread became casting pearls before pigs (and
those who are the pigs - know whom i'm talking about. and i'm not talking
only about those who write, but who read too).
*So... STOP. Please STOP, my precious friend.*
Take a contrast shower.
Go for a walk.
Listen to good music.
Read some good poetry/something abstract.

Take a good sleep.
Give some rest for your body and soul.
And try to be "quite" for a few days (at least).
You don't have the "duty" to answer ANY provocation/arrow/bullshit somebody
writes (and in many cases even good point).
You have a duty TO POINT something important out. And that's what you did
by opening this thread and writing from the depth of your heart. All the
rest is stupid loss of precious energy and feeding the conscious evil or

Let's play this game.
They said? Ok. I'll give you/everybody and example from my personal life:
They said? Oh, the old ladies downstairs also saying ... saying... i'm a
gay (some of them claim now a pervert one, oh, you know, slander always
evolves. and in Russia gay... is worse than a leprous)
*so WHY are they saying so?!*
a. They are really bored and evil. b. They SAW SOMETHING what they
distorted. 'cause they saw me one time "hugging some guy" (it was my
brother by the way whom i brought from the airport). AND? Am i a gay?!
'cause the whole building and many relatives of those old ladies are sure
AND say i'm a pervert gay. Ok, they say. But with your fucken logic, i am.
It's not that i have something against them, but *it's A LIE*. That's the
point here. *But people like you, who are "passioned" believe this shit
"without a trial" (a check with me, at least)*
by the way, God what a howl was one time when i played and laughed with one
of their grandchildren... that's the day i first heard this slander about
Back to your statement "So you're saying you'd do business with someone
that several people said robbed them?"-
I would check it by myself and not PREjudice the person beforehand. And
yes, i would do business with someone whom "many" people dislike/judge
before he himself proves me he is a fucker (or there was a fair trial).
2. Let an accused child molester be alone with your kids because they were
Sean, he was officially accused, but not convicted or.. you are talking
again about "rumors" and "sayings". If so, i don't give a damn shit about
those sayings.I, myself, not far away from getting this accusation too. And
based on what? Some hallucinations of old grannies with rotten mind?
*I claim that ONE CANNOT JUDGE THE OTHER UNLESS HE WAS PERSONALLY ASSAULTED
BY HIM/HER OR THAT PERSON WAS OFFICIALLY ACCUSED AND CONVICTED* (so yes,
there are very contradictive cases... but at least, this person was
officially accused if not convicted and we can inspect all the documents
and we know who are his accusers. that's the bare fucken *minimum*, not
that there were not thousands of fake cases, especially with women who
revenged their "ex man")
*And Appelbaum? *
You judge him by some fucken rumors - you said that yourself. Exactly like
all the parents of this building judged me by rumors created by old bitch
and are afraid to see kids near me. Not only there was no conviction in a
trial against Appelbaum, but NO EVEN ONE OFFICIAL ACCUSATION from those
"victims" (which is no problem to do, you know, but those fuckers don't
want to do *the bare minimum*, because they are afraid that the lie will
blow up in the police station sooner or later). *So for me, they are
SLANDERS. It's a SMEAR CAMPAIGN. Jake IS innocent. That's it.*
I am saying a fair trial. And not some fucken rumors.
And you are saying "rumors" -> thus Appelbaum/me/you are fucked up.
As i said, it's a way to inquisition trials. Which are based on no true
evidences, but rumors/feelings and in which you are guilty until proven
*And this is the ultimate EVIL.*

Assertions of fact which I presume are not in dispute except perhaps by
schooled (and not educated) North Americans:
- North America/ the USA, has NO righteous authority to be the
  "policeman of the world"!
- The only authority the the USA has to be "the policeman of the world"
  is the predatorial right, the predatorial authority.
- The United States of America government is ethically bankrupt.
- The government of the USA has been co-opted by the North American (and
  western world oligarch controlled) Military Industrial Complex.
- The hegemonic intention of the government of the USA and the "neo
  conservatives" or war mongers of "the West", is a predatorial
  manifestion of the desire for empire, the desire to control the world.
      The hegemonic USA must end.
That said, here is what might be termed a human perspective of what an
average Russian living in Russia or perhaps the Donbas today, might
actually be experiencing, feeling and thinking, and why (historical
memories etc) - a somewhat moving piece for those so inclined:
"Why People Never Believe That War Is Coming – Until It Is Too Late"
In Russian: In English:
A thought:
The "terrorists" in Syria, aka IS or ISIS or ISIL, go into town,
villages and cities, forcing "conversion" or death upon those families
who live there.
The so called "terrorists" of eastern Ukraine in the Donbas/
Novorossia, are families fighting for their lives against the Ukraine
state army who are coming to "subdue" them, to "encourage" them to
accept the new Ukrainian coup government with its laws saying the
Russian language is no longer official, and no longer allowed to be
taught in their local schools, and many more abominations to "European
Oh, but it's all just "Russian aggression".
FFS, wake up European nations! wake up North Americans!
Absolutely the Ukrainian army must stop shooting and bombing its own
Absolutely the eastern Ukrainian people have a right to defend
themselves against "their own" army shooting at them, their own
"president" Poroshenko "Donbas Children Will Sit in Cellars, “Ours” Will
Go to School":
Amazing Poroshenko Video: Keep Donbas Children "Holed Up" in ...
(well at least Poroshenko said it in a civilized setting - the Odessa
Opera House.)
Poroshenko: “we [in Ukraine] will have work they – [in the Donbas]
won’t. We will have pensions – they won’t. We will care for our children
and pensioners – they won’t. Our children will go to school, to
kindergartens – their children will sit in cellars. They don’t know how
to organize or do anything. This, ultimately, is how we will win this

"Someone explain to me so I can understand. How is it that Russia is
somehow negligent in influencing pro-Russian separatists in east
Ukraine, when the Kiev junta’s forces are the ones shelling civilians
daily? Does Germany’s Angela Merkel see something the world cannot? God
only knows."
                     All hail Ukraine!
   Home of the direct second and third generation Nazis!
We, the collective "West" are an absolute disgrace on this planet!!!!!

You quoted the relevant part, thank you. That part does not take much

So something is good, or potentially good - let's find out what:
In other words, the bill doesn't automatically affect the status quo of
existing websites (website certificates?) because, well who knows,
that's the current interpretation but tomorrow's interpretation can just

you are Facebook or Google (though the "going to jail" bit, if it were
possible, would be a good outcome for Facebook for example ... alas, I
And the determination of who has to hand over keys (i.e. who is a
"relevant operator") is nothing more than whatever the Home Secretary
(currently female it seems) says! Perhaps next week is her bad week of

issued and in person verified certificate provider keys etc) happens to

-> which is NOT the issue here at all. Reread your first-core comment/essay
which began all this thread and you'll see this total misdirection they
lead you to-> which you are swallowing here instead of ignoring.
You violated the balance (you know what i'm talking about) and all this
became a squash + vast lost of energy for you.
And here i will quote Jesus Christ:
*"Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye your pearls

I want to protect you, so i write it to you (again) - STOP this
conversation. You wrote in a perfect manner your first essay/statement. The
others - Guninski's trollings/ AND almost empty OR MISleading comments by
others ... -> thus all this thread became casting pearls before pigs (and
those who are the pigs - know whom i'm talking about. and i'm not talking

You have a duty TO POINT something important out. And that's what you did
by opening this thread and writing from the depth of your heart. All the

Let's play this game.
They said? Ok. I'll give you/everybody and example from my personal life:
They said? Oh, the old ladies downstairs also saying ... saying... i'm a
gay (some of them claim now a pervert one, oh, you know, slander always
evolves. and in Russia gay... is worse than a leprous)
*so WHY are they saying so?!*
a. They are really bored and evil. b. They SAW SOMETHING what they
distorted. 'cause they saw me one time "hugging some guy" (it was my
brother by the way whom i brought from the airport). AND? Am i a gay?!
'cause the whole building and many relatives of those old ladies are sure
AND say i'm a pervert gay. Ok, they say. But with your fucken logic, i am.
It's not that i have something against them, but *it's A LIE*. That's the
point here. *But people like you, who are "passioned" believe this shit
"without a trial" (a check with me, at least)*
by the way, God what a howl was one time when i played and laughed with one
of their grandchildren... that's the day i first heard this slander about
Back to your statement "So you're saying you'd do business with someone
that several people said robbed them?"-
I would check it by myself and not PREjudice the person beforehand. And
yes, i would do business with someone whom "many" people dislike/judge
before he himself proves me he is a fucker (or there was a fair trial).
2. Let an accused child molester be alone with your kids because they were
Sean, he was officially accused, but not convicted or.. you are talking
again about "rumors" and "sayings". If so, i don't give a damn shit about
those sayings.I, myself, not far away from getting this accusation too. And
based on what? Some hallucinations of old grannies with rotten mind?
*I claim that ONE CANNOT JUDGE THE OTHER UNLESS HE WAS PERSONALLY ASSAULTED
BY HIM/HER OR THAT PERSON WAS OFFICIALLY ACCUSED AND CONVICTED* (so yes,
there are very contradictive cases... but at least, this person was
officially accused if not convicted and we can inspect all the documents
and we know who are his accusers. that's the bare fucken *minimum*, not
that there were not thousands of fake cases, especially with women who
revenged their "ex man")
*And Appelbaum? *
You judge him by some fucken rumors - you said that yourself. Exactly like
all the parents of this building judged me by rumors created by old bitch
and are afraid to see kids near me. Not only there was no conviction in a
trial against Appelbaum, but NO EVEN ONE OFFICIAL ACCUSATION from those
"victims" (which is no problem to do, you know, but those fuckers don't
want to do *the bare minimum*, because they are afraid that the lie will
blow up in the police station sooner or later). *So for me, they are
SLANDERS. It's a SMEAR CAMPAIGN. Jake IS innocent. That's it.*
I am saying a fair trial. And not some fucken rumors.
And you are saying "rumors" -> thus Appelbaum/me/you are fucked up.
As i said, it's a way to inquisition trials. Which are based on no true
evidences, but rumors/feelings and in which you are guilty until proven
*And this is the ultimate EVIL.*

Assertions of fact which I presume are not in dispute except perhaps by
schooled (and not educated) North Americans:
- North America/ the USA, has NO righteous authority to be the
  "policeman of the world"!
- The only authority the the USA has to be "the policeman of the world"
  is the predatorial right, the predatorial authority.
- The United States of America government is ethically bankrupt.
- The government of the USA has been co-opted by the North American (and
  western world oligarch controlled) Military Industrial Complex.
- The hegemonic intention of the government of the USA and the "neo
  conservatives" or war mongers of "the West", is a predatorial
  manifestion of the desire for empire, the desire to control the world.
      The hegemonic USA must end.
That said, here is what might be termed a human perspective of what an
average Russian living in Russia or perhaps the Donbas today, might
actually be experiencing, feeling and thinking, and why (historical
memories etc) - a somewhat moving piece for those so inclined:
"Why People Never Believe That War Is Coming – Until It Is Too Late"
In Russian: In English:
A thought:
The "terrorists" in Syria, aka IS or ISIS or ISIL, go into town,
villages and cities, forcing "conversion" or death upon those families
who live there.
The so called "terrorists" of eastern Ukraine in the Donbas/
Novorossia, are families fighting for their lives against the Ukraine
state army who are coming to "subdue" them, to "encourage" them to
accept the new Ukrainian coup government with its laws saying the
Russian language is no longer official, and no longer allowed to be
taught in their local schools, and many more abominations to "European
Oh, but it's all just "Russian aggression".
FFS, wake up European nations! wake up North Americans!
Absolutely the Ukrainian army must stop shooting and bombing its own
Absolutely the eastern Ukrainian people have a right to defend
themselves against "their own" army shooting at them, their own
"president" Poroshenko "Donbas Children Will Sit in Cellars, “Ours” Will
Go to School":
Amazing Poroshenko Video: Keep Donbas Children "Holed Up" in ...
(well at least Poroshenko said it in a civilized setting - the Odessa
Opera House.)

won’t. We will have pensions – they won’t. We will care for our children
and pensioners – they won’t. Our children will go to school, to
kindergartens – their children will sit in cellars. They don’t know how
to organize or do anything. This, ultimately, is how we will win this

"Someone explain to me so I can understand. How is it that Russia is
somehow negligent in influencing pro-Russian separatists in east
Ukraine, when the Kiev junta’s forces are the ones shelling civilians

only knows."

You quoted the relevant part, thank you. That part does not take much

the bill may be massively opaque.

In other words, the bill doesn't automatically affect the status quo of
existing websites (website certificates?) because, well who knows,
that's the current interpretation but tomorrow's interpretation can just

you are Facebook or Google (though the "going to jail" bit, if it were
possible, would be a good outcome for Facebook for example ... alas, I
And the determination of who has to hand over keys (i.e. who is a
"relevant operator") is nothing more than whatever the Home Secretary
(currently female it seems) says! Perhaps next week is her bad week of
the month and your free speech website (nicely TLSed with personally
issued and in person verified certificate provider keys etc) happens to
have a discussion which pushes her (the Home Secretary's) trigger word

WTF? Am I misunderstanding something here?

You say that as though there are good points, see above.
Thanks for quoting the relevant part of the act, and letting us know
that the definitions for "relevant operator"s will be handed down extra-
judicially by the Home Secretary.

They said? Oh, the old ladies downstairs also saying ... saying... i'm a
gay (some of them claim now a pervert one, oh, you know, slander always
evolves. and in Russia gay... is worse than a leprous)
*so WHY are they saying so?!*
a. They are really bored and evil. b. They SAW SOMETHING what they
distorted. 'cause they saw me one time "hugging some guy" (it was my
brother by the way whom i brought from the airport). AND? Am i a gay?!
'cause the whole building and many relatives of those old ladies are sure
AND say i'm a pervert gay. Ok, they say. But with your fucken logic, i am.
It's not that i have something against them, but *it's A LIE*. That's the
point here. *But people like you, who are "passioned" believe this shit
"without a trial" (a check with me, at least)*
by the way, God what a howl was one time when i played and laughed with one

that several people said robbed them?"-
I would check it by myself and not PREjudice the person beforehand. And
yes, i would do business with someone whom "many" people dislike/judge
before he himself proves me he is a fucker (or there was a fair trial).
2. Let an accused child molester be alone with your kids because they were
Sean, he was officially accused, but not convicted or.. you are talking
again about "rumors" and "sayings". If so, i don't give a damn shit about
those sayings.I, myself, not far away from getting this accusation too. And
based on what? Some hallucinations of old grannies with rotten mind?
*I claim that ONE CANNOT JUDGE THE OTHER UNLESS HE WAS PERSONALLY ASSAULTED
BY HIM/HER OR THAT PERSON WAS OFFICIALLY ACCUSED AND CONVICTED* (so yes,
there are very contradictive cases... but at least, this person was
officially accused if not convicted and we can inspect all the documents
and we know who are his accusers. that's the bare fucken *minimum*, not
that there were not thousands of fake cases, especially with women who
revenged their "ex man")
*And Appelbaum? *
You judge him by some fucken rumors - you said that yourself. Exactly like
all the parents of this building judged me by rumors created by old bitch
and are afraid to see kids near me. Not only there was no conviction in a
trial against Appelbaum, but NO EVEN ONE OFFICIAL ACCUSATION from those
"victims" (which is no problem to do, you know, but those fuckers don't
want to do *the bare minimum*, because they are afraid that the lie will
blow up in the police station sooner or later). *So for me, they are
SLANDERS. It's a SMEAR CAMPAIGN. Jake IS innocent. That's it.*
I am saying a fair trial. And not some fucken rumors.
And you are saying "rumors" -> thus Appelbaum/me/you are fucked up.
As i said, it's a way to inquisition trials. Which are based on no true
evidences, but rumors/feelings and in which you are guilty until proven

@_subject: A Russian Warning 
*A Russian Warning
We, the undersigned, are Russians living and working in the USA. We have
been watching with increasing anxiety as the current US and NATO policies
have set us on an extremely dangerous collision course with the Russian
Federation, as well as with China. Many respected, patriotic Americans,
such as Paul Craig Roberts, Stephen Cohen, Philip Giraldi, Ray McGovern and
many others have been issuing warnings of a looming a Third World War. But
their voices have been all but lost among the din of a mass media that is
full of deceptive and inaccurate stories that characterize the Russian
economy as being in shambles and the Russian military as weak—all based on
no evidence. But we—knowing both Russian history and the current state of
Russian society and the Russian military, cannot swallow these lies. We now
feel that it is our duty, as Russians living in the US, to warn the
American people that they are being lied to, and to tell them the truth.
And the truth is simply this:
*If there is going to be a war with Russia, then the United Stateswill most
certainly be destroyed, and most of us will end up dead.*
Let us take a step back and put what is happening in a historical context.
Russia has suffered a great deal at the hands of foreign invaders, losing
22 million people in World War II. Most of the dead were civilians, because
the country was invaded, and the Russians have vowed to never let such a
disaster happen again. Each time Russia had been invaded, she emerged
victorious. In 1812 Nepoleon invaded Russia; in 1814 Russian cavalry rode
into Paris. On June 22, 1941, Hitler’s Luftwaffe bombed Kiev; On May 8,
1945, Soviet troops rolled into Berlin.
But times have changed since then. If Hitler were to attack Russia today,
he would be dead 20 to 30 minutes later, his bunker reduced to glowing
rubble by a strike from a Kalibr supersonic cruise missile launched from a
small Russian navy ship somewhere in the Baltic Sea. The operational
abilities of the new Russian military have been most persuasively
demonstrated during the recent action against ISIS, Al Nusra and other
foreign-funded terrorist groups operating in Syria. A long time ago Russia
had to respond to provocations by fighting land battles on her own
territory, then launching a counter-invasion; but this is no longer
necessary. Russia’s new weapons make retaliation instant, undetectable,
unstoppable and perfectly lethal.
Thus, if tomorrow a war were to break out between the US and Russia, it is
guaranteed that the US would be obliterated. At a minimum, there would no
longer be an electric grid, no internet, no oil and gas pipelines, no
interstate highway system, no air transportation or GPS-based navigation.
Financial centers would lie in ruins. Government at every level would cease
to function. US armed forces, stationed all around the globe, would no
longer be resupplied. At a maximum, the entire landmass of the US would be
covered by a layer of radioactive ash. We tell you this not to be alarmist,
but because, based on everything we know, we are ourselves alarmed. If
attacked, Russia will not back down; she will retaliate, and she will
utterly annihilate the United States.
The US leadership has done everything it could to push the situation to the
brink of disaster. First, its anti-Russian policies have convinced the
Russian leadership that making concessions or negotiating with the West is
futile. It has become apparent that the West will always support any
individual, movement or government that is anti-Russian, be it tax-cheating
Russian oligarchs, convicted Ukrainian war criminals, Saudi-supported
Wahhabi terrorists in Chechnya or cathedral-desecrating punks in Moscow.
Now that NATO, in violation of its previous promises, has expanded right up
to the Russian border, with US forces deployed in the Baltic states, within
artillery range of St. Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city, the
Russians have nowhere left to retreat. They will not attack; nor will they
back down or surrender. The Russian leadership enjoys over 80% of popular
support; the remaining 20% seems to feel that it is being too soft in
opposing Western encroachment. But Russia will retaliate, and a provocation
or a simple mistake could trigger a sequence of events that will end with
millions of Americans dead and the US in ruins.
Unlike many Americans, who see war as an exciting, victorious foreign
adventure, the Russians hate and fear war. But they are also ready for it,
and they have been preparing for war for several years now. Their
preparations have been most effective. Unlike the US, which squanders
untold billions on dubious overpriced arms programs such as the F-35 joint
task fighter, the Russians are extremely stingy with their defense rubles,
getting as much as 10 times the bang for the buck compared to the bloated
US defense industry. While it is true that the Russian economy has suffered
from low energy prices, it is far from being in shambles, and a return to
growth is expected as early as next year. Senator John McCain once called
Russia “A gas station masquerading as a country.” Well, he lied. Yes,
Russia is the world’s largest oil producer and second-largest oil exporter,
but it is also world’s largest exporter of grain and nuclear power
technology. It is as advanced and sophisticated a society as the United
States. Russia’s armed forces, both conventional and nuclear, are now ready
to fight, and they are more than a match for the US and NATO, especially if
a war erupts anywhere near the Russian border.
But such a fight would be suicidal for all sides. We strongly believe that
a conventional war in Europe runs a strong chance of turning nuclear very
rapidly, and that any US/NATO nuclear strike on Russian forces or territory
will automatically trigger a retaliatory Russian nuclear strike on the
continental US. Contrary to irresponsible statements made by some American
propagandists, American antiballistic missile systems are incapable of
shielding the American people from a Russian nuclear strike. Russia has the
means to strike at targets in the USA with long-range nuclear as well as
conventional weapons.
The sole reason why the USA and Russia have found themselves on a collision
course, instead of defusing tensions and cooperating on a wide range of
international problems, is the stubborn refusal by the US leadership to
accept Russia as an equal partner: Washington is dead set on being the
“world leader” and the “indispensable nation,” even as its influence
steadily dwindles in the wake of a string of foreign policy and military
disasters such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Yemen and the Ukraine.
Continued American global leadership is something that neither Russia, nor
China, nor most of the other countries are willing to accept. This gradual
but apparent loss of power and influence has caused the US leadership to
become hysterical; and it is but a small step from hysterical to suicidal.
America’s political leaders need to be placed under suicide watch.
First and foremost, we are appealing to the commanders of the US Armed
Forces to follow the example of Admiral William Fallon, who, when asked
about a war with Iran, reportedly replied “not on my watch.” We know that
you are not suicidal, and that you do not wish to die for the sake of
out-of-touch imperial hubris. If possible, please tell your staff,
colleagues and, especially, your civilian superiors that a war with Russia
will not happen on your watch. At the very least, take that pledge
yourselves, and, should the day ever come when the suicidal order is
issued, refuse to execute it on the grounds that it is criminal. Remember
that according to the Nuremberg Tribunal “To initiate a war of aggression…
is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime
differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the
accumulated evil of the whole.” Since Nuremberg, “I was just following
orders” is no longer a valid defense; please don’t be war criminals.
We also appeal to the American people to take peaceful but forceful action
to oppose any politician or party that engages in irresponsible,
provocative Russia-baiting, and that condones and supports a policy of
needless confrontation with a nuclear superpower that is capable of
destroying America in about an hour. Speak up, break through the barrier of
mass media propaganda, and make your fellow Americans aware of the immense
danger of a confrontation between Russia and the US.
There is no objective reason why US and Russia should consider each other
adversaries. The current confrontation is entirely the result of the
extremist views of the neoconservative cult, whose members were allowed to
infiltrate the US Federal government under President Bill Clinton, and who
consider any country that refuses to obey their dictates as an enemy to be
crushed. Thanks to their tireless efforts, over a million innocent people
have already died in the former Yugoslavia, in Afghanistan, in Iraq, Libya,
Syria, Pakistan, the Ukraine, Yemen, Somalia and in many other
countries—all because of their maniacal insistence that the USA must be a
world empire, not a just a regular, normal country, and that every national
leader must either bow down before them, or be overthrown. In Russia, this
irresistible force has finally encountered an immovable object. They must
be forced to back down before they destroy us all.
We are absolutely and categorically certain that Russia will never attack
the US, nor any EU member state, that Russia is not at all interested in
recreating the USSR, and that there is no “Russian threat” or “Russian
aggression.” Much of Russia’s recent economic success has a lot to do with
the shedding of former Soviet dependencies, allowing her to pursue a
“Russia first” policy. But we are just as certain that if Russia is
attacked, or even threatened with attack, she will not back down, and that
the Russian leadership will not “blink.” With great sadness and a heavy
heart they will do their sworn duty and unleash a nuclear barrage from
which the United States will never recover. Even if the entire Russian
leadership is killed in a first strike, the so-called “Dead Hand” (the
“Perimetr” system) will automatically launch enough nukes to wipe the USA
off the political map. *We feel that it is our duty to do all we can to
prevent such a catastrophe.*

In the past few days, a calculated and targeted attack has been launched to
spread vicious and spurious allegations against me. Given the way these
accusations have been handled, I had little choice but to resign from my
position as an advocate at the Tor Project and devote my full attention to
completing my doctoral work on cryptography at the Technical University of
Vague rumors and smear campaigns against me are nothing new. As a longtime
public advocate for free speech and a secure internet, there have been
plenty of attempts to undermine my work over the years.
Now, however, these unsubstantiated and unfounded attacks have become so
aggressive that I feel it’s necessary to set the record straight. Not only
have I been the target of a fake website in my name that has falsely
accused me of serious crimes, but I have also received death threats
(including a Twitter handle entitled ‘TimeToDieJake’).
I think it’s extremely damaging to the community that these
character-assassination tactics are being deployed, especially given their
ugly history of being used against fellow members of the LGBT community. It
pains me to watch the community to which I’ve dedicated so much of my life
engage in such self-destructive behavior. Nonetheless, I am prepared to use
legal channels, if necessary, to defend my reputation from these libelous
I want to be clear: the accusations of criminal sexual misconduct against
me are entirely false.
Inevitably, there may have been moments in my professional or private life
when I may have inadvertently hurt or offended others’ feelings. Whenever I
was aware of these instances, I have, and will continue to, apologize to
the friends and colleagues in question and to continually learn how to be a
better person. Though the damage to my reputation caused by these
allegations alone is impossible to undo, I nonetheless take the concerns of
the Tor community seriously. To dispel any further rumors, to the best of
my knowledge, the Tor network is not ‘compromised.’
I’ve dedicated my life as a journalist, activist, and longtime member of
the Tor Project to advocating for the transparency of public processes and
to speaking out about the necessity of privacy, security, and anonymity.
These are ideals that I will continue to uphold, despite the vicious
campaign that is currently being waged against me.

Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution is a book by Peter Kropotkin
Written partly in response to social Darwinism and in particular to Thomas
H. Huxley's Nineteenth Century essay, "The Struggle for Existence",
Kropotkin's book drew on his experiences in scientific expeditions in
Siberia to illustrate the phenomenon of cooperation. After examining the
evidence of cooperation in nonhuman animals, in pre-feudal societies and
medieval cities, and in modern times, he concluded that *cooperation and
mutual aid, and not Darwin's pitiless struggle, are the most important
factors in the evolution of species and the ability to survive.*

*This article is not some amateur propaganda. This is truth, people. I
speak in the name of the vast majority of hundreds of Russian people i
know/knew very well.*
It would never occur to any hero from a Russian epic to sacrifice his life
in exchange for riches.
He did not hesitate to reject the path by which he would “be rich,” instead
voluntarily taking the road on which he would “be killed.”
The Russian champion has always gone to war as a liberator, not a
conqueror! And in this we can see the difference between Russians and
Western Europeans.
Humanity in Western Europe is motivated by will and intellect. The Russian
people are above all guided by their hearts and imaginations, relegating
the mind and will to a supporting role.
The Russian people never committed the same atrocities for which the
enlightened Europeans were responsible in their own conquered lands.
Spiritual strength is the basis for Russians’ renowned forbearance and
tolerance toward others.
Continually invaded from all sides and forced to live in an incredibly
harsh climate, the Russian people managed to colonize vast swathes of land,
but without slaughtering, enslaving, robbing, or forcibly baptizing any
Western Europeans’ policies of colonialism annihilated the aboriginal
populations on three continents and forced natives from across Africa into
slavery, while its cities grew rich on the backs of those colonies.
The Russian nation never treated their conquered subjects as the Europeans
Russia has never been a nationalist state – it has belonged to all who
inhabit her.
Precisely because they have borne so much suffering and heavy sacrifice, my
people deeply empathized with the pain and suffering of other people.
The patriotism displayed by Russian soldiers in the fields of the Great
Patriotic War met the highest ideal of patriotism – something unprecedented
in the history of any nation anywhere in the world. And I will never agree
with the media’s pronouncements about Russian “barbarianism” vs. European
I stand proud that our ancestors – our heroic ancestors – were so lovely,
steadfast, courageous, and resilient, and that we are their descendants!

lie AND truth //
black AND white //
destroyer AND savior
a few words about the smear campaign against Stalin for the last 70 years.
(information not from your TV/papers/great propaganda bibliographic book):
*Let's Be Honest - Stalin Was Less of a Criminal Than Churchill, Truman,
and LBJ*
"It's time to recover the truth about Stalin and the USSR from a cesspool
of hostile propaganda"
We have long maintained that the truth about the USSR, in general, and
particularly the Stalin period, has long been the object of the most
cynical, mean-spirited, and comprehensive propaganda effort ever seen in
the annals of history.
For reasons of sheer class interest among the plutocrats of the West, the
business elites that still rule most of the so-called “capitalist
democracies,” the demonization of Stalin was a necessity, a campaign only
briefly interrupted by World War Two and quickly resumed literally a few
hours after its ending.
The Western elites —with the American ruling circles in the lead—correctly
saw an enemy in Stalin. They could not bribe him and they could not
intimidate him. Nor could they easily topple him, as they had done (and
still do) countless times with weaker, “inconvenient leaders.” What’s more,
Stalin was at the helm of a powerful nation and titular leader of an
ideology directly opposed to their indispensable economic system.
Occasional diplomacy aside, they hated him. He and his nation stood in the
way of their plans for global hegemony. So the the venom had to flow and
did—abundantly. And in that sordid enterprise the capitalist elites found
countless allies, not to mention the usual battalions of ignorant, useful
As any propaganda student will attest, when vilifying a nation’s policies
and social values, it’s far easier (and effective) if the propagandist aims
the Big Lie machine at its leader. As we have seen in recent times with
Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein, Bashar al-Assad, Fidel Castro, Iran and North
Korea’s leaders, Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez, and finally Putin—among many
others (the empire is never lacking in “dangerous enemies”)—the character
assassination of a leader is an old tactic to prepare the perennially
benighted home population for an attack on the targeted nation.
Truth could swiftly complete the total demonization of Vladimir Putin—a
figure in good standing merely 3 years ago—and not even an avowed
socialist, one can only imagine what outrageous fabrications they could
have concocted (and did) to cordon off the image of Stalin, an outspoken
communist, over several decades. This made eminent sense to the West’s
doctrinal gatekeepers. Given the identification of Stalin’s long rule with
the Soviet Union at its most embattled, the blackening of Stalin’s name
served an important purpose: it provided the Western propagandists an
invaluable shorthand—an “irrefutable symbol” of communism’s putative
evil—to block the very idea of genuine socialism as an option for humanity.
The preceding is obviously not to argue that Stalin was a flawless leader,
or a saint who just happened to have a powerful army, or that he didn’t
make some serious mistakes. He did. However, the most elementary fairness
demands that we ask, which world historical figure confronted with
enormously difficult choices emerges today (barring self-serving
ideological propaganda) unscathed from close and impartial examination?
Judging Stalin by the context in which he had to act, and even more
important, the purposes he served, he was arguably no worse, morally, than
most Western leaders, and by any rational measure, probably a damn sight
better.  For who are these distinguished gentlemen who have led the West
for over a century now?
Churchill, the most revered member in the club, was an unapologetic racist
and imperialist who in the 1920s endorsed the policy of RAF bombing and
gassing Iraqi villages (Mesopotamia) into submission, for for failure to
pay their assigned tribute. JFK, Lyndon Johnson, and Nixon pursued an
illegitimate, barbaric, genocidal war in Vietnam that remains one of the
horrors of modern imperialism. Truman dropped the bomb on the Japanese as a
way to keep the Soviets “in line,” making America so far the only nation to
have used nuclear weapons on a civilian population. And during the postwar,
the US tentacles, chiefly acting through the CIA and its clients, have
managed to murder and repress tens of millions of people around the
globe—in all latitudes and scores of nations, from the Philippines, to
Indonesia to Chile, to Nicaragua, to Iran, the Congo, Korea, the entire
Middle East, literally bathed in blood—always in pursuit of geostrategic
advantage, and the suppression of popular democracy in order to better
permit the continuation and maximization of corporate profit. So much for
the inherent perfidy of communism and angelic innocence of capitalism.
The record is by now so huge and consistent, the hypocrisy so staggering,
that we can state categorically there is not a single case in which America
has used its immense diplomatic and military power to back a genuine
democratic leader (such people are immediately branded “communists” and
dealt accordingly) or assisted people struggling for freedom from class
oppression. It’s a vile and hypocritical record that continues to this day,
thanks to the complete brainwash to which the American population has been
subjected as a measure of pre-emptive pacification. The whole thing is
amply documented so there’s no point in even trying to refute it.
In any case, recovering the truth about Stalin and the USSR from the
cesspool of hostile propaganda in which the enemies of socialism situated
it, assisted by the perennially misguided and often fanatical
anti-communist and especially anti-Stalinist leftists, is no task for the
That’s why we salute our colleagues at Russia Insider, and its editor,
Charlie Bausman, in particular, for their decision to publish Grover Furr.
Letting this scholar speak to a larger audience is a badly needed blow for
truth —especially in the current context of reckless warmongering on
Russia’s and China’s doorstep. The Big Lie must be defeated if a lasting
peace is ever to be attained by humanity.

@_subject: A Russian Warning 
*A Russian Warning
We, the undersigned, are Russians living and working in the USA. We have
been watching with increasing anxiety as the current US and NATO policies
have set us on an extremely dangerous collision course with the Russian
Federation, as well as with China. Many respected, patriotic Americans,
such as Paul Craig Roberts, Stephen Cohen, Philip Giraldi, Ray McGovern and
many others have been issuing warnings of a looming a Third World War. But
their voices have been all but lost among the din of a mass media that is
full of deceptive and inaccurate stories that characterize the Russian
economy as being in shambles and the Russian military as weak—all based on
no evidence. But we—knowing both Russian history and the current state of
Russian society and the Russian military, cannot swallow these lies. We now
feel that it is our duty, as Russians living in the US, to warn the
American people that they are being lied to, and to tell them the truth.
And the truth is simply this:
*If there is going to be a war with Russia, then the United Stateswill most
certainly be destroyed, and most of us will end up dead.*
Let us take a step back and put what is happening in a historical context.
Russia has suffered a great deal at the hands of foreign invaders, losing
22 million people in World War II. Most of the dead were civilians, because
the country was invaded, and the Russians have vowed to never let such a
disaster happen again. Each time Russia had been invaded, she emerged
victorious. In 1812 Nepoleon invaded Russia; in 1814 Russian cavalry rode
into Paris. On June 22, 1941, Hitler’s Luftwaffe bombed Kiev; On May 8,
1945, Soviet troops rolled into Berlin.
But times have changed since then. If Hitler were to attack Russia today,
he would be dead 20 to 30 minutes later, his bunker reduced to glowing
rubble by a strike from a Kalibr supersonic cruise missile launched from a
small Russian navy ship somewhere in the Baltic Sea. The operational
abilities of the new Russian military have been most persuasively
demonstrated during the recent action against ISIS, Al Nusra and other
foreign-funded terrorist groups operating in Syria. A long time ago Russia
had to respond to provocations by fighting land battles on her own
territory, then launching a counter-invasion; but this is no longer
necessary. Russia’s new weapons make retaliation instant, undetectable,
unstoppable and perfectly lethal.
Thus, if tomorrow a war were to break out between the US and Russia, it is
guaranteed that the US would be obliterated. At a minimum, there would no
longer be an electric grid, no internet, no oil and gas pipelines, no
interstate highway system, no air transportation or GPS-based navigation.
Financial centers would lie in ruins. Government at every level would cease
to function. US armed forces, stationed all around the globe, would no
longer be resupplied. At a maximum, the entire landmass of the US would be
covered by a layer of radioactive ash. We tell you this not to be alarmist,
but because, based on everything we know, we are ourselves alarmed. If
attacked, Russia will not back down; she will retaliate, and she will
utterly annihilate the United States.
The US leadership has done everything it could to push the situation to the
brink of disaster. First, its anti-Russian policies have convinced the
Russian leadership that making concessions or negotiating with the West is
futile. It has become apparent that the West will always support any
individual, movement or government that is anti-Russian, be it tax-cheating
Russian oligarchs, convicted Ukrainian war criminals, Saudi-supported
Wahhabi terrorists in Chechnya or cathedral-desecrating punks in Moscow.
Now that NATO, in violation of its previous promises, has expanded right up
to the Russian border, with US forces deployed in the Baltic states, within
artillery range of St. Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city, the
Russians have nowhere left to retreat. They will not attack; nor will they
back down or surrender. The Russian leadership enjoys over 80% of popular
support; the remaining 20% seems to feel that it is being too soft in
opposing Western encroachment. But Russia will retaliate, and a provocation
or a simple mistake could trigger a sequence of events that will end with
millions of Americans dead and the US in ruins.
Unlike many Americans, who see war as an exciting, victorious foreign
adventure, the Russians hate and fear war. But they are also ready for it,
and they have been preparing for war for several years now. Their
preparations have been most effective. Unlike the US, which squanders
untold billions on dubious overpriced arms programs such as the F-35 joint
task fighter, the Russians are extremely stingy with their defense rubles,
getting as much as 10 times the bang for the buck compared to the bloated
US defense industry. While it is true that the Russian economy has suffered
from low energy prices, it is far from being in shambles, and a return to
growth is expected as early as next year. Senator John McCain once called
Russia “A gas station masquerading as a country.” Well, he lied. Yes,
Russia is the world’s largest oil producer and second-largest oil exporter,
but it is also world’s largest exporter of grain and nuclear power
technology. It is as advanced and sophisticated a society as the United
States. Russia’s armed forces, both conventional and nuclear, are now ready
to fight, and they are more than a match for the US and NATO, especially if
a war erupts anywhere near the Russian border.
But such a fight would be suicidal for all sides. We strongly believe that
a conventional war in Europe runs a strong chance of turning nuclear very
rapidly, and that any US/NATO nuclear strike on Russian forces or territory
will automatically trigger a retaliatory Russian nuclear strike on the
continental US. Contrary to irresponsible statements made by some American
propagandists, American antiballistic missile systems are incapable of
shielding the American people from a Russian nuclear strike. Russia has the
means to strike at targets in the USA with long-range nuclear as well as
conventional weapons.
The sole reason why the USA and Russia have found themselves on a collision
course, instead of defusing tensions and cooperating on a wide range of
international problems, is the stubborn refusal by the US leadership to
accept Russia as an equal partner: Washington is dead set on being the
“world leader” and the “indispensable nation,” even as its influence
steadily dwindles in the wake of a string of foreign policy and military
disasters such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Yemen and the Ukraine.
Continued American global leadership is something that neither Russia, nor
China, nor most of the other countries are willing to accept. This gradual
but apparent loss of power and influence has caused the US leadership to
become hysterical; and it is but a small step from hysterical to suicidal.
America’s political leaders need to be placed under suicide watch.
First and foremost, we are appealing to the commanders of the US Armed
Forces to follow the example of Admiral William Fallon, who, when asked
about a war with Iran, reportedly replied “not on my watch.” We know that
you are not suicidal, and that you do not wish to die for the sake of
out-of-touch imperial hubris. If possible, please tell your staff,
colleagues and, especially, your civilian superiors that a war with Russia
will not happen on your watch. At the very least, take that pledge
yourselves, and, should the day ever come when the suicidal order is
issued, refuse to execute it on the grounds that it is criminal. Remember
that according to the Nuremberg Tribunal “To initiate a war of aggression…
is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime
differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the
accumulated evil of the whole.” Since Nuremberg, “I was just following
orders” is no longer a valid defense; please don’t be war criminals.
We also appeal to the American people to take peaceful but forceful action
to oppose any politician or party that engages in irresponsible,
provocative Russia-baiting, and that condones and supports a policy of
needless confrontation with a nuclear superpower that is capable of
destroying America in about an hour. Speak up, break through the barrier of
mass media propaganda, and make your fellow Americans aware of the immense
danger of a confrontation between Russia and the US.
There is no objective reason why US and Russia should consider each other
adversaries. The current confrontation is entirely the result of the
extremist views of the neoconservative cult, whose members were allowed to
infiltrate the US Federal government under President Bill Clinton, and who
consider any country that refuses to obey their dictates as an enemy to be
crushed. Thanks to their tireless efforts, over a million innocent people
have already died in the former Yugoslavia, in Afghanistan, in Iraq, Libya,
Syria, Pakistan, the Ukraine, Yemen, Somalia and in many other
countries—all because of their maniacal insistence that the USA must be a
world empire, not a just a regular, normal country, and that every national
leader must either bow down before them, or be overthrown. In Russia, this
irresistible force has finally encountered an immovable object. They must
be forced to back down before they destroy us all.
We are absolutely and categorically certain that Russia will never attack
the US, nor any EU member state, that Russia is not at all interested in
recreating the USSR, and that there is no “Russian threat” or “Russian
aggression.” Much of Russia’s recent economic success has a lot to do with
the shedding of former Soviet dependencies, allowing her to pursue a
“Russia first” policy. But we are just as certain that if Russia is
attacked, or even threatened with attack, she will not back down, and that
the Russian leadership will not “blink.” With great sadness and a heavy
heart they will do their sworn duty and unleash a nuclear barrage from
which the United States will never recover. Even if the entire Russian
leadership is killed in a first strike, the so-called “Dead Hand” (the
“Perimetr” system) will automatically launch enough nukes to wipe the USA
off the political map. *We feel that it is our duty to do all we can to
prevent such a catastrophe.*

In the past few days, a calculated and targeted attack has been launched to
spread vicious and spurious allegations against me. Given the way these
accusations have been handled, I had little choice but to resign from my
position as an advocate at the Tor Project and devote my full attention to
completing my doctoral work on cryptography at the Technical University of
Vague rumors and smear campaigns against me are nothing new. As a longtime
public advocate for free speech and a secure internet, there have been
plenty of attempts to undermine my work over the years.
Now, however, these unsubstantiated and unfounded attacks have become so
aggressive that I feel it’s necessary to set the record straight. Not only
have I been the target of a fake website in my name that has falsely
accused me of serious crimes, but I have also received death threats
(including a Twitter handle entitled ‘TimeToDieJake’).
I think it’s extremely damaging to the community that these
character-assassination tactics are being deployed, especially given their
ugly history of being used against fellow members of the LGBT community. It
pains me to watch the community to which I’ve dedicated so much of my life
engage in such self-destructive behavior. Nonetheless, I am prepared to use
legal channels, if necessary, to defend my reputation from these libelous
I want to be clear: the accusations of criminal sexual misconduct against
me are entirely false.
Inevitably, there may have been moments in my professional or private life
when I may have inadvertently hurt or offended others’ feelings. Whenever I
was aware of these instances, I have, and will continue to, apologize to
the friends and colleagues in question and to continually learn how to be a
better person. Though the damage to my reputation caused by these
allegations alone is impossible to undo, I nonetheless take the concerns of
the Tor community seriously. To dispel any further rumors, to the best of
my knowledge, the Tor network is not ‘compromised.’
I’ve dedicated my life as a journalist, activist, and longtime member of
the Tor Project to advocating for the transparency of public processes and
to speaking out about the necessity of privacy, security, and anonymity.
These are ideals that I will continue to uphold, despite the vicious
campaign that is currently being waged against me.

Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution is a book by Peter Kropotkin
Written partly in response to social Darwinism and in particular to Thomas
H. Huxley's Nineteenth Century essay, "The Struggle for Existence",
Kropotkin's book drew on his experiences in scientific expeditions in
Siberia to illustrate the phenomenon of cooperation. After examining the
evidence of cooperation in nonhuman animals, in pre-feudal societies and
medieval cities, and in modern times, he concluded that *cooperation and
mutual aid, and not Darwin's pitiless struggle, are the most important
factors in the evolution of species and the ability to survive.*

*This article is not some amateur propaganda. This is truth, people. I
speak in the name of the vast majority of hundreds of Russian people i
know/knew very well.*
It would never occur to any hero from a Russian epic to sacrifice his life
in exchange for riches.
He did not hesitate to reject the path by which he would “be rich,” instead
voluntarily taking the road on which he would “be killed.”
The Russian champion has always gone to war as a liberator, not a
conqueror! And in this we can see the difference between Russians and
Western Europeans.
Humanity in Western Europe is motivated by will and intellect. The Russian
people are above all guided by their hearts and imaginations, relegating
the mind and will to a supporting role.
The Russian people never committed the same atrocities for which the
enlightened Europeans were responsible in their own conquered lands.
Spiritual strength is the basis for Russians’ renowned forbearance and
tolerance toward others.
Continually invaded from all sides and forced to live in an incredibly
harsh climate, the Russian people managed to colonize vast swathes of land,
but without slaughtering, enslaving, robbing, or forcibly baptizing any
Western Europeans’ policies of colonialism annihilated the aboriginal
populations on three continents and forced natives from across Africa into
slavery, while its cities grew rich on the backs of those colonies.
The Russian nation never treated their conquered subjects as the Europeans
Russia has never been a nationalist state – it has belonged to all who
inhabit her.
Precisely because they have borne so much suffering and heavy sacrifice, my
people deeply empathized with the pain and suffering of other people.
The patriotism displayed by Russian soldiers in the fields of the Great
Patriotic War met the highest ideal of patriotism – something unprecedented
in the history of any nation anywhere in the world. And I will never agree
with the media’s pronouncements about Russian “barbarianism” vs. European
I stand proud that our ancestors – our heroic ancestors – were so lovely,
steadfast, courageous, and resilient, and that we are their descendants!

lie AND truth //
black AND white //
destroyer AND savior
a few words about the smear campaign against Stalin for the last 70 years.
(information not from your TV/papers/great propaganda bibliographic book):
*Let's Be Honest - Stalin Was Less of a Criminal Than Churchill, Truman,
and LBJ*
"It's time to recover the truth about Stalin and the USSR from a cesspool
of hostile propaganda"
We have long maintained that the truth about the USSR, in general, and
particularly the Stalin period, has long been the object of the most
cynical, mean-spirited, and comprehensive propaganda effort ever seen in
the annals of history.
For reasons of sheer class interest among the plutocrats of the West, the
business elites that still rule most of the so-called “capitalist
democracies,” the demonization of Stalin was a necessity, a campaign only
briefly interrupted by World War Two and quickly resumed literally a few
hours after its ending.
The Western elites —with the American ruling circles in the lead—correctly
saw an enemy in Stalin. They could not bribe him and they could not
intimidate him. Nor could they easily topple him, as they had done (and
still do) countless times with weaker, “inconvenient leaders.” What’s more,
Stalin was at the helm of a powerful nation and titular leader of an
ideology directly opposed to their indispensable economic system.
Occasional diplomacy aside, they hated him. He and his nation stood in the
way of their plans for global hegemony. So the the venom had to flow and
did—abundantly. And in that sordid enterprise the capitalist elites found
countless allies, not to mention the usual battalions of ignorant, useful
As any propaganda student will attest, when vilifying a nation’s policies
and social values, it’s far easier (and effective) if the propagandist aims
the Big Lie machine at its leader. As we have seen in recent times with
Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein, Bashar al-Assad, Fidel Castro, Iran and North
Korea’s leaders, Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez, and finally Putin—among many
others (the empire is never lacking in “dangerous enemies”)—the character
assassination of a leader is an old tactic to prepare the perennially
benighted home population for an attack on the targeted nation.
Truth could swiftly complete the total demonization of Vladimir Putin—a
figure in good standing merely 3 years ago—and not even an avowed
socialist, one can only imagine what outrageous fabrications they could
have concocted (and did) to cordon off the image of Stalin, an outspoken
communist, over several decades. This made eminent sense to the West’s
doctrinal gatekeepers. Given the identification of Stalin’s long rule with
the Soviet Union at its most embattled, the blackening of Stalin’s name
served an important purpose: it provided the Western propagandists an
invaluable shorthand—an “irrefutable symbol” of communism’s putative
evil—to block the very idea of genuine socialism as an option for humanity.
The preceding is obviously not to argue that Stalin was a flawless leader,
or a saint who just happened to have a powerful army, or that he didn’t
make some serious mistakes. He did. However, the most elementary fairness
demands that we ask, which world historical figure confronted with
enormously difficult choices emerges today (barring self-serving
ideological propaganda) unscathed from close and impartial examination?
Judging Stalin by the context in which he had to act, and even more
important, the purposes he served, he was arguably no worse, morally, than
most Western leaders, and by any rational measure, probably a damn sight
better.  For who are these distinguished gentlemen who have led the West
for over a century now?
Churchill, the most revered member in the club, was an unapologetic racist
and imperialist who in the 1920s endorsed the policy of RAF bombing and
gassing Iraqi villages (Mesopotamia) into submission, for for failure to
pay their assigned tribute. JFK, Lyndon Johnson, and Nixon pursued an
illegitimate, barbaric, genocidal war in Vietnam that remains one of the
horrors of modern imperialism. Truman dropped the bomb on the Japanese as a
way to keep the Soviets “in line,” making America so far the only nation to
have used nuclear weapons on a civilian population. And during the postwar,
the US tentacles, chiefly acting through the CIA and its clients, have
managed to murder and repress tens of millions of people around the
globe—in all latitudes and scores of nations, from the Philippines, to
Indonesia to Chile, to Nicaragua, to Iran, the Congo, Korea, the entire
Middle East, literally bathed in blood—always in pursuit of geostrategic
advantage, and the suppression of popular democracy in order to better
permit the continuation and maximization of corporate profit. So much for
the inherent perfidy of communism and angelic innocence of capitalism.
The record is by now so huge and consistent, the hypocrisy so staggering,
that we can state categorically there is not a single case in which America
has used its immense diplomatic and military power to back a genuine
democratic leader (such people are immediately branded “communists” and
dealt accordingly) or assisted people struggling for freedom from class
oppression. It’s a vile and hypocritical record that continues to this day,
thanks to the complete brainwash to which the American population has been
subjected as a measure of pre-emptive pacification. The whole thing is
amply documented so there’s no point in even trying to refute it.
In any case, recovering the truth about Stalin and the USSR from the
cesspool of hostile propaganda in which the enemies of socialism situated
it, assisted by the perennially misguided and often fanatical
anti-communist and especially anti-Stalinist leftists, is no task for the
That’s why we salute our colleagues at Russia Insider, and its editor,
Charlie Bausman, in particular, for their decision to publish Grover Furr.
Letting this scholar speak to a larger audience is a badly needed blow for
truth —especially in the current context of reckless warmongering on
Russia’s and China’s doorstep. The Big Lie must be defeated if a lasting
peace is ever to be attained by humanity.

@_subject: A Russian Warning 
*A Russian Warning
We, the undersigned, are Russians living and working in the USA. We have
been watching with increasing anxiety as the current US and NATO policies
have set us on an extremely dangerous collision course with the Russian
Federation, as well as with China. Many respected, patriotic Americans,
such as Paul Craig Roberts, Stephen Cohen, Philip Giraldi, Ray McGovern and
many others have been issuing warnings of a looming a Third World War. But
their voices have been all but lost among the din of a mass media that is
full of deceptive and inaccurate stories that characterize the Russian
economy as being in shambles and the Russian military as weak—all based on
no evidence. But we—knowing both Russian history and the current state of
Russian society and the Russian military, cannot swallow these lies. We now
feel that it is our duty, as Russians living in the US, to warn the
American people that they are being lied to, and to tell them the truth.
And the truth is simply this:
*If there is going to be a war with Russia, then the United Stateswill most
certainly be destroyed, and most of us will end up dead.*
Let us take a step back and put what is happening in a historical context.
Russia has suffered a great deal at the hands of foreign invaders, losing
22 million people in World War II. Most of the dead were civilians, because
the country was invaded, and the Russians have vowed to never let such a
disaster happen again. Each time Russia had been invaded, she emerged
victorious. In 1812 Nepoleon invaded Russia; in 1814 Russian cavalry rode
into Paris. On June 22, 1941, Hitler’s Luftwaffe bombed Kiev; On May 8,
1945, Soviet troops rolled into Berlin.
But times have changed since then. If Hitler were to attack Russia today,
he would be dead 20 to 30 minutes later, his bunker reduced to glowing
rubble by a strike from a Kalibr supersonic cruise missile launched from a
small Russian navy ship somewhere in the Baltic Sea. The operational
abilities of the new Russian military have been most persuasively
demonstrated during the recent action against ISIS, Al Nusra and other
foreign-funded terrorist groups operating in Syria. A long time ago Russia
had to respond to provocations by fighting land battles on her own
territory, then launching a counter-invasion; but this is no longer
necessary. Russia’s new weapons make retaliation instant, undetectable,
unstoppable and perfectly lethal.
Thus, if tomorrow a war were to break out between the US and Russia, it is
guaranteed that the US would be obliterated. At a minimum, there would no
longer be an electric grid, no internet, no oil and gas pipelines, no
interstate highway system, no air transportation or GPS-based navigation.
Financial centers would lie in ruins. Government at every level would cease
to function. US armed forces, stationed all around the globe, would no
longer be resupplied. At a maximum, the entire landmass of the US would be
covered by a layer of radioactive ash. We tell you this not to be alarmist,
but because, based on everything we know, we are ourselves alarmed. If
attacked, Russia will not back down; she will retaliate, and she will
utterly annihilate the United States.
The US leadership has done everything it could to push the situation to the
brink of disaster. First, its anti-Russian policies have convinced the
Russian leadership that making concessions or negotiating with the West is
futile. It has become apparent that the West will always support any
individual, movement or government that is anti-Russian, be it tax-cheating
Russian oligarchs, convicted Ukrainian war criminals, Saudi-supported
Wahhabi terrorists in Chechnya or cathedral-desecrating punks in Moscow.
Now that NATO, in violation of its previous promises, has expanded right up
to the Russian border, with US forces deployed in the Baltic states, within
artillery range of St. Petersburg, Russia’s second-largest city, the
Russians have nowhere left to retreat. They will not attack; nor will they
back down or surrender. The Russian leadership enjoys over 80% of popular
support; the remaining 20% seems to feel that it is being too soft in
opposing Western encroachment. But Russia will retaliate, and a provocation
or a simple mistake could trigger a sequence of events that will end with
millions of Americans dead and the US in ruins.
Unlike many Americans, who see war as an exciting, victorious foreign
adventure, the Russians hate and fear war. But they are also ready for it,
and they have been preparing for war for several years now. Their
preparations have been most effective. Unlike the US, which squanders
untold billions on dubious overpriced arms programs such as the F-35 joint
task fighter, the Russians are extremely stingy with their defense rubles,
getting as much as 10 times the bang for the buck compared to the bloated
US defense industry. While it is true that the Russian economy has suffered
from low energy prices, it is far from being in shambles, and a return to
growth is expected as early as next year. Senator John McCain once called
Russia “A gas station masquerading as a country.” Well, he lied. Yes,
Russia is the world’s largest oil producer and second-largest oil exporter,
but it is also world’s largest exporter of grain and nuclear power
technology. It is as advanced and sophisticated a society as the United
States. Russia’s armed forces, both conventional and nuclear, are now ready
to fight, and they are more than a match for the US and NATO, especially if
a war erupts anywhere near the Russian border.
But such a fight would be suicidal for all sides. We strongly believe that
a conventional war in Europe runs a strong chance of turning nuclear very
rapidly, and that any US/NATO nuclear strike on Russian forces or territory
will automatically trigger a retaliatory Russian nuclear strike on the
continental US. Contrary to irresponsible statements made by some American
propagandists, American antiballistic missile systems are incapable of
shielding the American people from a Russian nuclear strike. Russia has the
means to strike at targets in the USA with long-range nuclear as well as
conventional weapons.
The sole reason why the USA and Russia have found themselves on a collision
course, instead of defusing tensions and cooperating on a wide range of
international problems, is the stubborn refusal by the US leadership to
accept Russia as an equal partner: Washington is dead set on being the
“world leader” and the “indispensable nation,” even as its influence
steadily dwindles in the wake of a string of foreign policy and military
disasters such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Syria, Yemen and the Ukraine.
Continued American global leadership is something that neither Russia, nor
China, nor most of the other countries are willing to accept. This gradual
but apparent loss of power and influence has caused the US leadership to
become hysterical; and it is but a small step from hysterical to suicidal.
America’s political leaders need to be placed under suicide watch.
First and foremost, we are appealing to the commanders of the US Armed
Forces to follow the example of Admiral William Fallon, who, when asked
about a war with Iran, reportedly replied “not on my watch.” We know that
you are not suicidal, and that you do not wish to die for the sake of
out-of-touch imperial hubris. If possible, please tell your staff,
colleagues and, especially, your civilian superiors that a war with Russia
will not happen on your watch. At the very least, take that pledge
yourselves, and, should the day ever come when the suicidal order is
issued, refuse to execute it on the grounds that it is criminal. Remember
that according to the Nuremberg Tribunal “To initiate a war of aggression…
is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime
differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the
accumulated evil of the whole.” Since Nuremberg, “I was just following
orders” is no longer a valid defense; please don’t be war criminals.
We also appeal to the American people to take peaceful but forceful action
to oppose any politician or party that engages in irresponsible,
provocative Russia-baiting, and that condones and supports a policy of
needless confrontation with a nuclear superpower that is capable of
destroying America in about an hour. Speak up, break through the barrier of
mass media propaganda, and make your fellow Americans aware of the immense
danger of a confrontation between Russia and the US.
There is no objective reason why US and Russia should consider each other
adversaries. The current confrontation is entirely the result of the
extremist views of the neoconservative cult, whose members were allowed to
infiltrate the US Federal government under President Bill Clinton, and who
consider any country that refuses to obey their dictates as an enemy to be
crushed. Thanks to their tireless efforts, over a million innocent people
have already died in the former Yugoslavia, in Afghanistan, in Iraq, Libya,
Syria, Pakistan, the Ukraine, Yemen, Somalia and in many other
countries—all because of their maniacal insistence that the USA must be a
world empire, not a just a regular, normal country, and that every national
leader must either bow down before them, or be overthrown. In Russia, this
irresistible force has finally encountered an immovable object. They must
be forced to back down before they destroy us all.
We are absolutely and categorically certain that Russia will never attack
the US, nor any EU member state, that Russia is not at all interested in
recreating the USSR, and that there is no “Russian threat” or “Russian
aggression.” Much of Russia’s recent economic success has a lot to do with
the shedding of former Soviet dependencies, allowing her to pursue a
“Russia first” policy. But we are just as certain that if Russia is
attacked, or even threatened with attack, she will not back down, and that
the Russian leadership will not “blink.” With great sadness and a heavy
heart they will do their sworn duty and unleash a nuclear barrage from
which the United States will never recover. Even if the entire Russian
leadership is killed in a first strike, the so-called “Dead Hand” (the
“Perimetr” system) will automatically launch enough nukes to wipe the USA
off the political map. *We feel that it is our duty to do all we can to
prevent such a catastrophe.*

Capitalism/Darwinism. (Russia -vs- West)
Mutual Aid: A Factor of Evolution is a book by Peter Kropotkin
Written partly in response to social Darwinism and in particular to Thomas
H. Huxley's Nineteenth Century essay, "The Struggle for Existence",
Kropotkin's book drew on his experiences in scientific expeditions in
Siberia to illustrate the phenomenon of cooperation. After examining the
evidence of cooperation in nonhuman animals, in pre-feudal societies and
medieval cities, and in modern times, he concluded that *cooperation and
mutual aid, and not Darwin's pitiless struggle, are the most important
factors in the evolution of species and the ability to survive.*

*This article is not some amateur propaganda. This is truth, people. I
speak in the name of the vast majority of hundreds of Russian people i
know/knew very well.*
It would never occur to any hero from a Russian epic to sacrifice his life
in exchange for riches.
He did not hesitate to reject the path by which he would “be rich,” instead
voluntarily taking the road on which he would “be killed.”
The Russian champion has always gone to war as a liberator, not a
conqueror! And in this we can see the difference between Russians and
Western Europeans.
Humanity in Western Europe is motivated by will and intellect. The Russian
people are above all guided by their hearts and imaginations, relegating
the mind and will to a supporting role.
The Russian people never committed the same atrocities for which the
enlightened Europeans were responsible in their own conquered lands.
Spiritual strength is the basis for Russians’ renowned forbearance and
tolerance toward others.
Continually invaded from all sides and forced to live in an incredibly
harsh climate, the Russian people managed to colonize vast swathes of land,
but without slaughtering, enslaving, robbing, or forcibly baptizing any
Western Europeans’ policies of colonialism annihilated the aboriginal
populations on three continents and forced natives from across Africa into
slavery, while its cities grew rich on the backs of those colonies.
The Russian nation never treated their conquered subjects as the Europeans
Russia has never been a nationalist state – it has belonged to all who
inhabit her.
Precisely because they have borne so much suffering and heavy sacrifice, my
people deeply empathized with the pain and suffering of other people.
The patriotism displayed by Russian soldiers in the fields of the Great
Patriotic War met the highest ideal of patriotism – something unprecedented
in the history of any nation anywhere in the world. And I will never agree
with the media’s pronouncements about Russian “barbarianism” vs. European
I stand proud that our ancestors – our heroic ancestors – were so lovely,
steadfast, courageous, and resilient, and that we are their descendants!

it's the Russian real-core DIFFERENCE from other nations, especially from

lie AND truth //
black AND white //
destroyer AND savior
a few words about the smear campaign against Stalin for the last 70 years.
(information not from your TV/papers/great propaganda bibliographic book):
*Let's Be Honest - Stalin Was Less of a Criminal Than Churchill, Truman,
and LBJ*
"It's time to recover the truth about Stalin and the USSR from a cesspool
of hostile propaganda"
We have long maintained that the truth about the USSR, in general, and
particularly the Stalin period, has long been the object of the most
cynical, mean-spirited, and comprehensive propaganda effort ever seen in
the annals of history.
For reasons of sheer class interest among the plutocrats of the West, the
business elites that still rule most of the so-called “capitalist
democracies,” the demonization of Stalin was a necessity, a campaign only
briefly interrupted by World War Two and quickly resumed literally a few
hours after its ending.
The Western elites —with the American ruling circles in the lead—correctly
saw an enemy in Stalin. They could not bribe him and they could not
intimidate him. Nor could they easily topple him, as they had done (and
still do) countless times with weaker, “inconvenient leaders.” What’s more,
Stalin was at the helm of a powerful nation and titular leader of an
ideology directly opposed to their indispensable economic system.
Occasional diplomacy aside, they hated him. He and his nation stood in the
way of their plans for global hegemony. So the the venom had to flow and
did—abundantly. And in that sordid enterprise the capitalist elites found
countless allies, not to mention the usual battalions of ignorant, useful
As any propaganda student will attest, when vilifying a nation’s policies
and social values, it’s far easier (and effective) if the propagandist aims
the Big Lie machine at its leader. As we have seen in recent times with
Gaddafi, Saddam Hussein, Bashar al-Assad, Fidel Castro, Iran and North
Korea’s leaders, Venezuela’s Hugo Chavez, and finally Putin—among many
others (the empire is never lacking in “dangerous enemies”)—the character
assassination of a leader is an old tactic to prepare the perennially
benighted home population for an attack on the targeted nation.
Truth could swiftly complete the total demonization of Vladimir Putin—a
figure in good standing merely 3 years ago—and not even an avowed
socialist, one can only imagine what outrageous fabrications they could
have concocted (and did) to cordon off the image of Stalin, an outspoken
communist, over several decades. This made eminent sense to the West’s
doctrinal gatekeepers. Given the identification of Stalin’s long rule with
the Soviet Union at its most embattled, the blackening of Stalin’s name
served an important purpose: it provided the Western propagandists an
invaluable shorthand—an “irrefutable symbol” of communism’s putative
evil—to block the very idea of genuine socialism as an option for humanity.
The preceding is obviously not to argue that Stalin was a flawless leader,
or a saint who just happened to have a powerful army, or that he didn’t
make some serious mistakes. He did. However, the most elementary fairness
demands that we ask, which world historical figure confronted with
enormously difficult choices emerges today (barring self-serving
ideological propaganda) unscathed from close and impartial examination?
Judging Stalin by the context in which he had to act, and even more
important, the purposes he served, he was arguably no worse, morally, than
most Western leaders, and by any rational measure, probably a damn sight
better.  For who are these distinguished gentlemen who have led the West
for over a century now?
Churchill, the most revered member in the club, was an unapologetic racist
and imperialist who in the 1920s endorsed the policy of RAF bombing and
gassing Iraqi villages (Mesopotamia) into submission, for for failure to
pay their assigned tribute. JFK, Lyndon Johnson, and Nixon pursued an
illegitimate, barbaric, genocidal war in Vietnam that remains one of the
horrors of modern imperialism. Truman dropped the bomb on the Japanese as a
way to keep the Soviets “in line,” making America so far the only nation to
have used nuclear weapons on a civilian population. And during the postwar,
the US tentacles, chiefly acting through the CIA and its clients, have
managed to murder and repress tens of millions of people around the
globe—in all latitudes and scores of nations, from the Philippines, to
Indonesia to Chile, to Nicaragua, to Iran, the Congo, Korea, the entire
Middle East, literally bathed in blood—always in pursuit of geostrategic
advantage, and the suppression of popular democracy in order to better
permit the continuation and maximization of corporate profit. So much for
the inherent perfidy of communism and angelic innocence of capitalism.
The record is by now so huge and consistent, the hypocrisy so staggering,
that we can state categorically there is not a single case in which America
has used its immense diplomatic and military power to back a genuine
democratic leader (such people are immediately branded “communists” and
dealt accordingly) or assisted people struggling for freedom from class
oppression. It’s a vile and hypocritical record that continues to this day,
thanks to the complete brainwash to which the American population has been
subjected as a measure of pre-emptive pacification. The whole thing is
amply documented so there’s no point in even trying to refute it.
In any case, recovering the truth about Stalin and the USSR from the
cesspool of hostile propaganda in which the enemies of socialism situated
it, assisted by the perennially misguided and often fanatical
anti-communist and especially anti-Stalinist leftists, is no task for the
That’s why we salute our colleagues at Russia Insider, and its editor,
Charlie Bausman, in particular, for their decision to publish Grover Furr.
Letting this scholar speak to a larger audience is a badly needed blow for
truth —especially in the current context of reckless warmongering on
Russia’s and China’s doorstep. The Big Lie must be defeated if a lasting
peace is ever to be attained by humanity.

supports UEFI (it was added a few months ago for the first time to support
encryption for the new Bios type machines). It's still not mature at
all.... so give it at least 6 more months to become stable.
*The bottom line of the audit (except the UEFI):*
It means that the core code/90% of the features in VeraCrypt are absolutely
strong and great, including encryption of Legacy Bios machines and creating
separated encrypted volumes.

Oh, johny, johny... poor johny... you fought Juan and you totally lost, so
now you came back to bite Zen.... you hate Zenaan and the Truth he spreads
so much that you must bite him again and again and again. But the problem
is - YOU ARE A SLANDERER, johny! A fucken SLANDERER!
For the record - Zen has NEVER denied the holocaust, you cock sucker. NEVER!
He published ONE political-historical essay that discussed about A LOT of
things and ....  that was published on some holocaust denier site.. and
TA-DAM... johny new-man (dick-man) took it as the ONLY and the MAJOR hook
he's got on Zen and now he bites him with it every Monday and Saturday.
You piece of stupid scum, johny.
And whenever i see your post/someone qoutes you, i get a vomit reflex,
because i know it's gonna be super stupid or super ugly (the same refers to
Tanaka's posts, by the way).
So i repeat my reply to one of your attacks on Zen:
SHUT THE FUCK UP and leave this Great Human Being with the name "Zenaan".

CypherPunks ,  Cryptome *Mendacious War Criminal Obama’s Final Speech To The UN General Assembly*
by Dr Gideon Polya (*) — CounterCurrents — September 24, 2016
America’s mendacious, serial invader,  war criminal, climate criminal and
human rights-violating  President Barack Obama made his last speech to the
UN General Assembly on 20 September 2016, a speech characterized by massive
lying by omission that is far, far worse than lying by commission because
the latter can at least be  refuted and subject to public debate. As
revealed by Edward Snowden, America spies on everyone in America and the
world, but Obama managed to comprehensively ignore a veritable Herd of
Elephants in the Room as detailed in the following analysis of his last UN
speech. As Dr Paul Craig Roberts has stated: “Washington lies about
The transcript of President Obama’s final speech to the UN [1] is
reproduced  below with key matters he has ignored set out succinctly in
square brackets, together with appropriate detailed documentation.
*PRESIDENT OBAMA:  *
   1. Mr. President; Mr. Secretary General; fellow delegates; ladies and
   gentlemen:  As I address this hall as President for the final time, let me
   recount the progress that we’ve made these last eight years.
[The atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased to 405 ppm CO2 and is
increasing at a record 3 ppm CO2 per year; a catastrophic plus 2C
temperature rise is now unavoidable, plus 1.5C may occur by 2020,  and the
current plus 1C is already catastrophic for tropical Island States and
megadelta countries like Bangladesh [2];  the coal-to-gas conversion by the
US under Obama locks in disastrous long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution
[3]; 17 million people die avoidably from deprivation each year, about half
of them children [4]; 7 million die from air pollution each year [5, 6];
the US Alliance has invaded 20 overwhelmingly or significantly Muslim
countries since the US Government’s 9-11 false flag atrocity, this being
associated with 32 million Muslim deaths from violence (5 million) or from
war- or hegemony-imposed deprivation (27 million) [7, 8] ].
   1. From the depths of the greatest financial crisis of our time, we
   coordinated our response to avoid further catastrophe and return the global
   economy to growth.  We’ve taken away terrorist safe havens, strengthened
   the nonproliferation regime, resolved the Iranian nuclear issue through
   diplomacy.  We opened relations with Cuba, helped Colombia end Latin
   America’s longest war, and we welcome a democratically elected leader of
   Myanmar to this Assembly.  Our assistance is helping people feed
   themselves, care for the sick, power communities across Africa, and promote
   models of development rather than dependence.  And we have made
   international institutions like the World Bank and the International
   Monetary Fund more representative, while establishing a framework to
   protect our planet from the ravages of climate change.
[US-complicit military coups in Honduras, Ukraine and Egypt; US-complicit
parliamentary coup in Brazil; US Alliance military intervention in 20
countries this century associated with the active or passive killing of 32
million Muslims[4, 7, 9-12] ; after the Global Financial Crisis the US
rewarded the banker criminals whereas Iceland sent them all to jail; the US
Alliance devastated Libya, formerly the richest country in Africa, and
devastated secular Syria, converting half the population to refugees in a
country that was formerly the world’s leading country for per capita
hosting of refugees [9]; the US Alliance  created ISIS in Iraq [11] and
backed ISIS in Syria against  the secular Assad Government in the interests
of Apartheid Israel, US hegemony and a “Sunni gas pipeline” from Qatar to
the Mediterranean [13]; while Iran has no nuclear weapons and declares it
does not want them, US-backed Apartheid Israel has as many as 400 nuclear
weapons and acquired them with US assistance [14]].
   1. This is important work.  It has made a real difference in the lives
   of our people.  And it could not have happened had we not worked together.
   And yet, around the globe we are seeing the same forces of global
   integration that have made us interdependent also expose deep fault lines
   in the existing international order.
[Under the existing international order 17 million people die avoidably
from deprivation each year on Spaceship Earth with a Neocon American and
Zionist  Imperialist (NAZI)-beholden US Government  in charge of the flight
deck [4]; America with 4% of the world’s population consumes 25% of its
resources; the variously dissident BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India,
China and South Africa) have moved toward an alternative, radical
proposition derived from the American Declaration of Independence,
specifically  that “all men are created equal”].
   1. We see it in the headlines every day.  Around the world, refugees
   flow across borders in flight from brutal conflict.  Financial disruptions
   continue to weigh upon our workers and entire communities.  Across vast
   swaths of the Middle East, basic security, basic order has broken down.  We
   see too many governments muzzling journalists, and quashing dissent, and
   censoring the flow of information.  Terrorist networks use social media to
   prey upon the minds of our youth, endangering open societies and spurring
   anger against innocent immigrants and Muslims.  Powerful nations contest
   the constraints placed on them by international law.
[There are 65 million refugees in the world today, half being  Muslims
fleeing genocidal US Alliance wars in their countries [9]; the US and US
Alliance countries are exceptionalist, ignore international law and
currently invade some 20 impoverished and largely or substantially Muslim
countries at will [7, 9]; the Obama Administrations and their lackey US
Alliance countries  have been complicit in  “muzzling journalists, and
quashing dissent, and censoring the flow of information” as illustrated by
the conduct of US –backed regimes throughout the world, through  the
“manufacturing consent” by compliant US and US Alliance Mainstream media
[15-17], and, notoriously,  by the US in relation to remorselessly
pursuing  the world hero whistle-blowers Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden
and Julian Assange].
   1. This is the paradox that defines our world today.  A quarter century
   after the end of the Cold War, the world is by many measures less violent
   and more prosperous than ever before, and yet our societies are filled with
   uncertainty, and unease, and strife.  Despite enormous progress, as people
   lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions
   between nations become more quick to surface.
[People have lost trust in the mendacity of governments that is well
illustrated by the comprehensive mendacity of the Obama Administrations as
outlined here; the US Center for Public Integrity found that the Bush
Administration told 935 lies between 9-11 and the invasion of Iraq [18];
Pullitzer Prize-wining journalist Seymour Hersh dismissed Obama’s “official
story” of the extra-judicial killing of Osama bin-Laden as a  pack of lies
except for the killing [19] – Dr Paul Craig Roberts went one further and
stated that even the asserted killing of Osama bin-Laden was a lie [20];
numerous science, engineering, architecture, aviation, military and
intelligence experts reject the “lying Bush official version” of 9-11 [8]
but Obama  accepts it , strongly opposed release of documents revealing
Saudi complicity in 9-11, and is resolutely opposed to legislation allowing
the relatives of  9-11 victims to sue foreign governments over their loss;
lying and secrecy mean that Obama and the US Establishment are accessories
after the fact of the  9-11 atrocity].
   1. And so I believe that at this moment we all face a choice. We can
   choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and
   integration.  Or we can retreat into a world sharply divided, and
   ultimately in conflict, along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race
   and religion.
[The US has long rejected “age-old lines of nation” in relation to other
nations, and since 1776 has invaded over 70 nations [21]; with US troops on
the ground in Syria, the US presently has military bases in 75 nations
[23]; the US Alliance has been invading and devastating Muslim countries
since the US Government’s 9-11 false flag atrocity, this being associated
with 32 million Muslim deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or
hegemony-imposed deprivation (27 million) [7, 9]; the Neocon American and
Zionist  Imperialist (NAZI)-perverted and subverted US backs nuclear
terrorist, racist  Zionist (RZ)-run, genocidally racist,
democracy-by-genocide Apartheid Israel  that is obscenely based “along
age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion”;  the  long-term
accrual cost of US support for Apartheid Israel is at least $40 trillion
[24]; in one of his last acts as president, Obama announced a $38 billion
military package for serial war criminal Apartheid Israel over the next
decade [25]].
   1. I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward, and not
   backward.  I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open
   markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights and
   international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for
   human progress in this century.  I make this argument not based on theory
   or ideology, but on facts — facts that all too often, we forget in the
   immediacy of current events.
[The “open markets” espoused by Obama is theory and ideology;  Professor
Lord Nicholas Stern has described climate change inaction as the greatest
market failure in human history [26]; the presently dominant economic
ideology of neoliberalism means maximizing the freedom of the smart and
advantaged to exploit natural and human resources for private profit [27,
28], and has evidently failed, as evidenced by a continuing financial
crisis, a  worsening climate emergency (already catastrophic for some
countries) and a worsening climate genocide that will see 10 billion people
perishing this century if climate change is not requisitely addressed [29]].
   1. Here’s the most important fact:  The integration of our global
   economy has made life better for billions of men, women and children.  Over
   the last 25 years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been
   cut from nearly 40 percent of humanity to under 10 percent.  That’s
   unprecedented.  And it’s not an abstraction.  It means children have enough
   to eat; mothers don’t die in childbirth..
[According to World Hunger: “ The United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization estimates that about 795 million people of the 7.3 billion
people in the world, or one in nine, were suffering from chronic
undernourishment in 2014-2016. Almost all the hungry people, 780 million,
live in developing countries, representing 12.9 percent, or one in eight,
of the population of developing counties” [30], i.e. in 2014-2016 about 11%
of the world suffered chronic undernourishment. 17 million people  die
avoidably each year from deprivation in the Developing World minus China ,
about half being children [4]. According to the World Bank “According to
the most recent estimates, in 2012, 12.7 percent of the world’s population
lived at or below $1.90 a day. That’s down from 37 percent in 1990 and 44
percent in 1981. This means that, in 2012, 896 million people lived on less
than $1.90 a day, compared with 1.95 billion in 1990, and 1.99 billion in
1981 ” [31] ].
   1. Meanwhile, cracking the genetic code promises to cure diseases that
   have plagued us for centuries.  The Internet can deliver the entirety of
   human knowledge to a young girl in a remote village on a single hand-held
   device.  In medicine and in manufacturing, in education and communications,
   we’re experiencing a transformation of how human beings live on a scale
   that recalls the revolutions in agriculture and industry.  And as a result,
   a person born today is more likely to be healthy, to live longer, and to
   have access to opportunity than at any time in human history.
[Obama’s optimistic Eurocentric vision does not apply to the Third Word in
which 17 million people die avoidably from deprivation and
deprivation-exacerbated disease each year [4]; there is a worsening climate
genocide that will see 10 billion people perishing this century if climate
change is not requisitely addressed [29]].
   1. Moreover, the collapse of colonialism and communism has allowed more
   people than ever before to live with the freedom to choose their leaders.
   Despite the real and troubling areas where freedom appears in retreat, the
   fact remains that the number of democracies around the world has nearly
   doubled in the last 25 years.
[Obama as a serial war criminal and serial invader has an appalling record
of denying numerous nations “the freedom to choose their leaders” – under
Obama the US Alliance has invaded 20 overwhelmingly or significantly Muslim
countries since  the US Government’s 9-11 false flag atrocity, this ongoing
Muslim Holocaust and Muslim Genocide being associated with 32 million
Muslim deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or hegemony-imposed
deprivation (27 million) since the US Government’s 9-11 false-flag atrocity
in 2001 [7-9]; under Obama the US has backed the removal of
democratically-elected government in Honduras and the Ukraine and of a
democratically-elected president in Brazil; under Obama the US continues to
subvert every nation on earth; most democracies are faux democracies in
which Big Money has replaced Democracy with Plutocracy, Kleptocracy,
Murdochracy, Lobbyocracy, Corporatocracy and Dollarocracy in which Big
Money purchases people, politicians, parties, public perception of reality,
political power and thence more private profit – with much of this Big
Money coming from tax-avoiding US corporations].
   1. In remote corners of the world, citizens are demanding respect for
   the dignity of all people no matter their gender, or race, or religion, or
   disability, or sexual orientation, and those who deny others dignity are
   subject to public reproach.  An explosion of social media has given
   ordinary people more ways to express themselves, and has raised people’s
   expectations for those of us in power.  Indeed, our international order has
   been so successful that we take it as a given that great powers no longer
   fight world wars; that the end of the Cold War lifted the shadow of nuclear
   Armageddon; that the battlefields of Europe have been replaced by peaceful
   union; that China and India remain on a path of remarkable growth.
[The overwhelmingly dominant One Percenter-owned Mainstream media are still
deceiving the  people and “manufacturing consent” [15]; the nuclear threat
remains – the upper  estimates of stored  nuclear weapons  are as follows:
US (7,315), Russia (8,000), Apartheid Israel (400), France (300), UK (250),
China (250), Pakistan (120), India (100), and North Korea (less than 10)
[32]; under Obama the US backed a neo-Nazi coup in the Ukraine and has
escalated military  confrontation in Eastern Europe leading to serious
fears of a nuclear and terminal WW3 [33, 34]; the rapid economic growth  of
the populous countries China and India means that CO2 pollution is
increasing at a record 3 ppm CO2 per year, although the annual per capita
greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution in tonnes CO2-equivalent  per person per
year is 8.9 (world average), 41.0 (US), 7.4 (China) and 2.1 (India) [35,
   1. I say all this not to whitewash the challenges we face, or to suggest
   complacency.  Rather, I believe that we need to acknowledge these
   achievements in order to summon the confidence to carry this progress
   forward and to make sure that we do not abandon those very things that have
   delivered this progress.
[See point  Obama is whitewashing the nuclear, poverty and climate
change threats [32, 33] – indeed Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)
should be applied against the worst GHG polluting countries [35, 36] and
all countries that refuse to join the present 127  nations who support the
Nuclear Weapons Ban [34]].
   1. In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the
   existing path to global integration requires a course correction.  As too
   often, those trumpeting the benefits of globalization have ignored
   inequality within and among nations; have ignored the enduring appeal of
   ethnic and sectarian identities; have left international institutions
   ill-equipped, underfunded, under-resourced, in order to handle
   transnational challenges.
[Obama is egregiously guilty of such “ignoring” e.g. ignoring the   17
million people who die avoidably from deprivation each year, about half of
them children [4] and, within the US,  the over 27% of African Americans
who live in poverty [37]].
   1. And as these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions
   of the world have pressed forward both in the wealthiest countries and in
   the poorest:  Religious fundamentalism; the politics of ethnicity, or
   tribe, or sect; aggressive nationalism; a crude populism — sometimes from
   the far left, but more often from the far right — which seeks to restore
   what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination.
[Under serial invader and serial war criminal Obama an “exceptionalist” US
has continued   “aggressive nationalism” with the US Alliance invading  20
overwhelmingly or significantly Muslim countries since  the US Government’s
9-11 false flag atrocity, this being associated with 32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or hegemony-imposed
deprivation (27 million) [7, 8] ]; “religious fundamentalism; the politics
of ethnicity, or tribe, or sect; aggressive nationalism; a crude populism”
are exhibited by US-backed, nuclear terrorist, racist Zionist-run,
genocidally racist, democracy-by-genocide, neo-Nazi Apartheid Israel in its
ongoing Palestinian Genocide [10] and its powerful espousal  via the
Zionist Lobby of the ongoing Muslim Holocaust and Muslim Genocide [7-9, 11,
   1. We cannot dismiss these visions.  They are powerful.  They reflect
   dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens.  I do not believe those
   visions can deliver security or prosperity over the long term, but I do
   believe that these visions fail to recognize, at a very basic level, our
   common humanity.  Moreover, I believe that the acceleration of travel and
   technology and telecommunications — together with a global economy that
   depends on a global supply chain — makes it self-defeating ultimately for
   those who seek to reverse this progress.  Today, a nation ringed by walls
   would only imprison itself.
[“Dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens” – the “too many”  have an
awful lot to  be dissatisfied about both globally and domestically in the
US. Thus globally nearly 1 billion live in dire poverty and suffer chronic
malnourishment [30, 31] with 17 million dying  from deprivation annually,
about half being children [4], and the Muslim world subject to a Muslim
Holocaust and Muslim Genocide in which  there have been  32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or hegemony-imposed
deprivation (27 million) since the US Government’s 9-11 false-flag atrocity
in 2001 [7, 8]. Domestically, 1.7 million Americans die preventably each
year, this carnage being inescapably linked to the fiscal perversions of
the $40 trillion long-term accrual cost of Apartheid Israel to America [38]
and successive  Neocon American and Zionist Imperialist  (NAZI)-perverted
 Administrations  committing trillions of dollars to killing Muslims abroad
in the War on Terror (the War on Muslims) rather than keeping Americans
alive at home [39]. American incomes have flat-lined for decades of course,
as for African Americans under America’s  first black president, 27% live
in poverty, *African American wealth is about 5 times lower  than that of
 Whites, millions of African Americans are excluded from voting, African
Americans are 8 times more likely to murder and 6 times more likely to be
murdered than Whites, Educational Apartheid has meant return of Segregation
with a vengeance, and African Americans  and Hispanic Americans  have
 about half their “fair share” of representatives  in Congress and 5-6
times less Congressional  representation than  Jewish Americans (despite
being collectively about 10 times more population-wise) [37]].*
   1. So the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration.
   Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such
   integration are broadly shared, and that the disruptions — economic,
   political, and cultural — that are caused by integration are squarely
   addressed.  This is not the place for a detailed policy blueprint, but let
   me offer in broad strokes those areas where I believe we must do better
   together.
[“Global integration” means that manufacturing jobs go to where the wages
are lowest in a new version of slavery that ignores the fundamental human
right to a decent life. The British (a) abolished slavery in Britain when
rural  Enclosures generated the effective slavery of a minimum wage
industrial working class; (b) later replaced slavery in the British
colonies by minimally paid “indentured labour” (e.g. the “5-year slavery of
Indian indentured labour in Fiji that finally ceased in 1922 [40] ); and
(c) today exploit Third World labour by the effective slavery of “global
integration” ].
   1. It starts with making the global economy work better for all people
   and not just for those at the top.  While open markets, capitalism have
   raised standards of living around the globe, globalization combined with
   rapid progress and technology has also weakened the position of workers and
   their ability to secure a decent wage.  In advanced economies like my own,
   unions have been undermined, and many manufacturing jobs have disappeared.
   Often, those who benefit most from globalization have used their political
   power to further undermine the position of workers.
[In the US the average wage has flat-lined in real terms for decades  but
the One Percenter and Ten Percenter share of annual income has steadily
increased for decades, this phenomenon also obtaining  elsewhere in the
Anglosphere [41-43].
   1. In developing countries, labor organizations have often been
   suppressed, and the growth of the middle class has been held back by
   corruption and underinvestment.  Mercantilist policies pursued by
   governments with export-driven models threaten to undermine the consensus
   that underpins global trade.  And meanwhile, global capital is too often
   unaccountable — nearly $8 trillion stashed away in tax havens, a shadow
   banking system that grows beyond the reach of effective oversight.
[US corporations are massively involved in egregious global tax avoidance
which contributes to the inequity that in turn drives the Global Avoidable
Mortality  Holocaust in which 17 million people die avoidably from
deprivation every year [4]. By backing anti-democratic neofascist and
neoliberal regimes around the world, America, including the US under Obama,
 massively  contributes to suppression of labour organizations].
   1. A world in which one percent of humanity controls as much wealth as
   the other 99 percent will never be stable.  I understand that the gaps
   between rich and poor are not new, but just as the child in a slum today
   can see the skyscraper nearby, technology now allows any person with a
   smartphone to see how the most privileged among us live and the contrast
   between their own lives and others.  Expectations rise, then, faster than
   governments can deliver, and a pervasive sense of injustice undermine
   people’s faith in the system.
[But in harsh reality Obama is part of the One Percent,  represents the One
Percent politically  and is dedicated to the deceit, manipulation and
variously egregiously violent suppression of the 99%].
   1. So how do we fix this imbalance?  We cannot unwind integration any
   more than we can stuff technology back into a box.  Nor can we look to
   failed models of the past.  If we start resorting to trade wars, market
   distorting subsidies, beggar thy neighbor policies, an overreliance on
   natural resources instead of innovation — these approaches will make us
   poorer, collectively, and they are more like to lead to conflict.  And the
   stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the
   wasteland of North Korea shows that central, planned control of the economy
   is a dead end.
[Professor Thomas Piketty in his seminal book “Capital  in the Twenty-First
Century” argues that gross inequity damages democracy (Big Money buys
votes) and damages the economy (the poor cannot afford to buy the goods and
services they produce) . Piketty argues for wealth transparency and  a
global annual wealth tax of up to 10% [41, 42], noting that France has an
annual wealth tax of up to 1.5% and Islam has had an annual wealth tax of
2.5% (zakkat) for 1,400 years [43].   It is estimated that an annual
 global wealth tax of 4% could abolish the Global Avoidable Mortality
 Holocaust and prevent  17 million people from dying  avoidably from
deprivation every year  – an annual global wealth tax of about 4% would
yield US$16 trillion annually and enable raising all countries to annual
per capita incomes equivalent to the $6,000 per person per year of China
and Cuba, countries for which annual avoidable mortality is zero (0) [44].
One can well understand why One Percenter Obama ignores the wealth tax
option. As for North Korea, it has been subject to frightening military
hostility from the genocidally violent US for about 70 years, and US
bombing in 1950-1953 killed 28% of the population [45]].
   1. But I do believe there’s another path — one that fuels growth and
   innovation, and offers the clearest route to individual opportunity and
   national success.  It does not require succumbing to a soulless capitalism
   that benefits only the few, but rather recognizes that economies are more
   successful when we close the gap between rich and poor, and growth is
   broadly based. And that means respecting the rights of workers so they can
   organize into independent unions and earn a living wage.  It means
   investing in our people — their skills, their education, their capacity to
   take an idea and turn it into a business.  It means strengthening the
   safety net that protects our people from hardship and allows them to take
   more risks — to look for a new job, or start a new venture.
[Great rhetoric from a neoliberal, corporatist, One Percenter president
Obama  under whom 1.7 million Americans die preventably every year [39]].
   1. These are the policies that I’ve pursued here in the United States,
   and with clear results.  American businesses have created now 15 million
   new jobs.  After the recession, the top one percent of Americans were
   capturing more than 90 percent of income growth.  But today, that’s down to
   about half.  Last year, poverty in this country fell at the fastest rate in
   nearly 50 years.  And with further investment in infrastructure and early
   childhood education and basic research, I’m confident that such progress
   will continue.
[One Percenter Obama is boasting that the One Percenters “only” captured
45% of income growth after the recession].
   1. So just as I’ve pursued these measures here at home, so has the
   United States worked with many nations to curb the excesses of capitalism —
   not to punish wealth, but to prevent repeated crises that can destroy it.
   That’s why we’ve worked with other nations to create higher and clearer
   standards for banking and taxation — because a society that asks less of
   oligarchs than ordinary citizens will rot from within.  That’s why we’ve
   pushed for transparency and cooperation in rooting out corruption, and
   tracking illicit dollars, because markets create more jobs when they’re
   fueled by hard work, and not the capacity to extort a bribe.  That’s why
   we’ve worked to reach trade agreements that raise labor standards and raise
   environmental standards, as we’ve done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
   so that the benefits are more broadly shared.
[The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is supported by US corporations but
opposed by both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton because  it will export
American jobs to low wage countries. The TPP is opposed by thoughtful
pro-environment people in the Pacific Rim  because it will enable US
corporations to successfully sue governments for losses due to
pro-environment legislation and other  pro-environment actions].
   1. And just as we benefit by combating inequality within our countries,
   I believe advanced economies still need to do more to close the gap between
   rich and poor nations around the globe.  This is difficult politically.
   It’s difficult to spend on foreign assistance.  But I do not believe this
   is charity.  For the small fraction of what we spent at war in Iraq we
   could support institutions so that fragile states don’t collapse in the
   first place, and invest in emerging economies that become markets for our
   goods.  It’s not just the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do.
[For the serial war criminal US to stop  perverting, subverting,  invading
and devastating “fragile states” would be an obvious way of preventing them
from collapsing. Thus the US Alliance under Obama has been war criminally
 invading and devastating 20 substantially or significantly  Muslim
countries,  impoverished nations in which 32 million Muslims have died from
violence (5 million) or from hegemony- and war-imposed deprivation (27
million) since 2001 [4, 7, 9]. The US-led France, UK and US (FUKUS)
Coalition  devastated Libya (0.1 million dead, 1 million refugees).  Libya
was formerly  the richest country in Africa [4, 7, 9]].
   1. And that’s why we need to follow through on our efforts to combat
   climate change.  If we don’t act boldly, the bill that could come due will
   be mass migrations, and cities submerged and nations displaced, and food
   supplies decimated, and conflicts born of despair.  The Paris Agreement
   gives us a framework to act, but only if we scale up our ambition.  And
   there must be a sense of urgency about bringing the agreement into force,
   and helping poorer countries leapfrog destructive forms of energy.
[The atmospheric CO2 concentration is now 405 ppm CO2 and increasing at a
record 3 ppm CO2 per year; the species extinction rate is now 100-1,000
times greater than normal, this giving rise to the term Anthropocene to
 describe the present era and the speciescide and ecocide, leading to
omnicide and terracide – the killing of our  Living Planet;  coral reefs
are hugely important ocean ecosystems,  but they started bleaching
worldwide when the atmospheric CO2 reached 320 ppm CO2, are endangered at
the current 405 ppm CO2,  and are essentially doomed in a mere 15 years’
time at the 450 ppm CO2  predicted from the current increase at 3 ppm CO2
per year. The annual per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution in tonnes
CO2-equivalent  per person per year is 8.9 (world average), 41.0 (US), 7.4
(China) and 2.1 (India)  [35, 36]. Paris-recognized as catastrophic, a plus
2C temperature rise is now unavoidable and the present circa plus 1C is
already disastrous for tropical Island Nations and tropical mega-delta
countries like Bangladesh [1, 2]. Indeed the lower Paris “target” of no
more than plus 1.5C may be exceeded as early as 2020 [46]]. Under Obama the
US has embarked on a massive coal-to-gas transition that locks in dirty
energy for decades and due to systemic gas leakage, gas burning for power
 could be dirtier GHG-wise than coal burning [47-50].
   1. So, for the wealthiest countries, a Green Climate Fund should only be
   the beginning.  We need to invest in research and provide market incentives
   to develop new technologies, and then make these technologies accessible
   and affordable for poorer countries.  And only then can we continue lifting
   all people up from poverty without condemning our children to a planet
   beyond their capacity to repair.
[Not mentioned by Obama, we urgently need to stop burning carbon fuels,
deforestation, methanogenic livestock production and population growth now.
It is already too late to avoid massive damage.  “Condemning our children
to a planet beyond their capacity to repair” has effectively already
happened. Thus assuming a damage-related Carbon Price in US Dollars of
$200 per tonne CO2-equivalent  (as estimated by Dr Chris Hope of
 90-Nobel-Laureate University of Cambridge),  the World has n inescapable
Carbon Debt of $360 trillion that is increasing at $13 trillion per year,
and, for example,  US lackey, climate criminal Australia, a world-leader in
annual per capita greenhouse (GHG) gas pollution,  has a Carbon Debt of
$7.5 trillion that is increasing at $400 billion per year and at $40,000
per head per year for under-30 year old Australians. Young people will
inescapably have to pay this huge and increasing Carbon Debt – thus unless
gigantic 20 meter sea walls are built, coastal cities will drown [47].
Young people  must wise up and demand urgent climate action [51-55] and
indeed a Climate Revolution now! [55]].
   1. So we need new models for the global marketplace, models that are
   inclusive and sustainable.  And in the same way, we need models of
   governance that are inclusive and accountable to ordinary people.
[ What gross deception and hypocrisy by Obama. American policy (“model of
governance”) has always been “might is right” when it comes to exploitable
resources. To that end, the US has invaded 71 countries, has military bases
in 75 and subverts every country on earth.  Thus the Iraq War continued
under Obama and has now transmuted into an endless War on Terror due to the
US-provoked rise of ISIS in Iraq and US Alliance support for this barbarous
terrorist organization in Syria against the secular Assad regime. The US
allies Turkey, Qatar. Apartheid Israel and Saudi Arabia contributed
significantly  to the rise  ISIS in Syria, this being consonant with US
policy to remove the secular Assad regime. Alan Greenspan on the Right and
Noam Chomsky on the Left both say that the Iraq War was about oil. US
Establishment intimate Robert Kennedy Junior says that the Syrian War is in
essence about a “Sunni gas pipeline” from Qatar [13]].
   1. I recognize not every country in this hall is going to follow the
   same model of governance.  I do not think that America can — or should —
   impose our system of government on other countries.  But there appears to
   be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now.  And
   I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest.  I
   believe in a liberal political order — an order built not just through
   elections and representative government, but also through respect for human
   rights and civil society, and independent judiciaries and the rule of law.
[Further egregious hypocrisy. America has repeatedly imposed its “system of
government” on other countries [4, 13, 21]. America  has invaded 71
countries, has military  bases in 75 countries and indeed subverts all
countries in the world. Under war criminal Obama, the US Alliance has
invaded 20 countries  [4, 21-23].   US drone strikes, targeted with the
help of US lackey Australia, are presently  being conducted against Libya,
Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Indeed it seems
likely that world-leading US-Apartheid Israeli drone technology was
involved in the 9-11 attacks on the US itself  (the alternative to this
hypothesis in the lying Bush “official version” of 9-11, to whit  that
people learning to fly tiny, single-engined  aircraft  were able to land
huge  passenger jets at high speed on a dime) [8].  How the US  has
repeatedly “impose[d] our system of government on other countries” was
explained by former CIA operative Philip Agee in his book “CIA Diary.
Inside the Company” in relation  to the US invasion of the Dominican
Republic [4] – invade, and then ban,  imprison, torture, kill or   exile
all those you don’t like and then hold “democratic elections” [56]].
   1. I know that some countries, which now recognize the power of free
   markets, still reject the model of free societies.  And perhaps those of us
   who have been promoting democracy feel somewhat discouraged since the end
   of the Cold War, because we’ve learned that liberal democracy will not just
   wash across the globe in a single wave.  It turns out building accountable
   institutions is hard work — the work of generations.  The gains are often
   fragile.  Sometimes we take one step forward and then two steps back.  In
   countries held together by borders drawn by colonial powers, with ethnic
   enclaves and tribal divisions, politics and elections can sometimes appear
   to be a zero-sum game.  And so, given the difficulty in forging true
   democracy in the face of these pressures, it’s no surprise that some argue
   the future favors the strongman, a top-down model, rather than strong,
   democratic institutions.
[Obama’s “true democracy” in the West has degenerated into  Big
Money-controlled  Plutocracy, Kleptocracy, Murdochracy, Lobbyocracy,
Corporatocracy and Dollarocracy in which Big Money purchases people,
politicians, parties, public perception of reality, political power and
thence more private profit. Fundamentally, democracy is about practical
 expression of the will of the people and in 1-party Cuba the desire of the
people for good  governance, health, and education has been met – despite
decades of war criminal US sanctions, Cuba has excellent health services,
female literacy is high  and infant mortality is the same as in the US [4]].
   1. But I believe this thinking is wrong.  I believe the road of true
   democracy remains the better path.  I believe that in the 21st century,
   economies can only grow to a certain point until they need to open up —
   because entrepreneurs need to access information in order to invent; young
   people need a global education in order to thrive; independent media needs
   to check the abuses of power.  Without this evolution, ultimately
   expectations of people will not be met; suppression and stagnation will set
   in.  And history shows that strongmen are then left with two paths —
   permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies
   abroad, which can lead to war.
[War criminal Obama certainly knows about war – under war criminal Obama
the US Alliance has invaded 20 countries and civilized people dread the
prospect of a Hillary Clinton Administration in which she will set out to
prove that she is a “real man” by following and indeed exceeding Obama’s
murderous example].
   1. Now, I will admit, my belief that governments serve the individual,
   and not the other way around, is shaped by America’s story.  Our nation
   began with a promise of freedom that applied only to the few.  But because
   of our democratic Constitution, because of our Bill of Rights, because of
   our ideals, ordinary people were able to organize, and march, and protest,
   and ultimately, those ideals won out — opened doors for women and
   minorities and workers in ways that made our economy more productive and
   turned our diversity into a strength; that gave innovators the chance to
   transform every area of human endeavor; that made it possible for someone
   like me to be elected President of the United States.
[A blood-thirsty Simon Legree rather than a subservient Uncle Tom, One
Percenter Obama is the willing servant of the Neocon American and Zionist
Imperialist  (NAZI)-dominated One Percenter Establishment running America.
Indeed Obama is a classic example of the embodiment of the dominant
“Whiteness” culture of America.  For  African Americans under America’s
 first Black president, 27% live in poverty, *African American wealth is
about 5 times lower  than that of  Whites, millions of African Americans
are excluded from voting, African Americans are 8 times more likely to
murder and 6 times more likely to be murdered than Whites, Educational
Apartheid has meant return of Segregation with a vengeance, and African
Americans  and Hispanic Americans  have  about half their “fair share” of
representatives  in Congress and 5-6 times less Congressional
 representation than  Jewish Americans (despite being collectively about 10
times more populous) [37]].*
   1. So, yes, my views are shaped by the specific experiences of America,
   but I do not think this story is unique to America.  Look at the
   transformation that’s taken place in countries as different as Japan and
   Chile, Indonesia, Botswana.  The countries that have succeeded are ones in
   which people feel they have a stake.
[However Obama’s asserted support for one-person-one-vote  is contradicted
by his  fanatical  support for nuclear terrorist, racist Zionist-run,
genocidally racist, democracy-by-genocide, neo-Nazi Apartheid Israel that
denies 73% of its now 52% majority of Indigenous Palestinians the right to
vote for the government ruling them. Obama is a genocidal  racist,
anti-Arab anti-Semite  and pathological  liar in his support for Apartheid
Israel in its ongoing Palestinian Genocide [10]].
   1. In Europe, the progress of those countries in the former Soviet bloc
   that embraced democracy stand in clear contrast to those that did not.
   After all, the people of Ukraine did not take to the streets because of
   some plot imposed from abroad.  They took to the streets because their
   leadership was for sale and they had no recourse.  They demanded change
   because they saw life get better for people in the Baltics and in Poland,
   societies that were more liberal, and democratic, and open than their own.
[The neo-Nazi coup that overthrew the democratically elected government  in
the Ukraine was backed by the US].
   1. So those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out
   forcefully, because both the facts and history, I believe, are on our
   side.  That doesn’t mean democracies are without flaws.  It does mean that
   the cure for what ails our democracies is greater engagement by our
   citizens — not less.
[See point  – racist Obama supports Apartheid in Palestine   just as his
racist presidential predecessors supported Apartheid in South Africa [4]].
   1. Yes, in America, there is too much money in politics; too much
   entrenched partisanship; too little participation by citizens, in part
   because of a patchwork of laws that makes it harder to vote.  In Europe, a
   well-intentioned Brussels often became too isolated from the normal push
   and pull of national politics.  Too often, in capitals, decision-makers
   have forgotten that democracy needs to be driven by civic engagement from
   the bottom up, not governance by experts from the top down.  And so these
   are real problems, and as leaders of democratic governments make the case
   for democracy abroad, we better strive harder to set a better example at
   home.
[Under Barack “Simon Legree” Obama, millions of Black Americans are denied
the vote under anti-felony laws and according to Dr Michelle Alexander of
the NAACP, nearly 80% of adult male Black Americans in Chicago are denied
the right to vote [57, 58]].
   1. Moreover, every country will organize its government informed by
   centuries of history, and the circumstances of geography, and the deeply
   held beliefs of its people.  So I recognize a traditional society may value
   unity and cohesion more than a diverse country like my own, which was
   founded upon what, at the time, was a radical idea — the idea of the
   liberty of individual human beings endowed with certain God-given rights.
   But that does not mean that ordinary people in Asia, or Africa, or the
   Middle East somehow prefer arbitrary rule that denies them a voice in the
   decisions that can shape their lives.  I believe that spirit is universal.
   And if any of you doubt the universality of that desire, listen to the
   voices of young people everywhere who call out for freedom, and dignity,
   and the opportunity to control their own lives.
[Unfortunately,  that asserted “liberty of the individual” in the
ostensibly  marvellous 1776 American Declaration of Independence  in
reality was freedom to invade, conquer, devastate and ethnically cleanse
Indigenous American  lands – indeed the real  purpose of the American War
of Independence was not “no taxation without representation” or “personal
liberty” but freedom to exterminate Indigenous Indians that had some
protection from the British in the context of the 18th century Anglo-French
war. [4].  By 1844 the United States, founded on the dream of genocide,
 had legislated to remove all Indigenous Indians from East of the
Mississippi [4]].
   1. This leads me to the third thing we need to do:  We must reject any
   forms of fundamentalism, or racism, or a belief in ethnic superiority that
   makes our traditional identities irreconcilable with modernity.  Instead we
   need to embrace the tolerance that results from respect of all human beings.
[The ultimate expression of racism is war.  Under war criminal Obama, the
US Alliance has invaded 20 countries  [4, 21-23].   US drone strikes,
targetted with the help of  US lackey Australia, are presently  being
conducted against Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and
Pakistan. Obama is one of the worst warmonger and war-making presidents and
hence one of the worst racists in American history  [4]].
   1. It’s a truism that global integration has led to a collision of
   cultures; trade, migration, the Internet, all these things can challenge
   and unsettle our most cherished identities.  We see liberal societies
   express opposition when women choose to cover themselves.  We see protests
   responding to Western newspaper cartoons that caricature the Prophet
   Muhammad.  In a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia
   attempting to recover lost glory through force.  Asian powers debate
   competing claims of history.  And in Europe and the United States, you see
   people wrestle with concerns about immigration and changing demographics,
   and suggesting that somehow people who look different are corrupting the
   character of our countries.
[The people of Crimea overwhelmingly voted for linkage to Russia after the
US-backed neo-Nazi Coup in the Ukraine. Anti-Semite Obama backs the
genocidally  racist,  colonizer,  and  Apartheid rogue state of Israel in
its illegal occupation and ethnic  cleansing of Arab lands].
   1. Now, there’s no easy answer for resolving all these social forces,
   and we must respect the meaning that people draw from their own traditions
   — from their religion, from their ethnicity, from their sense of
   nationhood.  But I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to
   preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate
   another group. If our religion leads us to persecute those of another
   faith, if we jail or beat people who are gay, if our traditions lead us to
   prevent girls from going to school, if we discriminate on the basis of race
   or tribe or ethnicity, then the fragile bonds of civilization will fray.
   The world is too small, we are too packed together, for us to be able to
   resort to those old ways of thinking.
[Obama as a pluralist liberal simply doesn’t wash – he is a racist
 warmonger heading a US Alliance that is making war in 20 impoverished
countries [4, 7-13]].
   1. We see this mindset in too many parts of the Middle East.  There, so
   much of the collapse in order has been fueled because leaders sought
   legitimacy not because of policies or programs but by resorting to
   persecuting political opposition, or demonizing other religious sects, by
   narrowing the public space to the mosque, where in too many places
   perversions of a great faith were tolerated.  These forces built up for
   years, and are now at work helping to fuel both Syria’s tragic civil war
   and the mindless, medieval menace of ISIL.
[ISIL (ISIS) arose directly from the Iraqi Genocide under the Bush and
Obama Administration that involved destruction of a modern state, 2.7
million Iraqi deaths from violence (1.5 million) or from war-imposed
deprivation (1.2 million), and massive disempowerment of the Iraqi Sunni
minority. The US created ISIS just as it created Al Qaeda and the Taliban.
ISIS in Syria has been enabled, funded and backed by US Alliance  members
 Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia in particular. Muslim-origin non-state
terrorism  is the greatest ally of US imperialism – every mindless atrocity
against Westerners is used as an excuse for vastly more deadly  US Alliance
attacks on Muslim populations in 20 countries from the Western Sahel to
South East Asia. ISIS and similar groups have enabled US or US Alliance
military domination over  a huge swathe of the Muslim world.
   1. The mindset of sectarianism, and extremism, and blood-letting, and
   retribution that has been taking place will not be quickly reversed.  And
   if we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able
   to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to co-exist
   for long.  But I do believe we have to be honest about the nature of these
   conflicts, and our international community must continue to work with those
   who seek to build rather than to destroy.
[ America under anti-Arab anti-Semitic warmonger Obama has devastated a
swathe of Muslim countries [4, 7-13]].
   1. And there is a military component to that.  It means being united and
   relentless in destroying networks like ISIL, which show no respect for
   human life.  But it also means that in a place like Syria, where there’s no
   ultimate military victory to be won, we’re going to have to pursue the hard
   work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence, and deliver aid to those
   in need, and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see
   those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.
[How disingenuous of  Obama to say “and there is a military  component to
that” in relation to his false assertion that the US and its allies “seek
to build rather than to destroy”. Obama seeks to change the government of
Syria and its efforts have killed 0.5 million Syrians, generated 12 million
refugees, and devastated what was once a peaceful, tolerant , secular
society in which numerous ancient faiths and sects got along peacefully
with each other as described  in William Dalrymple’s superb book “From the
Holy Mountain” [59]].
   1. Across the region’s conflicts, we have to insist that all parties
   recognize a common humanity and that nations end proxy wars that fuel
   disorder.  Because until basic questions are answered about how communities
   co-exist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human
   beings will suffer — most of all in that region — but extremism will
   continue to be exported overseas.  And the world is too small for us to
   simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own
   societies.
[The worst extremism being “exported overseas” is US imperialism  and US
Alliance imperialism. The casus belli (excuse for war) is provided by
US-created or US-provoked Muslim-origin non-state terrorists such as the
barbarous ISIS whose outrageous conduct (beheadings, sex slaves, forced
conversions, religious fanaticism, and  religious intolerance) could not
have been better scripted by the CIA.  One is reminded of US-lead terrorist
groups in Ecuador who would bomb Catholic churches so that the socialists
would be blamed [56] and similar US-led Gladio atrocities in Europe that
were designed to be blamed on “communists” [60].   Numerous science,
engineering, architecture, medicine, aviation, military and intelligence
experts conclude that the US Government  was responsible for the singular
9-11 atrocity in which 3,000 people died  [8, 22, 61-63]). However
post-9-11 terror hysteria has been used to attack civil liberties in the US
and in the West in general. Reality:  53 American residents were  killed in
America by “terrorists” in the 14 years since 9/11 and the average  US
population in this period was about 304 million (UN Population Division
data). Accordingly, the “empirical annual probability of an American dying
in the US from terrorism” is 53/(14 years x 304 million) =  about 1 in 100
million per year. In contrast, 1.7million American die preventably each
year as the Neocon American and Zionist Imperialist  (NAZI)-subverted US
Government steadfastly looks the other way and scares the population with
saturation terror hysteria propaganda  [64]].
   1. And what is true in the Middle East is true for all of us.  Surely,
   religious traditions can be honored and upheld while teaching young people
   science and math, rather than intolerance. Surely, we can sustain our
   unique traditions while giving women their full and rightful role in the
   politics and economics of a nation.  Surely, we can rally our nations to
   solidarity while recognizing equal treatment for all communities — whether
   it’s a religious minority in Myanmar, or an ethnic minority in Burundi, or
   a racial minority right here in the United States.  And surely, Israelis
   and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and
   recognize the legitimacy of Israel, but Israel recognizes that it cannot
   permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land.  We all have to do better
   as leaders in tamping down, rather than encouraging, a notion of identity
   that leads us to diminish others.
[Zionist lackey, anti-Arab anti-Semitic, pro-Apartheid, genocidally racist,
serial war criminal  and pathological liar  Obama obscenely blames the
victim with “Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians
reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel”. The dishonest
political  fiction of a “2-state solution” is now impossible with the
Zionist colonizers having ethnically cleansed 90% of Palestine in an
ongoing Palestinian Genocide by a nuclear terrorist, racist Zionist run,
genocidally racist, democracy by genocide Apartheid Israel that prevents
73% of its now 52%  majority  Indigenous Palestinian population from voting
for the government  ruling it. The racist  Zionists are now considering
only 2 options –  (a) continued Apartheid with 73% of Occupied Palestinians
highly abusively confined to the  Gaza Concentration Camp  or  West Bank
ghettoes or (b) outright genocidal expulsion of all or most Indigenous
Palestinian from Palestine (presently, of 12 million Indigenous
Palestinians about 50% are already totally excluded on pain of death from
living in their own country). Obama is committed to Israeli Apartheid and
the ongoing Palestinian Genocide as the front-man for the Neocon American
and Zionist Imperialist (NAZI)-perverted and subverted  US political
Establishment [10]].
   1. And this leads me to the fourth and final thing we need to do, and
   that is sustain our commitment to international cooperation rooted in the
   rights and responsibilities of nations.
[Obama as a serial invader and serial war criminal tramples on “the rights
and responsibilities of nations”, the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, the Rights of the Child, The UN Genocide Convention, the
Geneva Convention …].
   1. As President of the United States, I know that for most of human
   history, power has not been unipolar.  The end of the Cold War may have led
   too many to forget this truth.  I’ve noticed as President that at times,
   both America’s adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems
   were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington — and
   perhaps too many in Washington believed that as well.  (Laughter.)  But I
   believe America has been a rare superpower in human history insofar as it
   has been willing to think beyond narrow self-interest; that while we’ve
   made our share of mistakes over these last 25 years — and I’ve acknowledged
   some — we have strived, sometimes at great sacrifice, to align better our
   actions with our ideals.  And as a consequence, I believe we have been a
   force for good.
[Utter falsehood by a mendacious Obama who turns history on its head and
 whitewashes decades of utterly evil American war crimes throughout the
world. Under Obama alone the US Alliance has invaded 20 countries in the
 ongoing Muslim Genocide in the 21st century associated with 30 million
Muslim refugees and 32 million Muslim deaths from violence (5 million) or
from hegemony- or war-imposed deprivation (27 million) since the US
Government’s 9-11 false –flag atrocity [7-9]].
   1. We have secured allies.  We’ve acted to protect the vulnerable.  We
   supported human rights and welcomed scrutiny of our own actions.  We’ve
   bound our power to international laws and institutions.  When we’ve made
   mistakes, we’ve tried to acknowledge them.  We have worked to roll back
   poverty and hunger and disease beyond our borders, not just within our
   borders.
[The US under Obama has backed military coups, been associated with
invasions of 20 countries, supported Apartheid and genocide in Palestine,
opposed nuclear disarmament, and grossly violated human rights  at home and
abroad. Under Obama the coal-to-gas conversion by the US under Obama locks
in disastrous long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution and hence climate
change inaction for decades [48, 49],   17 million people die avoidably
from deprivation each year, about half of them children [4], and 7 million
die from air pollution each year [5, 6]. The 3 key threats to humanity are
(a) nuclear weapons, (b) poverty and (c ) climate change but under Obama
(a) the US increased its nuclear threat, continued to back nuclear
terrorist Apartheid Israel and opposed the nuclear weapons ban advocated by
about 130 countries [14]; (b) the US supports poverty-entrenching
 dictatorships, and of about $40 billion in annual US economic plus
military  aid, about $10 billion is military aid (40% to Apartheid Israel)
 and most of the remainder is linked to destructive US military
intervention; and (c) the pro-gas US is one of the worlds worst countries
for  annual per capita GHG pollution in terms of tonnes CO2-equivalent per
person per year (41.0 for the US, 8.9 world average, China 7.4 and India
2.1) and for  “income weighted annual per capita GHG pollution (US 207,
China 5.2 and India 0.3) [35, 36]].
   1. I’m proud of that.  But I also know that we can’t do this alone.  And
   I believe that if we’re to meet the challenges of this century, we are all
   going to have to do more to build up international capacity.  We cannot
   escape the prospect of nuclear war unless we all commit to stopping the
   spread of nuclear weapons and pursuing a world without them.
[ While imposing deadly Sanctions on Iran (that has zero nuclear weapons
and  repeatedly states that it does not want nuclear weapons and wants a
nuclear weapons-free Middle East), the US (7,315 nuclear weapons) is
boosting its nuclear and conventional forces in Asia and Australia, opposes
a nuclear weapons ban,  and continues to pour billions of dollars of
military aid into the war criminal, genocidally racist, ethnic cleansing
and nuclear terrorist rogue state of Apartheid Israel that reportedly has
up to 400 nuclear weapons, this having been acquired with US collaboration.
.  The upper  estimates of stored  nuclear weapons  are as follows: US
(7,315), Russia (8,000), Apartheid Israel (400), France (300), UK (250),
China (250), Pakistan (120), India (100), and North Korea (less than 10)
[14, 34]].
   1. When Iran agrees to accept constraints on its nuclear program that
   enhances global security and enhances Iran’s ability to work with other
   nations.  On the other hand, when North Korea tests a bomb that endangers
   all of us.  And any country that breaks this basic bargain must face
   consequences.  And those nations with these weapons, like the United
   States, have a unique responsibility to pursue the path of reducing our
   stockpiles, and reaffirming basic norms like the commitment to never test
   them again.
[see  The US is a world leader in nuclear terrorism. Iran does not have
nuclear weapons. Obama does not mention Apartheid Israel’s 400 nuclear
weapons [14, 34]].
   1. We can’t combat a disease like Zika that recognizes no borders —
   mosquitos don’t respect walls — unless we make permanent the same urgency
   that we brought to bear against Ebola — by strengthening our own systems of
   public health, by investing in cures and rolling back the root causes of
   disease, and helping poorer countries develop a public health
   infrastructure.
[  The dominant neoliberal ideology  in the US has ensured that
pharmaceutical advance is geared to highly profitable medicines for “White
folks” who can afford to buy them  –  however, the Ebola scare illustrated
how quickly US Big Pharma and medical research can move when “White folks”
are threatened. The efficacy of tens of thousands of medicines have been
determined in exhaustive trials based on “White folks” but their efficacy
has not been determined, for example,  for genetically diverse populations
in Africa].
   1. We can only eliminate extreme poverty if the sustainable development
   goals that we have set are more than words on paper. Human ingenuity now
   gives us the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our children —
   including our girls — the education that is the foundation for opportunity
   in our world.  But we have to put our money where our mouths are.
*[In terms of net official development assistance as “a percentage of gross
national income in 2015”, Sweden ranks top among OECD countries with 1.4%
whereas the US ranks 20th at 0.17% [66]]. *
   1. And we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding —
   to replace the ravages of war with cooperation — if powerful nations like
   my own accept constraints.  Sometimes I’m criticized in my own country for
   professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions.
   But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action —
   not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core
   interests, but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term
   — enhances our security.  And I think that’s not just true for us.
[With breathtaking arrogance Obama is saying that some time in the distant
future the US  might give up “some freedom of action” but it is “not giving
up our ability  … [to] pursue our core interests” i.e. an exceptionalist
 US will continue to subvert, threaten, invade, and devastate other
countries that reached an historical high for America under Nobel Peace
Prize winner but serial invader and serial war criminal Obama].
   1. If Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it
   may be popular at home, it may fuel nationalist fervor for a time, but over
   time it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less
   secure.  In the South China Sea, a peaceful resolution of disputes offered
   by law will mean far greater stability than the militarization of a few
   rocks and reefs.
[Russia responded to the racist, anti-Russian neo-Nazi coup in Ukraine that
was engineered and backed by the North America-located US; the
re-incorporation of strategically vital Crimea into Russia was
overwhelmingly supported by the Crimean population. The South China Sea is
called such  because it is off the coast of South China and not off the
coast of the North America-located US;  under anti-Arab anti-Semitic and
Islamophobic warmonger Obama the  US Alliance headed by the North
America-located US invaded 20 impoverished and distant countries in
pursuance of the Zionist-backed US War on Muslims (War on Terror) that has
been associated with 30 million Muslim refugees and 32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from hegemony- or war-imposed
deprivation (27 million) since the US Government’s 9-11 false –flag
atrocity [7-9]].
   1. We are all stakeholders in this international system, and it calls
   upon all of us to invest in the success of institutions to which we
   belong.  And the good news is, is that many nations have shown what kind of
   progress is possible when we make those commitments.  Consider what we’ve
   accomplished here over the past few years.
[Obama is using weasel words “stakeholders in this international system”
and “invest in the success of institutions” – what the US under Obama
should have been doing was obeying international laws and conventions,
instead of grossly violating these international laws and conventions].
   1. Together, we mobilized some 50,000 additional troops for U.N.
   peacekeeping, making them nimble, better equipped, better prepared to deal
   with emergencies.  Together, we established an Open Government Partnership
   so that, increasingly, transparency empowers more and more people around
   the globe.  And together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to
   help refugees who are desperate for a home.
[“US peace-keeping” is an oxymoron as evidenced by the Zionist–backed US
War on Muslims (War on Terror, Muslim Holocaust, Muslim Genocide) that has
been associated with 30 million Muslim refugees and 32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from hegemony- or war-imposed
deprivation (27 million) since the US Government’s 9-11 false –flag
atrocity [7-9]].
   1. We should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have
   been made at this General Assembly gathering.  I’ll be discussing that more
   this afternoon.  But we have to follow through, even when the politics are
   hard.  Because in the eyes of innocent men and women and children who,
   through no fault of their own, have had to flee everything that they know,
   everything that they love, we have to have the empathy to see ourselves.
   We have to imagine what it would be like for our family, for our children,
   if the unspeakable happened to us.  And we should all understand that,
   ultimately, our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those
   in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to
   accommodating these refugees.
[ Syria was an oasis of peace and religious tolerance and hosted more
refugees per capita that any other country – and then the US and the US
Alliance intervened with bombing and supporting terrorists to remove the
secular Syrian Government, killing 0.5 million people, generating 12
million Syrian refugees, and destroying this ancient country [9]].
   1. There are a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing.
   But many nations — particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits
   of geography — that can do more to offer a hand, even if they also insist
   that refugees who come to our countries have to do more to adapt to the
   customs and conventions of the communities that are now providing them a
   home.
[More breathtaking Obama dishonesty and implicit racism and bigotry; see
 – in terms of net official development assistance as “a percentage of
gross national income in 2015”, Sweden ranks top among OECD countries with
1.4% whereas the US ranks 20th at 0.17% [66]].
   1. Let me conclude by saying that I recognize history tells a different
   story than the one that I’ve talked about here today.  There’s a much
   darker and more cynical view of history that we can adopt.  Human beings
   are too often motivated by greed and by power.  Big countries for most of
   history have pushed smaller ones around.  Tribes and ethnic groups and
   nation states have very often found it most convenient to define themselves
   by what they hate and not just those ideas that bind them together.
[Obama actually tells the truth for once in admitting  his gross mendacity
and saying that “I recognize history tells a different story than the one
that I’ve talked about here today” [4]].
   1. Time and again, human beings have believed that they finally arrived
   at a period of enlightenment only to repeat, then, cycles of conflict and
   suffering.  Perhaps that’s our fate.  We have to remember that the choices
   of individual human beings led to repeated world war.  But we also have to
   remember that the choices of individual human beings created a United
   Nations, so that a war like that would never happen again.  Each of us as
   leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst
   impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best.  For we have shown that
   we can choose a better history.
[The UN was created to prevent  wars like WW2 that was associated with
violent deaths and avoidable deaths from deprivation totalling over 100
million. However US exceptionalism has meant that post-1950 US Asian wars
 have been associated with 40 million Asian deaths from violence or
war-imposed deprivation;1950-2005 avoidable deaths from deprivation in
countries occupied by the US in the post-1945 era have totalled 82 million
[4]; Muslim deaths from violence or imposed deprivation have totalled 32
million since 9-11, with Obama being directly involved in much of this
carnage; there are presently 65 million refugees in the world  of whom 30
million are Muslim refugees generated by a   genocidally  racist US or by
US-backed and genocidally racist Apartheid Israel [9]].
   1. Sitting in a prison cell, a young Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote that,
   “Human progress never rolls on the wheels of inevitability; it comes
   through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God.”
   And during the course of these eight years, as I’ve traveled to many of
   your nations, I have seen that spirit in our young people, who are more
   educated and more tolerant, and more inclusive and more diverse, and more
   creative than our generation; who are more empathetic and compassionate
   towards their fellow human beings than previous generations.  And, yes,
   some of that comes with the idealism of youth.  But it also comes with
   young people’s access to information about other peoples and places — an
   understanding unique in human history that their future is bound with the
   fates of other human beings on the other side of the world.
[Mass murderer, serial invader, serial war criminal and genocidal racist
Obama and his similarly  degenerate and   Zionist-perverted allies can
hardly be called “co-workers with God”].
   1. I think of the thousands of health care workers from around the world
   who volunteered to fight Ebola.  I remember the young entrepreneurs I met
   who are now starting new businesses in Cuba, the parliamentarians who used
   to be just a few years ago political prisoners in Myanmar.  I think of the
   girls who have braved taunts or violence just to go to school in
   Afghanistan, and the university students who started programs online to
   reject the extremism of organizations like ISIL.  I draw strength from the
   young Americans — entrepreneurs, activists, soldiers, new citizens — who
   are remaking our nation once again, who are unconstrained by old habits and
   old conventions, and unencumbered by what is, but are instead ready to
   seize what ought to be.
[How disgusting  that racist mass murderer Obama links himself to
courageous young humanitarians].
   1. My own family is a made up of the flesh and blood and traditions and
   cultures and faiths from a lot of different parts of the world — just as
   America has been built by immigrants from every shore.  And in my own life,
   in this country, and as President, I have learned that our identities do
   not have to be defined by putting someone else down, but can be enhanced by
   lifting somebody else up.  They don’t have to be defined in opposition to
   others, but rather by a belief in liberty and equality and justice and
   fairness.
[When truthful history is written, Obama will be defined by his
participation in the post-9-11 Muslim Holocaust and Muslim Genocide
associated with 30 million Muslim refugees and 32 million Muslim deaths
from violence – or from war - and hegemony-imposed deprivation [9]].
   1. And the embrace of these principles as universal doesn’t weaken my
   particular pride, my particular love for America — it strengthens it.  My
   belief that these ideals apply everywhere doesn’t lessen my commitment to
   help those who look like me, or pray as I do, or pledge allegiance to my
   flag.  But my faith in those principles does force me to expand my moral
   imagination and to recognize that I can best serve my own people, I can
   best look after my own daughters, by making sure that my actions seek what
   is right for all people and all children, and your daughters and your sons
[Gross hypocrisy by Obama  who is currently the world’s number 1
pathological liar, serial invader, warmonger, war criminal, child killer,
climate criminal,  and drug pusher. It is notable that Obama did not
mention illicit drugs in his speech. Also utterly ignored by Neocon
American and Zionist  Imperialist (NAZI)-perverted and subverted Western
Mainstream media are the 1.2 million people who have died world-wide since
9-11 due to US Alliance restoration of the Taliban-destroyed Afghan opium
industry from 6% of world market share in 2001 to 93% in 2007, the
breakdown (as of 2015)  including 280,000 Americans, 256,000 Indonesians,
68,000 Iranians, 25,000 British, 14,000 Canadians, 10,000 Germans, and
5,000 Australians [12]].
   1. This is what I believe:  that all of us can be co-workers with God.
   And our leadership, and our governments, and this United Nations should
   reflect this irreducible truth.
[This is what Obama blasphemously calls being “co-workers with God”: the
atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased to 405 ppm CO2 and is
increasing at a record 3 ppm CO2 per year; a catastrophic plus 2C
temperature rise is now unavoidable and the current plus 1C is already
catastrophic for tropical Island States and megadelta countries like
Bangladesh;  the plus 1.5C target may well be exceeded by 2020; the
coal-to-gas conversion by the US under Obama locks in disastrous long-term
greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution; 17 million people die avoidably each year;
7 million die from air pollution each year; the US Alliance has invaded 20
overwhelmingly or significantly Muslim countries since  the US Government’s
9-11 false flag atrocity, this being associated with 32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or hegemony-imposed
deprivation (27 million) [2, 4, 9, 67]. Of course the bottom line in any
human society  is respect for children but Obama has an appalling record
 of child killing. During the Vietnam War, decent people chanted “Hey, hey,
USA, how many kids did you kill today?” In May 2009  I catalogued  the
answer for America under Obama as 1,000 [68]].
   1. Thank you very much.  (Applause)
[Genuine gratitude one supposes by Obama who is currently the world’s
number 1 pathological liar, serial invader, warmonger, war criminal, child
killer, climate criminal,  and drug pusher but is free to operate as the
world’s current number 1 serial killer for another 3 months. Obama is
lauded as America’s first Black president but is complicit in the Muslim
Holocaust and Muslim Genocide that has taken 32 million non-European Muslim
lives  since the US Government’s 9-11 false-flag atrocity killed 3,000
people in 2001].
*Conclusions. *
Serial war criminal Barack Obama must be arraigned before the International
Criminal Court.  There  must be Boycotts, Divestment and Sanction (BDS)
against the United States and its war criminal allies until their  crimes
are recognized and punished and America and its allies undergo
 de-Nazification. The relatives, friends and fellow citizens of the 1.7
million Americans who die preventably each year must disempower the Neocon
American and Zionist  Imperialists (NAZIs) who have subverted and perverted
America and crippled America with the $40 trillion long-term accrual cost
of nuclear terrorist Apartheid Israel and attendant wars.
In 2005 Literature Nobel Laureate,  anti-racist Jewish British playwright
Harold Pinter declared that  Bush and Blair should be arraigned before the
International Criminal Court: “We have brought torture, cluster bombs,
depleted uranium, innumerable acts of random murder, misery, degradation
and death to the Iraqi people and call it “bringing freedom and democracy
to the Middle East”. How many people do you have to kill before you qualify
to be described as a mass murderer and a war criminal? One hundred
thousand? More than enough, I would have thought” [69]. 32 million? More
than enough I would have thought.

CypherPunks ,  Cryptome *Mendacious War Criminal Obama’s Final Speech To The UN General Assembly*
by Dr Gideon Polya (*) — CounterCurrents — September 24, 2016
America’s mendacious, serial invader,  war criminal, climate criminal and
human rights-violating  President Barack Obama made his last speech to the
UN General Assembly on 20 September 2016, a speech characterized by massive
lying by omission that is far, far worse than lying by commission because
the latter can at least be  refuted and subject to public debate. As
revealed by Edward Snowden, America spies on everyone in America and the
world, but Obama managed to comprehensively ignore a veritable Herd of
Elephants in the Room as detailed in the following analysis of his last UN
speech. As Dr Paul Craig Roberts has stated: “Washington lies about
The transcript of President Obama’s final speech to the UN [1] is
reproduced  below with key matters he has ignored set out succinctly in
square brackets, together with appropriate detailed documentation.
*PRESIDENT OBAMA:  *
   1. Mr. President; Mr. Secretary General; fellow delegates; ladies and
   gentlemen:  As I address this hall as President for the final time, let me
   recount the progress that we’ve made these last eight years.
[The atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased to 405 ppm CO2 and is
increasing at a record 3 ppm CO2 per year; a catastrophic plus 2C
temperature rise is now unavoidable, plus 1.5C may occur by 2020,  and the
current plus 1C is already catastrophic for tropical Island States and
megadelta countries like Bangladesh [2];  the coal-to-gas conversion by the
US under Obama locks in disastrous long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution
[3]; 17 million people die avoidably from deprivation each year, about half
of them children [4]; 7 million die from air pollution each year [5, 6];
the US Alliance has invaded 20 overwhelmingly or significantly Muslim
countries since the US Government’s 9-11 false flag atrocity, this being
associated with 32 million Muslim deaths from violence (5 million) or from
war- or hegemony-imposed deprivation (27 million) [7, 8] ].
   1. From the depths of the greatest financial crisis of our time, we
   coordinated our response to avoid further catastrophe and return the global
   economy to growth.  We’ve taken away terrorist safe havens, strengthened
   the nonproliferation regime, resolved the Iranian nuclear issue through
   diplomacy.  We opened relations with Cuba, helped Colombia end Latin
   America’s longest war, and we welcome a democratically elected leader of
   Myanmar to this Assembly.  Our assistance is helping people feed
   themselves, care for the sick, power communities across Africa, and promote
   models of development rather than dependence.  And we have made
   international institutions like the World Bank and the International
   Monetary Fund more representative, while establishing a framework to
   protect our planet from the ravages of climate change.
[US-complicit military coups in Honduras, Ukraine and Egypt; US-complicit
parliamentary coup in Brazil; US Alliance military intervention in 20
countries this century associated with the active or passive killing of 32
million Muslims[4, 7, 9-12] ; after the Global Financial Crisis the US
rewarded the banker criminals whereas Iceland sent them all to jail; the US
Alliance devastated Libya, formerly the richest country in Africa, and
devastated secular Syria, converting half the population to refugees in a
country that was formerly the world’s leading country for per capita
hosting of refugees [9]; the US Alliance  created ISIS in Iraq [11] and
backed ISIS in Syria against  the secular Assad Government in the interests
of Apartheid Israel, US hegemony and a “Sunni gas pipeline” from Qatar to
the Mediterranean [13]; while Iran has no nuclear weapons and declares it
does not want them, US-backed Apartheid Israel has as many as 400 nuclear
weapons and acquired them with US assistance [14]].
   1. This is important work.  It has made a real difference in the lives
   of our people.  And it could not have happened had we not worked together.
   And yet, around the globe we are seeing the same forces of global
   integration that have made us interdependent also expose deep fault lines
   in the existing international order.
[Under the existing international order 17 million people die avoidably
from deprivation each year on Spaceship Earth with a Neocon American and
Zionist  Imperialist (NAZI)-beholden US Government  in charge of the flight
deck [4]; America with 4% of the world’s population consumes 25% of its
resources; the variously dissident BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India,
China and South Africa) have moved toward an alternative, radical
proposition derived from the American Declaration of Independence,
specifically  that “all men are created equal”].
   1. We see it in the headlines every day.  Around the world, refugees
   flow across borders in flight from brutal conflict.  Financial disruptions
   continue to weigh upon our workers and entire communities.  Across vast
   swaths of the Middle East, basic security, basic order has broken down.  We
   see too many governments muzzling journalists, and quashing dissent, and
   censoring the flow of information.  Terrorist networks use social media to
   prey upon the minds of our youth, endangering open societies and spurring
   anger against innocent immigrants and Muslims.  Powerful nations contest
   the constraints placed on them by international law.
[There are 65 million refugees in the world today, half being  Muslims
fleeing genocidal US Alliance wars in their countries [9]; the US and US
Alliance countries are exceptionalist, ignore international law and
currently invade some 20 impoverished and largely or substantially Muslim
countries at will [7, 9]; the Obama Administrations and their lackey US
Alliance countries  have been complicit in  “muzzling journalists, and
quashing dissent, and censoring the flow of information” as illustrated by
the conduct of US –backed regimes throughout the world, through  the
“manufacturing consent” by compliant US and US Alliance Mainstream media
[15-17], and, notoriously,  by the US in relation to remorselessly
pursuing  the world hero whistle-blowers Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden
and Julian Assange].
   1. This is the paradox that defines our world today.  A quarter century
   after the end of the Cold War, the world is by many measures less violent
   and more prosperous than ever before, and yet our societies are filled with
   uncertainty, and unease, and strife.  Despite enormous progress, as people
   lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions
   between nations become more quick to surface.
[People have lost trust in the mendacity of governments that is well
illustrated by the comprehensive mendacity of the Obama Administrations as
outlined here; the US Center for Public Integrity found that the Bush
Administration told 935 lies between 9-11 and the invasion of Iraq [18];
Pullitzer Prize-wining journalist Seymour Hersh dismissed Obama’s “official
story” of the extra-judicial killing of Osama bin-Laden as a  pack of lies
except for the killing [19] – Dr Paul Craig Roberts went one further and
stated that even the asserted killing of Osama bin-Laden was a lie [20];
numerous science, engineering, architecture, aviation, military and
intelligence experts reject the “lying Bush official version” of 9-11 [8]
but Obama  accepts it , strongly opposed release of documents revealing
Saudi complicity in 9-11, and is resolutely opposed to legislation allowing
the relatives of  9-11 victims to sue foreign governments over their loss;
lying and secrecy mean that Obama and the US Establishment are accessories
after the fact of the  9-11 atrocity].
   1. And so I believe that at this moment we all face a choice. We can
   choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and
   integration.  Or we can retreat into a world sharply divided, and
   ultimately in conflict, along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race
   and religion.
[The US has long rejected “age-old lines of nation” in relation to other
nations, and since 1776 has invaded over 70 nations [21]; with US troops on
the ground in Syria, the US presently has military bases in 75 nations
[23]; the US Alliance has been invading and devastating Muslim countries
since the US Government’s 9-11 false flag atrocity, this being associated
with 32 million Muslim deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or
hegemony-imposed deprivation (27 million) [7, 9]; the Neocon American and
Zionist  Imperialist (NAZI)-perverted and subverted US backs nuclear
terrorist, racist  Zionist (RZ)-run, genocidally racist,
democracy-by-genocide Apartheid Israel  that is obscenely based “along
age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion”;  the  long-term
accrual cost of US support for Apartheid Israel is at least $40 trillion
[24]; in one of his last acts as president, Obama announced a $38 billion
military package for serial war criminal Apartheid Israel over the next
decade [25]].
   1. I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward, and not
   backward.  I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open
   markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights and
   international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for
   human progress in this century.  I make this argument not based on theory
   or ideology, but on facts — facts that all too often, we forget in the
   immediacy of current events.
[The “open markets” espoused by Obama is theory and ideology;  Professor
Lord Nicholas Stern has described climate change inaction as the greatest
market failure in human history [26]; the presently dominant economic
ideology of neoliberalism means maximizing the freedom of the smart and
advantaged to exploit natural and human resources for private profit [27,
28], and has evidently failed, as evidenced by a continuing financial
crisis, a  worsening climate emergency (already catastrophic for some
countries) and a worsening climate genocide that will see 10 billion people
perishing this century if climate change is not requisitely addressed [29]].
   1. Here’s the most important fact:  The integration of our global
   economy has made life better for billions of men, women and children.  Over
   the last 25 years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been
   cut from nearly 40 percent of humanity to under 10 percent.  That’s
   unprecedented.  And it’s not an abstraction.  It means children have enough
   to eat; mothers don’t die in childbirth..
[According to World Hunger: “ The United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization estimates that about 795 million people of the 7.3 billion
people in the world, or one in nine, were suffering from chronic
undernourishment in 2014-2016. Almost all the hungry people, 780 million,
live in developing countries, representing 12.9 percent, or one in eight,
of the population of developing counties” [30], i.e. in 2014-2016 about 11%
of the world suffered chronic undernourishment. 17 million people  die
avoidably each year from deprivation in the Developing World minus China ,
about half being children [4]. According to the World Bank “According to
the most recent estimates, in 2012, 12.7 percent of the world’s population
lived at or below $1.90 a day. That’s down from 37 percent in 1990 and 44
percent in 1981. This means that, in 2012, 896 million people lived on less
than $1.90 a day, compared with 1.95 billion in 1990, and 1.99 billion in
1981 ” [31] ].
   1. Meanwhile, cracking the genetic code promises to cure diseases that
   have plagued us for centuries.  The Internet can deliver the entirety of
   human knowledge to a young girl in a remote village on a single hand-held
   device.  In medicine and in manufacturing, in education and communications,
   we’re experiencing a transformation of how human beings live on a scale
   that recalls the revolutions in agriculture and industry.  And as a result,
   a person born today is more likely to be healthy, to live longer, and to
   have access to opportunity than at any time in human history.
[Obama’s optimistic Eurocentric vision does not apply to the Third Word in
which 17 million people die avoidably from deprivation and
deprivation-exacerbated disease each year [4]; there is a worsening climate
genocide that will see 10 billion people perishing this century if climate
change is not requisitely addressed [29]].
   1. Moreover, the collapse of colonialism and communism has allowed more
   people than ever before to live with the freedom to choose their leaders.
   Despite the real and troubling areas where freedom appears in retreat, the
   fact remains that the number of democracies around the world has nearly
   doubled in the last 25 years.
[Obama as a serial war criminal and serial invader has an appalling record
of denying numerous nations “the freedom to choose their leaders” – under
Obama the US Alliance has invaded 20 overwhelmingly or significantly Muslim
countries since  the US Government’s 9-11 false flag atrocity, this ongoing
Muslim Holocaust and Muslim Genocide being associated with 32 million
Muslim deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or hegemony-imposed
deprivation (27 million) since the US Government’s 9-11 false-flag atrocity
in 2001 [7-9]; under Obama the US has backed the removal of
democratically-elected government in Honduras and the Ukraine and of a
democratically-elected president in Brazil; under Obama the US continues to
subvert every nation on earth; most democracies are faux democracies in
which Big Money has replaced Democracy with Plutocracy, Kleptocracy,
Murdochracy, Lobbyocracy, Corporatocracy and Dollarocracy in which Big
Money purchases people, politicians, parties, public perception of reality,
political power and thence more private profit – with much of this Big
Money coming from tax-avoiding US corporations].
   1. In remote corners of the world, citizens are demanding respect for
   the dignity of all people no matter their gender, or race, or religion, or
   disability, or sexual orientation, and those who deny others dignity are
   subject to public reproach.  An explosion of social media has given
   ordinary people more ways to express themselves, and has raised people’s
   expectations for those of us in power.  Indeed, our international order has
   been so successful that we take it as a given that great powers no longer
   fight world wars; that the end of the Cold War lifted the shadow of nuclear
   Armageddon; that the battlefields of Europe have been replaced by peaceful
   union; that China and India remain on a path of remarkable growth.
[The overwhelmingly dominant One Percenter-owned Mainstream media are still
deceiving the  people and “manufacturing consent” [15]; the nuclear threat
remains – the upper  estimates of stored  nuclear weapons  are as follows:
US (7,315), Russia (8,000), Apartheid Israel (400), France (300), UK (250),
China (250), Pakistan (120), India (100), and North Korea (less than 10)
[32]; under Obama the US backed a neo-Nazi coup in the Ukraine and has
escalated military  confrontation in Eastern Europe leading to serious
fears of a nuclear and terminal WW3 [33, 34]; the rapid economic growth  of
the populous countries China and India means that CO2 pollution is
increasing at a record 3 ppm CO2 per year, although the annual per capita
greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution in tonnes CO2-equivalent  per person per
year is 8.9 (world average), 41.0 (US), 7.4 (China) and 2.1 (India) [35,
   1. I say all this not to whitewash the challenges we face, or to suggest
   complacency.  Rather, I believe that we need to acknowledge these
   achievements in order to summon the confidence to carry this progress
   forward and to make sure that we do not abandon those very things that have
   delivered this progress.
[See point  Obama is whitewashing the nuclear, poverty and climate
change threats [32, 33] – indeed Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)
should be applied against the worst GHG polluting countries [35, 36] and
all countries that refuse to join the present 127  nations who support the
Nuclear Weapons Ban [34]].
   1. In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the
   existing path to global integration requires a course correction.  As too
   often, those trumpeting the benefits of globalization have ignored
   inequality within and among nations; have ignored the enduring appeal of
   ethnic and sectarian identities; have left international institutions
   ill-equipped, underfunded, under-resourced, in order to handle
   transnational challenges.
[Obama is egregiously guilty of such “ignoring” e.g. ignoring the   17
million people who die avoidably from deprivation each year, about half of
them children [4] and, within the US,  the over 27% of African Americans
who live in poverty [37]].
   1. And as these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions
   of the world have pressed forward both in the wealthiest countries and in
   the poorest:  Religious fundamentalism; the politics of ethnicity, or
   tribe, or sect; aggressive nationalism; a crude populism — sometimes from
   the far left, but more often from the far right — which seeks to restore
   what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination.
[Under serial invader and serial war criminal Obama an “exceptionalist” US
has continued   “aggressive nationalism” with the US Alliance invading  20
overwhelmingly or significantly Muslim countries since  the US Government’s
9-11 false flag atrocity, this being associated with 32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or hegemony-imposed
deprivation (27 million) [7, 8] ]; “religious fundamentalism; the politics
of ethnicity, or tribe, or sect; aggressive nationalism; a crude populism”
are exhibited by US-backed, nuclear terrorist, racist Zionist-run,
genocidally racist, democracy-by-genocide, neo-Nazi Apartheid Israel in its
ongoing Palestinian Genocide [10] and its powerful espousal  via the
Zionist Lobby of the ongoing Muslim Holocaust and Muslim Genocide [7-9, 11,
   1. We cannot dismiss these visions.  They are powerful.  They reflect
   dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens.  I do not believe those
   visions can deliver security or prosperity over the long term, but I do
   believe that these visions fail to recognize, at a very basic level, our
   common humanity.  Moreover, I believe that the acceleration of travel and
   technology and telecommunications — together with a global economy that
   depends on a global supply chain — makes it self-defeating ultimately for
   those who seek to reverse this progress.  Today, a nation ringed by walls
   would only imprison itself.
[“Dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens” – the “too many”  have an
awful lot to  be dissatisfied about both globally and domestically in the
US. Thus globally nearly 1 billion live in dire poverty and suffer chronic
malnourishment [30, 31] with 17 million dying  from deprivation annually,
about half being children [4], and the Muslim world subject to a Muslim
Holocaust and Muslim Genocide in which  there have been  32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or hegemony-imposed
deprivation (27 million) since the US Government’s 9-11 false-flag atrocity
in 2001 [7, 8]. Domestically, 1.7 million Americans die preventably each
year, this carnage being inescapably linked to the fiscal perversions of
the $40 trillion long-term accrual cost of Apartheid Israel to America [38]
and successive  Neocon American and Zionist Imperialist  (NAZI)-perverted
 Administrations  committing trillions of dollars to killing Muslims abroad
in the War on Terror (the War on Muslims) rather than keeping Americans
alive at home [39]. American incomes have flat-lined for decades of course,
as for African Americans under America’s  first black president, 27% live
in poverty, *African American wealth is about 5 times lower  than that of
 Whites, millions of African Americans are excluded from voting, African
Americans are 8 times more likely to murder and 6 times more likely to be
murdered than Whites, Educational Apartheid has meant return of Segregation
with a vengeance, and African Americans  and Hispanic Americans  have
 about half their “fair share” of representatives  in Congress and 5-6
times less Congressional  representation than  Jewish Americans (despite
being collectively about 10 times more population-wise) [37]].*
   1. So the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration.
   Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such
   integration are broadly shared, and that the disruptions — economic,
   political, and cultural — that are caused by integration are squarely
   addressed.  This is not the place for a detailed policy blueprint, but let
   me offer in broad strokes those areas where I believe we must do better
   together.
[“Global integration” means that manufacturing jobs go to where the wages
are lowest in a new version of slavery that ignores the fundamental human
right to a decent life. The British (a) abolished slavery in Britain when
rural  Enclosures generated the effective slavery of a minimum wage
industrial working class; (b) later replaced slavery in the British
colonies by minimally paid “indentured labour” (e.g. the “5-year slavery of
Indian indentured labour in Fiji that finally ceased in 1922 [40] ); and
(c) today exploit Third World labour by the effective slavery of “global
integration” ].
   1. It starts with making the global economy work better for all people
   and not just for those at the top.  While open markets, capitalism have
   raised standards of living around the globe, globalization combined with
   rapid progress and technology has also weakened the position of workers and
   their ability to secure a decent wage.  In advanced economies like my own,
   unions have been undermined, and many manufacturing jobs have disappeared.
   Often, those who benefit most from globalization have used their political
   power to further undermine the position of workers.
[In the US the average wage has flat-lined in real terms for decades  but
the One Percenter and Ten Percenter share of annual income has steadily
increased for decades, this phenomenon also obtaining  elsewhere in the
Anglosphere [41-43].
   1. In developing countries, labor organizations have often been
   suppressed, and the growth of the middle class has been held back by
   corruption and underinvestment.  Mercantilist policies pursued by
   governments with export-driven models threaten to undermine the consensus
   that underpins global trade.  And meanwhile, global capital is too often
   unaccountable — nearly $8 trillion stashed away in tax havens, a shadow
   banking system that grows beyond the reach of effective oversight.
[US corporations are massively involved in egregious global tax avoidance
which contributes to the inequity that in turn drives the Global Avoidable
Mortality  Holocaust in which 17 million people die avoidably from
deprivation every year [4]. By backing anti-democratic neofascist and
neoliberal regimes around the world, America, including the US under Obama,
 massively  contributes to suppression of labour organizations].
   1. A world in which one percent of humanity controls as much wealth as
   the other 99 percent will never be stable.  I understand that the gaps
   between rich and poor are not new, but just as the child in a slum today
   can see the skyscraper nearby, technology now allows any person with a
   smartphone to see how the most privileged among us live and the contrast
   between their own lives and others.  Expectations rise, then, faster than
   governments can deliver, and a pervasive sense of injustice undermine
   people’s faith in the system.
[But in harsh reality Obama is part of the One Percent,  represents the One
Percent politically  and is dedicated to the deceit, manipulation and
variously egregiously violent suppression of the 99%].
   1. So how do we fix this imbalance?  We cannot unwind integration any
   more than we can stuff technology back into a box.  Nor can we look to
   failed models of the past.  If we start resorting to trade wars, market
   distorting subsidies, beggar thy neighbor policies, an overreliance on
   natural resources instead of innovation — these approaches will make us
   poorer, collectively, and they are more like to lead to conflict.  And the
   stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the
   wasteland of North Korea shows that central, planned control of the economy
   is a dead end.
[Professor Thomas Piketty in his seminal book “Capital  in the Twenty-First
Century” argues that gross inequity damages democracy (Big Money buys
votes) and damages the economy (the poor cannot afford to buy the goods and
services they produce) . Piketty argues for wealth transparency and  a
global annual wealth tax of up to 10% [41, 42], noting that France has an
annual wealth tax of up to 1.5% and Islam has had an annual wealth tax of
2.5% (zakkat) for 1,400 years [43].   It is estimated that an annual
 global wealth tax of 4% could abolish the Global Avoidable Mortality
 Holocaust and prevent  17 million people from dying  avoidably from
deprivation every year  – an annual global wealth tax of about 4% would
yield US$16 trillion annually and enable raising all countries to annual
per capita incomes equivalent to the $6,000 per person per year of China
and Cuba, countries for which annual avoidable mortality is zero (0) [44].
One can well understand why One Percenter Obama ignores the wealth tax
option. As for North Korea, it has been subject to frightening military
hostility from the genocidally violent US for about 70 years, and US
bombing in 1950-1953 killed 28% of the population [45]].
   1. But I do believe there’s another path — one that fuels growth and
   innovation, and offers the clearest route to individual opportunity and
   national success.  It does not require succumbing to a soulless capitalism
   that benefits only the few, but rather recognizes that economies are more
   successful when we close the gap between rich and poor, and growth is
   broadly based. And that means respecting the rights of workers so they can
   organize into independent unions and earn a living wage.  It means
   investing in our people — their skills, their education, their capacity to
   take an idea and turn it into a business.  It means strengthening the
   safety net that protects our people from hardship and allows them to take
   more risks — to look for a new job, or start a new venture.
[Great rhetoric from a neoliberal, corporatist, One Percenter president
Obama  under whom 1.7 million Americans die preventably every year [39]].
   1. These are the policies that I’ve pursued here in the United States,
   and with clear results.  American businesses have created now 15 million
   new jobs.  After the recession, the top one percent of Americans were
   capturing more than 90 percent of income growth.  But today, that’s down to
   about half.  Last year, poverty in this country fell at the fastest rate in
   nearly 50 years.  And with further investment in infrastructure and early
   childhood education and basic research, I’m confident that such progress
   will continue.
[One Percenter Obama is boasting that the One Percenters “only” captured
45% of income growth after the recession].
   1. So just as I’ve pursued these measures here at home, so has the
   United States worked with many nations to curb the excesses of capitalism —
   not to punish wealth, but to prevent repeated crises that can destroy it.
   That’s why we’ve worked with other nations to create higher and clearer
   standards for banking and taxation — because a society that asks less of
   oligarchs than ordinary citizens will rot from within.  That’s why we’ve
   pushed for transparency and cooperation in rooting out corruption, and
   tracking illicit dollars, because markets create more jobs when they’re
   fueled by hard work, and not the capacity to extort a bribe.  That’s why
   we’ve worked to reach trade agreements that raise labor standards and raise
   environmental standards, as we’ve done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
   so that the benefits are more broadly shared.
[The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is supported by US corporations but
opposed by both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton because  it will export
American jobs to low wage countries. The TPP is opposed by thoughtful
pro-environment people in the Pacific Rim  because it will enable US
corporations to successfully sue governments for losses due to
pro-environment legislation and other  pro-environment actions].
   1. And just as we benefit by combating inequality within our countries,
   I believe advanced economies still need to do more to close the gap between
   rich and poor nations around the globe.  This is difficult politically.
   It’s difficult to spend on foreign assistance.  But I do not believe this
   is charity.  For the small fraction of what we spent at war in Iraq we
   could support institutions so that fragile states don’t collapse in the
   first place, and invest in emerging economies that become markets for our
   goods.  It’s not just the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do.
[For the serial war criminal US to stop  perverting, subverting,  invading
and devastating “fragile states” would be an obvious way of preventing them
from collapsing. Thus the US Alliance under Obama has been war criminally
 invading and devastating 20 substantially or significantly  Muslim
countries,  impoverished nations in which 32 million Muslims have died from
violence (5 million) or from hegemony- and war-imposed deprivation (27
million) since 2001 [4, 7, 9]. The US-led France, UK and US (FUKUS)
Coalition  devastated Libya (0.1 million dead, 1 million refugees).  Libya
was formerly  the richest country in Africa [4, 7, 9]].
   1. And that’s why we need to follow through on our efforts to combat
   climate change.  If we don’t act boldly, the bill that could come due will
   be mass migrations, and cities submerged and nations displaced, and food
   supplies decimated, and conflicts born of despair.  The Paris Agreement
   gives us a framework to act, but only if we scale up our ambition.  And
   there must be a sense of urgency about bringing the agreement into force,
   and helping poorer countries leapfrog destructive forms of energy.
[The atmospheric CO2 concentration is now 405 ppm CO2 and increasing at a
record 3 ppm CO2 per year; the species extinction rate is now 100-1,000
times greater than normal, this giving rise to the term Anthropocene to
 describe the present era and the speciescide and ecocide, leading to
omnicide and terracide – the killing of our  Living Planet;  coral reefs
are hugely important ocean ecosystems,  but they started bleaching
worldwide when the atmospheric CO2 reached 320 ppm CO2, are endangered at
the current 405 ppm CO2,  and are essentially doomed in a mere 15 years’
time at the 450 ppm CO2  predicted from the current increase at 3 ppm CO2
per year. The annual per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution in tonnes
CO2-equivalent  per person per year is 8.9 (world average), 41.0 (US), 7.4
(China) and 2.1 (India)  [35, 36]. Paris-recognized as catastrophic, a plus
2C temperature rise is now unavoidable and the present circa plus 1C is
already disastrous for tropical Island Nations and tropical mega-delta
countries like Bangladesh [1, 2]. Indeed the lower Paris “target” of no
more than plus 1.5C may be exceeded as early as 2020 [46]]. Under Obama the
US has embarked on a massive coal-to-gas transition that locks in dirty
energy for decades and due to systemic gas leakage, gas burning for power
 could be dirtier GHG-wise than coal burning [47-50].
   1. So, for the wealthiest countries, a Green Climate Fund should only be
   the beginning.  We need to invest in research and provide market incentives
   to develop new technologies, and then make these technologies accessible
   and affordable for poorer countries.  And only then can we continue lifting
   all people up from poverty without condemning our children to a planet
   beyond their capacity to repair.
[Not mentioned by Obama, we urgently need to stop burning carbon fuels,
deforestation, methanogenic livestock production and population growth now.
It is already too late to avoid massive damage.  “Condemning our children
to a planet beyond their capacity to repair” has effectively already
happened. Thus assuming a damage-related Carbon Price in US Dollars of
$200 per tonne CO2-equivalent  (as estimated by Dr Chris Hope of
 90-Nobel-Laureate University of Cambridge),  the World has n inescapable
Carbon Debt of $360 trillion that is increasing at $13 trillion per year,
and, for example,  US lackey, climate criminal Australia, a world-leader in
annual per capita greenhouse (GHG) gas pollution,  has a Carbon Debt of
$7.5 trillion that is increasing at $400 billion per year and at $40,000
per head per year for under-30 year old Australians. Young people will
inescapably have to pay this huge and increasing Carbon Debt – thus unless
gigantic 20 meter sea walls are built, coastal cities will drown [47].
Young people  must wise up and demand urgent climate action [51-55] and
indeed a Climate Revolution now! [55]].
   1. So we need new models for the global marketplace, models that are
   inclusive and sustainable.  And in the same way, we need models of
   governance that are inclusive and accountable to ordinary people.
[ What gross deception and hypocrisy by Obama. American policy (“model of
governance”) has always been “might is right” when it comes to exploitable
resources. To that end, the US has invaded 71 countries, has military bases
in 75 and subverts every country on earth.  Thus the Iraq War continued
under Obama and has now transmuted into an endless War on Terror due to the
US-provoked rise of ISIS in Iraq and US Alliance support for this barbarous
terrorist organization in Syria against the secular Assad regime. The US
allies Turkey, Qatar. Apartheid Israel and Saudi Arabia contributed
significantly  to the rise  ISIS in Syria, this being consonant with US
policy to remove the secular Assad regime. Alan Greenspan on the Right and
Noam Chomsky on the Left both say that the Iraq War was about oil. US
Establishment intimate Robert Kennedy Junior says that the Syrian War is in
essence about a “Sunni gas pipeline” from Qatar [13]].
   1. I recognize not every country in this hall is going to follow the
   same model of governance.  I do not think that America can — or should —
   impose our system of government on other countries.  But there appears to
   be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now.  And
   I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest.  I
   believe in a liberal political order — an order built not just through
   elections and representative government, but also through respect for human
   rights and civil society, and independent judiciaries and the rule of law.
[Further egregious hypocrisy. America has repeatedly imposed its “system of
government” on other countries [4, 13, 21]. America  has invaded 71
countries, has military  bases in 75 countries and indeed subverts all
countries in the world. Under war criminal Obama, the US Alliance has
invaded 20 countries  [4, 21-23].   US drone strikes, targeted with the
help of US lackey Australia, are presently  being conducted against Libya,
Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Indeed it seems
likely that world-leading US-Apartheid Israeli drone technology was
involved in the 9-11 attacks on the US itself  (the alternative to this
hypothesis in the lying Bush “official version” of 9-11, to whit  that
people learning to fly tiny, single-engined  aircraft  were able to land
huge  passenger jets at high speed on a dime) [8].  How the US  has
repeatedly “impose[d] our system of government on other countries” was
explained by former CIA operative Philip Agee in his book “CIA Diary.
Inside the Company” in relation  to the US invasion of the Dominican
Republic [4] – invade, and then ban,  imprison, torture, kill or   exile
all those you don’t like and then hold “democratic elections” [56]].
   1. I know that some countries, which now recognize the power of free
   markets, still reject the model of free societies.  And perhaps those of us
   who have been promoting democracy feel somewhat discouraged since the end
   of the Cold War, because we’ve learned that liberal democracy will not just
   wash across the globe in a single wave.  It turns out building accountable
   institutions is hard work — the work of generations.  The gains are often
   fragile.  Sometimes we take one step forward and then two steps back.  In
   countries held together by borders drawn by colonial powers, with ethnic
   enclaves and tribal divisions, politics and elections can sometimes appear
   to be a zero-sum game.  And so, given the difficulty in forging true
   democracy in the face of these pressures, it’s no surprise that some argue
   the future favors the strongman, a top-down model, rather than strong,
   democratic institutions.
[Obama’s “true democracy” in the West has degenerated into  Big
Money-controlled  Plutocracy, Kleptocracy, Murdochracy, Lobbyocracy,
Corporatocracy and Dollarocracy in which Big Money purchases people,
politicians, parties, public perception of reality, political power and
thence more private profit. Fundamentally, democracy is about practical
 expression of the will of the people and in 1-party Cuba the desire of the
people for good  governance, health, and education has been met – despite
decades of war criminal US sanctions, Cuba has excellent health services,
female literacy is high  and infant mortality is the same as in the US [4]].
   1. But I believe this thinking is wrong.  I believe the road of true
   democracy remains the better path.  I believe that in the 21st century,
   economies can only grow to a certain point until they need to open up —
   because entrepreneurs need to access information in order to invent; young
   people need a global education in order to thrive; independent media needs
   to check the abuses of power.  Without this evolution, ultimately
   expectations of people will not be met; suppression and stagnation will set
   in.  And history shows that strongmen are then left with two paths —
   permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies
   abroad, which can lead to war.
[War criminal Obama certainly knows about war – under war criminal Obama
the US Alliance has invaded 20 countries and civilized people dread the
prospect of a Hillary Clinton Administration in which she will set out to
prove that she is a “real man” by following and indeed exceeding Obama’s
murderous example].
   1. Now, I will admit, my belief that governments serve the individual,
   and not the other way around, is shaped by America’s story.  Our nation
   began with a promise of freedom that applied only to the few.  But because
   of our democratic Constitution, because of our Bill of Rights, because of
   our ideals, ordinary people were able to organize, and march, and protest,
   and ultimately, those ideals won out — opened doors for women and
   minorities and workers in ways that made our economy more productive and
   turned our diversity into a strength; that gave innovators the chance to
   transform every area of human endeavor; that made it possible for someone
   like me to be elected President of the United States.
[A blood-thirsty Simon Legree rather than a subservient Uncle Tom, One
Percenter Obama is the willing servant of the Neocon American and Zionist
Imperialist  (NAZI)-dominated One Percenter Establishment running America.
Indeed Obama is a classic example of the embodiment of the dominant
“Whiteness” culture of America.  For  African Americans under America’s
 first Black president, 27% live in poverty, *African American wealth is
about 5 times lower  than that of  Whites, millions of African Americans
are excluded from voting, African Americans are 8 times more likely to
murder and 6 times more likely to be murdered than Whites, Educational
Apartheid has meant return of Segregation with a vengeance, and African
Americans  and Hispanic Americans  have  about half their “fair share” of
representatives  in Congress and 5-6 times less Congressional
 representation than  Jewish Americans (despite being collectively about 10
times more populous) [37]].*
   1. So, yes, my views are shaped by the specific experiences of America,
   but I do not think this story is unique to America.  Look at the
   transformation that’s taken place in countries as different as Japan and
   Chile, Indonesia, Botswana.  The countries that have succeeded are ones in
   which people feel they have a stake.
[However Obama’s asserted support for one-person-one-vote  is contradicted
by his  fanatical  support for nuclear terrorist, racist Zionist-run,
genocidally racist, democracy-by-genocide, neo-Nazi Apartheid Israel that
denies 73% of its now 52% majority of Indigenous Palestinians the right to
vote for the government ruling them. Obama is a genocidal  racist,
anti-Arab anti-Semite  and pathological  liar in his support for Apartheid
Israel in its ongoing Palestinian Genocide [10]].
   1. In Europe, the progress of those countries in the former Soviet bloc
   that embraced democracy stand in clear contrast to those that did not.
   After all, the people of Ukraine did not take to the streets because of
   some plot imposed from abroad.  They took to the streets because their
   leadership was for sale and they had no recourse.  They demanded change
   because they saw life get better for people in the Baltics and in Poland,
   societies that were more liberal, and democratic, and open than their own.
[The neo-Nazi coup that overthrew the democratically elected government  in
the Ukraine was backed by the US].
   1. So those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out
   forcefully, because both the facts and history, I believe, are on our
   side.  That doesn’t mean democracies are without flaws.  It does mean that
   the cure for what ails our democracies is greater engagement by our
   citizens — not less.
[See point  – racist Obama supports Apartheid in Palestine   just as his
racist presidential predecessors supported Apartheid in South Africa [4]].
   1. Yes, in America, there is too much money in politics; too much
   entrenched partisanship; too little participation by citizens, in part
   because of a patchwork of laws that makes it harder to vote.  In Europe, a
   well-intentioned Brussels often became too isolated from the normal push
   and pull of national politics.  Too often, in capitals, decision-makers
   have forgotten that democracy needs to be driven by civic engagement from
   the bottom up, not governance by experts from the top down.  And so these
   are real problems, and as leaders of democratic governments make the case
   for democracy abroad, we better strive harder to set a better example at
   home.
[Under Barack “Simon Legree” Obama, millions of Black Americans are denied
the vote under anti-felony laws and according to Dr Michelle Alexander of
the NAACP, nearly 80% of adult male Black Americans in Chicago are denied
the right to vote [57, 58]].
   1. Moreover, every country will organize its government informed by
   centuries of history, and the circumstances of geography, and the deeply
   held beliefs of its people.  So I recognize a traditional society may value
   unity and cohesion more than a diverse country like my own, which was
   founded upon what, at the time, was a radical idea — the idea of the
   liberty of individual human beings endowed with certain God-given rights.
   But that does not mean that ordinary people in Asia, or Africa, or the
   Middle East somehow prefer arbitrary rule that denies them a voice in the
   decisions that can shape their lives.  I believe that spirit is universal.
   And if any of you doubt the universality of that desire, listen to the
   voices of young people everywhere who call out for freedom, and dignity,
   and the opportunity to control their own lives.
[Unfortunately,  that asserted “liberty of the individual” in the
ostensibly  marvellous 1776 American Declaration of Independence  in
reality was freedom to invade, conquer, devastate and ethnically cleanse
Indigenous American  lands – indeed the real  purpose of the American War
of Independence was not “no taxation without representation” or “personal
liberty” but freedom to exterminate Indigenous Indians that had some
protection from the British in the context of the 18th century Anglo-French
war. [4].  By 1844 the United States, founded on the dream of genocide,
 had legislated to remove all Indigenous Indians from East of the
Mississippi [4]].
   1. This leads me to the third thing we need to do:  We must reject any
   forms of fundamentalism, or racism, or a belief in ethnic superiority that
   makes our traditional identities irreconcilable with modernity.  Instead we
   need to embrace the tolerance that results from respect of all human beings.
[The ultimate expression of racism is war.  Under war criminal Obama, the
US Alliance has invaded 20 countries  [4, 21-23].   US drone strikes,
targetted with the help of  US lackey Australia, are presently  being
conducted against Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and
Pakistan. Obama is one of the worst warmonger and war-making presidents and
hence one of the worst racists in American history  [4]].
   1. It’s a truism that global integration has led to a collision of
   cultures; trade, migration, the Internet, all these things can challenge
   and unsettle our most cherished identities.  We see liberal societies
   express opposition when women choose to cover themselves.  We see protests
   responding to Western newspaper cartoons that caricature the Prophet
   Muhammad.  In a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia
   attempting to recover lost glory through force.  Asian powers debate
   competing claims of history.  And in Europe and the United States, you see
   people wrestle with concerns about immigration and changing demographics,
   and suggesting that somehow people who look different are corrupting the
   character of our countries.
[The people of Crimea overwhelmingly voted for linkage to Russia after the
US-backed neo-Nazi Coup in the Ukraine. Anti-Semite Obama backs the
genocidally  racist,  colonizer,  and  Apartheid rogue state of Israel in
its illegal occupation and ethnic  cleansing of Arab lands].
   1. Now, there’s no easy answer for resolving all these social forces,
   and we must respect the meaning that people draw from their own traditions
   — from their religion, from their ethnicity, from their sense of
   nationhood.  But I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to
   preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate
   another group. If our religion leads us to persecute those of another
   faith, if we jail or beat people who are gay, if our traditions lead us to
   prevent girls from going to school, if we discriminate on the basis of race
   or tribe or ethnicity, then the fragile bonds of civilization will fray.
   The world is too small, we are too packed together, for us to be able to
   resort to those old ways of thinking.
[Obama as a pluralist liberal simply doesn’t wash – he is a racist
 warmonger heading a US Alliance that is making war in 20 impoverished
countries [4, 7-13]].
   1. We see this mindset in too many parts of the Middle East.  There, so
   much of the collapse in order has been fueled because leaders sought
   legitimacy not because of policies or programs but by resorting to
   persecuting political opposition, or demonizing other religious sects, by
   narrowing the public space to the mosque, where in too many places
   perversions of a great faith were tolerated.  These forces built up for
   years, and are now at work helping to fuel both Syria’s tragic civil war
   and the mindless, medieval menace of ISIL.
[ISIL (ISIS) arose directly from the Iraqi Genocide under the Bush and
Obama Administration that involved destruction of a modern state, 2.7
million Iraqi deaths from violence (1.5 million) or from war-imposed
deprivation (1.2 million), and massive disempowerment of the Iraqi Sunni
minority. The US created ISIS just as it created Al Qaeda and the Taliban.
ISIS in Syria has been enabled, funded and backed by US Alliance  members
 Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia in particular. Muslim-origin non-state
terrorism  is the greatest ally of US imperialism – every mindless atrocity
against Westerners is used as an excuse for vastly more deadly  US Alliance
attacks on Muslim populations in 20 countries from the Western Sahel to
South East Asia. ISIS and similar groups have enabled US or US Alliance
military domination over  a huge swathe of the Muslim world.
   1. The mindset of sectarianism, and extremism, and blood-letting, and
   retribution that has been taking place will not be quickly reversed.  And
   if we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able
   to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to co-exist
   for long.  But I do believe we have to be honest about the nature of these
   conflicts, and our international community must continue to work with those
   who seek to build rather than to destroy.
[ America under anti-Arab anti-Semitic warmonger Obama has devastated a
swathe of Muslim countries [4, 7-13]].
   1. And there is a military component to that.  It means being united and
   relentless in destroying networks like ISIL, which show no respect for
   human life.  But it also means that in a place like Syria, where there’s no
   ultimate military victory to be won, we’re going to have to pursue the hard
   work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence, and deliver aid to those
   in need, and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see
   those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.
[How disingenuous of  Obama to say “and there is a military  component to
that” in relation to his false assertion that the US and its allies “seek
to build rather than to destroy”. Obama seeks to change the government of
Syria and its efforts have killed 0.5 million Syrians, generated 12 million
refugees, and devastated what was once a peaceful, tolerant , secular
society in which numerous ancient faiths and sects got along peacefully
with each other as described  in William Dalrymple’s superb book “From the
Holy Mountain” [59]].
   1. Across the region’s conflicts, we have to insist that all parties
   recognize a common humanity and that nations end proxy wars that fuel
   disorder.  Because until basic questions are answered about how communities
   co-exist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human
   beings will suffer — most of all in that region — but extremism will
   continue to be exported overseas.  And the world is too small for us to
   simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own
   societies.
[The worst extremism being “exported overseas” is US imperialism  and US
Alliance imperialism. The casus belli (excuse for war) is provided by
US-created or US-provoked Muslim-origin non-state terrorists such as the
barbarous ISIS whose outrageous conduct (beheadings, sex slaves, forced
conversions, religious fanaticism, and  religious intolerance) could not
have been better scripted by the CIA.  One is reminded of US-lead terrorist
groups in Ecuador who would bomb Catholic churches so that the socialists
would be blamed [56] and similar US-led Gladio atrocities in Europe that
were designed to be blamed on “communists” [60].   Numerous science,
engineering, architecture, medicine, aviation, military and intelligence
experts conclude that the US Government  was responsible for the singular
9-11 atrocity in which 3,000 people died  [8, 22, 61-63]). However
post-9-11 terror hysteria has been used to attack civil liberties in the US
and in the West in general. Reality:  53 American residents were  killed in
America by “terrorists” in the 14 years since 9/11 and the average  US
population in this period was about 304 million (UN Population Division
data). Accordingly, the “empirical annual probability of an American dying
in the US from terrorism” is 53/(14 years x 304 million) =  about 1 in 100
million per year. In contrast, 1.7million American die preventably each
year as the Neocon American and Zionist Imperialist  (NAZI)-subverted US
Government steadfastly looks the other way and scares the population with
saturation terror hysteria propaganda  [64]].
   1. And what is true in the Middle East is true for all of us.  Surely,
   religious traditions can be honored and upheld while teaching young people
   science and math, rather than intolerance. Surely, we can sustain our
   unique traditions while giving women their full and rightful role in the
   politics and economics of a nation.  Surely, we can rally our nations to
   solidarity while recognizing equal treatment for all communities — whether
   it’s a religious minority in Myanmar, or an ethnic minority in Burundi, or
   a racial minority right here in the United States.  And surely, Israelis
   and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and
   recognize the legitimacy of Israel, but Israel recognizes that it cannot
   permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land.  We all have to do better
   as leaders in tamping down, rather than encouraging, a notion of identity
   that leads us to diminish others.
[Zionist lackey, anti-Arab anti-Semitic, pro-Apartheid, genocidally racist,
serial war criminal  and pathological liar  Obama obscenely blames the
victim with “Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians
reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel”. The dishonest
political  fiction of a “2-state solution” is now impossible with the
Zionist colonizers having ethnically cleansed 90% of Palestine in an
ongoing Palestinian Genocide by a nuclear terrorist, racist Zionist run,
genocidally racist, democracy by genocide Apartheid Israel that prevents
73% of its now 52%  majority  Indigenous Palestinian population from voting
for the government  ruling it. The racist  Zionists are now considering
only 2 options –  (a) continued Apartheid with 73% of Occupied Palestinians
highly abusively confined to the  Gaza Concentration Camp  or  West Bank
ghettoes or (b) outright genocidal expulsion of all or most Indigenous
Palestinian from Palestine (presently, of 12 million Indigenous
Palestinians about 50% are already totally excluded on pain of death from
living in their own country). Obama is committed to Israeli Apartheid and
the ongoing Palestinian Genocide as the front-man for the Neocon American
and Zionist Imperialist (NAZI)-perverted and subverted  US political
Establishment [10]].
   1. And this leads me to the fourth and final thing we need to do, and
   that is sustain our commitment to international cooperation rooted in the
   rights and responsibilities of nations.
[Obama as a serial invader and serial war criminal tramples on “the rights
and responsibilities of nations”, the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, the Rights of the Child, The UN Genocide Convention, the
Geneva Convention …].
   1. As President of the United States, I know that for most of human
   history, power has not been unipolar.  The end of the Cold War may have led
   too many to forget this truth.  I’ve noticed as President that at times,
   both America’s adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems
   were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington — and
   perhaps too many in Washington believed that as well.  (Laughter.)  But I
   believe America has been a rare superpower in human history insofar as it
   has been willing to think beyond narrow self-interest; that while we’ve
   made our share of mistakes over these last 25 years — and I’ve acknowledged
   some — we have strived, sometimes at great sacrifice, to align better our
   actions with our ideals.  And as a consequence, I believe we have been a
   force for good.
[Utter falsehood by a mendacious Obama who turns history on its head and
 whitewashes decades of utterly evil American war crimes throughout the
world. Under Obama alone the US Alliance has invaded 20 countries in the
 ongoing Muslim Genocide in the 21st century associated with 30 million
Muslim refugees and 32 million Muslim deaths from violence (5 million) or
from hegemony- or war-imposed deprivation (27 million) since the US
Government’s 9-11 false –flag atrocity [7-9]].
   1. We have secured allies.  We’ve acted to protect the vulnerable.  We
   supported human rights and welcomed scrutiny of our own actions.  We’ve
   bound our power to international laws and institutions.  When we’ve made
   mistakes, we’ve tried to acknowledge them.  We have worked to roll back
   poverty and hunger and disease beyond our borders, not just within our
   borders.
[The US under Obama has backed military coups, been associated with
invasions of 20 countries, supported Apartheid and genocide in Palestine,
opposed nuclear disarmament, and grossly violated human rights  at home and
abroad. Under Obama the coal-to-gas conversion by the US under Obama locks
in disastrous long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution and hence climate
change inaction for decades [48, 49],   17 million people die avoidably
from deprivation each year, about half of them children [4], and 7 million
die from air pollution each year [5, 6]. The 3 key threats to humanity are
(a) nuclear weapons, (b) poverty and (c ) climate change but under Obama
(a) the US increased its nuclear threat, continued to back nuclear
terrorist Apartheid Israel and opposed the nuclear weapons ban advocated by
about 130 countries [14]; (b) the US supports poverty-entrenching
 dictatorships, and of about $40 billion in annual US economic plus
military  aid, about $10 billion is military aid (40% to Apartheid Israel)
 and most of the remainder is linked to destructive US military
intervention; and (c) the pro-gas US is one of the worlds worst countries
for  annual per capita GHG pollution in terms of tonnes CO2-equivalent per
person per year (41.0 for the US, 8.9 world average, China 7.4 and India
2.1) and for  “income weighted annual per capita GHG pollution (US 207,
China 5.2 and India 0.3) [35, 36]].
   1. I’m proud of that.  But I also know that we can’t do this alone.  And
   I believe that if we’re to meet the challenges of this century, we are all
   going to have to do more to build up international capacity.  We cannot
   escape the prospect of nuclear war unless we all commit to stopping the
   spread of nuclear weapons and pursuing a world without them.
[ While imposing deadly Sanctions on Iran (that has zero nuclear weapons
and  repeatedly states that it does not want nuclear weapons and wants a
nuclear weapons-free Middle East), the US (7,315 nuclear weapons) is
boosting its nuclear and conventional forces in Asia and Australia, opposes
a nuclear weapons ban,  and continues to pour billions of dollars of
military aid into the war criminal, genocidally racist, ethnic cleansing
and nuclear terrorist rogue state of Apartheid Israel that reportedly has
up to 400 nuclear weapons, this having been acquired with US collaboration.
.  The upper  estimates of stored  nuclear weapons  are as follows: US
(7,315), Russia (8,000), Apartheid Israel (400), France (300), UK (250),
China (250), Pakistan (120), India (100), and North Korea (less than 10)
[14, 34]].
   1. When Iran agrees to accept constraints on its nuclear program that
   enhances global security and enhances Iran’s ability to work with other
   nations.  On the other hand, when North Korea tests a bomb that endangers
   all of us.  And any country that breaks this basic bargain must face
   consequences.  And those nations with these weapons, like the United
   States, have a unique responsibility to pursue the path of reducing our
   stockpiles, and reaffirming basic norms like the commitment to never test
   them again.
[see  The US is a world leader in nuclear terrorism. Iran does not have
nuclear weapons. Obama does not mention Apartheid Israel’s 400 nuclear
weapons [14, 34]].
   1. We can’t combat a disease like Zika that recognizes no borders —
   mosquitos don’t respect walls — unless we make permanent the same urgency
   that we brought to bear against Ebola — by strengthening our own systems of
   public health, by investing in cures and rolling back the root causes of
   disease, and helping poorer countries develop a public health
   infrastructure.
[  The dominant neoliberal ideology  in the US has ensured that
pharmaceutical advance is geared to highly profitable medicines for “White
folks” who can afford to buy them  –  however, the Ebola scare illustrated
how quickly US Big Pharma and medical research can move when “White folks”
are threatened. The efficacy of tens of thousands of medicines have been
determined in exhaustive trials based on “White folks” but their efficacy
has not been determined, for example,  for genetically diverse populations
in Africa].
   1. We can only eliminate extreme poverty if the sustainable development
   goals that we have set are more than words on paper. Human ingenuity now
   gives us the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our children —
   including our girls — the education that is the foundation for opportunity
   in our world.  But we have to put our money where our mouths are.
*[In terms of net official development assistance as “a percentage of gross
national income in 2015”, Sweden ranks top among OECD countries with 1.4%
whereas the US ranks 20th at 0.17% [66]]. *
   1. And we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding —
   to replace the ravages of war with cooperation — if powerful nations like
   my own accept constraints.  Sometimes I’m criticized in my own country for
   professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions.
   But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action —
   not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core
   interests, but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term
   — enhances our security.  And I think that’s not just true for us.
[With breathtaking arrogance Obama is saying that some time in the distant
future the US  might give up “some freedom of action” but it is “not giving
up our ability  … [to] pursue our core interests” i.e. an exceptionalist
 US will continue to subvert, threaten, invade, and devastate other
countries that reached an historical high for America under Nobel Peace
Prize winner but serial invader and serial war criminal Obama].
   1. If Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it
   may be popular at home, it may fuel nationalist fervor for a time, but over
   time it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less
   secure.  In the South China Sea, a peaceful resolution of disputes offered
   by law will mean far greater stability than the militarization of a few
   rocks and reefs.
[Russia responded to the racist, anti-Russian neo-Nazi coup in Ukraine that
was engineered and backed by the North America-located US; the
re-incorporation of strategically vital Crimea into Russia was
overwhelmingly supported by the Crimean population. The South China Sea is
called such  because it is off the coast of South China and not off the
coast of the North America-located US;  under anti-Arab anti-Semitic and
Islamophobic warmonger Obama the  US Alliance headed by the North
America-located US invaded 20 impoverished and distant countries in
pursuance of the Zionist-backed US War on Muslims (War on Terror) that has
been associated with 30 million Muslim refugees and 32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from hegemony- or war-imposed
deprivation (27 million) since the US Government’s 9-11 false –flag
atrocity [7-9]].
   1. We are all stakeholders in this international system, and it calls
   upon all of us to invest in the success of institutions to which we
   belong.  And the good news is, is that many nations have shown what kind of
   progress is possible when we make those commitments.  Consider what we’ve
   accomplished here over the past few years.
[Obama is using weasel words “stakeholders in this international system”
and “invest in the success of institutions” – what the US under Obama
should have been doing was obeying international laws and conventions,
instead of grossly violating these international laws and conventions].
   1. Together, we mobilized some 50,000 additional troops for U.N.
   peacekeeping, making them nimble, better equipped, better prepared to deal
   with emergencies.  Together, we established an Open Government Partnership
   so that, increasingly, transparency empowers more and more people around
   the globe.  And together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to
   help refugees who are desperate for a home.
[“US peace-keeping” is an oxymoron as evidenced by the Zionist–backed US
War on Muslims (War on Terror, Muslim Holocaust, Muslim Genocide) that has
been associated with 30 million Muslim refugees and 32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from hegemony- or war-imposed
deprivation (27 million) since the US Government’s 9-11 false –flag
atrocity [7-9]].
   1. We should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have
   been made at this General Assembly gathering.  I’ll be discussing that more
   this afternoon.  But we have to follow through, even when the politics are
   hard.  Because in the eyes of innocent men and women and children who,
   through no fault of their own, have had to flee everything that they know,
   everything that they love, we have to have the empathy to see ourselves.
   We have to imagine what it would be like for our family, for our children,
   if the unspeakable happened to us.  And we should all understand that,
   ultimately, our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those
   in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to
   accommodating these refugees.
[ Syria was an oasis of peace and religious tolerance and hosted more
refugees per capita that any other country – and then the US and the US
Alliance intervened with bombing and supporting terrorists to remove the
secular Syrian Government, killing 0.5 million people, generating 12
million Syrian refugees, and destroying this ancient country [9]].
   1. There are a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing.
   But many nations — particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits
   of geography — that can do more to offer a hand, even if they also insist
   that refugees who come to our countries have to do more to adapt to the
   customs and conventions of the communities that are now providing them a
   home.
[More breathtaking Obama dishonesty and implicit racism and bigotry; see
 – in terms of net official development assistance as “a percentage of
gross national income in 2015”, Sweden ranks top among OECD countries with
1.4% whereas the US ranks 20th at 0.17% [66]].
   1. Let me conclude by saying that I recognize history tells a different
   story than the one that I’ve talked about here today.  There’s a much
   darker and more cynical view of history that we can adopt.  Human beings
   are too often motivated by greed and by power.  Big countries for most of
   history have pushed smaller ones around.  Tribes and ethnic groups and
   nation states have very often found it most convenient to define themselves
   by what they hate and not just those ideas that bind them together.
[Obama actually tells the truth for once in admitting  his gross mendacity
and saying that “I recognize history tells a different story than the one
that I’ve talked about here today” [4]].
   1. Time and again, human beings have believed that they finally arrived
   at a period of enlightenment only to repeat, then, cycles of conflict and
   suffering.  Perhaps that’s our fate.  We have to remember that the choices
   of individual human beings led to repeated world war.  But we also have to
   remember that the choices of individual human beings created a United
   Nations, so that a war like that would never happen again.  Each of us as
   leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst
   impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best.  For we have shown that
   we can choose a better history.
[The UN was created to prevent  wars like WW2 that was associated with
violent deaths and avoidable deaths from deprivation totalling over 100
million. However US exceptionalism has meant that post-1950 US Asian wars
 have been associated with 40 million Asian deaths from violence or
war-imposed deprivation;1950-2005 avoidable deaths from deprivation in
countries occupied by the US in the post-1945 era have totalled 82 million
[4]; Muslim deaths from violence or imposed deprivation have totalled 32
million since 9-11, with Obama being directly involved in much of this
carnage; there are presently 65 million refugees in the world  of whom 30
million are Muslim refugees generated by a   genocidally  racist US or by
US-backed and genocidally racist Apartheid Israel [9]].
   1. Sitting in a prison cell, a young Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote that,
   “Human progress never rolls on the wheels of inevitability; it comes
   through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God.”
   And during the course of these eight years, as I’ve traveled to many of
   your nations, I have seen that spirit in our young people, who are more
   educated and more tolerant, and more inclusive and more diverse, and more
   creative than our generation; who are more empathetic and compassionate
   towards their fellow human beings than previous generations.  And, yes,
   some of that comes with the idealism of youth.  But it also comes with
   young people’s access to information about other peoples and places — an
   understanding unique in human history that their future is bound with the
   fates of other human beings on the other side of the world.
[Mass murderer, serial invader, serial war criminal and genocidal racist
Obama and his similarly  degenerate and   Zionist-perverted allies can
hardly be called “co-workers with God”].
   1. I think of the thousands of health care workers from around the world
   who volunteered to fight Ebola.  I remember the young entrepreneurs I met
   who are now starting new businesses in Cuba, the parliamentarians who used
   to be just a few years ago political prisoners in Myanmar.  I think of the
   girls who have braved taunts or violence just to go to school in
   Afghanistan, and the university students who started programs online to
   reject the extremism of organizations like ISIL.  I draw strength from the
   young Americans — entrepreneurs, activists, soldiers, new citizens — who
   are remaking our nation once again, who are unconstrained by old habits and
   old conventions, and unencumbered by what is, but are instead ready to
   seize what ought to be.
[How disgusting  that racist mass murderer Obama links himself to
courageous young humanitarians].
   1. My own family is a made up of the flesh and blood and traditions and
   cultures and faiths from a lot of different parts of the world — just as
   America has been built by immigrants from every shore.  And in my own life,
   in this country, and as President, I have learned that our identities do
   not have to be defined by putting someone else down, but can be enhanced by
   lifting somebody else up.  They don’t have to be defined in opposition to
   others, but rather by a belief in liberty and equality and justice and
   fairness.
[When truthful history is written, Obama will be defined by his
participation in the post-9-11 Muslim Holocaust and Muslim Genocide
associated with 30 million Muslim refugees and 32 million Muslim deaths
from violence – or from war - and hegemony-imposed deprivation [9]].
   1. And the embrace of these principles as universal doesn’t weaken my
   particular pride, my particular love for America — it strengthens it.  My
   belief that these ideals apply everywhere doesn’t lessen my commitment to
   help those who look like me, or pray as I do, or pledge allegiance to my
   flag.  But my faith in those principles does force me to expand my moral
   imagination and to recognize that I can best serve my own people, I can
   best look after my own daughters, by making sure that my actions seek what
   is right for all people and all children, and your daughters and your sons
[Gross hypocrisy by Obama  who is currently the world’s number 1
pathological liar, serial invader, warmonger, war criminal, child killer,
climate criminal,  and drug pusher. It is notable that Obama did not
mention illicit drugs in his speech. Also utterly ignored by Neocon
American and Zionist  Imperialist (NAZI)-perverted and subverted Western
Mainstream media are the 1.2 million people who have died world-wide since
9-11 due to US Alliance restoration of the Taliban-destroyed Afghan opium
industry from 6% of world market share in 2001 to 93% in 2007, the
breakdown (as of 2015)  including 280,000 Americans, 256,000 Indonesians,
68,000 Iranians, 25,000 British, 14,000 Canadians, 10,000 Germans, and
5,000 Australians [12]].
   1. This is what I believe:  that all of us can be co-workers with God.
   And our leadership, and our governments, and this United Nations should
   reflect this irreducible truth.
[This is what Obama blasphemously calls being “co-workers with God”: the
atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased to 405 ppm CO2 and is
increasing at a record 3 ppm CO2 per year; a catastrophic plus 2C
temperature rise is now unavoidable and the current plus 1C is already
catastrophic for tropical Island States and megadelta countries like
Bangladesh;  the plus 1.5C target may well be exceeded by 2020; the
coal-to-gas conversion by the US under Obama locks in disastrous long-term
greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution; 17 million people die avoidably each year;
7 million die from air pollution each year; the US Alliance has invaded 20
overwhelmingly or significantly Muslim countries since  the US Government’s
9-11 false flag atrocity, this being associated with 32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or hegemony-imposed
deprivation (27 million) [2, 4, 9, 67]. Of course the bottom line in any
human society  is respect for children but Obama has an appalling record
 of child killing. During the Vietnam War, decent people chanted “Hey, hey,
USA, how many kids did you kill today?” In May 2009  I catalogued  the
answer for America under Obama as 1,000 [68]].
   1. Thank you very much.  (Applause)
[Genuine gratitude one supposes by Obama who is currently the world’s
number 1 pathological liar, serial invader, warmonger, war criminal, child
killer, climate criminal,  and drug pusher but is free to operate as the
world’s current number 1 serial killer for another 3 months. Obama is
lauded as America’s first Black president but is complicit in the Muslim
Holocaust and Muslim Genocide that has taken 32 million non-European Muslim
lives  since the US Government’s 9-11 false-flag atrocity killed 3,000
people in 2001].
*Conclusions. *
Serial war criminal Barack Obama must be arraigned before the International
Criminal Court.  There  must be Boycotts, Divestment and Sanction (BDS)
against the United States and its war criminal allies until their  crimes
are recognized and punished and America and its allies undergo
 de-Nazification. The relatives, friends and fellow citizens of the 1.7
million Americans who die preventably each year must disempower the Neocon
American and Zionist  Imperialists (NAZIs) who have subverted and perverted
America and crippled America with the $40 trillion long-term accrual cost
of nuclear terrorist Apartheid Israel and attendant wars.
In 2005 Literature Nobel Laureate,  anti-racist Jewish British playwright
Harold Pinter declared that  Bush and Blair should be arraigned before the
International Criminal Court: “We have brought torture, cluster bombs,
depleted uranium, innumerable acts of random murder, misery, degradation
and death to the Iraqi people and call it “bringing freedom and democracy
to the Middle East”. How many people do you have to kill before you qualify
to be described as a mass murderer and a war criminal? One hundred
thousand? More than enough, I would have thought” [69]. 32 million? More
than enough I would have thought.

The Dawn of the Crypto Age
by CANNON C. , in the year 2015
- -An essay on how crypto technologies will shape our world, and why these
technologies are often met with government opposition-
 Throughout all of the chapters of history, civilization struggles in a
constant battle between liberty and tyranny, progression and corruption.
For the world is plentiful in numerous points of its history of a populace
oppressed by governments. Like a beast untamed or loosened, or a fire
fueled and spread, it is the natural tendencies of governments to become
corrupt and to perpetually expand and maintain power. This is not because
government in itself is corrupt, but rather because mankind is corrupt
through greed, in the pursuit of wealth and power at the expense of a
nation while utilizing the powerful body of government as their tool.
Government makes a handsome target of exploitation to the corrupt and
enemies of liberty due to the centralization of power that governments
wield and the position of the tool of government being in the high layer of
power, known as the political realm.
 Until now, the balance of power sat in the hands of governments who have
gone rogue at the conduction of usurpers and tyrants and have been used to
empower themselves while oppressing the populace and liberty, whether
openly or covertly. However, in the modern age, in this dawn of the crypto
revolution which follows the still advancing and parallel technological
revolution, the balance of power in the world is shifting from that of
governments and usurpers to the people.
 Throughout history, humankind has been through various golden ages of
enlightenment, and of technological advancements and progressions. It is
this evolution in the advancement of humankind which has altered the
foundation for which future technology and the direction of civilization is
based. We have had the Age of Enlightenment, the scientific revolution, the
Renaissance, the Industrial Revolution, and the technological/informational
revolution, to name a few. And now, even when the latter is still young, we
enter another age that parallels it: the dawn of the crypto revolution,
which is based upon the infrastructure of the current
technological/informational revolution.
 The context of the word "revolution" in the case of this writing refers to
that of sudden change in the world brought about by advancements in
technologies and discoveries, while "crypto" or "cryptographic" is
referring to the use of encryption (codes) paired with technology to create
systems immune to espionage, control, and takedown by an enemy.
 The newly emerging technology brought about by the crypto revolution is
built on our current technological infrastructure. The advent of our
current computerized cyber-infrastructure makes an easy way to build, host,
and deploy decentralized protocols. It is also cyberspace that connects us
all and breeds innovation through uncensored and decentralized
communications such as the Internet, hence why the crypto revolution began
shortly after the birth of the technological revolution. This new
technology will secure itself and also secure society from the current
flaws in our informational technology infrastructure which that same
society has come to rely upon.
 The crypto revolution will alter the shape of the workings of civilization
in positive ways to advance us towards a more perfect civilization, just as
the technological revolution altered the way we communicate, do business,
interact, etc. And just as how the industrial revolution altered the way we
travel, manufacture, and live, to too shall the crypto revolution shape our
world. This time, this era in human progression will impact the workings of
the economy, politics, banking, governments... all in a way that will make
the workings of the pre-crypto age antiquated and perhaps even scoffed at
by future generations.
 Just as the crypto revolution is based on the technological revolution
which was based on the industrial revolution, so too shall some other
future progressions be based on the crypto revolution. These future
progressions as a result of the crypto revolution I foresee being comprised
of political, economic, and social advancements.
 Although progressions in the advancement of civilization are often
beneficial to the human race, advancement is sometimes met with opposition
by the existing power structure. This opposition by the minority who wield
power over the rest is due to the threat this new technology/discovery
presents to their power. Opposition can also often be due to lack of
understanding of the new technology.
 The future of technology I am describing can be referred to as
decentralized cryptographic protocols - secure, open source, self
regulating, decentralized, cryptographic protocols, to be more descriptive.
For the new way will be a better way, a way void of the major flaws and
imperfection of the former which have empowered the corrupt and created
insecure systems causing results which have haunted our society. These
newly emerging technologies will repair the security flaws which came about
by having a society that became reliant upon informational technology. The
root of many of the current security flaws in our world come from the
exploitation of vulnerabilities that are a result of the lack of the
following three items, which I refer to together as the triangle of
Integrity, Availability, and Confidentiality

[UPDATE: September 2016: nearly two years after being written, this piece
has become a documentary of the same name: “*Diary of a Person of Interest*”
which is available for free on Vimeo.com  and
also on You Tube . Please

*Diary of a Person of Interest*
As for-profit, private sector, sub-contracted “Asset Tracking” (an
Orwellian term that masks it’s true meaning – Spying On You) and related
“investigatory” companies are being brought to light in the mainstream, it
seems useful to share some insight into a day in the life of a subject of
such unsavoury attention.
For no longer is the subject of state surveillance the traditional
‘criminal’ stereotype – but in fact regular people. The Persons of Interest
are anyone with any access to any kind of information that is of even the
vaguest interest to anyone with access to the apparently monolithic state
spying apparatus.
Add in two degrees of separation
 to the “Asset Tracking” –
ie., everyone the Person knows and everyone that *they* know for good
measure, and you have everyone from suburban mothers to doctors to
fishermen to airhostesses to school Principals getting followed around and
having their communications pried into by total strangers.
While it is indeed an issue of immoral and intrusive surveillance, there is
more to it.  Once targeted by the state, there is an all encompassing
psychological warfare as you are systematically conditioned to having the
most intimate parts of your life laid open to all and sundry, for them to
manipulate and, in some cases, profit from.
No act can be undertaken naturally – from the most banal decisions made in
the bathroom to any attempt to have a relationship with another person. The
more you are psychologically poked and prodded, the more you are forced to
sidestep entrapment efforts, the more exacerbated your mental isolation,
living in a world where the only person you can truly rely upon is yourself.
Decisions you make have complex and far-reaching consequences, not just for
yourself but for the numerous people who knowingly or unknowingly will be
affected by any choice you do make, and you live with the constant guilt of
the ways in which you are affecting other people’s lives without ever
intending to.
Some have described being the victim of such comprehensive intrusion and
manipulation as ‘torture’ and suggested it is an issue for the U.N. to
I don’t personally feel qualified to make such a claim because being inside
of it makes it impossible to have the level of detachment required to
reduce it to a single blanket statement.
However I do innately know that the following daily thought processes are
completely tragic and unnatural, and that humankind cannot continue like
Without further adieu: The Diary of a Person of Interest
4.30am – 6.30am: this is the worst time of the day. The entire
neighbourhood is asleep but your neighbour’s dogs bark incessantly and you
get to listen to the sounds of garage doors scraping and cars that
shouldn’t be going anywhere at that time going nonetheless. It pays to be
asleep between these hours.
7.30am:  Awake on the couch where you slept fully clothed so that there
wouldn’t be more footage of you walking around your house naked.  The
morning, which is structured around beautiful, happy and mostly oblivious
children, is the easiest time to forget that you have not enjoyed any
domestic privacy for nearly three years. The shrieks to get up, eat
breakfast and hurry off out the door are normal morning sounds and familiar
to the point of comfortable.
8.30am:  It  is time to go and you grab your keys, already looking at the
cul de sac for the car that will leave ahead of you, and then the other car
which will return behind you again after you have dropped the children at
school.  These cars, and many more, have been trailing you for years now
and were a source of great mystery prior to seeing the documentary ‘Operation
8 ‘ on NZ on Screen and
finally clicking as to what was taking place.  Funnily enough, back at the
beginning, when you were put in the hotseat via Skype to answer 10 fast
questions from a total stranger, one of them was whether you knew any of
the Urewera 4 .
You didn’t.  You had never been an activist or an organiser or an
independent journalist nor had any idea the surveillance state existed let
alone that you’d one day be targeted by it.  Now, after three years of its
unwelcome, immoral attentions, you not only know some of them but are
represented by their lawyer. In a funny way the persecution and oppression
heaped upon you drive you to the very places the state claims to not want
you to go, and results in the very friendships being established that they
ostensibly don’t want you to have.
9.30am:  one of your oldest and best friends in the world has messaged you
on Facebook. She misses you and wants to chat.  You’ve known her since you
were in your early teens and always had a heartfelt connection  to her. She
is one of the best people you know. But you are scared to respond to her
because her husband (who she married many years later) works for the US
military. Your very friendship, which you have cherished so much, is now a
potential danger to her and also to yourself. What will your activist and
media friends and colleagues think of you being friends with someone
connected to the military industrial complex? What will your friend and her
husband’s facebook friends think of them being connected to a new media
activist? Will they and everyone they know end up being spied on just
because you and she infrequently profess your love and gratitude for each
other’s existence? Is that grounds alone for equal intrusions upon her
life, the very fact of the connection? Will your government decide that you
must be a U.S.  plant because one of your best friends is American? Will
they trawl back through your completely innocuous past travels and decide
that there must be more to it than you doing your O.E.
?  The questions and
implications are endless, and all because she loves you and wants to say
10.30am: you are procrastinating now because you don’t want to do what you
should be doing. Crafting business plans for new ventures is no fun when
your intellectual property will be read and studied by your government and
perhaps others, long before you’ve even had a chance to submit it to the
rest of your team members. The complete absence of secure, private
communications has consistently led to your ideas and work being stolen for
the profit of others, and you are not eager to repeat the experience.
Building and creating something when others already have the blueprints is
a virtually impossible  endeavour. Any alliances you form or opportunities
you pursue will be interfered with, be it before during or after your
undertaking. Anything of value will be extracted and siphoned off and you
just don’t have the energy to try to convince others who are understandably
reluctant, of what is possible. While encryption offers some measure of
hope in terms of whittling down the number of people with the capacity to
penetrate the communications, the cold harsh reality of any hardware you
ever own being physically compromised plus the constant monitoring and
piggy-backing of all your digital work means that innovation can come only
in short bursts and in open source environments with an equal level playing
field. Peer to peer is no longer desirable when it is is peer to peer with
a man in the middle. Has to be all or nothing and you are relatively
content with little to nothing and thus accept the stifling of your full
11.30am:  As do many, you both relish and dread social media. As amazing a
tool for social change as it has been –  as responsible for many of your
successes as it has been – it’s true owners have been increasingly
asserting their control over it to the extent that nothing can be taken at
face value. Strange and beautiful messages intertwine and you are never
sure of the true source. Nasty, acerbic regurgitated commentary of your
daily struggles appears, alongside gloating or self-important, stuffy
rhetoric letting slip key intimacies gained from covertly obtained
knowledge of your physical environment and admonishing you. Occasionally,
there are outright death threats. The macabre and the vicarious combine and
the overall feeling is one of dirtiness, the slime of the negative energy.
There are fragments of light but fewer and so distant the sparkle is like a
mirage. When everything you see through a screen is malleable –
transferable, delayable, manipulable –  nothing can be certain, neither the
light nor the dark or whether they in fact come from the same source.
Messages sent are not necessarily messages received and as the manipulation
of your reality is total very little, if anything, can be taken for
granted; certainly not at face value.  Your entire online experience is
tailored and not just for advertising purposes. Your life defined by
algorithms that are constantly evolving, by means outside your reach and to
ends other than your own. Your every online second is now an opportunity to
be misconstrued, to be entrapped, to be monitored. The desire to exercise
the human right to communication is now a liability rather than a privilege.
12.30pm: You are hungry but you are just thinking about love again.
Day-dreaming. Pining.  Love moves you. This has long been determined and is
the pinnacle of your psychological profile.  The only thing they have found
that is guaranteed to make you act is love. For your thoughts are not
merely enough. The leeching of your ideas just a value-add to the targeting
of you. The real intention is to make you act. To trigger you, provoke you,
guide you in the direction they want you to go.  For they cannot prosecute
a thought – they cannot prosecute a speech. But they can prosecute an act.
Where they have forced others to act to their own detriment, the punishment
has been swift. Where they have not been able to, the ‘torture’ is
prolonged. The surveillance spans years. Way back at the beginning you
naievely thought all of this would end up on record. That it was being
collected for the purposes of a judge and a jury. As the months under
investigation became years, you finally realised – noone is going to give
this footage to a judge. Noone is going to film you in your bathroom and
then put that on a court record. The vast majority of the surveillance is
not collected on the behalf of a court, it is collected for the sole
benefit of the financier – whether that be a private funder or the state.
These countless intrusions are not for an investigation at all. They are
for a very specific set of reasons and it seems, may well now span the
entire remainder of your life. Your motivations, once gleaned, are
monopolised upon.  Your desires are pinpointed and then tantalisingly
dangled in front of you – the proverbial carrot. The deal with the devil is
to get what you want by giving him what he wants and then hoping he doesn’t
reneg on the bargain after the fact. It is a dangerous game, a slippery
slope. Your innocent dreams of love and companionship are the weakness by
which you are routinely attacked and there are seemingly no limits to what
can be done to influence and ultimately control your romantic situation.
For the watchers do not just watch – they insert themselves into your life
in as many capacities as possible, be it work or social, familial or via
acquaintances and friends of friends. They will hit on you in a bar; they
will befriend your friends under false pretences, for the sole motivation
of getting close enough to you to gain influence or insight. They are Rob
Gilchrist. They are Sabu. They will impersonate people you have known for
nearly a decade, and with great dedication and preparation, lull you into a
false sense of security so that you come to value a relationship which does
not exist.  Why? So that you will act, and so that they can capture that
act, and then wield it against you. Even if it is an act of love, an
intimacy, that exists only as a fruit of their deception and manipulation.
They falsely believe recording such acts empowers them. In fact, they are
holding the evidence of their own despicable natures and dastardly
undertakings, in their own hands. What they feel is their victory, in fact
exposes them, and not you. This is a valuable insight and you soon learn to
own the mistakes, the humiliations, while leaving the shame of them to the
perpetrators; the tarnish where it belongs.
1.30pm: Done with psychoanalysing and re-psychoanalyzing every potentiality
and its outcome, there is little more than an hour left to do anything
worthwhile.  Thus the mundane and safe becomes a warm and pleasant coccoon.
The actions for which you need not be concerned by hidden strings pulling,
manipulated by the hands of hidden puppetmasters. Dishes become a
pleasure.  Vaccuuming, a release. You dare not check the mail – you have
long since lost interest in it as it so often failed to arrive at all and
when it did, looked like mice had been eating the corners.  You try to have
everything redirected just so that you no longer have to be confronted with
the cold reality of the intrusions. Harder to escape the physical
intrusions. From the first burglary where nothing was stolen and your
bathroom window was smashed on the inside, to the little holes that appear
in your newly-refinished ceiling. The drill marks in the doorways. The
cracks in the top corners of mirrors, of photo-frames.  The worn lining in
the tops of the doors of your near-new car.  The underwear drawer full of
underwear torn to the hip. The precious watch from your grandmother; an
heirloom, smashed, with its face missing. The brand new 4-pack of socks on
top of your dresser that disappears while you are out, with only a dirty
pair of used men’s socks left in its place. The roof patch that is removed
as soon as the workmen replace it there. The car tyres that somehow
periodically get road spikes embedded in them.  The oil cap that
conveniently disappears into thin air. Yes, it is not just the
surveillance, it is the holistic sabotage, the psychological warfare, that
is the true burden of the Person of Interest.
3:00pm: Briefly life returns to the normal chaos of excitable children and
domestic routine.  Wondering what to have for dinner brings its own welcome
respite, as does visits and extra-curricular activities. You become
grateful for the most mundane mechanics of the suburban Matrix, which now
seem a luxury. Although you are well-aware you are already in a jail cell
and have been for years – albeit a more nicely appointed jail cell than the
traditional idea of one – any lapse in external interference is gratefully
received, with the relief of a dog that has ceased being whipped, even if
only momentarily.
5.30pm: You are long since accustomed to the strange, uncomfortable or
vacant looks of those who once held you in normal regard. Well aware that
part of the attack on your character and person is for others to spread
gossip and rumours, or approach those on the periphery and encourage them
to turn their scorn upon you for whatever reason, be it real or
manufactured. You are used to not being able to answer the most basic
questions; of never really knowing what does or doesn’t have hidden
meaning, or in what way you will be judged for your honesty. The most
perfunctory answers and social norms seem inherently dishonest. The urge,
the driving force to state things as they are under any cirumstance, always
balanced against perceived self-interest, out of sheer necessity. For if
you do not watch your own back, who will? Who better than you understands
what you are going through?
8.00pm: Thanks to immoral legislation and the ambivalence of the state
towards the individual privacies of Persons of Interest, strangers will
watch you read to your children tonight. Just as they watched you play the
piano, reviewed what songs you looked at on You Tube and scoffed as you
chased a mouse around the kitchen, trying to humanely catch it. Your family
time is undertaken in the manner of The Truman Show – centerpieces to the
analysis and amusement of others.  Those who fashion themselves Gods but
are not worthy of the title.  Once all is again quiet, you will relegate
yourself back to the couch and wonder to whom you can reach out – to whom
your silent pleas will be answered. By your friends? By your enemies? Or
are they one and the same? Too many times you have been made promises, too
many times you have made promises and been prevented from keeping them. The
great spiral of the unknown makes you aware that the tiny fragments you do
know and can hold on to are such insignificant pieces of the puzzle that
you are prevented from ever truly being the architect of your own destiny.
Instead you must rock, roll, tumble with the blows, take them as they come,
and find solitude and safety only in your dreams.

@_subject: Diary of a Person of Interest (Suzie Dawson @Suzi3d) 
[UPDATE: September 2016: nearly two years after being written, this piece
has become a documentary of the same name: “*Diary of a Person of Interest*”
which is available for free on Vimeo.com  and
also on You Tube . Please
watch it and share it! Documentary release notes are here at this pastebin
link . Thank you!]
*Diary of a Person of Interest*
As for-profit, private sector, sub-contracted “Asset Tracking” (an
Orwellian term that masks it’s true meaning – Spying On You) and related
“investigatory” companies are being brought to light in the mainstream, it
seems useful to share some insight into a day in the life of a subject of
such unsavoury attention.
For no longer is the subject of state surveillance the traditional
‘criminal’ stereotype – but in fact regular people. The Persons of Interest
are anyone with any access to any kind of information that is of even the
vaguest interest to anyone with access to the apparently monolithic state
spying apparatus.
Add in two degrees of separation
 to the “Asset Tracking” –
ie., everyone the Person knows and everyone that *they* know for good
measure, and you have everyone from suburban mothers to doctors to
fishermen to airhostesses to school Principals getting followed around and
having their communications pried into by total strangers.
While it is indeed an issue of immoral and intrusive surveillance, there is
more to it.  Once targeted by the state, there is an all encompassing
psychological warfare as you are systematically conditioned to having the
most intimate parts of your life laid open to all and sundry, for them to
manipulate and, in some cases, profit from.
No act can be undertaken naturally – from the most banal decisions made in
the bathroom to any attempt to have a relationship with another person. The
more you are psychologically poked and prodded, the more you are forced to
sidestep entrapment efforts, the more exacerbated your mental isolation,
living in a world where the only person you can truly rely upon is yourself.
Decisions you make have complex and far-reaching consequences, not just for
yourself but for the numerous people who knowingly or unknowingly will be
affected by any choice you do make, and you live with the constant guilt of
the ways in which you are affecting other people’s lives without ever
intending to.
Some have described being the victim of such comprehensive intrusion and
manipulation as ‘torture’ and suggested it is an issue for the U.N. to
I don’t personally feel qualified to make such a claim because being inside
of it makes it impossible to have the level of detachment required to
reduce it to a single blanket statement.
However I do innately know that the following daily thought processes are
completely tragic and unnatural, and that humankind cannot continue like
Without further adieu: The Diary of a Person of Interest
4.30am – 6.30am: this is the worst time of the day. The entire
neighbourhood is asleep but your neighbour’s dogs bark incessantly and you
get to listen to the sounds of garage doors scraping and cars that
shouldn’t be going anywhere at that time going nonetheless. It pays to be
asleep between these hours.
7.30am:  Awake on the couch where you slept fully clothed so that there
wouldn’t be more footage of you walking around your house naked.  The
morning, which is structured around beautiful, happy and mostly oblivious
children, is the easiest time to forget that you have not enjoyed any
domestic privacy for nearly three years. The shrieks to get up, eat
breakfast and hurry off out the door are normal morning sounds and familiar
to the point of comfortable.
8.30am:  It  is time to go and you grab your keys, already looking at the
cul de sac for the car that will leave ahead of you, and then the other car
which will return behind you again after you have dropped the children at
school.  These cars, and many more, have been trailing you for years now
and were a source of great mystery prior to seeing the documentary ‘Operation
8 ‘ on NZ on Screen and
finally clicking as to what was taking place.  Funnily enough, back at the
beginning, when you were put in the hotseat via Skype to answer 10 fast
questions from a total stranger, one of them was whether you knew any of
the Urewera 4 .
You didn’t.  You had never been an activist or an organiser or an
independent journalist nor had any idea the surveillance state existed let
alone that you’d one day be targeted by it.  Now, after three years of its
unwelcome, immoral attentions, you not only know some of them but are
represented by their lawyer. In a funny way the persecution and oppression
heaped upon you drive you to the very places the state claims to not want
you to go, and results in the very friendships being established that they
ostensibly don’t want you to have.
9.30am:  one of your oldest and best friends in the world has messaged you
on Facebook. She misses you and wants to chat.  You’ve known her since you
were in your early teens and always had a heartfelt connection  to her. She
is one of the best people you know. But you are scared to respond to her
because her husband (who she married many years later) works for the US
military. Your very friendship, which you have cherished so much, is now a
potential danger to her and also to yourself. What will your activist and
media friends and colleagues think of you being friends with someone
connected to the military industrial complex? What will your friend and her
husband’s facebook friends think of them being connected to a new media
activist? Will they and everyone they know end up being spied on just
because you and she infrequently profess your love and gratitude for each
other’s existence? Is that grounds alone for equal intrusions upon her
life, the very fact of the connection? Will your government decide that you
must be a U.S.  plant because one of your best friends is American? Will
they trawl back through your completely innocuous past travels and decide
that there must be more to it than you doing your O.E.
?  The questions and
implications are endless, and all because she loves you and wants to say
10.30am: you are procrastinating now because you don’t want to do what you
should be doing. Crafting business plans for new ventures is no fun when
your intellectual property will be read and studied by your government and
perhaps others, long before you’ve even had a chance to submit it to the
rest of your team members. The complete absence of secure, private
communications has consistently led to your ideas and work being stolen for
the profit of others, and you are not eager to repeat the experience.
Building and creating something when others already have the blueprints is
a virtually impossible  endeavour. Any alliances you form or opportunities
you pursue will be interfered with, be it before during or after your
undertaking. Anything of value will be extracted and siphoned off and you
just don’t have the energy to try to convince others who are understandably
reluctant, of what is possible. While encryption offers some measure of
hope in terms of whittling down the number of people with the capacity to
penetrate the communications, the cold harsh reality of any hardware you
ever own being physically compromised plus the constant monitoring and
piggy-backing of all your digital work means that innovation can come only
in short bursts and in open source environments with an equal level playing
field. Peer to peer is no longer desirable when it is is peer to peer with
a man in the middle. Has to be all or nothing and you are relatively
content with little to nothing and thus accept the stifling of your full
11.30am:  As do many, you both relish and dread social media. As amazing a
tool for social change as it has been –  as responsible for many of your
successes as it has been – it’s true owners have been increasingly
asserting their control over it to the extent that nothing can be taken at
face value. Strange and beautiful messages intertwine and you are never
sure of the true source. Nasty, acerbic regurgitated commentary of your
daily struggles appears, alongside gloating or self-important, stuffy
rhetoric letting slip key intimacies gained from covertly obtained
knowledge of your physical environment and admonishing you. Occasionally,
there are outright death threats. The macabre and the vicarious combine and
the overall feeling is one of dirtiness, the slime of the negative energy.
There are fragments of light but fewer and so distant the sparkle is like a
mirage. When everything you see through a screen is malleable –
transferable, delayable, manipulable –  nothing can be certain, neither the
light nor the dark or whether they in fact come from the same source.
Messages sent are not necessarily messages received and as the manipulation
of your reality is total very little, if anything, can be taken for

*Mendacious War Criminal Obama’s Final Speech To The UN General Assembly*
by Dr Gideon Polya (*) — CounterCurrents — September 24, 2016
America’s mendacious, serial invader,  war criminal, climate criminal and
human rights-violating  President Barack Obama made his last speech to the
UN General Assembly on 20 September 2016, a speech characterized by massive
lying by omission that is far, far worse than lying by commission because
the latter can at least be  refuted and subject to public debate. As
revealed by Edward Snowden, America spies on everyone in America and the
world, but Obama managed to comprehensively ignore a veritable Herd of
Elephants in the Room as detailed in the following analysis of his last UN
speech. As Dr Paul Craig Roberts has stated: “Washington lies about
The transcript of President Obama’s final speech to the UN [1] is
reproduced  below with key matters he has ignored set out succinctly in
square brackets, together with appropriate detailed documentation.
*PRESIDENT OBAMA:  *
   1. Mr. President; Mr. Secretary General; fellow delegates; ladies and
   gentlemen:  As I address this hall as President for the final time, let me
   recount the progress that we’ve made these last eight years.
[The atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased to 405 ppm CO2 and is
increasing at a record 3 ppm CO2 per year; a catastrophic plus 2C
temperature rise is now unavoidable, plus 1.5C may occur by 2020,  and the
current plus 1C is already catastrophic for tropical Island States and
megadelta countries like Bangladesh [2];  the coal-to-gas conversion by the
US under Obama locks in disastrous long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution
[3]; 17 million people die avoidably from deprivation each year, about half
of them children [4]; 7 million die from air pollution each year [5, 6];
the US Alliance has invaded 20 overwhelmingly or significantly Muslim
countries since the US Government’s 9-11 false flag atrocity, this being
associated with 32 million Muslim deaths from violence (5 million) or from
war- or hegemony-imposed deprivation (27 million) [7, 8] ].
   1. From the depths of the greatest financial crisis of our time, we
   coordinated our response to avoid further catastrophe and return the global
   economy to growth.  We’ve taken away terrorist safe havens, strengthened
   the nonproliferation regime, resolved the Iranian nuclear issue through
   diplomacy.  We opened relations with Cuba, helped Colombia end Latin
   America’s longest war, and we welcome a democratically elected leader of
   Myanmar to this Assembly.  Our assistance is helping people feed
   themselves, care for the sick, power communities across Africa, and promote
   models of development rather than dependence.  And we have made
   international institutions like the World Bank and the International
   Monetary Fund more representative, while establishing a framework to
   protect our planet from the ravages of climate change.
[US-complicit military coups in Honduras, Ukraine and Egypt; US-complicit
parliamentary coup in Brazil; US Alliance military intervention in 20
countries this century associated with the active or passive killing of 32
million Muslims[4, 7, 9-12] ; after the Global Financial Crisis the US
rewarded the banker criminals whereas Iceland sent them all to jail; the US
Alliance devastated Libya, formerly the richest country in Africa, and
devastated secular Syria, converting half the population to refugees in a
country that was formerly the world’s leading country for per capita
hosting of refugees [9]; the US Alliance  created ISIS in Iraq [11] and
backed ISIS in Syria against  the secular Assad Government in the interests
of Apartheid Israel, US hegemony and a “Sunni gas pipeline” from Qatar to
the Mediterranean [13]; while Iran has no nuclear weapons and declares it
does not want them, US-backed Apartheid Israel has as many as 400 nuclear
weapons and acquired them with US assistance [14]].
   1. This is important work.  It has made a real difference in the lives
   of our people.  And it could not have happened had we not worked together.
   And yet, around the globe we are seeing the same forces of global
   integration that have made us interdependent also expose deep fault lines
   in the existing international order.
[Under the existing international order 17 million people die avoidably
from deprivation each year on Spaceship Earth with a Neocon American and
Zionist  Imperialist (NAZI)-beholden US Government  in charge of the flight
deck [4]; America with 4% of the world’s population consumes 25% of its
resources; the variously dissident BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India,
China and South Africa) have moved toward an alternative, radical
proposition derived from the American Declaration of Independence,
specifically  that “all men are created equal”].
   1. We see it in the headlines every day.  Around the world, refugees
   flow across borders in flight from brutal conflict.  Financial disruptions
   continue to weigh upon our workers and entire communities.  Across vast
   swaths of the Middle East, basic security, basic order has broken down.  We
   see too many governments muzzling journalists, and quashing dissent, and
   censoring the flow of information.  Terrorist networks use social media to
   prey upon the minds of our youth, endangering open societies and spurring
   anger against innocent immigrants and Muslims.  Powerful nations contest
   the constraints placed on them by international law.
[There are 65 million refugees in the world today, half being  Muslims
fleeing genocidal US Alliance wars in their countries [9]; the US and US
Alliance countries are exceptionalist, ignore international law and
currently invade some 20 impoverished and largely or substantially Muslim
countries at will [7, 9]; the Obama Administrations and their lackey US
Alliance countries  have been complicit in  “muzzling journalists, and
quashing dissent, and censoring the flow of information” as illustrated by
the conduct of US –backed regimes throughout the world, through  the
“manufacturing consent” by compliant US and US Alliance Mainstream media
[15-17], and, notoriously,  by the US in relation to remorselessly
pursuing  the world hero whistle-blowers Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden
and Julian Assange].
   1. This is the paradox that defines our world today.  A quarter century
   after the end of the Cold War, the world is by many measures less violent
   and more prosperous than ever before, and yet our societies are filled with
   uncertainty, and unease, and strife.  Despite enormous progress, as people
   lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions
   between nations become more quick to surface.
[People have lost trust in the mendacity of governments that is well
illustrated by the comprehensive mendacity of the Obama Administrations as
outlined here; the US Center for Public Integrity found that the Bush
Administration told 935 lies between 9-11 and the invasion of Iraq [18];
Pullitzer Prize-wining journalist Seymour Hersh dismissed Obama’s “official
story” of the extra-judicial killing of Osama bin-Laden as a  pack of lies
except for the killing [19] – Dr Paul Craig Roberts went one further and
stated that even the asserted killing of Osama bin-Laden was a lie [20];
numerous science, engineering, architecture, aviation, military and
intelligence experts reject the “lying Bush official version” of 9-11 [8]
but Obama  accepts it , strongly opposed release of documents revealing
Saudi complicity in 9-11, and is resolutely opposed to legislation allowing
the relatives of  9-11 victims to sue foreign governments over their loss;
lying and secrecy mean that Obama and the US Establishment are accessories
after the fact of the  9-11 atrocity].
   1. And so I believe that at this moment we all face a choice. We can
   choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and
   integration.  Or we can retreat into a world sharply divided, and
   ultimately in conflict, along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race
   and religion.
[The US has long rejected “age-old lines of nation” in relation to other
nations, and since 1776 has invaded over 70 nations [21]; with US troops on
the ground in Syria, the US presently has military bases in 75 nations
[23]; the US Alliance has been invading and devastating Muslim countries
since the US Government’s 9-11 false flag atrocity, this being associated
with 32 million Muslim deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or
hegemony-imposed deprivation (27 million) [7, 9]; the Neocon American and
Zionist  Imperialist (NAZI)-perverted and subverted US backs nuclear
terrorist, racist  Zionist (RZ)-run, genocidally racist,
democracy-by-genocide Apartheid Israel  that is obscenely based “along
age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion”;  the  long-term
accrual cost of US support for Apartheid Israel is at least $40 trillion
[24]; in one of his last acts as president, Obama announced a $38 billion
military package for serial war criminal Apartheid Israel over the next
decade [25]].
   1. I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward, and not
   backward.  I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open
   markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights and
   international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for
   human progress in this century.  I make this argument not based on theory
   or ideology, but on facts — facts that all too often, we forget in the
   immediacy of current events.
[The “open markets” espoused by Obama is theory and ideology;  Professor
Lord Nicholas Stern has described climate change inaction as the greatest
market failure in human history [26]; the presently dominant economic
ideology of neoliberalism means maximizing the freedom of the smart and
advantaged to exploit natural and human resources for private profit [27,
28], and has evidently failed, as evidenced by a continuing financial
crisis, a  worsening climate emergency (already catastrophic for some
countries) and a worsening climate genocide that will see 10 billion people
perishing this century if climate change is not requisitely addressed [29]].
   1. Here’s the most important fact:  The integration of our global
   economy has made life better for billions of men, women and children.  Over
   the last 25 years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been
   cut from nearly 40 percent of humanity to under 10 percent.  That’s
   unprecedented.  And it’s not an abstraction.  It means children have enough
   to eat; mothers don’t die in childbirth..
[According to World Hunger: “ The United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization estimates that about 795 million people of the 7.3 billion
people in the world, or one in nine, were suffering from chronic
undernourishment in 2014-2016. Almost all the hungry people, 780 million,
live in developing countries, representing 12.9 percent, or one in eight,
of the population of developing counties” [30], i.e. in 2014-2016 about 11%
of the world suffered chronic undernourishment. 17 million people  die
avoidably each year from deprivation in the Developing World minus China ,
about half being children [4]. According to the World Bank “According to
the most recent estimates, in 2012, 12.7 percent of the world’s population
lived at or below $1.90 a day. That’s down from 37 percent in 1990 and 44
percent in 1981. This means that, in 2012, 896 million people lived on less
than $1.90 a day, compared with 1.95 billion in 1990, and 1.99 billion in
1981 ” [31] ].
   1. Meanwhile, cracking the genetic code promises to cure diseases that
   have plagued us for centuries.  The Internet can deliver the entirety of
   human knowledge to a young girl in a remote village on a single hand-held
   device.  In medicine and in manufacturing, in education and communications,
   we’re experiencing a transformation of how human beings live on a scale
   that recalls the revolutions in agriculture and industry.  And as a result,
   a person born today is more likely to be healthy, to live longer, and to
   have access to opportunity than at any time in human history.
[Obama’s optimistic Eurocentric vision does not apply to the Third Word in
which 17 million people die avoidably from deprivation and
deprivation-exacerbated disease each year [4]; there is a worsening climate
genocide that will see 10 billion people perishing this century if climate
change is not requisitely addressed [29]].
   1. Moreover, the collapse of colonialism and communism has allowed more
   people than ever before to live with the freedom to choose their leaders.
   Despite the real and troubling areas where freedom appears in retreat, the
   fact remains that the number of democracies around the world has nearly
   doubled in the last 25 years.
[Obama as a serial war criminal and serial invader has an appalling record
of denying numerous nations “the freedom to choose their leaders” – under
Obama the US Alliance has invaded 20 overwhelmingly or significantly Muslim
countries since  the US Government’s 9-11 false flag atrocity, this ongoing
Muslim Holocaust and Muslim Genocide being associated with 32 million
Muslim deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or hegemony-imposed
deprivation (27 million) since the US Government’s 9-11 false-flag atrocity
in 2001 [7-9]; under Obama the US has backed the removal of
democratically-elected government in Honduras and the Ukraine and of a
democratically-elected president in Brazil; under Obama the US continues to
subvert every nation on earth; most democracies are faux democracies in
which Big Money has replaced Democracy with Plutocracy, Kleptocracy,
Murdochracy, Lobbyocracy, Corporatocracy and Dollarocracy in which Big
Money purchases people, politicians, parties, public perception of reality,
political power and thence more private profit – with much of this Big
Money coming from tax-avoiding US corporations].
   1. In remote corners of the world, citizens are demanding respect for
   the dignity of all people no matter their gender, or race, or religion, or
   disability, or sexual orientation, and those who deny others dignity are
   subject to public reproach.  An explosion of social media has given
   ordinary people more ways to express themselves, and has raised people’s
   expectations for those of us in power.  Indeed, our international order has
   been so successful that we take it as a given that great powers no longer
   fight world wars; that the end of the Cold War lifted the shadow of nuclear
   Armageddon; that the battlefields of Europe have been replaced by peaceful
   union; that China and India remain on a path of remarkable growth.
[The overwhelmingly dominant One Percenter-owned Mainstream media are still
deceiving the  people and “manufacturing consent” [15]; the nuclear threat
remains – the upper  estimates of stored  nuclear weapons  are as follows:
US (7,315), Russia (8,000), Apartheid Israel (400), France (300), UK (250),
China (250), Pakistan (120), India (100), and North Korea (less than 10)
[32]; under Obama the US backed a neo-Nazi coup in the Ukraine and has
escalated military  confrontation in Eastern Europe leading to serious
fears of a nuclear and terminal WW3 [33, 34]; the rapid economic growth  of
the populous countries China and India means that CO2 pollution is
increasing at a record 3 ppm CO2 per year, although the annual per capita
greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution in tonnes CO2-equivalent  per person per
year is 8.9 (world average), 41.0 (US), 7.4 (China) and 2.1 (India) [35,
   1. I say all this not to whitewash the challenges we face, or to suggest
   complacency.  Rather, I believe that we need to acknowledge these
   achievements in order to summon the confidence to carry this progress
   forward and to make sure that we do not abandon those very things that have
   delivered this progress.
[See point  Obama is whitewashing the nuclear, poverty and climate
change threats [32, 33] – indeed Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)
should be applied against the worst GHG polluting countries [35, 36] and
all countries that refuse to join the present 127  nations who support the
Nuclear Weapons Ban [34]].
   1. In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the
   existing path to global integration requires a course correction.  As too
   often, those trumpeting the benefits of globalization have ignored
   inequality within and among nations; have ignored the enduring appeal of
   ethnic and sectarian identities; have left international institutions
   ill-equipped, underfunded, under-resourced, in order to handle
   transnational challenges.
[Obama is egregiously guilty of such “ignoring” e.g. ignoring the   17
million people who die avoidably from deprivation each year, about half of
them children [4] and, within the US,  the over 27% of African Americans
who live in poverty [37]].
   1. And as these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions
   of the world have pressed forward both in the wealthiest countries and in
   the poorest:  Religious fundamentalism; the politics of ethnicity, or
   tribe, or sect; aggressive nationalism; a crude populism — sometimes from
   the far left, but more often from the far right — which seeks to restore
   what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination.
[Under serial invader and serial war criminal Obama an “exceptionalist” US
has continued   “aggressive nationalism” with the US Alliance invading  20
overwhelmingly or significantly Muslim countries since  the US Government’s
9-11 false flag atrocity, this being associated with 32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or hegemony-imposed
deprivation (27 million) [7, 8] ]; “religious fundamentalism; the politics
of ethnicity, or tribe, or sect; aggressive nationalism; a crude populism”
are exhibited by US-backed, nuclear terrorist, racist Zionist-run,
genocidally racist, democracy-by-genocide, neo-Nazi Apartheid Israel in its
ongoing Palestinian Genocide [10] and its powerful espousal  via the
Zionist Lobby of the ongoing Muslim Holocaust and Muslim Genocide [7-9, 11,
   1. We cannot dismiss these visions.  They are powerful.  They reflect
   dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens.  I do not believe those
   visions can deliver security or prosperity over the long term, but I do
   believe that these visions fail to recognize, at a very basic level, our
   common humanity.  Moreover, I believe that the acceleration of travel and
   technology and telecommunications — together with a global economy that
   depends on a global supply chain — makes it self-defeating ultimately for
   those who seek to reverse this progress.  Today, a nation ringed by walls
   would only imprison itself.
[“Dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens” – the “too many”  have an
awful lot to  be dissatisfied about both globally and domestically in the
US. Thus globally nearly 1 billion live in dire poverty and suffer chronic
malnourishment [30, 31] with 17 million dying  from deprivation annually,
about half being children [4], and the Muslim world subject to a Muslim
Holocaust and Muslim Genocide in which  there have been  32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or hegemony-imposed
deprivation (27 million) since the US Government’s 9-11 false-flag atrocity
in 2001 [7, 8]. Domestically, 1.7 million Americans die preventably each
year, this carnage being inescapably linked to the fiscal perversions of
the $40 trillion long-term accrual cost of Apartheid Israel to America [38]
and successive  Neocon American and Zionist Imperialist  (NAZI)-perverted
 Administrations  committing trillions of dollars to killing Muslims abroad
in the War on Terror (the War on Muslims) rather than keeping Americans
alive at home [39]. American incomes have flat-lined for decades of course,
as for African Americans under America’s  first black president, 27% live
in poverty, *African American wealth is about 5 times lower  than that of
 Whites, millions of African Americans are excluded from voting, African
Americans are 8 times more likely to murder and 6 times more likely to be
murdered than Whites, Educational Apartheid has meant return of Segregation
with a vengeance, and African Americans  and Hispanic Americans  have
 about half their “fair share” of representatives  in Congress and 5-6
times less Congressional  representation than  Jewish Americans (despite
being collectively about 10 times more population-wise) [37]].*
   1. So the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration.
   Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such
   integration are broadly shared, and that the disruptions — economic,
   political, and cultural — that are caused by integration are squarely
   addressed.  This is not the place for a detailed policy blueprint, but let
   me offer in broad strokes those areas where I believe we must do better
   together.
[“Global integration” means that manufacturing jobs go to where the wages
are lowest in a new version of slavery that ignores the fundamental human
right to a decent life. The British (a) abolished slavery in Britain when
rural  Enclosures generated the effective slavery of a minimum wage
industrial working class; (b) later replaced slavery in the British
colonies by minimally paid “indentured labour” (e.g. the “5-year slavery of
Indian indentured labour in Fiji that finally ceased in 1922 [40] ); and
(c) today exploit Third World labour by the effective slavery of “global
integration” ].
   1. It starts with making the global economy work better for all people
   and not just for those at the top.  While open markets, capitalism have
   raised standards of living around the globe, globalization combined with
   rapid progress and technology has also weakened the position of workers and
   their ability to secure a decent wage.  In advanced economies like my own,
   unions have been undermined, and many manufacturing jobs have disappeared.
   Often, those who benefit most from globalization have used their political
   power to further undermine the position of workers.
[In the US the average wage has flat-lined in real terms for decades  but
the One Percenter and Ten Percenter share of annual income has steadily
increased for decades, this phenomenon also obtaining  elsewhere in the
Anglosphere [41-43].
   1. In developing countries, labor organizations have often been
   suppressed, and the growth of the middle class has been held back by
   corruption and underinvestment.  Mercantilist policies pursued by
   governments with export-driven models threaten to undermine the consensus
   that underpins global trade.  And meanwhile, global capital is too often
   unaccountable — nearly $8 trillion stashed away in tax havens, a shadow
   banking system that grows beyond the reach of effective oversight.
[US corporations are massively involved in egregious global tax avoidance
which contributes to the inequity that in turn drives the Global Avoidable
Mortality  Holocaust in which 17 million people die avoidably from
deprivation every year [4]. By backing anti-democratic neofascist and
neoliberal regimes around the world, America, including the US under Obama,
 massively  contributes to suppression of labour organizations].
   1. A world in which one percent of humanity controls as much wealth as
   the other 99 percent will never be stable.  I understand that the gaps
   between rich and poor are not new, but just as the child in a slum today
   can see the skyscraper nearby, technology now allows any person with a
   smartphone to see how the most privileged among us live and the contrast
   between their own lives and others.  Expectations rise, then, faster than
   governments can deliver, and a pervasive sense of injustice undermine
   people’s faith in the system.
[But in harsh reality Obama is part of the One Percent,  represents the One
Percent politically  and is dedicated to the deceit, manipulation and
variously egregiously violent suppression of the 99%].
   1. So how do we fix this imbalance?  We cannot unwind integration any
   more than we can stuff technology back into a box.  Nor can we look to
   failed models of the past.  If we start resorting to trade wars, market
   distorting subsidies, beggar thy neighbor policies, an overreliance on
   natural resources instead of innovation — these approaches will make us
   poorer, collectively, and they are more like to lead to conflict.  And the
   stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the
   wasteland of North Korea shows that central, planned control of the economy
   is a dead end.
[Professor Thomas Piketty in his seminal book “Capital  in the Twenty-First
Century” argues that gross inequity damages democracy (Big Money buys
votes) and damages the economy (the poor cannot afford to buy the goods and
services they produce) . Piketty argues for wealth transparency and  a
global annual wealth tax of up to 10% [41, 42], noting that France has an
annual wealth tax of up to 1.5% and Islam has had an annual wealth tax of
2.5% (zakkat) for 1,400 years [43].   It is estimated that an annual
 global wealth tax of 4% could abolish the Global Avoidable Mortality
 Holocaust and prevent  17 million people from dying  avoidably from
deprivation every year  – an annual global wealth tax of about 4% would
yield US$16 trillion annually and enable raising all countries to annual
per capita incomes equivalent to the $6,000 per person per year of China
and Cuba, countries for which annual avoidable mortality is zero (0) [44].
One can well understand why One Percenter Obama ignores the wealth tax
option. As for North Korea, it has been subject to frightening military
hostility from the genocidally violent US for about 70 years, and US
bombing in 1950-1953 killed 28% of the population [45]].
   1. But I do believe there’s another path — one that fuels growth and
   innovation, and offers the clearest route to individual opportunity and
   national success.  It does not require succumbing to a soulless capitalism
   that benefits only the few, but rather recognizes that economies are more
   successful when we close the gap between rich and poor, and growth is
   broadly based. And that means respecting the rights of workers so they can
   organize into independent unions and earn a living wage.  It means
   investing in our people — their skills, their education, their capacity to
   take an idea and turn it into a business.  It means strengthening the
   safety net that protects our people from hardship and allows them to take
   more risks — to look for a new job, or start a new venture.
[Great rhetoric from a neoliberal, corporatist, One Percenter president
Obama  under whom 1.7 million Americans die preventably every year [39]].
   1. These are the policies that I’ve pursued here in the United States,
   and with clear results.  American businesses have created now 15 million
   new jobs.  After the recession, the top one percent of Americans were
   capturing more than 90 percent of income growth.  But today, that’s down to
   about half.  Last year, poverty in this country fell at the fastest rate in
   nearly 50 years.  And with further investment in infrastructure and early
   childhood education and basic research, I’m confident that such progress
   will continue.
[One Percenter Obama is boasting that the One Percenters “only” captured
45% of income growth after the recession].
   1. So just as I’ve pursued these measures here at home, so has the
   United States worked with many nations to curb the excesses of capitalism —
   not to punish wealth, but to prevent repeated crises that can destroy it.
   That’s why we’ve worked with other nations to create higher and clearer
   standards for banking and taxation — because a society that asks less of
   oligarchs than ordinary citizens will rot from within.  That’s why we’ve
   pushed for transparency and cooperation in rooting out corruption, and
   tracking illicit dollars, because markets create more jobs when they’re
   fueled by hard work, and not the capacity to extort a bribe.  That’s why
   we’ve worked to reach trade agreements that raise labor standards and raise
   environmental standards, as we’ve done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
   so that the benefits are more broadly shared.
[The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is supported by US corporations but
opposed by both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton because  it will export
American jobs to low wage countries. The TPP is opposed by thoughtful
pro-environment people in the Pacific Rim  because it will enable US
corporations to successfully sue governments for losses due to
pro-environment legislation and other  pro-environment actions].
   1. And just as we benefit by combating inequality within our countries,
   I believe advanced economies still need to do more to close the gap between
   rich and poor nations around the globe.  This is difficult politically.
   It’s difficult to spend on foreign assistance.  But I do not believe this
   is charity.  For the small fraction of what we spent at war in Iraq we
   could support institutions so that fragile states don’t collapse in the
   first place, and invest in emerging economies that become markets for our
   goods.  It’s not just the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do.
[For the serial war criminal US to stop  perverting, subverting,  invading
and devastating “fragile states” would be an obvious way of preventing them
from collapsing. Thus the US Alliance under Obama has been war criminally
 invading and devastating 20 substantially or significantly  Muslim
countries,  impoverished nations in which 32 million Muslims have died from
violence (5 million) or from hegemony- and war-imposed deprivation (27
million) since 2001 [4, 7, 9]. The US-led France, UK and US (FUKUS)
Coalition  devastated Libya (0.1 million dead, 1 million refugees).  Libya
was formerly  the richest country in Africa [4, 7, 9]].
   1. And that’s why we need to follow through on our efforts to combat
   climate change.  If we don’t act boldly, the bill that could come due will
   be mass migrations, and cities submerged and nations displaced, and food
   supplies decimated, and conflicts born of despair.  The Paris Agreement
   gives us a framework to act, but only if we scale up our ambition.  And
   there must be a sense of urgency about bringing the agreement into force,
   and helping poorer countries leapfrog destructive forms of energy.
[The atmospheric CO2 concentration is now 405 ppm CO2 and increasing at a
record 3 ppm CO2 per year; the species extinction rate is now 100-1,000
times greater than normal, this giving rise to the term Anthropocene to
 describe the present era and the speciescide and ecocide, leading to
omnicide and terracide – the killing of our  Living Planet;  coral reefs
are hugely important ocean ecosystems,  but they started bleaching
worldwide when the atmospheric CO2 reached 320 ppm CO2, are endangered at
the current 405 ppm CO2,  and are essentially doomed in a mere 15 years’
time at the 450 ppm CO2  predicted from the current increase at 3 ppm CO2
per year. The annual per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution in tonnes
CO2-equivalent  per person per year is 8.9 (world average), 41.0 (US), 7.4
(China) and 2.1 (India)  [35, 36]. Paris-recognized as catastrophic, a plus
2C temperature rise is now unavoidable and the present circa plus 1C is
already disastrous for tropical Island Nations and tropical mega-delta
countries like Bangladesh [1, 2]. Indeed the lower Paris “target” of no
more than plus 1.5C may be exceeded as early as 2020 [46]]. Under Obama the
US has embarked on a massive coal-to-gas transition that locks in dirty
energy for decades and due to systemic gas leakage, gas burning for power
 could be dirtier GHG-wise than coal burning [47-50].
   1. So, for the wealthiest countries, a Green Climate Fund should only be
   the beginning.  We need to invest in research and provide market incentives
   to develop new technologies, and then make these technologies accessible
   and affordable for poorer countries.  And only then can we continue lifting
   all people up from poverty without condemning our children to a planet
   beyond their capacity to repair.
[Not mentioned by Obama, we urgently need to stop burning carbon fuels,
deforestation, methanogenic livestock production and population growth now.
It is already too late to avoid massive damage.  “Condemning our children
to a planet beyond their capacity to repair” has effectively already
happened. Thus assuming a damage-related Carbon Price in US Dollars of
$200 per tonne CO2-equivalent  (as estimated by Dr Chris Hope of
 90-Nobel-Laureate University of Cambridge),  the World has n inescapable
Carbon Debt of $360 trillion that is increasing at $13 trillion per year,
and, for example,  US lackey, climate criminal Australia, a world-leader in
annual per capita greenhouse (GHG) gas pollution,  has a Carbon Debt of
$7.5 trillion that is increasing at $400 billion per year and at $40,000
per head per year for under-30 year old Australians. Young people will
inescapably have to pay this huge and increasing Carbon Debt – thus unless
gigantic 20 meter sea walls are built, coastal cities will drown [47].
Young people  must wise up and demand urgent climate action [51-55] and
indeed a Climate Revolution now! [55]].
   1. So we need new models for the global marketplace, models that are
   inclusive and sustainable.  And in the same way, we need models of
   governance that are inclusive and accountable to ordinary people.
[ What gross deception and hypocrisy by Obama. American policy (“model of
governance”) has always been “might is right” when it comes to exploitable
resources. To that end, the US has invaded 71 countries, has military bases
in 75 and subverts every country on earth.  Thus the Iraq War continued
under Obama and has now transmuted into an endless War on Terror due to the
US-provoked rise of ISIS in Iraq and US Alliance support for this barbarous
terrorist organization in Syria against the secular Assad regime. The US
allies Turkey, Qatar. Apartheid Israel and Saudi Arabia contributed
significantly  to the rise  ISIS in Syria, this being consonant with US
policy to remove the secular Assad regime. Alan Greenspan on the Right and
Noam Chomsky on the Left both say that the Iraq War was about oil. US
Establishment intimate Robert Kennedy Junior says that the Syrian War is in
essence about a “Sunni gas pipeline” from Qatar [13]].
   1. I recognize not every country in this hall is going to follow the
   same model of governance.  I do not think that America can — or should —
   impose our system of government on other countries.  But there appears to
   be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now.  And
   I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest.  I
   believe in a liberal political order — an order built not just through
   elections and representative government, but also through respect for human
   rights and civil society, and independent judiciaries and the rule of law.
[Further egregious hypocrisy. America has repeatedly imposed its “system of
government” on other countries [4, 13, 21]. America  has invaded 71
countries, has military  bases in 75 countries and indeed subverts all
countries in the world. Under war criminal Obama, the US Alliance has
invaded 20 countries  [4, 21-23].   US drone strikes, targeted with the
help of US lackey Australia, are presently  being conducted against Libya,
Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Indeed it seems
likely that world-leading US-Apartheid Israeli drone technology was
involved in the 9-11 attacks on the US itself  (the alternative to this
hypothesis in the lying Bush “official version” of 9-11, to whit  that
people learning to fly tiny, single-engined  aircraft  were able to land
huge  passenger jets at high speed on a dime) [8].  How the US  has
repeatedly “impose[d] our system of government on other countries” was
explained by former CIA operative Philip Agee in his book “CIA Diary.
Inside the Company” in relation  to the US invasion of the Dominican
Republic [4] – invade, and then ban,  imprison, torture, kill or   exile
all those you don’t like and then hold “democratic elections” [56]].
   1. I know that some countries, which now recognize the power of free
   markets, still reject the model of free societies.  And perhaps those of us
   who have been promoting democracy feel somewhat discouraged since the end
   of the Cold War, because we’ve learned that liberal democracy will not just
   wash across the globe in a single wave.  It turns out building accountable
   institutions is hard work — the work of generations.  The gains are often
   fragile.  Sometimes we take one step forward and then two steps back.  In
   countries held together by borders drawn by colonial powers, with ethnic
   enclaves and tribal divisions, politics and elections can sometimes appear
   to be a zero-sum game.  And so, given the difficulty in forging true
   democracy in the face of these pressures, it’s no surprise that some argue
   the future favors the strongman, a top-down model, rather than strong,
   democratic institutions.
[Obama’s “true democracy” in the West has degenerated into  Big
Money-controlled  Plutocracy, Kleptocracy, Murdochracy, Lobbyocracy,
Corporatocracy and Dollarocracy in which Big Money purchases people,
politicians, parties, public perception of reality, political power and
thence more private profit. Fundamentally, democracy is about practical
 expression of the will of the people and in 1-party Cuba the desire of the
people for good  governance, health, and education has been met – despite
decades of war criminal US sanctions, Cuba has excellent health services,
female literacy is high  and infant mortality is the same as in the US [4]].
   1. But I believe this thinking is wrong.  I believe the road of true
   democracy remains the better path.  I believe that in the 21st century,
   economies can only grow to a certain point until they need to open up —
   because entrepreneurs need to access information in order to invent; young
   people need a global education in order to thrive; independent media needs
   to check the abuses of power.  Without this evolution, ultimately
   expectations of people will not be met; suppression and stagnation will set
   in.  And history shows that strongmen are then left with two paths —
   permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies
   abroad, which can lead to war.
[War criminal Obama certainly knows about war – under war criminal Obama
the US Alliance has invaded 20 countries and civilized people dread the
prospect of a Hillary Clinton Administration in which she will set out to
prove that she is a “real man” by following and indeed exceeding Obama’s
murderous example].
   1. Now, I will admit, my belief that governments serve the individual,
   and not the other way around, is shaped by America’s story.  Our nation
   began with a promise of freedom that applied only to the few.  But because
   of our democratic Constitution, because of our Bill of Rights, because of
   our ideals, ordinary people were able to organize, and march, and protest,
   and ultimately, those ideals won out — opened doors for women and
   minorities and workers in ways that made our economy more productive and
   turned our diversity into a strength; that gave innovators the chance to
   transform every area of human endeavor; that made it possible for someone
   like me to be elected President of the United States.
[A blood-thirsty Simon Legree rather than a subservient Uncle Tom, One
Percenter Obama is the willing servant of the Neocon American and Zionist
Imperialist  (NAZI)-dominated One Percenter Establishment running America.
Indeed Obama is a classic example of the embodiment of the dominant
“Whiteness” culture of America.  For  African Americans under America’s
 first Black president, 27% live in poverty, *African American wealth is
about 5 times lower  than that of  Whites, millions of African Americans
are excluded from voting, African Americans are 8 times more likely to
murder and 6 times more likely to be murdered than Whites, Educational
Apartheid has meant return of Segregation with a vengeance, and African
Americans  and Hispanic Americans  have  about half their “fair share” of
representatives  in Congress and 5-6 times less Congressional
 representation than  Jewish Americans (despite being collectively about 10
times more populous) [37]].*
   1. So, yes, my views are shaped by the specific experiences of America,
   but I do not think this story is unique to America.  Look at the
   transformation that’s taken place in countries as different as Japan and
   Chile, Indonesia, Botswana.  The countries that have succeeded are ones in
   which people feel they have a stake.
[However Obama’s asserted support for one-person-one-vote  is contradicted
by his  fanatical  support for nuclear terrorist, racist Zionist-run,
genocidally racist, democracy-by-genocide, neo-Nazi Apartheid Israel that
denies 73% of its now 52% majority of Indigenous Palestinians the right to
vote for the government ruling them. Obama is a genocidal  racist,
anti-Arab anti-Semite  and pathological  liar in his support for Apartheid
Israel in its ongoing Palestinian Genocide [10]].
   1. In Europe, the progress of those countries in the former Soviet bloc
   that embraced democracy stand in clear contrast to those that did not.
   After all, the people of Ukraine did not take to the streets because of
   some plot imposed from abroad.  They took to the streets because their
   leadership was for sale and they had no recourse.  They demanded change
   because they saw life get better for people in the Baltics and in Poland,
   societies that were more liberal, and democratic, and open than their own.
[The neo-Nazi coup that overthrew the democratically elected government  in
the Ukraine was backed by the US].
   1. So those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out
   forcefully, because both the facts and history, I believe, are on our
   side.  That doesn’t mean democracies are without flaws.  It does mean that
   the cure for what ails our democracies is greater engagement by our
   citizens — not less.
[See point  – racist Obama supports Apartheid in Palestine   just as his
racist presidential predecessors supported Apartheid in South Africa [4]].
   1. Yes, in America, there is too much money in politics; too much
   entrenched partisanship; too little participation by citizens, in part
   because of a patchwork of laws that makes it harder to vote.  In Europe, a
   well-intentioned Brussels often became too isolated from the normal push
   and pull of national politics.  Too often, in capitals, decision-makers
   have forgotten that democracy needs to be driven by civic engagement from
   the bottom up, not governance by experts from the top down.  And so these
   are real problems, and as leaders of democratic governments make the case
   for democracy abroad, we better strive harder to set a better example at
   home.
[Under Barack “Simon Legree” Obama, millions of Black Americans are denied
the vote under anti-felony laws and according to Dr Michelle Alexander of
the NAACP, nearly 80% of adult male Black Americans in Chicago are denied
the right to vote [57, 58]].
   1. Moreover, every country will organize its government informed by
   centuries of history, and the circumstances of geography, and the deeply
   held beliefs of its people.  So I recognize a traditional society may value
   unity and cohesion more than a diverse country like my own, which was
   founded upon what, at the time, was a radical idea — the idea of the
   liberty of individual human beings endowed with certain God-given rights.
   But that does not mean that ordinary people in Asia, or Africa, or the
   Middle East somehow prefer arbitrary rule that denies them a voice in the
   decisions that can shape their lives.  I believe that spirit is universal.
   And if any of you doubt the universality of that desire, listen to the
   voices of young people everywhere who call out for freedom, and dignity,
   and the opportunity to control their own lives.
[Unfortunately,  that asserted “liberty of the individual” in the
ostensibly  marvellous 1776 American Declaration of Independence  in
reality was freedom to invade, conquer, devastate and ethnically cleanse
Indigenous American  lands – indeed the real  purpose of the American War
of Independence was not “no taxation without representation” or “personal
liberty” but freedom to exterminate Indigenous Indians that had some
protection from the British in the context of the 18th century Anglo-French
war. [4].  By 1844 the United States, founded on the dream of genocide,
 had legislated to remove all Indigenous Indians from East of the
Mississippi [4]].
   1. This leads me to the third thing we need to do:  We must reject any
   forms of fundamentalism, or racism, or a belief in ethnic superiority that
   makes our traditional identities irreconcilable with modernity.  Instead we
   need to embrace the tolerance that results from respect of all human beings.
[The ultimate expression of racism is war.  Under war criminal Obama, the
US Alliance has invaded 20 countries  [4, 21-23].   US drone strikes,
targetted with the help of  US lackey Australia, are presently  being
conducted against Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and
Pakistan. Obama is one of the worst warmonger and war-making presidents and
hence one of the worst racists in American history  [4]].
   1. It’s a truism that global integration has led to a collision of
   cultures; trade, migration, the Internet, all these things can challenge
   and unsettle our most cherished identities.  We see liberal societies
   express opposition when women choose to cover themselves.  We see protests
   responding to Western newspaper cartoons that caricature the Prophet
   Muhammad.  In a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia
   attempting to recover lost glory through force.  Asian powers debate
   competing claims of history.  And in Europe and the United States, you see
   people wrestle with concerns about immigration and changing demographics,
   and suggesting that somehow people who look different are corrupting the
   character of our countries.
[The people of Crimea overwhelmingly voted for linkage to Russia after the
US-backed neo-Nazi Coup in the Ukraine. Anti-Semite Obama backs the
genocidally  racist,  colonizer,  and  Apartheid rogue state of Israel in
its illegal occupation and ethnic  cleansing of Arab lands].
   1. Now, there’s no easy answer for resolving all these social forces,
   and we must respect the meaning that people draw from their own traditions
   — from their religion, from their ethnicity, from their sense of
   nationhood.  But I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to
   preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate
   another group. If our religion leads us to persecute those of another
   faith, if we jail or beat people who are gay, if our traditions lead us to
   prevent girls from going to school, if we discriminate on the basis of race
   or tribe or ethnicity, then the fragile bonds of civilization will fray.
   The world is too small, we are too packed together, for us to be able to
   resort to those old ways of thinking.
[Obama as a pluralist liberal simply doesn’t wash – he is a racist
 warmonger heading a US Alliance that is making war in 20 impoverished
countries [4, 7-13]].
   1. We see this mindset in too many parts of the Middle East.  There, so
   much of the collapse in order has been fueled because leaders sought
   legitimacy not because of policies or programs but by resorting to
   persecuting political opposition, or demonizing other religious sects, by
   narrowing the public space to the mosque, where in too many places
   perversions of a great faith were tolerated.  These forces built up for
   years, and are now at work helping to fuel both Syria’s tragic civil war
   and the mindless, medieval menace of ISIL.
[ISIL (ISIS) arose directly from the Iraqi Genocide under the Bush and
Obama Administration that involved destruction of a modern state, 2.7
million Iraqi deaths from violence (1.5 million) or from war-imposed
deprivation (1.2 million), and massive disempowerment of the Iraqi Sunni
minority. The US created ISIS just as it created Al Qaeda and the Taliban.
ISIS in Syria has been enabled, funded and backed by US Alliance  members
 Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia in particular. Muslim-origin non-state
terrorism  is the greatest ally of US imperialism – every mindless atrocity
against Westerners is used as an excuse for vastly more deadly  US Alliance
attacks on Muslim populations in 20 countries from the Western Sahel to
South East Asia. ISIS and similar groups have enabled US or US Alliance
military domination over  a huge swathe of the Muslim world.
   1. The mindset of sectarianism, and extremism, and blood-letting, and
   retribution that has been taking place will not be quickly reversed.  And
   if we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able
   to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to co-exist
   for long.  But I do believe we have to be honest about the nature of these
   conflicts, and our international community must continue to work with those
   who seek to build rather than to destroy.
[ America under anti-Arab anti-Semitic warmonger Obama has devastated a
swathe of Muslim countries [4, 7-13]].
   1. And there is a military component to that.  It means being united and
   relentless in destroying networks like ISIL, which show no respect for
   human life.  But it also means that in a place like Syria, where there’s no
   ultimate military victory to be won, we’re going to have to pursue the hard
   work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence, and deliver aid to those
   in need, and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see
   those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.
[How disingenuous of  Obama to say “and there is a military  component to
that” in relation to his false assertion that the US and its allies “seek
to build rather than to destroy”. Obama seeks to change the government of
Syria and its efforts have killed 0.5 million Syrians, generated 12 million
refugees, and devastated what was once a peaceful, tolerant , secular
society in which numerous ancient faiths and sects got along peacefully
with each other as described  in William Dalrymple’s superb book “From the
Holy Mountain” [59]].
   1. Across the region’s conflicts, we have to insist that all parties
   recognize a common humanity and that nations end proxy wars that fuel
   disorder.  Because until basic questions are answered about how communities
   co-exist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human
   beings will suffer — most of all in that region — but extremism will
   continue to be exported overseas.  And the world is too small for us to
   simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own
   societies.
[The worst extremism being “exported overseas” is US imperialism  and US
Alliance imperialism. The casus belli (excuse for war) is provided by
US-created or US-provoked Muslim-origin non-state terrorists such as the
barbarous ISIS whose outrageous conduct (beheadings, sex slaves, forced
conversions, religious fanaticism, and  religious intolerance) could not
have been better scripted by the CIA.  One is reminded of US-lead terrorist
groups in Ecuador who would bomb Catholic churches so that the socialists
would be blamed [56] and similar US-led Gladio atrocities in Europe that
were designed to be blamed on “communists” [60].   Numerous science,
engineering, architecture, medicine, aviation, military and intelligence
experts conclude that the US Government  was responsible for the singular
9-11 atrocity in which 3,000 people died  [8, 22, 61-63]). However
post-9-11 terror hysteria has been used to attack civil liberties in the US
and in the West in general. Reality:  53 American residents were  killed in
America by “terrorists” in the 14 years since 9/11 and the average  US
population in this period was about 304 million (UN Population Division
data). Accordingly, the “empirical annual probability of an American dying
in the US from terrorism” is 53/(14 years x 304 million) =  about 1 in 100
million per year. In contrast, 1.7million American die preventably each
year as the Neocon American and Zionist Imperialist  (NAZI)-subverted US
Government steadfastly looks the other way and scares the population with
saturation terror hysteria propaganda  [64]].
   1. And what is true in the Middle East is true for all of us.  Surely,
   religious traditions can be honored and upheld while teaching young people
   science and math, rather than intolerance. Surely, we can sustain our
   unique traditions while giving women their full and rightful role in the
   politics and economics of a nation.  Surely, we can rally our nations to
   solidarity while recognizing equal treatment for all communities — whether
   it’s a religious minority in Myanmar, or an ethnic minority in Burundi, or
   a racial minority right here in the United States.  And surely, Israelis
   and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and
   recognize the legitimacy of Israel, but Israel recognizes that it cannot
   permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land.  We all have to do better
   as leaders in tamping down, rather than encouraging, a notion of identity
   that leads us to diminish others.
[Zionist lackey, anti-Arab anti-Semitic, pro-Apartheid, genocidally racist,
serial war criminal  and pathological liar  Obama obscenely blames the
victim with “Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians
reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel”. The dishonest
political  fiction of a “2-state solution” is now impossible with the
Zionist colonizers having ethnically cleansed 90% of Palestine in an
ongoing Palestinian Genocide by a nuclear terrorist, racist Zionist run,
genocidally racist, democracy by genocide Apartheid Israel that prevents
73% of its now 52%  majority  Indigenous Palestinian population from voting
for the government  ruling it. The racist  Zionists are now considering
only 2 options –  (a) continued Apartheid with 73% of Occupied Palestinians
highly abusively confined to the  Gaza Concentration Camp  or  West Bank
ghettoes or (b) outright genocidal expulsion of all or most Indigenous
Palestinian from Palestine (presently, of 12 million Indigenous
Palestinians about 50% are already totally excluded on pain of death from
living in their own country). Obama is committed to Israeli Apartheid and
the ongoing Palestinian Genocide as the front-man for the Neocon American
and Zionist Imperialist (NAZI)-perverted and subverted  US political
Establishment [10]].
   1. And this leads me to the fourth and final thing we need to do, and
   that is sustain our commitment to international cooperation rooted in the
   rights and responsibilities of nations.
[Obama as a serial invader and serial war criminal tramples on “the rights
and responsibilities of nations”, the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, the Rights of the Child, The UN Genocide Convention, the
Geneva Convention …].
   1. As President of the United States, I know that for most of human
   history, power has not been unipolar.  The end of the Cold War may have led
   too many to forget this truth.  I’ve noticed as President that at times,
   both America’s adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems
   were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington — and
   perhaps too many in Washington believed that as well.  (Laughter.)  But I
   believe America has been a rare superpower in human history insofar as it
   has been willing to think beyond narrow self-interest; that while we’ve
   made our share of mistakes over these last 25 years — and I’ve acknowledged
   some — we have strived, sometimes at great sacrifice, to align better our
   actions with our ideals.  And as a consequence, I believe we have been a
   force for good.
[Utter falsehood by a mendacious Obama who turns history on its head and
 whitewashes decades of utterly evil American war crimes throughout the
world. Under Obama alone the US Alliance has invaded 20 countries in the
 ongoing Muslim Genocide in the 21st century associated with 30 million
Muslim refugees and 32 million Muslim deaths from violence (5 million) or
from hegemony- or war-imposed deprivation (27 million) since the US
Government’s 9-11 false –flag atrocity [7-9]].
   1. We have secured allies.  We’ve acted to protect the vulnerable.  We
   supported human rights and welcomed scrutiny of our own actions.  We’ve
   bound our power to international laws and institutions.  When we’ve made
   mistakes, we’ve tried to acknowledge them.  We have worked to roll back
   poverty and hunger and disease beyond our borders, not just within our
   borders.
[The US under Obama has backed military coups, been associated with
invasions of 20 countries, supported Apartheid and genocide in Palestine,
opposed nuclear disarmament, and grossly violated human rights  at home and
abroad. Under Obama the coal-to-gas conversion by the US under Obama locks
in disastrous long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution and hence climate
change inaction for decades [48, 49],   17 million people die avoidably
from deprivation each year, about half of them children [4], and 7 million
die from air pollution each year [5, 6]. The 3 key threats to humanity are
(a) nuclear weapons, (b) poverty and (c ) climate change but under Obama
(a) the US increased its nuclear threat, continued to back nuclear
terrorist Apartheid Israel and opposed the nuclear weapons ban advocated by
about 130 countries [14]; (b) the US supports poverty-entrenching
 dictatorships, and of about $40 billion in annual US economic plus
military  aid, about $10 billion is military aid (40% to Apartheid Israel)
 and most of the remainder is linked to destructive US military
intervention; and (c) the pro-gas US is one of the worlds worst countries
for  annual per capita GHG pollution in terms of tonnes CO2-equivalent per
person per year (41.0 for the US, 8.9 world average, China 7.4 and India
2.1) and for  “income weighted annual per capita GHG pollution (US 207,
China 5.2 and India 0.3) [35, 36]].
   1. I’m proud of that.  But I also know that we can’t do this alone.  And
   I believe that if we’re to meet the challenges of this century, we are all
   going to have to do more to build up international capacity.  We cannot
   escape the prospect of nuclear war unless we all commit to stopping the
   spread of nuclear weapons and pursuing a world without them.
[ While imposing deadly Sanctions on Iran (that has zero nuclear weapons
and  repeatedly states that it does not want nuclear weapons and wants a
nuclear weapons-free Middle East), the US (7,315 nuclear weapons) is
boosting its nuclear and conventional forces in Asia and Australia, opposes
a nuclear weapons ban,  and continues to pour billions of dollars of
military aid into the war criminal, genocidally racist, ethnic cleansing
and nuclear terrorist rogue state of Apartheid Israel that reportedly has
up to 400 nuclear weapons, this having been acquired with US collaboration.
.  The upper  estimates of stored  nuclear weapons  are as follows: US
(7,315), Russia (8,000), Apartheid Israel (400), France (300), UK (250),
China (250), Pakistan (120), India (100), and North Korea (less than 10)
[14, 34]].
   1. When Iran agrees to accept constraints on its nuclear program that
   enhances global security and enhances Iran’s ability to work with other
   nations.  On the other hand, when North Korea tests a bomb that endangers
   all of us.  And any country that breaks this basic bargain must face
   consequences.  And those nations with these weapons, like the United
   States, have a unique responsibility to pursue the path of reducing our
   stockpiles, and reaffirming basic norms like the commitment to never test
   them again.
[see  The US is a world leader in nuclear terrorism. Iran does not have
nuclear weapons. Obama does not mention Apartheid Israel’s 400 nuclear
weapons [14, 34]].
   1. We can’t combat a disease like Zika that recognizes no borders —
   mosquitos don’t respect walls — unless we make permanent the same urgency
   that we brought to bear against Ebola — by strengthening our own systems of
   public health, by investing in cures and rolling back the root causes of
   disease, and helping poorer countries develop a public health
   infrastructure.
[  The dominant neoliberal ideology  in the US has ensured that
pharmaceutical advance is geared to highly profitable medicines for “White
folks” who can afford to buy them  –  however, the Ebola scare illustrated
how quickly US Big Pharma and medical research can move when “White folks”
are threatened. The efficacy of tens of thousands of medicines have been
determined in exhaustive trials based on “White folks” but their efficacy
has not been determined, for example,  for genetically diverse populations
in Africa].
   1. We can only eliminate extreme poverty if the sustainable development
   goals that we have set are more than words on paper. Human ingenuity now
   gives us the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our children —
   including our girls — the education that is the foundation for opportunity
   in our world.  But we have to put our money where our mouths are.
*[In terms of net official development assistance as “a percentage of gross
national income in 2015”, Sweden ranks top among OECD countries with 1.4%
whereas the US ranks 20th at 0.17% [66]]. *
   1. And we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding —
   to replace the ravages of war with cooperation — if powerful nations like
   my own accept constraints.  Sometimes I’m criticized in my own country for
   professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions.
   But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action —
   not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core
   interests, but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term
   — enhances our security.  And I think that’s not just true for us.
[With breathtaking arrogance Obama is saying that some time in the distant
future the US  might give up “some freedom of action” but it is “not giving
up our ability  … [to] pursue our core interests” i.e. an exceptionalist
 US will continue to subvert, threaten, invade, and devastate other
countries that reached an historical high for America under Nobel Peace
Prize winner but serial invader and serial war criminal Obama].
   1. If Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it
   may be popular at home, it may fuel nationalist fervor for a time, but over
   time it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less
   secure.  In the South China Sea, a peaceful resolution of disputes offered
   by law will mean far greater stability than the militarization of a few
   rocks and reefs.
[Russia responded to the racist, anti-Russian neo-Nazi coup in Ukraine that
was engineered and backed by the North America-located US; the
re-incorporation of strategically vital Crimea into Russia was
overwhelmingly supported by the Crimean population. The South China Sea is
called such  because it is off the coast of South China and not off the
coast of the North America-located US;  under anti-Arab anti-Semitic and
Islamophobic warmonger Obama the  US Alliance headed by the North
America-located US invaded 20 impoverished and distant countries in
pursuance of the Zionist-backed US War on Muslims (War on Terror) that has
been associated with 30 million Muslim refugees and 32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from hegemony- or war-imposed
deprivation (27 million) since the US Government’s 9-11 false –flag
atrocity [7-9]].
   1. We are all stakeholders in this international system, and it calls
   upon all of us to invest in the success of institutions to which we
   belong.  And the good news is, is that many nations have shown what kind of
   progress is possible when we make those commitments.  Consider what we’ve
   accomplished here over the past few years.
[Obama is using weasel words “stakeholders in this international system”
and “invest in the success of institutions” – what the US under Obama
should have been doing was obeying international laws and conventions,
instead of grossly violating these international laws and conventions].
   1. Together, we mobilized some 50,000 additional troops for U.N.
   peacekeeping, making them nimble, better equipped, better prepared to deal
   with emergencies.  Together, we established an Open Government Partnership
   so that, increasingly, transparency empowers more and more people around
   the globe.  And together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to
   help refugees who are desperate for a home.
[“US peace-keeping” is an oxymoron as evidenced by the Zionist–backed US
War on Muslims (War on Terror, Muslim Holocaust, Muslim Genocide) that has
been associated with 30 million Muslim refugees and 32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from hegemony- or war-imposed
deprivation (27 million) since the US Government’s 9-11 false –flag
atrocity [7-9]].
   1. We should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have
   been made at this General Assembly gathering.  I’ll be discussing that more
   this afternoon.  But we have to follow through, even when the politics are
   hard.  Because in the eyes of innocent men and women and children who,
   through no fault of their own, have had to flee everything that they know,
   everything that they love, we have to have the empathy to see ourselves.
   We have to imagine what it would be like for our family, for our children,
   if the unspeakable happened to us.  And we should all understand that,
   ultimately, our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those
   in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to
   accommodating these refugees.
[ Syria was an oasis of peace and religious tolerance and hosted more
refugees per capita that any other country – and then the US and the US
Alliance intervened with bombing and supporting terrorists to remove the
secular Syrian Government, killing 0.5 million people, generating 12
million Syrian refugees, and destroying this ancient country [9]].
   1. There are a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing.
   But many nations — particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits
   of geography — that can do more to offer a hand, even if they also insist
   that refugees who come to our countries have to do more to adapt to the
   customs and conventions of the communities that are now providing them a
   home.
[More breathtaking Obama dishonesty and implicit racism and bigotry; see
 – in terms of net official development assistance as “a percentage of
gross national income in 2015”, Sweden ranks top among OECD countries with
1.4% whereas the US ranks 20th at 0.17% [66]].
   1. Let me conclude by saying that I recognize history tells a different
   story than the one that I’ve talked about here today.  There’s a much
   darker and more cynical view of history that we can adopt.  Human beings
   are too often motivated by greed and by power.  Big countries for most of
   history have pushed smaller ones around.  Tribes and ethnic groups and
   nation states have very often found it most convenient to define themselves
   by what they hate and not just those ideas that bind them together.
[Obama actually tells the truth for once in admitting  his gross mendacity
and saying that “I recognize history tells a different story than the one
that I’ve talked about here today” [4]].
   1. Time and again, human beings have believed that they finally arrived
   at a period of enlightenment only to repeat, then, cycles of conflict and
   suffering.  Perhaps that’s our fate.  We have to remember that the choices
   of individual human beings led to repeated world war.  But we also have to
   remember that the choices of individual human beings created a United
   Nations, so that a war like that would never happen again.  Each of us as
   leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst
   impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best.  For we have shown that
   we can choose a better history.
[The UN was created to prevent  wars like WW2 that was associated with
violent deaths and avoidable deaths from deprivation totalling over 100
million. However US exceptionalism has meant that post-1950 US Asian wars
 have been associated with 40 million Asian deaths from violence or
war-imposed deprivation;1950-2005 avoidable deaths from deprivation in
countries occupied by the US in the post-1945 era have totalled 82 million
[4]; Muslim deaths from violence or imposed deprivation have totalled 32
million since 9-11, with Obama being directly involved in much of this
carnage; there are presently 65 million refugees in the world  of whom 30
million are Muslim refugees generated by a   genocidally  racist US or by
US-backed and genocidally racist Apartheid Israel [9]].
   1. Sitting in a prison cell, a young Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote that,
   “Human progress never rolls on the wheels of inevitability; it comes
   through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God.”
   And during the course of these eight years, as I’ve traveled to many of
   your nations, I have seen that spirit in our young people, who are more
   educated and more tolerant, and more inclusive and more diverse, and more
   creative than our generation; who are more empathetic and compassionate
   towards their fellow human beings than previous generations.  And, yes,
   some of that comes with the idealism of youth.  But it also comes with
   young people’s access to information about other peoples and places — an
   understanding unique in human history that their future is bound with the
   fates of other human beings on the other side of the world.
[Mass murderer, serial invader, serial war criminal and genocidal racist
Obama and his similarly  degenerate and   Zionist-perverted allies can
hardly be called “co-workers with God”].
   1. I think of the thousands of health care workers from around the world
   who volunteered to fight Ebola.  I remember the young entrepreneurs I met
   who are now starting new businesses in Cuba, the parliamentarians who used
   to be just a few years ago political prisoners in Myanmar.  I think of the
   girls who have braved taunts or violence just to go to school in
   Afghanistan, and the university students who started programs online to
   reject the extremism of organizations like ISIL.  I draw strength from the
   young Americans — entrepreneurs, activists, soldiers, new citizens — who
   are remaking our nation once again, who are unconstrained by old habits and
   old conventions, and unencumbered by what is, but are instead ready to
   seize what ought to be.
[How disgusting  that racist mass murderer Obama links himself to
courageous young humanitarians].
   1. My own family is a made up of the flesh and blood and traditions and
   cultures and faiths from a lot of different parts of the world — just as
   America has been built by immigrants from every shore.  And in my own life,
   in this country, and as President, I have learned that our identities do
   not have to be defined by putting someone else down, but can be enhanced by
   lifting somebody else up.  They don’t have to be defined in opposition to
   others, but rather by a belief in liberty and equality and justice and
   fairness.
[When truthful history is written, Obama will be defined by his
participation in the post-9-11 Muslim Holocaust and Muslim Genocide
associated with 30 million Muslim refugees and 32 million Muslim deaths
from violence – or from war - and hegemony-imposed deprivation [9]].
   1. And the embrace of these principles as universal doesn’t weaken my
   particular pride, my particular love for America — it strengthens it.  My
   belief that these ideals apply everywhere doesn’t lessen my commitment to
   help those who look like me, or pray as I do, or pledge allegiance to my
   flag.  But my faith in those principles does force me to expand my moral
   imagination and to recognize that I can best serve my own people, I can
   best look after my own daughters, by making sure that my actions seek what
   is right for all people and all children, and your daughters and your sons
[Gross hypocrisy by Obama  who is currently the world’s number 1
pathological liar, serial invader, warmonger, war criminal, child killer,
climate criminal,  and drug pusher. It is notable that Obama did not
mention illicit drugs in his speech. Also utterly ignored by Neocon
American and Zionist  Imperialist (NAZI)-perverted and subverted Western
Mainstream media are the 1.2 million people who have died world-wide since
9-11 due to US Alliance restoration of the Taliban-destroyed Afghan opium
industry from 6% of world market share in 2001 to 93% in 2007, the
breakdown (as of 2015)  including 280,000 Americans, 256,000 Indonesians,
68,000 Iranians, 25,000 British, 14,000 Canadians, 10,000 Germans, and
5,000 Australians [12]].
   1. This is what I believe:  that all of us can be co-workers with God.
   And our leadership, and our governments, and this United Nations should
   reflect this irreducible truth.
[This is what Obama blasphemously calls being “co-workers with God”: the
atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased to 405 ppm CO2 and is
increasing at a record 3 ppm CO2 per year; a catastrophic plus 2C
temperature rise is now unavoidable and the current plus 1C is already
catastrophic for tropical Island States and megadelta countries like
Bangladesh;  the plus 1.5C target may well be exceeded by 2020; the
coal-to-gas conversion by the US under Obama locks in disastrous long-term
greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution; 17 million people die avoidably each year;
7 million die from air pollution each year; the US Alliance has invaded 20
overwhelmingly or significantly Muslim countries since  the US Government’s
9-11 false flag atrocity, this being associated with 32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or hegemony-imposed
deprivation (27 million) [2, 4, 9, 67]. Of course the bottom line in any
human society  is respect for children but Obama has an appalling record
 of child killing. During the Vietnam War, decent people chanted “Hey, hey,
USA, how many kids did you kill today?” In May 2009  I catalogued  the
answer for America under Obama as 1,000 [68]].
   1. Thank you very much.  (Applause)
[Genuine gratitude one supposes by Obama who is currently the world’s
number 1 pathological liar, serial invader, warmonger, war criminal, child
killer, climate criminal,  and drug pusher but is free to operate as the
world’s current number 1 serial killer for another 3 months. Obama is
lauded as America’s first Black president but is complicit in the Muslim
Holocaust and Muslim Genocide that has taken 32 million non-European Muslim
lives  since the US Government’s 9-11 false-flag atrocity killed 3,000
people in 2001].
*Conclusions. *
Serial war criminal Barack Obama must be arraigned before the International
Criminal Court.  There  must be Boycotts, Divestment and Sanction (BDS)
against the United States and its war criminal allies until their  crimes
are recognized and punished and America and its allies undergo
 de-Nazification. The relatives, friends and fellow citizens of the 1.7
million Americans who die preventably each year must disempower the Neocon
American and Zionist  Imperialists (NAZIs) who have subverted and perverted
America and crippled America with the $40 trillion long-term accrual cost
of nuclear terrorist Apartheid Israel and attendant wars.
In 2005 Literature Nobel Laureate,  anti-racist Jewish British playwright
Harold Pinter declared that  Bush and Blair should be arraigned before the
International Criminal Court: “We have brought torture, cluster bombs,
depleted uranium, innumerable acts of random murder, misery, degradation
and death to the Iraqi people and call it “bringing freedom and democracy
to the Middle East”. How many people do you have to kill before you qualify
to be described as a mass murderer and a war criminal? One hundred
thousand? More than enough, I would have thought” [69]. 32 million? More
than enough I would have thought.

*Mendacious War Criminal Obama’s Final Speech To The UN General Assembly*
by Dr Gideon Polya (*) — CounterCurrents — September 24, 2016
America’s mendacious, serial invader,  war criminal, climate criminal and
human rights-violating  President Barack Obama made his last speech to the
UN General Assembly on 20 September 2016, a speech characterized by massive
lying by omission that is far, far worse than lying by commission because
the latter can at least be  refuted and subject to public debate. As
revealed by Edward Snowden, America spies on everyone in America and the
world, but Obama managed to comprehensively ignore a veritable Herd of
Elephants in the Room as detailed in the following analysis of his last UN
speech. As Dr Paul Craig Roberts has stated: “Washington lies about
The transcript of President Obama’s final speech to the UN [1] is
reproduced  below with key matters he has ignored set out succinctly in
square brackets, together with appropriate detailed documentation.
*PRESIDENT OBAMA:  *
   1. Mr. President; Mr. Secretary General; fellow delegates; ladies and
   gentlemen:  As I address this hall as President for the final time, let me
   recount the progress that we’ve made these last eight years.
[The atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased to 405 ppm CO2 and is
increasing at a record 3 ppm CO2 per year; a catastrophic plus 2C
temperature rise is now unavoidable, plus 1.5C may occur by 2020,  and the
current plus 1C is already catastrophic for tropical Island States and
megadelta countries like Bangladesh [2];  the coal-to-gas conversion by the
US under Obama locks in disastrous long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution
[3]; 17 million people die avoidably from deprivation each year, about half
of them children [4]; 7 million die from air pollution each year [5, 6];
the US Alliance has invaded 20 overwhelmingly or significantly Muslim
countries since the US Government’s 9-11 false flag atrocity, this being
associated with 32 million Muslim deaths from violence (5 million) or from
war- or hegemony-imposed deprivation (27 million) [7, 8] ].
   1. From the depths of the greatest financial crisis of our time, we
   coordinated our response to avoid further catastrophe and return the global
   economy to growth.  We’ve taken away terrorist safe havens, strengthened
   the nonproliferation regime, resolved the Iranian nuclear issue through
   diplomacy.  We opened relations with Cuba, helped Colombia end Latin
   America’s longest war, and we welcome a democratically elected leader of
   Myanmar to this Assembly.  Our assistance is helping people feed
   themselves, care for the sick, power communities across Africa, and promote
   models of development rather than dependence.  And we have made
   international institutions like the World Bank and the International
   Monetary Fund more representative, while establishing a framework to
   protect our planet from the ravages of climate change.
[US-complicit military coups in Honduras, Ukraine and Egypt; US-complicit
parliamentary coup in Brazil; US Alliance military intervention in 20
countries this century associated with the active or passive killing of 32
million Muslims[4, 7, 9-12] ; after the Global Financial Crisis the US
rewarded the banker criminals whereas Iceland sent them all to jail; the US
Alliance devastated Libya, formerly the richest country in Africa, and
devastated secular Syria, converting half the population to refugees in a
country that was formerly the world’s leading country for per capita
hosting of refugees [9]; the US Alliance  created ISIS in Iraq [11] and
backed ISIS in Syria against  the secular Assad Government in the interests
of Apartheid Israel, US hegemony and a “Sunni gas pipeline” from Qatar to
the Mediterranean [13]; while Iran has no nuclear weapons and declares it
does not want them, US-backed Apartheid Israel has as many as 400 nuclear
weapons and acquired them with US assistance [14]].
   1. This is important work.  It has made a real difference in the lives
   of our people.  And it could not have happened had we not worked together.
   And yet, around the globe we are seeing the same forces of global
   integration that have made us interdependent also expose deep fault lines
   in the existing international order.
[Under the existing international order 17 million people die avoidably
from deprivation each year on Spaceship Earth with a Neocon American and
Zionist  Imperialist (NAZI)-beholden US Government  in charge of the flight
deck [4]; America with 4% of the world’s population consumes 25% of its
resources; the variously dissident BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India,
China and South Africa) have moved toward an alternative, radical
proposition derived from the American Declaration of Independence,
specifically  that “all men are created equal”].
   1. We see it in the headlines every day.  Around the world, refugees
   flow across borders in flight from brutal conflict.  Financial disruptions
   continue to weigh upon our workers and entire communities.  Across vast
   swaths of the Middle East, basic security, basic order has broken down.  We
   see too many governments muzzling journalists, and quashing dissent, and
   censoring the flow of information.  Terrorist networks use social media to
   prey upon the minds of our youth, endangering open societies and spurring
   anger against innocent immigrants and Muslims.  Powerful nations contest
   the constraints placed on them by international law.
[There are 65 million refugees in the world today, half being  Muslims
fleeing genocidal US Alliance wars in their countries [9]; the US and US
Alliance countries are exceptionalist, ignore international law and
currently invade some 20 impoverished and largely or substantially Muslim
countries at will [7, 9]; the Obama Administrations and their lackey US
Alliance countries  have been complicit in  “muzzling journalists, and
quashing dissent, and censoring the flow of information” as illustrated by
the conduct of US –backed regimes throughout the world, through  the
“manufacturing consent” by compliant US and US Alliance Mainstream media
[15-17], and, notoriously,  by the US in relation to remorselessly
pursuing  the world hero whistle-blowers Chelsea Manning, Edward Snowden
and Julian Assange].
   1. This is the paradox that defines our world today.  A quarter century
   after the end of the Cold War, the world is by many measures less violent
   and more prosperous than ever before, and yet our societies are filled with
   uncertainty, and unease, and strife.  Despite enormous progress, as people
   lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions
   between nations become more quick to surface.
[People have lost trust in the mendacity of governments that is well
illustrated by the comprehensive mendacity of the Obama Administrations as
outlined here; the US Center for Public Integrity found that the Bush
Administration told 935 lies between 9-11 and the invasion of Iraq [18];
Pullitzer Prize-wining journalist Seymour Hersh dismissed Obama’s “official
story” of the extra-judicial killing of Osama bin-Laden as a  pack of lies
except for the killing [19] – Dr Paul Craig Roberts went one further and
stated that even the asserted killing of Osama bin-Laden was a lie [20];
numerous science, engineering, architecture, aviation, military and
intelligence experts reject the “lying Bush official version” of 9-11 [8]
but Obama  accepts it , strongly opposed release of documents revealing
Saudi complicity in 9-11, and is resolutely opposed to legislation allowing
the relatives of  9-11 victims to sue foreign governments over their loss;
lying and secrecy mean that Obama and the US Establishment are accessories
after the fact of the  9-11 atrocity].
   1. And so I believe that at this moment we all face a choice. We can
   choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and
   integration.  Or we can retreat into a world sharply divided, and
   ultimately in conflict, along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race
   and religion.
[The US has long rejected “age-old lines of nation” in relation to other
nations, and since 1776 has invaded over 70 nations [21]; with US troops on
the ground in Syria, the US presently has military bases in 75 nations
[23]; the US Alliance has been invading and devastating Muslim countries
since the US Government’s 9-11 false flag atrocity, this being associated
with 32 million Muslim deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or
hegemony-imposed deprivation (27 million) [7, 9]; the Neocon American and
Zionist  Imperialist (NAZI)-perverted and subverted US backs nuclear
terrorist, racist  Zionist (RZ)-run, genocidally racist,
democracy-by-genocide Apartheid Israel  that is obscenely based “along
age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion”;  the  long-term
accrual cost of US support for Apartheid Israel is at least $40 trillion
[24]; in one of his last acts as president, Obama announced a $38 billion
military package for serial war criminal Apartheid Israel over the next
decade [25]].
   1. I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward, and not
   backward.  I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open
   markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights and
   international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for
   human progress in this century.  I make this argument not based on theory
   or ideology, but on facts — facts that all too often, we forget in the
   immediacy of current events.
[The “open markets” espoused by Obama is theory and ideology;  Professor
Lord Nicholas Stern has described climate change inaction as the greatest
market failure in human history [26]; the presently dominant economic
ideology of neoliberalism means maximizing the freedom of the smart and
advantaged to exploit natural and human resources for private profit [27,
28], and has evidently failed, as evidenced by a continuing financial
crisis, a  worsening climate emergency (already catastrophic for some
countries) and a worsening climate genocide that will see 10 billion people
perishing this century if climate change is not requisitely addressed [29]].
   1. Here’s the most important fact:  The integration of our global
   economy has made life better for billions of men, women and children.  Over
   the last 25 years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been
   cut from nearly 40 percent of humanity to under 10 percent.  That’s
   unprecedented.  And it’s not an abstraction.  It means children have enough
   to eat; mothers don’t die in childbirth..
[According to World Hunger: “ The United Nations Food and Agriculture
Organization estimates that about 795 million people of the 7.3 billion
people in the world, or one in nine, were suffering from chronic
undernourishment in 2014-2016. Almost all the hungry people, 780 million,
live in developing countries, representing 12.9 percent, or one in eight,
of the population of developing counties” [30], i.e. in 2014-2016 about 11%
of the world suffered chronic undernourishment. 17 million people  die
avoidably each year from deprivation in the Developing World minus China ,
about half being children [4]. According to the World Bank “According to
the most recent estimates, in 2012, 12.7 percent of the world’s population
lived at or below $1.90 a day. That’s down from 37 percent in 1990 and 44
percent in 1981. This means that, in 2012, 896 million people lived on less
than $1.90 a day, compared with 1.95 billion in 1990, and 1.99 billion in
1981 ” [31] ].
   1. Meanwhile, cracking the genetic code promises to cure diseases that
   have plagued us for centuries.  The Internet can deliver the entirety of
   human knowledge to a young girl in a remote village on a single hand-held
   device.  In medicine and in manufacturing, in education and communications,
   we’re experiencing a transformation of how human beings live on a scale
   that recalls the revolutions in agriculture and industry.  And as a result,
   a person born today is more likely to be healthy, to live longer, and to
   have access to opportunity than at any time in human history.
[Obama’s optimistic Eurocentric vision does not apply to the Third Word in
which 17 million people die avoidably from deprivation and
deprivation-exacerbated disease each year [4]; there is a worsening climate
genocide that will see 10 billion people perishing this century if climate
change is not requisitely addressed [29]].
   1. Moreover, the collapse of colonialism and communism has allowed more
   people than ever before to live with the freedom to choose their leaders.
   Despite the real and troubling areas where freedom appears in retreat, the
   fact remains that the number of democracies around the world has nearly
   doubled in the last 25 years.
[Obama as a serial war criminal and serial invader has an appalling record
of denying numerous nations “the freedom to choose their leaders” – under
Obama the US Alliance has invaded 20 overwhelmingly or significantly Muslim
countries since  the US Government’s 9-11 false flag atrocity, this ongoing
Muslim Holocaust and Muslim Genocide being associated with 32 million
Muslim deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or hegemony-imposed
deprivation (27 million) since the US Government’s 9-11 false-flag atrocity
in 2001 [7-9]; under Obama the US has backed the removal of
democratically-elected government in Honduras and the Ukraine and of a
democratically-elected president in Brazil; under Obama the US continues to
subvert every nation on earth; most democracies are faux democracies in
which Big Money has replaced Democracy with Plutocracy, Kleptocracy,
Murdochracy, Lobbyocracy, Corporatocracy and Dollarocracy in which Big
Money purchases people, politicians, parties, public perception of reality,
political power and thence more private profit – with much of this Big
Money coming from tax-avoiding US corporations].
   1. In remote corners of the world, citizens are demanding respect for
   the dignity of all people no matter their gender, or race, or religion, or
   disability, or sexual orientation, and those who deny others dignity are
   subject to public reproach.  An explosion of social media has given
   ordinary people more ways to express themselves, and has raised people’s
   expectations for those of us in power.  Indeed, our international order has
   been so successful that we take it as a given that great powers no longer
   fight world wars; that the end of the Cold War lifted the shadow of nuclear
   Armageddon; that the battlefields of Europe have been replaced by peaceful
   union; that China and India remain on a path of remarkable growth.
[The overwhelmingly dominant One Percenter-owned Mainstream media are still
deceiving the  people and “manufacturing consent” [15]; the nuclear threat
remains – the upper  estimates of stored  nuclear weapons  are as follows:
US (7,315), Russia (8,000), Apartheid Israel (400), France (300), UK (250),
China (250), Pakistan (120), India (100), and North Korea (less than 10)
[32]; under Obama the US backed a neo-Nazi coup in the Ukraine and has
escalated military  confrontation in Eastern Europe leading to serious
fears of a nuclear and terminal WW3 [33, 34]; the rapid economic growth  of
the populous countries China and India means that CO2 pollution is
increasing at a record 3 ppm CO2 per year, although the annual per capita
greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution in tonnes CO2-equivalent  per person per
year is 8.9 (world average), 41.0 (US), 7.4 (China) and 2.1 (India) [35,
   1. I say all this not to whitewash the challenges we face, or to suggest
   complacency.  Rather, I believe that we need to acknowledge these
   achievements in order to summon the confidence to carry this progress
   forward and to make sure that we do not abandon those very things that have
   delivered this progress.
[See point  Obama is whitewashing the nuclear, poverty and climate
change threats [32, 33] – indeed Boycotts, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)
should be applied against the worst GHG polluting countries [35, 36] and
all countries that refuse to join the present 127  nations who support the
Nuclear Weapons Ban [34]].
   1. In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the
   existing path to global integration requires a course correction.  As too
   often, those trumpeting the benefits of globalization have ignored
   inequality within and among nations; have ignored the enduring appeal of
   ethnic and sectarian identities; have left international institutions
   ill-equipped, underfunded, under-resourced, in order to handle
   transnational challenges.
[Obama is egregiously guilty of such “ignoring” e.g. ignoring the   17
million people who die avoidably from deprivation each year, about half of
them children [4] and, within the US,  the over 27% of African Americans
who live in poverty [37]].
   1. And as these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions
   of the world have pressed forward both in the wealthiest countries and in
   the poorest:  Religious fundamentalism; the politics of ethnicity, or
   tribe, or sect; aggressive nationalism; a crude populism — sometimes from
   the far left, but more often from the far right — which seeks to restore
   what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination.
[Under serial invader and serial war criminal Obama an “exceptionalist” US
has continued   “aggressive nationalism” with the US Alliance invading  20
overwhelmingly or significantly Muslim countries since  the US Government’s
9-11 false flag atrocity, this being associated with 32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or hegemony-imposed
deprivation (27 million) [7, 8] ]; “religious fundamentalism; the politics
of ethnicity, or tribe, or sect; aggressive nationalism; a crude populism”
are exhibited by US-backed, nuclear terrorist, racist Zionist-run,
genocidally racist, democracy-by-genocide, neo-Nazi Apartheid Israel in its
ongoing Palestinian Genocide [10] and its powerful espousal  via the
Zionist Lobby of the ongoing Muslim Holocaust and Muslim Genocide [7-9, 11,
   1. We cannot dismiss these visions.  They are powerful.  They reflect
   dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens.  I do not believe those
   visions can deliver security or prosperity over the long term, but I do
   believe that these visions fail to recognize, at a very basic level, our
   common humanity.  Moreover, I believe that the acceleration of travel and
   technology and telecommunications — together with a global economy that
   depends on a global supply chain — makes it self-defeating ultimately for
   those who seek to reverse this progress.  Today, a nation ringed by walls
   would only imprison itself.
[“Dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens” – the “too many”  have an
awful lot to  be dissatisfied about both globally and domestically in the
US. Thus globally nearly 1 billion live in dire poverty and suffer chronic
malnourishment [30, 31] with 17 million dying  from deprivation annually,
about half being children [4], and the Muslim world subject to a Muslim
Holocaust and Muslim Genocide in which  there have been  32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or hegemony-imposed
deprivation (27 million) since the US Government’s 9-11 false-flag atrocity
in 2001 [7, 8]. Domestically, 1.7 million Americans die preventably each
year, this carnage being inescapably linked to the fiscal perversions of
the $40 trillion long-term accrual cost of Apartheid Israel to America [38]
and successive  Neocon American and Zionist Imperialist  (NAZI)-perverted
 Administrations  committing trillions of dollars to killing Muslims abroad
in the War on Terror (the War on Muslims) rather than keeping Americans
alive at home [39]. American incomes have flat-lined for decades of course,
as for African Americans under America’s  first black president, 27% live
in poverty, *African American wealth is about 5 times lower  than that of
 Whites, millions of African Americans are excluded from voting, African
Americans are 8 times more likely to murder and 6 times more likely to be
murdered than Whites, Educational Apartheid has meant return of Segregation
with a vengeance, and African Americans  and Hispanic Americans  have
 about half their “fair share” of representatives  in Congress and 5-6
times less Congressional  representation than  Jewish Americans (despite
being collectively about 10 times more population-wise) [37]].*
   1. So the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration.
   Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such
   integration are broadly shared, and that the disruptions — economic,
   political, and cultural — that are caused by integration are squarely
   addressed.  This is not the place for a detailed policy blueprint, but let
   me offer in broad strokes those areas where I believe we must do better
   together.
[“Global integration” means that manufacturing jobs go to where the wages
are lowest in a new version of slavery that ignores the fundamental human
right to a decent life. The British (a) abolished slavery in Britain when
rural  Enclosures generated the effective slavery of a minimum wage
industrial working class; (b) later replaced slavery in the British
colonies by minimally paid “indentured labour” (e.g. the “5-year slavery of
Indian indentured labour in Fiji that finally ceased in 1922 [40] ); and
(c) today exploit Third World labour by the effective slavery of “global
integration” ].
   1. It starts with making the global economy work better for all people
   and not just for those at the top.  While open markets, capitalism have
   raised standards of living around the globe, globalization combined with
   rapid progress and technology has also weakened the position of workers and
   their ability to secure a decent wage.  In advanced economies like my own,
   unions have been undermined, and many manufacturing jobs have disappeared.
   Often, those who benefit most from globalization have used their political
   power to further undermine the position of workers.
[In the US the average wage has flat-lined in real terms for decades  but
the One Percenter and Ten Percenter share of annual income has steadily
increased for decades, this phenomenon also obtaining  elsewhere in the
Anglosphere [41-43].
   1. In developing countries, labor organizations have often been
   suppressed, and the growth of the middle class has been held back by
   corruption and underinvestment.  Mercantilist policies pursued by
   governments with export-driven models threaten to undermine the consensus
   that underpins global trade.  And meanwhile, global capital is too often
   unaccountable — nearly $8 trillion stashed away in tax havens, a shadow
   banking system that grows beyond the reach of effective oversight.
[US corporations are massively involved in egregious global tax avoidance
which contributes to the inequity that in turn drives the Global Avoidable
Mortality  Holocaust in which 17 million people die avoidably from
deprivation every year [4]. By backing anti-democratic neofascist and
neoliberal regimes around the world, America, including the US under Obama,
 massively  contributes to suppression of labour organizations].
   1. A world in which one percent of humanity controls as much wealth as
   the other 99 percent will never be stable.  I understand that the gaps
   between rich and poor are not new, but just as the child in a slum today
   can see the skyscraper nearby, technology now allows any person with a
   smartphone to see how the most privileged among us live and the contrast
   between their own lives and others.  Expectations rise, then, faster than
   governments can deliver, and a pervasive sense of injustice undermine
   people’s faith in the system.
[But in harsh reality Obama is part of the One Percent,  represents the One
Percent politically  and is dedicated to the deceit, manipulation and
variously egregiously violent suppression of the 99%].
   1. So how do we fix this imbalance?  We cannot unwind integration any
   more than we can stuff technology back into a box.  Nor can we look to
   failed models of the past.  If we start resorting to trade wars, market
   distorting subsidies, beggar thy neighbor policies, an overreliance on
   natural resources instead of innovation — these approaches will make us
   poorer, collectively, and they are more like to lead to conflict.  And the
   stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the
   wasteland of North Korea shows that central, planned control of the economy
   is a dead end.
[Professor Thomas Piketty in his seminal book “Capital  in the Twenty-First
Century” argues that gross inequity damages democracy (Big Money buys
votes) and damages the economy (the poor cannot afford to buy the goods and
services they produce) . Piketty argues for wealth transparency and  a
global annual wealth tax of up to 10% [41, 42], noting that France has an
annual wealth tax of up to 1.5% and Islam has had an annual wealth tax of
2.5% (zakkat) for 1,400 years [43].   It is estimated that an annual
 global wealth tax of 4% could abolish the Global Avoidable Mortality
 Holocaust and prevent  17 million people from dying  avoidably from
deprivation every year  – an annual global wealth tax of about 4% would
yield US$16 trillion annually and enable raising all countries to annual
per capita incomes equivalent to the $6,000 per person per year of China
and Cuba, countries for which annual avoidable mortality is zero (0) [44].
One can well understand why One Percenter Obama ignores the wealth tax
option. As for North Korea, it has been subject to frightening military
hostility from the genocidally violent US for about 70 years, and US
bombing in 1950-1953 killed 28% of the population [45]].
   1. But I do believe there’s another path — one that fuels growth and
   innovation, and offers the clearest route to individual opportunity and
   national success.  It does not require succumbing to a soulless capitalism
   that benefits only the few, but rather recognizes that economies are more
   successful when we close the gap between rich and poor, and growth is
   broadly based. And that means respecting the rights of workers so they can
   organize into independent unions and earn a living wage.  It means
   investing in our people — their skills, their education, their capacity to
   take an idea and turn it into a business.  It means strengthening the
   safety net that protects our people from hardship and allows them to take
   more risks — to look for a new job, or start a new venture.
[Great rhetoric from a neoliberal, corporatist, One Percenter president
Obama  under whom 1.7 million Americans die preventably every year [39]].
   1. These are the policies that I’ve pursued here in the United States,
   and with clear results.  American businesses have created now 15 million
   new jobs.  After the recession, the top one percent of Americans were
   capturing more than 90 percent of income growth.  But today, that’s down to
   about half.  Last year, poverty in this country fell at the fastest rate in
   nearly 50 years.  And with further investment in infrastructure and early
   childhood education and basic research, I’m confident that such progress
   will continue.
[One Percenter Obama is boasting that the One Percenters “only” captured
45% of income growth after the recession].
   1. So just as I’ve pursued these measures here at home, so has the
   United States worked with many nations to curb the excesses of capitalism —
   not to punish wealth, but to prevent repeated crises that can destroy it.
   That’s why we’ve worked with other nations to create higher and clearer
   standards for banking and taxation — because a society that asks less of
   oligarchs than ordinary citizens will rot from within.  That’s why we’ve
   pushed for transparency and cooperation in rooting out corruption, and
   tracking illicit dollars, because markets create more jobs when they’re
   fueled by hard work, and not the capacity to extort a bribe.  That’s why
   we’ve worked to reach trade agreements that raise labor standards and raise
   environmental standards, as we’ve done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership,
   so that the benefits are more broadly shared.
[The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) is supported by US corporations but
opposed by both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton because  it will export
American jobs to low wage countries. The TPP is opposed by thoughtful
pro-environment people in the Pacific Rim  because it will enable US
corporations to successfully sue governments for losses due to
pro-environment legislation and other  pro-environment actions].
   1. And just as we benefit by combating inequality within our countries,
   I believe advanced economies still need to do more to close the gap between
   rich and poor nations around the globe.  This is difficult politically.
   It’s difficult to spend on foreign assistance.  But I do not believe this
   is charity.  For the small fraction of what we spent at war in Iraq we
   could support institutions so that fragile states don’t collapse in the
   first place, and invest in emerging economies that become markets for our
   goods.  It’s not just the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do.
[For the serial war criminal US to stop  perverting, subverting,  invading
and devastating “fragile states” would be an obvious way of preventing them
from collapsing. Thus the US Alliance under Obama has been war criminally
 invading and devastating 20 substantially or significantly  Muslim
countries,  impoverished nations in which 32 million Muslims have died from
violence (5 million) or from hegemony- and war-imposed deprivation (27
million) since 2001 [4, 7, 9]. The US-led France, UK and US (FUKUS)
Coalition  devastated Libya (0.1 million dead, 1 million refugees).  Libya
was formerly  the richest country in Africa [4, 7, 9]].
   1. And that’s why we need to follow through on our efforts to combat
   climate change.  If we don’t act boldly, the bill that could come due will
   be mass migrations, and cities submerged and nations displaced, and food
   supplies decimated, and conflicts born of despair.  The Paris Agreement
   gives us a framework to act, but only if we scale up our ambition.  And
   there must be a sense of urgency about bringing the agreement into force,
   and helping poorer countries leapfrog destructive forms of energy.
[The atmospheric CO2 concentration is now 405 ppm CO2 and increasing at a
record 3 ppm CO2 per year; the species extinction rate is now 100-1,000
times greater than normal, this giving rise to the term Anthropocene to
 describe the present era and the speciescide and ecocide, leading to
omnicide and terracide – the killing of our  Living Planet;  coral reefs
are hugely important ocean ecosystems,  but they started bleaching
worldwide when the atmospheric CO2 reached 320 ppm CO2, are endangered at
the current 405 ppm CO2,  and are essentially doomed in a mere 15 years’
time at the 450 ppm CO2  predicted from the current increase at 3 ppm CO2
per year. The annual per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution in tonnes
CO2-equivalent  per person per year is 8.9 (world average), 41.0 (US), 7.4
(China) and 2.1 (India)  [35, 36]. Paris-recognized as catastrophic, a plus
2C temperature rise is now unavoidable and the present circa plus 1C is
already disastrous for tropical Island Nations and tropical mega-delta
countries like Bangladesh [1, 2]. Indeed the lower Paris “target” of no
more than plus 1.5C may be exceeded as early as 2020 [46]]. Under Obama the
US has embarked on a massive coal-to-gas transition that locks in dirty
energy for decades and due to systemic gas leakage, gas burning for power
 could be dirtier GHG-wise than coal burning [47-50].
   1. So, for the wealthiest countries, a Green Climate Fund should only be
   the beginning.  We need to invest in research and provide market incentives
   to develop new technologies, and then make these technologies accessible
   and affordable for poorer countries.  And only then can we continue lifting
   all people up from poverty without condemning our children to a planet
   beyond their capacity to repair.
[Not mentioned by Obama, we urgently need to stop burning carbon fuels,
deforestation, methanogenic livestock production and population growth now.
It is already too late to avoid massive damage.  “Condemning our children
to a planet beyond their capacity to repair” has effectively already
happened. Thus assuming a damage-related Carbon Price in US Dollars of
$200 per tonne CO2-equivalent  (as estimated by Dr Chris Hope of
 90-Nobel-Laureate University of Cambridge),  the World has n inescapable
Carbon Debt of $360 trillion that is increasing at $13 trillion per year,
and, for example,  US lackey, climate criminal Australia, a world-leader in
annual per capita greenhouse (GHG) gas pollution,  has a Carbon Debt of
$7.5 trillion that is increasing at $400 billion per year and at $40,000
per head per year for under-30 year old Australians. Young people will
inescapably have to pay this huge and increasing Carbon Debt – thus unless
gigantic 20 meter sea walls are built, coastal cities will drown [47].
Young people  must wise up and demand urgent climate action [51-55] and
indeed a Climate Revolution now! [55]].
   1. So we need new models for the global marketplace, models that are
   inclusive and sustainable.  And in the same way, we need models of
   governance that are inclusive and accountable to ordinary people.
[ What gross deception and hypocrisy by Obama. American policy (“model of
governance”) has always been “might is right” when it comes to exploitable
resources. To that end, the US has invaded 71 countries, has military bases
in 75 and subverts every country on earth.  Thus the Iraq War continued
under Obama and has now transmuted into an endless War on Terror due to the
US-provoked rise of ISIS in Iraq and US Alliance support for this barbarous
terrorist organization in Syria against the secular Assad regime. The US
allies Turkey, Qatar. Apartheid Israel and Saudi Arabia contributed
significantly  to the rise  ISIS in Syria, this being consonant with US
policy to remove the secular Assad regime. Alan Greenspan on the Right and
Noam Chomsky on the Left both say that the Iraq War was about oil. US
Establishment intimate Robert Kennedy Junior says that the Syrian War is in
essence about a “Sunni gas pipeline” from Qatar [13]].
   1. I recognize not every country in this hall is going to follow the
   same model of governance.  I do not think that America can — or should —
   impose our system of government on other countries.  But there appears to
   be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now.  And
   I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest.  I
   believe in a liberal political order — an order built not just through
   elections and representative government, but also through respect for human
   rights and civil society, and independent judiciaries and the rule of law.
[Further egregious hypocrisy. America has repeatedly imposed its “system of
government” on other countries [4, 13, 21]. America  has invaded 71
countries, has military  bases in 75 countries and indeed subverts all
countries in the world. Under war criminal Obama, the US Alliance has
invaded 20 countries  [4, 21-23].   US drone strikes, targeted with the
help of US lackey Australia, are presently  being conducted against Libya,
Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan. Indeed it seems
likely that world-leading US-Apartheid Israeli drone technology was
involved in the 9-11 attacks on the US itself  (the alternative to this
hypothesis in the lying Bush “official version” of 9-11, to whit  that
people learning to fly tiny, single-engined  aircraft  were able to land
huge  passenger jets at high speed on a dime) [8].  How the US  has
repeatedly “impose[d] our system of government on other countries” was
explained by former CIA operative Philip Agee in his book “CIA Diary.
Inside the Company” in relation  to the US invasion of the Dominican
Republic [4] – invade, and then ban,  imprison, torture, kill or   exile
all those you don’t like and then hold “democratic elections” [56]].
   1. I know that some countries, which now recognize the power of free
   markets, still reject the model of free societies.  And perhaps those of us
   who have been promoting democracy feel somewhat discouraged since the end
   of the Cold War, because we’ve learned that liberal democracy will not just
   wash across the globe in a single wave.  It turns out building accountable
   institutions is hard work — the work of generations.  The gains are often
   fragile.  Sometimes we take one step forward and then two steps back.  In
   countries held together by borders drawn by colonial powers, with ethnic
   enclaves and tribal divisions, politics and elections can sometimes appear
   to be a zero-sum game.  And so, given the difficulty in forging true
   democracy in the face of these pressures, it’s no surprise that some argue
   the future favors the strongman, a top-down model, rather than strong,
   democratic institutions.
[Obama’s “true democracy” in the West has degenerated into  Big
Money-controlled  Plutocracy, Kleptocracy, Murdochracy, Lobbyocracy,
Corporatocracy and Dollarocracy in which Big Money purchases people,
politicians, parties, public perception of reality, political power and
thence more private profit. Fundamentally, democracy is about practical
 expression of the will of the people and in 1-party Cuba the desire of the
people for good  governance, health, and education has been met – despite
decades of war criminal US sanctions, Cuba has excellent health services,
female literacy is high  and infant mortality is the same as in the US [4]].
   1. But I believe this thinking is wrong.  I believe the road of true
   democracy remains the better path.  I believe that in the 21st century,
   economies can only grow to a certain point until they need to open up —
   because entrepreneurs need to access information in order to invent; young
   people need a global education in order to thrive; independent media needs
   to check the abuses of power.  Without this evolution, ultimately
   expectations of people will not be met; suppression and stagnation will set
   in.  And history shows that strongmen are then left with two paths —
   permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies
   abroad, which can lead to war.
[War criminal Obama certainly knows about war – under war criminal Obama
the US Alliance has invaded 20 countries and civilized people dread the
prospect of a Hillary Clinton Administration in which she will set out to
prove that she is a “real man” by following and indeed exceeding Obama’s
murderous example].
   1. Now, I will admit, my belief that governments serve the individual,
   and not the other way around, is shaped by America’s story.  Our nation
   began with a promise of freedom that applied only to the few.  But because
   of our democratic Constitution, because of our Bill of Rights, because of
   our ideals, ordinary people were able to organize, and march, and protest,
   and ultimately, those ideals won out — opened doors for women and
   minorities and workers in ways that made our economy more productive and
   turned our diversity into a strength; that gave innovators the chance to
   transform every area of human endeavor; that made it possible for someone
   like me to be elected President of the United States.
[A blood-thirsty Simon Legree rather than a subservient Uncle Tom, One
Percenter Obama is the willing servant of the Neocon American and Zionist
Imperialist  (NAZI)-dominated One Percenter Establishment running America.
Indeed Obama is a classic example of the embodiment of the dominant
“Whiteness” culture of America.  For  African Americans under America’s
 first Black president, 27% live in poverty, *African American wealth is
about 5 times lower  than that of  Whites, millions of African Americans
are excluded from voting, African Americans are 8 times more likely to
murder and 6 times more likely to be murdered than Whites, Educational
Apartheid has meant return of Segregation with a vengeance, and African
Americans  and Hispanic Americans  have  about half their “fair share” of
representatives  in Congress and 5-6 times less Congressional
 representation than  Jewish Americans (despite being collectively about 10
times more populous) [37]].*
   1. So, yes, my views are shaped by the specific experiences of America,
   but I do not think this story is unique to America.  Look at the
   transformation that’s taken place in countries as different as Japan and
   Chile, Indonesia, Botswana.  The countries that have succeeded are ones in
   which people feel they have a stake.
[However Obama’s asserted support for one-person-one-vote  is contradicted
by his  fanatical  support for nuclear terrorist, racist Zionist-run,
genocidally racist, democracy-by-genocide, neo-Nazi Apartheid Israel that
denies 73% of its now 52% majority of Indigenous Palestinians the right to
vote for the government ruling them. Obama is a genocidal  racist,
anti-Arab anti-Semite  and pathological  liar in his support for Apartheid
Israel in its ongoing Palestinian Genocide [10]].
   1. In Europe, the progress of those countries in the former Soviet bloc
   that embraced democracy stand in clear contrast to those that did not.
   After all, the people of Ukraine did not take to the streets because of
   some plot imposed from abroad.  They took to the streets because their
   leadership was for sale and they had no recourse.  They demanded change
   because they saw life get better for people in the Baltics and in Poland,
   societies that were more liberal, and democratic, and open than their own.
[The neo-Nazi coup that overthrew the democratically elected government  in
the Ukraine was backed by the US].
   1. So those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out
   forcefully, because both the facts and history, I believe, are on our
   side.  That doesn’t mean democracies are without flaws.  It does mean that
   the cure for what ails our democracies is greater engagement by our
   citizens — not less.
[See point  – racist Obama supports Apartheid in Palestine   just as his
racist presidential predecessors supported Apartheid in South Africa [4]].
   1. Yes, in America, there is too much money in politics; too much
   entrenched partisanship; too little participation by citizens, in part
   because of a patchwork of laws that makes it harder to vote.  In Europe, a
   well-intentioned Brussels often became too isolated from the normal push
   and pull of national politics.  Too often, in capitals, decision-makers
   have forgotten that democracy needs to be driven by civic engagement from
   the bottom up, not governance by experts from the top down.  And so these
   are real problems, and as leaders of democratic governments make the case
   for democracy abroad, we better strive harder to set a better example at
   home.
[Under Barack “Simon Legree” Obama, millions of Black Americans are denied
the vote under anti-felony laws and according to Dr Michelle Alexander of
the NAACP, nearly 80% of adult male Black Americans in Chicago are denied
the right to vote [57, 58]].
   1. Moreover, every country will organize its government informed by
   centuries of history, and the circumstances of geography, and the deeply
   held beliefs of its people.  So I recognize a traditional society may value
   unity and cohesion more than a diverse country like my own, which was
   founded upon what, at the time, was a radical idea — the idea of the
   liberty of individual human beings endowed with certain God-given rights.
   But that does not mean that ordinary people in Asia, or Africa, or the
   Middle East somehow prefer arbitrary rule that denies them a voice in the
   decisions that can shape their lives.  I believe that spirit is universal.
   And if any of you doubt the universality of that desire, listen to the
   voices of young people everywhere who call out for freedom, and dignity,
   and the opportunity to control their own lives.
[Unfortunately,  that asserted “liberty of the individual” in the
ostensibly  marvellous 1776 American Declaration of Independence  in
reality was freedom to invade, conquer, devastate and ethnically cleanse
Indigenous American  lands – indeed the real  purpose of the American War
of Independence was not “no taxation without representation” or “personal
liberty” but freedom to exterminate Indigenous Indians that had some
protection from the British in the context of the 18th century Anglo-French
war. [4].  By 1844 the United States, founded on the dream of genocide,
 had legislated to remove all Indigenous Indians from East of the
Mississippi [4]].
   1. This leads me to the third thing we need to do:  We must reject any
   forms of fundamentalism, or racism, or a belief in ethnic superiority that
   makes our traditional identities irreconcilable with modernity.  Instead we
   need to embrace the tolerance that results from respect of all human beings.
[The ultimate expression of racism is war.  Under war criminal Obama, the
US Alliance has invaded 20 countries  [4, 21-23].   US drone strikes,
targetted with the help of  US lackey Australia, are presently  being
conducted against Libya, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and
Pakistan. Obama is one of the worst warmonger and war-making presidents and
hence one of the worst racists in American history  [4]].
   1. It’s a truism that global integration has led to a collision of
   cultures; trade, migration, the Internet, all these things can challenge
   and unsettle our most cherished identities.  We see liberal societies
   express opposition when women choose to cover themselves.  We see protests
   responding to Western newspaper cartoons that caricature the Prophet
   Muhammad.  In a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia
   attempting to recover lost glory through force.  Asian powers debate
   competing claims of history.  And in Europe and the United States, you see
   people wrestle with concerns about immigration and changing demographics,
   and suggesting that somehow people who look different are corrupting the
   character of our countries.
[The people of Crimea overwhelmingly voted for linkage to Russia after the
US-backed neo-Nazi Coup in the Ukraine. Anti-Semite Obama backs the
genocidally  racist,  colonizer,  and  Apartheid rogue state of Israel in
its illegal occupation and ethnic  cleansing of Arab lands].
   1. Now, there’s no easy answer for resolving all these social forces,
   and we must respect the meaning that people draw from their own traditions
   — from their religion, from their ethnicity, from their sense of
   nationhood.  But I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to
   preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate
   another group. If our religion leads us to persecute those of another
   faith, if we jail or beat people who are gay, if our traditions lead us to
   prevent girls from going to school, if we discriminate on the basis of race
   or tribe or ethnicity, then the fragile bonds of civilization will fray.
   The world is too small, we are too packed together, for us to be able to
   resort to those old ways of thinking.
[Obama as a pluralist liberal simply doesn’t wash – he is a racist
 warmonger heading a US Alliance that is making war in 20 impoverished
countries [4, 7-13]].
   1. We see this mindset in too many parts of the Middle East.  There, so
   much of the collapse in order has been fueled because leaders sought
   legitimacy not because of policies or programs but by resorting to
   persecuting political opposition, or demonizing other religious sects, by
   narrowing the public space to the mosque, where in too many places
   perversions of a great faith were tolerated.  These forces built up for
   years, and are now at work helping to fuel both Syria’s tragic civil war
   and the mindless, medieval menace of ISIL.
[ISIL (ISIS) arose directly from the Iraqi Genocide under the Bush and
Obama Administration that involved destruction of a modern state, 2.7
million Iraqi deaths from violence (1.5 million) or from war-imposed
deprivation (1.2 million), and massive disempowerment of the Iraqi Sunni
minority. The US created ISIS just as it created Al Qaeda and the Taliban.
ISIS in Syria has been enabled, funded and backed by US Alliance  members
 Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia in particular. Muslim-origin non-state
terrorism  is the greatest ally of US imperialism – every mindless atrocity
against Westerners is used as an excuse for vastly more deadly  US Alliance
attacks on Muslim populations in 20 countries from the Western Sahel to
South East Asia. ISIS and similar groups have enabled US or US Alliance
military domination over  a huge swathe of the Muslim world.
   1. The mindset of sectarianism, and extremism, and blood-letting, and
   retribution that has been taking place will not be quickly reversed.  And
   if we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able
   to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to co-exist
   for long.  But I do believe we have to be honest about the nature of these
   conflicts, and our international community must continue to work with those
   who seek to build rather than to destroy.
[ America under anti-Arab anti-Semitic warmonger Obama has devastated a
swathe of Muslim countries [4, 7-13]].
   1. And there is a military component to that.  It means being united and
   relentless in destroying networks like ISIL, which show no respect for
   human life.  But it also means that in a place like Syria, where there’s no
   ultimate military victory to be won, we’re going to have to pursue the hard
   work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence, and deliver aid to those
   in need, and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see
   those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.
[How disingenuous of  Obama to say “and there is a military  component to
that” in relation to his false assertion that the US and its allies “seek
to build rather than to destroy”. Obama seeks to change the government of
Syria and its efforts have killed 0.5 million Syrians, generated 12 million
refugees, and devastated what was once a peaceful, tolerant , secular
society in which numerous ancient faiths and sects got along peacefully
with each other as described  in William Dalrymple’s superb book “From the
Holy Mountain” [59]].
   1. Across the region’s conflicts, we have to insist that all parties
   recognize a common humanity and that nations end proxy wars that fuel
   disorder.  Because until basic questions are answered about how communities
   co-exist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human
   beings will suffer — most of all in that region — but extremism will
   continue to be exported overseas.  And the world is too small for us to
   simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own
   societies.
[The worst extremism being “exported overseas” is US imperialism  and US
Alliance imperialism. The casus belli (excuse for war) is provided by
US-created or US-provoked Muslim-origin non-state terrorists such as the
barbarous ISIS whose outrageous conduct (beheadings, sex slaves, forced
conversions, religious fanaticism, and  religious intolerance) could not
have been better scripted by the CIA.  One is reminded of US-lead terrorist
groups in Ecuador who would bomb Catholic churches so that the socialists
would be blamed [56] and similar US-led Gladio atrocities in Europe that
were designed to be blamed on “communists” [60].   Numerous science,
engineering, architecture, medicine, aviation, military and intelligence
experts conclude that the US Government  was responsible for the singular
9-11 atrocity in which 3,000 people died  [8, 22, 61-63]). However
post-9-11 terror hysteria has been used to attack civil liberties in the US
and in the West in general. Reality:  53 American residents were  killed in
America by “terrorists” in the 14 years since 9/11 and the average  US
population in this period was about 304 million (UN Population Division
data). Accordingly, the “empirical annual probability of an American dying
in the US from terrorism” is 53/(14 years x 304 million) =  about 1 in 100
million per year. In contrast, 1.7million American die preventably each
year as the Neocon American and Zionist Imperialist  (NAZI)-subverted US
Government steadfastly looks the other way and scares the population with
saturation terror hysteria propaganda  [64]].
   1. And what is true in the Middle East is true for all of us.  Surely,
   religious traditions can be honored and upheld while teaching young people
   science and math, rather than intolerance. Surely, we can sustain our
   unique traditions while giving women their full and rightful role in the
   politics and economics of a nation.  Surely, we can rally our nations to
   solidarity while recognizing equal treatment for all communities — whether
   it’s a religious minority in Myanmar, or an ethnic minority in Burundi, or
   a racial minority right here in the United States.  And surely, Israelis
   and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and
   recognize the legitimacy of Israel, but Israel recognizes that it cannot
   permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land.  We all have to do better
   as leaders in tamping down, rather than encouraging, a notion of identity
   that leads us to diminish others.
[Zionist lackey, anti-Arab anti-Semitic, pro-Apartheid, genocidally racist,
serial war criminal  and pathological liar  Obama obscenely blames the
victim with “Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians
reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel”. The dishonest
political  fiction of a “2-state solution” is now impossible with the
Zionist colonizers having ethnically cleansed 90% of Palestine in an
ongoing Palestinian Genocide by a nuclear terrorist, racist Zionist run,
genocidally racist, democracy by genocide Apartheid Israel that prevents
73% of its now 52%  majority  Indigenous Palestinian population from voting
for the government  ruling it. The racist  Zionists are now considering
only 2 options –  (a) continued Apartheid with 73% of Occupied Palestinians
highly abusively confined to the  Gaza Concentration Camp  or  West Bank
ghettoes or (b) outright genocidal expulsion of all or most Indigenous
Palestinian from Palestine (presently, of 12 million Indigenous
Palestinians about 50% are already totally excluded on pain of death from
living in their own country). Obama is committed to Israeli Apartheid and
the ongoing Palestinian Genocide as the front-man for the Neocon American
and Zionist Imperialist (NAZI)-perverted and subverted  US political
Establishment [10]].
   1. And this leads me to the fourth and final thing we need to do, and
   that is sustain our commitment to international cooperation rooted in the
   rights and responsibilities of nations.
[Obama as a serial invader and serial war criminal tramples on “the rights
and responsibilities of nations”, the UN Charter, the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, the Rights of the Child, The UN Genocide Convention, the
Geneva Convention …].
   1. As President of the United States, I know that for most of human
   history, power has not been unipolar.  The end of the Cold War may have led
   too many to forget this truth.  I’ve noticed as President that at times,
   both America’s adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems
   were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington — and
   perhaps too many in Washington believed that as well.  (Laughter.)  But I
   believe America has been a rare superpower in human history insofar as it
   has been willing to think beyond narrow self-interest; that while we’ve
   made our share of mistakes over these last 25 years — and I’ve acknowledged
   some — we have strived, sometimes at great sacrifice, to align better our
   actions with our ideals.  And as a consequence, I believe we have been a
   force for good.
[Utter falsehood by a mendacious Obama who turns history on its head and
 whitewashes decades of utterly evil American war crimes throughout the
world. Under Obama alone the US Alliance has invaded 20 countries in the
 ongoing Muslim Genocide in the 21st century associated with 30 million
Muslim refugees and 32 million Muslim deaths from violence (5 million) or
from hegemony- or war-imposed deprivation (27 million) since the US
Government’s 9-11 false –flag atrocity [7-9]].
   1. We have secured allies.  We’ve acted to protect the vulnerable.  We
   supported human rights and welcomed scrutiny of our own actions.  We’ve
   bound our power to international laws and institutions.  When we’ve made
   mistakes, we’ve tried to acknowledge them.  We have worked to roll back
   poverty and hunger and disease beyond our borders, not just within our
   borders.
[The US under Obama has backed military coups, been associated with
invasions of 20 countries, supported Apartheid and genocide in Palestine,
opposed nuclear disarmament, and grossly violated human rights  at home and
abroad. Under Obama the coal-to-gas conversion by the US under Obama locks
in disastrous long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution and hence climate
change inaction for decades [48, 49],   17 million people die avoidably
from deprivation each year, about half of them children [4], and 7 million
die from air pollution each year [5, 6]. The 3 key threats to humanity are
(a) nuclear weapons, (b) poverty and (c ) climate change but under Obama
(a) the US increased its nuclear threat, continued to back nuclear
terrorist Apartheid Israel and opposed the nuclear weapons ban advocated by
about 130 countries [14]; (b) the US supports poverty-entrenching
 dictatorships, and of about $40 billion in annual US economic plus
military  aid, about $10 billion is military aid (40% to Apartheid Israel)
 and most of the remainder is linked to destructive US military
intervention; and (c) the pro-gas US is one of the worlds worst countries
for  annual per capita GHG pollution in terms of tonnes CO2-equivalent per
person per year (41.0 for the US, 8.9 world average, China 7.4 and India
2.1) and for  “income weighted annual per capita GHG pollution (US 207,
China 5.2 and India 0.3) [35, 36]].
   1. I’m proud of that.  But I also know that we can’t do this alone.  And
   I believe that if we’re to meet the challenges of this century, we are all
   going to have to do more to build up international capacity.  We cannot
   escape the prospect of nuclear war unless we all commit to stopping the
   spread of nuclear weapons and pursuing a world without them.
[ While imposing deadly Sanctions on Iran (that has zero nuclear weapons
and  repeatedly states that it does not want nuclear weapons and wants a
nuclear weapons-free Middle East), the US (7,315 nuclear weapons) is
boosting its nuclear and conventional forces in Asia and Australia, opposes
a nuclear weapons ban,  and continues to pour billions of dollars of
military aid into the war criminal, genocidally racist, ethnic cleansing
and nuclear terrorist rogue state of Apartheid Israel that reportedly has
up to 400 nuclear weapons, this having been acquired with US collaboration.
.  The upper  estimates of stored  nuclear weapons  are as follows: US
(7,315), Russia (8,000), Apartheid Israel (400), France (300), UK (250),
China (250), Pakistan (120), India (100), and North Korea (less than 10)
[14, 34]].
   1. When Iran agrees to accept constraints on its nuclear program that
   enhances global security and enhances Iran’s ability to work with other
   nations.  On the other hand, when North Korea tests a bomb that endangers
   all of us.  And any country that breaks this basic bargain must face
   consequences.  And those nations with these weapons, like the United
   States, have a unique responsibility to pursue the path of reducing our
   stockpiles, and reaffirming basic norms like the commitment to never test
   them again.
[see  The US is a world leader in nuclear terrorism. Iran does not have
nuclear weapons. Obama does not mention Apartheid Israel’s 400 nuclear
weapons [14, 34]].
   1. We can’t combat a disease like Zika that recognizes no borders —
   mosquitos don’t respect walls — unless we make permanent the same urgency
   that we brought to bear against Ebola — by strengthening our own systems of
   public health, by investing in cures and rolling back the root causes of
   disease, and helping poorer countries develop a public health
   infrastructure.
[  The dominant neoliberal ideology  in the US has ensured that
pharmaceutical advance is geared to highly profitable medicines for “White
folks” who can afford to buy them  –  however, the Ebola scare illustrated
how quickly US Big Pharma and medical research can move when “White folks”
are threatened. The efficacy of tens of thousands of medicines have been
determined in exhaustive trials based on “White folks” but their efficacy
has not been determined, for example,  for genetically diverse populations
in Africa].
   1. We can only eliminate extreme poverty if the sustainable development
   goals that we have set are more than words on paper. Human ingenuity now
   gives us the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our children —
   including our girls — the education that is the foundation for opportunity
   in our world.  But we have to put our money where our mouths are.
*[In terms of net official development assistance as “a percentage of gross
national income in 2015”, Sweden ranks top among OECD countries with 1.4%
whereas the US ranks 20th at 0.17% [66]]. *
   1. And we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding —
   to replace the ravages of war with cooperation — if powerful nations like
   my own accept constraints.  Sometimes I’m criticized in my own country for
   professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions.
   But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action —
   not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core
   interests, but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term
   — enhances our security.  And I think that’s not just true for us.
[With breathtaking arrogance Obama is saying that some time in the distant
future the US  might give up “some freedom of action” but it is “not giving
up our ability  … [to] pursue our core interests” i.e. an exceptionalist
 US will continue to subvert, threaten, invade, and devastate other
countries that reached an historical high for America under Nobel Peace
Prize winner but serial invader and serial war criminal Obama].
   1. If Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it
   may be popular at home, it may fuel nationalist fervor for a time, but over
   time it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less
   secure.  In the South China Sea, a peaceful resolution of disputes offered
   by law will mean far greater stability than the militarization of a few
   rocks and reefs.
[Russia responded to the racist, anti-Russian neo-Nazi coup in Ukraine that
was engineered and backed by the North America-located US; the
re-incorporation of strategically vital Crimea into Russia was
overwhelmingly supported by the Crimean population. The South China Sea is
called such  because it is off the coast of South China and not off the
coast of the North America-located US;  under anti-Arab anti-Semitic and
Islamophobic warmonger Obama the  US Alliance headed by the North
America-located US invaded 20 impoverished and distant countries in
pursuance of the Zionist-backed US War on Muslims (War on Terror) that has
been associated with 30 million Muslim refugees and 32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from hegemony- or war-imposed
deprivation (27 million) since the US Government’s 9-11 false –flag
atrocity [7-9]].
   1. We are all stakeholders in this international system, and it calls
   upon all of us to invest in the success of institutions to which we
   belong.  And the good news is, is that many nations have shown what kind of
   progress is possible when we make those commitments.  Consider what we’ve
   accomplished here over the past few years.
[Obama is using weasel words “stakeholders in this international system”
and “invest in the success of institutions” – what the US under Obama
should have been doing was obeying international laws and conventions,
instead of grossly violating these international laws and conventions].
   1. Together, we mobilized some 50,000 additional troops for U.N.
   peacekeeping, making them nimble, better equipped, better prepared to deal
   with emergencies.  Together, we established an Open Government Partnership
   so that, increasingly, transparency empowers more and more people around
   the globe.  And together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to
   help refugees who are desperate for a home.
[“US peace-keeping” is an oxymoron as evidenced by the Zionist–backed US
War on Muslims (War on Terror, Muslim Holocaust, Muslim Genocide) that has
been associated with 30 million Muslim refugees and 32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from hegemony- or war-imposed
deprivation (27 million) since the US Government’s 9-11 false –flag
atrocity [7-9]].
   1. We should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have
   been made at this General Assembly gathering.  I’ll be discussing that more
   this afternoon.  But we have to follow through, even when the politics are
   hard.  Because in the eyes of innocent men and women and children who,
   through no fault of their own, have had to flee everything that they know,
   everything that they love, we have to have the empathy to see ourselves.
   We have to imagine what it would be like for our family, for our children,
   if the unspeakable happened to us.  And we should all understand that,
   ultimately, our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those
   in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to
   accommodating these refugees.
[ Syria was an oasis of peace and religious tolerance and hosted more
refugees per capita that any other country – and then the US and the US
Alliance intervened with bombing and supporting terrorists to remove the
secular Syrian Government, killing 0.5 million people, generating 12
million Syrian refugees, and destroying this ancient country [9]].
   1. There are a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing.
   But many nations — particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits
   of geography — that can do more to offer a hand, even if they also insist
   that refugees who come to our countries have to do more to adapt to the
   customs and conventions of the communities that are now providing them a
   home.
[More breathtaking Obama dishonesty and implicit racism and bigotry; see
 – in terms of net official development assistance as “a percentage of
gross national income in 2015”, Sweden ranks top among OECD countries with
1.4% whereas the US ranks 20th at 0.17% [66]].
   1. Let me conclude by saying that I recognize history tells a different
   story than the one that I’ve talked about here today.  There’s a much
   darker and more cynical view of history that we can adopt.  Human beings
   are too often motivated by greed and by power.  Big countries for most of
   history have pushed smaller ones around.  Tribes and ethnic groups and
   nation states have very often found it most convenient to define themselves
   by what they hate and not just those ideas that bind them together.
[Obama actually tells the truth for once in admitting  his gross mendacity
and saying that “I recognize history tells a different story than the one
that I’ve talked about here today” [4]].
   1. Time and again, human beings have believed that they finally arrived
   at a period of enlightenment only to repeat, then, cycles of conflict and
   suffering.  Perhaps that’s our fate.  We have to remember that the choices
   of individual human beings led to repeated world war.  But we also have to
   remember that the choices of individual human beings created a United
   Nations, so that a war like that would never happen again.  Each of us as
   leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst
   impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best.  For we have shown that
   we can choose a better history.
[The UN was created to prevent  wars like WW2 that was associated with
violent deaths and avoidable deaths from deprivation totalling over 100
million. However US exceptionalism has meant that post-1950 US Asian wars
 have been associated with 40 million Asian deaths from violence or
war-imposed deprivation;1950-2005 avoidable deaths from deprivation in
countries occupied by the US in the post-1945 era have totalled 82 million
[4]; Muslim deaths from violence or imposed deprivation have totalled 32
million since 9-11, with Obama being directly involved in much of this
carnage; there are presently 65 million refugees in the world  of whom 30
million are Muslim refugees generated by a   genocidally  racist US or by
US-backed and genocidally racist Apartheid Israel [9]].
   1. Sitting in a prison cell, a young Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote that,
   “Human progress never rolls on the wheels of inevitability; it comes
   through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God.”
   And during the course of these eight years, as I’ve traveled to many of
   your nations, I have seen that spirit in our young people, who are more
   educated and more tolerant, and more inclusive and more diverse, and more
   creative than our generation; who are more empathetic and compassionate
   towards their fellow human beings than previous generations.  And, yes,
   some of that comes with the idealism of youth.  But it also comes with
   young people’s access to information about other peoples and places — an
   understanding unique in human history that their future is bound with the
   fates of other human beings on the other side of the world.
[Mass murderer, serial invader, serial war criminal and genocidal racist
Obama and his similarly  degenerate and   Zionist-perverted allies can
hardly be called “co-workers with God”].
   1. I think of the thousands of health care workers from around the world
   who volunteered to fight Ebola.  I remember the young entrepreneurs I met
   who are now starting new businesses in Cuba, the parliamentarians who used
   to be just a few years ago political prisoners in Myanmar.  I think of the
   girls who have braved taunts or violence just to go to school in
   Afghanistan, and the university students who started programs online to
   reject the extremism of organizations like ISIL.  I draw strength from the
   young Americans — entrepreneurs, activists, soldiers, new citizens — who
   are remaking our nation once again, who are unconstrained by old habits and
   old conventions, and unencumbered by what is, but are instead ready to
   seize what ought to be.
[How disgusting  that racist mass murderer Obama links himself to
courageous young humanitarians].
   1. My own family is a made up of the flesh and blood and traditions and
   cultures and faiths from a lot of different parts of the world — just as
   America has been built by immigrants from every shore.  And in my own life,
   in this country, and as President, I have learned that our identities do
   not have to be defined by putting someone else down, but can be enhanced by
   lifting somebody else up.  They don’t have to be defined in opposition to
   others, but rather by a belief in liberty and equality and justice and
   fairness.
[When truthful history is written, Obama will be defined by his
participation in the post-9-11 Muslim Holocaust and Muslim Genocide
associated with 30 million Muslim refugees and 32 million Muslim deaths
from violence – or from war - and hegemony-imposed deprivation [9]].
   1. And the embrace of these principles as universal doesn’t weaken my
   particular pride, my particular love for America — it strengthens it.  My
   belief that these ideals apply everywhere doesn’t lessen my commitment to
   help those who look like me, or pray as I do, or pledge allegiance to my
   flag.  But my faith in those principles does force me to expand my moral
   imagination and to recognize that I can best serve my own people, I can
   best look after my own daughters, by making sure that my actions seek what
   is right for all people and all children, and your daughters and your sons
[Gross hypocrisy by Obama  who is currently the world’s number 1
pathological liar, serial invader, warmonger, war criminal, child killer,
climate criminal,  and drug pusher. It is notable that Obama did not
mention illicit drugs in his speech. Also utterly ignored by Neocon
American and Zionist  Imperialist (NAZI)-perverted and subverted Western
Mainstream media are the 1.2 million people who have died world-wide since
9-11 due to US Alliance restoration of the Taliban-destroyed Afghan opium
industry from 6% of world market share in 2001 to 93% in 2007, the
breakdown (as of 2015)  including 280,000 Americans, 256,000 Indonesians,
68,000 Iranians, 25,000 British, 14,000 Canadians, 10,000 Germans, and
5,000 Australians [12]].
   1. This is what I believe:  that all of us can be co-workers with God.
   And our leadership, and our governments, and this United Nations should
   reflect this irreducible truth.
[This is what Obama blasphemously calls being “co-workers with God”: the
atmospheric CO2 concentration has increased to 405 ppm CO2 and is
increasing at a record 3 ppm CO2 per year; a catastrophic plus 2C
temperature rise is now unavoidable and the current plus 1C is already
catastrophic for tropical Island States and megadelta countries like
Bangladesh;  the plus 1.5C target may well be exceeded by 2020; the
coal-to-gas conversion by the US under Obama locks in disastrous long-term
greenhouse gas (GHG) pollution; 17 million people die avoidably each year;
7 million die from air pollution each year; the US Alliance has invaded 20
overwhelmingly or significantly Muslim countries since  the US Government’s
9-11 false flag atrocity, this being associated with 32 million Muslim
deaths from violence (5 million) or from war- or hegemony-imposed
deprivation (27 million) [2, 4, 9, 67]. Of course the bottom line in any
human society  is respect for children but Obama has an appalling record
 of child killing. During the Vietnam War, decent people chanted “Hey, hey,
USA, how many kids did you kill today?” In May 2009  I catalogued  the
answer for America under Obama as 1,000 [68]].
   1. Thank you very much.  (Applause)
[Genuine gratitude one supposes by Obama who is currently the world’s
number 1 pathological liar, serial invader, warmonger, war criminal, child
killer, climate criminal,  and drug pusher but is free to operate as the
world’s current number 1 serial killer for another 3 months. Obama is
lauded as America’s first Black president but is complicit in the Muslim
Holocaust and Muslim Genocide that has taken 32 million non-European Muslim
lives  since the US Government’s 9-11 false-flag atrocity killed 3,000
people in 2001].
*Conclusions. *
Serial war criminal Barack Obama must be arraigned before the International
Criminal Court.  There  must be Boycotts, Divestment and Sanction (BDS)
against the United States and its war criminal allies until their  crimes
are recognized and punished and America and its allies undergo
 de-Nazification. The relatives, friends and fellow citizens of the 1.7
million Americans who die preventably each year must disempower the Neocon
American and Zionist  Imperialists (NAZIs) who have subverted and perverted
America and crippled America with the $40 trillion long-term accrual cost
of nuclear terrorist Apartheid Israel and attendant wars.
In 2005 Literature Nobel Laureate,  anti-racist Jewish British playwright
Harold Pinter declared that  Bush and Blair should be arraigned before the
International Criminal Court: “We have brought torture, cluster bombs,
depleted uranium, innumerable acts of random murder, misery, degradation
and death to the Iraqi people and call it “bringing freedom and democracy
to the Middle East”. How many people do you have to kill before you qualify
to be described as a mass murderer and a war criminal? One hundred
thousand? More than enough, I would have thought” [69]. 32 million? More
than enough I would have thought.

Hash: SHA512
The Dawn of the Crypto Age
by CANNON C. , in the year 2015
- -An essay on how crypto technologies will shape our world, and why these
technologies are often met with government opposition-
 Throughout all of the chapters of history, civilization struggles in a
constant battle between liberty and tyranny, progression and corruption.
For the world is plentiful in numerous points of its history of a populace
oppressed by governments. Like a beast untamed or loosened, or a fire
fueled and spread, it is the natural tendencies of governments to become
corrupt and to perpetually expand and maintain power. This is not because
government in itself is corrupt, but rather because mankind is corrupt
through greed, in the pursuit of wealth and power at the expense of a
nation while utilizing the powerful body of government as their tool.
Government makes a handsome target of exploitation to the corrupt and
enemies of liberty due to the centralization of power that governments
wield and the position of the tool of government being in the high layer of
power, known as the political realm.
 Until now, the balance of power sat in the hands of governments who have
gone rogue at the conduction of usurpers and tyrants and have been used to
empower themselves while oppressing the populace and liberty, whether
openly or covertly. However, in the modern age, in this dawn of the crypto
revolution which follows the still advancing and parallel technological
revolution, the balance of power in the world is shifting from that of
governments and usurpers to the people.
 Throughout history, humankind has been through various golden ages of
enlightenment, and of technological advancements and progressions. It is
this evolution in the advancement of humankind which has altered the
foundation for which future technology and the direction of civilization is
based. We have had the Age of Enlightenment, the scientific revolution, the
Renaissance, the Industrial Revolution, and the technological/informational
revolution, to name a few. And now, even when the latter is still young, we
enter another age that parallels it: the dawn of the crypto revolution,
which is based upon the infrastructure of the current
technological/informational revolution.
 The context of the word "revolution" in the case of this writing refers to
that of sudden change in the world brought about by advancements in
technologies and discoveries, while "crypto" or "cryptographic" is
referring to the use of encryption (codes) paired with technology to create
systems immune to espionage, control, and takedown by an enemy.
 The newly emerging technology brought about by the crypto revolution is
built on our current technological infrastructure. The advent of our
current computerized cyber-infrastructure makes an easy way to build, host,
and deploy decentralized protocols. It is also cyberspace that connects us
all and breeds innovation through uncensored and decentralized
communications such as the Internet, hence why the crypto revolution began
shortly after the birth of the technological revolution. This new
technology will secure itself and also secure society from the current
flaws in our informational technology infrastructure which that same
society has come to rely upon.
 The crypto revolution will alter the shape of the workings of civilization
in positive ways to advance us towards a more perfect civilization, just as
the technological revolution altered the way we communicate, do business,
interact, etc. And just as how the industrial revolution altered the way we
travel, manufacture, and live, to too shall the crypto revolution shape our
world. This time, this era in human progression will impact the workings of
the economy, politics, banking, governments... all in a way that will make
the workings of the pre-crypto age antiquated and perhaps even scoffed at
by future generations.
 Just as the crypto revolution is based on the technological revolution
which was based on the industrial revolution, so too shall some other
future progressions be based on the crypto revolution. These future
progressions as a result of the crypto revolution I foresee being comprised
of political, economic, and social advancements.
 Although progressions in the advancement of civilization are often
beneficial to the human race, advancement is sometimes met with opposition
by the existing power structure. This opposition by the minority who wield
power over the rest is due to the threat this new technology/discovery
presents to their power. Opposition can also often be due to lack of
understanding of the new technology.
 The future of technology I am describing can be referred to as
decentralized cryptographic protocols - secure, open source, self
regulating, decentralized, cryptographic protocols, to be more descriptive.
For the new way will be a better way, a way void of the major flaws and
imperfection of the former which have empowered the corrupt and created
insecure systems causing results which have haunted our society. These
newly emerging technologies will repair the security flaws which came about
by having a society that became reliant upon informational technology. The
root of many of the current security flaws in our world come from the
exploitation of vulnerabilities that are a result of the lack of the
following three items, which I refer to together as the triangle of
Integrity, Availability, and Confidentiality

*Diary of a Person of Interest*
As for-profit, private sector, sub-contracted “Asset Tracking” (an
Orwellian term that masks it’s true meaning – Spying On You) and related
“investigatory” companies are being brought to light in the mainstream, it
seems useful to share some insight into a day in the life of a subject of
such unsavoury attention.
For no longer is the subject of state surveillance the traditional
‘criminal’ stereotype – but in fact regular people. The Persons of Interest
are anyone with any access to any kind of information that is of even the
vaguest interest to anyone with access to the apparently monolithic state
spying apparatus.
Add in two degrees of separation
 to the “Asset Tracking” –
ie., everyone the Person knows and everyone that *they* know for good
measure, and you have everyone from suburban mothers to doctors to
fishermen to airhostesses to school Principals getting followed around and
having their communications pried into by total strangers.
While it is indeed an issue of immoral and intrusive surveillance, there is
more to it.  Once targeted by the state, there is an all encompassing
psychological warfare as you are systematically conditioned to having the
most intimate parts of your life laid open to all and sundry, for them to
manipulate and, in some cases, profit from.
No act can be undertaken naturally – from the most banal decisions made in
the bathroom to any attempt to have a relationship with another person. The
more you are psychologically poked and prodded, the more you are forced to
sidestep entrapment efforts, the more exacerbated your mental isolation,
living in a world where the only person you can truly rely upon is yourself.
Decisions you make have complex and far-reaching consequences, not just for
yourself but for the numerous people who knowingly or unknowingly will be
affected by any choice you do make, and you live with the constant guilt of
the ways in which you are affecting other people’s lives without ever
intending to.
Some have described being the victim of such comprehensive intrusion and
manipulation as ‘torture’ and suggested it is an issue for the U.N. to
I don’t personally feel qualified to make such a claim because being inside
of it makes it impossible to have the level of detachment required to
reduce it to a single blanket statement.
However I do innately know that the following daily thought processes are
completely tragic and unnatural, and that humankind cannot continue like
Without further adieu: The Diary of a Person of Interest
4.30am – 6.30am: this is the worst time of the day. The entire
neighbourhood is asleep but your neighbour’s dogs bark incessantly and you
get to listen to the sounds of garage doors scraping and cars that
shouldn’t be going anywhere at that time going nonetheless. It pays to be
asleep between these hours.
7.30am:  Awake on the couch where you slept fully clothed so that there
wouldn’t be more footage of you walking around your house naked.  The
morning, which is structured around beautiful, happy and mostly oblivious
children, is the easiest time to forget that you have not enjoyed any
domestic privacy for nearly three years. The shrieks to get up, eat
breakfast and hurry off out the door are normal morning sounds and familiar
to the point of comfortable.
8.30am:  It  is time to go and you grab your keys, already looking at the
cul de sac for the car that will leave ahead of you, and then the other car
which will return behind you again after you have dropped the children at
school.  These cars, and many more, have been trailing you for years now
and were a source of great mystery prior to seeing the documentary ‘Operation
8 ‘ on NZ on Screen and
finally clicking as to what was taking place.  Funnily enough, back at the
beginning, when you were put in the hotseat via Skype to answer 10 fast
questions from a total stranger, one of them was whether you knew any of
the Urewera 4 .
You didn’t.  You had never been an activist or an organiser or an
independent journalist nor had any idea the surveillance state existed let
alone that you’d one day be targeted by it.  Now, after three years of its
unwelcome, immoral attentions, you not only know some of them but are
represented by their lawyer. In a funny way the persecution and oppression
heaped upon you drive you to the very places the state claims to not want
you to go, and results in the very friendships being established that they
ostensibly don’t want you to have.
9.30am:  one of your oldest and best friends in the world has messaged you
on Facebook. She misses you and wants to chat.  You’ve known her since you
were in your early teens and always had a heartfelt connection  to her. She
is one of the best people you know. But you are scared to respond to her
because her husband (who she married many years later) works for the US
military. Your very friendship, which you have cherished so much, is now a
potential danger to her and also to yourself. What will your activist and
media friends and colleagues think of you being friends with someone
connected to the military industrial complex? What will your friend and her
husband’s facebook friends think of them being connected to a new media
activist? Will they and everyone they know end up being spied on just
because you and she infrequently profess your love and gratitude for each
other’s existence? Is that grounds alone for equal intrusions upon her
life, the very fact of the connection? Will your government decide that you
must be a U.S.  plant because one of your best friends is American? Will
they trawl back through your completely innocuous past travels and decide
that there must be more to it than you doing your O.E.
?  The questions and
implications are endless, and all because she loves you and wants to say
10.30am: you are procrastinating now because you don’t want to do what you
should be doing. Crafting business plans for new ventures is no fun when
your intellectual property will be read and studied by your government and
perhaps others, long before you’ve even had a chance to submit it to the
rest of your team members. The complete absence of secure, private
communications has consistently led to your ideas and work being stolen for
the profit of others, and you are not eager to repeat the experience.
Building and creating something when others already have the blueprints is
a virtually impossible  endeavour. Any alliances you form or opportunities
you pursue will be interfered with, be it before during or after your
undertaking. Anything of value will be extracted and siphoned off and you
just don’t have the energy to try to convince others who are understandably
reluctant, of what is possible. While encryption offers some measure of
hope in terms of whittling down the number of people with the capacity to
penetrate the communications, the cold harsh reality of any hardware you
ever own being physically compromised plus the constant monitoring and
piggy-backing of all your digital work means that innovation can come only
in short bursts and in open source environments with an equal level playing
field. Peer to peer is no longer desirable when it is is peer to peer with
a man in the middle. Has to be all or nothing and you are relatively
content with little to nothing and thus accept the stifling of your full
11.30am:  As do many, you both relish and dread social media. As amazing a
tool for social change as it has been –  as responsible for many of your
successes as it has been – it’s true owners have been increasingly
asserting their control over it to the extent that nothing can be taken at
face value. Strange and beautiful messages intertwine and you are never
sure of the true source. Nasty, acerbic regurgitated commentary of your
daily struggles appears, alongside gloating or self-important, stuffy
rhetoric letting slip key intimacies gained from covertly obtained
knowledge of your physical environment and admonishing you. Occasionally,
there are outright death threats. The macabre and the vicarious combine and
the overall feeling is one of dirtiness, the slime of the negative energy.
There are fragments of light but fewer and so distant the sparkle is like a
mirage. When everything you see through a screen is malleable –
transferable, delayable, manipulable –  nothing can be certain, neither the
light nor the dark or whether they in fact come from the same source.
Messages sent are not necessarily messages received and as the manipulation
of your reality is total very little, if anything, can be taken for
granted; certainly not at face value.  Your entire online experience is
tailored and not just for advertising purposes. Your life defined by
algorithms that are constantly evolving, by means outside your reach and to
ends other than your own. Your every online second is now an opportunity to
be misconstrued, to be entrapped, to be monitored. The desire to exercise
the human right to communication is now a liability rather than a privilege.
12.30pm: You are hungry but you are just thinking about love again.
Day-dreaming. Pining.  Love moves you. This has long been determined and is
the pinnacle of your psychological profile.  The only thing they have found
that is guaranteed to make you act is love. For your thoughts are not
merely enough. The leeching of your ideas just a value-add to the targeting
of you. The real intention is to make you act. To trigger you, provoke you,
guide you in the direction they want you to go.  For they cannot prosecute
a thought – they cannot prosecute a speech. But they can prosecute an act.
Where they have forced others to act to their own detriment, the punishment
has been swift. Where they have not been able to, the ‘torture’ is
prolonged. The surveillance spans years. Way back at the beginning you
naievely thought all of this would end up on record. That it was being
collected for the purposes of a judge and a jury. As the months under
investigation became years, you finally realised – noone is going to give
this footage to a judge. Noone is going to film you in your bathroom and
then put that on a court record. The vast majority of the surveillance is
not collected on the behalf of a court, it is collected for the sole
benefit of the financier – whether that be a private funder or the state.
These countless intrusions are not for an investigation at all. They are
for a very specific set of reasons and it seems, may well now span the
entire remainder of your life. Your motivations, once gleaned, are
monopolised upon.  Your desires are pinpointed and then tantalisingly
dangled in front of you – the proverbial carrot. The deal with the devil is
to get what you want by giving him what he wants and then hoping he doesn’t
reneg on the bargain after the fact. It is a dangerous game, a slippery
slope. Your innocent dreams of love and companionship are the weakness by
which you are routinely attacked and there are seemingly no limits to what
can be done to influence and ultimately control your romantic situation.
For the watchers do not just watch – they insert themselves into your life
in as many capacities as possible, be it work or social, familial or via
acquaintances and friends of friends. They will hit on you in a bar; they
will befriend your friends under false pretences, for the sole motivation
of getting close enough to you to gain influence or insight. They are Rob
Gilchrist. They are Sabu. They will impersonate people you have known for
nearly a decade, and with great dedication and preparation, lull you into a
false sense of security so that you come to value a relationship which does
not exist.  Why? So that you will act, and so that they can capture that
act, and then wield it against you. Even if it is an act of love, an
intimacy, that exists only as a fruit of their deception and manipulation.
They falsely believe recording such acts empowers them. In fact, they are
holding the evidence of their own despicable natures and dastardly
undertakings, in their own hands. What they feel is their victory, in fact
exposes them, and not you. This is a valuable insight and you soon learn to
own the mistakes, the humiliations, while leaving the shame of them to the
perpetrators; the tarnish where it belongs.
1.30pm: Done with psychoanalysing and re-psychoanalyzing every potentiality
and its outcome, there is little more than an hour left to do anything
worthwhile.  Thus the mundane and safe becomes a warm and pleasant coccoon.
The actions for which you need not be concerned by hidden strings pulling,
manipulated by the hands of hidden puppetmasters. Dishes become a
pleasure.  Vaccuuming, a release. You dare not check the mail – you have
long since lost interest in it as it so often failed to arrive at all and
when it did, looked like mice had been eating the corners.  You try to have
everything redirected just so that you no longer have to be confronted with
the cold reality of the intrusions. Harder to escape the physical
intrusions. From the first burglary where nothing was stolen and your
bathroom window was smashed on the inside, to the little holes that appear
in your newly-refinished ceiling. The drill marks in the doorways. The
cracks in the top corners of mirrors, of photo-frames.  The worn lining in
the tops of the doors of your near-new car.  The underwear drawer full of
underwear torn to the hip. The precious watch from your grandmother; an
heirloom, smashed, with its face missing. The brand new 4-pack of socks on
top of your dresser that disappears while you are out, with only a dirty
pair of used men’s socks left in its place. The roof patch that is removed
as soon as the workmen replace it there. The car tyres that somehow
periodically get road spikes embedded in them.  The oil cap that
conveniently disappears into thin air. Yes, it is not just the
surveillance, it is the holistic sabotage, the psychological warfare, that
is the true burden of the Person of Interest.
3:00pm: Briefly life returns to the normal chaos of excitable children and
domestic routine.  Wondering what to have for dinner brings its own welcome
respite, as does visits and extra-curricular activities. You become
grateful for the most mundane mechanics of the suburban Matrix, which now
seem a luxury. Although you are well-aware you are already in a jail cell
and have been for years – albeit a more nicely appointed jail cell than the
traditional idea of one – any lapse in external interference is gratefully
received, with the relief of a dog that has ceased being whipped, even if
only momentarily.
5.30pm: You are long since accustomed to the strange, uncomfortable or
vacant looks of those who once held you in normal regard. Well aware that
part of the attack on your character and person is for others to spread
gossip and rumours, or approach those on the periphery and encourage them
to turn their scorn upon you for whatever reason, be it real or
manufactured. You are used to not being able to answer the most basic
questions; of never really knowing what does or doesn’t have hidden
meaning, or in what way you will be judged for your honesty. The most
perfunctory answers and social norms seem inherently dishonest. The urge,
the driving force to state things as they are under any cirumstance, always
balanced against perceived self-interest, out of sheer necessity. For if
you do not watch your own back, who will? Who better than you understands
what you are going through?
8.00pm: Thanks to immoral legislation and the ambivalence of the state
towards the individual privacies of Persons of Interest, strangers will
watch you read to your children tonight. Just as they watched you play the
piano, reviewed what songs you looked at on You Tube and scoffed as you
chased a mouse around the kitchen, trying to humanely catch it. Your family
time is undertaken in the manner of The Truman Show – centerpieces to the
analysis and amusement of others.  Those who fashion themselves Gods but
are not worthy of the title.  Once all is again quiet, you will relegate
yourself back to the couch and wonder to whom you can reach out – to whom
your silent pleas will be answered. By your friends? By your enemies? Or
are they one and the same? Too many times you have been made promises, too
many times you have made promises and been prevented from keeping them. The
great spiral of the unknown makes you aware that the tiny fragments you do
know and can hold on to are such insignificant pieces of the puzzle that
you are prevented from ever truly being the architect of your own destiny.
Instead you must rock, roll, tumble with the blows, take them as they come,
and find solitude and safety only in your dreams.

While it is indeed an issue of immoral and intrusive surveillance, there is
more to it.  Once targeted by the state, there is an all encompassing
psychological warfare as you are systematically conditioned to having the
most intimate parts of your life laid open to all and sundry, for them to
manipulate and, in some cases, profit from.
No act can be undertaken naturally – from the most banal decisions made in
the bathroom to any attempt to have a relationship with another person. The
more you are psychologically poked and prodded, the more you are forced to
sidestep entrapment efforts, the more exacerbated your mental isolation,
living in a world where the only person you can truly rely upon is yourself.
Decisions you make have complex and far-reaching consequences, not just for
yourself but for the numerous people who knowingly or unknowingly will be
affected by any choice you do make, and you live with the constant guilt of
the ways in which you are affecting other people’s lives without ever
intending to.
Some have described being the victim of such comprehensive intrusion and
manipulation as ‘torture’ and suggested it is an issue for the U.N. to
I don’t personally feel qualified to make such a claim because being inside
of it makes it impossible to have the level of detachment required to
reduce it to a single blanket statement.
However I do innately know that the following daily thought processes are
completely tragic and unnatural, and that humankind cannot continue like
Without further adieu: The Diary of a Person of Interest
4.30am – 6.30am: this is the worst time of the day. The entire
neighbourhood is asleep but your neighbour’s dogs bark incessantly and you
get to listen to the sounds of garage doors scraping and cars that
shouldn’t be going anywhere at that time going nonetheless. It pays to be
asleep between these hours.
7.30am:  Awake on the couch where you slept fully clothed so that there
wouldn’t be more footage of you walking around your house naked.  The
morning, which is structured around beautiful, happy and mostly oblivious
children, is the easiest time to forget that you have not enjoyed any
domestic privacy for nearly three years. The shrieks to get up, eat
breakfast and hurry off out the door are normal morning sounds and familiar
to the point of comfortable.
8.30am:  It  is time to go and you grab your keys, already looking at the
cul de sac for the car that will leave ahead of you, and then the other car
which will return behind you again after you have dropped the children at
school.  These cars, and many more, have been trailing you for years now
and were a source of great mystery prior to seeing the documentary ‘Operation
8 ‘ on NZ on Screen and
finally clicking as to what was taking place.  Funnily enough, back at the
beginning, when you were put in the hotseat via Skype to answer 10 fast
questions from a total stranger, one of them was whether you knew any of
the Urewera 4 .
You didn’t.  You had never been an activist or an organiser or an
independent journalist nor had any idea the surveillance state existed let
alone that you’d one day be targeted by it.  Now, after three years of its
unwelcome, immoral attentions, you not only know some of them but are
represented by their lawyer. In a funny way the persecution and oppression
heaped upon you drive you to the very places the state claims to not want
you to go, and results in the very friendships being established that they
ostensibly don’t want you to have.
9.30am:  one of your oldest and best friends in the world has messaged you
on Facebook. She misses you and wants to chat.  You’ve known her since you
were in your early teens and always had a heartfelt connection  to her. She
is one of the best people you know. But you are scared to respond to her
because her husband (who she married many years later) works for the US
military. Your very friendship, which you have cherished so much, is now a
potential danger to her and also to yourself. What will your activist and
media friends and colleagues think of you being friends with someone
connected to the military industrial complex? What will your friend and her
husband’s facebook friends think of them being connected to a new media
activist? Will they and everyone they know end up being spied on just
because you and she infrequently profess your love and gratitude for each
other’s existence? Is that grounds alone for equal intrusions upon her
life, the very fact of the connection? Will your government decide that you
must be a U.S.  plant because one of your best friends is American? Will
they trawl back through your completely innocuous past travels and decide
that there must be more to it than you doing your O.E.
?  The questions and
implications are endless, and all because she loves you and wants to say
10.30am: you are procrastinating now because you don’t want to do what you
should be doing. Crafting business plans for new ventures is no fun when
your intellectual property will be read and studied by your government and
perhaps others, long before you’ve even had a chance to submit it to the
rest of your team members. The complete absence of secure, private
communications has consistently led to your ideas and work being stolen for
the profit of others, and you are not eager to repeat the experience.
Building and creating something when others already have the blueprints is
a virtually impossible  endeavour. Any alliances you form or opportunities
you pursue will be interfered with, be it before during or after your
undertaking. Anything of value will be extracted and siphoned off and you
just don’t have the energy to try to convince others who are understandably
reluctant, of what is possible. While encryption offers some measure of
hope in terms of whittling down the number of people with the capacity to
penetrate the communications, the cold harsh reality of any hardware you
ever own being physically compromised plus the constant monitoring and
piggy-backing of all your digital work means that innovation can come only
in short bursts and in open source environments with an equal level playing
field. Peer to peer is no longer desirable when it is is peer to peer with
a man in the middle. Has to be all or nothing and you are relatively
content with little to nothing and thus accept the stifling of your full
11.30am:  As do many, you both relish and dread social media. As amazing a
tool for social change as it has been –  as responsible for many of your
successes as it has been – it’s true owners have been increasingly
asserting their control over it to the extent that nothing can be taken at
face value. Strange and beautiful messages intertwine and you are never
sure of the true source. Nasty, acerbic regurgitated commentary of your
daily struggles appears, alongside gloating or self-important, stuffy
rhetoric letting slip key intimacies gained from covertly obtained
knowledge of your physical environment and admonishing you. Occasionally,
there are outright death threats. The macabre and the vicarious combine and
the overall feeling is one of dirtiness, the slime of the negative energy.
There are fragments of light but fewer and so distant the sparkle is like a
mirage. When everything you see through a screen is malleable –
transferable, delayable, manipulable –  nothing can be certain, neither the
light nor the dark or whether they in fact come from the same source.
Messages sent are not necessarily messages received and as the manipulation
of your reality is total very little, if anything, can be taken for
granted; certainly not at face value.  Your entire online experience is
tailored and not just for advertising purposes. Your life defined by
algorithms that are constantly evolving, by means outside your reach and to
ends other than your own. Your every online second is now an opportunity to
be misconstrued, to be entrapped, to be monitored. The desire to exercise
the human right to communication is now a liability rather than a privilege.
12.30pm: You are hungry but you are just thinking about love again.
Day-dreaming. Pining.  Love moves you. This has long been determined and is
the pinnacle of your psychological profile.  The only thing they have found
that is guaranteed to make you act is love. For your thoughts are not
merely enough. The leeching of your ideas just a value-add to the targeting
of you. The real intention is to make you act. To trigger you, provoke you,
guide you in the direction they want you to go.  For they cannot prosecute
a thought – they cannot prosecute a speech. But they can prosecute an act.
Where they have forced others to act to their own detriment, the punishment
has been swift. Where they have not been able to, the ‘torture’ is
prolonged. The surveillance spans years. Way back at the beginning you
naievely thought all of this would end up on record. That it was being
collected for the purposes of a judge and a jury. As the months under
investigation became years, you finally realised – noone is going to give
this footage to a judge. Noone is going to film you in your bathroom and
then put that on a court record. The vast majority of the surveillance is
not collected on the behalf of a court, it is collected for the sole
benefit of the financier – whether that be a private funder or the state.
These countless intrusions are not for an investigation at all. They are
for a very specific set of reasons and it seems, may well now span the
entire remainder of your life. Your motivations, once gleaned, are
monopolised upon.  Your desires are pinpointed and then tantalisingly
dangled in front of you – the proverbial carrot. The deal with the devil is
to get what you want by giving him what he wants and then hoping he doesn’t
reneg on the bargain after the fact. It is a dangerous game, a slippery
slope. Your innocent dreams of love and companionship are the weakness by
which you are routinely attacked and there are seemingly no limits to what
can be done to influence and ultimately control your romantic situation.
For the watchers do not just watch – they insert themselves into your life
in as many capacities as possible, be it work or social, familial or via
acquaintances and friends of friends. They will hit on you in a bar; they
will befriend your friends under false pretences, for the sole motivation
of getting close enough to you to gain influence or insight. They are Rob
Gilchrist. They are Sabu. They will impersonate people you have known for
nearly a decade, and with great dedication and preparation, lull you into a
false sense of security so that you come to value a relationship which does
not exist.  Why? So that you will act, and so that they can capture that
act, and then wield it against you. Even if it is an act of love, an
intimacy, that exists only as a fruit of their deception and manipulation.
They falsely believe recording such acts empowers them. In fact, they are
holding the evidence of their own despicable natures and dastardly
undertakings, in their own hands. What they feel is their victory, in fact
exposes them, and not you. This is a valuable insight and you soon learn to
own the mistakes, the humiliations, while leaving the shame of them to the
perpetrators; the tarnish where it belongs.
1.30pm: Done with psychoanalysing and re-psychoanalyzing every potentiality
and its outcome, there is little more than an hour left to do anything
worthwhile.  Thus the mundane and safe becomes a warm and pleasant coccoon.
The actions for which you need not be concerned by hidden strings pulling,
manipulated by the hands of hidden puppetmasters. Dishes become a
pleasure.  Vaccuuming, a release. You dare not check the mail – you have
long since lost interest in it as it so often failed to arrive at all and
when it did, looked like mice had been eating the corners.  You try to have
everything redirected just so that you no longer have to be confronted with
the cold reality of the intrusions. Harder to escape the physical
intrusions. From the first burglary where nothing was stolen and your
bathroom window was smashed on the inside, to the little holes that appear
in your newly-refinished ceiling. The drill marks in the doorways. The
cracks in the top corners of mirrors, of photo-frames.  The worn lining in
the tops of the doors of your near-new car.  The underwear drawer full of
underwear torn to the hip. The precious watch from your grandmother; an
heirloom, smashed, with its face missing. The brand new 4-pack of socks on
top of your dresser that disappears while you are out, with only a dirty
pair of used men’s socks left in its place. The roof patch that is removed
as soon as the workmen replace it there. The car tyres that somehow
periodically get road spikes embedded in them.  The oil cap that
conveniently disappears into thin air. Yes, it is not just the
surveillance, it is the holistic sabotage, the psychological warfare, that
is the true burden of the Person of Interest.
3:00pm: Briefly life returns to the normal chaos of excitable children and
domestic routine.  Wondering what to have for dinner brings its own welcome
respite, as does visits and extra-curricular activities. You become
grateful for the most mundane mechanics of the suburban Matrix, which now
seem a luxury. Although you are well-aware you are already in a jail cell
and have been for years – albeit a more nicely appointed jail cell than the
traditional idea of one – any lapse in external interference is gratefully
received, with the relief of a dog that has ceased being whipped, even if
only momentarily.
5.30pm: You are long since accustomed to the strange, uncomfortable or
vacant looks of those who once held you in normal regard. Well aware that
part of the attack on your character and person is for others to spread
gossip and rumours, or approach those on the periphery and encourage them
to turn their scorn upon you for whatever reason, be it real or
manufactured. You are used to not being able to answer the most basic
questions; of never really knowing what does or doesn’t have hidden
meaning, or in what way you will be judged for your honesty. The most
perfunctory answers and social norms seem inherently dishonest. The urge,
the driving force to state things as they are under any cirumstance, always
balanced against perceived self-interest, out of sheer necessity. For if
you do not watch your own back, who will? Who better than you understands
what you are going through?
8.00pm: Thanks to immoral legislation and the ambivalence of the state
towards the individual privacies of Persons of Interest, strangers will
watch you read to your children tonight. Just as they watched you play the
piano, reviewed what songs you looked at on You Tube and scoffed as you
chased a mouse around the kitchen, trying to humanely catch it. Your family
time is undertaken in the manner of The Truman Show – centerpieces to the
analysis and amusement of others.  Those who fashion themselves Gods but
are not worthy of the title.  Once all is again quiet, you will relegate
yourself back to the couch and wonder to whom you can reach out – to whom
your silent pleas will be answered. By your friends? By your enemies? Or
are they one and the same? Too many times you have been made promises, too
many times you have made promises and been prevented from keeping them. The
great spiral of the unknown makes you aware that the tiny fragments you do
know and can hold on to are such insignificant pieces of the puzzle that
you are prevented from ever truly being the architect of your own destiny.
Instead you must rock, roll, tumble with the blows, take them as they come,
and find solitude and safety only in your dreams.

An Open Letter to The New York Times
December 17, 2016
Dear *The New York Times* newsroom and information security staff,
On December 15, 2016, nytimes.com published a new tips page
 that offers
individuals who want to blow the whistle on newsworthy issues ways to do so
without risking their security and privacy. There is no question that this
commendable decision, taken by a newspaper of record, is a significant
asset towards a more effective free press.
*The New York Times* makes itself available to tipsters via cutting-edge
privacy technologies such as *SecureDrop*  and
*Signal* . *SecureDrop* has been deployed in
many of the world's most important newsrooms and has almost certainly aided
in the publication of the most ethically significant leaks of this decade.
*Signal*'s parent company, *Open Whisper Systems*, has indirectly allowed
more than a billion people access to indisputably strong encryption.
Cryptocat's own development was strongly influenced, and has influenced,
these tools: we adopted a variant of *Signal*'s encryption protocol in
March 2016, which was clearly superior to our own, and our early research
on client-side web encryption in 2011 set the stage for *SecureDrop* and
*Mailvelope* (another recommended tool) to follow in using similar
engineering fundamentals, oftentimes by learning through our own early
engineering mistakes and thereby avoiding them.
Cryptocat was also funded by the same primary backer as *SecureDrop*,
*Signal* and *Mailvelope*: the *Open Technology Fund*
, an institution financed by public U.S.
taxpayer dollars which supports independent efforts towards a more secure
and private Internet. As a side-note, Cryptocat was even featured
in a *The New York Times* article back when it (and myself) were quite
young and starting up.
Cryptocat does not offer the services of either *Signal* or *SecureDrop*:
it does not run on mobile devices and its user experience is not directly
focused on the anonymous leaking of documents. Cryptocat is desktop
software that offers a service similar to *Google Talk* or *Yahoo Messenger*:
desktop chat with the ability to send large files, video messages, and
offline messages. Unlike those services, Cryptocat couples these features
with strong encryption, support for multiple devices and advanced security
features  such as certificate pinning,
forward secrecy and future secrecy. When you use Cryptocat, the aim is that
we cannot ever decipher the messages and files you communicate.
However, *The New York Times*'s tips page also recommends a third tool,
*PGP* , implemented through the *Mailvelope* browser
extension, which allows users to send encrypted emails to *The New York
The goal is of letter is to petition for Cryptocat's inclusion instead of
*PGP*. *PGP* does not offer a standard of security that merits its
inclusion, while Cryptocat does provide a clearly higher standard of
security and privacy than *PGP* when used under the same use-case. Here is
the reasoning behind this claim:
Cryptocat vs. PGP: On History
It is best to start with the obvious: in the case that Cryptocat was ever
considered by *The New York Times* for their tips page, it was likely
almost immediately dismissed due to its history of critical vulnerabilities
in different
of its engineering during its early development. In 2012 and 2013,
Cryptocat fell to regrettable lapses in engineering practices that led to a
well-deserved weakening of its reputation. Cryptocat clearly failed its
users on multiple occasions, and for the past three years, I have been
deeply sorry and regretful for these mistakes and I have dedicated all the
effort that is within my capacity to mitigating them and preventing them in
the future.
Nevertheless, every time these vulnerabilities were reported, Cryptocat
responded with full disclosure, immediately issuing security updates and
publicly thanking and crediting the security researchers responsible for
their discovery.
*PGP*, on the other hand, is a well-studied protocol, owing largely to its
initial release in 1991, a clean two decades before Cryptocat's inception.
The *PGP* protocol's maturity notwithstanding, it should be noted that
*Mailvelope* is actually younger than Cryptocat and still uses some of the
engineering practices that Cryptocat was often criticized for, such as
working inside the web browser and even going further than Cryptocat ever
did, by injecting code into web pages that it does not control. Cryptocat
recognized these engineering practices as fundamentally unsafe and
completely moved away from them in its rewrite this year as a pure desktop
The truth is that since its complete rewrite in March 2016, Cryptocat has
simply adopted engineering fundamentals that are known to be undoubtedly
safer than those used by *Mailvelope*, and has been able to integrate
encryption technologies that the ossified *PGP* protocol cannot hope to
accomplish. Furthermore, Cryptocat's new rewrite as a desktop application
was undergone during my graduate studies, in an environment where I had the
resources to produce dependable software. Cryptocat's rewrite was in fact
largely informed by the research I participated in for an upcoming academic
publication (*Automated Verification for Secure Messaging Protocols and
their Implementations: A Symbolic and Computational Approach*) that studies
secure messaging in detail.
This is a stark difference from the first Cryptocat, which was developed as
one of my very first programming projects when I was twenty years old.
Judging the new Cryptocat desktop application on the basis of the older
Cryptocat browser extension is as legitimate as judging a *Boeing 747* on
the basis of the performance of the Wright Brothers' first functioning
aeroplane. This sort of comparison must not be the benchmark with which
security software is evaluated.
It is true that *PGP* remains more aged than Cryptocat. But we are not in
the business of fine wine here; *Signal*, *SecureDrop* and any other tool
worth using is not only younger than *PGP* but younger than Cryptocat
itself. We should judge based on engineering merit, not on age. And when
past reputation is concerned, I believe that Cryptocat has honestly done
the work to obtain full merit for its excellence in moving past its early
blunders into dependable software.
Cryptocat vs. PGP: On Cryptographic Security
In *PGP*, all emails ever sent by a tipster are encrypted with one single
private key, which is kept indefinitely on the user's computer. This
private key can only be changed or reset via a manual and relatively
obscure process. Whenever this is done, the user's new public key must be
communicated manually to all of its contacts. If this single private key is
ever compromised, all of that user's prior communications, emails and
attachments are forever compromised. If a user wants to use their same *PGP*
identity on multiple devices, the compromise of one device compromises all
of their past communications from all of their devices. In *"What's the
Matter with PGP?"*
“For all the good *PGP* has done in the past, it’s a model of email
encryption that’s fundamentally broken. It’s time for *PGP* to die. [...] A
*PGP* critic is just a *PGP* user who’s actually used the software for a
while. At this point so much potential in this area and so many
opportunities to do better. It’s time for us to adopt those ideas and stop
looking backwards.”
Cryptocat is cryptographically superior to *PGP* in almost every respect:
   - *No Long-Term Encryption Key*: By basing its cryptography on the
   innovative *Double Ratchet*
   algorithm, Cryptocat's chat encryption    generates a fresh encryption key for every message. The theft of a device
   therefore only compromises the last small handful of messages, and only
   allows the user to impersonate the victim's device until that key is
   disassociated from the user's account.
   - *Forward and Future Secrecy*: If, at any point, the state of the
   encryption keys for a conversation is compromised, the conversation's
   security will *self-heal* with fresh key material, preventing the
   compromise of any past or future messages.
   - *Multi-Device Support*: Cryptocat supports linking multiple devices to
   a user's account through its implementation of the OMEMO
    standard. Cryptocat extends this to
   allow recipients to authenticate contacts on a per-device basis and to see
   which device was used to send a particular message. If a device's identity
   keys are stolen, only that device may be impersonated, and the owner may
   unlink it from their Cryptocat account using any other device.
To be clear, no one is claiming that Cryptocat is invincible. But all
empirical analysis of the current cryptographic protocol indicates that it
stands a better chance than *PGP* in terms of surviving a compromise or an
active attacker.
Cryptocat vs. PGP: On Metadata
Let's assume a scenario in which someone is listening on the tipster's
Internet connection. If the tipster uses PGP, the following information
will be leaked:
   - *Email Address*: The tipster will need to sign up for an email
   account. This is more likely than not to be a semi-permanent indentifer,
   since obtaining an email account without some kind of SMS verification is
   becoming increasingly restricted by major providers such as Gmail and
   Microsoft. The email service provider will then log IP addresses used to
   log into that email, which email addresses sent tips to a *The New York
   Times* email address, and more. If the tipster uses their regular email
   address, they are almost certainly in trouble.
   - *Key Metadata*: *PGP* keys carry a significant amount of metadata,
   including the *PGP* version used to encrypt the message, the date the
   key was created, and much more. In order to correctly authenticate a
   *PGP* key, more identifying information might have to exist in order to
   convincingly correlate a key to an owner.
With Cryptocat, users can create  random,
one-time-use usernames without needing to provide a phone number or email
address, or anything really. The only metadata the Cryptocat server sees is
that a random username was used to send a message to *The New York Times*'s
account. The Cryptocat server does not retain any other information,
including account creation time, IP addresses used to login, or anything
else. Someone spying on the tipster's network will only be able to see that
the tipster at some point used Cryptocat, but cannot identify which
username the tipster used, or with whom the tipster communicated. Once the
tip is communicated, Cryptocat users may choose to delete their account
, which completely erases any
trace of the account on Cryptocat's servers.
Once again, the hard, concrete facts indicate that Cryptocat is superior to
*PGP* in terms of metadata. However, it should still be noted that
Cryptocat, *PGP* and the other softare recommended by *The New York Times*
still leak substantially more metadata than *SecureDrop*: tipsters with a
strong metadata-related concern should consider using *SecureDrop* instead.
Cryptocat vs. PGP: On Usability
*PGP* is notorious for how painful it is to use. Cryptographers almost
unanimously consider its usability to be the source of mistakes that can
jeopardize user security within the first email they attempt to send. Aside
from Matthew Green's above-quoted post on *PGP*, *Signal*'s original
programmer also had this  to say:
When I receive a *PGP* encrypted email from a stranger, though, I
immediately get the feeling that I don’t want to read it. [...] *PGP* is a
technology dead end [...] In the 1990s, I was excited about the future, and
I dreamed of a world where everyone would install *PGP*. Now I’m still
excited about the future, but I dream of a world where I can uninstall it.
When using *PGP*, users must manually set up email clients and *PGP*
plugins, all of varying degrees of quality and dependability. They must
sign up with an email provider that might not respect their rights to
privacy. They must manually generate *PGP* key pairs and communicate them
to their third party, or upload them to a "key server" for out-of-band
authentication. Finally, they must manually download and import the
recipient's public key.
In comparison, using Cryptocat involves downloading the client, signing up,
registering your device, adding your recipient as a buddy and sending a
message (after optionally verifying their device list via a friendly user
interface). Unlike *PGP*, the workflow is almost exactly similar to that of
popular applications such as *Skype*, therefore, there is crucially less
room for the user to make a mistake.
Aside from having less room for failure, Cryptocat also simply offers more
features: support for multiple devices, each with a separate identity.
Online and offline messaging. File sharing with file sizes of up to 200MB,
which is far beyond what email attachments allow. And while this might be
less useful for tipsters, Cryptocat also allows users to record video
messages right from within their chat window.
Cryptocat: Not Perfect but the Clear Better Choice
All software will have bugs. No solution is bulletproof. All of the tools
currently mentioned on the tips page of *The New York Times* has had
vulnerabilities of varying severity, and security updates are, therefore, a
fact of life for any software that we use and that matters.
However, when we dare to discern, when we judge based on fact and science,
we can clearly understand that Cryptocat is a better choice than *PGP*. In
line with the Cryptocat Mission Statement ,
Cryptocat will strive to be dependable software that deserves to be the
conduit between some of the world's best journalists and stories that might
change our lives. I ask the staff at *The New York Times*, with the most
sincere good faith and the most serious intent to replace *PGP* with
Cryptocat. Over its six years of development, it has matured into
dependable software. It is the better choice.

deeply sorry and regretful for these mistakes and I have dedicated all the
effort that is within my capacity to mitigating them and preventing them in
the future.
Nevertheless, every time these vulnerabilities were reported, Cryptocat
responded with full disclosure, immediately issuing security updates and
publicly thanking and crediting the security researchers responsible for
their discovery.
*PGP*, on the other hand, is a well-studied protocol, owing largely to its
initial release in 1991, a clean two decades before Cryptocat's inception.
The *PGP* protocol's maturity notwithstanding, it should be noted that
*Mailvelope* is actually younger than Cryptocat and still uses some of the
engineering practices that Cryptocat was often criticized for, such as
working inside the web browser and even going further than Cryptocat ever
did, by injecting code into web pages that it does not control. Cryptocat
recognized these engineering practices as fundamentally unsafe and
completely moved away from them in its rewrite this year as a pure desktop
The truth is that since its complete rewrite in March 2016, Cryptocat has
simply adopted engineering fundamentals that are known to be undoubtedly
safer than those used by *Mailvelope*, and has been able to integrate
encryption technologies that the ossified *PGP* protocol cannot hope to
accomplish. Furthermore, Cryptocat's new rewrite as a desktop application
was undergone during my graduate studies, in an environment where I had the
resources to produce dependable software. Cryptocat's rewrite was in fact
largely informed by the research I participated in for an upcoming academic
publication (*Automated Verification for Secure Messaging Protocols and
their Implementations: A Symbolic and Computational Approach*) that studies
secure messaging in detail.
This is a stark difference from the first Cryptocat, which was developed as
one of my very first programming projects when I was twenty years old.
Judging the new Cryptocat desktop application on the basis of the older
Cryptocat browser extension is as legitimate as judging a *Boeing 747* on
the basis of the performance of the Wright Brothers' first functioning
aeroplane. This sort of comparison must not be the benchmark with which
security software is evaluated.
It is true that *PGP* remains more aged than Cryptocat. But we are not in
the business of fine wine here; *Signal*, *SecureDrop* and any other tool
worth using is not only younger than *PGP* but younger than Cryptocat
itself. We should judge based on engineering merit, not on age. And when
past reputation is concerned, I believe that Cryptocat has honestly done
the work to obtain full merit for its excellence in moving past its early
blunders into dependable software.
Cryptocat vs. PGP: On Cryptographic Security
In *PGP*, all emails ever sent by a tipster are encrypted with one single
private key, which is kept indefinitely on the user's computer. This
private key can only be changed or reset via a manual and relatively
obscure process. Whenever this is done, the user's new public key must be
communicated manually to all of its contacts. If this single private key is
ever compromised, all of that user's prior communications, emails and
attachments are forever compromised. If a user wants to use their same *PGP*
identity on multiple devices, the compromise of one device compromises all
of their past communications from all of their devices. In *"What's the
Matter with PGP?"*
“For all the good *PGP* has done in the past, it’s a model of email
encryption that’s fundamentally broken. It’s time for *PGP* to die. [...] A
*PGP* critic is just a *PGP* user who’s actually used the software for a
while. At this point so much potential in this area and so many
opportunities to do better. It’s time for us to adopt those ideas and stop
looking backwards.”
Cryptocat is cryptographically superior to *PGP* in almost every respect:
   - *No Long-Term Encryption Key*: By basing its cryptography on the
   innovative *Double Ratchet*
   algorithm, Cryptocat's chat encryption    generates a fresh encryption key for every message. The theft of a device
   therefore only compromises the last small handful of messages, and only
   allows the user to impersonate the victim's device until that key is
   disassociated from the user's account.
   - *Forward and Future Secrecy*: If, at any point, the state of the
   encryption keys for a conversation is compromised, the conversation's
   security will *self-heal* with fresh key material, preventing the
   compromise of any past or future messages.
   - *Multi-Device Support*: Cryptocat supports linking multiple devices to
   a user's account through its implementation of the OMEMO
    standard. Cryptocat extends this to
   allow recipients to authenticate contacts on a per-device basis and to see
   which device was used to send a particular message. If a device's identity
   keys are stolen, only that device may be impersonated, and the owner may
   unlink it from their Cryptocat account using any other device.
To be clear, no one is claiming that Cryptocat is invincible. But all
empirical analysis of the current cryptographic protocol indicates that it
stands a better chance than *PGP* in terms of surviving a compromise or an
active attacker.
Cryptocat vs. PGP: On Metadata
Let's assume a scenario in which someone is listening on the tipster's
Internet connection. If the tipster uses PGP, the following information
will be leaked:
   - *Email Address*: The tipster will need to sign up for an email
   account. This is more likely than not to be a semi-permanent indentifer,
   since obtaining an email account without some kind of SMS verification is
   becoming increasingly restricted by major providers such as Gmail and
   Microsoft. The email service provider will then log IP addresses used to
   log into that email, which email addresses sent tips to a *The New York
   Times* email address, and more. If the tipster uses their regular email
   address, they are almost certainly in trouble.
   - *Key Metadata*: *PGP* keys carry a significant amount of metadata,
   including the *PGP* version used to encrypt the message, the date the
   key was created, and much more. In order to correctly authenticate a
   *PGP* key, more identifying information might have to exist in order to
   convincingly correlate a key to an owner.
With Cryptocat, users can create  random,
one-time-use usernames without needing to provide a phone number or email
address, or anything really. The only metadata the Cryptocat server sees is
that a random username was used to send a message to *The New York Times*'s
account. The Cryptocat server does not retain any other information,
including account creation time, IP addresses used to login, or anything
else. Someone spying on the tipster's network will only be able to see that
the tipster at some point used Cryptocat, but cannot identify which
username the tipster used, or with whom the tipster communicated. Once the
tip is communicated, Cryptocat users may choose to delete their account
, which completely erases any
trace of the account on Cryptocat's servers.
Once again, the hard, concrete facts indicate that Cryptocat is superior to
*PGP* in terms of metadata. However, it should still be noted that
Cryptocat, *PGP* and the other softare recommended by *The New York Times*
still leak substantially more metadata than *SecureDrop*: tipsters with a
strong metadata-related concern should consider using *SecureDrop* instead.
Cryptocat vs. PGP: On Usability
*PGP* is notorious for how painful it is to use. Cryptographers almost
unanimously consider its usability to be the source of mistakes that can
jeopardize user security within the first email they attempt to send. Aside
from Matthew Green's above-quoted post on *PGP*, *Signal*'s original
programmer also had this  to say:
When I receive a *PGP* encrypted email from a stranger, though, I
immediately get the feeling that I don’t want to read it. [...] *PGP* is a
technology dead end [...] In the 1990s, I was excited about the future, and
I dreamed of a world where everyone would install *PGP*. Now I’m still
excited about the future, but I dream of a world where I can uninstall it.
When using *PGP*, users must manually set up email clients and *PGP*
plugins, all of varying degrees of quality and dependability. They must
sign up with an email provider that might not respect their rights to
privacy. They must manually generate *PGP* key pairs and communicate them
to their third party, or upload them to a "key server" for out-of-band
authentication. Finally, they must manually download and import the
recipient's public key.
In comparison, using Cryptocat involves downloading the client, signing up,
registering your device, adding your recipient as a buddy and sending a
message (after optionally verifying their device list via a friendly user
interface). Unlike *PGP*, the workflow is almost exactly similar to that of
popular applications such as *Skype*, therefore, there is crucially less
room for the user to make a mistake.
Aside from having less room for failure, Cryptocat also simply offers more
features: support for multiple devices, each with a separate identity.
Online and offline messaging. File sharing with file sizes of up to 200MB,
which is far beyond what email attachments allow. And while this might be
less useful for tipsters, Cryptocat also allows users to record video
messages right from within their chat window.
Cryptocat: Not Perfect but the Clear Better Choice
All software will have bugs. No solution is bulletproof. All of the tools
currently mentioned on the tips page of *The New York Times* has had
vulnerabilities of varying severity, and security updates are, therefore, a
fact of life for any software that we use and that matters.
However, when we dare to discern, when we judge based on fact and science,
we can clearly understand that Cryptocat is a better choice than *PGP*. In
line with the Cryptocat Mission Statement ,
Cryptocat will strive to be dependable software that deserves to be the
conduit between some of the world's best journalists and stories that might
change our lives. I ask the staff at *The New York Times*, with the most
sincere good faith and the most serious intent to replace *PGP* with
Cryptocat. Over its six years of development, it has matured into
dependable software. It is the better choice.

Okay, since you refuse to argue on reasonable grounds, I won't respond
to all of your attacks which didn't have any real argument except
attempts to demerit the concept of Holistic Medicine.  For the sake of
the list, I'm going to clarify what and why an H.D. is superior an
M.D. which you so fondly massage their crotch for, even though you are
probably overweight, nursing one or more addictions, and have lost
some desire to live exhibitiing some low-level depression.  (This is
the common case for liberal Americans.)
Holistic Health is greatly superior, even if not (to the published
establishment) scientifically more superior, because *logically*
health ITSELF is a factor of the WHOLE (hence HOListic), not the sum
of it`s parts (like reductionist Occidental medicine, who's glory
mostly goes back to the study of dead cadavers and anatomy -- those
who failed at making health).
Do you get this first point (reductionist vs. holistic)?  Holistic
Medicine *includes* the science that reductionism has built, but also
includes a WHOLE other set of data:  the subjective side of health
(how does the placebo affect has such an effect on health, for
example?).  So, it *transcends* the present medical establishment in
everyway, except when it comes to blunt trauma, like I said, where
they have mastery (bone setting and wound dressing).  EVERYTHING else
is 100% better served via holistic medicine.  Unfortunatley, there
just aren't many people trained in it.  I practially had to (re)invent
the field, because it was awash in pseudo-science, naive spiritualism,
and confusions of it's own identity and the use of drugs/supplements
as medical aids.
So I will define it here:  Holistic Health can diagnose and cure ANY
disease that Western medicine CLAIMS to cure but without invasive
procedures, including chemical-based ingestives (or inhalation).
Further, it can avoid the diseases and even mishaps in the first place
by creative a more holistic relationship to self, family, the
environment, and the divine.  I'll define this latter, for the sake of
arguing, as "that which transcends the human mind to grasp or
comprehend, but, nonetheless, exerting a force upon life itself".
Now that wasn't so hard was it?  Is that really difficult to take or
understand.  Western medicine would confound you with specialized
language, multi-million dollar equipment, and colored pillls -- all
types of power you likely have already given away becuase it seemed
impressive, right?
Well, America is one of the most diseased, confused, and destructive
nations on the planet and you and I know it.  It's on the street, it's
on Indian reservations, it's in abortion clinics and cosmetic
enhancement clinics, the larger-than-usual prison population, and it's
in the alarming severity of some brith defects.
So, tell me, why do you keep arguing for THEM?
No, it was actually addressed to Razor.  You, please, are in a state
of delusion, arguing with me, holding on to your last little island of
power that America has left you -- you're own voice.
Do you actually understand "neurology"?  No, and I know this because
doctors don't understand it, so how could you?
They're not forced.  They are feeling the weight of their life decisions.
You've given me a lot of data by your outbursts.  Do they say
something about you?  About what forces run your life, for example?
But it's not private.  If you planted a tree 50 yrs ago and made a
table with your own hands, the table is yours, but you didn't make the
power in marijuana.  Something else did.  Should people be able to
take whatever they want and use anything as they wish?  Is that what
you argue?
No, I got it from the only school worhty of issuing one:  the school
of hard knocks.  Maybe you feel intimidated by people with degrees
when you have none, but I'm using them to educate you.  Why fight me?

Software disenchantment
I’ve been programming for 15 years now. Recently our industry’s lack of
care for efficiency, simplicity, and excellence started really getting to
me, to the point of me getting depressed by my own career and the IT in
Modern cars work, let’s say for the sake of argument, at 98% of what’s
physically possible with the current engine design. Modern buildings use
just enough material to fulfill their function and stay safe under the
given conditions. All planes converged to the optimal size/form/load and
basically look the same.
Only in software, it’s fine if a program runs at 1% or even 0.01% of the
possible performance. Everybody just seems to be ok with it. People are
often even proud about how much inefficient it is, as in “why should we
worry, computers are fast enough”:
 : I
have a Python program I run every day, it takes 1.5 seconds. I spent six
hours re-writing it in rust, now it takes 0.06 seconds. That efficiency
improvement means I’ll make my time back in 41 years, 24 days :-)
You’ve probably heard this mantra: “programmer time is more expensive than
computer time”. What it means basically is that we’re wasting computers at
an unprecedented scale. Would you buy a car if it eats 100 liters per 100
kilometers? How about 1000 liters? With computers, we do that all the time.
 Everything is unbearably slow
Look around: our portable computers are thousands of times more powerful
than the ones that brought man to the moon. Yet every other webpage
struggles to maintain a smooth 60fps scroll on the latest top-of-the-line
MacBook Pro. I can comfortably play games, watch 4K videos but not scroll
web pages? How is it ok?
Google Inbox, a web app written by Google, running in Chrome browser also
by Google, takes 13 seconds to open moderately-sized emails
It also animates empty white boxes instead of showing their content because
it’s the only way anything can be animated on a webpage with decent
performance. No, decent doesn’t mean 60fps, it’s rather “as fast as this
web page could possibly go”. I’m dying to see web community answer when
120Hz displays become mainstream. Shit barely hits 60Hz already.
Windows 10 takes 30 minutes to update
. What could it possibly be doing
for that long? That much time is enough to fully format my SSD drive,
download a fresh build and install it like 5 times in a row.

update tiny rectangular region and modern text editors can’t do that in

hundreds of thousands (!!!) of polygons in the same 16ms and also process

As a general trend, we’re not getting faster software with more features.
We’re getting faster hardware that runs slower software with the same
features. Everything works way below the possible speed. Ever wonder why
your phone needs 30 to 60 seconds to boot? Why can’t it boot, say, in one
second? There are no physical limitations to that. I would love to see
that. I would love to see limits reached and explored, utilizing every last
bit of performance we can get for something meaningful in a meaningful way.
Everything is HUUUUGE
And then there’s bloat. Web apps could open up to 10× faster if you just
simply block all ads. Google begs everyone to stop shooting themselves in
their feet with AMP initiative—a technology solution to a problem that
doesn’t need any technology, just a little bit of common sense. If you
remove bloat, the web becomes crazy fast. How smart do you have to be to
understand that?
Android system with no apps takes almost 6 Gb
. Just think for a second how
obscenely HUGE that number is. What’s in there, HD movies? I guess it’s
basically code: kernel, drivers. Some string and resources too, sure, but
those can’t be big. So, how many drivers do you need for a phone?
Windows 95 was 30Mb. Today we have web pages heavier than that! Windows 10
is 4Gb, which is 133 times as big. But is it 133 times as superior? I mean,
functionally they are basically the same. Yes, we have Cortana, but I doubt
it takes 3970 Mb. But whatever Windows 10 is, is Android really 150% of
Google keyboard app routinely eats 150 Mb. Is an app that draws 30 keys on
a screen really five times more complex than the whole Windows 95? Google
app, which is basically just a package for Google Web Search, is 350 Mb!
Google Play Services, which I do not use (I don’t buy books, music or
videos there)—300 Mb that just sit there and which I’m unable to delete.
All that leaves me around 1 Gb for my photos after I install all the
essential (social, chats, maps, taxi, banks etc) apps. And that’s with no
games and no music at all! Remember times when an OS, apps and all your
data fit on a floppy?
Your desktop todo app is probably written in Electron and thus has userland

At least it works, you might say. Well, bigger doesn’t imply better. Bigger
means someone has lost control. Bigger means we don’t know what’s going on.
Bigger means complexity tax, performance tax, reliability tax. This is not
the norm and should not become the norm. Overweight apps should mean a red
flag. They should mean run away scared.
Everything rots
16Gb Android phone was perfectly fine 3 years ago. Today with Android 8.1

iPhone 4s was released with iOS 5, but can barely run iOS 9. And it’s not
because iOS 9 is that much superior—it’s basically the same. But their new
hardware is faster, so they made software slower. Don’t worry—you got
exciting new capabilities like…running the same apps with the same speed! I
iOS 11 dropped support for 32-bit apps. That means if the developer isn’t

DOS program can be made to run unmodified on pretty much any computer made

“It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place”. But
what’s the point? I might enjoy occasionally buying a new phone and new
MacBook as much as the next guy, but to do so just to be able to run all
the same apps which just became slower?
I think we can and should do better than that. Everyone is busy building
stuff for right now, today, rarely for tomorrow. But it would be nice to
also have stuff that lasts a little longer than that.
Worse is better
Nobody understands anything at this point. Neither they want to. We just

Most collaborative implementations are “best effort” and have many
common-life scenarios in which they lose data. Ever seen this dialogue
“which version to keep?” I mean, bar today is so low that your users would
be happy to at least have a window like that.

you get to choose which one” is not okay.
Linux kills random processes *by design*. And yet it’s the most popular

Every device I own fails regularly one way or another. My Dell monitor
needs a hard reboot from time to time because there’s software in it.
Airdrop? You’re lucky if it’ll detect your device, otherwise, what do I do?
Bluetooth? Spec is so complex that devices won’t talk to each other
and periodic resets are the best way to go
And I’m not even touching Internet of Things
. It’s so far beyond the laughing point
I’m not even sure what to add.
I want to take pride in my work. I want to deliver working, stable things.
To do that, we need to understand what we are building, in and out, and
that’s impossible to do in bloated, over-engineered systems.
Programming is the same mess
It just seems that nobody is interested in building quality, fast,
efficient, lasting, foundational stuff anymore. Even when efficient
solutions have been known for ages, we still struggle with the same
problems: package management, build systems, compilers, language design,
Build systems are inherently unreliable and periodically require full
clean, even though all info for invalidation is there. Nothing stops us
from making build process reliable, predictable and 100% reproducible. Just
nobody thinks its important. NPM has stayed in “sometimes works” state for
: It seems
to me that rm -rf node_modules is indispensable part of workflow when
developing Node.js/JavaScript projects.
And build times? Nobody thinks compiler that works minutes or even hours is
a problem. What happened to “programmer’s time is more important”? Almost
all compilers, pre- and post-processors add significant, sometimes
disastrous time tax to your build without providing proportionally
substantial benefits.
You would expect programmers to make mostly rational decisions, yet
sometimes they do the exact opposite of that. E.g. choosing Hadoop even
when it’s slower than running the same task on a single desktop
Machine learning and “AI” moved software to guessing in the times when most
computers are not even reliable enough in the first place.
 : When an
app or a service is described as “AI-powered” or “ML-based”, I read it as
“unreliable, unpredictable, and impossible to reason about behavior”. I try
to avoid “AI” because I want computers to be the opposite: reliable,
predictable, reasonable.
We put virtual machines inside Linux, and then we put Docker inside virtual
machines, simply because nobody was able to clean up the mess that most
programs, languages and their environment produce. We cover shit with

Move fast, don’t fix.
That is not engineering. That’s just lazy programming. Engineering is
understanding performance, structure, limits of what you build, deeply.
Combining poorly written stuff with more poorly written stuff goes strictly
against that. To progress, we need to understand what and why are we doing.
We’re stuck with it
So everything is just a pile of barely working code added on top of
previously written barely working code. It keeps growing in size and
complexity, diminishing any chance for a change.
To have a healthy ecosystem you *need* to go back and revisit. You *need*
to occasionally throw stuff away and replace it with better stuff.
But who has time for that? We haven’t seen new OS kernels in what, 25
years? It’s just too complex to simply rewrite by now. Browsers are so full
of edge cases and historical precedents by now that nobody dares to write
layout engine from scratch.
Today’s definition of progress is either throw more fuel into the fire:
 : 2014 -
We must adopt  to solve all problems with monoliths.
2016 - We must adopt  to solve all problems with microservices.
2018 - We must adopt  to solve all problems with docker
or reinventing the wheel:
 : 2000:
Write 100s of lines of XML to “declaratively” configure your servlets and
2018: Write 100s of lines of YAML to “declaratively” configure your

We’re stuck with what we have, and nobody will ever save us.
Business won’t care
Neither will users. They are only learned to expect what we can provide. We
(engineers) say every Android app takes 350 Mb? Ok, they’ll live with that.
We say we can’t give them smooth scrolling? Ok, they’ll live with a phone
that stutter. We say “if it doesn’t work, reboot”? They’ll reboot. After
all, they have no choice.
There’s no competition either. Everybody is building the same slow,
bloated, unreliable products. Occasional jump forward in quality does bring
competitive advantage (iPhone/iOS vs other smartphones, Chrome vs other
browsers) and forces everybody to regroup, but not for long.
So it’s our mission as engineers to show the world what’s possible with
today’s computers in terms of performance, reliability, quality, usability.
If we care, people will learn. And there’s nobody but us to show them that
it’s very much possible. If only we care.
It’s not all bad
There are some bright spots indicating that improving over state-of-the-art
is not impossible.
Work Martin Thompson  has being doing (LMAX
Disruptor , SBE
, Aeron
) is impressive, refreshingly simple
and efficient.
Xi editor  by Raph Levien seems to be
built with the right principles in mind.
Jonathan Blow  has a language he
alone develops for his game that can compile 500k lines per second on his
laptop. That’s cold compile, no intermediate caching, no incremental builds.
You don’t have to be a genius to write fast programs. There’s no magic
trick. The only thing required is not building on top of a huge pile of
crap that modern toolchain is.
Better world manifesto
I want to see progress. I want change. I want state-of-the-art in software
engineering to improve, not just stand still. I don’t want to reinvent the
same stuff over and over, less performant and more bloated each time. I
want something to believe in, a worthy end goal, a future better than what
we have today, and I want a community of engineers who share that vision.
What we have today is not progress. We barely meet business goals with poor
tools applied over the top. We’re stuck in local optima and nobody wants to
move out. It’s not even a good place, it’s bloated and inefficient. We just
somehow got used to it.
So I want to call it out: where we are today is bullshit. As engineers, we
can, and should, and will do better. We can have better tools, we can build
better apps, faster, more predictable, more reliable, using fewer resources
(orders of magnitude fewer!). We need to understand deeply what are we
doing and why. We need to deliver: reliably, predictably, with topmost
quality. We can—and should–take pride in our work. Not just “given what we
had…”—no buts!
I hope I’m not alone at this. I hope there are people out there who want to
do the same. I’d appreciate if we at least start talking about how absurdly
bad our current situation in the software industry is. And then we maybe
figure out how to get out.

Software disenchantment
I’ve been programming for 15 years now. Recently our industry’s lack of
care for efficiency, simplicity, and excellence started really getting to
me, to the point of me getting depressed by my own career and the IT in
Modern cars work, let’s say for the sake of argument, at 98% of what’s
physically possible with the current engine design. Modern buildings use
just enough material to fulfill their function and stay safe under the
given conditions. All planes converged to the optimal size/form/load and
basically look the same.
Only in software, it’s fine if a program runs at 1% or even 0.01% of the
possible performance. Everybody just seems to be ok with it. People are
often even proud about how much inefficient it is, as in “why should we
worry, computers are fast enough”:
 : I
have a Python program I run every day, it takes 1.5 seconds. I spent six
hours re-writing it in rust, now it takes 0.06 seconds. That efficiency
improvement means I’ll make my time back in 41 years, 24 days :-)
You’ve probably heard this mantra: “programmer time is more expensive than
computer time”. What it means basically is that we’re wasting computers at
an unprecedented scale. Would you buy a car if it eats 100 liters per 100
kilometers? How about 1000 liters? With computers, we do that all the time.
 Everything is unbearably slow
Look around: our portable computers are thousands of times more powerful
than the ones that brought man to the moon. Yet every other webpage
struggles to maintain a smooth 60fps scroll on the latest top-of-the-line
MacBook Pro. I can comfortably play games, watch 4K videos but not scroll
web pages? How is it ok?
Google Inbox, a web app written by Google, running in Chrome browser also
by Google, takes 13 seconds to open moderately-sized emails
It also animates empty white boxes instead of showing their content because
it’s the only way anything can be animated on a webpage with decent
performance. No, decent doesn’t mean 60fps, it’s rather “as fast as this
web page could possibly go”. I’m dying to see web community answer when
120Hz displays become mainstream. Shit barely hits 60Hz already.
Windows 10 takes 30 minutes to update
. What could it possibly be doing
for that long? That much time is enough to fully format my SSD drive,
download a fresh build and install it like 5 times in a row.
Pavel Fatin : Typing in
editor is a relatively simple process, so even 286 PCs were able to provide
a rather fluid typing experience.
Modern text editors have higher latency than 42-year-old Emacs. Text
editors! What can be simpler? On each keystroke, all you have to do is
update tiny rectangular region and modern text editors can’t do that in
16ms. It’s a lot of time. A LOT. A 3D game can fill the whole screen with
hundreds of thousands (!!!) of polygons in the same 16ms and also process
input, recalculate the world and dynamically load/unload resources. How
As a general trend, we’re not getting faster software with more features.
We’re getting faster hardware that runs slower software with the same
features. Everything works way below the possible speed. Ever wonder why
your phone needs 30 to 60 seconds to boot? Why can’t it boot, say, in one
second? There are no physical limitations to that. I would love to see
that. I would love to see limits reached and explored, utilizing every last
bit of performance we can get for something meaningful in a meaningful way.
Everything is HUUUUGE
And then there’s bloat. Web apps could open up to 10× faster if you just
simply block all ads. Google begs everyone to stop shooting themselves in
their feet with AMP initiative—a technology solution to a problem that
doesn’t need any technology, just a little bit of common sense. If you
remove bloat, the web becomes crazy fast. How smart do you have to be to
understand that?
Android system with no apps takes almost 6 Gb
. Just think for a second how
obscenely HUGE that number is. What’s in there, HD movies? I guess it’s
basically code: kernel, drivers. Some string and resources too, sure, but
those can’t be big. So, how many drivers do you need for a phone?
Windows 95 was 30Mb. Today we have web pages heavier than that! Windows 10
is 4Gb, which is 133 times as big. But is it 133 times as superior? I mean,
functionally they are basically the same. Yes, we have Cortana, but I doubt
it takes 3970 Mb. But whatever Windows 10 is, is Android really 150% of
Google keyboard app routinely eats 150 Mb. Is an app that draws 30 keys on
a screen really five times more complex than the whole Windows 95? Google
app, which is basically just a package for Google Web Search, is 350 Mb!
Google Play Services, which I do not use (I don’t buy books, music or
videos there)—300 Mb that just sit there and which I’m unable to delete.
All that leaves me around 1 Gb for my photos after I install all the
essential (social, chats, maps, taxi, banks etc) apps. And that’s with no
games and no music at all! Remember times when an OS, apps and all your
data fit on a floppy?
Your desktop todo app is probably written in Electron and thus has userland
driver for Xbox 360 controller in it
, can render
3d graphics and play audio and take photos with your web camera.
A simple text chat is notorious for its load speed and memory consumption.
Yes, you really have to count Slack in as a resource-heavy application. I
mean, chatroom and barebones text editor, those are supposed to be two of
the less demanding apps in the whole world. Welcome to 2018.
At least it works, you might say. Well, bigger doesn’t imply better. Bigger
means someone has lost control. Bigger means we don’t know what’s going on.
Bigger means complexity tax, performance tax, reliability tax. This is not
the norm and should not become the norm. Overweight apps should mean a red
flag. They should mean run away scared.
Everything rots
16Gb Android phone was perfectly fine 3 years ago. Today with Android 8.1
it’s barely usable because each app has become at least twice as big *for
no apparent reason*. There are no additional functions. They are not faster
or more optimized. They don’t look different. They just…grow?
iPhone 4s was released with iOS 5, but can barely run iOS 9. And it’s not
because iOS 9 is that much superior—it’s basically the same. But their new
hardware is faster, so they made software slower. Don’t worry—you got
exciting new capabilities like…running the same apps with the same speed! I
iOS 11 dropped support for 32-bit apps. That means if the developer isn’t
around at the time of iOS 11 release or isn’t willing to go back and update
a once-perfectly-fine app, chances are you won’t be seeing their app ever
 : A
DOS program can be made to run unmodified on pretty much any computer made
since the 80s. A JavaScript app might break with tomorrow’s Chrome update
Web pages working today would not be compatible with any browser in 10
years time  (probably sooner).
“It takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place”. But
what’s the point? I might enjoy occasionally buying a new phone and new
MacBook as much as the next guy, but to do so just to be able to run all
the same apps which just became slower?
I think we can and should do better than that. Everyone is busy building
stuff for right now, today, rarely for tomorrow. But it would be nice to
also have stuff that lasts a little longer than that.
Worse is better
Nobody understands anything at this point. Neither they want to. We just
throw barely baked shit out there, hope for the best and call it “startup
Web pages ask you to refresh if anything goes wrong. Who has time to figure
out what happened?
Any web app produces a constant stream of “random” JS errors in the wild,
even on compatible browsers.
The whole webpage/SQL database architecture is built on a premise (hope,
even) that nobody will touch your data while you look at the rendered
Most collaborative implementations are “best effort” and have many
common-life scenarios in which they lose data. Ever seen this dialogue
“which version to keep?” I mean, bar today is so low that your users would
be happy to at least have a window like that.
And no, in my world app that says “I’m gonna destroy some of your work, but
you get to choose which one” is not okay.
Linux kills random processes *by design*. And yet it’s the most popular
server-side OS.
Every device I own fails regularly one way or another. My Dell monitor
needs a hard reboot from time to time because there’s software in it.
Airdrop? You’re lucky if it’ll detect your device, otherwise, what do I do?
Bluetooth? Spec is so complex that devices won’t talk to each other
and periodic resets are the best way to go
And I’m not even touching Internet of Things
. It’s so far beyond the laughing point
I’m not even sure what to add.
I want to take pride in my work. I want to deliver working, stable things.
To do that, we need to understand what we are building, in and out, and
that’s impossible to do in bloated, over-engineered systems.
Programming is the same mess
It just seems that nobody is interested in building quality, fast,
efficient, lasting, foundational stuff anymore. Even when efficient
solutions have been known for ages, we still struggle with the same
problems: package management, build systems, compilers, language design,
Build systems are inherently unreliable and periodically require full
clean, even though all info for invalidation is there. Nothing stops us
from making build process reliable, predictable and 100% reproducible. Just
nobody thinks its important. NPM has stayed in “sometimes works” state for
: It seems
to me that rm -rf node_modules is indispensable part of workflow when
developing Node.js/JavaScript projects.
And build times? Nobody thinks compiler that works minutes or even hours is
a problem. What happened to “programmer’s time is more important”? Almost
all compilers, pre- and post-processors add significant, sometimes
disastrous time tax to your build without providing proportionally
substantial benefits.
You would expect programmers to make mostly rational decisions, yet
sometimes they do the exact opposite of that. E.g. choosing Hadoop even
when it’s slower than running the same task on a single desktop
Machine learning and “AI” moved software to guessing in the times when most
computers are not even reliable enough in the first place.
 : When an
app or a service is described as “AI-powered” or “ML-based”, I read it as
“unreliable, unpredictable, and impossible to reason about behavior”. I try
to avoid “AI” because I want computers to be the opposite: reliable,
predictable, reasonable.
We put virtual machines inside Linux, and then we put Docker inside virtual
machines, simply because nobody was able to clean up the mess that most
programs, languages and their environment produce. We cover shit with
blankets just not to deal with it. “Single binary” is still a HUGE selling
point for Go, for example. No mess == success.
And dependencies? People easily add overengineered “full package solutions”
to solve the simplest problems without considering their costs. And those
dependencies bring other dependencies. You end up with a tree that is
something in between of horror story (OMG so big and full of conflicts) and

Forwarding a great message from the cryptome list.
---------- Forwarded message ---------
see url: Cryptome.org was publishing classified and secret documents long before
WikiLeaks made headlines. Cryptome co-founder John Young told RT such
sites are allowed to stay online so that spy services might keep an eye
on their visitors.
There is no secrecy on the Internet, John Young warned.“In terms of
their being able to see everything that we are doing, we know that we
cannot keep any secrets about our site and we tell our readers, ‘You
should not expect us to protect you, because we are being watched and
every other site is being watched, just like WikiLeaks is being
watched,’” he said. “There’s no secrecy on the Internet – that’s the
lesson we’ve learned and we are now trying to spread that.”“They [the
security services] use our site to see what’s going on and that’s
something that we’ve learned about sites like ours. They are left in
place in order to watch who comes there and see what kind of information
we’ve put up,” John Young added. “The reason we haven’t been shut down
is that we are useful to them to see what kind of attention is paid to
this material. We think they actually feed us material to put up as they
are feeding information to WikiLeaks and many other sites that operate
the same way.”John Young said Cryptome grew out of his participation in
the group called Cypherpunks – which was also the group in which Julian
Assange learned his skills.“This group was composed of very
highly-educated engineers, scientists and technicians who were mostly
working for corporations and government on the technology of
communication security,” he said.Cryptome’s co-founder said secrecy is a
biggest enemy of democracy.“Threats to democracy come from the secret
keepers, and they need to be exposed. It has become a huge industry and
it’s extremely expensive,” he said. “And you can’t criticize it, you
can’t get access to it, because those who go inside that world are sworn
to life-time secrecy about it and they can never talk about it.”“This is
a system which is anti-democratic and it’s a big business now. Thousands
of firms have been drawn into it since 9/11, because it is very
lucrative. We need to have less secrecy in Congress, less secrecy in the
presidency, less secrecy in all forms of government,” he says.John Young
said governments leak more information for their own purposes than all
the secret leaking websites put together.“They [governments] run
operations to leak secrets to test their own system,” he said. “There
are schools to train people doing just that on the Internet. They teach
their own people how to run these sting operations by leaking
information to test their system. They are sometimes called A-teams and
