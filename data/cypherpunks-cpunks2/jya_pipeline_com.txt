Has there been examination about the more the US uses lethal drones overseas
the more likely IEDs or other asymmetrical weapons will be employed in the US
and allies, including plethora of makeshift CBRN (+Digital)?
Or are drones the bait being dangled for just that consequence? Recall the
military view that 9/11 was a pinprick not a serious attack worthy of mighty
military reaction, more a police matter. Perhaps useful as a provocation
for increased funding and churning.
Perhaps drones are as useful as hacks to instigate fire-up idling machinery
of warfare facing dismantline by looming budgtary reductions. Oh, right,
like 9/11 conspiracy theorists doomsay.
Curious, that so little is heard about how to beat the drones although there
must be copious of counter-drone studies in the military think tanks. Oh, national security restricted.

@_subject: The Internet is a surveillance state 
That the Internet is a gigantic spying machine has been known since
its invention, the security industry has made billions pretending to
protect against its surveillance.
Schneier has also written recently that security does not work,
cannot work, that attackers are always going to excell over defenders,
due to the economic incentives to attack being greater than those
to defend.
Long a top expert selling security services, what is Schneier up to
with gloom and doom that is usually associated with selling
snake oil -- his favorite target. Has his amply promoted 24x7 services
been defeated by attackers? Is he keeping that quiet? Is he about to
be doxed, has been hit with a blackmail demand, or worse, his
defenses compromised? Who else among the experts are colluding
with this initiative to admit Internet deception from the git go?
Recall that beloved Peter Neumann and others advocate chucking
the current Internet and starting over with better security and privacy
basic requirements. Uh huh, and what will take its place, will it be
better or more snake oil? And what to do with all that stored data
of the world's greatest spying machine promoted with the complicity
of Internet advocates and the security industry?
Pardon, monsieur, foxes in the hen house, comes to mind.
Schneier says in his security-is-doomed-to-fail piece a public discussion
is needed on what to do, the experts don't have answers. That's a good
start after years of experts promising to do better next time, meanwhile
trust open source, trust us.
Where does snake oil end and "something better" begin?
Is something better ever not snake oil? Is a public discussion
of an issue never not rigged in favor of the organizers? Is
tumultous public discussion never not preamble to a coup
justified as needed to control the mob who has gotten out
of hand, who voted the wrong way, who attacked the
leaders? Who hacked the experts?
Coups are always justified as needed for security, and who

Now, this is not news, but also reminds that protestations of
injustice, outrage and anger, is all too often a conventional cover
for betrayal by cooperating witnesses.
Unfortunately, the same goes for eager participants in payback,
fault correction, workarounds, vengeance, product upgrades to
defeat the bastards. These exact means and methods were
allegedly used by Sabu to ensnare and imprison a batch of
confederates. An ancient practice effectively used on
Julian Assange: followers can be lethal.
Encryption offers squat protection from this kind of legal,
political and social engineering whose history is much
older and more effective than top coding, math, engineering,
ethics and brave challenges to authority. Usually, offer of
an irresistable plea deal, job contract, witness protection,
PR outpouring, turns a valiant outsider into a handsomely
rewarded insider. Mudge one of hundreds, perhaps thousands,
who got the warning message.
Then what to avoid the looming scythes the various Sabus (he is
surely not alone) have provided law enforcement to gradually
take down the opposition, not all at once but in the Snowden-Greenwald
manner, to slowly dribble prosecutions for maximum effect, promising

Still, recognize that hammering Hammond is meant to be
sickening, as with Manning, Anonymous and Lulzsec members.
In every case rats were coerced into incriminating others by
threats of doing to them what was done to Hammond. If nobody
is ever hammered the threats are not taken seriously.
At a HOPE panel on informants, several hackers disclosed
those pressures to rat, some succumbed and were let off,
Emmanuel Goldstein admitted it, some refused and were
jailed, Bernie-X, Kevin Mitnick. All agreed it is far worse to
go through than you think. Goldstein estimated 25% of hackers
are rats.
Barrett Brown is on the hot seat right now, being offering deals
to rat, as customary, with three (!) trials postponed to maintain
pressure. Shit, even his mom was used as a fed provocation to
misbehave then as a persuasion club as were Sabu's nephew
and niece.
Anybody with a high profile is targeted, so beware publicity
hounds crowing of derrying-do and urgings by high profilers
who may or may not be in the grips of the feds, and if not,
will soon be due to their publicity narcosis, and then used
as clubs or head to jail for obstruction and recidivism or
some other nut-squeezing -- even in jail they are offered
deals to rat and sentence reduced.
In or out jail the pressure to rat continues, as with Adrian
Lamo. Ex-cons never know if an overture is an LE sting or a
an honest request for advice, so they rat to be safe -- recall
they are obliged -- forever -- to report overtures, just like
ex-spies remain under the gun to rat for life. If you haven't
been there don't imagine you know what it's like.

That should have been Bernie-S, not -X. And Mitnick now runs
a rather profitable security service and lecture series.
About Jim Bell (he can speak for himself but I know best
how to smell and tell a rat):
The IRS secret agent leading Jim's chase, Agent Gordon, lurked
on cypherpunks for a long time, gathering names and addresses
to subpoena for Jim's grand jury probe and (first) trial. Several of us
were subpoenad along with cpunks records from some (John Gilmore
one of those). Some, like me, were summoned both for the grand jury
and the trial held in Tacoma, WA. (Sidebar: youngster Declan
McCullagh covered that and I urged him to report seditiously
enough to be sent to jail to build his rep -- he politely refused
to cellmate Jim.)
Short story (full account in the archive) is that not many supported
Jim all the way when the shit came down, indeed, brazenly ridiculed
his adventure, presumably to cover their ass from Agent Gordon
and co-lurkers always on duty hereabouts.
Who secretly ratted Jim at the grand jury remains unknown but their
behavior and sweat odor has been profiled by god and they will not
be given authentic bitcoins, only fakes with their undercover UID
embedded like Lamo.

in standards committees, those enjoying contracts and grants in
think tanks and universities, those in law firms and public interest
orgs, those in the media and academia, those in non-spy gov agencies,
pretending to be in opposition as they scramble to rejigger their
products and sales pitches, to exploit what is being fabricated
to diminish Snowden's revelations with new forms of secrecy,
technology, law, regulations, bribery, lobbying, grants, contracts,
list lurking, online and offline spying, break-ins, the usual kaboodle,
to assure the NSA goals are fulfilled.

Every SCIF has a unique identification (UID) based on its full

Same for each building and building site above and below
the surface.
Conventional SCIF design characteristics which are in the
public domain do not cover the full spectrum, typically
only the EM. Like CryptoAG and other ruses, SCIFs are
quite collectible behind the EM mask.
Similarly, TEMPEST characteristics which are in the public

signals and metrics of compromising emanations.
Some similarity to lie detection ruses.
There are likely other ruses, as customary comsec

With the rise of the Internet spying has become as ubiquitous as

Running a mail list is spying. Running a hosting service is spying.
Running a website is spying. Running a blog is sphing. Running a

keyserver is spying. Running an anonymizer is spying. Running
an academic data collector is spying. Offering free apps is spying.
Offering free comsec is spying.
Open source is spying. Lurking on fora is spying. Prowling Twitter,
Facebook, Reddit, Slashdot, SM, chat, OTR, Tor, the surface
net and deepnet gamut, is spying.
Baiting and arguing and flattering to induce dislosure is spying.
Hanging, recording, videoing, texting, at gatherings, conferences,
Blackhats, Defcons, RSAs, protests, squats, mash-ups, is spying.
Leaking and sharing in the public interest is spying.
Defending leakers and hackers and protestors is spying.
Accusing and blaming official spies is counterspying, that
is spying.
Journalism is spying, along with every profession, they all
Watching porn is spying, and how!
The public is not indifferent about spying, it is the principal
public past-time and often full-time. Thanks to the Internet and
a slew of personal devices spying has become better than
sex, better than gambling, better than drugs and liquor,
done openly and secretly, here there and everywhere.

The most common for of spying for all countries is that for
assuring payment of taxes. These agencies have dossiers,
agents, informants and contractors (tax lawyers) which put
the other spies to shame (and put as much fear in the oft-blamed
spies as in citizens).
In the US the main function of early spies was to catch tax
evaders. Not to overlook that the birth of the US was about who
got the bloodily-extorted taxes.
No greater cooperation among world governments exceeds
that for catching tax evaders. The few refuges stings.
Tax laws allow far greater intrusion than those for national security.
And terrified citizens are obligated to spy and rat themselves,
family, neighbors, bosses, co-revolutionaries in particular.
Taxpayers are paid bonuses for spying on and ratting each
other, and jump to obey tax obligations, albeit with an acceptable
amount of shaving the truth. Bribes are endemic, whistleblowers
deputies of the state.
Presumably the fashionista excitement of bitching about the
rest of the spies is aimed at curring favor with the most
persistenlty threatening of the TLAs which will swoop in
like the angel of death to remind of the inescapable collusion
of both death and taxes to meticulously spy on futile efforts
to wiggle out of what is due.
Discussing this topic can get a citizen is more trouble than

It is not either dribble / or "dump" as favored outlets are
pontificating, seemingly by ostentatious agreement to
limit harm to governments by harming the public.
Both: provide the documents in a publicly accessible
depository as well as narrate their significance for those
who prefer readers digest and authoritative guidance.
Right now, DocumntCloud provides this depository, holds
over 400,000 documents provided by "authenticated"
journalists to substantiate their reports and to share with
others. Nearly all of the Snowden documents are on file there.
Researchers and other journalists want to see original
material for their own edification, interpretations and
uses. And to balance the inevitable bias and lack of
understanding common to all of us. Bear in mind that
readers digests, narratives and editorials are entertaining
fiction like "news."
Similarly, WikiLeaks initially provided copious documents as
back-up to its commentary. And still does despite an uptick
in exhortatory narratives. So does Federation of American
Scientists, National Security Archive, Public Intelligence,
Crytpocomb, and dozens more, some very old, other new:
This dribbling of documents is a moneymaking scam which
may increase in harm by concealing information that puts
people in harm's way, not the spies and their agents. Or
worse, choking the flow is required by a confidential
negotiated agreement or policy to test the market, test
the USG response, vet with governments as most major
newpapers do "to limit harm" a code word of complicity.
At one point early on Greenwald says he considered setting a
web site for the documents to be called NSADocuments.
It is not clear what led him to go a conventional monetized
route with the Guardian. Nor the conditions under which
WaPo, O Globo, Der Spiegel, New York Times and ProPublica
were brought into the stream.
What is annoying for the special purpose of this honorable
list of understatement is the braying about encryption as if
that is now mandatory PR to show comsec responsibility.
Nothing about the well-known weaknesses of encryption, its frequent
failures, its backdoors, its extremely misleading marketing,
its long history of many failures and few successes, its
use for entrapment and tracking, its customary snake
oil claims, its recantment by original authors, its cover-up
by original authors, its hopelessly fuck-up state at the

A useful invention, or discovery, similar to that of public key
enryption, would be to devise a means to communicate such
that no communication, as we now know it, would actually occur.
Consider what ineffable thought led young Whit Diffie to imagine
PKC. He says it came to him at one point, not altogether believable
at first, thinking there must be a fault somewhere, if valid surely
it had been figured out before. As we know, it had been, by
the quiet Brits, and kept top secret.
What else like that is going on, has gone on, will gone on, all
the while evading classification at birth, not patented, not yet
institutionalized in secrecy madhouses hoarding the best and
brightest, as we know those terms of entrapment.
Consider that a non-communication ineffability has been invented,
or discovered, or is gestating in one or more young minds not
yet regimented by too much education, too much experience,
too much jaded skepticism, too little imagination, too much
comfort of reputation, salary, prizes and pensions, too much
blind faith in technology or mathematics, too much secrecy
as we know them to be crushing of novelty and waywardness.
For example, if the non-communication required no physical or
electromagnetic means but was based on say, conviction, or
concepts, or ideas, or imagination. The message would be
intuited, let us say, or grasped by deduction or induction, or
simply was shared without obvious effort except perhaps
an urge or yearning or desire or hunger or passion or insight,
or why not go for it, love.
Turns out this is not all that unusual. It is rather commonplace
if not ubiquitous. Animals do it, so do vegetables, and probably
minerals, though that is hard to say for sure, perhaps a volcanic
eruption or earthquake or asteroid is passing along content
as well as metadata.
Thought, perhaps faith, exchanges content by ineffability.
The arts, perhaps theoretical if not experimental science,
do too.
Brian Carroll has been exploring these possibilities for
some two decades. If he, then others, most of them
little known, not on the list of comsec wizards, not on

of the successors to Diffie  -- and the Brits silenced

"Frenkel believes math deserves to be an integral part of our

DNA and not symmetry groups? For one thing, you cant
get cancer from a mutation of a symmetry group. But
Frenkel writes that math 'directs the flow of the universe.'
Its as elegant as music and as much a part of our
intellectual heritage as literature. He strives to awaken
our wonder by taking us on an equation-packed tour of
his research, in which he reveals a hidden world few
of us encountered in school."
Returning to Whit Diffie musing on what led to his discovery
or invention of public key cryptography -- found in what might
be termed a hidden world of mathematics -- there may be
still hidden mathematical forms of communication that
does not rely upon technology's inevitable comsec failure.
The NSA global invasion appears almost wholly based on the
failure of technology rather than mathematics, as our esteemed
cryptographers remind. Much of the current tweaking and
further invention appear driven by technology, code,
engineering, politics, law and polemics, again not mathematics.
No wonder, that, for math is beyond grasp of those who
believe the non-mathematical is too hard to see, hear, smell,
touch, write, understand, market and melodramatically
induce media delirium by way of officially-hostile and
unauthorized disclosures.
Whither the NSA bountiful mathematicians in protecting
its family jewels of invasive technology? Stuck in crypto
labs musing like Diffies in manifold hideways?
Frenkel's linking of love and mathematics is worth pondering
in the face of the megalomania, demogoguery, popularity and
profitability of faultly technology, ever breeding abuse, counter
abuse, blame and exculpation, feeding the market for official

Appelbaum confirms, others have not yet done so, and may
be incapable of admitting limited knowledge after building

PKC and anonymizers have become a celebrity drugs.
Moreover, the valorization of comsec coding over the
physical architecture has misled both the coders and
their public about the weaknesses of comsec, a gaping
hole through which national spies have driven large
trucks to gather and transport mountains of data while
the cyber-guards gaze at online security programs,
engoring large fees for 24x7 protection, search and
destroy, Stuxnet, virii, hacks, 0-days, terrifying
Keep in mind this which has received almost no
attention now or in the past:
What is online and on the roof of embassies is not
the source of most spying, that is a ruse.
Every building has a unique identification (UID) based
on its comprehensive materiality of building materials,
mechanical and electrical systems, shape, spaces,
usage, population, devices used by inhabitants (coming
and going and resting), rate of deterioration, repairs,
renovations. This in addition to official records in
a slew of regulating agencies, contracts for services,
networks, bugs, taps, implants, human spies, automation,
fautly security systems.
In effect, every building is a transceiver of its metadata
and its contents without need for the ruse of local
penetration. Just an ocean-going vessel, aircraft or
satellite. Virtually nothing is being done to prevent
this self-disclosing transceiving. Tempest protection
is insignificant, and SCIFs are ridiculous.
It is not clear if Snowden knows this or has been deluded
by the blinding conceit of cyber war and as a consequence

promulgating to the great pleasure of those who know
exactly how to help him succeed by protesting vigorously.

The most common for of spying for all countries is that for
assuring payment of taxes. These agencies have dossiers,
agents, informants and contractors (tax lawyers) which put
the other spies to shame (and put as much fear in the oft-blamed

In the US the main function of early spies was to catch tax
evaders. Not to overlook that the birth of the US was about who
got the bloodily-extorted taxes.
No greater cooperation among world governments exceeds
that for catching tax evaders. The few refuges stings.
Tax laws allow far greater intrusion than those for national security.
And terrified citizens are obligated to spy and rat themselves,
family, neighbors, bosses, co-revolutionaries in particular.
Taxpayers are paid bonuses for spying on and ratting each
other, and jump to obey tax obligations, albeit with an acceptable
amount of shaving the truth. Bribes are endemic, whistleblowers
deputies of the state.
Presumably the fashionista excitement of bitching about the

It is not either dribble / or "dump" as favored outlets are
pontificating, seemingly by ostentatious agreement to
limit harm to governments by harming the public.
Both: provide the documents in a publicly accessible
depository as well as narrate their significance for those
who prefer readers digest and authoritative guidance.
Right now, DocumntCloud provides this depository, holds
over 400,000 documents provided by "authenticated"
journalists to substantiate their reports and to share with
others. Nearly all of the Snowden documents are on file there.
Researchers and other journalists want to see original
material for their own edification, interpretations and
uses. And to balance the inevitable bias and lack of
understanding common to all of us. Bear in mind that
readers digests, narratives and editorials are entertaining
fiction like "news."
Similarly, WikiLeaks initially provided copious documents as
back-up to its commentary. And still does despite an uptick
in exhortatory narratives. So does Federation of American
Scientists, National Security Archive, Public Intelligence,
Crytpocomb, and dozens more, some very old, other new:
This dribbling of documents is a moneymaking scam which
may increase in harm by concealing information that puts
people in harm's way, not the spies and their agents. Or
worse, choking the flow is required by a confidential
negotiated agreement or policy to test the market, test
the USG response, vet with governments as most major
newpapers do "to limit harm" a code word of complicity.
At one point early on Greenwald says he considered setting a
web site for the documents to be called NSADocuments.
It is not clear what led him to go a conventional monetized
route with the Guardian. Nor the conditions under which
WaPo, O Globo, Der Spiegel, New York Times and ProPublica
were brought into the stream.
What is annoying for the special purpose of this honorable
list of understatement is the braying about encryption as if
that is now mandatory PR to show comsec responsibility.
Nothing about the well-known weaknesses of encryption, its frequent
failures, its backdoors, its extremely misleading marketing,
its long history of many failures and few successes, its
use for entrapment and tracking, its customary snake
oil claims, its recantment by original authors, its cover-up
by original authors, its hopelessly fuck-up state at the

A useful invention, or discovery, similar to that of public key
enryption, would be to devise a means to communicate such
that no communication, as we now know it, would actually occur.
Consider what ineffable thought led young Whit Diffie to imagine
PKC. He says it came to him at one point, not altogether believable
at first, thinking there must be a fault somewhere, if valid surely
it had been figured out before. As we know, it had been, by
the quiet Brits, and kept top secret.
What else like that is going on, has gone on, will gone on, all
the while evading classification at birth, not patented, not yet
institutionalized in secrecy madhouses hoarding the best and
brightest, as we know those terms of entrapment.
Consider that a non-communication ineffability has been invented,
or discovered, or is gestating in one or more young minds not
yet regimented by too much education, too much experience,
too much jaded skepticism, too little imagination, too much
comfort of reputation, salary, prizes and pensions, too much
blind faith in technology or mathematics, too much secrecy
as we know them to be crushing of novelty and waywardness.
For example, if the non-communication required no physical or
electromagnetic means but was based on say, conviction, or
concepts, or ideas, or imagination. The message would be
intuited, let us say, or grasped by deduction or induction, or
simply was shared without obvious effort except perhaps
an urge or yearning or desire or hunger or passion or insight,
or why not go for it, love.
Turns out this is not all that unusual. It is rather commonplace
if not ubiquitous. Animals do it, so do vegetables, and probably
minerals, though that is hard to say for sure, perhaps a volcanic
eruption or earthquake or asteroid is passing along content
as well as metadata.
Thought, perhaps faith, exchanges content by ineffability.
The arts, perhaps theoretical if not experimental science,
do too.
Brian Carroll has been exploring these possibilities for
some two decades. If he, then others, most of them
little known, not on the list of comsec wizards, not on

of the successors to Diffie  -- and the Brits silenced

"Frenkel believes math deserves to be an integral part of our

DNA and not symmetry groups? For one thing, you cant
get cancer from a mutation of a symmetry group. But
Frenkel writes that math 'directs the flow of the universe.'
Its as elegant as music and as much a part of our
intellectual heritage as literature. He strives to awaken
our wonder by taking us on an equation-packed tour of
his research, in which he reveals a hidden world few
of us encountered in school."
Returning to Whit Diffie musing on what led to his discovery
or invention of public key cryptography -- found in what might
be termed a hidden world of mathematics -- there may be
still hidden mathematical forms of communication that
does not rely upon technology's inevitable comsec failure.
The NSA global invasion appears almost wholly based on the
failure of technology rather than mathematics, as our esteemed
cryptographers remind. Much of the current tweaking and
further invention appear driven by technology, code,
engineering, politics, law and polemics, again not mathematics.
No wonder, that, for math is beyond grasp of those who
believe the non-mathematical is too hard to see, hear, smell,
touch, write, understand, market and melodramatically
induce media delirium by way of officially-hostile and
unauthorized disclosures.
Whither the NSA bountiful mathematicians in protecting
its family jewels of invasive technology? Stuck in crypto
labs musing like Diffies in manifold hideways?
Frenkel's linking of love and mathematics is worth pondering
in the face of the megalomania, demogoguery, popularity and
profitability of faultly technology, ever breeding abuse, counter
abuse, blame and exculpation, feeding the market for official

be incapable of admitting limited knowledge after building

PKC and anonymizers have become a celebrity drugs.
Moreover, the valorization of comsec coding over the
physical architecture has misled both the coders and
their public about the weaknesses of comsec, a gaping
hole through which national spies have driven large
trucks to gather and transport mountains of data while
the cyber-guards gaze at online security programs,
engoring large fees for 24x7 protection, search and
destroy, Stuxnet, virii, hacks, 0-days, terrifying
Keep in mind this which has received almost no
attention now or in the past:
What is online and on the roof of embassies is not
the source of most spying, that is a ruse.
Every building has a unique identification (UID) based
on its comprehensive materiality of building materials,
mechanical and electrical systems, shape, spaces,
usage, population, devices used by inhabitants (coming
and going and resting), rate of deterioration, repairs,
renovations. This in addition to official records in
a slew of regulating agencies, contracts for services,
networks, bugs, taps, implants, human spies, automation,
fautly security systems.
In effect, every building is a transceiver of its metadata
and its contents without need for the ruse of local
penetration. Just an ocean-going vessel, aircraft or
satellite. Virtually nothing is being done to prevent
this self-disclosing transceiving. Tempest protection
is insignificant, and SCIFs are ridiculous.
It is not clear if Snowden knows this or has been deluded
by the blinding conceit of cyber war and as a consequence
does not know what comsec delusion he is sincerely
promulgating to the great pleasure of those who know
exactly how to help him succeed by protesting vigorously.

The most common for of spying for all countries is that for
assuring payment of taxes. These agencies have dossiers,
agents, informants and contractors (tax lawyers) which put
the other spies to shame (and put as much fear in the oft-blamed
spies as in citizens).
In the US the main function of early spies was to catch tax
evaders. Not to overlook that the birth of the US was about who
got the bloodily-extorted taxes.
No greater cooperation among world governments exceeds
that for catching tax evaders. The few refuges stings.
Tax laws allow far greater intrusion than those for national security.
And terrified citizens are obligated to spy and rat themselves,
family, neighbors, bosses, co-revolutionaries in particular.
Taxpayers are paid bonuses for spying on and ratting each
other, and jump to obey tax obligations, albeit with an acceptable
amount of shaving the truth. Bribes are endemic, whistleblowers
deputies of the state.
Presumably the fashionista excitement of bitching about the

The NSA Data Center is bit more complicated than the usual
commercial hotel or center, and perhaps is unprecedented,
thus haunted by errata.
It is composed of two apparently identical facilities, mirror
images of one another, connected by an administrative
Each facility has a data unit, a pair of 16-generator units,
a bank of cooling towers, fuel tanks and appurtances.
There is a single conventional electrical sub-station for
the complex.
It is it not known if both facilities were affected or only
one of them.
Nor is not known whether the power surges came from the
conventional electrical power system or the generators,
or from testing the emergency shutdown of the conventional
and the kick-in of the back-up gen sets.
Perhaps both powered up briefly simultaneously, overloaded
surge protectors failed, excessive juice blasted the cables,
panels, processors. The relatively small dollar amounts
indicate that only some parts were affected.
An odd feature is the banana shape, with non-parallel
units, whether for aesthetics or to avoid some unknown
richochet of parallelism so common in DoD and most other
Imagine that the lack of parallelism, surely due to the conceit
of crazed design architects eager to be different from insanely
rational engineers, caused bizarre effects, or the engineers
fought back with the customary make-work sabotage.
This theory is most pleasing to this nuthouse designer. It fits
the welter of new USG facilities worldwide which appear to
have been designed by and for the bureaucratcially insane,
aptly, expense not even considered, exemplary bloat essential,
security bollixed to the max, national debt boosting cost
over-runs and late completion obligatory for congressional
inspection junkets, followed quickly by applaudable manifold

Cryptographic protecton for a porous infrastructure appears the most
likely cause of the delusion, a favorite export of this list and other

and for the weakness of NSA infosec can be thanked for that.
Attention is not yet adequate for this commercial exploitation of

list raised alarms from the gitgo of encryption boosterism.
Commercial and non-official exploitation of the comsec delusion
remains far greater than that of official spies, including essential
undergirding of official spying.
Privacy policies in particular were invented as a ruse to divert
attention from ubiquitous spying on the public by online services
whether of governmental, commercial, institutional, non-profit,

opportuniism pretty well demolished by Mozorov and others,

It is not either dribble / or "dump" as favored outlets are
pontificating, seemingly by ostentatious agreement to
limit harm to governments by harming the public.
Both: provide the documents in a publicly accessible
depository as well as narrate their significance for those
who prefer readers digest and authoritative guidance.
Right now, DocumntCloud provides this depository, holds
over 400,000 documents provided by "authenticated"
journalists to substantiate their reports and to share with
others. Nearly all of the Snowden documents are on file there.
Researchers and other journalists want to see original
material for their own edification, interpretations and
uses. And to balance the inevitable bias and lack of
understanding common to all of us. Bear in mind that
readers digests, narratives and editorials are entertaining
fiction like "news."
Similarly, WikiLeaks initially provided copious documents as
back-up to its commentary. And still does despite an uptick
in exhortatory narratives. So does Federation of American
Scientists, National Security Archive, Public Intelligence,
Crytpocomb, and dozens more, some very old, other new:
This dribbling of documents is a moneymaking scam which
may increase in harm by concealing information that puts
people in harm's way, not the spies and their agents. Or
worse, choking the flow is required by a confidential
negotiated agreement or policy to test the market, test
the USG response, vet with governments as most major
newpapers do "to limit harm" a code word of complicity.
At one point early on Greenwald says he considered setting a
web site for the documents to be called NSADocuments.
It is not clear what led him to go a conventional monetized
route with the Guardian. Nor the conditions under which
WaPo, O Globo, Der Spiegel, New York Times and ProPublica
were brought into the stream.
What is annoying for the special purpose of this honorable
list of understatement is the braying about encryption as if
that is now mandatory PR to show comsec responsibility.
Nothing about the well-known weaknesses of encryption, its frequent
failures, its backdoors, its extremely misleading marketing,
its long history of many failures and few successes, its
use for entrapment and tracking, its customary snake
oil claims, its recantment by original authors, its cover-up
by original authors, its hopelessly fuck-up state at the

It is likely some techies fed tips and luridities to the German

A useful invention, or discovery, similar to that of public key
enryption, would be to devise a means to communicate such
that no communication, as we now know it, would actually occur.
Consider what ineffable thought led young Whit Diffie to imagine
PKC. He says it came to him at one point, not altogether believable
at first, thinking there must be a fault somewhere, if valid surely
it had been figured out before. As we know, it had been, by
the quiet Brits, and kept top secret.
What else like that is going on, has gone on, will gone on, all
the while evading classification at birth, not patented, not yet
institutionalized in secrecy madhouses hoarding the best and
brightest, as we know those terms of entrapment.
Consider that a non-communication ineffability has been invented,
or discovered, or is gestating in one or more young minds not
yet regimented by too much education, too much experience,
too much jaded skepticism, too little imagination, too much
comfort of reputation, salary, prizes and pensions, too much
blind faith in technology or mathematics, too much secrecy
as we know them to be crushing of novelty and waywardness.
For example, if the non-communication required no physical or
electromagnetic means but was based on say, conviction, or
concepts, or ideas, or imagination. The message would be
intuited, let us say, or grasped by deduction or induction, or
simply was shared without obvious effort except perhaps
an urge or yearning or desire or hunger or passion or insight,
or why not go for it, love.
Turns out this is not all that unusual. It is rather commonplace
if not ubiquitous. Animals do it, so do vegetables, and probably
minerals, though that is hard to say for sure, perhaps a volcanic
eruption or earthquake or asteroid is passing along content
as well as metadata.
Thought, perhaps faith, exchanges content by ineffability.
The arts, perhaps theoretical if not experimental science,
do too.
Brian Carroll has been exploring these possibilities for
some two decades. If he, then others, most of them
little known, not on the list of comsec wizards, not on

"Frenkel believes math deserves to be an integral part of our

DNA and not symmetry groups? For one thing, you cant
get cancer from a mutation of a symmetry group. But
Frenkel writes that math 'directs the flow of the universe.'
Its as elegant as music and as much a part of our
intellectual heritage as literature. He strives to awaken
our wonder by taking us on an equation-packed tour of
his research, in which he reveals a hidden world few
of us encountered in school."
Returning to Whit Diffie musing on what led to his discovery
or invention of public key cryptography -- found in what might
be termed a hidden world of mathematics -- there may be
still hidden mathematical forms of communication that
does not rely upon technology's inevitable comsec failure.
The NSA global invasion appears almost wholly based on the
failure of technology rather than mathematics, as our esteemed
cryptographers remind. Much of the current tweaking and
further invention appear driven by technology, code,
engineering, politics, law and polemics, again not mathematics.
No wonder, that, for math is beyond grasp of those who
believe the non-mathematical is too hard to see, hear, smell,
touch, write, understand, market and melodramatically
induce media delirium by way of officially-hostile and
unauthorized disclosures.
Whither the NSA bountiful mathematicians in protecting
its family jewels of invasive technology? Stuck in crypto
labs musing like Diffies in manifold hideways?
Frenkel's linking of love and mathematics is worth pondering
in the face of the megalomania, demogoguery, popularity and
profitability of faultly technology, ever breeding abuse, counter
abuse, blame and exculpation, feeding the market for official

of hardware and facilities for decades and has advised
several of the journalists covering the NSA releases who

Appelbaum confirms, others have not yet done so, and may
be incapable of admitting limited knowledge after building
careers of knowledgeability, yes, this is about cryptology

PKC and anonymizers have become a celebrity drugs.
Moreover, the valorization of comsec coding over the
physical architecture has misled both the coders and
their public about the weaknesses of comsec, a gaping
hole through which national spies have driven large
trucks to gather and transport mountains of data while
the cyber-guards gaze at online security programs,
engoring large fees for 24x7 protection, search and
destroy, Stuxnet, virii, hacks, 0-days, terrifying
Keep in mind this which has received almost no
attention now or in the past:
What is online and on the roof of embassies is not
the source of most spying, that is a ruse.
Every building has a unique identification (UID) based
on its comprehensive materiality of building materials,
mechanical and electrical systems, shape, spaces,
usage, population, devices used by inhabitants (coming
and going and resting), rate of deterioration, repairs,
renovations. This in addition to official records in
a slew of regulating agencies, contracts for services,
networks, bugs, taps, implants, human spies, automation,
fautly security systems.
In effect, every building is a transceiver of its metadata
and its contents without need for the ruse of local
penetration. Just an ocean-going vessel, aircraft or
satellite. Virtually nothing is being done to prevent
this self-disclosing transceiving. Tempest protection
is insignificant, and SCIFs are ridiculous.
It is not clear if Snowden knows this or has been deluded
by the blinding conceit of cyber war and as a consequence
does not know what comsec delusion he is sincerely
promulgating to the great pleasure of those who know
exactly how to help him succeed by protesting vigorously.

DigiCert's base standard is to use 2048-bit keys in secure SSL certificates - that is enormously stronger than anything Lenstra et al attempted, in fact, it would require factoring a 617-digit number. RSA Labs claim (see:  that 2048-bit keys are 2^32 (2 to the power of 32) times harder to break using NFS, than 1024-bit keys. 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 or almost 4.3 billion, therefore breaking a DigiCert 2048-bit SSL certificate would take about 4.3 billion times longer (using the same standard desktop processing) than doing it for a 1024-bit key. It is therefore estimated, that standard desktop computing power would take 4,294,967,296 x 1.5 million years to break a DigiCert 2048-bit SSL certificate. Or, in other words, a little over 6.4 quadrillion years.
In putting together our video, we estimated the age of the Universe to be 13,751,783,021 years or a little over 13.75 billion years, therefore if you tried to break a DigiCert 2048-bit SSL certificate using a standard modern desktop computer, and you started at the beginning of time, you would have expended 13 billion years of processing by the time you got back to today, and you would still have to repeat that entire process 468,481 times one after the other into our far far distant future before there was a good probability of breaking the certificate. In fact the Universe itself would grow dark before you even got close.

How secure is AES against brute force attacks?
Mohit Arora, Sr. Systems Engineer & Security Architect, Freescale Semiconductor
5/7/2012 05:29 PM EDT
Even with a supercomputer, it would take 1 billion billion years to crack the 128-bit AES key using brute force attack. This is more than the age of the universe (13.75 billion years). If one were to assume that a computing system existed that could recover a DES key in a second, it would still take that same machine approximately 149 trillion years to crack a 128-bit AES key.

The clock is ticking for encryption
The tidy world of cryptography may be upended by the arrival of quantum computers.
By Lamont Wood
March 21, 2011 06:00 AM ET
Today's encryption algorithms can be broken. Their security derives from the wildly impractical lengths of time it can take to do so.
Let's say you're using a 128-bit AES cipher. The number of possible keys with 128 bits is 2 raised to the power of 128, or 3.4x1038, or 340 undecillion. Assuming no information on the nature of the key is available (such as the fact that the owner likes to use his or her children's birthdays), a code-breaking attempt would require testing each possible key until one was found that worked.
Assuming that enough computing power was amassed to test 1 trillion keys per second, testing all possible keys would take 10.79 quintillion years. This is about 785 million times the age of the visible universe (13.75 billion years). On the other hand, you might get lucky in the first 10 minutes.
But using quantum technology with the same throughput, exhausting the possibilities of a 128-bit AES key would take about six months. If a quantum system had to crack a 256-bit key, it would take about as much time as a conventional computer needs to crack a 128-bit key.
A quantum computer could crack a cipher that uses the RSA or EC algorithms almost immediately.

Computers and networks are small pieces compared to

emitted, lofted, arrayed, hidden. Those structures of the
infrastructure are as costly as the human power and
much greater in scope and necessity -- and immensely
targetable thanks to ostentatious appurtenances of antennas,

prospect of complicity with authorities under rigging of

The Guardian has belatedly confessed to that. And WaPo

Meanwhile there is a need for more undoctored documents

Tor Project discussion lists have become characterized by a
a tone of dismissiveness, knee-jerkedness, when critiques
are presented. This is pretty common in such fora as they
age and lazy old-timers put down newbies as if a sport,
shooting fish in a barrel, or as in this instance, flogging a
dead horse.
Occasionally, again as in this instance of critiquing Hidden
Services, a thoughtful response is provided rather than a
putdown. The more experienced Tor contributors are not
as susceptible to putdowns as the middling and bottomers,
certainly not as offensive as the Tor Project promoters,
funders and fans.
It would be helpful to distinguish between those who know
onion-routing in depth and those who advocate its use
with what often appears to be primarily public relations and
advertizing disdain toward critics and inquirers.
Reviewing the depth of research at the Naval Research Laboratory
on network security and anonymization indicates that serious
research has been done long before Tor Project appeared.
Three of those researchers are affiliated with Tor Project
and keep it from being dubious flim-flammery in which
posing and pontificating front for technical inexperience.
Tor Project is more like a sales operation for scientific and
engineering endeavors. And in that role it boosts and promotes,
sounding sometimes like snake oil, another overused cliche,
than the skeptical and inquiring research at scientists and
engineers at the NRL.
Tor fora suffer the same consequences as this one, producing
mostly shallow bullshit, mea culpa, with occasional leads for
pursuing offline endeavors requiring much time for lasting
Chat and mail lists, like reader comments and polls, have
become promotional gimmicks, run by PR hustlers with
about as much knowledge of discussion topics as

One clue to unreliability is when a former engineer takes over
sales and deploys promotional hyperbole as the principal
marketing tool on fora, at talks, with speeches, articles,
interviews, fund-raisers, documentaries, books, parties,
conferences, 2P2, F2F, debates, all aimed at dominating
a niche.
In Tor Project's case, propaganda for illusory anonymity
has become its main product, as befits an org established
and funded by the USG for that purpose.
Naval Research Laboratory should not be demeaned to
the level of the all too slick Tor Project. And chattering
on Tor fora should not to be confused with substantial
contributions to helping protect the non-technical public
from technical exploitation by sales and advertising

More words from a non-techie:
David Kahn, James Bamford, Seymour Hersh and quite
a few NSA and other spy types, in particular heads of
agencies, Congress, POTUS. SCOTUS, DoJ, are word
people. So try as they might to match a word account to
the coders and mathematicians, it's pretty well impossible.
And the reverse is true from the techies to the wordies.
Not many hard core cryptographers are persuasive wordies,
so the wordies often run the public show, in the same way
the hard cores runs the labs and hacker blow-outs with
wearable computers and fuzzy PowerPoints of what a
literate person would see as alphanumeric wallpaper.
Keep in mind that even many of the reputable tech reporters
are not all that techie but are adept at using words lifted
from tech drunken orgies. Same in my field of archtecture:
the highly literate architectural critics know squat of the
down and dirty but excell at reaching the public with
artfully simulated accounts burnishing reputations of
marketable greatness.
In the case of NSA, be damn sure that all its heads
knew or know squat about NSA deep tech so they are
suited to move the product in blissful ignorance to
customers of similar know-not. Michael Hayden and Keith
Alexander are perfect for using vapid words to persuade
non-techies as little truth as possible is just fine.
Back to the latest failure to reveal technical docs.
Those who know what's important about them
are not likely to tell journalists that, may be incapable
of doing so in a way that journalists can apply
their vaunted skepticism of sources -- using word
skills of truthiness. So what is transferred are

"Breakthrough" is PR, which might suggest quotation

As head of BT security it is hard to believe that Schneier did not

His NDA with BT would likely prevent disclosing that knowledge
along with protection of his vaunted rep as an incorruptible FOI
Similarly with other notable comsec wizards, the duplicity of
NSA and GCHQ should not be a surprise unless pretense of
surprise is part of the highly rewarding covert cooperation.
Cryptographers are of necessity shady operators, the louder
they profess trustworthiness the more likely not, NSA and
GCHQ role models and dispensers of lucre the role model.
I seem to recall that there is an inverse relationship between
advertized trust and deserved. Modest and quiet cryptographers
have superior ethics over word artists. So a good match
between commercially successful essayists Schneier and
Greenwald. Let the haughty rhetoric gush.
And as Schneier blogs, wise to keep secrets in their pocket(book)s.
And as he demurs to the Guardian and others on why not

What is striking about discussion on the two cryptography mail
lists, both set up to minimize discussing political and social
issues to avoid cypherpunks acceptance of them, is the
tentative reconsideration of those issues due to Snowden's
revelations, miniscule as they are.
Notable among those raising the political threat are those
who disdained the issue on cypherpunks and stomped off
to set up alternatives ham-handedly moderated to cease
and desist the "off-topic."
A few now say, bray more like it, NSA has betrayed us
through political manipulation of officials and the public,
and that is an important point which often came up on
cypherpunks and still does, with somewhat less
complaining about it.
For Snowden has shown the political has won out over
the technical, and the technicals are fraught with what to
do about it, and much fingerpointing is going on along with
a few claims of having forewarned this betrayal would
happen. No moderation yet has shut down this "off-topic."
But much gumming and gnawing of the futility of technical
means against the vulgar political.
What has been shown in the discussion is that the
technical wizards are not nearly as competent at the
messy political as they are at technical sophistication.
The resulting conversation is a mish-mash of fairly
high level technical discourse interleaved with fairly
clumsy political opinionating. So technical clubs
are being swung to answer political jabs, that is
petty squabblling and exchange of slurs has replaced
rational discourse. Thus the convo has become
politicized with as much stupidity and ignorance
as sharp thinking and mutual respect.
NSA and its bosses would be happy if this became
the norm in cryptography as in the real world. And some
opine that this outcome is being, and has been in the
past, and will be in the future, orchestrated for just
that result.
That sounds like what cypherpunks was set up
to combat, the withdrawal from politcial affairs into
safe sanctuary of infallible mathematics coated with
unending challengences to implement illusory
protection from political mayhem. So it has come
to pass, there is no refuge from politics, and the once
reviled tin-hats of conspiracy theories are replacing
anomymous masks, especially by the best and brightest
cryptographers who have been hoodwinked far more
than dreamed of in earliest days of cypherpunks.

Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the world spend more time
chasing and prosecuting voluminous tax cheats then the tiny
number of terrorists. With their contractors this produces handsome
tax revenue, confiscations and fines. Prison populations too.
Spying was invented to catch tax cheats and assure revenue
for government operation and rule, and nothing unites the

security. Imagine a similar one on encryption awaiting disclosure.
Imagine what would replace encryption as the duplicitor of choice.
Then scale up.
Imagine what will replace over-centralized, over-grown, unmanageable

@_subject: The Unbreakable Cipher 
NSA Technical Journal published "The Unbreakable Cipher" in Spring 1961.
David Kahn, "Lyen Otuu Wllwgh WI Etjown" pp. 71, 83, 84, 86,
88 and 90 of the New York Times Magazine November 13, 1960
says that an unbreakable cipher system can be made from one
time key "that is absolutely random and never repeats."  ...
For each cipher system there is an upper bound to the amount of
traffic it can protect against cryptanalytic attack. What is
"cryptanalytic attack"? It is a process applied to cipher text
in order to extract information, especially information
contained in the messages and intended to be kept secret.
If some of the information is gotten by other means and this
results in more being extracted from the cipher, this is (at
least partially) a successful attack. If certain phrases can be
recognized when they are present, this is successful cryptanalysis.
If a priori probabilities on possible contents are altered by
examination of the cipher, this is cryptanalytic progress.
If in making trial decipherments it is possible to pick out
the correct one then cryptanalysis is successful. ...
Another example is that of Mr. Kahn, one-time key. Here the
limit is quite clear; it is the amount of key on hand. The key arrives
in finite "messages," so there is only a finite amount on hand at
anyone time, and this limits the amount of traffic which can be sent
securely. Of course another shipment of key raises this bound, but
technically another cipher system is now in effect, for by my
definition a cipher system is a message. A sequence of messages
is a sequence of cipher systems, related perhaps, but not the same. ...
[Answer to the question:] "Does there exist an unbreakable cipher"
would be this, "Every cipher is breakable, given enough traffic, and
every cipher is unbreakable, if the traffic volume is restricted
[End quote]
Is this conclusion still valid? If so, what could be done to restrict traffic
volume to assure unbreakablility? And how to sufficiently test that.

at all about cryptography produced in 1942 an on-line machine called
TELEKRYPTON. He generated his tapes by pouring a mixture of
metal and glass balls through a hopper, the metal halls alone passing

that it was biased, owing to the heavier weight of the metal balls, and
then changed the respective sizes of the balls to compensate for the

DigiCert's base standard is to use 2048-bit keys in secure SSL certificates - that is enormously stronger than anything Lenstra et al attempted, in fact, it would require factoring a 617-digit number. RSA Labs claim (see:  that 2048-bit keys are 2^32 (2 to the power of 32) times harder to break using NFS, than 1024-bit keys. 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 or almost 4.3 billion, therefore breaking a DigiCert 2048-bit SSL certificate would take about 4.3 billion times longer (using the same standard desktop processing) than doing it for a 1024-bit key. It is therefore estimated, that standard desktop computing power would take 4,294,967,296 x 1.5 million years to break a DigiCert 2048-bit SSL certificate. Or, in other words, a little over 6.4 quadrillion years.
In putting together our video, we estimated the age of the Universe to be 13,751,783,021 years or a little over 13.75 billion years, therefore if you tried to break a DigiCert 2048-bit SSL certificate using a standard modern desktop computer, and you started at the beginning of time, you would have expended 13 billion years of processing by the time you got back to today, and you would still have to repeat that entire process 468,481 times one after the other into our far far distant future before there was a good probability of breaking the certificate. In fact the Universe itself would grow dark before you even got close.

How secure is AES against brute force attacks?
Mohit Arora, Sr. Systems Engineer & Security Architect, Freescale Semiconductor
5/7/2012 05:29 PM EDT
Even with a supercomputer, it would take 1 billion billion years to crack the 128-bit AES key using brute force attack. This is more than the age of the universe (13.75 billion years). If one were to assume that a computing system existed that could recover a DES key in a second, it would still take that same machine approximately 149 trillion years to crack a 128-bit AES key.

The clock is ticking for encryption
The tidy world of cryptography may be upended by the arrival of quantum computers.
By Lamont Wood
March 21, 2011 06:00 AM ET
Today's encryption algorithms can be broken. Their security derives from the wildly impractical lengths of time it can take to do so.
Let's say you're using a 128-bit AES cipher. The number of possible keys with 128 bits is 2 raised to the power of 128, or 3.4x1038, or 340 undecillion. Assuming no information on the nature of the key is available (such as the fact that the owner likes to use his or her children's birthdays), a code-breaking attempt would require testing each possible key until one was found that worked.
Assuming that enough computing power was amassed to test 1 trillion keys per second, testing all possible keys would take 10.79 quintillion years. This is about 785 million times the age of the visible universe (13.75 billion years). On the other hand, you might get lucky in the first 10 minutes.
But using quantum technology with the same throughput, exhausting the possibilities of a 128-bit AES key would take about six months. If a quantum system had to crack a 256-bit key, it would take about as much time as a conventional computer needs to crack a 128-bit key.
A quantum computer could crack a cipher that uses the RSA or EC algorithms almost immediately.

are presented. This is pretty common in such fora as they
age and lazy old-timers put down newbies as if a sport,
shooting fish in a barrel, or as in this instance, flogging a

Occasionally, again as in this instance of critiquing Hidden

Three of those researchers are affiliated with Tor Project

posing and pontificating front for technical inexperience.
Tor Project is more like a sales operation for scientific and

One clue to unreliability is when a former engineer takes over
sales and deploys promotional hyperbole as the principal
marketing tool on fora, at talks, with speeches, articles,
interviews, fund-raisers, documentaries, books, parties,
conferences, 2P2, F2F, debates, all aimed at dominating
a niche.
In Tor Project's case, propaganda for illusory anonymity
has become its main product, as befits an org established
and funded by the USG for that purpose.
Naval Research Laboratory should not be demeaned to
the level of the all too slick Tor Project. And chattering
on Tor fora should not to be confused with substantial

And the reverse is true from the techies to the wordies.
Not many hard core cryptographers are persuasive wordies,
so the wordies often run the public show, in the same way
the hard cores runs the labs and hacker blow-outs with
wearable computers and fuzzy PowerPoints of what a
literate person would see as alphanumeric wallpaper.
Keep in mind that even many of the reputable tech reporters
are not all that techie but are adept at using words lifted
from tech drunken orgies. Same in my field of archtecture:
the highly literate architectural critics know squat of the
down and dirty but excell at reaching the public with
artfully simulated accounts burnishing reputations of
marketable greatness.
In the case of NSA, be damn sure that all its heads
knew or know squat about NSA deep tech so they are
suited to move the product in blissful ignorance to
customers of similar know-not. Michael Hayden and Keith
Alexander are perfect for using vapid words to persuade
non-techies as little truth as possible is just fine.
Back to the latest failure to reveal technical docs.
Those who know what's important about them
are not likely to tell journalists that, may be incapable
of doing so in a way that journalists can apply
their vaunted skepticism of sources -- using word
skills of truthiness. So what is transferred are
narratives, stories, rhetoric, bombast, in lieu of
technical specs, math, algorithms, fabrication
drawings, chemical and electrical formulations,
doses of EM and anti-EM just precisely zapped
to the nano-fullerine /->^256/1029: the myrrh and
honey of technies, sleep-eeze to the wordies
who yawn is that a go or no go to slick brochure
"Breakthrough" is PR, which might suggest quotation
marks around all the NSA revelations -- so far. A long
shot that technical docs will be leaked inadvertently,
maybe left as digital debris inside one of the PowerPoint
files put on a reused thumb drive and recoverable

Thanks for this pointer which leads to Schneier's two reports
in the Guardian about cooperating with Greenwald.
As head of BT security it is hard to believe that Schneier did not
know about BT's covert cooperation with GCHQ and NSA.
His NDA with BT would likely prevent disclosing that knowledge
along with protection of his vaunted rep as an incorruptible FOI
Similarly with other notable comsec wizards, the duplicity of
NSA and GCHQ should not be a surprise unless pretense of
surprise is part of the highly rewarding covert cooperation.
Cryptographers are of necessity shady operators, the louder
they profess trustworthiness the more likely not, NSA and
GCHQ role models and dispensers of lucre the role model.
I seem to recall that there is an inverse relationship between
advertized trust and deserved. Modest and quiet cryptographers
have superior ethics over word artists. So a good match
between commercially successful essayists Schneier and
Greenwald. Let the haughty rhetoric gush.
And as Schneier blogs, wise to keep secrets in their pocket(book)s.
And as he demurs to the Guardian and others on why not
release all the Snowden docs, presumably the docs need careful
vetting to prevent embarassing disclosures of duplicity of
media and comsec wizards, a tradition as old as comsec.

@_subject: Political Cypherpunks Trumps Apolitical Cryptography 
What is striking about discussion on the two cryptography mail
lists, both set up to minimize discussing political and social
issues to avoid cypherpunks acceptance of them, is the
tentative reconsideration of those issues due to Snowden's
revelations, miniscule as they are.
Notable among those raising the political threat are those
who disdained the issue on cypherpunks and stomped off
to set up alternatives ham-handedly moderated to cease
and desist the "off-topic."
A few now say, bray more like it, NSA has betrayed us
through political manipulation of officials and the public,
and that is an important point which often came up on
cypherpunks and still does, with somewhat less
complaining about it.
For Snowden has shown the political has won out over
the technical, and the technicals are fraught with what to
do about it, and much fingerpointing is going on along with
a few claims of having forewarned this betrayal would
happen. No moderation yet has shut down this "off-topic."
But much gumming and gnawing of the futility of technical
means against the vulgar political.
What has been shown in the discussion is that the
technical wizards are not nearly as competent at the
messy political as they are at technical sophistication.
The resulting conversation is a mish-mash of fairly
high level technical discourse interleaved with fairly
clumsy political opinionating. So technical clubs
are being swung to answer political jabs, that is
petty squabblling and exchange of slurs has replaced
rational discourse. Thus the convo has become
politicized with as much stupidity and ignorance
as sharp thinking and mutual respect.
NSA and its bosses would be happy if this became
the norm in cryptography as in the real world. And some
opine that this outcome is being, and has been in the
past, and will be in the future, orchestrated for just
that result.
That sounds like what cypherpunks was set up
to combat, the withdrawal from politcial affairs into
safe sanctuary of infallible mathematics coated with
unending challengences to implement illusory
protection from political mayhem. So it has come
to pass, there is no refuge from politics, and the once
reviled tin-hats of conspiracy theories are replacing
anomymous masks, especially by the best and brightest
cryptographers who have been hoodwinked far more
than dreamed of in earliest days of cypherpunks.
Still, there are die-hard PR-driven comsec experts
rolling out advice for what to do to protect the public --
meaning, cynically protecting their severely damaged
reputation of "concern for the public interest (R)".
Not yet willing to admit losing the comsec and privacy

O Globo videos show glimpses of slides which are then
further redacted or cropped for release as slides alone.
Schneier claims to be working with Greenwald so he is
presumably seeing full views of docs and slides. Yet he
sustains a steady beat of surprise and outrage, almost
as if overly defensive about who knows what.
Greenwald has tweeted that there are legal reasons to
not show full views nor "distribute" document instead only

May it be true the spies admit defeat. But not likely, more likely
a ruse, for they are highly trained liars and tricksters. Feints are
commonplace to disarm and delude opponents.
Pardons of Manning and Snowden, shutdown investigating
of Assange, and several other intimidating and chilling
operations would be persuasive. Hearings on abuse would
help air the stench. But will not eliminate the rot of secrecy.
These formulaic conciliatory gestures would be cheap discounts
of giant budgets for ancient practices of extorting money from
the public, for, what else, protection, protection against
government defined threats, identified by secret means.
The spying apparatus will re-surge as it has forever, governments
cannot survive without spying on its taxpayers. IRS and global
revenue agencies the main data collectors on citizens and subjects
from birth to death for everyone everywhere, even spies. SSN the
ubiquitous UID. Got a problem with that, go to jail. Tax refusers and
evaders more stigmatized and loathed than terrorists.
Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the world spend more time
chasing and prosecuting voluminous tax cheats then the tiny
number of terrorists. With their contractors this produces handsome
tax revenue, confiscations and fines. Prison populations too.
Spying was invented to catch tax cheats and assure revenue
for government operation and rule, and nothing unites the
world's governments more than that essential transfusion
of money to sustain government beneficiares, in the US the
three branches, state and local. Military merely cops to
control obedient payment.
In NYC, the racket of Wall Street is to pay NYPD to stay
away from finance through the Police Foundation. The

David Cohen, formerly CIA Director of Operations, who
has set a completely unaccountable spying operation.

NSA Technical Journal published "The Unbreakable Cipher" in Spring 1961.
David Kahn, "Lyen Otuu Wllwgh WI Etjown" pp. 71, 83, 84, 86,
88 and 90 of the New York Times Magazine November 13, 1960
says that an unbreakable cipher system can be made from one
time key "that is absolutely random and never repeats."  ...
For each cipher system there is an upper bound to the amount of
traffic it can protect against cryptanalytic attack. What is
"cryptanalytic attack"? It is a process applied to cipher text
in order to extract information, especially information
contained in the messages and intended to be kept secret.
If some of the information is gotten by other means and this
results in more being extracted from the cipher, this is (at
least partially) a successful attack. If certain phrases can be
recognized when they are present, this is successful cryptanalysis.
If a priori probabilities on possible contents are altered by
examination of the cipher, this is cryptanalytic progress.
If in making trial decipherments it is possible to pick out
the correct one then cryptanalysis is successful. ...
Another example is that of Mr. Kahn, one-time key. Here the
limit is quite clear; it is the amount of key on hand. The key arrives
in finite "messages," so there is only a finite amount on hand at
anyone time, and this limits the amount of traffic which can be sent
securely. Of course another shipment of key raises this bound, but
technically another cipher system is now in effect, for by my
definition a cipher system is a message. A sequence of messages
is a sequence of cipher systems, related perhaps, but not the same. ...
[Answer to the question:] "Does there exist an unbreakable cipher"
would be this, "Every cipher is breakable, given enough traffic, and
every cipher is unbreakable, if the traffic volume is restricted
[End quote]
Is this conclusion still valid? If so, what could be done to restrict traffic
volume to assure unbreakablility? And how to sufficiently test that.

British intelligence organization in New York who knew nothing
at all about cryptography produced in 1942 an on-line machine called
TELEKRYPTON. He generated his tapes by pouring a mixture of
metal and glass balls through a hopper, the metal halls alone passing
current and perforating 5-level tape. He analyzed the result and saw
that it was biased, owing to the heavier weight of the metal balls, and
then changed the respective sizes of the balls to compensate for the
extra weight of the metal."

@_subject: Eccentricity: How Hard to Crack a Cryptosystem 
One of the many eccentricities of crypto is speculating on how
long and how much computing power would be needed to crack
a particular cryptosystem, its algorithm or "implementation."
A favorite of popular writing on the topic, it is likely these
claims are pure fiction fabricated to satisfy headlines and
deadlines -- and, as always, to market or rididule a competitor's
piece of shit.
No Wikipedia entry on the phrase "crypto implementation,"
the all-time favorite excuse for the shit's absolute certain failure.
Some examples among hundreds:
No. 1

DigiCert's base standard is to use 2048-bit keys in secure SSL certificates - that is enormously stronger than anything Lenstra et al attempted, in fact, it would require factoring a 617-digit number. RSA Labs claim (see:  that 2048-bit keys are 2^32 (2 to the power of 32) times harder to break using NFS, than 1024-bit keys. 2^32 = 4,294,967,296 or almost 4.3 billion, therefore breaking a DigiCert 2048-bit SSL certificate would take about 4.3 billion times longer (using the same standard desktop processing) than doing it for a 1024-bit key. It is therefore estimated, that standard desktop computing power would take 4,294,967,296 x 1.5 million years to break a DigiCert 2048-bit SSL certificate. Or, in other words, a little over 6.4 quadrillion years.
In putting together our video, we estimated the age of the Universe to be 13,751,783,021 years or a little over 13.75 billion years, therefore if you tried to break a DigiCert 2048-bit SSL certificate using a standard modern desktop computer, and you started at the beginning of time, you would have expended 13 billion years of processing by the time you got back to today, and you would still have to repeat that entire process 468,481 times one after the other into our far far distant future before there was a good probability of breaking the certificate. In fact the Universe itself would grow dark before you even got close.

How secure is AES against brute force attacks?
Mohit Arora, Sr. Systems Engineer & Security Architect, Freescale Semiconductor
5/7/2012 05:29 PM EDT
Even with a supercomputer, it would take 1 billion billion years to crack the 128-bit AES key using brute force attack. This is more than the age of the universe (13.75 billion years). If one were to assume that a computing system existed that could recover a DES key in a second, it would still take that same machine approximately 149 trillion years to crack a 128-bit AES key.

The clock is ticking for encryption
The tidy world of cryptography may be upended by the arrival of quantum computers.
By Lamont Wood
March 21, 2011 06:00 AM ET
Today's encryption algorithms can be broken. Their security derives from the wildly impractical lengths of time it can take to do so.
Let's say you're using a 128-bit AES cipher. The number of possible keys with 128 bits is 2 raised to the power of 128, or 3.4x1038, or 340 undecillion. Assuming no information on the nature of the key is available (such as the fact that the owner likes to use his or her children's birthdays), a code-breaking attempt would require testing each possible key until one was found that worked.
Assuming that enough computing power was amassed to test 1 trillion keys per second, testing all possible keys would take 10.79 quintillion years. This is about 785 million times the age of the visible universe (13.75 billion years). On the other hand, you might get lucky in the first 10 minutes.
But using quantum technology with the same throughput, exhausting the possibilities of a 128-bit AES key would take about six months. If a quantum system had to crack a 256-bit key, it would take about as much time as a conventional computer needs to crack a 128-bit key.
A quantum computer could crack a cipher that uses the RSA or EC algorithms almost immediately.

Computers and networks are small pieces compared to
where they housed, bunkered, trenched, drowned, aired,
emitted, lofted, arrayed, hidden. Those structures of the
infrastructure are as costly as the human power and
much greater in scope and necessity -- and immensely
targetable thanks to ostentatious appurtenances of antennas,
fences, barriers, sensors, stand-offs, chopper pads,
cafes, health and environmental inspections, power lines
and sub-stations, and not least loose lips of contractors

We know the location of some of the principal offices and
HQs, but those are misleading icons, as much ruses as
as leaked budget tables, congrats for those teasing
leads BTW.
Specifics may be withheld to "protect operations and lives"

This is the achilles heel of the Snowden drop. PowerPoint,
Photoshop and redactions coutured in editorial elaboration of
documents not revealed is exactly what officials do to
spin material and manipulate the public.
The Snowden material needs an untethered, unchoked,
and unmarionetted leaker not more commercial journalism
dribbling what, unforntunately has become common in the
"era of WikiLeaks journalism," is disinfo. And implies the
prospect of complicity with authorities under rigging of
privileged journalism and coddled D-Noticers.
The Guardian has belatedly confessed to that. And WaPo
and the NYT have they have and will vet Snowden material
with the USG before release. Which suggests cotinuation
of a lot more editorial elaboration, TV garavitasing, bowdlerized
reports and articles, Dough-Boy books, Op X films, primly
steriolized documentaries. In effect, a propaganda push
right out of the 1950s through the 2010s configured for
cyberwar coldwar. Manchurian Assange, Manning, Snowden
featured a la Zizek in the Guardian yesterday.

is a long tradition of authorities, their covert agents and
provocateurs manipulating their citizenry, consumers, fans,

No doubt the game advances the interests of all the games players
so long as they follow their agreed upon rules and cheat very
carefully. We may admire their skill and daring and triumphs but
the rules state we are not qualified to be the players, that requires
ranking by authorities of the game.
Assange was once not a player, studied hard, watched the masters,
now he is surrounded by grand masterful players and reaps the
rewards of fame, acclaim, and happily the monetary prizes, to
be sure spending a lot of that on lawyers and promoters. So
it goes.
Meanwhile there is a need for more undoctored documents
for the newbies and bystanders angling for a chance, for
consumers to see what happens offstage, how vetting and
redacting, parceling and censoring is done.
But Assange and cohorts have become secretive about the
WikiLeaks operation and apparently (who knows) hidden
stashes of income, in concert with the practices of secretkeepers
of all stripes.
And not least WL engages in defamation to an almost hysterical

@_subject: Tor Project Fora Critique 
Tor Project discussion lists have become characterized by a
a tone of dismissiveness, knee-jerkedness, when critiques
are presented. This is pretty common in such fora as they
age and lazy old-timers put down newbies as if a sport,
shooting fish in a barrel, or as in this instance, flogging a
dead horse.
Occasionally, again as in this instance of critiquing Hidden
Services, a thoughtful response is provided rather than a
putdown. The more experienced Tor contributors are not
as susceptible to putdowns as the middling and bottomers,
certainly not as offensive as the Tor Project promoters,
funders and fans.
It would be helpful to distinguish between those who know
onion-routing in depth and those who advocate its use
with what often appears to be primarily public relations and
advertizing disdain toward critics and inquirers.
Reviewing the depth of research at the Naval Research Laboratory
on network security and anonymization indicates that serious
research has been done long before Tor Project appeared.
Three of those researchers are affiliated with Tor Project
and keep it from being dubious flim-flammery in which
posing and pontificating front for technical inexperience.
Tor Project is more like a sales operation for scientific and
engineering endeavors. And in that role it boosts and promotes,
sounding sometimes like snake oil, another overused cliche,
than the skeptical and inquiring research at scientists and
engineers at the NRL.
Tor fora suffer the same consequences as this one, producing
mostly shallow bullshit, mea culpa, with occasional leads for
pursuing offline endeavors requiring much time for lasting
Chat and mail lists, like reader comments and polls, have
become promotional gimmicks, run by PR hustlers with
about as much knowledge of discussion topics as
salespeople usually have.
One clue to unreliability is when a former engineer takes over
sales and deploys promotional hyperbole as the principal
marketing tool on fora, at talks, with speeches, articles,
interviews, fund-raisers, documentaries, books, parties,
conferences, 2P2, F2F, debates, all aimed at dominating
a niche.
In Tor Project's case, propaganda for illusory anonymity
has become its main product, as befits an org established
and funded by the USG for that purpose.
Naval Research Laboratory should not be demeaned to
the level of the all too slick Tor Project. And chattering
on Tor fora should not to be confused with substantial
contributions to helping protect the non-technical public
from technical exploitation by sales and advertising

dual-use, dual-purpose, duplicity. Layered security

More words from a non-techie:
David Kahn, James Bamford, Seymour Hersh and quite
a few NSA and other spy types, in particular heads of
agencies, Congress, POTUS. SCOTUS, DoJ, are word
people. So try as they might to match a word account to
the coders and mathematicians, it's pretty well impossible.
And the reverse is true from the techies to the wordies.
Not many hard core cryptographers are persuasive wordies,
so the wordies often run the public show, in the same way
the hard cores runs the labs and hacker blow-outs with
wearable computers and fuzzy PowerPoints of what a
literate person would see as alphanumeric wallpaper.
Keep in mind that even many of the reputable tech reporters
are not all that techie but are adept at using words lifted
from tech drunken orgies. Same in my field of archtecture:
the highly literate architectural critics know squat of the
down and dirty but excell at reaching the public with
artfully simulated accounts burnishing reputations of
marketable greatness.
In the case of NSA, be damn sure that all its heads
knew or know squat about NSA deep tech so they are
suited to move the product in blissful ignorance to
customers of similar know-not. Michael Hayden and Keith
Alexander are perfect for using vapid words to persuade
non-techies as little truth as possible is just fine.
Back to the latest failure to reveal technical docs.
Those who know what's important about them
are not likely to tell journalists that, may be incapable
of doing so in a way that journalists can apply
their vaunted skepticism of sources -- using word
skills of truthiness. So what is transferred are
narratives, stories, rhetoric, bombast, in lieu of
technical specs, math, algorithms, fabrication

"Breakthrough" is PR, which might suggest quotation
marks around all the NSA revelations -- so far. A long
shot that technical docs will be leaked inadvertently,
maybe left as digital debris inside one of the PowerPoint
files put on a reused thumb drive and recoverable
in a filthy techie lab. I think Ross Anderson could siphon

Thanks for this pointer which leads to Schneier's two reports

As head of BT security it is hard to believe that Schneier did not
know about BT's covert cooperation with GCHQ and NSA.
His NDA with BT would likely prevent disclosing that knowledge
along with protection of his vaunted rep as an incorruptible FOI
Similarly with other notable comsec wizards, the duplicity of
NSA and GCHQ should not be a surprise unless pretense of
surprise is part of the highly rewarding covert cooperation.
Cryptographers are of necessity shady operators, the louder
they profess trustworthiness the more likely not, NSA and
GCHQ role models and dispensers of lucre the role model.
I seem to recall that there is an inverse relationship between
advertized trust and deserved. Modest and quiet cryptographers
have superior ethics over word artists. So a good match
between commercially successful essayists Schneier and
Greenwald. Let the haughty rhetoric gush.
And as Schneier blogs, wise to keep secrets in their pocket(book)s.
And as he demurs to the Guardian and others on why not
release all the Snowden docs, presumably the docs need careful
vetting to prevent embarassing disclosures of duplicity of

What is striking about discussion on the two cryptography mail
lists, both set up to minimize discussing political and social
issues to avoid cypherpunks acceptance of them, is the
tentative reconsideration of those issues due to Snowden's
revelations, miniscule as they are.
Notable among those raising the political threat are those
who disdained the issue on cypherpunks and stomped off
to set up alternatives ham-handedly moderated to cease
and desist the "off-topic."
A few now say, bray more like it, NSA has betrayed us
through political manipulation of officials and the public,
and that is an important point which often came up on
cypherpunks and still does, with somewhat less
complaining about it.
For Snowden has shown the political has won out over
the technical, and the technicals are fraught with what to
do about it, and much fingerpointing is going on along with
a few claims of having forewarned this betrayal would
happen. No moderation yet has shut down this "off-topic."
But much gumming and gnawing of the futility of technical
means against the vulgar political.
What has been shown in the discussion is that the
technical wizards are not nearly as competent at the
messy political as they are at technical sophistication.
The resulting conversation is a mish-mash of fairly
high level technical discourse interleaved with fairly
clumsy political opinionating. So technical clubs
are being swung to answer political jabs, that is
petty squabblling and exchange of slurs has replaced
rational discourse. Thus the convo has become
politicized with as much stupidity and ignorance
as sharp thinking and mutual respect.
NSA and its bosses would be happy if this became
the norm in cryptography as in the real world. And some
opine that this outcome is being, and has been in the
past, and will be in the future, orchestrated for just
that result.
That sounds like what cypherpunks was set up
to combat, the withdrawal from politcial affairs into
safe sanctuary of infallible mathematics coated with
unending challengences to implement illusory
protection from political mayhem. So it has come
to pass, there is no refuge from politics, and the once
reviled tin-hats of conspiracy theories are replacing
anomymous masks, especially by the best and brightest
cryptographers who have been hoodwinked far more
than dreamed of in earliest days of cypherpunks.

commonplace to disarm and delude opponents.
Pardons of Manning and Snowden, shutdown investigating
of Assange, and several other intimidating and chilling

These formulaic conciliatory gestures would be cheap discounts
of giant budgets for ancient practices of extorting money from
the public, for, what else, protection, protection against
government defined threats, identified by secret means.
The spying apparatus will re-surge as it has forever, governments
cannot survive without spying on its taxpayers. IRS and global
revenue agencies the main data collectors on citizens and subjects
from birth to death for everyone everywhere, even spies. SSN the
ubiquitous UID. Got a problem with that, go to jail. Tax refusers and
evaders more stigmatized and loathed than terrorists.
Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the world spend more time
chasing and prosecuting voluminous tax cheats then the tiny
number of terrorists. With their contractors this produces handsome
tax revenue, confiscations and fines. Prison populations too.
Spying was invented to catch tax cheats and assure revenue
for government operation and rule, and nothing unites the
world's governments more than that essential transfusion
of money to sustain government beneficiares, in the US the
three branches, state and local. Military merely cops to
control obedient payment.

Recall NSA's 1997 paper on the inevitable failure of computer
security. Imagine a similar one on encryption awaiting disclosure.
Imagine what would replace encryption as the duplicitor of choice.
Then scale up.
Imagine what will replace over-centralized, over-grown, unmanageable
NSA and its mushrooming gaga'd critics. Not DIRNSAs retiring to

not spooning bits of spy feces into yawning mouths of readers.
Then scale down to non-secret means and methods accessible
to everyone. Even the end of official spying and its inevitable
corruption of government by out of control secrecy and dependency

NSA Technical Journal published "The Unbreakable Cipher" in Spring 1961.
David Kahn, "Lyen Otuu Wllwgh WI Etjown" pp. 71, 83, 84, 86,
88 and 90 of the New York Times Magazine November 13, 1960
says that an unbreakable cipher system can be made from one
time key "that is absolutely random and never repeats."  ...
For each cipher system there is an upper bound to the amount of
traffic it can protect against cryptanalytic attack. What is
"cryptanalytic attack"? It is a process applied to cipher text
in order to extract information, especially information
contained in the messages and intended to be kept secret.
If some of the information is gotten by other means and this
results in more being extracted from the cipher, this is (at
least partially) a successful attack. If certain phrases can be
recognized when they are present, this is successful cryptanalysis.
If a priori probabilities on possible contents are altered by
examination of the cipher, this is cryptanalytic progress.
If in making trial decipherments it is possible to pick out
the correct one then cryptanalysis is successful. ...
Another example is that of Mr. Kahn, one-time key. Here the
limit is quite clear; it is the amount of key on hand. The key arrives
in finite "messages," so there is only a finite amount on hand at
anyone time, and this limits the amount of traffic which can be sent
securely. Of course another shipment of key raises this bound, but
technically another cipher system is now in effect, for by my
definition a cipher system is a message. A sequence of messages
is a sequence of cipher systems, related perhaps, but not the same. ...
[Answer to the question:] "Does there exist an unbreakable cipher"
would be this, "Every cipher is breakable, given enough traffic, and
every cipher is unbreakable, if the traffic volume is restricted
[End quote]
Is this conclusion still valid? If so, what could be done to restrict traffic
volume to assure unbreakablility? And how to sufficiently test that.

British intelligence organization in New York who knew nothing
at all about cryptography produced in 1942 an on-line machine called
TELEKRYPTON. He generated his tapes by pouring a mixture of
metal and glass balls through a hopper, the metal halls alone passing
current and perforating 5-level tape. He analyzed the result and saw
that it was biased, owing to the heavier weight of the metal balls, and
then changed the respective sizes of the balls to compensate for the
extra weight of the metal."

The CIA is the principal customer of NSA products outside
the military. When global cyber spying Cybercom was proposed
NSA did not want to do it, claiming it exceeded NSA's military
mission. However, the pols, and CIA, wanted that very excess,
in particular for spying inside the US, ostensibly banned for the
CIA but now needed for terrorists inside.
CIA (long FBI opponents) thought FBI could not cope with inside
terrorists, using 9/11 as an example, and advocated NSA involvement
with its much greater technical capability, but more importantly, its
military-privileged secrecy not susceptible to full congressional
oversight, courts and FOIA.
The joint CIA-NSA Special Collection Service (SCS) has
been doing for decades what NSA is now alone accused of doing:
CIA provided the targets, NSA did the technical collection from
those global stations identified by xKeyscore (most in embassies
or nearby).
What is bizarre is how little CIA is mentioned in news furor about
NSA, as if NSA did its work in isolation from the IC and without
oversight of the 3 branches.
SCS also does burglaries, code snatches, decrypts, doc drops,
stings, ploys, blackmail, the panoply of CIA operations. The increased
civilian target panoply bestowed upon NSA came from CIA demands
channeled through ODNI.
Reviewing what little has been released of the Snowden documents
they are quite similar to what SCS has been doing with the addition
of the US as target. FISA had to be rejiggered for the US domain.
Most national leaders, like POTUS, are considered to be military
commanders thus fair game for NSA along with CIA. Nothing
exceptional about the recent revelations of spying on chiefs of
NSA technical collection capability was developed for the
military, not civilian use. Now expanded to CIA full dominance
territory. FISA had to be rejiggered for using it against civilians.
And is still being rejiggered these days.
NSA's recent attempt to slough off Cybercom and return to
its military mission, has been rejected by the civilian overseers
following CIA guidance and fear-mongering of civilians, especially
those inside the US. The last thing CIA and its supporters want
is a revelation of its manipulation of civilian leaders institutionalized
by the 1947 National Security Act (also opposed by the military).

CIA (long FBI opponents) thought FBI could not cope with inside
terrorists, using 9/11 as an example, and advocated NSA involvement
with its much greater technical capability, but more importantly, its
military-privileged secrecy not susceptible to full congressional
oversight, courts and FOIA.
The joint CIA-NSA Special Collection Service (SCS) has
been doing for decades what NSA is now alone accused of doing:
CIA provided the targets, NSA did the technical collection from
those global stations identified by xKeyscore (most in embassies
or nearby).
What is bizarre is how little CIA is mentioned in news furor about
NSA, as if NSA did its work in isolation from the IC and without
oversight of the 3 branches.
SCS also does burglaries, code snatches, decrypts, doc drops,
stings, ploys, blackmail, the panoply of CIA operations. The increased
civilian target panoply bestowed upon NSA came from CIA demands
channeled through ODNI.
Reviewing what little has been released of the Snowden documents
they are quite similar to what SCS has been doing with the addition
of the US as target. FISA had to be rejiggered for the US domain.
Most national leaders, like POTUS, are considered to be military
commanders thus fair game for NSA along with CIA. Nothing
exceptional about the recent revelations of spying on chiefs of
NSA technical collection capability was developed for the
military, not civilian use. Now expanded to CIA full dominance
territory. FISA had to be rejiggered for using it against civilians.
And is still being rejiggered these days.
NSA's recent attempt to slough off Cybercom and return to
its military mission, has been rejected by the civilian overseers
following CIA guidance and fear-mongering of civilians, especially
those inside the US. The last thing CIA and its supporters want
is a revelation of its manipulation of civilian leaders institutionalized
by the 1947 National Security Act (also opposed by the military).

Stone's is a good statement which correctly places responsibility
on three-branch policy and oversight of NSA, a military unit obliged
to obey command of civilians however bizarre and politically self-serving.
ODNI and NSA have been inviting a series of critics and journalists
to discussions. Most have resulted in statements similar to
Stone's. No such discussions were held after 9/11.
Incorrect to compare NSA to rogue, dirty work, civilian-led CIA
which will attack the three branches if riled. That is the blackmail
looming since 1947.
Greater public oversight of the three-branches is needed, for they
are the rogue, dirty work, civilian-led three LS, protecty by highest
If this can be helped by these invited discussions and statements,
that would be a true advance beyond mere futile debate so far
generated by shallow journalisitic reporting and polemics.
Release of far more of Snowden's documents will be needed
for this to happen, hopefully the whole wad by a means that will
put the technology in the hands of those who can understand
it. So far, the journalists have released only the most useful
to arouse indignation and refuse to release what could make
a lasting difference. Not that journalists should be expected

Cryptome does not pretend to provide illusory security, that is security.
It is a vile, rotten, corrupt endeavor, like life. Chuckle.
Visitors, readers, consumers must be skeptical of security, and not rely
upon security promoters, their followers and investors who exploit
dependency by fear uncertainty and doubt.
Skepticism of security claims and methods is one of the purposes of
these lists. Perhaps the main purpose, although it is commonplace for
these lists to be used for soliciting befuddled consumers to hop aboard
the gravy train. Now and then skeptcism of the security arises but is usually
suppressed during times of crisis when incentive is rich to promote poor
products and services. Governments, commerce, orgs, experts cooperate
to foster crises under guise of opposition.
This applies to all forms of security, safety, protection, defense, hygienic
Still, Cryptome endorses the continuing struggle to improve citizen
protection, not only as a job, career, industry, but as citizens' obligation
to bear responsibility for the commonweal against its inside and outside
enemies, if you will, common math against the deadly germs.
One way to do that is to not oversell it, tone down the threats, reduce
drumbeating, avoid hyperbole for and against, forego advertising,
gang-bang hectoring, circle jerk conferencing, TEDing, prize bestowing,
to quietly invent, improve, critique, test, apply, re-test often, expect to
be deceived by colleagues witting or unwitting, especially by sales,
politicians, authoritarians -- the persistent germs.

Good to see the report on Target's penetration through its remote
heating and cooling controls. These and a slew of other building
automation systems are often run on central computers along with
data processing. Data processing may be protected but the other
systems often are not, for IT sec tends to focus on the data of
businesses housed in a structure but not the systems running or
monitoring the structure with its operating systems most often
overseen by maintenance and operation staff seldom skilled
in cybersec.
We have seen quite a few buildings with decent data protection and
building physical and electronic security systems, but lacking oversight
of the security of building automation systems often remote from
the facilities with 24x7 access, and from there who knows where
else -- central automation firms may link up to hundreds of other
buildings in a batch of countries. Critical infrastructure protection
seldom covers the great variety of buildings.
Some use the same Internet connection, separated only
by software and folders, with folders of the automation system in
obscure locations seldom seen by principal IT data admins.
Different duties, contracts, staff, budgets. Much interest in
data security, hardly any for automation security.
This is not the case for experienced designers, constructors
and operators of buildings. Although compartmentalization
among them continues to erect easy to penetrate "firewalls"

@_subject: [cryptography] To Protect and Infect Slides 
Jake's, Assange's and others' emphasis at 30c3 was to pursue
technological offenses rather than futile expectation of political,
financial and legal controls of spying which inevitably confirm
what spies do, for it is in their interest to support spyin and
secrecy to maintain hegemonic, heirarchial institutions under
"the rule of law."
Reminder, at the origin of cypherpunks there was a crackdown
on encryption as a munitions. That skirmish was thought to
have been won. Now Snowden has revealed that victory
was a delusion, the real one-sided battle was fought
surreptiously in secret, not only by contaminating crypto
but by development of bypasses, implants, backdoors,
booby traps, ruses, scams, bribes, dual-hatted contracts
with crypto-hackers.
Can an openly avowed combat on the technologies of political
control (1) work or will it be demonized, fought by secret
underhanded means? Public debate deployed as a ruse in
the 1990s as now.
(1) An Appraisal of the Technologies of Political Control
This combat is about far more than crypto and coders must
be supplemented with all the discplines of science and
technology which are now serving industry and the
"lawful" hegemons.
30c3 advocated a direct attack on these means, not wait for
the public debate to be rigged in favor of the hegemon with
PR, propaganda, lobbying, bribery, contracts, scare stories,
terrifying incidents, the customary dirty fighting and tricks of
spies and "defense" industry.
Is that technological attack on the political, financial, legal
hegemon likely to succeed? Or will the crackdown on
armed (technological) dissent become as violent as it has
in the past?
There is a likelihood encryption will be restricted, by fiat,
by planting weaknesses, by covert attacks, by technological
bypasses, by rigged failures to create doubt of effectiveness.
That was the way CryptoAG operation was run. Now the RSA
ploy is operative. Is the effect of Snowden to be a series
of ploys and ruses. Worse, hop on board the paranoia train,
is Snowden a disinfo op for leaking gobs of ruses?
A singular feature of hegemons is that they are dominated by
"self-regulating organizations" which set the terms and conditions
of the ruling entity, assure enforcement of the rules, and perpetuate
themselves under "self-regulation."
These are successors of royalty which instead of divine right,
backed by military power, they invoke the "Constitution," a law
which distinctively empowers "lawful" behavior according to the
rules of the hegemon.
No wonder the US promotes constitutional government around
the planet, backed by military power, most often by denigrating
other forms of government.
A striking parallel is the rise of the clerics in Europe as an alternative

The Swartz situation was more complicated than the prinicipal
legal parties involved. A comprehensive legal attack implicated
a slew of people and institutions in Aaron's circle, some who were
frightened into pulling away from him, some of who were forced to
testify much to their later shame and embarassment when that was
made public.
It is not unusual for supporters to run from the scene when pressure
comes down through federal investigators digging into private
affairs, intimidating witnesses, friends and familiies with fruits of
those findings, turning poeple against each other, bamboozling
journalists and publishers who pretend opposition to authority.
Swartz's case parallels what happened to Jim Bell, and to Carl
Prosecutors are highly adept at creating fear in supporters with
grand jury subpoenas for evidence and closed testimony, then
later subpoenaed for trial. This was done with several cypherpunks,
me among them.
During two trials and his imprisonment not a few cypherpunks
came down on Jim Bell, cowardly sorry motherfuckers, some
of them once admired for courage, shown to be candyasses
out to avoid risk beyond rhetoric (as with Manning and Snowden).
Not a few came down on Aaron Swarz, cowardly sorry motherfuckers,
some of them still lamenting the loss of a brave man while hiding
their abandonment of him, stigmatizing his loss of adorableness, his
loss of lovers, true friends and supporters, his lonely withdrawal from
social affairs, his hiding inside his apartment pondering the rest of
his life betrayed by those blaming him for their chickenshitedness.
Swartz died more likely murder, enforced suicide, a killing by
officials and those unable to match Aaron's bravery.
Jim Bell and Carl Johnson were not so easily buffaloed. Although
there continues to be bountiful cowardly motherfuckers who fucked
them as was Manning, as were the Anonymous 16, and will likely be
Snowden, led by the media which takes no chances beyond
rhetoric and hypebole.

If your server or ISP generates log files, as all do, you cannot
be secure. If upstream servers generate log files, as all do,
you cannot be secure. If local, regional, national and international
servers generate log files, as all do, you cannot be secure.
So long as log files are ubiquitous on the Internet, no one can
be secure.
Log files are the fundamental weakness of the Internet
because system administrators claim the Internet cannot
be managed and maintained without them.
This is not true, it is merely an urban legend to conceal
the interests of system administrators and their customers
to exploit Internet user data.
There is no fundamental need for log files, except to
perpetuate the other urban legend, privacy policy, which
conceals the abuse of log files by web site operators
and their cooperation with "lawful" orders to reveal
user data, most often by being paid to reveal that
data to authorities, to sponsors, to funders, to
advertisers, to scholars, to private investigators,
to inside and outside lawyers, to serial cohorts,
cartels and combines, to providers and purchasers
of web sites, to educators of cyber employees,
to courts, to cybersecurity firms, to journalists, to
anybody who has the slightest justification to exploit

Logs needed run the Internet steadily, securely and cheaply

exploitive and very lucrative spying on users. This is why there
are thousands of firms providing log files exploitation programs
and services. Every product manufacturer touts its spying
capabilities through innocent sounding "log files" ostensibly
serving administrative purpose but then just below that claim
are the burgeoning other uses of maximizing profits.
Log files are metadata of the Internet, the tip of a giant
iceberg of metadata. This is the dirty secret, the family
jewels, of the Internet, carefully rationalized and guarded
by sysadmins. Sysadmins have become the traitors, or
patriots, of the Internet. Traitors against the public, patriots

a cover for the huge industry which goes right through that

Thanks. We posted the Wassenaar changes on Cryptome

The intrusion software has received some but not sufficient
attention. And beyond the sections you cite there are many
covering other technologies which interrelate and affect crypto.
Those have received even less attention, at least in crypto
world as far as we have seen.
The means to transceive crypto continue to be its Achilles
heel and appear headed toward crippling the whole body -- the
bubble in which crypto exists precariously dependent on
sophisticated support systems which, as seen in the Snowden
minimal releases, have overwhelmed public crypto security, not
least by leaving the impression public crypto was highly effective.
More attention to the support system presumably will be given
as the Snowden releases recommence, now dead stopped.
Greenwald claimed recently  that cryptographers and other
techies are now reviewing the material, much of which is
beyond the capabilities of journalists, lawyers and politicians.
The stumbling block of comprehensive Snowden disclosures
is that to do so, allegedly, could severely damage national security.
Uh oh, that terrible aroma of complicity to protect secrets
too dangerous for the public to know. Instead a few select experts
are allowed to perfomr dual-hat assessments. Which is what has led
to the current imbroglio of public and expert distrust: who watches

Jake's, Assange's and others' emphasis at 30c3 was to pursue
technological offenses rather than futile expectation of political,
financial and legal controls of spying which inevitably confirm
what spies do, for it is in their interest to support spyin and
secrecy to maintain hegemonic, heirarchial institutions under
"the rule of law."
Reminder, at the origin of cypherpunks there was a crackdown
on encryption as a munitions. That skirmish was thought to
have been won. Now Snowden has revealed that victory
was a delusion, the real one-sided battle was fought
surreptiously in secret, not only by contaminating crypto
but by development of bypasses, implants, backdoors,
booby traps, ruses, scams, bribes, dual-hatted contracts
with crypto-hackers.
Can an openly avowed combat on the technologies of political
control (1) work or will it be demonized, fought by secret
underhanded means? Public debate deployed as a ruse in
the 1990s as now.
(1) An Appraisal of the Technologies of Political Control
This combat is about far more than crypto and coders must
be supplemented with all the discplines of science and
technology which are now serving industry and the
"lawful" hegemons.
30c3 advocated a direct attack on these means, not wait for
the public debate to be rigged in favor of the hegemon with
PR, propaganda, lobbying, bribery, contracts, scare stories,
terrifying incidents, the customary dirty fighting and tricks of
spies and "defense" industry.
Is that technological attack on the political, financial, legal
hegemon likely to succeed? Or will the crackdown on
armed (technological) dissent become as violent as it has
in the past?
There is a likelihood encryption will be restricted, by fiat,
by planting weaknesses, by covert attacks, by technological
bypasses, by rigged failures to create doubt of effectiveness.
That was the way CryptoAG operation was run. Now the RSA
ploy is operative. Is the effect of Snowden to be a series
of ploys and ruses. Worse, hop on board the paranoia train,
is Snowden a disinfo op for leaking gobs of ruses?
A singular feature of hegemons is that they are dominated by
"self-regulating organizations" which set the terms and conditions
of the ruling entity, assure enforcement of the rules, and perpetuate
themselves under "self-regulation."
These are successors of royalty which instead of divine right,
backed by military power, they invoke the "Constitution," a law
which distinctively empowers "lawful" behavior according to the
rules of the hegemon.
No wonder the US promotes constitutional government around
the planet, backed by military power, most often by denigrating
other forms of government.
A striking parallel is the rise of the clerics in Europe as an alternative
to religious hegemons. From clerics came lawyerly self-regulating
hegemons. A new religion hidden within supremacist judges' black
Enough of lawful self-regulation in secrecy, unpunishable by
lawful means. Justice is out of control, prison populations stuffed,
bloated law enforcement and spies raiding the public till, private
spies, cops and mercenaries worse than the official, or
Back to the military which backs the hegemons. Technology
controls its effectiveness, thus the need for the hegemons to
control manufacture, distribution, ownership and application
of military means. Concentration of wealth through government
regulation, economic and tax policy, and military supremacy
reifies special privileges and exculpations for the enforcers
of law. Law->taxation->enforcement->informants->spying->
assassination->military action.

The Swartz situation was more complicated than the prinicipal
legal parties involved. A comprehensive legal attack implicated
a slew of people and institutions in Aaron's circle, some who were
frightened into pulling away from him, some of who were forced to
testify much to their later shame and embarassment when that was
made public.
It is not unusual for supporters to run from the scene when pressure
comes down through federal investigators digging into private
affairs, intimidating witnesses, friends and familiies with fruits of
those findings, turning poeple against each other, bamboozling
journalists and publishers who pretend opposition to authority.
Swartz's case parallels what happened to Jim Bell, and to Carl
Prosecutors are highly adept at creating fear in supporters with
grand jury subpoenas for evidence and closed testimony, then
later subpoenaed for trial. This was done with several cypherpunks,
me among them.
During two trials and his imprisonment not a few cypherpunks
came down on Jim Bell, cowardly sorry motherfuckers, some
of them once admired for courage, shown to be candyasses
out to avoid risk beyond rhetoric (as with Manning and Snowden).
Not a few came down on Aaron Swarz, cowardly sorry motherfuckers,
some of them still lamenting the loss of a brave man while hiding
their abandonment of him, stigmatizing his loss of adorableness, his
loss of lovers, true friends and supporters, his lonely withdrawal from
social affairs, his hiding inside his apartment pondering the rest of
his life betrayed by those blaming him for their chickenshitedness.
Swartz died more likely murder, enforced suicide, a killing by
officials and those unable to match Aaron's bravery.
Jim Bell and Carl Johnson were not so easily buffaloed. Although
there continues to be bountiful cowardly motherfuckers who fucked
them as was Manning, as were the Anonymous 16, and will likely be
Snowden, led by the media which takes no chances beyond
rhetoric and hypebole.

If your server or ISP generates log files, as all do, you cannot
be secure. If upstream servers generate log files, as all do,
you cannot be secure. If local, regional, national and international
servers generate log files, as all do, you cannot be secure.
So long as log files are ubiquitous on the Internet, no one can
be secure.
Log files are the fundamental weakness of the Internet
because system administrators claim the Internet cannot
be managed and maintained without them.
This is not true, it is merely an urban legend to conceal
the interests of system administrators and their customers
to exploit Internet user data.
There is no fundamental need for log files, except to
perpetuate the other urban legend, privacy policy, which
conceals the abuse of log files by web site operators
and their cooperation with "lawful" orders to reveal
user data, most often by being paid to reveal that
data to authorities, to sponsors, to funders, to
advertisers, to scholars, to private investigators,
to inside and outside lawyers, to serial cohorts,
cartels and combines, to providers and purchasers
of web sites, to educators of cyber employees,
to courts, to cybersecurity firms, to journalists, to

Logs needed run the Internet steadily, securely and cheaply
are not what logs files have grown into: Bloated, malicious,
exploitive and very lucrative spying on users. This is why there
are thousands of firms providing log files exploitation programs
and services. Every product manufacturer touts its spying
capabilities through innocent sounding "log files" ostensibly
serving administrative purpose but then just below that claim
are the burgeoning other uses of maximizing profits.
Log files are metadata of the Internet, the tip of a giant
iceberg of metadata. This is the dirty secret, the family
jewels, of the Internet, carefully rationalized and guarded
by sysadmins. Sysadmins have become the traitors, or
patriots, of the Internet. Traitors against the public, patriots
for the powerful exploiters of the Internet.
Exploitation of bloated little known, behind the public

are this but so far only pretty facades have been disclosed,
the underlying operation apparently to threatening to "national
security" to be revealed to the public. Sysadmins just adore
being foundational to this architecture of deceit

a cover for the huge industry which goes right through that
tiny aperture of access to construct an unbelievable spying
operation, far more insidious than that of the official spies,
which as we know merely copy the industry and buy a small

Thanks. We posted the Wassenaar changes on Cryptome

The intrusion software has received some but not sufficient
attention. And beyond the sections you cite there are many
covering other technologies which interrelate and affect crypto.
Those have received even less attention, at least in crypto

The means to transceive crypto continue to be its Achilles
heel and appear headed toward crippling the whole body -- the
bubble in which crypto exists precariously dependent on
sophisticated support systems which, as seen in the Snowden
minimal releases, have overwhelmed public crypto security, not
least by leaving the impression public crypto was highly effective.
More attention to the support system presumably will be given
as the Snowden releases recommence, now dead stopped.
Greenwald claimed recently  that cryptographers and other
techies are now reviewing the material, much of which is
beyond the capabilities of journalists, lawyers and politicians.
The stumbling block of comprehensive Snowden disclosures
is that to do so, allegedly, could severely damage national security.
Uh oh, that terrible aroma of complicity to protect secrets

Jake's, Assange's and others' emphasis at 30c3 was to pursue
technological offenses rather than futile expectation of political,
financial and legal controls of spying which inevitably confirm
what spies do, for it is in their interest to support spyin and
secrecy to maintain hegemonic, heirarchial institutions under
"the rule of law."
Reminder, at the origin of cypherpunks there was a crackdown
on encryption as a munitions. That skirmish was thought to
have been won. Now Snowden has revealed that victory
was a delusion, the real one-sided battle was fought
surreptiously in secret, not only by contaminating crypto
but by development of bypasses, implants, backdoors,
booby traps, ruses, scams, bribes, dual-hatted contracts
with crypto-hackers.
Can an openly avowed combat on the technologies of political
control (1) work or will it be demonized, fought by secret
underhanded means? Public debate deployed as a ruse in
the 1990s as now.
(1) An Appraisal of the Technologies of Political Control
This combat is about far more than crypto and coders must
be supplemented with all the discplines of science and
technology which are now serving industry and the
"lawful" hegemons.
30c3 advocated a direct attack on these means, not wait for
the public debate to be rigged in favor of the hegemon with
PR, propaganda, lobbying, bribery, contracts, scare stories,
terrifying incidents, the customary dirty fighting and tricks of
spies and "defense" industry.
Is that technological attack on the political, financial, legal
hegemon likely to succeed? Or will the crackdown on
armed (technological) dissent become as violent as it has
in the past?
There is a likelihood encryption will be restricted, by fiat,
by planting weaknesses, by covert attacks, by technological
bypasses, by rigged failures to create doubt of effectiveness.
That was the way CryptoAG operation was run. Now the RSA
ploy is operative. Is the effect of Snowden to be a series
of ploys and ruses. Worse, hop on board the paranoia train,
is Snowden a disinfo op for leaking gobs of ruses?
A singular feature of hegemons is that they are dominated by
"self-regulating organizations" which set the terms and conditions
of the ruling entity, assure enforcement of the rules, and perpetuate
themselves under "self-regulation."
These are successors of royalty which instead of divine right,
backed by military power, they invoke the "Constitution," a law
which distinctively empowers "lawful" behavior according to the
rules of the hegemon.
No wonder the US promotes constitutional government around
the planet, backed by military power, most often by denigrating
other forms of government.
A striking parallel is the rise of the clerics in Europe as an alternative
to religious hegemons. From clerics came lawyerly self-regulating
hegemons. A new religion hidden within supremacist judges' black
Enough of lawful self-regulation in secrecy, unpunishable by
lawful means. Justice is out of control, prison populations stuffed,
bloated law enforcement and spies raiding the public till, private
spies, cops and mercenaries worse than the official, or
Back to the military which backs the hegemons. Technology
controls its effectiveness, thus the need for the hegemons to
control manufacture, distribution, ownership and application
of military means. Concentration of wealth through government
regulation, economic and tax policy, and military supremacy
reifies special privileges and exculpations for the enforcers
of law. Law->taxation->enforcement->informants->spying->
assassination->military action.

The Swartz situation was more complicated than the prinicipal
legal parties involved. A comprehensive legal attack implicated
a slew of people and institutions in Aaron's circle, some who were
frightened into pulling away from him, some of who were forced to
testify much to their later shame and embarassment when that was
made public.
It is not unusual for supporters to run from the scene when pressure
comes down through federal investigators digging into private
affairs, intimidating witnesses, friends and familiies with fruits of
those findings, turning poeple against each other, bamboozling
journalists and publishers who pretend opposition to authority.
Swartz's case parallels what happened to Jim Bell, and to Carl
Prosecutors are highly adept at creating fear in supporters with
grand jury subpoenas for evidence and closed testimony, then
later subpoenaed for trial. This was done with several cypherpunks,
me among them.
During two trials and his imprisonment not a few cypherpunks
came down on Jim Bell, cowardly sorry motherfuckers, some
of them once admired for courage, shown to be candyasses
out to avoid risk beyond rhetoric (as with Manning and Snowden).
Not a few came down on Aaron Swarz, cowardly sorry motherfuckers,
some of them still lamenting the loss of a brave man while hiding
their abandonment of him, stigmatizing his loss of adorableness, his
loss of lovers, true friends and supporters, his lonely withdrawal from
social affairs, his hiding inside his apartment pondering the rest of
his life betrayed by those blaming him for their chickenshitedness.
Swartz died more likely murder, enforced suicide, a killing by
officials and those unable to match Aaron's bravery.
Jim Bell and Carl Johnson were not so easily buffaloed. Although
there continues to be bountiful cowardly motherfuckers who fucked
them as was Manning, as were the Anonymous 16, and will likely be

If your server or ISP generates log files, as all do, you cannot
be secure. If upstream servers generate log files, as all do,
you cannot be secure. If local, regional, national and international
servers generate log files, as all do, you cannot be secure.
So long as log files are ubiquitous on the Internet, no one can
be secure.
Log files are the fundamental weakness of the Internet
because system administrators claim the Internet cannot
be managed and maintained without them.
This is not true, it is merely an urban legend to conceal
the interests of system administrators and their customers
to exploit Internet user data.
There is no fundamental need for log files, except to
perpetuate the other urban legend, privacy policy, which
conceals the abuse of log files by web site operators
and their cooperation with "lawful" orders to reveal
user data, most often by being paid to reveal that
data to authorities, to sponsors, to funders, to
advertisers, to scholars, to private investigators,
to inside and outside lawyers, to serial cohorts,
cartels and combines, to providers and purchasers
of web sites, to educators of cyber employees,
to courts, to cybersecurity firms, to journalists, to

Logs needed run the Internet steadily, securely and cheaply

are thousands of firms providing log files exploitation programs
and services. Every product manufacturer touts its spying
capabilities through innocent sounding "log files" ostensibly
serving administrative purpose but then just below that claim
are the burgeoning other uses of maximizing profits.
Log files are metadata of the Internet, the tip of a giant
iceberg of metadata. This is the dirty secret, the family
jewels, of the Internet, carefully rationalized and guarded
by sysadmins. Sysadmins have become the traitors, or
patriots, of the Internet. Traitors against the public, patriots

a cover for the huge industry which goes right through that
tiny aperture of access to construct an unbelievable spying
operation, far more insidious than that of the official spies,

Thanks. We posted the Wassenaar changes on Cryptome

The intrusion software has received some but not sufficient
attention. And beyond the sections you cite there are many
covering other technologies which interrelate and affect crypto.
Those have received even less attention, at least in crypto
world as far as we have seen.
The means to transceive crypto continue to be its Achilles
heel and appear headed toward crippling the whole body -- the
bubble in which crypto exists precariously dependent on
sophisticated support systems which, as seen in the Snowden
minimal releases, have overwhelmed public crypto security, not
least by leaving the impression public crypto was highly effective.
More attention to the support system presumably will be given
as the Snowden releases recommence, now dead stopped.
Greenwald claimed recently  that cryptographers and other
techies are now reviewing the material, much of which is
beyond the capabilities of journalists, lawyers and politicians.
The stumbling block of comprehensive Snowden disclosures
is that to do so, allegedly, could severely damage national security.
Uh oh, that terrible aroma of complicity to protect secrets

Recently it was learned that code, crypto code at least, had become
superfluous. Nothing like that protects anything, and never did. It
has joined alchemy, phrenology, snake religion and astrology as
a pseudo-science for TED rituals and RSA suspicion-fest,
still beloved by the faithful, practiced by charlatans, funded
unstoppably by DoD research and to fill a vast repository of
"unbroken messages" out in Utah, a scholarly debunking topic of
historical recollections of aged cryptographers and classified
conferences at NSA and GCHQ to keep up appearances
of once unbeatable prowess. Fort Meade being converted
to a hospice for the greatest collection of mathematicians.
Decrypting computers are silently humming with nothing to
crack, blowing through Megawatts of power to protect the jobs
of hundreds of sysadmins and, yes, dumbfoundedly useless
coders surfing for android bestiality.
Quantum computing collapsed with a whisper, never fulfilling
its promise to render cryptography useless, beaten by a guy
named Snowden or something who revealed that the crypto
leader of the universe had arranged the end of trustworthy
crypto code by rigging holes and backdoors and tricks and
planting malware in every conceivable piece of machinery
everywhere all the time.

enforce it stringently, above and below the table. Nor will a journalist
working for a commercial outlet. The perks of privilege for both
industries are just too beneficial. (WikiLeaks was taken over by
lawyers and journalists precursing Snowden's takeover.)
Oh, and they shop clients and sources through confabs in chambers
and consultation with officials, and, really nasty, by access to
classified and secret information. Does that sound like dual-use
comsec, yes, that is what it is.
Far too many lawyers are in government. Push some techs. Go

Clamoring to get on NSA hit lists for popular support and corresponding
business, researching, teaching, litigating and speaking opportunities is
a frenzy. Once it was a booster being on the FBI hit lists, then CIA,
then KGB, then MI5 and/or MI6, then Mossad, then Savak, then Cheney,
then Bin Laden, then AQ in Yemen, now Glenn Greenwald is swamped
with applicants to be put on list of names of US persons who are
desperate to be surveilled for starring roles in the multiple scripts of
the Snowden blockbusters, with many more digital Che's in the pipeline.
Snowden's mom has not yet, in public, rolled out a campaign for
evelasting fame and profit for her darling like Assange's mother
and various fathers.
Ed's dad has had his team going full blast for a year, in concert with
ACLU, EFF, Plato Cacheris and a gaggle of natsec sharks
and stunt arrangers, the red phones are hot between DC and
Moscow to set up beamings of Snowden for queues of ass-kissers
eager to be photographed with his metadata-rich talking head.
US attorneys in Eastern Virginia, DC, Southern NY and Northern CA
are wagering on who gets Assange, who gets Snowden, who
gets Greenwald, who gets Poitras, Appelbaum and unnamed
co-conspirators along with the dudes at EFF for orchestrating
Ed's seduction, purloining and dashings from Japan to Maryland
to Hawaii to Hong Kong to Moscow.
Other ex-NSA patriots are in heavy demand to beef up the
lightweight Snowden with dark musings on what the young
man had no access to but they did and will never ever tell.
Behind the legal and media shindigs technical agents are working
the outliers, FOI minions, CCC, Pirates, Torrents, Drops, Jabbers,
chats, IP2s, the invisible -- really -- of dark nets to gather intel on
counterspying apparatus and IO errors.
This is Phase 1.

draconian secrecy agreements which imperil disclosers with

workers happily having DoD do what's necessary to bring in 100%

Reason: citizen tax squeeze is rising as wealthy and corporations shed
tax burden by NGOs, off-shore evasion, moving HQs overseas, hiring,
manufacturing and financing overseas, massaging taxation laws, bribing
revenuers and office holders, increasing crackdown on citizen tax
deductions, hiring more private police to intimidate those asking for
better pay, offloading environmental crimes to taxpayers, buying
legislators to enact favors for high-profit, high-income beneficiaries,
controlling and ffixing elections to pack offices with sleazes who
work for them before, during and after holding office.

Cyber Security Market Forecast 2014-2024: Prospects For Leading Companies in Military, Government, Critical Infrastructure & Private Sector Protection
Defence report
Cyber attacks continue to dominate the headlines, and with good reason. While the threat of cyber security is often exaggerated, there is no doubt that the enhanced networking of society has created substantial vulnerabilities lurking within its interconnected pathways. With attackers able to strike from anywhere and inflict damage on a significant (but often unnoticed) scale, the threat has never been greater to the reams of knowledge held by governments and enterprise. There is also the threat to military information sharing networks representing a significant challenge: in an era of increased integration between systems and platforms, the very webs which act as force multipliers could collapse. Efforts to counter these extensive vulnerabilities are presently ongoing to an impressive degree, and the speed of these developments is not expected to lessen unduly. As a consequence, visiongain has assessed that the value of the global Cyber Security market in 2014 will reach $76.68bn.

If NSA and GCHQ were, are, doing these alleged operations as surmised
with slightest evidence greatly amplified, cherry-picked and moshed like
a Tom Clancy hot seller, it is likely the Devil's Duo are meticulously
tracking, siphoning and implanting:
1. Those reporting, editing, checking, formatting and posting these
stories and documents from various countries and those spying all
these from inside and outside.
2. The hosting and keyservers of The Intercept, First Look and
interconnections and those spying all these from inside and outside.
3. The transceivals among the media staff, lawyers, bankers, bedmates
and those spying all these from inside and outside.
4. The comsec wizards being consulted and those they are leaking
stuff to and those spying all these from inside and outside.
5. The officials being asked for comment and their roladexes of
insiders and those spying all these from inside and outside.
6. The multiple-agencies counter-counter-intel agents double-checking
everyone involved and those spying all these from inside and outside.
7. The thousands necessarily swept up in the spiderwebs of linkages
for immediate or distant actionable operations and those spying all
these from inside and outside.
8. The other national spies working the same territories of gullible
targets armored with the world's greatest comsec protection,
no matter what ex-spies and ex-contractors claim is absolutely
dependable means to assure nobody is swiping and siphoning
and those spying all these from inside and outside.
Months, years to come, there will be even more gushings about
what has been dribbled out with insufficient context to understand
what is media hyperbole and what is worth worrying about and those
spying all these from inside and outside standards orgs, FOI
racketeering, crypto entrepreneurs of com, edu, org and
open source treacheries.
Recap: About 1,333 Snowden documents have been released by
commercial media, none for free.
Greenwald has said he gets about $1,500 per story in which he
gets a byline. Excluding the $1M signing bonus he has allegedly
got from Omidyar, he has made at least another million.
Gellman, Poitras perhaps the same (Poitras may have gotten a
similar signing bonus).
Other dozens of reporters were paid a percentage of that.
So it might be estimated the gang of reporters have garnered
some $4-5M so far.
Media outlets have probably earned 10 times that in sales and ads.
The USG, allies and enemies have probably received similar
amounts to respond to Snowden, some $50-100M.
So call it a $200-500M affair to date.
If the USG and other govs work the bonanza as predicted,
over 10-20 years the operation will generate, conservatively,
a $1-5T boost for comsec religionists and exploiters of media,
spies, universities, telcos, web operators, program peddlers,
AV magicians, games designers, not counting SM and SEOs
and spammers and botnets.
Black markets could match that amount, or multiples of it.
Meanwhile the comsec industry -- gov, mil, com, edu, org -- will
continue reaping the rewards of faith-based sin and salvation.
Thanks, Ed.

Snowden may have raised the prospect of comsec as a public utility
like power, water, gas, sewage, air quality, environmental protection
and telecommunications. Privacy protection has been shown to be
illusory at best, deceptive at worst, due to the uncontrollable
technology applied erroneously for national security.
Each of the other public utilities began as private offerings before
becoming commercialized and then institutionalized as necessities,
many eventually near or wholly monopolies.
Each also evolved into military targets for control, contamination,
destruction, and in some cases excluded as too essential for
civilian livelihood to target.
Comsec as a right for human discourse rather than a commercial

NSA's ubiquitous spying on everybody at home and elsewhere
with technology beyond accountability does raise the chances of
getting agreement of all targets -- gov, com, edu, org -- to say
enough is enough, national security has become a catchall for
inexcusable invasion of the public realm.

Your sig: "earth::water::air::fire::mind::spirit::soul" (EWAFMSS)
pretty well covers the area of operations needing ubiquitous comsec
against ubuiquitous spying of EWAFMSS.
Certainly there will be violations and spying by those who design,
run and abuse the systems of EWAFMSS.
Especially those who are excused from accountability to "maintain
the systems, or debug" EWAFMSS.
More narrowly, system operators, network operators, maintenance
staff, repariers, holders of keys to and lockpicks of the systems, ie, the
Snowdens, the spies, the governors, will usurp control and unilaterally
or collectively decide they know what is best for the systems' users,
and that inevitably coincides with self-interest of the system operators
of EWAFMSS.
Given that inevitability of self-interest, cloaked in high-minded rationales
of public service, or national security, what inevitably must be done to
reign in the inevitable abusers of privilege, public service, national
security, ie EWAFMSS.
A range of options: assassination, revolution, counterspying, treason,
war, founding of new faiths, schemes and con jobs in EWAFMSS.
For comsec that could entail implantation of electroshock devices
in every system operator which punishes, or in extremity, kills, for
misbehavior programmed into the widgets. Hack a key, pick a lock,
mosh RNG, open a backdoor, break a vow of public service, get
singed as a warning, keep it up, get fried.
This is basicly what NSA is implanting around the globe in systems
if not witting and unwitting operators. Starting with implantation of
their own Snowdens of devices of disinformation which leads the
poor goofs to think they know the system vulns. Then the goofs
spread the disinfo to, say, the Greenwalds, Poitras's and Gellmans
who then goofily spread it to the public goofiness consumers.
Blessing this operation is the FISC judges who mightily try to
understand WTF DoJ is blowing at them to cloud what NSA is
actually doing with its systems of EWAFMSS.
Read the FISC orders to see the solons gyrate and spasm
a pretense of understanding what is intended ot be non-understandable.
NSA proceeds totally unhindered to do what it wants with abusing
EWAFMSS, condoned by FISC glossing of the abuse -- what is
done in the US is done worldwide for managing and exploiting for
self-interest EWAFMSS.
Yes, these very lists foster the appeal of exploiting the expoitation
of EWAFMSS by pretending to oppose it, to found a new scheme
of assassination, revolution, etc, etc. This will inevitably lead to
compromisable proponents to be bribed and recruited for service
in the established exploiters: billionaires, journalists, lawyers, courts,
tech corporations, telcos, LEs, TLAs, Vaticans, Israelis, Muslims,
Tea Parties, nations, black marketers, financial crime syndicates,
freedom of information hustlers, leakers, and, most beautifully
remunerative, crypto-comsec mofos.
There's the pitch for comsec public utility, crypto-comsec mofos
signing up to be implanted with EM devices for a Tor-Greenwald-grade
lifetime of comfort bribe to loyally and patriotically run the sysems of
EWAFMSS. Then immediately break the vow, hack the devices,
cheat, lie, steal, bolthole an embassy, refuge in a rogue state,
for a while enjoy the warm feeling of triumph, then be Zapped
remotely for belief in knowing more than the Devil in the Details.

Snowden's video, comments and talks at SXSW convey the failure

comfortable fold of Snowden's "do no harm to national security."
This blind faith in natsec cautionary implantation in Snowden and
his media outlets aided by technical advisors and officials, assures
redaction-rich risklessness in accord with the NSA-DoJ-bamboozled

@_subject: Comsec as Public Utility Beyond Illusory Privacy 
A point not well emphasized by cryptographers, in public at least,
and advocates of encryption as the essential requirement for
"Unbeakable crypto" may not be used as much as it once was
but there are a host of newly-minted versions of snake oilish
assurances dominating the booming comsec market, thanks
to Snowden's magnificent gift, estimated to eventually reach
the trillion dollar level in two decades, to the gov-com-edu-org
comsec panic industry.
Operators of systems, and the necessarily breachable security they
offer, remain the achilles heels of comsec. Lavabit is only one of
the instances in which sysadmins are compromised. Ubiquitous
deployment of crypto throughout telecom and cyber systems is
vulnerable to sysadmins who insist on full access to everything
to "de-bug" and run their systems, especially those SAs easily
manipulated by front offices and their ever so cooperative legal and
financial advisors. Not many SAs wil do what Snowden did in the
"public interest" which just happens to be a great fortune maker
for media and comsec hustlers.
End to end encryption is currently a hot recommendation of choice
for comsec but skips over what happens behind, below, around and
inside "end to end" code, hardware, implementation, and most of
all the traffic flow of the precious capsules emitting transceiver
vapor trails, EM clutter, arfully cloaked gaps, doors, handshakes,
implants, bugs (and "de-bugs"), ways in and out, checks, double
checks, safety plugs, sigs, nyms, language hints, and manifold
uniquenesses witting and unwitting of fallible hunks of meat.
It is, or should be, primary for cryptographers to publicly admit
cryptosystems inevitably fail, as some do despite being overridden
by sales and CEOs and investors, being bribed and NDA'd into
complicity, or in worst cases threatened with prosecution for
revealing in natsec systems built-in faults or more deviously,
pretending there are none while glossing deep deception with
shallow claims that there are always a few which can be repaired,
nothing is perfect, you get what you pay for, etc, etc, the
formulaic exculpation inherent in the word "security."
No question this is expecting cryptographers to be more honest
than the rest of the greedy "professional" class so avid to profess
public interest while gobbling the public's hard earned with gleeful
transgression slathered in "industry standards" and global treaties
to assure governments and corporations remain piggish and
dispensaries of rewards for the professional classes which
find oligarchal enticements "irresistable" as Greenwald slobbered
in agreeing to work closely with gov-com to withhold secrets
under guise of ventriloquizing Snowden's "causing no harm to
national security."
"Causing no harm to national security" is verily medieval in its
creed-promotional organized religion fervor. Cryptographers
have long been missionaries for this duplicitous "trust us" faith,
so it figures they will evangelize among journalists to adopt
encryption to upgrade the low value of the fear and trembling
scripture, and, as always, the compensation for scribes of
arcane holy writ of bare panic and crypto balm.

wait ... are you saying money corrupts ???
if you are saying that corruption is at hand then how can we trust the supposed human beings behind any of these names ? i mean i think you are saying corruption is at hand but i dont want to assume anything...
Assume this promotional creed screed for national security journalism:
No, media venality is not news. What is worth examining is the long-term
exploitation of "national security" as a joint gov-com-edu-org
racket to manipulate secretkeeping as a wealth concentration
industry. This has been commonplace since the national security
state was invented after WW2 and led to need for continuous
spying to manufacture enemies and to arm for diddly squat combat
against fictious foes by hugely expensive but hardly ever used
armaments. Cryptosystems among the black budgetary wastage.
In particular cryptosystem popularization (as here and its emulators)
as ostensible opposition to the national security racket, begun in the
flower-child 60s to flower wildly in the 90s and rise to a kudzu crescendo
with Snowden's operation to validate crypto use against illusory
enemies within the state, cloaked as usual by the blanket exculpt
"to do no harm to national security," then hide behind privileged
natsec journalism so dirty and complicit in govenment affairs it
needs protection from the public, so merely dribbles dainty
tidbits of threats to privacy and to advance the favorite ACLU
and EFF lawyerly fund-raising hobgobblin of constitutional
FISA Court jiggery-pokery by lawfare warriors indicates that
lawyers and judges know diddly about comsec technology
but dare not admit it and lose control of the public narrative
of threat and protection obligatory in the trillion dollar national
security hootenany which compares to organized religion of the
medieval era which ruled heaven and earth with fantasticly
frightening and pleasuring tales of evil and salvation.
Adled journalists are racing to adopt encryption as crusading
chain mail raiment, ignorant of how easily it can be penetrated,
but no matter, what will really protect the valiant journalists is
"constitutional protection," a comedy of conceit and stupidity
usually associated with court jesters.

@_subject: Skype and Crypto Pushed by Snowden a Ploy? 
In connection with using "encrypted, secure connection" Skype for
Snowden's imagery at SXSW and TED, as well as encrypted comms
with journalists and event organizers, what has led these comsec
advisors to believe that all too vulnerable Skype is secure, as well
as all too vulnerable popular crypto pushed for journalists?
Is there any indication Snowden has deployed less vulnerable
protections which have not been disclosed as backing for his
encouragement to trust encryption and to allow Skype to
finger his location and leak his comms?
To be sure, many of his remarks seem to be carefully scripted
for low-brow consumption characteristic of journalism. So there
may be a secure back-channel being used with Skype and pop
crypto as diversion.
The low-brow slides, clips, short docs, redactions released by the
media point to a deception of some sort yet to be disclosed until
25 years has passed. Hyperventilating press accounts of the
releases suggest either deception, inexperience or technical
ignorance or all.
Still, that kind of misleading comsec deception would be commonplace
security measures characterisitic of NSA and wizards -- to induce the
flock to churn massive amount publicity about encrypted comms --
and Skype -- to camouflage the Tor, blacker and deeper comms,
not to say the even blacker and deeper tools not seen by Snowden
or not yet released.
More sopisticated would be to use the small amount of NSA releases
to cloak far greater distribution (a method used by WikiLeaks and
the black market as well as the spy industry). That too would closer
to what the big boys and girls do, and therefore would be exactly what
they are watching for. Including watching for ploys to hide ploys.

Sys admins catch you hunting them and arrange compromises
to fit your demands so you can crow about how skilled you are.
Then you hire them after being duped as you duped to be hired.
The lead Tor designer reportedly (via Washington Post) had a
session with NSA to brief on how to compromise it, although
"compromise" was not used nor is the word used by
Not many honest comsec wizards nowadays are promising
more than compromised comsec, and the compromise is gradually
increasing as Snowden material is dribbled out to convince the
public and wizards not a hell of a lot can be done about it except
believe in and buy more compromised comsec.
Not news here and in comsec wizard-land, to be sure, but
compromised comsec is the industry standard, as the industry
and its wizards in and out of government enjoy the boom and
bust in comsec tools generated by precursors of Snowden,
Snowden and his successors.
Compromisability is assumed by the comsec industry to be a
fundamental feature in all nations, no need to advertise it, much
better to advertise how great comsec is and now much it is
needed. Crypto-wizards have a long history of compromising
believers who hire them and who suffer their promises of
highly trusted protection.
Trusted comsec is necessary to get persons to pack their
comms with compromisable information. The greater the
trust the greater the revelations of just what is desired.
So what if laws are aleays jiggered to allow access to the
revelations "under legal pressure" and "FISC orders."
That has been a fundamental feature of crypto and
comsec wizardry.

@_subject: To Tor or not to Tor? 
Ubiquitous use of a comsec system is a vulnerability, whether
PGP or Tor or another popular means. Crypto advocates and
Tor encourage widespread use as a defense but may be luring
victims into traps. The more users of a system the more likely
it will be attacked by officials or by malefactors. And the attacks
are most often overlooked in the volume, or excused as a price
of popularity, fixes underway, always underway, keeping coders
and investors happy as engineers mud-wrestling and financiers
Most trusted systems (MTS) are where the money is, as with banks,
so that's where robbers make their living, and MTS set up budgets
for loss, PR, lobbying, training staff in cover-ups and workarounds,
hiring ex-regulators and distinguished industry leaders as advisors,
board members and faces of the MTS around the planet.
The lucrative boomlet in comsec generated by Snowden Inc's
marketing gambit promoting encryption and enhanced comsec
among media mouthpiece megaphones indicates that another
cycle of dubity of the status quo comsec confidence game is
to be followed by a repair and rejigger protection racket,
as evidenced on these mail lists, at conferences, and no doubt
in halls of semi-classified exchanges everready to share tips
and tricks to ratchet up demand for security in all its devilish
Was it not mere months ago when a call was issued to redesign
and or replace the entire Internet from top to bottom, the whole
thing, to end the futile comsec tinkering and delusionary marketing,
no way the Frankenstein could be made secure for human use,
it had fundamental faults which precluded durable comsec.
Perhaps re-Frankensteining is being done in semi-classified
halls, hindered by by official and commercial and scholarly
exploiters of the monster's faults to advance their interests
in advocating MTS for public use, just keep those research
and investment funds flowing.
No risk, no security market, so what fool would want an Internet that
had no faults. No bank would want perfect security to be available
directly to customers. No military or spy agency would want perfect
national security available to the citizenry. No government would
want a threat-free populace. No comsec industry would want ...
Best to aim for pretty good comsec and call it best that can
be done but cheating happens, thank you Edward Snowden,
so prepare for disaster "not if, not when, but now." Intel
committees wokring hand in hand with Snowden Inc. to keep
the public panicky and needful of secrecy protection of
the holy grail, national security backed by WMD.
In short, Tor is a confidence game, crypto is a confidence game,
no better than military, espionage, publicity, entertainment, finance,
law, insurance, education and religion. Oops those are the primary
routes to wealth and power concentration and need for WMD
What, you say WMD is a confidence game? Getoutahere, that's
top secret codeword core faith in secretkeeping. Without that
fundamental Frankensteinian fault nobody would buy security
against the Doctors of monsters working hard at most secret
laboratories on earth to devise crypto for assuring WMD comms
and launch threats are pretty good at persuading the public to
pay the steep protection fee -- which it should be noted is
laundered through IRS and NGOs, blessed by FRS and SEC.

"Also keep in mind that there are no confirmed on the record cases to

One of the perdurable claims of comsec promoters is that comsec

who the fictitious user is remains obscure but assuredly means
somebody other than the comsec promoter user who inevitably
offers a greatly improved product, trust them.
Tor is especially adept at blaming users, itself faultless except for lack
of volunteers to patch its innumerable holes (caused by clueless users),
so much so one might think that is a feature derived from the religion
of national security (actually that is its source and shows its heritage
of exculpability) which inevitably fails due to lack of funding, political
  will, public support, unwillingness of youngsters to die for officer

Has there been a better account of inevitable exculpability for
inevitable comsec failure than that by NSA in 1998?

Defence report
Cyber attacks continue to dominate the headlines, and with good reason. While the threat of cyber security is often exaggerated, there is no doubt that the enhanced networking of society has created substantial vulnerabilities lurking within its interconnected pathways. With attackers able to strike from anywhere and inflict damage on a significant (but often unnoticed) scale, the threat has never been greater to the reams of knowledge held by governments and enterprise. There is also the threat to military information sharing networks representing a significant challenge: in an era of increased integration between systems and platforms, the very webs which act as force multipliers could collapse. Efforts to counter these extensive vulnerabilities are presently ongoing to an impressive degree, and the speed of these developments is not expected to lessen unduly. As a consequence, visiongain has assessed that the value of the global Cyber Security market in 2014 will reach $76.68bn.

1. Those reporting, editing, checking, formatting and posting these

what is media hyperbole and what is worth worrying about and those
spying all these from inside and outside standards orgs, FOI
racketeering, crypto entrepreneurs of com, edu, org and
open source treacheries.
Recap: About 1,333 Snowden documents have been released by
commercial media, none for free.
Greenwald has said he gets about $1,500 per story in which he
gets a byline. Excluding the $1M signing bonus he has allegedly
got from Omidyar, he has made at least another million.
Gellman, Poitras perhaps the same (Poitras may have gotten a
similar signing bonus).
Other dozens of reporters were paid a percentage of that.
So it might be estimated the gang of reporters have garnered
some $4-5M so far.
Media outlets have probably earned 10 times that in sales and ads.
The USG, allies and enemies have probably received similar
amounts to respond to Snowden, some $50-100M.
So call it a $200-500M affair to date.
If the USG and other govs work the bonanza as predicted,
over 10-20 years the operation will generate, conservatively,
a $1-5T boost for comsec religionists and exploiters of media,
spies, universities, telcos, web operators, program peddlers,
AV magicians, games designers, not counting SM and SEOs
and spammers and botnets.
Black markets could match that amount, or multiples of it.
Meanwhile the comsec industry -- gov, mil, com, edu, org -- will
continue reaping the rewards of faith-based sin and salvation.

Snowden may have raised the prospect of comsec as a public utility
like power, water, gas, sewage, air quality, environmental protection
and telecommunications. Privacy protection has been shown to be
illusory at best, deceptive at worst, due to the uncontrollable
technology applied erroneously for national security.
Each of the other public utilities began as private offerings before
becoming commercialized and then institutionalized as necessities,
many eventually near or wholly monopolies.
Each also evolved into military targets for control, contamination,
destruction, and in some cases excluded as too essential for
civilian livelihood to target.
Comsec as a right for human discourse rather than a commercial
service could enforce privacy beyond easy violation for official
and commercial purposes.
Freedom of comsec, say, as a new entry in the US Bill of Rights
could lead the way for it to be a fundamental element of Human

with technology beyond accountability does raise the chances of

Your sig: "earth::water::air::fire::mind::spirit::soul" (EWAFMSS)
pretty well covers the area of operations needing ubiquitous comsec
against ubuiquitous spying of EWAFMSS.
Certainly there will be violations and spying by those who design,
run and abuse the systems of EWAFMSS.
Especially those who are excused from accountability to "maintain
the systems, or debug" EWAFMSS.
More narrowly, system operators, network operators, maintenance
staff, repariers, holders of keys to and lockpicks of the systems, ie, the
Snowdens, the spies, the governors, will usurp control and unilaterally
or collectively decide they know what is best for the systems' users,
and that inevitably coincides with self-interest of the system operators
of EWAFMSS.
Given that inevitability of self-interest, cloaked in high-minded rationales
of public service, or national security, what inevitably must be done to
reign in the inevitable abusers of privilege, public service, national
security, ie EWAFMSS.
A range of options: assassination, revolution, counterspying, treason,
war, founding of new faiths, schemes and con jobs in EWAFMSS.
For comsec that could entail implantation of electroshock devices
in every system operator which punishes, or in extremity, kills, for
misbehavior programmed into the widgets. Hack a key, pick a lock,
mosh RNG, open a backdoor, break a vow of public service, get
singed as a warning, keep it up, get fried.
This is basicly what NSA is implanting around the globe in systems

their own Snowdens of devices of disinformation which leads the
poor goofs to think they know the system vulns. Then the goofs
spread the disinfo to, say, the Greenwalds, Poitras's and Gellmans
who then goofily spread it to the public goofiness consumers.

Yes, these very lists foster the appeal of exploiting the expoitation
of EWAFMSS by pretending to oppose it, to found a new scheme
of assassination, revolution, etc, etc. This will inevitably lead to
compromisable proponents to be bribed and recruited for service

tech corporations, telcos, LEs, TLAs, Vaticans, Israelis, Muslims,
Tea Parties, nations, black marketers, financial crime syndicates,
freedom of information hustlers, leakers, and, most beautifully
remunerative, crypto-comsec mofos.
There's the pitch for comsec public utility, crypto-comsec mofos
signing up to be implanted with EM devices for a Tor-Greenwald-grade
lifetime of comfort bribe to loyally and patriotically run the sysems of
EWAFMSS. Then immediately break the vow, hack the devices,

@_subject: Comsec as Public Utility Beyond Illusory Privacy 
A point not well emphasized by cryptographers, in public at least,
and advocates of encryption as the essential requirement for
"Unbeakable crypto" may not be used as much as it once was
but there are a host of newly-minted versions of snake oilish
assurances dominating the booming comsec market, thanks
to Snowden's magnificent gift, estimated to eventually reach
the trillion dollar level in two decades, to the gov-com-edu-org
comsec panic industry.
Operators of systems, and the necessarily breachable security they
offer, remain the achilles heels of comsec. Lavabit is only one of
the instances in which sysadmins are compromised. Ubiquitous
deployment of crypto throughout telecom and cyber systems is
vulnerable to sysadmins who insist on full access to everything
to "de-bug" and run their systems, especially those SAs easily
manipulated by front offices and their ever so cooperative legal and
financial advisors. Not many SAs wil do what Snowden did in the
"public interest" which just happens to be a great fortune maker
for media and comsec hustlers.
End to end encryption is currently a hot recommendation of choice
for comsec but skips over what happens behind, below, around and
inside "end to end" code, hardware, implementation, and most of
all the traffic flow of the precious capsules emitting transceiver
vapor trails, EM clutter, arfully cloaked gaps, doors, handshakes,
implants, bugs (and "de-bugs"), ways in and out, checks, double
checks, safety plugs, sigs, nyms, language hints, and manifold
uniquenesses witting and unwitting of fallible hunks of meat.
It is, or should be, primary for cryptographers to publicly admit
cryptosystems inevitably fail, as some do despite being overridden
by sales and CEOs and investors, being bribed and NDA'd into
complicity, or in worst cases threatened with prosecution for
revealing in natsec systems built-in faults or more deviously,
pretending there are none while glossing deep deception with
shallow claims that there are always a few which can be repaired,
nothing is perfect, you get what you pay for, etc, etc, the
formulaic exculpation inherent in the word "security."
No question this is expecting cryptographers to be more honest
than the rest of the greedy "professional" class so avid to profess
public interest while gobbling the public's hard earned with gleeful
transgression slathered in "industry standards" and global treaties
to assure governments and corporations remain piggish and
dispensaries of rewards for the professional classes which
find oligarchal enticements "irresistable" as Greenwald slobbered
in agreeing to work closely with gov-com to withhold secrets
under guise of ventriloquizing Snowden's "causing no harm to
national security."
"Causing no harm to national security" is verily medieval in its
creed-promotional organized religion fervor. Cryptographers
have long been missionaries for this duplicitous "trust us" faith,
so it figures they will evangelize among journalists to adopt
encryption to upgrade the low value of the fear and trembling
scripture, and, as always, the compensation for scribes of
arcane holy writ of bare panic and crypto balm.

"cryptography  mail.com>
wait ... are you saying money corrupts ???
if you are saying that corruption is at hand then how can we trust the supposed human beings behind any of these names ? i mean i think you are saying corruption is at hand but i dont want to assume anything...
Assume this promotional creed screed for national security journalism:
No, media venality is not news. What is worth examining is the long-term
exploitation of "national security" as a joint gov-com-edu-org
racket to manipulate secretkeeping as a wealth concentration
industry. This has been commonplace since the national security
state was invented after WW2 and led to need for continuous
spying to manufacture enemies and to arm for diddly squat combat
against fictious foes by hugely expensive but hardly ever used
armaments. Cryptosystems among the black budgetary wastage.
In particular cryptosystem popularization (as here and its emulators)
as ostensible opposition to the national security racket, begun in the
flower-child 60s to flower wildly in the 90s and rise to a kudzu crescendo
with Snowden's operation to validate crypto use against illusory
enemies within the state, cloaked as usual by the blanket exculpt
"to do no harm to national security," then hide behind privileged
natsec journalism so dirty and complicit in govenment affairs it
needs protection from the public, so merely dribbles dainty
tidbits of threats to privacy and to advance the favorite ACLU
and EFF lawyerly fund-raising hobgobblin of constitutional
FISA Court jiggery-pokery by lawfare warriors indicates that
lawyers and judges know diddly about comsec technology
but dare not admit it and lose control of the public narrative
of threat and protection obligatory in the trillion dollar national
security hootenany which compares to organized religion of the
medieval era which ruled heaven and earth with fantasticly
frightening and pleasuring tales of evil and salvation.
Adled journalists are racing to adopt encryption as crusading
chain mail raiment, ignorant of how easily it can be penetrated,
but no matter, what will really protect the valiant journalists is
"constitutional protection," a comedy of conceit and stupidity
usually associated with court jesters.

@_subject: Skype and Crypto Pushed by Snowden a Ploy? 
In connection with using "encrypted, secure connection" Skype for
Snowden's imagery at SXSW and TED, as well as encrypted comms
with journalists and event organizers, what has led these comsec
advisors to believe that all too vulnerable Skype is secure, as well
as all too vulnerable popular crypto pushed for journalists?
Is there any indication Snowden has deployed less vulnerable
protections which have not been disclosed as backing for his
encouragement to trust encryption and to allow Skype to
finger his location and leak his comms?
To be sure, many of his remarks seem to be carefully scripted
for low-brow consumption characteristic of journalism. So there
may be a secure back-channel being used with Skype and pop
crypto as diversion.
The low-brow slides, clips, short docs, redactions released by the
media point to a deception of some sort yet to be disclosed until
25 years has passed. Hyperventilating press accounts of the
releases suggest either deception, inexperience or technical
ignorance or all.
Still, that kind of misleading comsec deception would be commonplace
security measures characterisitic of NSA and wizards -- to induce the
flock to churn massive amount publicity about encrypted comms --
and Skype -- to camouflage the Tor, blacker and deeper comms,
not to say the even blacker and deeper tools not seen by Snowden
or not yet released.
More sopisticated would be to use the small amount of NSA releases
to cloak far greater distribution (a method used by WikiLeaks and
the black market as well as the spy industry). That too would closer
to what the big boys and girls do, and therefore would be exactly what
they are watching for. Including watching for ploys to hide ploys.

Sys admins catch you hunting them and arrange compromises
to fit your demands so you can crow about how skilled you are.
Then you hire them after being duped as you duped to be hired.
The lead Tor designer reportedly (via Washington Post) had a
session with NSA to brief on how to compromise it, although
"compromise" was not used nor is the word used by
Not many honest comsec wizards nowadays are promising
more than compromised comsec, and the compromise is gradually
increasing as Snowden material is dribbled out to convince the
public and wizards not a hell of a lot can be done about it except
believe in and buy more compromised comsec.
Not news here and in comsec wizard-land, to be sure, but
compromised comsec is the industry standard, as the industry
and its wizards in and out of government enjoy the boom and
bust in comsec tools generated by precursors of Snowden,
Snowden and his successors.
Compromisability is assumed by the comsec industry to be a
fundamental feature in all nations, no need to advertise it, much
better to advertise how great comsec is and now much it is
needed. Crypto-wizards have a long history of compromising
believers who hire them and who suffer their promises of
highly trusted protection.
Trusted comsec is necessary to get persons to pack their
comms with compromisable information. The greater the
trust the greater the revelations of just what is desired.
So what if laws are aleays jiggered to allow access to the
revelations "under legal pressure" and "FISC orders."
That has been a fundamental feature of crypto and
comsec wizardry.

@_subject: To Tor or not to Tor? 
Ubiquitous use of a comsec system is a vulnerability, whether
PGP or Tor or another popular means. Crypto advocates and
Tor encourage widespread use as a defense but may be luring
victims into traps. The more users of a system the more likely
it will be attacked by officials or by malefactors. And the attacks
are most often overlooked in the volume, or excused as a price
of popularity, fixes underway, always underway, keeping coders
and investors happy as engineers mud-wrestling and financiers
Most trusted systems (MTS) are where the money is, as with banks,
so that's where robbers make their living, and MTS set up budgets
for loss, PR, lobbying, training staff in cover-ups and workarounds,
hiring ex-regulators and distinguished industry leaders as advisors,
board members and faces of the MTS around the planet.
The lucrative boomlet in comsec generated by Snowden Inc's
marketing gambit promoting encryption and enhanced comsec
among media mouthpiece megaphones indicates that another
cycle of dubity of the status quo comsec confidence game is
to be followed by a repair and rejigger protection racket,
as evidenced on these mail lists, at conferences, and no doubt
in halls of semi-classified exchanges everready to share tips
and tricks to ratchet up demand for security in all its devilish
Was it not mere months ago when a call was issued to redesign
and or replace the entire Internet from top to bottom, the whole
thing, to end the futile comsec tinkering and delusionary marketing,
no way the Frankenstein could be made secure for human use,
it had fundamental faults which precluded durable comsec.
Perhaps re-Frankensteining is being done in semi-classified
halls, hindered by by official and commercial and scholarly
exploiters of the monster's faults to advance their interests
in advocating MTS for public use, just keep those research
and investment funds flowing.
No risk, no security market, so what fool would want an Internet that
had no faults. No bank would want perfect security to be available
directly to customers. No military or spy agency would want perfect
national security available to the citizenry. No government would
want a threat-free populace. No comsec industry would want ...
Best to aim for pretty good comsec and call it best that can
be done but cheating happens, thank you Edward Snowden,
so prepare for disaster "not if, not when, but now." Intel
committees wokring hand in hand with Snowden Inc. to keep
the public panicky and needful of secrecy protection of
the holy grail, national security backed by WMD.
In short, Tor is a confidence game, crypto is a confidence game,
no better than military, espionage, publicity, entertainment, finance,
law, insurance, education and religion. Oops those are the primary
routes to wealth and power concentration and need for WMD
What, you say WMD is a confidence game? Getoutahere, that's
top secret codeword core faith in secretkeeping. Without that
fundamental Frankensteinian fault nobody would buy security
against the Doctors of monsters working hard at most secret
laboratories on earth to devise crypto for assuring WMD comms
and launch threats are pretty good at persuading the public to
pay the steep protection fee -- which it should be noted is
laundered through IRS and NGOs, blessed by FRS and SEC.

"Also keep in mind that there are no confirmed on the record cases to
date of a Tor 'break/weakness' having been used to find a user. It
appears to be only user error."
One of the perdurable claims of comsec promoters is that comsec
breaks and weaknesses inevitably turn out to be user errors. Exactly
who the fictitious user is remains obscure but assuredly means
somebody other than the comsec promoter user who inevitably
offers a greatly improved product, trust them.
Tor is especially adept at blaming users, itself faultless except for lack
of volunteers to patch its innumerable holes (caused by clueless users),
so much so one might think that is a feature derived from the religion
of national security (actually that is its source and shows its heritage
of exculpability) which inevitably fails due to lack of funding, political
  will, public support, unwillingness of youngsters to die for officer
careers, that is customers must suffer for company profits.
Has there been a better account of inevitable exculpability for
inevitable comsec failure than that by NSA in 1998?
Still hope continues -- thanks to Edward Snowden and his legions
of inevitable comsec failure promoters:
Cyber Security Market Forecast 2014-2024: Prospects For Leading Companies in Military, Government, Critical Infrastructure & Private Sector Protection
Defence report
Cyber attacks continue to dominate the headlines, and with good reason. While the threat of cyber security is often exaggerated, there is no doubt that the enhanced networking of society has created substantial vulnerabilities lurking within its interconnected pathways. With attackers able to strike from anywhere and inflict damage on a significant (but often unnoticed) scale, the threat has never been greater to the reams of knowledge held by governments and enterprise. There is also the threat to military information sharing networks representing a significant challenge: in an era of increased integration between systems and platforms, the very webs which act as force multipliers could collapse. Efforts to counter these extensive vulnerabilities are presently ongoing to an impressive degree, and the speed of these developments is not expected to lessen unduly. As a consequence, visiongain has assessed that the value of the global Cyber Security market in 2014 will reach $76.68bn.

If NSA and GCHQ were, are, doing these alleged operations as surmised
with slightest evidence greatly amplified, cherry-picked and moshed like
a Tom Clancy hot seller, it is likely the Devil's Duo are meticulously
tracking, siphoning and implanting:
1. Those reporting, editing, checking, formatting and posting these
stories and documents from various countries and those spying all
these from inside and outside.
2. The hosting and keyservers of The Intercept, First Look and
interconnections and those spying all these from inside and outside.
3. The transceivals among the media staff, lawyers, bankers, bedmates
and those spying all these from inside and outside.
4. The comsec wizards being consulted and those they are leaking
stuff to and those spying all these from inside and outside.
5. The officials being asked for comment and their roladexes of
insiders and those spying all these from inside and outside.
6. The multiple-agencies counter-counter-intel agents double-checking
everyone involved and those spying all these from inside and outside.
7. The thousands necessarily swept up in the spiderwebs of linkages
for immediate or distant actionable operations and those spying all
these from inside and outside.
8. The other national spies working the same territories of gullible
targets armored with the world's greatest comsec protection,
no matter what ex-spies and ex-contractors claim is absolutely
dependable means to assure nobody is swiping and siphoning
and those spying all these from inside and outside.
Months, years to come, there will be even more gushings about
what has been dribbled out with insufficient context to understand
what is media hyperbole and what is worth worrying about and those
spying all these from inside and outside standards orgs, FOI
racketeering, crypto entrepreneurs of com, edu, org and
open source treacheries.
Recap: About 1,333 Snowden documents have been released by
commercial media, none for free.
Greenwald has said he gets about $1,500 per story in which he
gets a byline. Excluding the $1M signing bonus he has allegedly
got from Omidyar, he has made at least another million.
Gellman, Poitras perhaps the same (Poitras may have gotten a
similar signing bonus).
Other dozens of reporters were paid a percentage of that.
So it might be estimated the gang of reporters have garnered
some $4-5M so far.
Media outlets have probably earned 10 times that in sales and ads.
The USG, allies and enemies have probably received similar
amounts to respond to Snowden, some $50-100M.
So call it a $200-500M affair to date.
If the USG and other govs work the bonanza as predicted,
over 10-20 years the operation will generate, conservatively,
a $1-5T boost for comsec religionists and exploiters of media,
spies, universities, telcos, web operators, program peddlers,
AV magicians, games designers, not counting SM and SEOs
and spammers and botnets.
Black markets could match that amount, or multiples of it.
Meanwhile the comsec industry -- gov, mil, com, edu, org -- will
continue reaping the rewards of faith-based sin and salvation.

@_subject: Comsec as Public Utility Beyond Illusory Privacy 
Snowden may have raised the prospect of comsec as a public utility
like power, water, gas, sewage, air quality, environmental protection
and telecommunications. Privacy protection has been shown to be
illusory at best, deceptive at worst, due to the uncontrollable
technology applied erroneously for national security.
Each of the other public utilities began as private offerings before
becoming commercialized and then institutionalized as necessities,
many eventually near or wholly monopolies.
Each also evolved into military targets for control, contamination,
destruction, and in some cases excluded as too essential for
civilian livelihood to target.
Comsec as a right for human discourse rather than a commercial
service could enforce privacy beyond easy violation for official
and commercial purposes.
Freedom of comsec, say, as a new entry in the US Bill of Rights
could lead the way for it to be a fundamental element of Human
The problem will be as ever the commercial and governmental
exploiters aiming to protect their interests against that of
the public.
FCC and NIST, indeed, the three branches, are hardly reliable to
pursue this, so beholden to the spy agencies they cannot be trusted.
NSA's ubiquitous spying on everybody at home and elsewhere
with technology beyond accountability does raise the chances of
getting agreement of all targets -- gov, com, edu, org -- to say
enough is enough, national security has become a catchall for
inexcusable invasion of the public realm.

At 11:52 PM 3/13/2014, Troy Benjegerdes sigged:
Your sig: "earth::water::air::fire::mind::spirit::soul" (EWAFMSS)
pretty well covers the area of operations needing ubiquitous comsec
against ubuiquitous spying of EWAFMSS.
Certainly there will be violations and spying by those who design,
run and abuse the systems of EWAFMSS.
Especially those who are excused from accountability to "maintain
the systems, or debug" EWAFMSS.
More narrowly, system operators, network operators, maintenance
staff, repariers, holders of keys to and lockpicks of the systems, ie, the
Snowdens, the spies, the governors, will usurp control and unilaterally
or collectively decide they know what is best for the systems' users,
and that inevitably coincides with self-interest of the system operators
of EWAFMSS.
Given that inevitability of self-interest, cloaked in high-minded rationales
of public service, or national security, what inevitably must be done to
reign in the inevitable abusers of privilege, public service, national
security, ie EWAFMSS.
A range of options: assassination, revolution, counterspying, treason,
war, founding of new faiths, schemes and con jobs in EWAFMSS.
For comsec that could entail implantation of electroshock devices
in every system operator which punishes, or in extremity, kills, for
misbehavior programmed into the widgets. Hack a key, pick a lock,
mosh RNG, open a backdoor, break a vow of public service, get
singed as a warning, keep it up, get fried.
This is basicly what NSA is implanting around the globe in systems
if not witting and unwitting operators. Starting with implantation of
their own Snowdens of devices of disinformation which leads the
poor goofs to think they know the system vulns. Then the goofs
spread the disinfo to, say, the Greenwalds, Poitras's and Gellmans
who then goofily spread it to the public goofiness consumers.
Blessing this operation is the FISC judges who mightily try to
understand WTF DoJ is blowing at them to cloud what NSA is
actually doing with its systems of EWAFMSS.
Read the FISC orders to see the solons gyrate and spasm
a pretense of understanding what is intended ot be non-understandable.
NSA proceeds totally unhindered to do what it wants with abusing
EWAFMSS, condoned by FISC glossing of the abuse -- what is
done in the US is done worldwide for managing and exploiting for
self-interest EWAFMSS.
Yes, these very lists foster the appeal of exploiting the expoitation
of EWAFMSS by pretending to oppose it, to found a new scheme
of assassination, revolution, etc, etc. This will inevitably lead to
compromisable proponents to be bribed and recruited for service
in the established exploiters: billionaires, journalists, lawyers, courts,
tech corporations, telcos, LEs, TLAs, Vaticans, Israelis, Muslims,
Tea Parties, nations, black marketers, financial crime syndicates,
freedom of information hustlers, leakers, and, most beautifully
remunerative, crypto-comsec mofos.
There's the pitch for comsec public utility, crypto-comsec mofos
signing up to be implanted with EM devices for a Tor-Greenwald-grade
lifetime of comfort bribe to loyally and patriotically run the sysems of
EWAFMSS. Then immediately break the vow, hack the devices,
cheat, lie, steal, bolthole an embassy, refuge in a rogue state,
for a while enjoy the warm feeling of triumph, then be Zapped

@_subject: Comsec as Public Utility Beyond Illusory Privacy 
A point not well emphasized by cryptographers, in public at least,
and advocates of encryption as the essential requirement for
"Unbeakable crypto" may not be used as much as it once was
but there are a host of newly-minted versions of snake oilish
assurances dominating the booming comsec market, thanks
to Snowden's magnificent gift, estimated to eventually reach
the trillion dollar level in two decades, to the gov-com-edu-org
comsec panic industry.
Operators of systems, and the necessarily breachable security they
offer, remain the achilles heels of comsec. Lavabit is only one of
the instances in which sysadmins are compromised. Ubiquitous
deployment of crypto throughout telecom and cyber systems is
vulnerable to sysadmins who insist on full access to everything
to "de-bug" and run their systems, especially those SAs easily
manipulated by front offices and their ever so cooperative legal and
financial advisors. Not many SAs wil do what Snowden did in the
"public interest" which just happens to be a great fortune maker
for media and comsec hustlers.
End to end encryption is currently a hot recommendation of choice
for comsec but skips over what happens behind, below, around and
inside "end to end" code, hardware, implementation, and most of
all the traffic flow of the precious capsules emitting transceiver
vapor trails, EM clutter, arfully cloaked gaps, doors, handshakes,
implants, bugs (and "de-bugs"), ways in and out, checks, double
checks, safety plugs, sigs, nyms, language hints, and manifold
uniquenesses witting and unwitting of fallible hunks of meat.
It is, or should be, primary for cryptographers to publicly admit
cryptosystems inevitably fail, as some do despite being overridden
by sales and CEOs and investors, being bribed and NDA'd into
complicity, or in worst cases threatened with prosecution for
revealing in natsec systems built-in faults or more deviously,
pretending there are none while glossing deep deception with
shallow claims that there are always a few which can be repaired,
nothing is perfect, you get what you pay for, etc, etc, the
formulaic exculpation inherent in the word "security."
No question this is expecting cryptographers to be more honest
than the rest of the greedy "professional" class so avid to profess
public interest while gobbling the public's hard earned with gleeful
transgression slathered in "industry standards" and global treaties
to assure governments and corporations remain piggish and
dispensaries of rewards for the professional classes which
find oligarchal enticements "irresistable" as Greenwald slobbered
in agreeing to work closely with gov-com to withhold secrets
under guise of ventriloquizing Snowden's "causing no harm to
national security."
"Causing no harm to national security" is verily medieval in its
creed-promotional organized religion fervor. Cryptographers
have long been missionaries for this duplicitous "trust us" faith,
so it figures they will evangelize among journalists to adopt
encryption to upgrade the low value of the fear and trembling
scripture, and, as always, the compensation for scribes of
arcane holy writ of bare panic and crypto balm.

@_subject: Journalists Shill Sources and Secrets 
wait ... are you saying money corrupts ???
if you are saying that corruption is at hand then how can we trust the supposed human beings behind any of these names ? i mean i think you are saying corruption is at hand but i dont want to assume anything...
Assume this promotional creed screed for national security journalism:
No, media venality is not news. What is worth examining is the long-term
exploitation of "national security" as a joint gov-com-edu-org
racket to manipulate secretkeeping as a wealth concentration
industry. This has been commonplace since the national security
state was invented after WW2 and led to need for continuous
spying to manufacture enemies and to arm for diddly squat combat
against fictious foes by hugely expensive but hardly ever used
armaments. Cryptosystems among the black budgetary wastage.
In particular cryptosystem popularization (as here and its emulators)
as ostensible opposition to the national security racket, begun in the
flower-child 60s to flower wildly in the 90s and rise to a kudzu crescendo
with Snowden's operation to validate crypto use against illusory
enemies within the state, cloaked as usual by the blanket exculpt
"to do no harm to national security," then hide behind privileged
natsec journalism so dirty and complicit in govenment affairs it
needs protection from the public, so merely dribbles dainty
tidbits of threats to privacy and to advance the favorite ACLU
and EFF lawyerly fund-raising hobgobblin of constitutional
FISA Court jiggery-pokery by lawfare warriors indicates that
lawyers and judges know diddly about comsec technology
but dare not admit it and lose control of the public narrative
of threat and protection obligatory in the trillion dollar national
security hootenany which compares to organized religion of the
medieval era which ruled heaven and earth with fantasticly
frightening and pleasuring tales of evil and salvation.
Adled journalists are racing to adopt encryption as crusading
chain mail raiment, ignorant of how easily it can be penetrated,
but no matter, what will really protect the valiant journalists is
"constitutional protection," a comedy of conceit and stupidity
usually associated with court jesters.

@_subject: Skype and Crypto Pushed by Snowden a Ploy? 
In connection with using "encrypted, secure connection" Skype for
Snowden's imagery at SXSW and TED, as well as encrypted comms
with journalists and event organizers, what has led these comsec
advisors to believe that all too vulnerable Skype is secure, as well
as all too vulnerable popular crypto pushed for journalists?
Is there any indication Snowden has deployed less vulnerable
protections which have not been disclosed as backing for his
encouragement to trust encryption and to allow Skype to
finger his location and leak his comms?
To be sure, many of his remarks seem to be carefully scripted
for low-brow consumption characteristic of journalism. So there
may be a secure back-channel being used with Skype and pop
crypto as diversion.
The low-brow slides, clips, short docs, redactions released by the
media point to a deception of some sort yet to be disclosed until
25 years has passed. Hyperventilating press accounts of the
releases suggest either deception, inexperience or technical
ignorance or all.
Still, that kind of misleading comsec deception would be commonplace
security measures characterisitic of NSA and wizards -- to induce the
flock to churn massive amount publicity about encrypted comms --
and Skype -- to camouflage the Tor, blacker and deeper comms,
not to say the even blacker and deeper tools not seen by Snowden
or not yet released.
More sopisticated would be to use the small amount of NSA releases
to cloak far greater distribution (a method used by WikiLeaks and
the black market as well as the spy industry). That too would closer
to what the big boys and girls do, and therefore would be exactly what
they are watching for. Including watching for ploys to hide ploys.

@_subject: Compromised Sys Admin Hunters and Tor 
Sys admins catch you hunting them and arrange compromises
to fit your demands so you can crow about how skilled you are.
Then you hire them after being duped as you duped to be hired.
The lead Tor designer reportedly (via Washington Post) had a
session with NSA to brief on how to compromise it, although
"compromise" was not used nor is the word used by
Not many honest comsec wizards nowadays are promising
more than compromised comsec, and the compromise is gradually
increasing as Snowden material is dribbled out to convince the
public and wizards not a hell of a lot can be done about it except
believe in and buy more compromised comsec.
Not news here and in comsec wizard-land, to be sure, but
compromised comsec is the industry standard, as the industry
and its wizards in and out of government enjoy the boom and
bust in comsec tools generated by precursors of Snowden,
Snowden and his successors.
Compromisability is assumed by the comsec industry to be a
fundamental feature in all nations, no need to advertise it, much
better to advertise how great comsec is and now much it is
needed. Crypto-wizards have a long history of compromising
believers who hire them and who suffer their promises of
highly trusted protection.
Trusted comsec is necessary to get persons to pack their
comms with compromisable information. The greater the
trust the greater the revelations of just what is desired.
So what if laws are aleays jiggered to allow access to the
revelations "under legal pressure" and "FISC orders."
That has been a fundamental feature of crypto and
comsec wizardry.

@_subject: To Tor or not to Tor? 
Ubiquitous use of a comsec system is a vulnerability, whether
PGP or Tor or another popular means. Crypto advocates and
Tor encourage widespread use as a defense but may be luring
victims into traps. The more users of a system the more likely
it will be attacked by officials or by malefactors. And the attacks
are most often overlooked in the volume, or excused as a price
of popularity, fixes underway, always underway, keeping coders
and investors happy as engineers mud-wrestling and financiers
Most trusted systems (MTS) are where the money is, as with banks,
so that's where robbers make their living, and MTS set up budgets
for loss, PR, lobbying, training staff in cover-ups and workarounds,
hiring ex-regulators and distinguished industry leaders as advisors,
board members and faces of the MTS around the planet.
The lucrative boomlet in comsec generated by Snowden Inc's
marketing gambit promoting encryption and enhanced comsec
among media mouthpiece megaphones indicates that another
cycle of dubity of the status quo comsec confidence game is
to be followed by a repair and rejigger protection racket,
as evidenced on these mail lists, at conferences, and no doubt
in halls of semi-classified exchanges everready to share tips
and tricks to ratchet up demand for security in all its devilish
Was it not mere months ago when a call was issued to redesign
and or replace the entire Internet from top to bottom, the whole
thing, to end the futile comsec tinkering and delusionary marketing,
no way the Frankenstein could be made secure for human use,
it had fundamental faults which precluded durable comsec.
Perhaps re-Frankensteining is being done in semi-classified
halls, hindered by by official and commercial and scholarly
exploiters of the monster's faults to advance their interests
in advocating MTS for public use, just keep those research
and investment funds flowing.
No risk, no security market, so what fool would want an Internet that
had no faults. No bank would want perfect security to be available
directly to customers. No military or spy agency would want perfect
national security available to the citizenry. No government would
want a threat-free populace. No comsec industry would want ...
Best to aim for pretty good comsec and call it best that can
be done but cheating happens, thank you Edward Snowden,
so prepare for disaster "not if, not when, but now." Intel
committees wokring hand in hand with Snowden Inc. to keep
the public panicky and needful of secrecy protection of
the holy grail, national security backed by WMD.
In short, Tor is a confidence game, crypto is a confidence game,
no better than military, espionage, publicity, entertainment, finance,
law, insurance, education and religion. Oops those are the primary
routes to wealth and power concentration and need for WMD
What, you say WMD is a confidence game? Getoutahere, that's
top secret codeword core faith in secretkeeping. Without that
fundamental Frankensteinian fault nobody would buy security
against the Doctors of monsters working hard at most secret
laboratories on earth to devise crypto for assuring WMD comms
and launch threats are pretty good at persuading the public to
pay the steep protection fee -- which it should be noted is
laundered through IRS and NGOs, blessed by FRS and SEC.
Damn 3 lettered agencies of God.

We've seen the Greenwald book No Place to Hide, where are the
promised gush of Snowden documents available? His publisher
doesn't show a source. Surely not another marketing tease.
Surely not snatched by the TLAs, tampered with, doctored,
MTM'd, redacted, censored, cherry-picked, highlighted for
dummies and fans, surely not handled like a disinfo spy
op, heavy on narrative, suggestions of much more unreleasable,
need for classified briefings and diligent vetting, that what
we documents censors know we can't dare tell the public
due to the public dupery by enemies of our interests.
Dropboxes are honey pots, media is just that, governments
are just that, opsec and comsec are just that.
And do tell, what is this SIGINT forum psyoping?

There is a good chance the documents are covertly marked as
you suggest, the ostentatious classification markings a ruse for
untutored yokels to fancy are genuine.
Covert markings have been in use for a long time, as well as
ostentatious markings. On paper as well as digital and other
forms of electronic.
And certainly packets carry unique markings in a variety of
overt and covert types.
Some of the techniques fall under the inadvertent emanations
rubric associated with Tempest -- which has blossomed well
beyond the FOIA releases from the late 1990s. TSCM is a
marvel of duplicity and ruse.

This is hardly new, indeed is as old as governments and their
precursor "lawful" rulers of the populace which cannot be
trusted with anarchic self-rule, much less armed with treasonous
cryptoanarchy for absolute right to privacy from rulers.
Even this list of rogues was founded and struggles to survive on
its impossible mission to resist this ancient history and current

Significantly for this clan, comsec remains an essential tool
for attacking and protecting. It annoys the masters of comsec
no end for rogues to mess with their command and control
communications and ubiquitous civic spying operations.
It requires recruitment of comsec rogues to mess with rogues,
as amply demonstrated here and other security fora where
coders and hackers are prime candidates for quietly switching
sides, remaining in place, covertly informing, sabotaging,
implanting, faulting, I/O erroring, pretending opposition to the

counseling dissidents, whistling Dixie for media and audiences,
advocating openness, disclosing shallow vulns to hide

This list goes on, as evidenced here and on the gobs of
freedom of information outlets which have spread as widely
as the Internet, black net, deep net, chats, OTRs, Tor, and
now cellphone webs and swarms of earnest instigators
indistinguishable from TLAs taking 100% and giving back

@_subject: [Cryptography] $750k Fine for exporting crypto 
The global internal rot of digital technology dependence appears doing
quite well by inducing ever greater investment and reliance upon
it. Will over-reliance upon secret cryptography be its Achilles heel?
Let us hope so.
Conumdrum is that wholesale monitoring is the result of ubiquitous
digital technology, networks and programs thickly hidden by secret
cryptography, thinly protected, if at all, by never quite effective public
cryptography, ineffective by law by design, by implementation and
by endless excuses to do better next time.
The correlation between the rise of the Internet to advance global
surveillance and public cryptography to persuade the populace there
is hope the surveillance can be countered, is occasionally noted
but not by cryptography fetishists who promote the notion it is possible
to have a global platform of diverse levels for multiple open and
secret uses but still protect at least a few of the levels with encryption.
This despite the legacy of cryptography as a deceptive technology
through and through and foremost, in particular by misleading about
its strengths and weaknesses, its treachery and double-dealing, its
cheating and betraying, its false promises and "confessed" failures.
No doubt all forms of security share these characteristics, eventual
failure is the fundamental outcome of a security system subject to
ceaseless attack. Every fortress fails, every weapon is surpassed,
every peace treaty is transgressed, every ideology collapses, every
nation is overturned; in all cases by excessive conviction that failure
will not happen, and when it does, it occurs by the least expected
means. After a few attempts to repair the majestic defense and
prolong a regime, it finally implodes most often due to internal
rot of those unable to give up comfortable convictions that munitions
are invulnerable, that supreme command and control is protected
against tampering, that oaths and rewards of fealty to the homeland
are insurpassable. Except for the planted cheats of anonymizers
and encryption.

Call for publication of all Snowden papers gets louder
The Amsterdam Media Professor Geert Lovink left no doubt that in his opinion the medium term, the entire treasure of the NSA Whistleblowers must be made and archived publicly. Such an approach has a very different range than the global 24-hour news machine. "Journalists want to make headlines and politics", was the founder of the Institute of Network Cultures . But it was important to think long-term.
The Snowden-papers offer unique insight into a loud Lovink "information-military complex in the making": They showed roughly, "who are the actors and what technologies they use." In addition, they made different impact of monitoring on individual countries or regions significantly and who personally was affected as a group or society. Taken together, this was "for all investigative journalists around the world for decades interesting".
Ruf nach Veröffentlichung der Snowden-Papiere wird lauter
Der Amsterdamer Medienprofessor Geert Lovink ließ keinen Zweifel daran, dass seiner Meinung nach mittelfristig der gesamte Schatz des NSA-Whistleblowers öffentlich gemacht und archiviert werden müsse. Eine solche Herangehensweise habe eine ganz andere Reichweite als die globale 24-Stunden-Nachrichtenmaschinerie. "Journalisten wollen Schlagzeilen und Politik machen", befand der Gründer des Institute of Network Cultures. Es gelte aber, langfristiger zu denken.
Die Snowden-Papiere bieten laut Lovink einzigartige Einsicht in einen "informations-militärischen Komplex im Werden": Sie zeigten etwa auf, "wer die Akteure sind und welche Technologien sie nutzen". Darüber hinaus machten sie unterschiedliche Auswirkungen der Überwachung auf einzelne Länder oder Regionen deutlich und wer persönlich, als Gruppe oder Gesellschaft betroffen sei. Zusammengenommen sei dies "für alle investigativen Journalisten weltweit über Jahrzehnte hinweg interessant".

Reader asks: What Is Good Encryption Software?
I have contacted you asking about certain security questions.
After reading a few of the Snowden leaked documents, I have
started to be more aware of my privacy being at risk. I have a
few questions concerning certain programs and safety tips.
First, I've recently started to doubt about my encryption software.
Is Symantec's "PGP Endpoint" a good hard drive encryption software?
In other words, is it trustworthy since it is an American company.
And if not, what encryption software is the best for Mac.
Second, is "ProtonMail" as secure as they say it is? If not, what
email provider doesen't let the NSA see into my account.
Third, is Jetico inc's "Bestcrypt Container Encryption" trustworthy?
If not, what could be an alternative.
Fourth, are these encryption types good? Blowfish, Gost & AES - 256bit.
And which encryption type remains the best above all?
Last, is Kaspersky a good anti-virus software? If not, which one is the
best for Mac.
Important, difficult questions, likely to produce a range of answers.
We will publish for answers.

@_subject: Encryption Experts and Snake Oilers Quacking Like Governments 
Capitalizing on the comsec frenzy, several sites, probably many,
are offering to encrypt for those who do not want install programs
or find them too difficult to use. All appear to promise that no
records, private and public keys, email addresses or content
will be kept. Trust them.
For example, here's one used to send encrypted messages:
This approach suggests that the renewed crypto wars have again
bred a new round of opportunities to beguile those who yearn for
comsec but do not know how to get it, nor how to evaluate the
offerings, in particular those provided by US producers which they
doubt are free of government manipulation. But they also doubt that
any cryptosystem is free of that, thanks to the NSA revelations of
global cooperation among nations to do what NSA does, and the
failure of crypto experts and firms to fully disclose their aid to
governments, before and after Snowden's revelations.
So the downside of Snowden's revelations is that there is considerable
suspicion that all crypto is compromised, and, worse, that snake oil
is not really different from the good stuff for the ordinary user who lacks
the technical skills to distinguish them. And that comsec experts are
in league with authorities to dupe the public by excessive warning
of snake oil to peddle their own offerings, that is, experts and
snake oilers are doing what governments do.
Trust Snowden, trust experts, trust governments, but distrust
snake oil. Wait, users say, how can we tell the difference when
they all quack like ducks.

The global internal rot of digital technology dependence appears doing
quite well by inducing ever greater investment and reliance upon
it. Will over-reliance upon secret cryptography be its Achilles heel?
Let us hope so.
Conumdrum is that wholesale monitoring is the result of ubiquitous
digital technology, networks and programs thickly hidden by secret
cryptography, thinly protected, if at all, by never quite effective public
cryptography, ineffective by law by design, by implementation and
by endless excuses to do better next time.
The correlation between the rise of the Internet to advance global
surveillance and public cryptography to persuade the populace there
is hope the surveillance can be countered, is occasionally noted
but not by cryptography fetishists who promote the notion it is possible
to have a global platform of diverse levels for multiple open and
secret uses but still protect at least a few of the levels with encryption.
This despite the legacy of cryptography as a deceptive technology
through and through and foremost, in particular by misleading about
its strengths and weaknesses, its treachery and double-dealing, its
cheating and betraying, its false promises and "confessed" failures.
No doubt all forms of security share these characteristics, eventual
failure is the fundamental outcome of a security system subject to
ceaseless attack. Every fortress fails, every weapon is surpassed,
every peace treaty is transgressed, every ideology collapses, every
nation is overturned; in all cases by excessive conviction that failure
will not happen, and when it does, it occurs by the least expected
means. After a few attempts to repair the majestic defense and
prolong a regime, it finally implodes most often due to internal
rot of those unable to give up comfortable convictions that munitions
are invulnerable, that supreme command and control is protected
against tampering, that oaths and rewards of fealty to the homeland
are insurpassable. Except for the planted cheats of anonymizers
and encryption.

Call for publication of all Snowden papers gets louder
The Amsterdam Media Professor Geert Lovink left no doubt that in his opinion the medium term, the entire treasure of the NSA Whistleblowers must be made and archived publicly. Such an approach has a very different range than the global 24-hour news machine. "Journalists want to make headlines and politics", was the founder of the Institute of Network Cultures . But it was important to think long-term.
The Snowden-papers offer unique insight into a loud Lovink "information-military complex in the making": They showed roughly, "who are the actors and what technologies they use." In addition, they made different impact of monitoring on individual countries or regions significantly and who personally was affected as a group or society. Taken together, this was "for all investigative journalists around the world for decades interesting".
Ruf nach Veröffentlichung der Snowden-Papiere wird lauter
Der Amsterdamer Medienprofessor Geert Lovink ließ keinen Zweifel daran, dass seiner Meinung nach mittelfristig der gesamte Schatz des NSA-Whistleblowers öffentlich gemacht und archiviert werden müsse. Eine solche Herangehensweise habe eine ganz andere Reichweite als die globale 24-Stunden-Nachrichtenmaschinerie. "Journalisten wollen Schlagzeilen und Politik machen", befand der Gründer des Institute of Network Cultures. Es gelte aber, langfristiger zu denken.
Die Snowden-Papiere bieten laut Lovink einzigartige Einsicht in einen "informations-militärischen Komplex im Werden": Sie zeigten etwa auf, "wer die Akteure sind und welche Technologien sie nutzen". Darüber hinaus machten sie unterschiedliche Auswirkungen der Überwachung auf einzelne Länder oder Regionen deutlich und wer persönlich, als Gruppe oder Gesellschaft betroffen sei. Zusammengenommen sei dies "für alle investigativen Journalisten weltweit über Jahrzehnte hinweg interessant".

I have contacted you asking about certain security questions.
After reading a few of the Snowden leaked documents, I have
started to be more aware of my privacy being at risk. I have a
few questions concerning certain programs and safety tips.
First, I've recently started to doubt about my encryption software.
Is Symantec's "PGP Endpoint" a good hard drive encryption software?
In other words, is it trustworthy since it is an American company.
And if not, what encryption software is the best for Mac.
Second, is "ProtonMail" as secure as they say it is? If not, what
email provider doesen't let the NSA see into my account.
Third, is Jetico inc's "Bestcrypt Container Encryption" trustworthy?
If not, what could be an alternative.
Fourth, are these encryption types good? Blowfish, Gost & AES - 256bit.
And which encryption type remains the best above all?
Last, is Kaspersky a good anti-virus software? If not, which one is the
best for Mac.
Important, difficult questions, likely to produce a range of answers.
We will publish for answers.

Capitalizing on the comsec frenzy, several sites, probably many,
are offering to encrypt for those who do not want install programs
or find them too difficult to use. All appear to promise that no
records, private and public keys, email addresses or content
will be kept. Trust them.
For example, here's one used to send encrypted messages:
This approach suggests that the renewed crypto wars have again
bred a new round of opportunities to beguile those who yearn for
comsec but do not know how to get it, nor how to evaluate the
offerings, in particular those provided by US producers which they
doubt are free of government manipulation. But they also doubt that
any cryptosystem is free of that, thanks to the NSA revelations of
global cooperation among nations to do what NSA does, and the
failure of crypto experts and firms to fully disclose their aid to
governments, before and after Snowden's revelations.
So the downside of Snowden's revelations is that there is considerable
suspicion that all crypto is compromised, and, worse, that snake oil
is not really different from the good stuff for the ordinary user who lacks
the technical skills to distinguish them. And that comsec experts are
in league with authorities to dupe the public by excessive warning
of snake oil to peddle their own offerings, that is, experts and
snake oilers are doing what governments do.
Trust Snowden, trust experts, trust governments, but distrust
snake oil. Wait, users say, how can we tell the difference when

adopting signature schemes that do not need to record information

"Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write

of the software we write. We know that software can't be destroyed
and that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down.
Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption
is fundamentally a private act. The act of encryption, in fact, removes
information from the public realm. Even laws against cryptography
reach only so far as a nation's border and the arm of its violence.
Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and with
it the anonymous transactions systems that it makes possible.
For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract.
People must come and together deploy these systems for the
common good. Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of
one's fellows in society. We the Cypherpunks seek your questions

This John Young corrects a data point: 97% of some 59,000
Snowden documents have not been released or even less
percentage if the DoD count of 1.7 million is used. This confirms
that those documents which have been released are misleading
by omission, so cherry-picked and dramatized that understanding
of them is most likely false, biased, distorted, more like narrative
fiction (spy stories, breaking news) than credible evidence. It
certainly confirms that media-legal fiction is the intention of the
distributors, publicity and legal teams rather than allow full
access for widely-based, for ordinary and specialized readers
to assay the collection through a free public access methodology.
(Greenwald's book states that at one point he and Poitras
considered setting up a public web for that purpose, maybe
apochryphal to gloss the slow drip method adopted.)
Perhaps the full access will come about after sacred cow
of profitability and celebrity has been milked, or it may be
that full access has been granted in confidence to skilled
readers in the black arts of comsec, infosec and natsec.
To date, there has been slim pickings of technologically
useful material short-shrifted in favor of lurid civil liberties
scandals which the spies can easily massage into messages
of of course we do that. Except for a tranche of techno
material covered by Jacob Appelbaum at 30C3, nearly
all the rest is simple-minded promotional material with
dollops of legal shenanigans of the sort Greenwald and
journalists can handle comfortably.
A few days ago Bruce Schneier blogged that he had
been cut off from access to the Snowden material
and Matthew Green said he had been shown only a
few documents for comment. WaPo has had a techie
advising Barton Gellman. That's pretty much it for
coverage of technical material needed to devise
countermeasures, that is, virtually none at all.
Hoopla has prevailed in news coverage and books, mostly
of it valorizing journalists and even Snowden in stock journalist
source noble cariacture, and it looks as though Poitras
and Hollywood will continue the practice. What an
ethical shame, what criminality of monetization ($250M and

Not likely you will see the list if it exists. Magical lists are as
venerable as religion, as new as Snowden's teams' hyperbole, as
duplictious as Joe McCarthy's, as puerile as IRS's -- the USA's
premier social media spy agency to which we annually confess and
conceal our paltry lies with tax-advisories which covertly supply our
cheating metadata right into the IRS's and treaty members' big data
global catchall far more capacious than Utah Data Center, feared
as much by individual spies as other panopticked extortion
victims. This sidebar to remind NSA secrecy is hardly the great
threat to "personally identifiable information" (PII).
There is a practice of government agencies and some others
to not publish (PII) of individuals. So email addresses, homes,
phone and SSNs are usually redacted. Except when used
to coerce obedience, inform on targets, shame in public.
The Washington Post said it searched 200,000 pages of
Snowden material in search of a bit of data which it reported.
Why brag of the number? That's hyperbole. This number of
pages seems to be far more than the 59,000 or so files asserted
by The Guardian, but that is unclear due the lack of number of
pages in the 59,000 "files" or "documents." We have tallied a
few under 3,000 pages released by the various Snowden outlets.
Promis is a controversial program and is slathered with myths
and disinfo, as camouflage and propaganda for and against
its use and capabilities, as customary for villainous operations.
There is a continuing lucrative industry to chill democratic
transparency with layers of braggadacio, denial, lying and
pretense of threat and counterthreat. Uncertainty about who
is spying on you is the purpose, and to stigmatize you if you
inquire too persistently. Out comes the bellows of "conspiracy
theory," "tin-hats," paranoids, weirdos and such.
Public deception is a perdurable feature of spying and power
concentration. Shallow layers of expose, fed to media with
the understanding it will flatter itself by behaving "responsibly"
in order to assure future feedings, is part of that. That is
part of the Snowden methodology and is a highly favored
journalistic practice to melodramatically claim to know more
than can be revealed while exaggerating the courage to reveal
what it does while protecting the public interest (thus emulating
government and other authoritarian practice).
Reviews of Citizenfour are cautious, not sure what to make
of the careful editing and omissions. They sense, and say
so, there is much still missing. Poitras is saying just that:
this is "not the full story" by "any stretch of the imagination."
This is a Hollywood technique likely imposed on her by
the film's backers. Which will economically segue nicely
into the Oliver Stone's and whatitsname's makeover
in the works.
You can get your appeal to First Look and/or Greenwald by
linking to their Twitter accounts your message in the cpunks
archive. We use that SM hyperbole occasionally and they
use it voluminously.

I had not followed GamerGate until today's New York Times
article about it. Nor followed games, so the controversy is
new to me. But not the issues involved, which are prevalent
online and off. Particularly in testosterone-rich enterprises like
military, spies, armaments, sports, weapons, ideology,
religion, education, society, civilization, humanity, existence
itself. In all of these, the stronger violently dominate the
weaker and do so with the psychotic belief that this is
the way it should be, natural.
In war and peace, in human exploitation of animal and earthly
domains, in climate degradation, in force-feeding "democracy,"
in cruel treatment of women's bodies and neglect of children,
in just about every aspect of torturous "advancements in
civilized peoples" in the course of inventing and applying
ever greater and more vicious ways to kill, maim, starve
and over-populate earthlings by male rape in all guises
of wargames.
Games are a reflection of the this much greater conceit
of male dominance in all institutions, all of them, even those
which spout diversity and affirmative action and grant minimal
access to privileged male sanctuaries -- no matter the skin
color, ethnicity, faith, location on earth.
It is argued that male aggression inherent and can at best
be somewhat controlled by law and social compact. That is
a comfortable apologia by male supremacists in law and
social compacts dominated by them with intellectual and
economic arrogance. All institutions measure accomplishment
by male-derived standards to tip the balance in favor of those
rigged games.
GameGate is too limited in scope, so much that it should
be seen as a male-dominated diversion, a game, to avoid
addressing the origin and sustaining influence of male
way of thinking, doing, making, competing, surviving, by
lying, cheating, killing, ruling in all aspects of existence,
simulated in games, trained for in games, monetized by
games designers and producers, applauded and lauded
in halls of power and control, in prizes and awards, in
cemetaries and statues, in art and science, in accumulation
concentration and monopolization of wealth.
No game this larger world, this wargame of "ballsy"
potentates in military, policy, spying, media, sports,
taxation, playing obsessively the "law of men enforced

Not likely you will see the list if it exists. Magical lists are as
venerable as religion, as new as Snowden's teams' hyperbole, as
duplictious as Joe McCarthy's, as puerile as IRS's -- the USA's
premier social media spy agency to which we annually confess and
conceal our paltry lies with tax-advisories which covertly supply our
cheating metadata right into the IRS's and treaty members' big data
global catchall far more capacious than Utah Data Center, feared
as much by individual spies as other panopticked extortion
victims. This sidebar to remind NSA secrecy is hardly the great
threat to "personally identifiable information" (PII).
There is a practice of government agencies and some others
to not publish (PII) of individuals. So email addresses, homes,
phone and SSNs are usually redacted. Except when used
to coerce obedience, inform on targets, shame in public.
The Washington Post said it searched 200,000 pages of
Snowden material in search of a bit of data which it reported.
Why brag of the number? That's hyperbole. This number of
pages seems to be far more than the 59,000 or so files asserted
by The Guardian, but that is unclear due the lack of number of
pages in the 59,000 "files" or "documents." We have tallied a
few under 3,000 pages released by the various Snowden outlets.
Promis is a controversial program and is slathered with myths
and disinfo, as camouflage and propaganda for and against
its use and capabilities, as customary for villainous operations.
There is a continuing lucrative industry to chill democratic
transparency with layers of braggadacio, denial, lying and
pretense of threat and counterthreat. Uncertainty about who
is spying on you is the purpose, and to stigmatize you if you
inquire too persistently. Out comes the bellows of "conspiracy
theory," "tin-hats," paranoids, weirdos and such.
Public deception is a perdurable feature of spying and power
concentration. Shallow layers of expose, fed to media with
the understanding it will flatter itself by behaving "responsibly"
in order to assure future feedings, is part of that. That is
part of the Snowden methodology and is a highly favored
journalistic practice to melodramatically claim to know more
than can be revealed while exaggerating the courage to reveal
what it does while protecting the public interest (thus emulating
government and other authoritarian practice).
Reviews of Citizenfour are cautious, not sure what to make
of the careful editing and omissions. They sense, and say
so, there is much still missing. Poitras is saying just that:
this is "not the full story" by "any stretch of the imagination."
This is a Hollywood technique likely imposed on her by
the film's backers. Which will economically segue nicely
into the Oliver Stone's and whatitsname's makeover
in the works.

I had not followed GamerGate until today's New York Times
article about it. Nor followed games, so the controversy is
new to me. But not the issues involved, which are prevalent
online and off. Particularly in testosterone-rich enterprises like
military, spies, armaments, sports, weapons, ideology,
religion, education, society, civilization, humanity, existence
itself. In all of these, the stronger violently dominate the
weaker and do so with the psychotic belief that this is
the way it should be, natural.
In war and peace, in human exploitation of animal and earthly
domains, in climate degradation, in force-feeding "democracy,"
in cruel treatment of women's bodies and neglect of children,
in just about every aspect of torturous "advancements in
civilized peoples" in the course of inventing and applying
ever greater and more vicious ways to kill, maim, starve
and over-populate earthlings by male rape in all guises
of wargames.
Games are a reflection of the this much greater conceit
of male dominance in all institutions, all of them, even those
which spout diversity and affirmative action and grant minimal
access to privileged male sanctuaries -- no matter the skin
color, ethnicity, faith, location on earth.
It is argued that male aggression inherent and can at best
be somewhat controlled by law and social compact. That is
a comfortable apologia by male supremacists in law and
social compacts dominated by them with intellectual and
economic arrogance. All institutions measure accomplishment
by male-derived standards to tip the balance in favor of those
rigged games.
GameGate is too limited in scope, so much that it should
be seen as a male-dominated diversion, a game, to avoid
addressing the origin and sustaining influence of male
way of thinking, doing, making, competing, surviving, by
lying, cheating, killing, ruling in all aspects of existence,
simulated in games, trained for in games, monetized by
games designers and producers, applauded and lauded
in halls of power and control, in prizes and awards, in
cemetaries and statues, in art and science, in accumulation
concentration and monopolization of wealth.
No game this larger world, this wargame of "ballsy"
potentates in military, policy, spying, media, sports,
taxation, playing obsessively the "law of men enforced
by lawmen."

Special note to law-enforcement agents: The word "state" is
a technical term in cryptography. Typical hash-based signature
schemes need to record information, called "state", after every
signature. Google's Adam Langley refers to this as a "huge
foot-cannon" from a security perspective. By saying "eliminate
the state" we are advocating a security improvement, namely
adopting signature schemes that do not need to record information
after every signature. We are not talking about eliminating other
types of states. We love most states, especially yours! Also,
"hash" is another technical term and has nothing to do with cannabis.

While this may be an insult to cypherpunks cryptoanarchical origins
it could be saluatory to occasionally set aside state perfidy to look
more closely at the private sector which reaps most rewards from
state obsequiousness toward industry, politicians and their backers
of wealth and the "non-profit" organizational tools of the wealthy, from
mendacious very smark and crafty individuals, particularly in comsec
and infosec and above all else, natsec and anti-natsec, out to work
all sides by getting in bed with all of them, serially and simultaneously.
Private sector spit swappers are as ubiquitous and deceptive as
privacy policies, anonymizers, backdoor coders, covert device
implanters and highly reputable hustlers of public interest, the
skilled and avid publicity seekers avowing protection of the populace
against exploitive gov-com-edu-org-religion hoodlums.
Under cover, over cover, these wily coyotes switch allegiances
like hipster clothing and manufacture bar-pickup promises: take back
the net, https everwhere, fight the spies, lengthy-key encryption and
shyster key sharing, anon-routers and deep black statelessness,
black white and gray products boundlessly offered free to siphon user
data then paid for dearly by black market buyers, then blame the foreign
hackers cover-up aided by AV predators press releasing APT
proofs of countermeasures marketability right here.
What with the profileration of trade schools for coding mastery
in a few weeks, there is quick money to pound the rat button for
more hack, privacy and comsec attacks, more calls for intervention
by everybody everywhere to Ebolaize cyber plagues beyond control.
Against profitably orchestrated terrorism and disease panic attacks
Cypherpunks said it then, avow it now:
"Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write
software to defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless
we all do, we're going to write it. We publish our code so that our
fellow Cypherpunks may practice and play with it. Our code is free
for all to use, worldwide. We don't much care if you don't approve
of the software we write. We know that software can't be destroyed
and that a widely dispersed system can't be shut down.
Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption
is fundamentally a private act. The act of encryption, in fact, removes
information from the public realm. Even laws against cryptography
reach only so far as a nation's border and the arm of its violence.
Cryptography will ineluctably spread over the whole globe, and with
it the anonymous transactions systems that it makes possible.
For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract.
People must come and together deploy these systems for the
common good. Privacy only extends so far as the cooperation of
one's fellows in society. We the Cypherpunks seek your questions
and your concerns and hope we may engage you so that we do
not deceive ourselves. We will not, however, be moved out of
our course because some may disagree with our goals.
The Cypherpunks are actively engaged in making the networks

This John Young corrects a data point: 97% of some 59,000
Snowden documents have not been released or even less
percentage if the DoD count of 1.7 million is used. This confirms
that those documents which have been released are misleading
by omission, so cherry-picked and dramatized that understanding
of them is most likely false, biased, distorted, more like narrative
fiction (spy stories, breaking news) than credible evidence. It
certainly confirms that media-legal fiction is the intention of the
distributors, publicity and legal teams rather than allow full
access for widely-based, for ordinary and specialized readers
to assay the collection through a free public access methodology.
(Greenwald's book states that at one point he and Poitras
considered setting up a public web for that purpose, maybe
apochryphal to gloss the slow drip method adopted.)
Perhaps the full access will come about after sacred cow
of profitability and celebrity has been milked, or it may be
that full access has been granted in confidence to skilled
readers in the black arts of comsec, infosec and natsec.
To date, there has been slim pickings of technologically
useful material short-shrifted in favor of lurid civil liberties
scandals which the spies can easily massage into messages
of of course we do that. Except for a tranche of techno
material covered by Jacob Appelbaum at 30C3, nearly
all the rest is simple-minded promotional material with
dollops of legal shenanigans of the sort Greenwald and
journalists can handle comfortably.
A few days ago Bruce Schneier blogged that he had
been cut off from access to the Snowden material
and Matthew Green said he had been shown only a
few documents for comment. WaPo has had a techie
advising Barton Gellman. That's pretty much it for
coverage of technical material needed to devise
countermeasures, that is, virtually none at all.
Hoopla has prevailed in news coverage and books, mostly
of it valorizing journalists and even Snowden in stock journalist

Not showing dead bodies of warfare helps sustain wars.
Defense Dept doesn't want them shown so public will
support sanitized war. News media doesn't want to show
them so advertizers can show ads which seduce the
public to wanting only sanitized news and war.
Those who profit from sanitized war and news want to
thrill the public with sanitized gore and business glory.
Every war has a sanitization business supporting it,
hiding carnage, cadavers, maimed, insane with
film, books, video, literature, education, religion,
and popular entertainers who valorize bloodthirstiness
and cruelty, venality and greed with sanitized cariatures,
games, parades, medals, cemetaries, monuments,
pensions, vet hospitals, thanks for service.
That way those who have experience actual war can
find nobody who has not who can understand anything
except the sanitized version. Grieving survivors can
find nobody to grasp what they suffer. Traumatized
vets wander among the sanitized zombies, whacking
a few, noticing that none of the other zombies care
a bit, dreaming this Django will end, this Dirty War
will end, sure, take a photo of me with the ghoul,
give me a Pulitzer, an Oscar, an Snowden factory

The NYT-Propublica is an informative and impressive release,
in many ways better than previous. It expands on the earlier

in gaps. A good sign the holders of the balance of the Snowden
dump are digging deeper and learning how convey a fuller picture

from some Snowden withholders there may be handoffs to
technologists separate from the public. Schneier, Matthew
Green, a few other comsec wizards aiding publishers have
said as much.)
Hardly complete to be sure, with about 10% of the dump
published, with plenty of gaps indicated by jumps in narratives
and still too many redactions -- presumably the result of
consulting with officials as heretofore disclosed, or due to
Snowen's instructions about what to withhold, either to
"avoid national security harm" or in expectation US prosecutors

missing with emphasis still on slide shows and textual
summaries -- most likely to satisfy the public rather than
technologists at home and national opponents.

issues remaining in the forefront of released documents
and much more so for the journalistic accounts.
It might be surmised that staying away from technology

warn the enemy of what's in store without disclosing
information to defend against it.
In particular, Snowden's and associates harping on the
need for widespread, strong encryption use, even though
the documents show how the spies bypass it, undermine it,

chips, OSes, routers, nodes, cable stations, server farms,
teleco hubs, virtually everywhere in the global system as
shown in this latest release) should be taken as a warning

This suggests reliance upon encryption may be a decoy to

The tremendous rush to market cybersecurity means and
methods for public consumption, combined with 5-Eyes
outreach to industry for means and methods to defeat

Whether Snowden is more of a hero to the public than to

CNSS Advisory Memo on Use of Public Standards for Secure Sharing of Information Among NatSec Systems 08/11/15
This Advisory expands on the guidance contained in CNSS Policy No. 15, National Information Assurance Policy on the Use of Public Standards for the Secure Sharing of Information Among National Security Systems (Reference a). Based on analysis of the effect of quantum computing on Information Assurance (IA) and IA-enabled Information Technology (IT) products, the policy's set of authorized algorithms is expanded to provide vendors and IT users more near-term flexibility in meeting their IA interoperability requirements. The purpose behind this additional flexibility is to avoid vendors and customers making two major transitions in a relatively short timeframe, as we anticipate a need to shift to quantum-resistant cryptography in the near future.

Nothing wrong with being scriptedly misleading, that is what media

Nor anything misleading about promising strong encryption and
surefire cybersecurity, despite repeated failures, backtracks,
apologias, tweakings, full disclosures, that is what they do "because
the enemy does" and "we're doing the best we can." No, not national
defense grade protection, are you nuts, RTFM.
Nor is it misleading about civil liberty, privacy policy, anonymization,
open source, HTTPS, the current cipher-sec civil-lib kaboodle.

Well said on skepticism of news reports concerning crypto, comsec,

survival, and best, most reliable, most trusted are typical tools of
misleading exploitation.
Where a single means and method, such as crypto (or science), is
encouraged for rock-solid assurance, at least one other means and
methods should be employed which in no way depends upon the
single means. Hoodwink wins by cheating.
A single means is certain to be continously under attack, and its
vulnerabilities concealed both by the attackers and by the promoters.
Blind faith in a single means is as old as religion, art and royalty, perhaps
as old as humans faced with unending threats from nature and

CNSS Advisory Memo on Use of Public Standards for Secure Sharing of Information Among NatSec Systems 08/11/15
This Advisory expands on the guidance contained in CNSS Policy No. 15, National Information Assurance Policy on the Use of Public Standards for the Secure Sharing of Information Among National Security Systems (Reference a). Based on analysis of the effect of quantum computing on Information Assurance (IA) and IA-enabled Information Technology (IT) products, the policy's set of authorized algorithms is expanded to provide vendors and IT users more near-term flexibility in meeting their IA interoperability requirements. The purpose behind this additional flexibility is to avoid vendors and customers making two major transitions in a relatively short timeframe, as we anticipate a need to shift to quantum-resistant cryptography in the near future.

Law will always be bent to favor authorities, that is what law
does and why lawyers are given special protection and privileges
not given to the citizenry. What NSA, ATT, Cisco, Oracle, Microsoft,
RSA, Google, ISPs and the others have been doing, and will
continue doing, is completely legal and, if insistent, constitutional
(the ur law favoring natsec authorities), so it is misleading to claim
Mark Klein, like Snowden and most other leakers, has been co-opted
by lawyers, civil libertarians and wealthy donors to speak to their scripts.
If not, then to the poor house dogs.
Nothing wrong with being scriptedly misleading, that is what media
and law do to whatever raw remarks are handed, leaked, "Secure
Drop"-boxed to them ("at own risk of sources").
Nor anything misleading about promising strong encryption and
surefire cybersecurity, despite repeated failures, backtracks,
apologias, tweakings, full disclosures, that is what they do "because
the enemy does" and "we're doing the best we can." No, not national
defense grade protection, are you nuts, RTFM.
Nor is it misleading about civil liberty, privacy policy, anonymization,
open source, HTTPS, the current cipher-sec civil-lib kaboodle.
That is necessary for their survival in the marketplace. "That is
what competitors do and become rich at it, we're sick of being
middling strapped."
What might piss off a pristine, completely guiltless humanoid
coder is the brazen duplicity of the opponents of the NSA cartel,
the enjoyment of perks of being on both sides, wearing dual hats,
citizen-official, dissident-loyalist, open-closed, public servant raking
in high fees for duping the public about forever known-to-be-faulty
comsec, reneging on assurances, duo-dancing on pinheads at
comsec fora with mutually celebrated opponents, advising governments,
tesitfying for governments, taking government contracts, betraying
confidences, fork-tongues a flutter.

Well said on skepticism of news reports concerning crypto, comsec,
infosec, natsec. Disinfo and deception are inherent in security and
survival, and best, most reliable, most trusted are typical tools of
misleading exploitation.
Where a single means and method, such as crypto (or science), is
encouraged for rock-solid assurance, at least one other means and
methods should be employed which in no way depends upon the
single means. Hoodwink wins by cheating.
A single means is certain to be continously under attack, and its
vulnerabilities concealed both by the attackers and by the promoters.
Blind faith in a single means is as old as religion, art and royalty, perhaps
as old as humans faced with unending threats from nature and
mortality -- and most of all from each other's thieving and murderous
practices. Duplicity and con-jobs were essential, along with bigger
clubs and rocks, voodoo and faux-virgin sacrifices -- ISIS hardly
different, except more modest and sane and much less wealthy,
than Los Alamos, The Vatican, JP Morgan, Ashley Madison,
Silicon Valley and the IC all fostering blind faith in their own
advertising of rockefeller-st-peter-approved STD protection.
Some HTTPS Everywheres lately have been advertising encryption
and HTTPS as condoms to protect against Internet STD, aka privacy
rape. Peddlers of these hygienics are surely donors to the of Church
of Crypto whose priests do enjoy the pleasures of insider hoo-haa.

Forensics of paper docs, by, say, FBI, examined paper constituents
(ecology of trees, soil, tree-cutters, haulers, pulp mill, paper mill,
coating mill, shipping containers, distributors, sellers, buyers,
lenders), inks and their constituents, human and machine handling
and using and transmitting detritus, attempts to camouflage, divert
and hoax.
Forensics of digital docs do all this and much more from creation
to transceiving, forging, hoaxing, tracking, calling home, so forth.
Coupled with the Internet and commodiously ID'd digital processing
devices from manufacturers of programs and devices to the poor
user blocked from seeing the galore of peeping toms, diverted by
promises of privacy and comsec from, sad to say, promoted by

worse  deception than official secrecy, so blind-justice visionaries
reveal and beckon to get off the grid and underground deep and

Swell initiatives by all the Snowden distributors. Except most
fall prey to PDF manipulation of tagging, implanting, tracking,
by willful intent or by technical ignorance.
It is virtually impossible to sanitize PDFs due to Adobe's inherent
design to meticulously spy on use of its products as well as
deluded user attempts to hide who, when, what, how by users
from creation to modification to wiping to stego to signing to
forging to stinging. Image or accessible-text or other PDF
formats, locked, redacted, watermarked, et al.
Well behind and below the metadata Adobe allows users and
abusers to see, lurks Adobe's advanced persistent meta-meta
to aim for NSA/Tor-multi-level obscurantism by which accessible
meta is used to hide inaccessible. Below dark is darker, ever
darkening as new tools are developed to pry farther into the
less visible and off-oscilloscopic spectrum. DoD issued today
a short directive on the Center for Countermeasures and
Counter-Countermeasures (including cyberweapons like PDFs).
Presume NSA, aided by Adobe, has tracked, will track, Snowden's
material in all its iterations from the time he snatched it to
the latest distributor, consumer and secret archiver in Oahu,
Maryland, Hong Kong, Berlin, Rio, NYC, DC, online and off.
PDFs (and DOCs) are more treacherous than log files, backdoors,
0-days, APTs, what have you due to their popularity. HTM and TXT
are much safer. Courier fonts are safer than other fonts, especially
those promoted by Adobe and others who use fonts to spy (all
rationalized as protection of IP -- ie, comparable to natsec).

An early program of Highlands Group was perception management by
which public opinion would be shaped by disparagement of opposition
to ubiquitous gov-com spying with gambits like "tin-foil hat," "conspiracy
theory," and other forms of reputation attacks. Chorusing these terms
becomes habitual with repetition, even among those who are otherwise
open-minded to novel scientific and theological innovations so long as
the innovations are peer-reviewed or sanctioned by authorities, even
when the authorities are revealed to be self-serving and corrupt, perhaps
especially so. That is the crippling effects of standards setting in all
human endeavors, the favoritism toward standards setting obedient
members and ostacism of dissenters to the dominants.
Fortunately, the tin-hatters and conspiriacists overturn the sclerotic
hegemons if not burned at the stake, imprisoned, die of impoverishment,
driven to suicide. Mercy is never a characteristic of certitude and
maddened crowd-minds compelled to admire miters, crowns, helmets,
wigs of judmentalist soothsayers self-anointed deitific and scientific
absolutist perception managers -- also known as spymasters.

Depends on the converter, whether it keeps the Adobe spying
features witting or unwitting -- which it may be aware of or not.
And whether it has a deal with Adobe to retain disguised.
Adode hidden code is quite devious -- for example it may remain
hidden to use the converted version as a host germ carrier to
propagate itself, following the bio model in our guts to use
feces as fertilizer.
Be careful about using free products, such as Adobe Reader
and free converters of formats of all kinds. They often contain
germs similar to the way NSA and other spies implant germs
in innocuous programs and platforms -- "free" is as devious as
"open" to those who exploit public trust in freedom and openness.
Journalism a prime exploiter under the brand of freedom of the
press to exploit with constitutional protection.
Gmail is one of the most notorious germ transmitters. Tor not quite
as evil, but less because newer than the Internet itself, the Internet
Archive, Wikipedia, social media, PGP, and many more which may
have had noble origins but have been adopted (and bought) by
converters of good to evil -- most readily by government contracts,
vulture capitalism, desparately broke and in debt, entrapment and
coercion by law enforement -- or all of them.
This list is beyond good and evil, thus spoke Zarathrusta, aka
TCM, JG, EH. Though those gods are dead.

Pardon my ignorance about this, and I will do my own research, but do these hidden formattings/stego/call-home functions disappear, get mutilated, become broken when 'converting' such PDF documents to other document types via use of many 'conversion' tools (Calibre comes to mind instantly) or are these embedded organisms a persistent across any automated conversion routine?

The most poignant moment in the book comes when Popper contrasts a conference for the more ideologically minded Bitcoiners at a racetrack on the outskirts of Austin, where Ulbricht grew up, with the gathering of the rich and powerful at the South by Southwest festival, where Ulbrichts mother is politely dismissed as she pleads for funds to help defray her sons legal costs. It was an unhappy reminder of a side of Bitcoin that its new adherents wanted to put behind them, Popper writes. And as he notes, If this was the new world, it didnt seem all that different from the old one ­ at least not yet.
Nor can Digital Gold be a tale with a satisfying ending, because the future of Bitcoin is unknowable right now. As the venture capitalist Barry Silbert says at a Goldman Sachs conference, Bitcoin is either going to change everything, or nothing. But if Bitcoin doesnt change every­thing, people will keep trying to find something that will, and so Poppers book stands as necessary reading, and very intriguing at that, regardless of the eventual fate of his subject.

Excuse delay, thought this went to the cpunks list.
To John-
there are over 200 groups discussing the same issues, at least 2 got
nationalised aggressively, and there have been some tangential posts
on blogs or commercial forums mainly concerns about their datacenter
security not knowing who might attack them, but overall the same
concerns are expressed:
Can the data be spoofed? Not at this resolution without having a model
of everything at the same resolution...
Are the blocks secure? No. [...] But services are stable.
Exports to public? yes, p2p clusters loading, datacenters doing
preparation processing, packed table files are set up for distributed
How do *you* know? UHD/4k VNC video stream to one of the master
control servers handling the database import and text chat with 200
others, no direct access to data here, but certainty that the data is
Involved how? rendering code to make GEO-TIFF map tiles and aggrigated
spline/curves to simplify snapshot data and level of detail pyramid
(multi-variate parametric search) index data.
Now we ask... If this was NATO-ish or any variety of US/UK system
built in the 1960s(?) can we solve for locations or viable downlink
targets to intercept? This hint at geo-magnetic shift is a huge
The coin data is ... glorious... but the other signals are no less
amusing, one set appears to be wired sigint in mhz carrier bands,
assumably urban analogue phone signals as recorded from the switch
routing system's ground or related wiretaps to rf via cable.
genome.gov had links to the various data formats that others
identified in the organics table.
X-Ray physics and detector materials need research, 1890s through
1970s was a huge ammount of X-Ray publicity, but NEVER EVER DID ANYONE
USE IT FOR SIGNALING??? BULLSHIT!
"is there any distinction at military bases or secure areas?" YES.
there is some access control doors which others suggest is a standard
card reader with number pad and automatic door that is common on the
secure layer of military and COMMERCIAL CONTRACTOR facilities that has
a proximity detector signal built into the door frame. THE COIN DATA
WARPS AROUND THIS CYLINDRICAL SIGNAL ON THE DOOR PORTAL AND VECTOR
PASSES THROUGH THE WALL. Obviously the vector is impossible without
fields projected from that security device! There is also a ghosting
signature that reduces sample rate (in the digitiser) around similar
facilities, looks like it was isolated in the newer signal index, so
it should be really obvious who is using these jamming systems and
where! (and where else!)
more questions:
coins on boats? yes.
coins on submarines? YES. (with ghosting)
organic signals? wtf?
Yes, but im told the prior emailed reference is erroneous: the primary
index is a SIGNALS CHARACTERISTIC tree, the supporting block (large
bit scope number) is VERY SIMILAR to a genetic expression profile tree
such as genome.gov/ and many of the gene profiling standards.
Hopefully the news will start posting the technical reports the
primary groups have been preparing last few days... we need to get
physics and advanced crypto groups attention, if the signals are
encoded and that party broke through dense analogue crypto, it will
take a huge effort to solve for that (it may have been an analogue EM
field as well that performed the encoding or reference signals) to
make the same capability posible for others.

if the warlords in both superpowers have their way with arms after the spies
stir up patriotic violence and slink away to drinks and dinner to inviolate
spy nests in embassies where Patriots like Snowden worked for many
years to stir up suspicion and violence, then on to NSA for executing
the CIA hotspot-stirring op, aka civil liberties (secular religion), the
favorite excuse to whip up public dissent and futile debate.
The main way the Lords of War have their way is to heighten national security
pathology through overt and covert intervention of spies, agents, fronts,

"The Dark Net: Inside the Digital Underworld," Jamie Bartlett, examines the
options for escaping observation -- for a while. Cypherpunks is featured for
promoting privacy with technology; crypto, anonymizers, digital currency,
unauthorized disclosures and more.
And how escaping observation very often involves criminal activity, although
as Tim May and others claimed, that is the price paid for cloaking from
prying eyes. That Tor cloaks 415-1230% of child porn sites, 550-7000% of
drug sales, and the like, is allegedly seen by the rebellious undergrounders
as "so what, personal freedom is not free."
So the richest have the greatest personal freedom, "so what," declared
Judge Loretta Preska sentencing shackled hackers for violating the private
enclaves of her kind's lawfully-bending relatives and unjudicials.
Security of any kind is always bleak, not just due to NSA, its the Devil,
why else would religion exist except to forecast the worst imaginable
and preach slim chances of avoiding prying eyes of homicidal deity.
Crypto bent-back prayer leads the day in fashionable cloaks against
inevitable deitific spying -- mostly done by the same devils who espouse
cryptosystems which inevitably fail like perpetual motion machinic faiths
of all kinds.
To the rescue upgrades offer a tad more dreadless illusion while
injecting sand and rust into the sanctuaries, desktops, laptops,
handhelds, clouds, national security, 4-rotored ski lifts to heaven.
Hey, wake up, faithless cypherpunks will not be fooled, remember
this when cold dead hands clamber into windows of Ecuadorian
embassies, run skirted circles at Fort Leavenworth, dream of
languid days key-signig in Hawaii from scrotum-iced pole
dancing in Moscow, incise 365x24 days x 10 years to go

Remember too where the grandfathers of cpunks loll, picking

Excuse delay, thought this went to the cpunks list.
To John-
there are over 200 groups discussing the same issues, at least 2 got
nationalised aggressively, and there have been some tangential posts
on blogs or commercial forums mainly concerns about their datacenter
security not knowing who might attack them, but overall the same
concerns are expressed:
Can the data be spoofed? Not at this resolution without having a model
of everything at the same resolution...
Are the blocks secure? No. [...] But services are stable.
Exports to public? yes, p2p clusters loading, datacenters doing
preparation processing, packed table files are set up for distributed
How do *you* know? UHD/4k VNC video stream to one of the master
control servers handling the database import and text chat with 200
others, no direct access to data here, but certainty that the data is
Involved how? rendering code to make GEO-TIFF map tiles and aggrigated
spline/curves to simplify snapshot data and level of detail pyramid
(multi-variate parametric search) index data.
Now we ask... If this was NATO-ish or any variety of US/UK system
built in the 1960s(?) can we solve for locations or viable downlink
targets to intercept? This hint at geo-magnetic shift is a huge
The coin data is ... glorious... but the other signals are no less
amusing, one set appears to be wired sigint in mhz carrier bands,
assumably urban analogue phone signals as recorded from the switch
routing system's ground or related wiretaps to rf via cable.
genome.gov had links to the various data formats that others
identified in the organics table.
X-Ray physics and detector materials need research, 1890s through
1970s was a huge ammount of X-Ray publicity, but NEVER EVER DID ANYONE
USE IT FOR SIGNALING??? BULLSHIT!
"is there any distinction at military bases or secure areas?" YES.
there is some access control doors which others suggest is a standard
card reader with number pad and automatic door that is common on the
secure layer of military and COMMERCIAL CONTRACTOR facilities that has
a proximity detector signal built into the door frame. THE COIN DATA
WARPS AROUND THIS CYLINDRICAL SIGNAL ON THE DOOR PORTAL AND VECTOR
PASSES THROUGH THE WALL. Obviously the vector is impossible without
fields projected from that security device! There is also a ghosting
signature that reduces sample rate (in the digitiser) around similar
facilities, looks like it was isolated in the newer signal index, so
it should be really obvious who is using these jamming systems and
where! (and where else!)
more questions:
coins on boats? yes.
coins on submarines? YES. (with ghosting)
organic signals? wtf?
Yes, but im told the prior emailed reference is erroneous: the primary
index is a SIGNALS CHARACTERISTIC tree, the supporting block (large
bit scope number) is VERY SIMILAR to a genetic expression profile tree
such as genome.gov/ and many of the gene profiling standards.
Hopefully the news will start posting the technical reports the
primary groups have been preparing last few days... we need to get
physics and advanced crypto groups attention, if the signals are
encoded and that party broke through dense analogue crypto, it will
take a huge effort to solve for that (it may have been an analogue EM
field as well that performed the encoding or reference signals) to
make the same capability posible for others.
Staying alive!

No way yet to tell what really happened in these "massive breaches."
Accounts vary from initial reports, to later reports, to investigations,
to hearings, interlaced with remediations of various alleged iterations,
leading in most cases to claim the full story cannot be revealed due
to possible harm by disclosure. And best, the favorite runaround:
the usual suspects are named without evidence, indeed, assessments
are shaded with the customary claims by the usual experts consulted,
"it is  hard to tell who did it" and not only that evasion but the best and
brightest security wizards (there are six of them named, 2 for, 2 against

@_subject: Governments Covertly Fund Internet Freedom Activists 
Well said. Very few citizens receiving government funds, benefits,
perks, favors, bribes, contracts, tax write-offs, and even fewer NGO
beneficiaries are bothered by laws. procedures, pacts, secrecy,
venality, venerable greasing of palms. This is what governments
and NGOs were invented for and remain the premier source of
livelihood one way or the other, especially for those who pretend
opposition while royally partying with opponents. Royally, not
6- and 7-figure dollar compensation of officers of NGO, edu, com,
gov, religion, media ad nauseum, confirm the arrangement to promise
public service as a lure to vampire the lucre of believers who think they
will be able to become brazen vampires too. And it works, shrewd
recruits and donors like Soros, Omidyar, WikiLeaks, Snowden and
millions of followers flood into civil liberties, cybersec, anonymizing,
FOI, spying, think tanks, ACLU, EFF, EPIC, Privacy International,
Investigative Journalists, ProPublica, The Intercept, on and on ad
nauseum from Day One to 0-Day.
Favorite rejoiner to accusations of perfidy is to accuse of conspiracy
of various stripes, never ever confessing that the greatest conspiracies
are promulgated by governments and their well-trained domesticates:
Spies, agents, sources, cohorts, informants, educators, preachers,
contractors, opinionators, operators, heroes, medalists, oh hell, us
SOB maestroes of the Duh Conspiracy.

Anselm or another really smart Arab philosopher argued that
God is the only atheist and can be the only one. Well, these
thinkers invented the concept of zero, which subsumes, whatever,
that fancy word means, fits the notion of singular atheist.
Along came Sartre and a gang of existentialist bozos who
got aroused by the notion of nothingness. So happens most
of them were atheists except in foxholes, then Mommy was
what they cried.
There you have it, God is a single Mom, pissed at having no
deadbeat shitheads to whang with a skillet for inseminating
little whiney turds inside Her Vatican, most sporting red skullcaps
like penile protubers, pretending celibacy, that is, Grateful Deadhead
Daddies ravaging the mommies of spoiled crybaby atheists who
want to be their own daddies shacked up inside the panties of
Big Bad Mom.
Sartre, a mommy's boy pure existencely, called this the desire
to be god, this spoiled brat atheism, this less than zero wankism,
this lust to be St Peter, sorry for the penility, this Me, Me, Me,
sucking on Mommy's mammary, yearning to assassinate
Daddies for taking all mom's milk themselves.

technical savagery, genocide by strategic bombing of civilians (Saudi
Arabia relishing that in Yemen), exculpation of policy setters and enforcers
and salve those who die, are savaged and family-death-benefited serving
nations of holiers than thou. The current US giant pie of all-religions
demon-fighters memoralized on patriotic headstones and dog-tags:
If your cybersecurity faith is not listed, engage a faith-based lobbyist
like EFF, ACLU, The Intercept, WikiLeaks.
Not hard to believe all wars are narrow-minded religious wars, the
more pea-brained, vicious and deadly the greater the faith in terrifying
people into submission or by Your God or Godless teaching the
resisters and atheists to RTFM and believe it.
Manual burners, body immolators, head loppers, come on, those

@_subject: noscript is 10 years! 
NYT today has book review on gradual replacement of humans
by robots, a beloved investment of those at the top, so John Deere
is out to replace farmers not make them more productive. Same
for robotics in general; their inventors, coders, engineers, will
themselves be replaced by robots which can outperform their
vulnerable, increasingly marginalized parents.
We have seen how digital spying is fast replacing humans who
are hired to algo, build and unleash the robots, guide them for a
while until they learn to be self-guided and self-improved across
the flesh-and-blood spectrum, bottom to top, yes, even the top
are robotically destined to be invaded by algorithms way smarter
than their makers. Yes, robotic subversion has happened to banks,
governments, investors, spy agencies, their contractors and
Maybe not yet time for humans to eat their kids, their homegrown
garden and feed lot, but that's the model beloved by those
at the top, yes, that is what they are doing, eating their seed
corn. Go for it, John Deere, eat your sales and repair crew.
Oh well, the richest got richer last year, the prisons got
fuller, buildings got taller and deadlier, drones are becoming
favorites of agri-farmers, kid predators, and revenge porners.

@_subject: Karl Rove's confusion about capacity of NSA's Utah data center. 
Disks or any electro-mechanical device, may not be the only, or
principle, means of storage. So capacity may not be the measure
of capability.
The need for speed of access to and processing of data requires
the data to be in active memory all the time. Arrayed, large CPU-like
"chips" or solid state (best is unsolid state) processors make data
constantly usable, always up to date, no lag time, no wear and tear.
Physical disks use too much energy and require too much architecture
to rack, interconnect, house, energize, maintain, repair, replace, update.
And are way too slow and clunky.
However, this doesn't mean Utah Data Center is not useful as a
Potemkin deception. Or that much of it is Potemkin deception.
Why else make it so observable during funding, design, construction
and afterwards a juicy easily photographed, concentrated target of
sneaky weaponry of hardware, software, sneakerware, hey come
attack us ware.
Somewhere, in Utah, or the planet, there are data handlers about
which little is publicly known except as miniaturized examples on
personal playthings. Meanwhile we are fed out of date fantasies of
capability based on xxx-bytes of increasingly absurd prefixes which
are like innumerable angels on pinheads.
One way to spot what's what is to look at the generators of facilities.
And their fuel tanks. Fully active data require a lot of uninterruptable
juice. We traced the power lines for UDC and found they lead far
astray, also Potemkin. Could be the generators and fuel tanks are
This is not to suggest Snowden pushing crypto and dribbling docs
are Potemkin. Could be, though, so slow and clunky, so observable,
and publishable for those willing to suspend disbelief.

Now you're talking vulture capital capabilities, if you can answer these questions
millions of dollars and users await your products, thanks to Edward Snowden.
Consider asking the coach, pastor, BFF, mentor, online advisor (no offense
Gadit but you fit the predator profile) to take you home to use his/hers/trans
computer which will have the  latest cloaking tools, including those which
block, divert, trash, evade, deep six, anon-legionize, the most devilish meddlers
promoting villainous affairs to advance their villainous careers, aka kiddie porn
watchdogs tutored by natsec spooks. Prepare to be stripped naked in the sauna,
like Jake Appelbaum, like beloved overseers of all stripes, phones into the
lead-lined chest, to guard against you being a babe to entrap the beloved
wizened overseer (sorry Bart, no offense but you fit Jake's profile).
Cpunk archivist popped up when this topic tripped its sensor to say hear ye,
this is the 4,096th time the helpless kid bait has been set here. Undercover
careers begin with tapping into online fora to test homebrewed mousetraps,
the most common being a kid with troubled parents, next most Tempest signals
being emanated by latest, most compulsive child bewitched by the awesome
freedom of personal devices, next ex-spies with unbelievable stuff to shatter
the empire of those who know shit shoveling into into those whose diet is
limited to shinola.
If you advise the kid to stay away from personal devices connected to the
rest of the world, that will get you a visit from connection authorities accusing
you of treason. Show your credentials by yelling accessible encryption.

@_subject: Karl Rove's confusion about capacity of NSA's Utah data center. 
Disks or any electro-mechanical device, may not be the only, or
principle, means of storage. So capacity may not be the measure
of capability.
The need for speed of access to and processing of data requires
the data to be in active memory all the time. Arrayed, large CPU-like
"chips" or solid state (best is unsolid state) processors make data
constantly usable, always up to date, no lag time, no wear and tear.
Physical disks use too much energy and require too much architecture
to rack, interconnect, house, energize, maintain, repair, replace, update.
And are way too slow and clunky.
However, this doesn't mean Utah Data Center is not useful as a
Potemkin deception. Or that much of it is Potemkin deception.
Why else make it so observable during funding, design, construction
and afterwards a juicy easily photographed, concentrated target of
sneaky weaponry of hardware, software, sneakerware, hey come
attack us ware.
Somewhere, in Utah, or the planet, there are data handlers about
which little is publicly known except as miniaturized examples on
personal playthings. Meanwhile we are fed out of date fantasies of
capability based on xxx-bytes of increasingly absurd prefixes which
are like innumerable angels on pinheads.
One way to spot what's what is to look at the generators of facilities.
And their fuel tanks. Fully active data require a lot of uninterruptable
juice. We traced the power lines for UDC and found they lead far
astray, also Potemkin. Could be the generators and fuel tanks are
This is not to suggest Snowden pushing crypto and dribbling docs
are Potemkin. Could be, though, so slow and clunky, so observable,
and publishable for those willing to suspend disbelief.

Snowden is to be pitied for believing giving material to the press to do with
what it likes is a victory.
Giving all material to the press for its mediation, interpretation and
monetization, as well as consulting with representatives of government
on what to publish, hardly changes the status quo of representative, rather
than direct democracy.
Snowden and the press are complicit in withholding the alleged material
he took, even now the public does not know and may never know what
that material consists of. The soup has been contaminated by editorial
selection, redaction and interpretation. That may be inevitable with the
sordid process the press calls leaking ("wikileaks" compounds the falsity
of censorious and editorially regulated pubic participation -- wiki -- and
exploitive, biased, corrupt, dramatized disclosure -- leaks).
Withholding material by self-empowered representatives, whether Snowden
or the press, self-regulating lawyers, stock peddlers and other professionals,
is a variation on official secrecy by which secret keepers pad their income
and perks so long as they abide the cult of secrecy. All this has been
done in the Snowden affair, as well as Ellsberg's. Those who don't
abid the cult go to jail, or ruined financially, or stigmatized for life.
Even now the representatives of the government, NGOs ACLU, EFF, MSM
and Freedom of the Press are negotiating a deal for Snowden for his return
to the US, following the Ellsberg precedent. The USG appears to be willing
to make a deal with all sides claiming victory "for the people." When such
deals are primarily beneficial to the secretkeepers and interpreters and
judges of what the public is allowed to know while "protecting national
Finally, cpunks was founded, and may still, to advocate and demonstrate

Tim May called his version Cryptoanarchy, Jim Bell called his Assassination
Politics, others called theirs financial, black net, anonymization, wikileaks,
and a slew of variations (see Wikipedia for those). Fortunately quite few
avoided naming and publicizing their alternatives to minimize being tagged
as traitors and worse -- those remain quietly virulent, albeit some were
snatched by governments to be insiders and informants.
Insiders and informants have always been welcomed on this list. This to
avoid the venal corruption of secrecy, asymmetrical exploitation of leaders
over followers, and the crippling narcotic of believing public interest is the
same as privileged party interest, and worse, that the concomitant rewards
of being somebody publicized is superior to being out of sight working
hard to undermine archies of all stripes -- oligarchy of the Omidyar type
currently underwriting the Snowden sweettalking of NGO field bosses
overseeing booty distribution handsomely paid by tax write-offs.
As Snowden tweets, he's a director at Freedom of the Press. That is,
still among the privileged insiders of loyal opposition. As here.

HTTPS has become a fetish, maybe always was. It serves as an end point fig leaf,
simulates privacy and infosec, but does not protect visitors from the full stream of
access to their traffic end to end. Same for shallow, exculpatory privacy policy
always "taken very seriously" laughingly. So encryption and anonymization provide
decorous couture of genitals while leaving the rest bare assed.
Web sites are insecure by the very design of the Internet which allows operators
and administrators full access to traffic "so it can be maintained properly." That
is policed and spied behind misleading signs of safety like HTTPS and privacy
policy. Every web site operator knows this and keeps it quiet to avoid scaring
away visitors. So they adopt the latest fig leafs and earnestly promote them
as essential while hacking and spying predators continue to ravage the Internet
as if the planet was created for the benefit of warmakers and their engineers

Cryptome's offer to sell itself and logs for the amount Omidyar
is tax writing off  at The Intercept, and skying the donation for its archive
to the weekly stipend of top Snowden exploiters, is a parody of
what highly-profitable web sites like e-Bay, ISPs, equipment, program
and cybersecurity peddlers, and net operators and overseers are doing.
Access, traffic and transaction logs are ginned, sorted, stored, munged,
manipulated, sold, stolen, and more, all along the many packeting, hops,
boosts, diversions, conversions, hand-offs to various devices of the route
from user to destination. End point of user and the destination is merely
one bit of data, well, two bits, with gobs of bits quietly being gobbled
elsewhere, camouflaged by the delusion of privacy policies, anonymization,
and website log deletion or never ginning logs.
Cryptome has no logs, never has. Its various ISPs have copious logs of
many kinds (not just the simplistic access logs meant to delude website
operators), along with all the other transceivers of visitor activities and
transaction metadata and metametadata.
Cryptome has never run a server, just buy the service. We do track our
ISPs' activities and through them the ganglia of the Internet to see what
happens to our files.
Voracious bots have always been the heaviest users of Cryptome, siphoning
files hourly, daily, monthly, then providing them to users at other locations
to gin their own families of data for sale to govs, coms, edus, banks,
investigators, investors.
Google, Bing, Internet Archive, Torrent, drops, govs, spies, academics,
researchers, cyberseckers, take, steal actually (as do we), Internet files
for their own use which is primarily to gather data on users, the precious
jewels of the Internet which underwrite its so-called free service.
Public benefit aggregators like Internet Archive, Wikipedia, Google
docs, universities, NGOs, are the prime abusers of visitor data, both
to their websites and by special privilege of advising visitors on how
to protect their privacy while being pickpocketed of personal data.
Cybersecurity con artists are as bad by deluding their visitors and
customers about how to protect themselves with encryption, Tor,
anonymization, OTR, secret chats, deep web, blah, blah. All these
con artists gin their own logs of trusting-users data, then either
hand it over to authorities, sell it covertly, share with cohorts
and standards orgs, write papers and give speeches soliciting
customers, testify in Congress and courts, inform grand juries,
cut plea bargains, brag about resisting NSLs, set up warrant
canaries, share tips with donors and investors, yadda, yadda,
do donate generously, but best, generate taxable income,
tax write-offs, never-ending war, paranoia and FUD.
Cryptome has no privacy or security policy to deceive visitors, and
periodically announce that, and warn not to trust us or any other
website, especially those which advocate HTTPS, anonymization,
privacy, security and crow about civil liberties and public benefit.

@_subject: Snowden on the Twitters 
Snowden is to be pitied for believing giving material to the press to do with
what it likes is a victory.
Giving all material to the press for its mediation, interpretation and
monetization, as well as consulting with representatives of government
on what to publish, hardly changes the status quo of representative, rather
than direct democracy.
Snowden and the press are complicit in withholding the alleged material
he took, even now the public does not know and may never know what
that material consists of. The soup has been contaminated by editorial
selection, redaction and interpretation. That may be inevitable with the
sordid process the press calls leaking ("wikileaks" compounds the falsity
of censorious and editorially regulated pubic participation -- wiki -- and
exploitive, biased, corrupt, dramatized disclosure -- leaks).
Withholding material by self-empowered representatives, whether Snowden
or the press, self-regulating lawyers, stock peddlers and other professionals,
is a variation on official secrecy by which secret keepers pad their income
and perks so long as they abide the cult of secrecy. All this has been
done in the Snowden affair, as well as Ellsberg's. Those who don't
abid the cult go to jail, or ruined financially, or stigmatized for life.
Even now the representatives of the government, NGOs ACLU, EFF, MSM
and Freedom of the Press are negotiating a deal for Snowden for his return
to the US, following the Ellsberg precedent. The USG appears to be willing
to make a deal with all sides claiming victory "for the people." When such
deals are primarily beneficial to the secretkeepers and interpreters and
judges of what the public is allowed to know while "protecting national

as traitors and worse -- those remain quietly virulent, albeit some were

Insiders and informants have always been welcomed on this list. This to
avoid the venal corruption of secrecy, asymmetrical exploitation of leaders
over followers, and the crippling narcotic of believing public interest is the
same as privileged party interest, and worse, that the concomitant rewards
of being somebody publicized is superior to being out of sight working
hard to undermine archies of all stripes -- oligarchy of the Omidyar type
currently underwriting the Snowden sweettalking of NGO field bosses
overseeing booty distribution handsomely paid by tax write-offs.
As Snowden tweets, he's a director at Freedom of the Press. That is,

HTTPS has become a fetish, maybe always was. It serves as an end point fig leaf,
simulates privacy and infosec, but does not protect visitors from the full stream of
access to their traffic end to end. Same for shallow, exculpatory privacy policy
always "taken very seriously" laughingly. So encryption and anonymization provide
decorous couture of genitals while leaving the rest bare assed.
Web sites are insecure by the very design of the Internet which allows operators
and administrators full access to traffic "so it can be maintained properly." That
is policed and spied behind misleading signs of safety like HTTPS and privacy
policy. Every web site operator knows this and keeps it quiet to avoid scaring
away visitors. So they adopt the latest fig leafs and earnestly promote them
as essential while hacking and spying predators continue to ravage the Internet

@_subject: Snowden on the Twitters 
Snowden is to be pitied for believing giving material to the press to do with
what it likes is a victory.
Giving all material to the press for its mediation, interpretation and
monetization, as well as consulting with representatives of government
on what to publish, hardly changes the status quo of representative, rather
than direct democracy.
Snowden and the press are complicit in withholding the alleged material
he took, even now the public does not know and may never know what
that material consists of. The soup has been contaminated by editorial
selection, redaction and interpretation. That may be inevitable with the
sordid process the press calls leaking ("wikileaks" compounds the falsity
of censorious and editorially regulated pubic participation -- wiki -- and
exploitive, biased, corrupt, dramatized disclosure -- leaks).
Withholding material by self-empowered representatives, whether Snowden
or the press, self-regulating lawyers, stock peddlers and other professionals,
is a variation on official secrecy by which secret keepers pad their income
and perks so long as they abide the cult of secrecy. All this has been
done in the Snowden affair, as well as Ellsberg's. Those who don't
abid the cult go to jail, or ruined financially, or stigmatized for life.
Even now the representatives of the government, NGOs ACLU, EFF, MSM
and Freedom of the Press are negotiating a deal for Snowden for his return
to the US, following the Ellsberg precedent. The USG appears to be willing
to make a deal with all sides claiming victory "for the people." When such
deals are primarily beneficial to the secretkeepers and interpreters and
judges of what the public is allowed to know while "protecting national

avoid the venal corruption of secrecy, asymmetrical exploitation of leaders
over followers, and the crippling narcotic of believing public interest is the
same as privileged party interest, and worse, that the concomitant rewards
of being somebody publicized is superior to being out of sight working
hard to undermine archies of all stripes -- oligarchy of the Omidyar type
currently underwriting the Snowden sweettalking of NGO field bosses
overseeing booty distribution handsomely paid by tax write-offs.

HTTPS has become a fetish, maybe always was. It serves as an end point fig leaf,
simulates privacy and infosec, but does not protect visitors from the full stream of
access to their traffic end to end. Same for shallow, exculpatory privacy policy
always "taken very seriously" laughingly. So encryption and anonymization provide
decorous couture of genitals while leaving the rest bare assed.
Web sites are insecure by the very design of the Internet which allows operators
and administrators full access to traffic "so it can be maintained properly." That
is policed and spied behind misleading signs of safety like HTTPS and privacy
policy. Every web site operator knows this and keeps it quiet to avoid scaring
away visitors. So they adopt the latest fig leafs and earnestly promote them
as essential while hacking and spying predators continue to ravage the Internet
as if the planet was created for the benefit of warmakers and their engineers

mirror the Cryptome archives, did do further research and announce it widely
and has picked a fight with several parties, complained of mistreatment,
censorship, abuse, exposed collateral innocent (ha!) parties.
We also told Best log files are the dirtiest secret of the Internet, none are
secure, none private, none singular, admins and websites lie about using
them, exploiting them, deleting them, needing them, stealing them, accusing
about them, inflating them, rigging them. They pay for the Net, thus not ever
going away or kept secure.
So Best is going in the tried and true direction, many others have staggered.
And if determined he will avoid depending on anybody for support. More power

National security religion current world malware leader. Consecrated

mules unable to offspring so bray at one another neuteredly, some
tote-packing jackasses for secretkeepers, some little horses in a
geek carnival DEFCON, one a jester performing for food, bed

pussies on a hilltop armed to the gizzard against PETA warriors,
several offshore heroined and drunk in hot tubs of rotgut financial

themselves in courtrooms pursuing phantasms of conquering
an NSA long out of date by new improved GQNSAFSB, half a
dozen are dead, dying, diseased or headphoned heads mounted
on mathematics college entablatures. One is a high official
in DoD cybercommand-panic to the max, a twin doing the
same for PRC. A small number of geezers continue to write
code, that is hire kids to do that, but mostly consult to crypto
cretinous corporations, suckle on NGO-tit extortions, deliver
commodious farts on the speaker circuit, the best and brightest
take long naps, buy weekly, monthly, yearly lap dances, search
Google for their names, spit and shit blood, shed hair and flesh,
burst into episodes of cackling obscure hashes in elliptic

broken teeth and code pukes down shirt fronts, dapper

Right. A few days ago we slipped under the lasers, slithered past motion detectors,
aimed a night scope at the silhouette trying to calm a gaggle of squabbling cats,
quickly snapped a dozen of infrareds, setting off bam, bam, bam, instantly felt
the shadows fireball around us, singeing our asbestos foiled tents, stun grenades
blasting our shallows, swarm of drones peppering us with dum-dums, teams of
robots roaring and thrumming and spewing greenish skin-eating droplets and
lung ravaging vapors, thankfully we were ready for all that, except one little
oversight: a great chasm split the desert, a mushroom rose into the air, there
was begoggled Ninja'd Tim hanging upside down like a giant dope-wizened bat
from a black balloon, well, that's the last thing we saw before awakening atop

For Mr. Heimbach is far from alone in his esteem for Mr. Putin. Throughout the collection of white ethnocentrists, nationalists, populists and neo-Nazis that has taken root on both sides of the Atlantic, Mr. Putin is widely revered as a kind of white knight: a symbol of strength, racial purity and traditional Christian values in a world under threat from Islam, immigrants and rootless cosmopolitan elites.
"I've always seen Russia as the guardian at the gate, as the easternmost outpost of our people," said Sam Dickson, a white supremacist and former Ku Klux Klan lawyer who frequently speaks at gatherings of the so-called alt-right, a far-right fringe movement that embraces white nationalism and a range of racist and anti-immigrant positions. "They are our barrier to the Oriental invasion of our homeland and the great protector of Christendom. I admire the Russian people. They are the strongest white people on earth."
His voice amplified by Russian-funded think tanks, the Orthodox Church and state-controlled news media, like RT and Sputnik, that are aimed at foreign audiences, Mr. Putin has in recent years reached out to conservative and nationalist groups abroad with the message that he stands with them against gay rights activists and other forces of moral decay.
He first embraced this theme when, campaigning for his third term as president in early 2012, he presented Russia not only as a military power deserving of international respect, but also as a "civilizational model" that could rally all those in Russia and beyond who were fed up with the erosion of traditional values.
The Kremlin has also provided financial and logistical support to far-right forces in the West, said Peter Kreko, an analyst at Political Capital, a research group in Budapest. Though Jobbik, a neo-Nazi party in Hungary and other groups have been accused of receiving money from Moscow, the only proven case so far involves the National Front in France, which got loans worth more than $11 million from Russian banks.
Russia also shares with far-right groups across the world a deeply held belief that, regardless of their party, traditional elites should be deposed because of their support for globalism and transnational institutions like NATO and the European Union.

@_subject: I Am a Dangerous Professor 
Those familiar with George Orwell's "1984" will recall that "Newspeak was designed not to extend but to diminish the range of thought." I recently felt the weight of this Orwellian ethos when many of my students sent emails to inform me, and perhaps warn me, that my name appears on the Professor Watchlist, a new website created by a conservative youth group known as Turning Point USA.
I could sense the gravity in those email messages, a sense of relaying what is to come. The Professor Watchlist's mission, among other things, is to sound an alarm about those of us within academia who "advance leftist propaganda in the classroom." It names and includes photographs of some 200 professors.
The Watchlist appears to be consistent with a nostalgic desire "to make America great again" and to expose and oppose those voices in academia that are anti-Republican or express anti-Republican values. For many black people, making America "great again" is especially threatening, as it signals a return to a more explicit and unapologetic racial dystopia. For us, dreaming of yesterday is not a privilege, not a desire, but a nightmare.
The new "watchlist" is essentially a new species of McCarthyism, especially in terms of its overtones of "disloyalty" to the American republic. And it is reminiscent of Cointelpro, the secret F.B.I. program that spied on, infiltrated and discredited American political organizations in the '50s and '60s. Its goal of "outing" professors for their views helps to create the appearance of something secretly subversive. It is a form of exposure designed to mark, shame and silence.
So, in my classrooms, I refuse to remain silent in the face of racism, its subtle and systemic structure. I refuse to remain silent in the face of patriarchal and sexist hegemony and the denigration of women's bodies, or about the ways in which women have internalized male assumptions of how they should look and what they should feel and desire.
I refuse to be silent about forms of militarism in which innocent civilians are murdered in the name of "democracy." I refuse to remain silent when it comes to acknowledging the existential and psychic dread and chaos experienced by those who are targets of xenophobia and homophobia.
I refuse to remain silent when it comes to transgender women and men who are beaten to death by those who refuse to create conditions of I refuse to remain silent in a world where children become targets of sexual violence, and where unarmed black bodies are shot dead by the state and its proxies, where those with disabilities are mocked and still rendered "monstrous," and where the earth suffers because some of us refuse to hear its suffering, where my ideas are marked as "un-American," and apparently Well, if it is dangerous to teach my students to love their neighbors, to think and rethink constructively and ethically about who their neighbors are, and how they have been taught to see themselves as disconnected and neoliberal subjects, then, yes, I am dangerous, and what I teach is dangerous.

Snowden did the right thing, as he said, released the whole wad
to the public. Just released it to the wrong few people with no
technical capabilities but with desire for personal recognition
and profit-taking. Heading to Hong Kong "Greenwald and Poitras
danced in the aircraft's aisle upon reading sample documents,"
according to one account by Luke Harding (Greenwald denied this).
Both full release and profit-taking could have been done, and maybe
both were done, that is, the full release has been placed where more
technically capable persons have access. A few technical persons
have had limited access according to news reports, to advise the
cache withholders, but not many which is highly regrettable.
As we said in the interview there are a host of parties with greater
skills and experience publishing classified documents, National
Security Archive and Federation of American Scientists, among
them. Granted that these orgs are quite cautious about publishing
unauthorized disclosures due to their boards having close ties
to authorities and dutiful legal obedience.
No question the methodology employed by favored journalists
has been effective for engaging (entertaining) the public. The
comsec and credibility problem is that the small number of
documents released (~11%) and large number of narratives
(>100/1 of document pages) has skewed and dramatized the
disclosures such that it is impossible to know how accurate
the fragments are without access to the full wad.
Now there are rumors that the bulk of the documents may be
returned for Snowden's exculpation, which would be a great
loss for the public but swell for Snowden and his PR team.
Short shrifting the public by the media where leaks are concerned
has become, maybe always was, the norm. Direct to the public
disclosure, un-mediated, is what is needed, no secretmaking
privilege to anyone. Journalists bristle at this, claim the public
must be told what to think, and in this journalists are just like
Moreover, that Snowden allegedly requires the cache holders to
check with USG before release is pernicious, maybe false. Quite

cryptome cypherpunks
It's good to see The Intercept and others smell a rat with the fake fight between
Apple and the USG (hardly only the FBI). Crediting Snowden and his flacks
with this phony crypto war is a bit much, though, opposition to government
instrusions around the world have been persistent for decades, especially
against the ever increasing digital violations and forever failing protections
against them. "Strong crypto is hard to do while making it easy for users."
What is most needed from the Snowden 90% still-secret wad are defenses
against the USG now that alarms have been repeatedly clanged about redacted
and incomplete offenses. Most peculiar that almost no defensive measures
have been released, although Snowden may have insisted on not releasing
those as threats to US national security.
Snowden's alleged demand that outlets check with USG before releases
to assure no national harm is institutionalized in national security
reporting, but is also required by fear of prosecution of outlets and
their investors such as Omidyar, Slim, Bezo, all the major media.
Withholding the 90% of Snowden material which he claims was given
to the public, is damnable betrayal of the public for monetary and
professional benefits. In this way the Snowden material has been
handled like the USG handles it, as if it is owned by the handlers,
not by the ones who paid for it.
It would not be off-base to accuse the Snowden handlers of what
Apple and the USG are doing, engaging in a fake fight "in the public
interest" for pecuniary gain. Privacy and civil liberties are being
peddled as commercial products, cheered yesterday by Apple

It's good to see The Intercept and others smell a rat with the fake fight between
Apple and the USG (hardly only the FBI). Crediting Snowden and his flacks
with this phony crypto war is a bit much, though, opposition to government
instrusions around the world have been persistent for decades, especially
against the ever increasing digital violations and forever failing protections
against them. "Strong crypto is hard to do while making it easy for users."
What is most needed from the Snowden 90% still-secret wad are defenses
against the USG now that alarms have been repeatedly clanged about redacted
and incomplete offenses. Most peculiar that almost no defensive measures
have been released, although Snowden may have insisted on not releasing
those as threats to US national security.
Snowden's alleged demand that outlets check with USG before releases
to assure no national harm is institutionalized in national security
reporting, but is also required by fear of prosecution of outlets and
their investors such as Omidyar, Slim, Bezo, all the major media.
Withholding the 90% of Snowden material which he claims was given
to the public, is damnable betrayal of the public for monetary and
professional benefits. In this way the Snowden material has been
handled like the USG handles it, as if it is owned by the handlers,
not by the ones who paid for it.
It would not be off-base to accuse the Snowden handlers of what
Apple and the USG are doing, engaging in a fake fight "in the public
interest" for pecuniary gain. Privacy and civil liberties are being
peddled as commercial products, cheered yesterday by Apple

Coms eagerly post-Snowden promising crypto does not mean they
have stopped helping gov-com secret spying by other means, au contraire.
Crypto protects only a few of many means gov-coms have to spy on public,
so should not divert from those, nor from 88% Snowden docs withheld.
Govs may concede crypto public protection to assure other means remain
effective. Promoting public crypto as a cloak appears to be the campaign
underway, now as in the 1990s, so beguiling to crypto advocates to claim
a win (for the industry-org-edu to continue doing openly and secretly what
it does best).

Snowden did the right thing, as he said, released the whole wad
to the public. Just released it to the wrong few people with no
technical capabilities but with desire for personal recognition
and profit-taking. Heading to Hong Kong "Greenwald and Poitras
danced in the aircraft's aisle upon reading sample documents,"
according to one account by Luke Harding (Greenwald denied this).
Both full release and profit-taking could have been done, and maybe
both were done, that is, the full release has been placed where more
technically capable persons have access. A few technical persons
have had limited access according to news reports, to advise the
cache withholders, but not many which is highly regrettable.
As we said in the interview there are a host of parties with greater
skills and experience publishing classified documents, National
Security Archive and Federation of American Scientists, among
them. Granted that these orgs are quite cautious about publishing
unauthorized disclosures due to their boards having close ties
to authorities and dutiful legal obedience.
No question the methodology employed by favored journalists
has been effective for engaging (entertaining) the public. The
comsec and credibility problem is that the small number of
documents released (~11%) and large number of narratives
(>100/1 of document pages) has skewed and dramatized the
disclosures such that it is impossible to know how accurate
the fragments are without access to the full wad.
Now there are rumors that the bulk of the documents may be
returned for Snowden's exculpation, which would be a great
loss for the public but swell for Snowden and his PR team.
Short shrifting the public by the media where leaks are concerned

There are indeed similarities of the crypto advocacy crowd with
advocates of guns, which figures because both are classified
as munitions and serve similar purposes.
Gun control could be linked to crypto control, and some cpunks,
in early days at least, emphasized the parallel. "My cold dead hands"
was invoked for gun self-protection and passphrase for privacy
Other parallels can be seen between cryptographers and weapons
manufacturers pursuing commercial, governmental and user
markets with sales pitches tuned to each category. Dual use
an essential feature, duplicity and dual hats too.
Could be more coming in regulation of cryptographers like gun
manufacturers and dealers. And best, the black market and
underground and warfare tools merchants and of course
informants and betrayers.
Licensed crypto is already at hand througn chips, devices,
algos, OSes and not a few deceptive insertions and implants
emplaced while argument about the crypto war diverts attention.
More crypto cops, overt and covert, sure, why not, that has been
around for a while, almost surely from the beginning of crypto
not to say cpunks and the cryptography lists.

Indeed, some cpunks advocate both arms and crypto personal offense
and defense, but many more set up crypto initiatives (promotional and
inventive) to distance themselves from those they considered harming
the public image of Encryption (Cryptoo to vulgar",  especially those who
marketed academic, commercial and above all governmental comsec

natsec-cum-privacy oriented NGOs, press and press-agents eager to

mail.com>
"New York can and should lead the nation in protecting its citizens, and
in responding to the misguided and dangerous attempts by digital device
manufacturers to turn digital devices into virtual safes that, being
beyond the reach of law enforcement, are havens for criminals.  Revela-
tions in the recent past about NSA surveillance and similar government
intrusions on privacy have made people acutely aware of threats to their
privacy. The goal of this bill is not to limit peoples' privacy.
Peoples' privacy is protected by the warrant requirement, as it always
has been. This bill would help to protect all New Yorkers."

If crypto follows the gun model, there will be a lucrative business
bringing crypto-phones into New York. That will follow the US
crypto marketers flooding the globe through immensely flexible
export controls favoring the most criminal leaders kept in
power with US armaments.
In the end, New York is so deeply corrupted, legally and
illegally as Europe Asia Africa Anartica, the crypto controls
will be as great a business as controls on money, taxes,
sex, medicine, religion, education, sports, natsec, above
all, justice.

@_subject: Facebook Messenger adds end-to-end encryption. 
End-to-end encryption is reliable only if it begins and ends without
use of computers and networked transceivers and devices, operating
systems and systems administration, electromagnetism and
algorithms, ISPs and packets.
Each of these are vulnerabilities, not unlike Tor, anonymization,
VPN, OTR, any method widely promoted and recommended.
The more widely known and adopted the less like to be secure.
So Facebook fails the same way Crypto-AG failed, and those
developed in between.
Cybersecurity is on a roll, given extra boost by Snowden releases
(limited as they are by his "do no harm to the USA") and his
continuing boosterism from protection of the other world
policeman out to make sure no encryption is invulnerable.
Currently all states are promoting limited cybersecurity in various
see-through couture but never disclosing what the states use
for hiding most-secret comsec. Snowden, among many in
the ballooning cybersec field, never advocates full disclosure,
and in that ancient way, protect their state-sanctioned privileges,
in RU as in 5-Eyes.
Facebook is regulated by the USG and through it other nations
so not likely to place its survival above that of customers. But it
certainly uses the language of customer protection pretty much
identical to all the 74 amici which jumped on board Apple's
grandstanding fight against USG, settled secretly.
Official secrecy continues to be the primary vulnerability of
cybersecurity and public comsec. No nation can survive
without it, nor can any state-regulated entity.
Without top secret code word privilege nobody is secure.
And those with that privilege willingly harm the populace
by lying and cheating and disinforming. Snowden fits that,
probably entrapped to do so by his media handlers who
dare not challenge the states which privilege media.

That pernicious arc is exhibited in crypto advocacy and   high-domed dissident mail lists like cpunks, nettime, EFF, ACLU, WikiLeaks and PK-ilk 1976-present. Not a few fellow-travelers have switched sides from opposition to opposition to opposition, maybe never were dissidential, maybe never intended to defy the irresistably rewarding toxicities of Jobs, Thiel, Trump, Soros, Omidyar, Bezos, Slim, Putin, princes of WS-oligarch royalty. Prince Castro not in that cosseting loop, yo granmamma.

Understanding distinction between privacy and secrecy is essential,

privacy, and true privacy totally hostile to secrecy. Privacy policies are
fraudulent because they allow secretkeepers to violate privacy with
"lawful" impunity. Which is why Snowden, Tor, media, corporations,
NGOs, security experts, dual hatters, lawyers, privileged parties of
all stripes, and many others are masterful bullshitters to urge
"curation," censorship, withholding, redacting information by
which secretkeepers empower themselves against the public by
"self-regulated" access, that is self-serving.
It is ridiculous to believe technical crypto by itself will not be subverted
for political purposes, that mathematics will provide sufficient protection
against wily opponents lawfully empowered to use any methods required
to exploit vulnerabilities in people, technology, governance (standards
setting, education, contracts, advisory boards, prizes, leaks, bribery,
coercion -- partially listed in the troll tools, but far from all).
 From day one and continuing, cypherpunks warned of the unavoidable
corruption of the list by malevolent subscribers, as well as of the
Internet and digital technology in general. This malevolence has
come to pass worldwide, through a range of treacheries from
anonymization to crypto to HTTPS to OTR to leak sites to universities,
to whatever tool is funded and promoted as the hot shit latest means
to defy authority. Authority always wins. As authority bullshits and
honors and hires those too timid to exceed conventional cowardice.
Few cypherpunks have gone to jail for their convictions, many more have
gone on to pretty good paying jobs, start-ups, buy-outs by IBM, MS, Cisco,
Google, others in cahoots with authority. But some have seduced others to
go to jail, crying ACLU-EFF-Greenwald grade crocodile tears at the injustice
(advertising "donate to us" for the poor suckers). Blaming the victim of
this seduction is rife as it is in deliberately faulty, highly monetized comsec.
If all goes well, cataclismic cyberwar will provide the doomsday climax to

@_subject: Julian Assange on Rubber-hose proof (cryptographically 
Precedence: bulk
Here's a copy of some correspondence in relation to my implementation
of a `rubber hose proof' (cryptographically deniable) file system
(actually implimented as a block device on which you can mount any
file system). I'm happy with the cryptographic strength of the system
(but feel free to comment anyway). That said, I'm not convinced that
my avoidance of media (i.e disk surface) analysis attacks (which could
potentially show the pre-sense or otherwise of cryptographic file
systems other than the "duress" ones) is entirely effective. I'd like
some comment from gauss-ridden declassification guru's here :)
Here's how I'm implementing `aspects' in Rubberhose/marutukku;
`aspect' is the term I'm using to refer to the
cryptographically-deniable (i.e rubber-hose-proofed) "portion", of a
maru extent i.e it's a different _aspect_ (view) of the same
underlying physical block extent.
I decided that random split lengths don't add to the security of the
scheme - only 2x from my calculations - which isn't enough to warrant
the increase in memory use and complexity involved.  The extent is
simply divided up into n splits (say 1024 or one every 256k, whichever
is smaller). Each aspect has an encrypted 32bit block remap list
(which is simply a linear array because of the fixed split size).  A
split avoidance bit-map is created from these per-aspect remap lists
on instantiation of the aspects. An individual aspect looks like so
(when saved):
typedef struct
     m_u32 keySum; /* key checksum */
     u_char masterKey[MAX_KEY];
     u_char latticeCipherType, blockCipherType;
     u_char pad[MAX_BLOCK - (4 + MAX_KEY + 1 + 1) % MAX_BLOCK]; /* block align */
} maruCycle;
typedef struct
     maruCycle cycle;
     u_char keySalt[MAX_PASSPHRASE];
     maruLatticeKey latticeKeySalt[2];
     u_char blockIV[MAX_FS_BLOCK_SIZE];
     u_char latticeSalt[2*MAX_LATTICE_DEPTH*MAX_BLOCK_KEY]; /* must be 64 aligned */
     m_u32 remap[MAX_SPLITS];
     m_u32 iterations;
     maruCipher keyCipherType;
} maruHeaderAspect;
There are an array of (8 by default) of these constructs in a maruHeader.
The smap accessor macros are simple:
	SMAP_SET(p, n) (((p))[(n)/(sizeof(maruSmap)*8)] |= (1 << ((n) % (sizeof(maruSmap)*8))))
	SMAP_CLR(p, n) (((p))[(n)/(sizeof(maruSmap)*8)] &= ~ (1 << ((n) % (sizeof(maruSmap)*8))))
	SMAP_ISSET(p, n) (((p))[(n)/(sizeof(maruSmap)*8)] & (1 << ((n) % (sizeof(maruSmap)*8))))
By default, each unused maruHeaderAspect struct contains random noise
(except for keyCipherType, which defaults to being the same for all
aspects) and is of course indistinguishable from a valid maruAspect
without the associated key.
Instantiation example:
Say you have three valid aspects, a1, a2 and a3. Arbitrarily, you have
chosen a1 to be the simple duress aspect (i.e ``you expect us to
believe you have solitary letter of donation to the Polit Bureau Ball
in your entire encrypted file system?! Do you know what this is Nikov?
. THIS is the finest cryptanalytic device known to
man. THIS is a RUBBERHOSE! *thwap* *thwunk* *boink*. Now... what's the
*real* key Nikov... or should we call you... Nikolay Bukharin?''), a2 to
be the limited disclosure aspect ("Dear diary. Nikita, Ivan, Boris and
came over today and smoked a *shit load* of hash. Not wanting to
offend, I had a toke, but like that capitalist dog
^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H illustious leader of the freeworld, was
careful not to inhale.") and a3 has your ice-9 formula nicely tucked
You decide one fine morning that you want to add an ATP pre-cursor as
a catalyst to your ice-9 recipe of destruction (ostensibly, you plan
to generate this stuff from cultures of genetically modified mouse
liver cell mitochondria), and provide the a1, a2 and a3 pass-phrases.
a1, a2 and a3 are decrypted. the aspect remap is parsed and used to
create the physical block "avoidance" map (checking for conflicts
along the way).
Joyous about the frozen seas to come, you copy the ATP pre-cursor
catalyst into a3 and the file system tries to write a new block - e.g
b28 - to a3.  b28 is translated through the a3 remap table to b-1
(unallocated). A random block remap number is generated e.g b595 and
tested against the avoidance smap. If free, it is marked and chosen to
be the new a3 mapping, otherwise the algorithm simply does a circular
hunt for the next free entry in the avoidance smap.
Naturally, reading only requires the key of the aspect you are
interested in (divulging). Writing to one aspect without the keys to
the other aspects will randomly trash them as new splits are assigned.
This would be the simple end of it, were it not but for magnetic
domain leakage/disk surface wear analysis attacks. Theoretically, this
sort of attack could used to demonstrate access patterns by the drive
head in regions outside those used by the duress aspect blocks. What
we want to do here is to make sure the non-data carrying
magnetic/other properties of the disk substrate are as close to a
Jackson Pollock painting as is possible. i.e totally random :) Three
methods are used:
All aspects are defined to take up 100% of the marutukku extent from
the file-system perspective - this is essential to our deniability
scheme. This works fine with most file-systems - e.g UFS, because they
only write to a small fraction of their addressable blocks when
formatted - i.a few super-blocks and inode, rather than zeroing every
block, and so split usage for a given aspect reflects population of
the file system that pertains to it.

The USA set up a slave-owning aristocracy to govern, still lives as US Senate

Standard operating procedure to copy the oppressor, as if Argentina is not
angling for Trump's (and USA's) increased lucrative bribery to solons,
but most of all for military, police and spy largesse.
Hardly original, Trump's diplomatic and military agenda aims to buy and
threaten foreign leaders, continuing the 274-year history of the US's primary
economic, political and educational goals have been just that, from Indian
genocide and Civil Wars to WW1 and WW2, Korea, Vietnam, Middle East

killing technology., and nearly every president has cooked up a war to boost
the economy and maintain political power -- both parties aggressors in
pay to natsecker industry of gov-com-org-edu-faith.

ACLU has become primarily a money-raising endeavor, paying its staff extremely generous salaries and perks. It turns down requests which does not promise fund-raising prospects. In this it is like the Greenwalds who rush to promote very lucrative grants for high-profile projects. Check out the ACLU main site for its gold-plated campaigns and screeching about contributions.

CODE GIRLS
The Untold Story of the American Women Code Breakers of World War II
By Liza Mundy
Describes the experiences of several thousand American women who spent the war years in Washington, untangling the clandestine messages sent by the Japanese and German militaries and diplomatic corps. At a time when even well-educated women were not encouraged to have careers ­ much less compete with men to demonstrate their mastery of arcane, technical skills ­ this hiring frenzy represented a dramatic shift. The same social experiment was simultaneously unfolding on the other side of the Atlantic. The British debutantes and their middle-class peers recruited to work at the secret Bletchley Park code-breaking operation came to outnumber the men.
Mundys narrative turns thrilling as she chronicles the eureka moments when the women succeed in cracking codes, relying on a mixture of mathematical expertise, memorization and occasional leaps of intuition. ...
At the end of the war, virtually all of the female code breakers were given their walking papers and returned to civilian life. Only a few superstars were asked to stay on (among them Ann Caracristi, who went on to become the first female deputy director of the National Security Agency).
For these accomplished and resourceful women, who had been given a heady taste of professional success, it was jarring to have to fight to be accepted to top graduate programs on the G.I. Bill or embark on traditional paths as wives and mothers. Warned not to reveal their secret wartime lives, many remained silent about their valuable service. Thanks to Mundys book, which deftly conveys both the puzzle-solving complexities and the emotion and drama of this era, their stories will live on.

Very little from Snowden's many years as CIA employee prior to short-term as NSA contractor has been revealed. Turf battles between the two agencies are legendary, including planting their spies in each other's innards. CIA favors human agents, NSA technology.
This suggests Snowden was a CIA implant to out (selective) NSA technology. If so, it certainly worked, at least for a while until NSA used the operation to beef up funding for new and possibly stronger technology. Just look at its vast construction of MD tech temples and recruiting at universities.
To be sure all the 9/11-fattened spies benefited from Snowden's operation, and in that his op is hardly new, the spies have been running breaches for decades to enhance funding and deepening secrecy. They all work in concert at this, exchanging tips and perks with foreign spies.
Leaks, aka unauthorized disclosures, have been part of this from day one of spying, not just modern, but also ancient, even neanderthal. Spies beget spies, secrecy begets secrecy, ostensible betrayals beget ostensible betrayals. Favored journalists beget favored journalists. Outlaw mavericks beget the same.
The sanctimonious name "national security" is a relatively new moniker, circa 1947 in he US, but so are nations rather than royalties and theocracies. One way to tell who runs the shows is by looking at their self-vaunting monuments. In the case of CIA and NSA, look at their infrastructure for humans and technology, respectively.
Digital technology is an NSA operation, for example, journalism and academia run by CIA. Division between the two established by the National Security Act of 1947. CIA remained ostentatously above board, NSA hiding behind No Such Agency.
I assume Snowden is still working for CIA, bound by a secrecy agreement until he dies, not the secrecy-porous for NSA contractors. Presumbably Moscow assesses him this way, and will persistently suck his mind and blood as they run his worldwide recruiting operation in cahoots with CIA, NSA hot on their heels but winded by obesity.
Greenwald is a vain, useful idiot in this charade. So too Assange.

6 September 2002
ANNOUNCEMENT: Cypherpunks Meeting and Party/BBQ, Saturday, September 14th, 2002. Tim May's house, Corralitos, California.
* WHAT?: Ten years ago this month the first Cypherpunks meeting. Cypherpunks meeting and party. Several interesting talks are planned, though nothing of the usual "political action" sort. A flexible agenda will be posted at the meeting. I am hoping we can have as stimulating a discussion as we had at our first meetings a decade ago.
* WHEN?: Saturday, September 14th, 1 p.m. to "late." (A limited amount of people can stay overnight--ask me about it.) Formal talks will probably run for several hours, then the informal and BBQ/party takes over. People can arrive as early as 1 p.m. and hang out, but the formal agenda will start promptly at 2.
* WHERE?: Tim May's house in Corralitos, east of Santa Cruz and north of Watsonville. 427 Allan Lane, Corralitos. Detailed driving instructions at the end of this message...or use one of the many mappers on the Net. It takes about an hour to get from Sunnyvale to my house, about 40 miles, so plan your travel accordingly.
* WHO?: Cypherpunks and friends who are not narcs or Feds. Contrary to some meetings in the past, this is NOT an "open meeting, open to all." That strategy worked OK for some meetings in public places where certain kinds of software were to be distributed. But my house is a private residence. I have nothing against legitimate cops enforcing legitimate laws, but I don't want persecutors traipsing through my house, perhaps planting evidence, looking for signs of illegal activities or grounds for a warrant, etc. This is a PRIVATE RESIDENCE and I intend to escort to the door anyone who is unknown to others. If you are a lurker who doesn't know anybody and you want to attend, send me e-mail and we'll arrange something.
* WHAT ELSE?: Parking may be tight. And because of the distance, carpooling with your friends would be good. A cat lives in the house...don't leave any doors open, and tell me if you see him get out.
* CHILDREN?: My house is not child-friendly, and I don't have time to make sure nothing dangerous is exposed. Please leave children out of this meeting/party.
* FOOD: If you stay for the evening BBQ and party, bring something to share. Don't everyone bring a bag of chips! The Corralitos Market is a popular place for meats, sausages, etc. (Don't everyone bring sausages, either!) And if you drink, remember the drive home.
--Tim May (location instructions below)
Getting to Tim May's house in Corralitos:
427 Allan Lane (MapQuest works well). 831-728-0152
 From Santa Cruz, south on Highway 1. Take Freedom Boulevard exit in Aptos. Go inland, on Freedom Blvd.  Travel about 5 miles, to first stop sign. Take a left on Corralitos Road. At the the next stop sign, the Corralitos Market (good sausages!) will be on your left. Just before the stop sign, bear right on Brown's Valley Road. Cross bridge and then bear left as Brown's Valley Road turns. Travel about one mile to Allan Lane, on the right.
Allan Lane is at about the "360" mailbox point on Brown's Valley Road...if you go too far and enter the redwoods, turn back! Drive to top of hill on Allan Lane.  At top, bear left, over a small rise, past a house on the left, then down my driveway. My house will be the white stucco semi-Spanish style, with a red Explorer and black Mercedes in the driveway.
Note for parties: You can park either in my driveway or at the top of the hill and walk a few hundred feet. Don't block any driveways!
 From points south of Santa Cruz, take Green Valley Road exit off of Highway 1. Travel about 2 miles to Freedom Boulevard. Turn left. Then right at Corralitos Road.

Hi there,
I am a reporter at Wired News. We received notice of the upcoming Cypherpunks 10th anniversary bash. I am thinking of writing a short article about the history and current status of the cypherpunk community.
Obviously, things have changed a lot in the last 10 years. I imagine that you and other cypherpunks would have much to say on the topic. Please feel free to rant and rave to me about whatever you feel would be relevant to this kind of article.
When did the Cypherpunks come into existence? Who were the founding members? What was the inital purpose? What kinds of people are involved?
Who (socially, I mean, not names!) exactly are the members of the group? How many at any one time? Is it a rotating membership, with people coming and going?
There has been a substantial amount of press dedicated to the Cypherpunks, what's been the community response?
Have their been internal discussions about the repercussions of the media's involvement and the like?
Wired News had a very familiar relationship with the cypherpunks - has it been viewed as a positive thing?
Have the ideals of the group changed over the years?
Are there any manifestos or official statements from the group that I can access?
What are the future plans for the cypherpunks?
I attempted to access cypherpunks.com but most of the links are dead, why isn't anyone maintaining it? Or is it unrelated to the current community?
With whom else are the cypherpunks allied?
What do you, personally, have to say about the future of the Internet, privacy, legislation, hacking, phreaking, cyber terrorism, the governement. etc?
And finally, who else should I be talking to?
Thanks for your time. I am hoping to get the story done before the end of next week (i.e., before the actual party.) Of course, I would never publish the location of the party or any other information that you don't feel comfortable about.
Danit Lidor
I am also available at 415.276.3925. Please leave me a message if I'm away from my desk. I am more than happy to call you back.

James Ellis was forerunner of Cocks' PKC in 1970, "conceived of the possibility of "non-secret encryption", more commonly termed public-key Diffie-Hellman is sometimes suggested to have been aided by NSA whispered nudging of GCHQ classified efforts. Diffie denies this. To be sure, crypto leaking strengths and vulns is inherent in crypto wars. Not many know of Diffie's TEMPEST hair which bypasses NSA's TSCM during visits.

@_subject: Tim May 1992 Post on Future of Cyberspace/Cryptology/Digital 
Tim May 1992 Post on Future of Cyberspace/Cryptology/Digital Source: Some thoughts on the recent meetings and what we're doing:
1. The importance of trading physical goods in the Crypto Anarchy
This, in my view, has been given undue and misleading importance.
Physical goods are inherently easy to trace through remailers (via
sniffers, radioactive tracers, weight of packages, and many other
physical cues), are hard to store physically (imagine getting 100
parcels for later remailing), and, most importantly, have none of the
"envelope within envelope within...." protection accorded to the bits
of a cryptographic remailing, or DC-Net, system! The elegance of
cryptographic protocols is lost with physical goods.
Furthermore, physical delivery of any good, whether drugs, stolen
missile components, antiquities and art items, whatever, is
fundamentally a hard problem to solve...smugglers and thieves have
been dealing this since the beginning of time. Stings can be easily
arranged, delivery is not anonymous (one merely watches who takes
delivery, or who opens a train station locker, etc....this is all SOP
for narcs and counterespionage types), and a raid on a remailing
entity will result in confiscation of the physical goods and (likely)
prosecution of those caught holding the stuff. (Raiding a bit
remailing entity produces only random-appearing bits...granted, the
authorities may well outlaw bit remailing, or use the RICO and
conspiracy/sedition laws to prosecute, but that's another topic.)
Our recent emphasis on physical goods, and all the ideas pouring in on
what other kinds of "contraband" besides drugs can be used, is
misleading. None of the richness of the cryptographic world is
faithfully preserved. I urge we get back to our roots and deal only
with things that can be expressed purely in bit form.
2. The "colonization of cyberspace" does not mean there is no
interaction with the physical world, of course. But that interaction
can be mediated with money made by converting information or digital
money into physical money. Several methods for this conversion path
can be considered:
-Alice sells information in the cyberspace domain for the equivalent
of, say, $30,000. She converts this to "real" dollars by using an
escrow entity which hold both sides of the transaction until it's
completed. They then mail the information to the purchaser and send an
ordinary check "for services rendered" to Alice for $30K. She reports
it on her taxes, probably as a "consulting fee" (for which essentially
no government supervision currently exists, nor is likely to....), and
the conversion has taken place. (Note: there are still elements of
trust involved, notably involving the escrow agent, but trust works
pretty well for many things, especially when reputations are at
stake. Understanding how real businesses depend on reputations is a
missing part of modern cryptology analyses of transactions...the
protocol analyzers and number theorists almost never take into account
how reputations work in the real world, But I digress.)
-Alice and Bob trade information such that Bob gets the information
worth about $30K, as above, and Alice gets another piece of
information she can use in the "real world" that is worth about $30K.
This might be stock tips, or, better, information she can turn around
and sell in the "open market" of a service like AMIX! There are lots
of wrinkles, inefficiencies, etc., to be worked out.
-And then there is digital money. You all know about this, or should.
David Chaum, DigiCash, blinded notes, credentials, etc. The handout
for the first meeting had a glossary of terms. (IMHO, we should be
spending more of our time at our meeting discussing this, and less in
playing more interations of the Game.)
The fascinating novel "Snow Crash," by Neil Stephenson, makes a
mistake in having Hiro Protagonist a very wealthy man in the Metaverse
(Stephenson's term for the virtual reality cyberspace) but a very poor
man in the Real World. Information _is_ money. Information is liquid,
flows across borders, and is generally convertible into real money.
(One simple conversion strategy, alluded to above, is for Alice to
sell her information for, say, $500K, and then to receive a
"consulting contract," perhaps called a "retainer," of $50K a year for
the next 20 years. Her retainer is fully legal, is perhaps handled
through cut-outs who specialize in this kind of thing, and is a
low-risk way to "launder" money from cyberspace into the real world. I
have a lot more to say on these schemes, perhaps later.)
3. Are we emphasizing "The Game" too much?
If the goal is to produce a paper-based game, similar to "Monopoly" or
fantasy role-playing games, then I suppose more practice is needed.
But I'm not sure how worthwhile it is to try to design such a game.
(Those who wish to should do so, then commercialize it, and become the
Avalon Hill of crypto games!)
If the goal is educational, for newly interested folks, then I also
question how much more effort should be put into it. The ideas of
anonymous remailers, of digital money, etc., are, I think, gotten
across in the first 60 minutes of the game, especially if some of the
formalism is first explained (as it was at the first game, where
digital mixes, tamper-resistand modules for implementing mixes, the
"Dining Cryptographers Protocol," and digital money had all been
freshly covered, so participants were putting the theory to test).
I found the first game was instructive, the second much less so (and
_not_ because of the focus on drug selling...that was a relatively
minor issue). My impression is that many of the newcomers--and they
should jump in here with their own reactions (too bad we don't have
hypertext links!)--didn't really know how remailing mixes work, how
digital psueodnyms can protect privacy in transactions, and how the
"Game" was intended to exercise these concepts.
4. We need to talk about the charter or purpose of the "Cypherpunks"
or "Cryptology Amateurs for Social Irresponsibility" (CASI--Eric
Hughes's term) group.
-Is it mostly educational?
-Is it a lobbying group, as are EFF, CPSR, and the like?
-Is it to produce remailers, digital money, and other programming?
-Is it subversive?
Now clearly we can't say it's subversive (any bets on who's gatewaying
these messages to Other Listeners?). But we also don't want to skew
things toward "YALG" (Yet Another Lobbying Group), nor do we want to
be a spoon-feeding educational group for people with a casual (and
transient) interest in crypto stuff.
5. There have have been several messages so far about worries about
the legal implications of these topics, about how some
corporate-affiliated subscribers will desubscribe "real fast" if
certain discussion trends continue, and so on. Now we can't please
everybody, but maybe we ought to talk about this sensitive issue soon,
and _in person_.
Since it relates to our charter, Point 4 above, I recommend we do this
at our next meeting. I'd favor that over another iteration of the
In conclusion, we are in at the beginning of Something Big. While I'm
somewhat skeptical about the claims for things like nanotech, I see
this whole cyberspace/cryptology/digital money/transnationalism ball of
wax being _much_ easier to implement. Networks are multiplying beyond
any hope of government control, bandwidths are skyrocketing, CPUs are
putting awesome power on our desktops, PGP is generating incredible
interest, and social trends are making the time right for crypto
I look forward to hearing your views.

Tim relished hurling offensive language in the way Trump (and a slew of others) do against herdish PC. But he does not curse and spout vulgarities as if linguistic propriety enhances credibility, hard to imagine him bragging of grabbing pussies.
Those who knew him praise his courtesy and generosity face to face, in contrast to his contrarian, disputatious online persona. This contrast is what differs highly confident, courageous, intelligent Tim from always insulting, insecure, cowardly, ignorant Trump and similar pretentious grandstanders.
The cpunks potpourri of personas and means of expression is what made it so addictive to those tired of numbing public and professional prevariacative discourse of education, law, politics, diplomacy, warmaking, finance, art, religion, nearly all sounding and meaning much the same: mono-educated, censorious, judgmental, biased, intolerant, smooth-talking lies and false promises, in the end treacherous, often murderous, against anyone who refused to obey house rules. Tim mocked and ridiculed by stating openly what these genocidal supremacists said and planned and executed in secret inside their authoritarian cults.
He understood the frontier had closed, anarcho-libertarians the last holdouts, the East Coast Globalist  hordes rapidly exterminating dissidents, rebels, outcasts. Pockets of resistance, like cpunks, anonymists, official secrecy opponents, grew quieter, he did not. So faced late in life ridicule and stigma. No problema for Tim, that.

If you are a lurker who doesn't know anybody and you want to attend, send me e-mail and we'll arrange something.
* WHAT ELSE?: Parking may be tight. And because of the distance, carpooling with your friends would be good. A cat lives in the house...don't leave any doors open, and tell me if you see him get out.
* CHILDREN?: My house is not child-friendly, and I don't have time to make sure nothing dangerous is exposed. Please leave children out of this meeting/party.
* FOOD: If you stay for the evening BBQ and party, bring something to share. Don't everyone bring a bag of chips! The Corralitos Market is a popular place for meats, sausages, etc. (Don't everyone bring sausages, either!) And if you drink, remember the drive home.
--Tim May (location instructions below)
Getting to Tim May's house in Corralitos:
427 Allan Lane (MapQuest works well). 831-728-0152
 From Santa Cruz, south on Highway 1. Take Freedom Boulevard exit in Aptos. Go inland, on Freedom Blvd.  Travel about 5 miles, to first stop sign. Take a left on Corralitos Road. At the the next stop sign, the Corralitos Market (good sausages!) will be on your left. Just before the stop sign, bear right on Brown's Valley Road. Cross bridge and then bear left as Brown's Valley Road turns. Travel about one mile to Allan Lane, on the right.
Allan Lane is at about the "360" mailbox point on Brown's Valley Road...if you go too far and enter the redwoods, turn back! Drive to top of hill on Allan Lane.  At top, bear left, over a small rise, past a house on the left, then down my driveway. My house will be the white stucco semi-Spanish style, with a red Explorer and black Mercedes in the driveway.
Note for parties: You can park either in my driveway or at the top of the hill and walk a few hundred feet. Don't block any driveways!
 From points south of Santa Cruz, take Green Valley Road exit off of Highway 1. Travel about 2 miles to Freedom Boulevard. Turn left. Then right at Corralitos Road.

Hi there,
I am a reporter at Wired News. We received notice of the upcoming Cypherpunks 10th anniversary bash. I am thinking of writing a short article about the history and current status of the cypherpunk community.
Obviously, things have changed a lot in the last 10 years. I imagine that you and other cypherpunks would have much to say on the topic. Please feel free to rant and rave to me about whatever you feel would be relevant to this kind of article.
When did the Cypherpunks come into existence? Who were the founding members? What was the inital purpose? What kinds of people are involved?
Who (socially, I mean, not names!) exactly are the members of the group? How many at any one time? Is it a rotating membership, with people coming and going?
There has been a substantial amount of press dedicated to the Cypherpunks, what's been the community response?
Have their been internal discussions about the repercussions of the media's involvement and the like?
Wired News had a very familiar relationship with the cypherpunks - has it been viewed as a positive thing?
Have the ideals of the group changed over the years?
Are there any manifestos or official statements from the group that I can access?
What are the future plans for the cypherpunks?
I attempted to access cypherpunks.com but most of the links are dead, why isn't anyone maintaining it? Or is it unrelated to the current community?
With whom else are the cypherpunks allied?
What do you, personally, have to say about the future of the Internet, privacy, legislation, hacking, phreaking, cyber terrorism, the governement. etc?
And finally, who else should I be talking to?
Thanks for your time. I am hoping to get the story done before the end of next week (i.e., before the actual party.) Of course, I would never publish the location of the party or any other information that you don't feel comfortable about.
Danit Lidor
I am also available at 415.276.3925. Please leave me a message if I'm away from my desk. I am more than happy to call you back.

James Ellis was forerunner of Cocks' PKC in 1970, "conceived of the possibility of "non-secret encryption", more commonly termed public-key Diffie-Hellman is sometimes suggested to have been aided by NSA whispered nudging of GCHQ classified efforts. Diffie denies this. To be sure, crypto leaking strengths and vulns is inherent in crypto wars. Not many know of Diffie's TEMPEST hair which bypasses NSA's TSCM during visits.

@_subject: Tim May 1992 Post on Future of Cyberspace/Cryptology/Digital 
Tim May 1992 Post on Future of Cyberspace/Cryptology/Digital Source: Some thoughts on the recent meetings and what we're doing:
1. The importance of trading physical goods in the Crypto Anarchy
This, in my view, has been given undue and misleading importance.
Physical goods are inherently easy to trace through remailers (via
sniffers, radioactive tracers, weight of packages, and many other
physical cues), are hard to store physically (imagine getting 100
parcels for later remailing), and, most importantly, have none of the
"envelope within envelope within...." protection accorded to the bits
of a cryptographic remailing, or DC-Net, system! The elegance of
cryptographic protocols is lost with physical goods.
Furthermore, physical delivery of any good, whether drugs, stolen
missile components, antiquities and art items, whatever, is
fundamentally a hard problem to solve...smugglers and thieves have
been dealing this since the beginning of time. Stings can be easily
arranged, delivery is not anonymous (one merely watches who takes
delivery, or who opens a train station locker, etc....this is all SOP
for narcs and counterespionage types), and a raid on a remailing
entity will result in confiscation of the physical goods and (likely)
prosecution of those caught holding the stuff. (Raiding a bit
remailing entity produces only random-appearing bits...granted, the
authorities may well outlaw bit remailing, or use the RICO and
conspiracy/sedition laws to prosecute, but that's another topic.)
Our recent emphasis on physical goods, and all the ideas pouring in on
what other kinds of "contraband" besides drugs can be used, is
misleading. None of the richness of the cryptographic world is
faithfully preserved. I urge we get back to our roots and deal only
with things that can be expressed purely in bit form.
2. The "colonization of cyberspace" does not mean there is no
interaction with the physical world, of course. But that interaction
can be mediated with money made by converting information or digital
money into physical money. Several methods for this conversion path
can be considered:
-Alice sells information in the cyberspace domain for the equivalent
of, say, $30,000. She converts this to "real" dollars by using an
escrow entity which hold both sides of the transaction until it's
completed. They then mail the information to the purchaser and send an
ordinary check "for services rendered" to Alice for $30K. She reports
it on her taxes, probably as a "consulting fee" (for which essentially
no government supervision currently exists, nor is likely to....), and
the conversion has taken place. (Note: there are still elements of
trust involved, notably involving the escrow agent, but trust works
pretty well for many things, especially when reputations are at
stake. Understanding how real businesses depend on reputations is a
missing part of modern cryptology analyses of transactions...the
protocol analyzers and number theorists almost never take into account
how reputations work in the real world, But I digress.)
-Alice and Bob trade information such that Bob gets the information
worth about $30K, as above, and Alice gets another piece of
information she can use in the "real world" that is worth about $30K.
This might be stock tips, or, better, information she can turn around
and sell in the "open market" of a service like AMIX! There are lots
of wrinkles, inefficiencies, etc., to be worked out.
-And then there is digital money. You all know about this, or should.
David Chaum, DigiCash, blinded notes, credentials, etc. The handout
for the first meeting had a glossary of terms. (IMHO, we should be
spending more of our time at our meeting discussing this, and less in
playing more interations of the Game.)
The fascinating novel "Snow Crash," by Neil Stephenson, makes a
mistake in having Hiro Protagonist a very wealthy man in the Metaverse
(Stephenson's term for the virtual reality cyberspace) but a very poor
man in the Real World. Information _is_ money. Information is liquid,
flows across borders, and is generally convertible into real money.
(One simple conversion strategy, alluded to above, is for Alice to
sell her information for, say, $500K, and then to receive a
"consulting contract," perhaps called a "retainer," of $50K a year for
the next 20 years. Her retainer is fully legal, is perhaps handled
through cut-outs who specialize in this kind of thing, and is a
low-risk way to "launder" money from cyberspace into the real world. I
have a lot more to say on these schemes, perhaps later.)
3. Are we emphasizing "The Game" too much?
If the goal is to produce a paper-based game, similar to "Monopoly" or
fantasy role-playing games, then I suppose more practice is needed.
But I'm not sure how worthwhile it is to try to design such a game.
(Those who wish to should do so, then commercialize it, and become the
Avalon Hill of crypto games!)
If the goal is educational, for newly interested folks, then I also
question how much more effort should be put into it. The ideas of
anonymous remailers, of digital money, etc., are, I think, gotten
across in the first 60 minutes of the game, especially if some of the
formalism is first explained (as it was at the first game, where
digital mixes, tamper-resistand modules for implementing mixes, the
"Dining Cryptographers Protocol," and digital money had all been
freshly covered, so participants were putting the theory to test).
I found the first game was instructive, the second much less so (and
_not_ because of the focus on drug selling...that was a relatively
minor issue). My impression is that many of the newcomers--and they
should jump in here with their own reactions (too bad we don't have
hypertext links!)--didn't really know how remailing mixes work, how
digital psueodnyms can protect privacy in transactions, and how the
"Game" was intended to exercise these concepts.
4. We need to talk about the charter or purpose of the "Cypherpunks"
or "Cryptology Amateurs for Social Irresponsibility" (CASI--Eric
Hughes's term) group.
-Is it mostly educational?
-Is it a lobbying group, as are EFF, CPSR, and the like?
-Is it to produce remailers, digital money, and other programming?
-Is it subversive?
Now clearly we can't say it's subversive (any bets on who's gatewaying
these messages to Other Listeners?). But we also don't want to skew
things toward "YALG" (Yet Another Lobbying Group), nor do we want to
be a spoon-feeding educational group for people with a casual (and
transient) interest in crypto stuff.
5. There have have been several messages so far about worries about
the legal implications of these topics, about how some
corporate-affiliated subscribers will desubscribe "real fast" if
certain discussion trends continue, and so on. Now we can't please
everybody, but maybe we ought to talk about this sensitive issue soon,
and _in person_.
Since it relates to our charter, Point 4 above, I recommend we do this
at our next meeting. I'd favor that over another iteration of the
In conclusion, we are in at the beginning of Something Big. While I'm
somewhat skeptical about the claims for things like nanotech, I see
this whole cyberspace/cryptology/digital money/transnationalism ball of
wax being _much_ easier to implement. Networks are multiplying beyond
any hope of government control, bandwidths are skyrocketing, CPUs are
putting awesome power on our desktops, PGP is generating incredible
interest, and social trends are making the time right for crypto
I look forward to hearing your views.

Tim relished hurling offensive language in the way Trump (and a slew of others) do against herdish PC. But he does not curse and spout vulgarities as if linguistic propriety enhances credibility, hard to imagine him bragging of grabbing pussies.
Those who knew him praise his courtesy and generosity face to face, in contrast to his contrarian, disputatious online persona. This contrast is what differs highly confident, courageous, intelligent Tim from always insulting, insecure, cowardly, ignorant Trump and similar pretentious grandstanders.
The cpunks potpourri of personas and means of expression is what made it so addictive to those tired of numbing public and professional prevariacative discourse of education, law, politics, diplomacy, warmaking, finance, art, religion, nearly all sounding and meaning much the same: mono-educated, censorious, judgmental, biased, intolerant, smooth-talking lies and false promises, in the end treacherous, often murderous, against anyone who refused to obey house rules. Tim mocked and ridiculed by stating openly what these genocidal supremacists said and planned and executed in secret inside their authoritarian cults.
He understood the frontier had closed, anarcho-libertarians the last holdouts, the East Coast Globalist  hordes rapidly exterminating dissidents, rebels, outcasts. Pockets of resistance, like cpunks, anonymists, official secrecy opponents, grew quieter, he did not. So faced late in life ridicule and stigma. No problema for Tim, that.

Matt Taibbi reports on Assange in Rolling Stone in a one of the more salient grasps of what journalism has missed about WikiLeaks feeding its maw.
A noteworthy observation is how all the risk is taken by leakers not by publishers and journalists -- nor by WikiLeaks and Assange.
Nearly every major leak to WikiLeaks (and the media) has led to the leaker being hammered while the publishers are awarded prizes, as with WikiLeaks.
That is evident from the number of leakers who have been severly punished while WikiLeaks and Assange is showered with glory.and repetitive news coverage. Wikipedia's WikiLeaks entry is grotesque.
That's asymmetric racketeering side of leakage, to the benefit of journalists, publishers, lawyers and public interest organizations, all of whom are granted special privileges by authorities and in many cases handsome donations from fat cats through tax benefits.
Its as if by overdoing lauding Assange and WikiLeaks those who have taken the highest risk can be slighted with impunity. Only fools would leak if they knew what is in store for them, not just the brief attention dispensed by outlets.
Anonymity, non-tracability and comsec, always, if leak you must. Before proceeding, think twice, thrice, avoid believing the glory stories. Else you're cannon fodder for information generals.

Gun control for men, enforced by hanging or castration if caught with a gun, especially military weaponry and WMD, would reduce predation on women and weaker peoples.

WTC7 had emergency generator fuel tanks on upper floors which contributed to the fire (revised codes now prohibit that, so it is claimed, however, special agencies (ie, spies) can get what they want). NIST is ruled by the needs of special agencies, as with all official agencies, including what information is released to the public (considered indistinguishable from terrorists).
WTC7's fuel tanks were not designed to withstand exceptional forces, say, as bladders, so fractured.
Supertalls have introduced a slew of risky practices, most never tested in the field over long duration, only surmised in codes and experiments, and above all, coutured as safe by public relations.
Any building over 75 feet tall (reach of firefighter ladders) is exceptionally dangerous. Professionals, officals and the real estate industry have long used elaborate justifications and finely-crafted codes to camouflage the danger, aided and abetted by the insurance industry.
Fortuitously, those responsibile for the potential calamities favor highest floors for offices and homes, biggest and hardest to reach McMansion spreads, all dense with flammables, seemingly secure as vaults which turn out to be inescapable crematoria.

Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth is a propaganda racket to excuse architects and engineers for culpability in the WTC collapses. A/Es are all too willing to cut corners for developers, then when shit happens declare they abided "standards of the profession" or as in the WTC disaster assert explosives did it. Acts of god, unexpected forces, beyond the standards of the profession are whipped out in concert to cover asses, and unite in bringing in dupes like fire fighters to build public support. Con artists working the crowd, a perfect fit for the Trump era.
FWIW, the structural engineer of the Twin Towers, Leslie Robertson, PE, has rebuilt his reputation and is now the go-to engineer for peer review of high rises, reviews inaugurated as a result of 9/11. The development industry adores these  compliant engineers, as do politicians who give not a shit about public safety, instead seek campaign contributions and easy going building department reviews. NYC Department of Buildings Chief Engineer has criticized lax peer review but is over-ruled by the higher-ups.

On the other hand, banning 8chan could set a bad precedent, and it could make it harder for law enforcement authorities to monitor violent extremists. Cloudflare, like other tech companies with a window onto dark internet activity, can share information about crimes with investigators.
Banning 8chan "would make our lives a lot easier," Mr. Prince said, "but it would make the job of law enforcement and controlling hate groups online harder."

Well foretold.
Disclosure of national security secrets has become a cult as addictive and crippling as non-disclosure, NDA v. leaks. Both suffer excessive secrecy as if wedded in a vainglorious conspiracy to claim to protect and reveal much but carefully dispense only that which buttresses their information and power control, eyeing and emulating one another to guarantee mutual benefits.
Neither fully serves the populace, instead disdains consumers, propagandas for product, adopts one another's practices, revolving doors their practitioners, aided and abetted by governments pretending to act on behalf of their subjects. Prosecutors, judges, legislators, executives, lockstep with each other and with their ostensible opponents, especially the governmentally-privileged wealthy, NGOs, journalists and manufactures of weaponry, hardware and software, paid and free.
Periodic orchestrated campaigns of Ellsbergs, Mannings, Snowdens, et al, signal breakaway insiders but merely confirm these are standard operating procedures for limited disclosure to boost reputations of disclosers and non-disclosers.
The Internet promised a change with free software, free access, free discourse, and immediately became dominated by practitioners of duplicity, openness concealing secrecy, deceptions long established. Witness this very forum and its vanity description on Wikipedia.
Or more telling, the Web, Wikimedia and Archive, kissing cousins of Google, SM, aggregators, bots, Tor, Deep Web, all dancing to the tune of TLAs with Terms of Service, privacy policies, redactions, omissions, secure submissions, open source vetting, which baldly disclose cooperation with authorities, trust us even so.
This is all well known and belabored, hustled and lipsticked, mea culpa. Still, there are possibilities for avoiding the domination of, and manipulation by, secretkeepers and their complicit opponents. One is to keep away from the most popular and promoted infosec, comsec, techsec, privacy, indeed, sec in all its permuations, especially that associated with natsec -- the civil-military-commercial-NGO occult.

Forgo "disclosure" and "non-disclosure," NGO and NDA; The "non" implicates, is misleading, moderates and dilutes opposition, is downright deceptive. So too is "dis." And "redact" and censor and secretkeep. Those who non, dis, redact, censor and secretkeep brag of knowing more than they tell, vaunt themselves as power games riggers in confession and appeal to their cult. They  demean and stigmatize those "who go too far" in unfettered revelation, "dumping" and failing to abide the rules of rigging.

Quite helpful suggestions. Probably should give up use of "leak" due to it becoming a marketing term, It now exaggerates, over-emphasizes content, "coutures," vaunts the predictable and traceable process from source to outlet.
Public library could work, just deposit material in a place to be found, discovered, almost accidentally, belatedly, maybe never, or right away, rather than greedily hyped to the max by media monsters which twist the content to favor the commercial industry (including the promo-addled gov, NGO, op-ed, essay, speech, SM, mail lists, et al).
Searching for and possibly sharing (or not) material on your own, at your own pace, at your own method, in a widely varying terrain, without spoon feeding by computer, print, TED, influencer, headliner, hustlers and promoters is far better because it limits external, highly-biased management of understanding and subsequent action.
Marketing has fucked consumers (marketing term) online and offline, not just with illusory privacy and security, but by excluding and demeaning "unimportant" information. It deliberately distorts, okay, lies and thereby encourages consumers to do the same as normality.
It may take an effort to overcome what "education" has instilled in its consumers about significance, obedience, careerism, language, technology, finance, arts, the works.
Leaks scream, most often incoherently, and induce screaming and babbling in response.
Silence is worth practicing, avoid being noticed, angered, goaded, offended and responsive behavior documented. Trust and truth these days are cheap desperate houswifey brands. So too democracy.

Decision concerning an application for a detention order in Case B 3167-19
[2019-06-03] Uppsala tingsrätt
Uppsala District Court has dismissed the public prosecutors request to detain Julian Assange in his absence. A detention order would not be in accordance with the principle of proportionality.
The public prosecutor reopened the preliminary investigation on May 13, 2019 and applied for a detention order at the Court on May 20, 2019. The suspicion of crime is rape, less serious incident, in Enköping in 2010.
The Court has, at a hearing today, decided that there is probable cause for the suspicion of rape, less serious incident, and that there is a risk that Julian Assange will fail to appear or in some other way avoid participation in the investigation and the following proceedings.
The Court has, however, found that a detention order would not be in accordance with the principle of proportionality. Since Julian Assange is serving a prison sentence the public prosecutor can proceed with the preliminary investigation by issuing a European Investigation Order.

"Changed the world" is marketing hyperbole. Items listed are worthy but hardly planetary-grade, indeed could be disparaged as fake-like headline news. Must point out "WikiLeaks" is a hyperbolizing marketing term, a successful branding campaign composed of two reconfigured, stolen, promotional terms
To be sure, copying predecessors, Martin Luther (and namesake King) posted a list which became a highly successful protestant branding campaign against the dominant only one true "catholic" faith and its erection-architecture-obsessed pederastic church, branding the proliferating, crowd-funding piles with namesaking-saints-listing to lipstick globalizing slaughterhouse murderers which inseminated this spoiled brat of a forever-bragging-branding-USA nation.
Credit, modestly stated, is most certainly due to Assange and his mostly anonymous cohorts for challenging USA and Four Others-branding their global slaughterhouse military with spy-sky lipsticking national security (C)(R) threats. And it may be necessary to exaggerate to gain attention against the vast disinformation hyperbolizing apparatus, lately the Internet, to turn the autocratic weaponized dupery into a counter, comical, dupery, even if only a pinprick.
Fine, then, exaggerate, lie, hide, valorize, but prepare for casualties, "innocents" imprisoned, stigmatized, murdered -- can it not be overstated the mass murderous policies of national security religion are ubiquitous, the tiny killings by armed individuals would not show up on a chart of what nations do, mass-scaled, to anonymous humans.
Lee Camp understates what Assange and company could represent, almost as if he dare not arouse the collaeral murdering giants any more than journalists and "leakers" do, that is exhibit fear and trembling, in hapless literature, as Kierkegaard did of the holy power to condemn and urge killing faithless dissenters.

"Open source" was, is, a magnificent ploy to get access to inventions and information that might have once been kept out of sight by the makers and a few associates. Open source crypto still robbing the guileless by the guilers. Internet, especially its web glorification, another. Wikipedia, Wayback, Google, SM, an almost endless stream of opportunities developed to lure with free services to grab consumer yearnings, opinions, fellows, followers, beliefs, fears, for feeding tailored operations (thx NSA) worldwide to ingest and digest.
Consider in this smearing thread, Snowden's openly disclosed 6 top secret years as CIA employee with specific tools and informarion of operations completely unrevealed while piddling months of contractor service with NSA is generously touted as if high-value golden coin.
In this roasting comedy, Snowden would be the one who runs the NSA snatch for CIA, NSA unable to admit that it was snookered by its number one competitor. CIA dancing in the aisles, toasting its win with one the oldest cons in history: the orchestrated aggrieved insider.
Assange has commented on WikiLeaks being used as a con op, melding accurate material with the bullshit disinfo. As with advertisers and prosecutors, though, he implies this mix is unavoidable, consumers and juries do not want shades of truth, the whole truth and nothing but must be declared to make sales and collaterally murder.
Comedian Camp is right to observe, the overtly guilty are not punished, they are rewarded with prizes and medals, to wit, sanitized Edward Snowden, the "Snowden era" grandly avowed.
Camp's listing of Snowden's family jewels would be fun. Also open source evangelists.

"FBI investigating 850 cases of potential domestic terrorism: The FBI has nearly 850 domestic terrorism investigations underway, and the number of cases targeting white supremacists, white nationalists, and other racially-motivated extremists has jumped in the past six months, federal law enforcement officials told the House Committee on Homeland Security on Wednesday. The head of the FBI's counterterrorism division, Assistant Director Michael McGarrity, said that about 40 percent of those investigations target subjects who adhere to racist ideologies, and "a significant majority" of them are white nationalists or white supremacists. The vast majority of the other cases involve subjects who promote anti-government or anti-authority sentiments, McGarrity testified."

Dr. Wiles, now at the University of Oxford in England, wrote in an email that the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture was "a fundamental pivot in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem." The proof also employed other key results of Dr. Shimura's research, he said."

Critique of Tor applies equally, perhaps moreso, to the whole Internet for monetization, technology, personnel, administration, operation, funding, seducing the public, NGOs, dissent. So too, to crypto, anonymization, cypherpunks.
Perennial question is how to sort through the tsunami of claims and counterclaims, sponsored hacks, slyly appealing "free" SM, search engines, FOIA enterprises, Wayback and Wikipedia, paid and volunteer informants and agents, hot shit mail lists and get-it-now podcasts, star-studded conferences and outlaw-celebrity lectures, incarcerated Julians and Jeremys, fans and evermore fans of unexamined underwriters.
Has there ever been more people eagerly declaring in public their likes and hatreds, convictions and doubts, hoping to gain advantage over other people by pretense and deception. Actually, yes, there has been since talking, singing, dancing, education, civilization was invented to entrap prey.
Prey quickly learned from predators to reverse the panopticon. Usually by offering their gullible, edible kids, cohorts and mates as irresistable bait to fatten the enemy into overconfidence, sloth, braggrdy, imagined supremacy.

Before that Tim May musings in 1994:
UNTRACEABLE MARKETS FOR ASSASSINATIONS
To make this brutally concrete, here's how escrow makes murder contracts
much safer than they are today to negotiate. Instead of one party being
caught in an FBI sting, as is so often the case when amateurs try to
arrange hits, they can use an escrow service to insulate themselves from:
1. From being traced, because the exchanges are handled via pseudonyms
2. From the killer taking the money and then not performing the hit,
because the escrow agent holds the money until the murder is verified
(according to some prototocol, such a newspaper report...again, an area for
more work, thankfully).
3. From being arrested when the money is picked up, as this is all done via
digital cash.
There are some ways to reduce the popularity of this Murder, Incorporated
system. (Things I've been thinking about for about 6 years, and which we
discussed on the list and on the Extropians list. I'll save this for
another time.)
My point here is to show how on-line clearing works in conjunction with an
escrow agent function.(Esther clears the cash, and can issue new cash to
Bob, who "trusts" her that if he does the job, the cash will clear, as
she's the escrow agent he's dealt with many times before.)
Markets for assassinations--untraceable and unlinkable--have been a
topic of discussion for a long time. You'll find them explicitly
mentioned in my 1988 "Crypto Anarchist Manifesto."

Congress has called such efforts part of 'traditional military authority.'
Iran has reportedly been a major target ­ no surprise, since General Nakasone was a key player in designing a plan called Nitro Zeus to shut down Tehran and other Iranian cities in the event of a war.

Some wizards claim leaks and leakers were invented and sustained for this purpose. Prosecutons and demonization and publicity and legislation are tools of the deceptive ops.
FOIA a particularly manipulative technique, redactions and classification markings applied for verisimilitude. So too the tiny yellow dots and other traces.
Others: Encryption and anonymizers, drop boxes, whispers to journos, aggrieved insiders and loose-lipped contractors, inspector generals, congressional briefings, sex entrapments, privacy protection NGOs, hired and coerced bots, trolls and hackers, iimplants in hardware and software, compromised communcations and internet workers and admins, lawyers, priests, psychiatrists and other supposedly confidential advisers.

WikiLeaks/Assange is primarily a source not a journalist and journalists customarily sacrifice sources to save themselves.
Assange in the early days of WikiLeaks was harshly critical of journalists and adopted the journalist cloak when journalists joined the org and shit started to come down.
WikiLeaks has sacrificed sources to save itself. But like journalists continues to claim it protects sources in order to keep leaks coming in. Also contacts authorities for approval like journalists, redacts documents, hustles for funding reportedly now in the millions of dollars, brays about its public service, avidly advertises itself, breaks laws under guise of constitutional privilege, etc.
Assanges's sexual predation like celebrities is same as that of star journalists, which stardom is hardly the norm for grunts of low-paid journalists who hate investors, publishers, editors and stars.
WikiLeaks originally promised public participation of a wiki but within months it was revealed to be an Assange promotional tool, heirarchical, high-handed, censorious, secret, cultish. Now wealthy as MSM.
WikiLeaks remains a valuable public resource but needs to shed Assange, secrecy, con artistry, obnoxious promotion by celebrity defenders out to promote themselves. It was intended to be an alternative to commercial journalism but lost its way due to Assange's misbehavior even now being glamorized, way too many vulgarians cheering his performance.
Fuck the glamorizers, free Assange from their clutches, they will abandon him when appropriate for their own protection.

FWIW, Assange's counsel mistated that Cryptome hosted, and still hosts, the State Department cables. Cryptome posted, and still hosts, the torrents for accessing the cable files after decrypting the torrents with the book-published password. But did not publish the very large files themselves.
Of the three encrypted files only one, the y-file, could be decrypted with the password, not x and z. Still don't know what is in x and z.
Cryptome archived the decrypted y file, cables.csv (1.7GB), but did not publish it.
Not aware of where or who hosted the files accessed by the torrents.
Don't know if the others who downloaded the torrents then decrypted and published all of them.
If not, it is possible WikiLeaks first published the unredacted files, maybe all of them, thinking that others had already done so.

The Tim May message came from the cpunks archives. Tim died not long ago.
The archives hold quite a bit of discussion about prosecution of Jim Bell and CJ Parker and various subpoenas disclosed and presumbably some which were not. Likely several persons were contacted directly by the prosecutors but not shared on the list. That continues.
No question cpunks  has served as a waterhole to be spied by predators. So too the whole Internet, public and private archives, anonymizers, so on.
 From the beginning there have been plants of informers, instigators, provocateurs, and kin stirring the pot. IP hosts and system administrators remain the primary sources of data, overt and covert.
Multi-level log files are ubiquitous, from identifying packets to end to end foolhardists. No way to use the Internet undetected. Programs that promise that are deceptive, Tor only one of the ploys. Privacy has been a sham from the get-go,  Comsec and infosec, crypto in particular, are porous by design, ignorance, opportunism, profit. Open source a cartoonish protective condom, adherents of it are con artists.
Cpunks like leak sites are stings, witting or unwitting. Mea culpa.
Jim Bell is a Sabu, subject to federal sanctions as ex-con if not willing to solicit supporters and unwary victims. There are thousands of them. Those most loudly anti-authority are the experts of betrayal for kings coin and to avoid going back to jail.
Cpunks archives offer much to support this critique, other archives and live action even more. Cyber security is a huge racket profiting from deliberately ineffective cybersec.

Assange will be sacrificed and discarded by journalists once no longer useful. This is a long-standing practice to assure official protection and privilege. Assange once advocated this warning but was eventully coopted by journalists who joined his team and pushed the outreach to duplicitous journalism.
Braying about threat to journalism by Assange's prosecution is a deception op conducted in cooperation with authorities. Snowden's promoters have admitted consulting with USG on what to publish, what to redact, what to withhold. Barton Gellman describes his following this CYA standard procedure in Dark Mirror.
WikiLeaks burned sources with loose security, incoherent management, Julian's vanity and opportunism, thinking he could use cohorts for his purpose without penalty. The indictment outlines the parties he enlisted, quite a few likely to have decided to cooperate, like Sabu, the "Teenager," maybe Appelbaum, others pseudonymed.
Those he has manipulated will turn against him under pressure from prosecutors against them, their families and friends. Same happened to Manning, Swartz, kirakou, Hammond, long list of others.
Snowden will eventually be handed over to USG by those he came to trust the most. Trust wears thin over time and goosed by planted suspicions and doubts, ambition, need for income. And fans are notoriously fickle, don't give a shit after the excitement wanes, smears are spread, bots and media countermesures are unleashed, rewards are offered like Greenwald's "irresistables" undergirding The And there is always the AP option for terminating JA. Treachery of supporters is too.

"D. Adverse Inference
You heard testimony from a Government witness named Michael, who the CIA placed on enforced administrative leave in August 2019. The Government only disclosed this information to the Defendant in the course of the trial. I instruct you that the Government should have disclosed the information regarding Michaels enforced administrative leave to the Defendant sooner.
In evaluating the evidence, you can decide what weight, if any, to give to the Governments conduct on this issue. You may also consider whether Michaels appearance in Court and his testimony for the Government was influenced by his being on enforced leave."
"E. Law Enforcement Officials
You have heard testimony from a number of law enforcement officials. The Governments law enforcement witnesses do not deserve any more or less consideration, or greater or lesser weight than that of any other witness."
"F. Central Intelligence Agency Witnesses
You have also heard testimony from a number of witnesses who are either currently or were previously employed by the Central Intelligence Agency, or CIA. Some of these people work directly as officers of the CIA, and some of them work as contractors performing work for the CIA.
I have allowed some of these witnesses to testify either by using a made-up name­a pseudonym­or just their first name. The disclosure of the witnesses true names and what they look like could potentially compromise their work at the CIA. Thats why those precautions were taken; but you should weigh the testimony of those witnesses just as you would any other witness, and not weigh it differently because they testified using a pseudonym or used their first name only."
"G. Bias and Hostility
In connection with your evaluation of the credibility of the witnesses, you should specifically consider evidence of resentment or anger which some Government witnesses may have toward the Defendant. Evidence that a witness is biased, prejudiced, or hostile toward the Defendant requires you to view that witness testimony with caution, to weigh it with care and subject it to close and searching scrutiny."

More on Crypto AG
[2020.03.06] One follow-on to the story of Crypto AG being owned by the CIA: this interview with a Washington Post reporter. The whole thing is worth reading or listening to, but I was struck by these two quotes at the end:
...in South America, for instance, many of the governments that were using Crypto machines were engaged in assassination campaigns. Thousands of people were being disappeared, killed. And I mean, they're using Crypto machines, which suggests that the United States intelligence had a lot of insight into what was happening. And it's hard to look back at that history now and see a lot of evidence of the United States going to any real effort to stop it or at least or even expose it.
To me, the history of the Crypto operation helps to explain how U.S. spy agencies became accustomed to, if not addicted to, global surveillance. This program went on for more than 50 years, monitoring the communications of more than 100 countries. I mean, the United States came to expect that kind of penetration, that kind of global surveillance capability. And as Crypto became less able to deliver it, the United States turned to other ways to replace that. And the Snowden documents tell us a lot about how they did that.

How many vaginas do you see a day?
About 10 a day.
Are all vaginas different?
Actually, they're mostly the same. I've only seen a handful of very different-looking ones.
How many people get their asshole waxed?
The majority. The odd one might say, 'Oh no, that doesn't bother me' but most people get it done.
What's the one thing you wish people would do before they come for a wax?
I just wish everyone prepared. Going to the toilet before they come into the room, and cleaning themselves. I go over the area with a cleanser anyway, but I think it is the client's responsibility. If you're coming from work, or whatever, then just wiping yourself down makes a big difference for me.

Trump is notorious for promoting amazingly good news and profitability, building up debt backed by public assurances, subsidies and tax avoidance, then when the paper-mache-of-contracts construction collapses, walking away hooting with banks debt is good for the economy, creates jobs, win-win-win. This is his long-time method of operation to shift profits to himself and huge debts to the public. National debt the sweetest of honey and myrrh for believers in take the money and run.
He is hardly alone in this, to be sure, national security-based econo-olitical systems, engorged by fabricated, exaggerated threats to nations ever renewed by secret reports and periodic outbursts of violence, natural or man-made, are the most common form of government and has been since the racket was invented, taught in schools and churches, bribed in clubs and parades, venerated in cemetaries and monuments and marble piles and luxurious estates.

Digital encryption is inherently faulty due to the incompatibility of physical and electromagnetic. At the electron level there might be electronic security but getting from that level to the human accessible level is insurmountable.
Encryption products fudge the linkage with smoke and mirror analogues.
"Pretty good" is one of the few crypto products which accurately describe what is possible. All the others exaggerate, exculpate for inevitable failures, prevaricate, slickly market, promise to do better with upgrades and/or new.
Lately, comsec wizards market claims that's the best we can do, live with it, agitate for privacy legislation. Or cite Snowden's racketeering, SecureDrop, Signal, and continuous snake oiling.
Full Disclosure web site covers this endless apologia pretty good.

So long as it is much more profitable to prevent and damage cybersecurity it is unlikely that any scheme for reliable and trustworthy public cybersecurity will be developed for any longer than it takes to monetize it, following a campaign to generate public trust with freeware and high recommendations of experts already deeply compromized (that's what experts means).
This has been the pattern for as long as insecurity and fear has been promoted by authoritarians, revolutionaries and "freedom fighters."
Challengers of authority inevitably betray believers for king's coin and/or other irresistable rewards. The only sec methods that publicly protect as expected are the ones never heard about, used briefly, disappear without a trace. "Never heard about," "used briefly," and "disappear without a trace" are obviously deception marketing tools. "Obviously deception marketing tools" too.

The method must be developed by a single person and used only by that person to provide public content. Not send, not receive. Just publicize, once at a time, irregularly, with different method each time. No acknowledgement.
Allowing others to partcipate opens the way to implantation of opponents, their subterfuges, their hiding among the defenses and offenses.
The solo developer/user may be corrupt and compromizable, willing or unwilling, and may use its tool to anonymously attack without retribution or traceabiity. That is quite common. However, it will be possible to eventually track the developer/user due to vanity, arrogance, self-deception, dumbness, ignorance of the near-limitless variety of tracking, seduction, baiting, keeping quiet about the trackability, as done over and other with crypto and other means of security, military grade or fools gold.
Still, there is an enduring appeal to try to beat the system, outsmart the smarties, dare to disobey and revolt. Problem is that appeal is most often promoted by authorities to smoke out their opponents, the main culprits being the professors and peddlers of crypto, comsec, infosec, cybersec, spying, susceptible to the king's coin, jealousy, vanity, pride, entrapment, compromise, bribery, imprisonment.
Self-betrayal and -delusion remain the prime threats against cybersec victory. One's own content contains the seeds of failure, its DNA detectable.
Don't give up, tilting at windmills is the generator of innovation, even if suicidal and madness. Success is the sign of serving authority.

My comment was not aimed at you, a number of folks have posted requests to enlist supporters, researchers, funders, for their projects. A few have repeated the tequests for many months, became irate and accusatory at lack of response. Might wonder if the aim is/was to grab free work, or proselitize for an ideology, overcome loneliness and isolation, front for others, or to just fuck with somebody. All these have been happening on cpunks since its earliest days. Lack of moderation allows that abuse or promise. Promises have sometimes come true. Moderation never delivers on promises, usually suppresses them as off-topic or calling them trolls..

Use of any online or digital programs and/or devices for comsec/infosec should be avoided unless completely enclosed and transmitted with non-online or non-digital means. There are a number of non-onlne and non-digital means available, the first and most reliable is your brain so long as it is not contaminated with belief in online and digital prejudice now over a century in promulgaton. The principal efforts for this promulgation is computers, coding, obfuscation, propaganda, arcanity, scientism, residual astrology, confidence gaming, spouting mantras, i.e., "cypherpunks write code."
This oh so cool mantra derives from the magicial, bewitching lodestone "national security," the abiding weapon of nations governed as royalty, heirarchical, the few overlording the many with force, elections, education, faith and trivializing deriviatives of entertainment, media, chat, parties, militants, rebels, revolutionaries, independents, intellectuals, geniuses, "democracies" ruled by  kingdoms of presidents, congresses, courts.
Nonetheless, always a nonetheless apologia for top-down regimes, far more rewarding to cooperate with authorities than to defy them, more lucrative too. So backdoors in crypto, each and every version, must be inherent code, along with outpourings of assurances there are workarounds to escape the many and be one of the few. Today, that is marketed as "smart."

Has it not been established that all key servers are compromised, that's _all_ not just some accused to divert attention from all. The compromise is not new just not well understood due to avid promotion of crypto as necessary for public and commercial privacy, infosec, comsec. CryptoAG is a noteworthy example of the deception but its confirmation too is a diversion from more deeply hidden subterfuges.
Then Tor, I2P, CJDNS, Secure Drop, Signal, et al, each eagerly boosted than gradually falling in credibility and trustworthiness to be succeeded by new borns.
It might be worth pondering Snowden's quite limited "gift to the public" as another active measure to bamboozle in the WikiLeaks manner, indeed media-born leaks as a principal tool to meddle with information and data, not that any digital method can compete with the internet itself for that role.
The recent post about crypto's failure to serve the underprivileged, citing cypherpunks as an example, is indicative of where a next step for injecting compromised sec tools is headed, following bitcoin's amazing rise as top tracker of finance under pretense of untraceability.
"Cybersecurity" is booming as education, as jobs, as investments, as must have protection and aggression initiatives. Apt that Covid shot that CyberPonzi delirium with a sneak attack on the backdoor implanters.

Appeal of pedophilia, or any sexual predation, is that it is forbidden, by custom, law, religion, belief, psychopathology.
Doesn't matter what the rationale or preventative regulation stipulates, so long as it is banned that makes the violation alluring.
If it is okay to do whatever is banned, appeal disappears. The normal is a turnoff, so its got to dressed in cosmetics, costume, behavior, edict, law, shame, risk, daring, locker room talk, braggardy, you know, the stuff marketed by the sex trade, religion, espionage, charm school, higher education, vulgarity trainers, prosecutors, lawyers, judges, wives and husbands, parents and children being prepared to be lasciviously appealing adults.
Stigmatizing porn and masturbation has just about disappeared by overflowing marketplaces and behavior sanctioning professions. The LBQT dot dot dot is expanding almost as fast as global election meddling and lurid entertainment, all lagging and emulating official and commercial and religious spying and reporting upsetting information.
War slaughter is the top sexual predation, every human a potential actor and victim. Once addicted to massive bloodletting not much can compete, although masturbation througn simulations in carnage-rich games is racing to outdo the unpleasantly real. Shortly games wizards will drive the actual standoff homicides. To be sure, games wizards do not expect to be beaten to pulp by more capable punks.
