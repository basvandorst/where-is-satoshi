Lol.  What a libertarian.
Sounds more like a tyrannical king.
Gibs me 1/1000 nights with your wife.

I point out contradiction in your "tax" system.
Then give metaphor.
Do you want a fucking powerpoint?
Yes it is.
Freedom is a "state" that costs nothing.
It requires no input.
You are thinking of the expression of certain freedoms.
I am correct to assert that your double standard with "taxes" is
unacceptable.  Your pursuit of "wealth" is okay.
We've never tried 'REAL' Gommunism, anyway.
I think the problem is with your definition of "State".
[Begin Quote]
1175-1225; Middle English 'stat' (noun);
Aphetic variant of 'estat' (estate);
Latin 'status' (condition) see status;
Latin 'status' (rērum), state (of things);
Latin 'status' (reī pūblicae), state (of the republic);
Old French 'estat', from Latin 'status' (a standing), from 'stāre' (to
early 13c., "circumstances, temporary attributes of a person or thing,
conditions", from Latin 'status' "manner of standing, position, condition".
late 13c., the Latin word was adopted into other modern Germanic
languages (e.g. German, Dutch 'staat') but in the political senses only.
Meaning "physical condition as regards to form or structure".
1590s, "to set in a position," from state (n.1); the sense of "declare
in words" is first attested 1640s, from the notion of "placing"
something on the record.

By denying the "State" (political definition), you seem to be objecting
to groups and group activities, such as agreeing to work together, in a
shared "state" (all definitions).
Yet /asspol/ implements a group activity to "kill" individuals who do
not act in accordance with the interests of the group, for profit.
Your fifth column option, AP, is a "State" (political definition) in the
very worst sense.  I see now that 'Libertarian' is not the objection to
both democratic and totalitarian systems but is the combination of the
two; the perception of freedom; Marxist Gommunism at its finest.

You "cheekily" suggested a finder fee for increasing the "value" of
"coin" properties.  Finder "fees" are a "tax".
Both are the redistribution of "wealth", e.g., the same.
Only the context changes.
Mandatory and optional "taxes" or "exchanges of value for service" are
the same kind of payment within a different context.
You can disguise coerced payments as "donations" all you want, it
doesn't change the truth.
The open-source/libre communities have been doing this for decades.
And the church, even longer.
This is very violent.  Cypherpunks is a board of peace.
You should fork your work to my 'Archive Politics', project.
I think you said it breddu gud:
Freedom is free. Getting to a condition of freedom, however, is not the
same thing as being free. We have to do things to become free.""

I did above.  Finders "fee" for crypto.
I do not object to your pursuit of wealth, via direct donation, to pay
for your time in developing a new system of political governance.
I snip out the bulk and keep what is heard.
Your actual quote is archived in the previous thread post, I am only
Don't you use HTML email ?
It is difficult to read when you do that.
Your words are often not separated from the content you quote.  But this
is an unmoderated list =)
Nope.  Just posting what I hear, to establish a reference for my words.
What you write, "in my own words", for aiding accuracy.  It enables
(you) to make edits to initial statements or "signals" as received by (me).
"Just one murder away from utopia" is a Gommunist critique and parallels
my observation of your AP system.
You cannot ignore the agreed meaning of words you use without offering
alternative meanings.
Unless you define 'state'/'State' different than 'state' (state of
something) or 'State' (Antarctic State), you are subject to the logic of
my argument which asserts that a "State" is an individual and/or
collective status of beliefes and agreements protected only by the
individual and/or collective ability to defend the status of these
beliefs and agreements.
Voided oaths do not apply.
Not an excuse because it is not true.  Americans must reaffirm their
"constitution" every generation.
"The Group" in this context is the greater commongood, as you seem to
assert that "bad politicians" will be targets of this system and
"benefit" the greater populace.
"The Group" in this context is those who participate in the AP system as
you propose, mostly those with the greatest resources.
In both examples, "The Group" becomes a tyranny of the few, and Marina's
observations follow.
Govern: to regulate or direct.
AP is a system of government.
Do you dispute this ?
Democracy: People should have a say.
Totalitarianism: Do as I/We say at threat of death.
Libertarianism (Socialism/Communism): People should have a say, at
threat of death.
It is the mere perception of freedom, as exemplified in Plato's Republic
when discussing the "just" lie.
The "freedom" of an individual to pay into an AP system is removed by
the "freedom" of another to "kill" them for doing so, enslaving all
participants, and (since proofs are difficult if not impossible to
recover given you suggest public cryptography) all suspects, to group
controlled behaviors.

You retard.
I connected the etymology of 'state' and 'State'.
Then connected Jim's AP to a 'State' (Government).
Jim is a Statist.
What don't you get ?
