Sweet!  I was just fudging Alpine to be Tails-like but this is less work for me!!!
What do you mean by "workflow"?
Some thoughts/questions:
+ dd to USB stick was smooth.
+ Boot log being visible provides system boot status, which is nice.
+ Why is there a login of 'luther'?
+ User specified administrative account passphrase, and option to have no account at all.
+ Heads provided passphrase did not grant root.  sudo fails.
+ Mate did not load.  I guessed at 'startmate'.
I have more thoughts but I will keep playing with it.  Thanks!
