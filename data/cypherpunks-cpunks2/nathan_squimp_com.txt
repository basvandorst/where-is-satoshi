The argument from the administration, NSA or any other channel holds
no water.
Quiet simply if the NSA thinks responsible disclosure is the way to go
where are the 0days they have disclosed?

We(*) are putting together a theater show/installation for Festspiele
Zürich at the Gessnerallee theater called Anonymous-P. It's a show
between us and the cell phones of the audience. Something between
Defcons "Wall-of-Sheep" on steroids as well as a game we developed for
profiling between audience members. Over top of it all are 3 actors
dealing with the topics of privacy and digital fingerprinting in their
own way.
It's either going to be epic or a complete disaster. Test runs have
proven interesting. It is strange when an actor pulls you aside to help
you change your phone so you stop leaking passwords (which 1 in 10
people do). Or when your interaction with the game has made the
conclusion that you are most likely to lie. Or when you have to pay the
higher price for a beer that's listed between 2 to 7chf just because the
barman thinks you are rich (you have an iPhone or data game determined
you make over 5000chf).
Come see it if you get a chance or know someone interested.

spending are the scourge of humanity. The bureaucratic response to
crisies, big and small, costs lives. Actually, the car is probably the
greatest affront to public safety there ever was.

A little bit of encryption in the water saves more
Isn't the chicken and egg of humanity fun. Put in a little crypto,
people die, pull out a little crypto, people die. Whether they look at
only the chicken or only the egg seems to depend ot the objective to
retain the status quo because anything else is scary, to them.
now, where can i find some crypto water
problem is, governmental terror costs way more. And even with a good
government (never happened, won't happen without a good amount of
Change) the loss of liberty is a damage paid cheaply with children's lives.
believable statistics about the amount of deaths there's no argument at
all. A cheaper seatbelt costs lives. Not putting lithium in the water
costs lives. Influenza, and a lack of smart and organized medical
spending are the scourge of humanity. The bureaucratic response to
crisies, big and small, costs lives. Actually, the car is probably the
greatest affront to public safety there ever was.

@_subject: What is offtopic and what should be avoided on this list? 
Hash: SHA1
I am not authoritative here but I can say how I consume this list.
It's different from any other list I know. Consumption is more similar
to IRC. There is no real structure and many write under pseudonyms. I
don't think you can have a serious discussion of topics that hover
around anonymity without accepting the cruft that comes with anonymous
contributions. Some people use these "qualities" in this environment
and simply masturbate intellectually with. On IRC one develops a way
to find interesting comments in-between this noise. And over time one
develops interesting mental reflexes and intuitions from these space.
This might seem like a description for "how to survive the cypherpunk
mailinglist" but these reflexes, once developed, then apply in very
interesting ways in other areas of society. One example is the
application of anonymous behavior and hierarchies to political
science. That is, the role of non-branded ideology and action in politics.
or to put simply
in some ways the cypherpunks mailing list is 4chan via smtp.
thus far I dont think you would find yourself getting banned. though
some may just add a mute filter for you if you spam.

a lecture performance with a character that believes in absolute

with a dash of male psychology and neurophilia for inspiration. This
weekend at Hebbel Am Ufer in berlin, if interested (nov 21,22).

@_subject: Method FBI used to crack iPhone likely effects recent phones 
tldr; NAND proxy to prevent wipe. Instigate fake phantom wipe to reset counter+delay for passcode attempts.
This was published only a few days before the news that the FBI cracked the iPhone. So it is highly unlikely that the information disclosed was used by their hackers. But based on recent information the attack described in that post, in my obviously biased opinion, seems increasingly probable.
Also so far I found nothing in the iOS Security documentation that indicates this attack will NOT work on most recent iPhones. Though it could be that I simply missed an important detail.

What killed this list is not the anti-westernism (even more of that
would be fine) it is the users that refuse to get their own twitter
account and instead of post every link they read and every grumpy
thought they have on cpunks instead. It is a good recipe for destroying
any technocratic utopia that resists moderation or regulation: just fill
it with trash.
