@_subject: Password creation with Argon2 
Hi dear cypherpunks,
as a little learning exercise I created a small GUI based Golang program,
which allows users to create strong passwords with the help of Argon2id.
Hope you like the idea!
Merry Christmas

I know ... :-D Seriously, was it ever brought up here on the ML if
Bitcoin collider
software, run on a cheap VPS for example, would be more interesting to
run compared
to ASIC miners, which probably produce only 'dust' nowadays due to the
high difficulty
and are not environment friendly due to high energy consumption?

I also read recently that pretty high BTC funds 'changed' it's owner.
Well, my thoughts are (I remember the old Usenet days when cypherpunks
used all their real names) if I would start to use now a pseudonym 3rd parties,
trained in that area, could easily identify me with the help of software, when
collecting threads from various places where cypherpunks, activists etc.
post on public places. And in case I would start now (here) under another
identity it would be super hard for me to write under a second persona.
But in general you are right, people should do that and public places like
Mailing Lists should also support injecting messages, via whitelisted
anonymous Remailers.

Sorry, I don't know. I only read about it a while ago that such projects exists
in the EU and that in the United States, for example, companies exists
who train law enforcement etc. in such areas.
If you Google for Mixmaster Remailer it should show some results and
to find out about it's successor YAMN you may check out GitHub.
Mixmaster4096 can be found on GitHub too.
Mixmaster (the old version) was also part of Linux distributions, but
recently Debian removed it, IIRC.

I run also two YAMN exit Remailers for a long time, but had to
shut them down, due to policy changes of the VPS provider.
Here are additional infos about YAMN:
and the currently available pinger services, which you need
one from, in order to update stats and pub keys:

Why confused? What I described in my OP on the GnuPG ML should
be possible today or in the future, even if chances are super minimal. I
mean what does Bitcoin Collider Software, like LBC, Brainflayer etc.
does? The 256bit HEX values people are looking for, as understood,
need also be in a valid range, according to Bitcoin specs.
An example collision could look like this if you examine this GnuPG
signature (which has a secret Bitcoin key with a positive balance:
(seen in a Usenet posting)
Regarding research (and GnuPG) people could write for example
a program which checks a complete publicity available key server
dump for signature packets  i.e the once that are only 256bit long
and then convert them, keep them in a text file and use a balance checker
program ...

Hi all,
I recently finished the English word list for my encoder/decoder and thought
I would share the program with you.
The software allows users with an offline computer and pencil and paper only
to use their favorite encryption software and then encode /decode small binary
blobs error free*, compared to other solutions IMHO.
I must admit that this procedure is a bit time consuming but it should give
users at least one more option in their tool set.
*I received today an encrypted postcard in QR-code but was not able to
decode the message, even with high dpi scan settings.

Thanks for your feedback, much appreciated!
I am aware of the well known pgp-wordlist, however like you state when
using audio channels the pgp-wordlist may not be the best option for
non-native (US) English speakers, because it contains many words which
probably a lot of non-native speakers are not familiar with and have
then difficulties to write the words down. Then there is mnemonicodes
available, but the list in there
contains to many words, while it is more efficient when encoding.
Hence my humble approach.

You're welcome!
Thanks for the info, will try out tomorrow.
