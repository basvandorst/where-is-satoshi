In a city (LA) where burglars will break into your home for a mere $400
flat panel TV, the journalist involved has just painted a bullseye on
this 64 year old man's back, due to the supposed 1,000,000 bitcoins he
has.  This is a disaster waiting to happen.. I can't believe Newsweek
actually published his photo, along with his house and car with visible
license plate
