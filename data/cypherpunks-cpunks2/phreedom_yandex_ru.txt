Can you name a specific attack which actually happened, and which involved altering an ad url in any way or posting a fake physical ad? Are we talking about something that actually exists? It's not like an ad by microsoft can't point to a legitimately-looking domain name which isn't microsoft.com eg I understand also that:
 * these benefits exist for maybe top 100 domains
 * it's usual for well-known entities to use campaign-specific domain names
 * even if you know the entity name to be $NAME, the domain can still be $NAME.com, $NAME.org, $NAME-project.org, get$NAME.com etc
The "security" of physical ads is pretty much about the cost/benefit, and that's why we don't see such attacks in the first place.
There are gateways like tor2web.org and onion.to, and these can be encoded into the QR code for compatibility purposes since there's 1:1 mapping beween darknet and gateway urls.
For all practical purposes, the DNS replacement is already available in the form of tor hidden services, tested and known to be quite reliable.
The status-quo is:
1) you pay money to get a DNS record which:
   a) can be revoked at will by a number of entities
   b) requires you to identify yourself, unless you're willing to play spy games(and noone know for how much longer the loopholes will exist, see (a))
   c) requires you to be able to pay, which may exclude "children" who can't get the bank account/card, residents of sanctioned countries.
2) you get a ssl cert, with MITM-by-advanced-adversary as an inherent "security feature". This also may come with random and potentially ridiculous hops to jump thru, the list is subject to change
3) wait for hours/days for payments to complete and records to propagate.
Tor hidden service:
 1) add 2 lines to torrc, or use vidalia to do the same
 2) grab the service address from tor's dir
 3) the service goes online in 5-10 minutes, with encryption and authentication always on.
HTTP gateway is available for legacy platforms.
Bookmarking and address book features are widely available thus making the appearance of the url itself not that important.
Both client and service can opt to drop their half of the circuit, which turns it into a more or less direct tcp connection, with nat traversal capabilities. Yes there are caveats, yes tor devs are spending their effort on making tor hide users, rather than optimizing "we don't want no anonymity" use cases, but the foundation is solid.
The only known issue that bothers me is that tor doesn't let you keep the root keys for the service offline. A 2-level setup would be really nice, tor devs. pretty please?
For all I care, the solution has been available for several years.
It works well, but I'm afraid that getting it adopted would require the current gatekeepers to step up abuses by a couple orders of magnitude.
