Actually, the nine servers are not operated by Chaum.  They're operated by "highly skilled people in this room who know how to build and run a secure data center".
At least that's what he said at the talk I witnessed where he unveiled it.
Additionally, Chaum's design allows an entity operating one of the servers to introduce their own policy - "it's not up to me what policy you want to introduce; the system is neutral".
So, first of all there's Chaum's obvious failure to recognize that in the same room are the exact people who could hack into a "secure data center".
Second, he implied that, with the use of these policies, if a message were to traverse a network with nodes operated by the US, Canada, Egypt, India, Pakistan, Iran, Russia, China and Japan, it would require the admins from those countries to all agree to decrypt, turning the solution into a political - not mathematical - one.
Now, I'm personally hardly a supporter of the idea, and hate the fact that Chaum's idea lends credibility to Comey's "smart people just need to work on it" position.  In fact, I consider any sort of backdoored system tantamount to treason to cryptography, and antithetical to its But I do think it's important to debate on the actual facts at hand.

Point is the technology is neutral/agnostic to its location and operator - and that a key part of the solution is in fact political.
Hell, I'm still wondering who would use such a system in the first place without the imposition of regulation?

Sounds like we're in agreement then that crypto systems with political solutions aren't actually crypto solutions at all then?
Anyone else (dis)agree?
