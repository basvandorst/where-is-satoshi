@_subject: Security/Privacy Tradeoff - Dave DeWalt of Mandiant 
I will simply say that most people making speeches about privacy these
days don't actually understand what privacy is or why it's important.

It's also worth noting that they are using Cloudflare. Has Cloudflare
made any statements about whether they log traffic and/or hand over
data to governments?

In my case, it's available upon request, or to anyone who gets an email from me.
And before you ask, no, I will not sign your public key, at least not on a
public keyserver. Here is one of the reasons why:

@_subject: Wikileaks says Wednesday is the End for Hillary. 
I'll preface by saying I hate both candidates, and support neither. However, if
there is something in the public interest, they should publish it, regardless of
timing. I'm reminded of the NSA wiretap story that was delayed due to the 2004
election, and would possibly have influenced the outcome.
So if Wikileaks has something on Clinton, they should release it. By the same
token, if someone comes into possession of Trump's tax returns, that information
should *also* be released. I'm a little confused as to why Wikileaks hasn't
asked for this (that I've seen), but perhaps the next few weeks will surprise
