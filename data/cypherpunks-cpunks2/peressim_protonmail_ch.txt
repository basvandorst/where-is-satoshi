@_subject: "Too much netflix and youtube syndrome" affecting 'Merican 
My neice now at age of 10 years old, spend hours on youtube, and I am not concerned if she is catching bugs, or figuring out that the internet is slow, but instead I am concerned that the evil the techonology is making to happen to our children, besides the evil that it is also doing to us. Technology must be avoided as much as we can. The trully malware is not affecting our computers, but our minds.

A friend of mine about her four year old:
"My daughter was doing a little song and dance this morning and was
really boogieing down. She paused for a second and said,"I'm buffering"

My advice is: Do not use social networks!
