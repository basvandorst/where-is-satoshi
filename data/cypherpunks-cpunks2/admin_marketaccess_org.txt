About this Conference
After multiple agency exposures to identity theft, in May 2006 President
Bush created the Identity Theft Task Force to develop a comprehensive
strategic plan for steps that the federal government could take to combat
identity theft and provide recommended actions that could be taken by the
public and private sectors. In April 2007 the task force submitted its plan
to combat identity theft to the President. As a response to the plan, on
May 22, 2007 the OMB released M-07-16, which requires federal agencies to
develop and implement breach and notification policies within 120 days.
M-07-16 requires that federal agencies develop notification policies that:
Review existing requirements with respect to privacy and security
Include existing and new requirements for incident and handling
Include existing and new requirements for external breach notification
Develop policies that concern the responsibilities of individuals
authorized to access personally identifiable information
With the agencies required to develop and implement policies and procedures
in such a short period of time, the Strategies for Data Breach Prevention,
Mitigation and Notification Briefing is designed to break down the
requirements of M-07-16 and provide guidance and suggestions for agencies
in developing policies and plans. You will be given a complete overview of
the mandate and learn tactics and solutions available to develop policies
in cost-effective ways that fulfill the requirements of the mandate and
strengthen agencies' information systems and data.
