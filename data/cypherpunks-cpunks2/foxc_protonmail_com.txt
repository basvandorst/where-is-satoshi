Hi Everyone,
I'm new to the list and to encryption generally. I don't consider myself a good programmer but I needed to learn a little about gpg for work and I'm increasingly curious about it. I had two ideas for things I could build but I want to know if they've already been done/whether they're bad ideas:
1) Cloud storage.
I think it would be relatively easy to write a program where any file I save in folder X automatically gets encrypted and saved to folder Y Box/Dropbox/etc. Any new files saved in Y which my key can open get opened and put in folder X. Since the private key password would be saved for this to work automatically, it would be worthless if someone got on my machine, but if one of the cloud providers gets compromised, all they would have is a collection of encrypted files.
2) re-mailer usability
An Outlook (sorry) macro (sorry again) to save outgoing mail as .msg file. Python script monitors folder were the .msg would appear, encrypts the msg, composes and sends new blank message with the old message as an encrypted attachment and the proper forwarding instructions.
I'm not an anarchist, please forgive me.

I agree Windows would be the weak link, but I think it is easier to persuade someone to install an add-in than to learn Linux.

I must be on the wrong list then, i am not Christian, conservative or pro any nation :D
obviously elle-twat wants to derail your sensible questions.
If your encryption is sufficiently strong (ppl seem happy with AES256, any better suggestions) and your random number generator wasn't designed or influenced by the NSA then you're likely to keep your information private.
Note that you will then become the weak link and if the information is sufficiently important then it will get painful :)
In terms of a Windows (you said Outlook) based remailer then I'd see Windows as the weak link, especially if its v7/8 or 10.
