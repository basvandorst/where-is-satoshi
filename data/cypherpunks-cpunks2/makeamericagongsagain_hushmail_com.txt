Lol the vape plebs.  Faggots think red-hot steel dabs is better than
smoking a "joint" and that vaped oil is not smoke.
The "muh candy and cookies" edible tards are just as bad, especially
the (((vegans))), thinking sugar is "good" and saturated fat is "bad".
And none of these fucks care about the growing and extraction
processes that undermine the plant's "medicinal" value.

Gross generalization.  None of pro-cannabis studies use logic as
argument, only (((controled))) experimentation.  Thanks for solid reasoning.  Except it is not false.  Maybe you are

Where the fukc have you been ?  This is a soylent-only list, fucker. Take your whole-food kale shakes elsewhere, lol =)
It must be the tryptophan biosynthesising all that serotonin in the
brain, huh.  You're not trying to push that shitty china study, or
worse, the vegan agenda, are you ?
