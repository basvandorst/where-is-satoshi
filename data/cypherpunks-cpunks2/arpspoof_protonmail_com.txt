-------- Original Message --------
Digging around, it looks like this is the post that lead to him being added to that list - It's quite long, and self-indulgent at times, but worth a read. I can see how some would object to it though, a letter saying "If you're white, you're racist, even if you've never been racist, check your privilege" is something that's just not going to go down well.
You may have never used the N-word in your life, you may hate the K.K.K., but that does not mean that you don’t harbor racism and benefit from racism.
Not sure I agree with the whole idea of the professor watchlist, but I'm not entirely surprised he landed on it. But, good for him in continuing to stand and speak up for what he believes.
Those familiar with George Orwell's "1984" will recall that "Newspeak was designed not to extend but to diminish the range of thought." I recently felt the weight of this Orwellian ethos when many of my students sent emails to inform me, and perhaps warn me, that my name appears on the Professor Watchlist, a new website created by a conservative youth group known as Turning Point USA.
I could sense the gravity in those email messages, a sense of relaying what is to come. The Professor Watchlist's mission, among other things, is to sound an alarm about those of us within academia who "advance leftist propaganda in the classroom." It names and includes photographs of some 200 professors.
The Watchlist appears to be consistent with a nostalgic desire "to make America great again" and to expose and oppose those voices in academia that are anti-Republican or express anti-Republican values. For many black people, making America "great again" is especially threatening, as it signals a return to a more explicit and unapologetic racial dystopia. For us, dreaming of yesterday is not a privilege, not a desire, but a nightmare.
The new "watchlist" is essentially a new species of McCarthyism, especially in terms of its overtones of "disloyalty" to the American republic. And it is reminiscent of Cointelpro, the secret F.B.I. program that spied on, infiltrated and discredited American political organizations in the '50s and '60s. Its goal of "outing" professors for their views helps to create the appearance of something secretly subversive. It is a form of exposure designed to mark, shame and silence.
So, in my classrooms, I refuse to remain silent in the face of racism, its subtle and systemic structure. I refuse to remain silent in the face of patriarchal and sexist hegemony and the denigration of women's bodies, or about the ways in which women have internalized male assumptions of how they should look and what they should feel and desire.
I refuse to be silent about forms of militarism in which innocent civilians are murdered in the name of "democracy." I refuse to remain silent when it comes to acknowledging the existential and psychic dread and chaos experienced by those who are targets of xenophobia and homophobia.
I refuse to remain silent when it comes to transgender women and men who are beaten to death by those who refuse to create conditions of hospitality.
I refuse to remain silent in a world where children become targets of sexual violence, and where unarmed black bodies are shot dead by the state and its proxies, where those with disabilities are mocked and still rendered "<  rous," and where the earth suffers because some of us refuse to hear its suffering, where my ideas are marked as "un-American," and apparently "dangerous."
Well, if it is dangerous to teach my students to love their neighbors, to think and rethink constructively and ethically about who their neighbors are, and how they have been taught to see themselves as disconnected and neoliberal subjects, then, yes, I am dangerous, and what I teach is dangerous.

This is a good thing - war on terror here we come
-------- Original Message --------
That old line again. We know there are some serious concerns about this, and we know you're right and can't begin to formulate an argument against, but we really want these powers, so trust us it's for the greater good.
It's a bit like how the UK Investigatory Powers Act contains many, many "safeguards". All of which are just promises not to misuse the data.
Politicians never seem to get the argument that even if they are trustworthy, there's nothing to say the next bloke isn't going to be a nutjob.
The post it refers to is here -  - it places a lot of focus on various things they want to use it to stop, using the aged tactic of dropping some emotive crimes in there so that it's hard for people to disagree.
Looking at the text though - (6) a magistrate judge with authority in any district where activities related to a crime may have occurred has authority to issue a warrant to use remote access to search electronic storage media and to seize or copy electronically stored information located within or outside that district if:
(A) the district where the media or information is located has been concealed through technological means; or
(B) in an investigation of a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5), the media are protected computers that have been damaged without authorization and are located in five or more districts.
There doesn't seem to be any restriction on what it can be used for, only that it fall under criminal law (and the things that fall under that tend to change over time). No reason they couldn't apply that to "criminal copyright infringement" for example.
I do wonder how the American exceptionalists are going to cope when other countries pass similar legislation and starting popping American systems in greater numbers ("Well, it's legal under our laws"). Mind you, not like they haven't been getting extra-territorial for quite some time anyway.
In both this and the UK IPA, it seems to be a case of legalising behaviour that's been going on for a long time anyway, rather than actually stepping back and looking at whether that behaviour is actually right (legal or not).
Bad times ahead me thinks.
FBI to gain expanded hacking powers as Senate effort to block fails
"[...] allow U.S. judges will be able to issue search warrants that give the FBI the authority to remotely access computers in any jurisdiction, potentially even overseas."
"[...] in the hands of an administration of President-elect Trump, a Republican who has "openly said he wants the power to hack his political opponents the same way Russia does."
We are discussing the bad possibilities in some legal and technical studies groups in my country. Our laws don't permiss this kind of violation. Fu¢k FBI.

The bugzilla bug tracking this is phunny:
First, the extended commit message has "MozReview-Commit-ID: 9 feedbacker at example.com" on its last line. That looks like a mistake? MozReview-Commit-ID is supposed to contain a longer UUID (longer than "9" :))
Yeah, the weird commit message is because Emacs dies while I was editing it while uploading, so there was some extra meta data in there. Sorry about that. I'll fix up the AutoRestore stuff, I was just being lazy.
Yeah -- a crash is still expected, even in a "good" build with the fix. The difference is whether the crash is safe or not. (Per beginning of comment 13, we'd like to avoid crashing at all, but it's simpler to just abort safely in the error condition for now.)
To validate the fix, you should load the interactive testcase and trigger the crash, and then go ahead and submit the crash and check the crash signature. A "bad" crash looks like this:
A "good" crash will look a bit different -- it should at least have a "crash address" of 0x0 or close to that, I think. I'm not sure exactly how it'll look because I don't have a expected-"good" build handy. Do you have a link to the build that you're testing?
Hi Daniel,
I just tested it on Windows 10 pro (x64). The crash address is "0x7ff9fb1c05c0". I am not sure if we expected that. Thanks.
Thanks, Cynthia. I believe the presence of "MOZ_RELEASE_ASSERT" in that crash report means all is well. (Additionally, the backtrace confirms that we're crashing on that new assertion line in AddMilestone, which is just before we set ourselves up for trouble.)
I guess MOZ_RELEASE_ASSERT produces a non-null crash address on Windows for some reason; not sure why. But I think that crash report is still fine -- MOZ_RELEASE_ASSERT should be all that we need to look for here.

Interesting story tho..
Apparently this had been going on for a couple of years...
"The criminals were able to send banner ads and javascript to their targets' computers by pushing both into ad networks. These networks aggressively scan advertisers' javascript for suspicious code, so the criminals needed to sneak their bad code past these checks.  To do this, they made tiny alterations to the transparency values of the individual pixels of the accompanying banner ads, which were in the PNG format, which allows for pixel-level gradations in transparency. The javascript sent by the attackers would run through the pixels in the banners, looking for ones with the telltale alterations, then it would turn that tweaked transparency value into a character. By stringing all these characters together, the javascript would assemble a new program, which it would then execute on the target's computer.   This new program triggered a network request to a site controlled by the attackers, which repeatedly checked the target's computer to see if it was running inside a virtual machine (a telltale sign of a paranoid user, possibly a security researcher who would figure out what was going on) or whether it had any anti-virus software. Once it was satisfied that the target was not in a position to detect active attacks, it launched exploits targeted at Internet Explorer/Flash to hijack the machine and gather the user's keystrokes, with a special emphasis on bank-industry information."

a) He is off-topic.
b) He doesn't make coherent, logical arguments.
c) He makes noise to imply that he enjoys your pain.
d) He has confessed that he is really a 10 year old boy who hasn't found
out how to masturbate to relieve his tension.
Why not do what the wise people say and "don't feed the trolls" (this

not reply if he tortures cats. Do not reply even if he misspells your

-------- Original Message --------
Digging around, it looks like this is the post that lead to him being added to that list - It's quite long, and self-indulgent at times, but worth a read. I can see how some would object to it though, a letter saying "If you're white, you're racist, even if you've never been racist, check your privilege" is something that's just not going to go down well.
You may have never used the N-word in your life, you may hate the K.K.K., but that does not mean that you don’t harbor racism and benefit from racism.
Not sure I agree with the whole idea of the professor watchlist, but I'm not entirely surprised he landed on it. But, good for him in continuing to stand and speak up for what he believes.
Those familiar with George Orwell's "1984" will recall that "Newspeak was designed not to extend but to diminish the range of thought." I recently felt the weight of this Orwellian ethos when many of my students sent emails to inform me, and perhaps warn me, that my name appears on the Professor Watchlist, a new website created by a conservative youth group known as Turning Point USA.
I could sense the gravity in those email messages, a sense of relaying what is to come. The Professor Watchlist's mission, among other things, is to sound an alarm about those of us within academia who "advance leftist propaganda in the classroom." It names and includes photographs of some 200 professors.
The Watchlist appears to be consistent with a nostalgic desire "to make America great again" and to expose and oppose those voices in academia that are anti-Republican or express anti-Republican values. For many black people, making America "great again" is especially threatening, as it signals a return to a more explicit and unapologetic racial dystopia. For us, dreaming of yesterday is not a privilege, not a desire, but a nightmare.
The new "watchlist" is essentially a new species of McCarthyism, especially in terms of its overtones of "disloyalty" to the American republic. And it is reminiscent of Cointelpro, the secret F.B.I. program that spied on, infiltrated and discredited American political organizations in the '50s and '60s. Its goal of "outing" professors for their views helps to create the appearance of something secretly subversive. It is a form of exposure designed to mark, shame and silence.
So, in my classrooms, I refuse to remain silent in the face of racism, its subtle and systemic structure. I refuse to remain silent in the face of patriarchal and sexist hegemony and the denigration of women's bodies, or about the ways in which women have internalized male assumptions of how they should look and what they should feel and desire.
I refuse to be silent about forms of militarism in which innocent civilians are murdered in the name of "democracy." I refuse to remain silent when it comes to acknowledging the existential and psychic dread and chaos experienced by those who are targets of xenophobia and homophobia.
I refuse to remain silent when it comes to transgender women and men who are beaten to death by those who refuse to create conditions of hospitality.
I refuse to remain silent in a world where children become targets of sexual violence, and where unarmed black bodies are shot dead by the state and its proxies, where those with disabilities are mocked and still rendered "<  rous," and where the earth suffers because some of us refuse to hear its suffering, where my ideas are marked as "un-American," and apparently "dangerous."
Well, if it is dangerous to teach my students to love their neighbors, to think and rethink constructively and ethically about who their neighbors are, and how they have been taught to see themselves as disconnected and neoliberal subjects, then, yes, I am dangerous, and what I teach is dangerous.

-------- Original Message --------
That old line again. We know there are some serious concerns about this, and we know you're right and can't begin to formulate an argument against, but we really want these powers, so trust us it's for the greater good.
It's a bit like how the UK Investigatory Powers Act contains many, many "safeguards". All of which are just promises not to misuse the data.
Politicians never seem to get the argument that even if they are trustworthy, there's nothing to say the next bloke isn't going to be a nutjob.
The post it refers to is here -  - it places a lot of focus on various things they want to use it to stop, using the aged tactic of dropping some emotive crimes in there so that it's hard for people to disagree.
Looking at the text though - (6) a magistrate judge with authority in any district where activities related to a crime may have occurred has authority to issue a warrant to use remote access to search electronic storage media and to seize or copy electronically stored information located within or outside that district if:
(A) the district where the media or information is located has been concealed through technological means; or
(B) in an investigation of a violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1030(a)(5), the media are protected computers that have been damaged without authorization and are located in five or more districts.
There doesn't seem to be any restriction on what it can be used for, only that it fall under criminal law (and the things that fall under that tend to change over time). No reason they couldn't apply that to "criminal copyright infringement" for example.
I do wonder how the American exceptionalists are going to cope when other countries pass similar legislation and starting popping American systems in greater numbers ("Well, it's legal under our laws"). Mind you, not like they haven't been getting extra-territorial for quite some time anyway.
In both this and the UK IPA, it seems to be a case of legalising behaviour that's been going on for a long time anyway, rather than actually stepping back and looking at whether that behaviour is actually right (legal or not).
Bad times ahead me thinks.
FBI to gain expanded hacking powers as Senate effort to block fails
"[...] allow U.S. judges will be able to issue search warrants that give the FBI the authority to remotely access computers in any jurisdiction, potentially even overseas."
"[...] in the hands of an administration of President-elect Trump, a Republican who has "openly said he wants the power to hack his political opponents the same way Russia does."
We are discussing the bad possibilities in some legal and technical studies groups in my country. Our laws don't permiss this kind of violation. Fu¢k FBI.

This is just a weaponized named example of "multiple memory safety bugz",

The bugzilla bug tracking this is phunny:
First, the extended commit message has "MozReview-Commit-ID: 9 feedbacker at example.com" on its last line. That looks like a mistake? MozReview-Commit-ID is supposed to contain a longer UUID (longer than "9" :))
Yeah, the weird commit message is because Emacs dies while I was editing it while uploading, so there was some extra meta data in there. Sorry about that. I'll fix up the AutoRestore stuff, I was just being lazy.
Yeah -- a crash is still expected, even in a "good" build with the fix. The difference is whether the crash is safe or not. (Per beginning of comment 13, we'd like to avoid crashing at all, but it's simpler to just abort safely in the error condition for now.)
To validate the fix, you should load the interactive testcase and trigger the crash, and then go ahead and submit the crash and check the crash signature. A "bad" crash looks like this:
A "good" crash will look a bit different -- it should at least have a "crash address" of 0x0 or close to that, I think. I'm not sure exactly how it'll look because I don't have a expected-"good" build handy. Do you have a link to the build that you're testing?
Hi Daniel,
I just tested it on Windows 10 pro (x64). The crash address is "0x7ff9fb1c05c0". I am not sure if we expected that. Thanks.
Thanks, Cynthia. I believe the presence of "MOZ_RELEASE_ASSERT" in that crash report means all is well. (Additionally, the backtrace confirms that we're crashing on that new assertion line in AddMilestone, which is just before we set ourselves up for trouble.)
I guess MOZ_RELEASE_ASSERT produces a non-null crash address on Windows for some reason; not sure why. But I think that crash report is still fine -- MOZ_RELEASE_ASSERT should be all that we need to look for here.

Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema

Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under

You're an utter fool if you don't, at the bare minimum, run a fucking adblocker plugin.
ABP exists for Firefox, chrome, Safari and as a dedicated browser for android...
Interesting story tho..
Apparently this had been going on for a couple of years...
"The criminals were able to send banner ads and javascript to their targets' computers by pushing both into ad networks. These networks aggressively scan advertisers' javascript for suspicious code, so the criminals needed to sneak their bad code past these checks.  To do this, they made tiny alterations to the transparency values of the individual pixels of the accompanying banner ads, which were in the PNG format, which allows for pixel-level gradations in transparency. The javascript sent by the attackers would run through the pixels in the banners, looking for ones with the telltale alterations, then it would turn that tweaked transparency value into a character. By stringing all these characters together, the javascript would assemble a new program, which it would then execute on the target's computer.   This new program triggered a network request to a site controlled by the attackers, which repeatedly checked the target's computer to see if it was running inside a virtual machine (a telltale sign of a paranoid user, possibly a security researcher who would figure out what was going on) or whether it had any anti-virus software. Once it was satisfied that the target was not in a position to detect active attacks, it launched exploits targeted at Internet Explorer/Flash to hijack the machine and gather the user's keystrokes, with a special emphasis on bank-industry information."

Please forgive the use of the word "police" :).
It seems obvious to me, and confirmed by other discussion on this list,
that ZH is a troll.
a) He is off-topic.
b) He doesn't make coherent, logical arguments.
c) He makes noise to imply that he enjoys your pain.
d) He has confessed that he is really a 10 year old boy who hasn't found
out how to masturbate to relieve his tension.
Why not do what the wise people say and "don't feed the trolls" (this
means DO NOT REPLY)? Do not reply even if he sends nazi propaganda. Do
not reply if he tortures cats. Do not reply even if he misspells your
name. Do not reply with logical arguments. Do not reply with kindness.
Do not reply! It's called shunning. In personal life this can have
devastating effect. I have doubts about the effectiveness here.
"Whack-a-troll"? If collective action here was effective, he would come

Let's assume the USA "constitution" does not forbid barter :)
General Michael Flynn blasts Hillary Clinton and her crimes: ‘I’m sick
of it. She should step down’
Wikileaks whistleblower revealed as deep state officials. Former deputy
Assistant Secretary of State warns of Clinton coup d’etat
Attorney General Loretta Lynch seems to be in the pocket of the
Clintons, intervening and obstructing FBI investigations into Hillary
Clinton’s private server and e-mails at every turn. James Comey, who was
on the board of directors at HSBC bank, a bank that gave $81 million to
the Clinton Foundation, is also the current head of the FBI.
Donna Brazile tweets in desperation, “Please God, let this end soon” as
CNN gives her the boot
Clinton family henchman James Carville goes insane, says ‘KGB and
Republicans’ are behind FBI investigation
James Carville tries to finger the ‘KGB’ over 10 times, followed by
phrases such as ‘America’s democracy is under attack’…
“The KGB is all over this election.”
“This is an attempt to hijack an election.”
- First, the KGB does not even exist, making Carville look like an
complete nutcase every time he mentions the word ‘KGB’.
- Second, not one US intelligence Agency has confirmed the Russian
government or FSB was behind the hacking.
FBI says no connection between Donald Trump and Russia. Harry Reid goes
full “McCarthy”
Perhaps here lies part of the answer:
How Putin Derailed the West's Grand Project to Remake the World
This is hard for ordinary people to understand. They can’t grasp why
elite powerbrokers would want to transform functioning, stable countries
into uninhabitable wastelands overrun by armed extremists, sectarian
death squads and foreign-born terrorists. Nor can they understand what
has been gained by Washington’s 15 year-long rampage across the Middle
East and Central Asia that has turned a vast swathe of strategic
territory into a terrorist breeding grounds? What is the purpose of all
But the real escalation is expected to take place when Hillary Clinton
becomes president in 2017. That’s when the US will directly engage
Russia militarily, assuming that their tit-for-tat encounters will be
contained within Syria’s borders. It’s a risky plan, but it’s the next
logical step in this bloody fiasco.

-------- Original Message --------
Sorry, an important observation. After receiving a very cruel and aggressive private message, it's better to explain what I was trying to say.
When I said "more cypher", I was _not_ talking about cryptography, coding and technical subjects only, but about more security and privacy discussions, instead garbage like Russian political propaganda.
I am pure chaos and it seems contraditory, but I did mention "less punks", asking for more focus, more emphasis in our present and future surveillance. We all, the whole world is very fucked and it will become worse, much worse. We can -- at least try -- to minimize the impacts of these bad things in the world, in our own lives, in the lives of our beloved ones.
I was just asking for a little less of craziness and mess, for more focus and rational discussions, not for censorship.
Sorry for my bad, ridiculous English. Some people here have much free time for sending more than 750 stupid spams and horrible, nasty messages (number still increasing daily) and searching beautiful words in the dictionary to pretend some eloquence, but it is _not_ my case.
My English is a disaster, a shame, I recognize it. At least, I can understand well five languages, more or less one other, and I am learning another one. Oh, and I also know two Italian dialets. I have no perfection even in my own primary language, but I like words and reading, searching for different ideas, learning more about other cultures. Sorry for using my so horrible and offensive English here.
Also, sorry for knowing "absolutely anything" about coding and cryptography, for being so "stupid and limited" and deserving no respect when asking for "more cypher". I swear I am trying to become better in all these aspects.
Thank you all for your patience with my insignificant existence. I want a better world to everybody. I can't understand so much hate, so much bitterness in some interactions. I am pretending to be "dead" because I was tired of so much useless noise, but some persons here are already dead inside. Really dead, with no good feelings or ideas to donate to the world.
Oh, and sorry for mentioning the Halloween. I love it. I did _not_ imagine it could be so offensive for some persons just for being a "North American party". We also celebrate it in my country, using Brazilian cultural elements, our folklore and miths.
Wish you all happy days and nights, a lovely life. Take care, guys! ;)

So, why do you bother with it, and with your world-reheating
I made it quite clear why that list is a cesspool =) - Check

third-rate, nerdy, pseudo-technical talk. Pretty much useless.
Or more correctly, pretty useful as far as not dealing with
fundamental issues goes. A collection of useful 'idiots'. Not
idiots of course but fully corrupt clowns.
Well, since any 'american' forum, including this one, is usually
100% 'american' propaganda, russian propaganda at least brings
some variety to the table.
But I can understand how russian propaganda would upset a few

For the record - Zen has NEVER denied the holocaust, you cock sucker. NEVER!
He published ONE political-historical essay that discussed about A LOT of things and .... that was published on some holocaust denier site.. and TA-DAM... johny new-man (dick-man) took it as the ONLY and the MAJOR hook he's got on Zen and now he bites him with it every Monday and Saturday.

Right. But not repeating word by word the exact propaganda
figures of the anglo-americans and the zionists is a mortal sin.
A lot of people were killed in the two world wars including of
course jews and the numbers are always going to be manipulated.
Hardly surprising. The 'judeo' christian anglo americans and
other western imperialists keep harping on one particular
atrocity (which by the way they didn't lift a finger to
prevent) as a means to divert attention from all the other
atroticites they daily commit.

Sorry, an important observation. After receiving a very cruel and aggressive private message, it's better to explain what I was trying to say.
When I said "more cypher", I was _not_ talking about cryptography, coding and technical subjects only, but about more security and privacy discussions, instead garbage like Russian political propaganda.
I am pure chaos and it seems contraditory, but I did mention "less punks", asking for more focus, more emphasis in our present and future surveillance. We all, the whole world is very fucked and it will become worse, much worse. We can -- at least try -- to minimize the impacts of these bad things in the world, in our own lives, in the lives of our beloved ones.
I was just asking for a little less of craziness and mess, for more focus and rational discussions, not for censorship.
Sorry for my bad, ridiculous English. Some people here have much free time for sending more than 750 stupid spams and horrible, nasty messages (number still increasing daily) and searching beautiful words in the dictionary to pretend some eloquence, but it is _not_ my case.
My English is a disaster, a shame, I recognize it. At least, I can understand well five languages, more or less one other, and I am learning another one. Oh, and I also know two Italian dialets. I have no perfection even in my own primary language, but I like words and reading, searching for different ideas, learning more about other cultures. Sorry for using my so horrible and offensive English here.
Also, sorry for knowing "absolutely anything" about coding and cryptography, for being so "stupid and limited" and deserving no respect when asking for "more cypher". I swear I am trying to become better in all these aspects.
Thank you all for your patience with my insignificant existence. I want a better world to everybody. I can't understand so much hate, so much bitterness in some interactions. I am pretending to be "dead" because I was tired of so much useless noise, but some persons here are already dead inside. Really dead, with no good feelings or ideas to donate to the world.
Oh, and sorry for mentioning the Halloween. I love it. I did _not_ imagine it could be so offensive for some persons just for being a "North American party". We also celebrate it in my country, using Brazilian cultural elements, our folklore and miths.
Wish you all happy days and nights, a lovely life. Take care, guys! ;)

Yes, that's an important distinction. As I understand it, cypherpunk is
about protection of privacy, and disruption of oppressive systems,

some of that is unavoidable. But best is concise and funny :)

[UPDATE: September 2016: nearly two years after being written, this piece has become a documentary of the same name: “ Diary of a Person of Interest” which is available for [free on Vimeo.com]( and also [on You Tube]( Please watch it and share it! Documentary release notes are here at [this pastebin link]( Thank you!]
Diary of a Person of Interest
As for-profit, private sector, sub-contracted “Asset Tracking” (an Orwellian term that masks it’s true meaning – Spying On You) and related “investigatory” companies are being brought to light in the mainstream, it seems useful to share some insight into a day in the life of a subject of such unsavoury attention.
For no longer is the subject of state surveillance the traditional ‘criminal’ stereotype – but in fact regular people. The Persons of Interest are anyone with any access to any kind of information that is of even the vaguest interest to anyone with access to the apparently monolithic state spying apparatus.
Add in [two degrees of separation]( to the “Asset Tracking” – ie., everyone the Person knows and everyone that they know for good measure, and you have everyone from suburban mothers to doctors to fishermen to airhostesses to school Principals getting followed around and having their communications pried into by total strangers.
While it is indeed an issue of immoral and intrusive surveillance, there is more to it. Once targeted by the state, there is an all encompassing psychological warfare as you are systematically conditioned to having the most intimate parts of your life laid open to all and sundry, for them to manipulate and, in some cases, profit from.
No act can be undertaken naturally – from the most banal decisions made in the bathroom to any attempt to have a relationship with another person. The more you are psychologically poked and prodded, the more you are forced to sidestep entrapment efforts, the more exacerbated your mental isolation, living in a world where the only person you can truly rely upon is yourself.
Decisions you make have complex and far-reaching consequences, not just for yourself but for the numerous people who knowingly or unknowingly will be affected by any choice you do make, and you live with the constant guilt of the ways in which you are affecting other people’s lives without ever intending to.
Some have described being the victim of such comprehensive intrusion and manipulation as ‘torture’ and suggested it is an issue for the U.N. to investigate.
I don’t personally feel qualified to make such a claim because being inside of it makes it impossible to have the level of detachment required to reduce it to a single blanket statement.
However I do innately know that the following daily thought processes are completely tragic and unnatural, and that humankind cannot continue like this.
Without further adieu: The Diary of a Person of Interest
4.30am – 6.30am: this is the worst time of the day. The entire neighbourhood is asleep but your neighbour’s dogs bark incessantly and you get to listen to the sounds of garage doors scraping and cars that shouldn’t be going anywhere at that time going nonetheless. It pays to be asleep between these hours.
7.30am: Awake on the couch where you slept fully clothed so that there wouldn’t be more footage of you walking around your house naked. The morning, which is structured around beautiful, happy and mostly oblivious children, is the easiest time to forget that you have not enjoyed any domestic privacy for nearly three years. The shrieks to get up, eat breakfast and hurry off out the door are normal morning sounds and familiar to the point of comfortable.
8.30am: It is time to go and you grab your keys, already looking at the cul de sac for the car that will leave ahead of you, and then the other car which will return behind you again after you have dropped the children at school. These cars, and many more, have been trailing you for years now and were a source of great mystery prior to seeing the documentary ‘[Operation 8]( on NZ on Screen and finally clicking as to what was taking place. Funnily enough, back at the beginning, when you were put in the hotseat via Skype to answer 10 fast questions from a total stranger, one of them was whether you knew any of the [Urewera 4]( You didn’t. You had never been an activist or an organiser or an independent journalist nor had any idea the surveillance state existed let alone that you’d one day be targeted by it. Now, after three years of its unwelcome, immoral attentions, you not only know some of them but are represented by their lawyer. In a funny way the persecution and oppression heaped upon you drive you to the very places the state claims to not want you to go, and results in the very friendships being established that they ostensibly don’t want you to have.
9.30am: one of your oldest and best friends in the world has messaged you on Facebook. She misses you and wants to chat. You’ve known her since you were in your early teens and always had a heartfelt connection to her. She is one of the best people you know. But you are scared to respond to her because her husband (who she married many years later) works for the US military. Your very friendship, which you have cherished so much, is now a potential danger to her and also to yourself. What will your activist and media friends and colleagues think of you being friends with someone connected to the military industrial complex? What will your friend and her husband’s facebook friends think of them being connected to a new media activist? Will they and everyone they know end up being spied on just because you and she infrequently profess your love and gratitude for each other’s existence? Is that grounds alone for equal intrusions upon her life, the very fact of the connection? Will your government decide that you must be a U.S. plant because one of your best friends is American? Will they trawl back through your completely innocuous past travels and decide that there must be more to it than you doing your [O.E.]( The questions and implications are endless, and all because she loves you and wants to say hello.
10.30am: you are procrastinating now because you don’t want to do what you should be doing. Crafting business plans for new ventures is no fun when your intellectual property will be read and studied by your government and perhaps others, long before you’ve even had a chance to submit it to the rest of your team members. The complete absence of secure, private communications has consistently led to your ideas and work being stolen for the profit of others, and you are not eager to repeat the experience. Building and creating something when others already have the blueprints is a virtually impossible endeavour. Any alliances you form or opportunities you pursue will be interfered with, be it before during or after your undertaking. Anything of value will be extracted and siphoned off and you just don’t have the energy to try to convince others who are understandably reluctant, of what is possible. While encryption offers some measure of hope in terms of whittling down the number of people with the capacity to penetrate the communications, the cold harsh reality of any hardware you ever own being physically compromised plus the constant monitoring and piggy-backing of all your digital work means that innovation can come only in short bursts and in open source environments with an equal level playing field. Peer to peer is no longer desirable when it is is peer to peer with a man in the middle. Has to be all or nothing and you are relatively content with little to nothing and thus accept the stifling of your full potential.
11.30am: As do many, you both relish and dread social media. As amazing a tool for social change as it has been – as responsible for many of your successes as it has been – it’s true owners have been increasingly asserting their control over it to the extent that nothing can be taken at face value. Strange and beautiful messages intertwine and you are never sure of the true source. Nasty, acerbic regurgitated commentary of your daily struggles appears, alongside gloating or self-important, stuffy rhetoric letting slip key intimacies gained from covertly obtained knowledge of your physical environment and admonishing you. Occasionally, there are outright death threats. The macabre and the vicarious combine and the overall feeling is one of dirtiness, the slime of the negative energy. There are fragments of light but fewer and so distant the sparkle is like a mirage. When everything you see through a screen is malleable – transferable, delayable, manipulable – nothing can be certain, neither the light nor the dark or whether they in fact come from the same source. Messages sent are not necessarily messages received and as the manipulation of your reality is total very little, if anything, can be taken for granted; certainly not at face value. Your entire online experience is tailored and not just for advertising purposes. Your life defined by algorithms that are constantly evolving, by means outside your reach and to ends other than your own. Your every online second is now an opportunity to be misconstrued, to be entrapped, to be monitored. The desire to exercise the human right to communication is now a liability rather than a privilege.
12.30pm: You are hungry but you are just thinking about love again. Day-dreaming. Pining. Love moves you. This has long been determined and is the pinnacle of your psychological profile. The only thing they have found that is guaranteed to make you act is love. For your thoughts are not merely enough. The leeching of your ideas just a value-add to the targeting of you. The real intention is to make you act. To trigger you, provoke you, guide you in the direction they want you to go. For they cannot prosecute a thought – they cannot prosecute a speech. But they can prosecute an act. Where they have forced others to act to their own detriment, the punishment has been swift. Where they have not been able to, the ‘torture’ is prolonged. The surveillance spans years. Way back at the beginning you naievely thought all of this would end up on record. That it was being collected for the purposes of a judge and a jury. As the months under investigation became years, you finally realised – noone is going to give this footage to a judge. Noone is going to film you in your bathroom and then put that on a court record. The vast majority of the surveillance is not collected on the behalf of a court, it is collected for the sole benefit of the financier – whether that be a private funder or the state. These countless intrusions are not for an investigation at all. They are for a very specific set of reasons and it seems, may well now span the entire remainder of your life. Your motivations, once gleaned, are monopolised upon. Your desires are pinpointed and then tantalisingly dangled in front of you – the proverbial carrot. The deal with the devil is to get what you want by giving him what he wants and then hoping he doesn’t reneg on the bargain after the fact. It is a dangerous game, a slippery slope. Your innocent dreams of love and companionship are the weakness by which you are routinely attacked and there are seemingly no limits to what can be done to influence and ultimately control your romantic situation. For the watchers do not just watch – they insert themselves into your life in as many capacities as possible, be it work or social, familial or via acquaintances and friends of friends. They will hit on you in a bar; they will befriend your friends under false pretences, for the sole motivation of getting close enough to you to gain influence or insight. They are Rob Gilchrist. They are Sabu. They will impersonate people you have known for nearly a decade, and with great dedication and preparation, lull you into a false sense of security so that you come to value a relationship which does not exist. Why? So that you will act, and so that they can capture that act, and then wield it against you. Even if it is an act of love, an intimacy, that exists only as a fruit of their deception and manipulation. They falsely believe recording such acts empowers them. In fact, they are holding the evidence of their own despicable natures and dastardly undertakings, in their own hands. What they feel is their victory, in fact exposes them, and not you. This is a valuable insight and you soon learn to own the mistakes, the humiliations, while leaving the shame of them to the perpetrators; the tarnish where it belongs.
1.30pm: Done with psychoanalysing and re-psychoanalyzing every potentiality and its outcome, there is little more than an hour left to do anything worthwhile. Thus the mundane and safe becomes a warm and pleasant coccoon. The actions for which you need not be concerned by hidden strings pulling, manipulated by the hands of hidden puppetmasters. Dishes become a pleasure. Vaccuuming, a release. You dare not check the mail – you have long since lost interest in it as it so often failed to arrive at all and when it did, looked like mice had been eating the corners. You try to have everything redirected just so that you no longer have to be confronted with the cold reality of the intrusions. Harder to escape the physical intrusions. From the first burglary where nothing was stolen and your bathroom window was smashed on the inside, to the little holes that appear in your newly-refinished ceiling. The drill marks in the doorways. The cracks in the top corners of mirrors, of photo-frames. The worn lining in the tops of the doors of your near-new car. The underwear drawer full of underwear torn to the hip. The precious watch from your grandmother; an heirloom, smashed, with its face missing. The brand new 4-pack of socks on top of your dresser that disappears while you are out, with only a dirty pair of used men’s socks left in its place. The roof patch that is removed as soon as the workmen replace it there. The car tyres that somehow periodically get road spikes embedded in them. The oil cap that conveniently disappears into thin air. Yes, it is not just the surveillance, it is the holistic sabotage, the psychological warfare, that is the true burden of the Person of Interest.
3:00pm: Briefly life returns to the normal chaos of excitable children and domestic routine. Wondering what to have for dinner brings its own welcome respite, as does visits and extra-curricular activities. You become grateful for the most mundane mechanics of the suburban Matrix, which now seem a luxury. Although you are well-aware you are already in a jail cell and have been for years – albeit a more nicely appointed jail cell than the traditional idea of one – any lapse in external interference is gratefully received, with the relief of a dog that has ceased being whipped, even if only momentarily.
5.30pm: You are long since accustomed to the strange, uncomfortable or vacant looks of those who once held you in normal regard. Well aware that part of the attack on your character and person is for others to spread gossip and rumours, or approach those on the periphery and encourage them to turn their scorn upon you for whatever reason, be it real or manufactured. You are used to not being able to answer the most basic questions; of never really knowing what does or doesn’t have hidden meaning, or in what way you will be judged for your honesty. The most perfunctory answers and social norms seem inherently dishonest. The urge, the driving force to state things as they are under any cirumstance, always balanced against perceived self-interest, out of sheer necessity. For if you do not watch your own back, who will? Who better than you understands what you are going through?
8.00pm: Thanks to immoral legislation and the ambivalence of the state towards the individual privacies of Persons of Interest, strangers will watch you read to your children tonight. Just as they watched you play the piano, reviewed what songs you looked at on You Tube and scoffed as you chased a mouse around the kitchen, trying to humanely catch it. Your family time is undertaken in the manner of The Truman Show – centerpieces to the analysis and amusement of others. Those who fashion themselves Gods but are not worthy of the title. Once all is again quiet, you will relegate yourself back to the couch and wonder to whom you can reach out – to whom your silent pleas will be answered. By your friends? By your enemies? Or are they one and the same? Too many times you have been made promises, too many times you have made promises and been prevented from keeping them. The great spiral of the unknown makes you aware that the tiny fragments you do know and can hold on to are such insignificant pieces of the puzzle that you are prevented from ever truly being the architect of your own destiny. Instead you must rock, roll, tumble with the blows, take them as they come, and find solitude and safety only in your dreams.

Probably for "John Young", an old cypherpunk, a researcher who I admire and respect a lot. If I was John Young, wow, I would see my own reflex in the mirror and would think all the days: "Oh, guy! You ARE the man!" ;)
See it: JY has much more to do than being a troll bacon.
Thanks for trust me, John. The baby trolls are trying to create flames wars among us. Dumb babies, haha! ;)
It was too dramatic for my taste, John. :)

its not rocket science to figure out that a site that hosts CIA names and address and other confidental shit that there is some sort of cooperation at some level -
its all a bunch of sites promoting illigal activity. Go ahead and run OnionScan see what you find - cloning and spoofing darknet URL's is a favorite he he!

-------- Original Message --------
[UPDATE: September 2016: nearly two years after being written, this piece has become a documentary of the same name: “ Diary of a Person of Interest” which is available for [free on Vimeo.com]( and also [on You Tube]( Please watch it and share it! Documentary release notes are here at [this pastebin link]( Thank you!]
Diary of a Person of Interest
As for-profit, private sector, sub-contracted “Asset Tracking” (an Orwellian term that masks it’s true meaning – Spying On You) and related “investigatory” companies are being brought to light in the mainstream, it seems useful to share some insight into a day in the life of a subject of such unsavoury attention.
For no longer is the subject of state surveillance the traditional ‘criminal’ stereotype – but in fact regular people. The Persons of Interest are anyone with any access to any kind of information that is of even the vaguest interest to anyone with access to the apparently monolithic state spying apparatus.
Add in [two degrees of separation]( to the “Asset Tracking” – ie., everyone the Person knows and everyone that they know for good measure, and you have everyone from suburban mothers to doctors to fishermen to airhostesses to school Principals getting followed around and having their communications pried into by total strangers.
While it is indeed an issue of immoral and intrusive surveillance, there is more to it. Once targeted by the state, there is an all encompassing psychological warfare as you are systematically conditioned to having the most intimate parts of your life laid open to all and sundry, for them to manipulate and, in some cases, profit from.
No act can be undertaken naturally – from the most banal decisions made in the bathroom to any attempt to have a relationship with another person. The more you are psychologically poked and prodded, the more you are forced to sidestep entrapment efforts, the more exacerbated your mental isolation, living in a world where the only person you can truly rely upon is yourself.
Decisions you make have complex and far-reaching consequences, not just for yourself but for the numerous people who knowingly or unknowingly will be affected by any choice you do make, and you live with the constant guilt of the ways in which you are affecting other people’s lives without ever intending to.
Some have described being the victim of such comprehensive intrusion and manipulation as ‘torture’ and suggested it is an issue for the U.N. to investigate.
I don’t personally feel qualified to make such a claim because being inside of it makes it impossible to have the level of detachment required to reduce it to a single blanket statement.
However I do innately know that the following daily thought processes are completely tragic and unnatural, and that humankind cannot continue like this.
Without further adieu: The Diary of a Person of Interest
4.30am – 6.30am: this is the worst time of the day. The entire neighbourhood is asleep but your neighbour’s dogs bark incessantly and you get to listen to the sounds of garage doors scraping and cars that shouldn’t be going anywhere at that time going nonetheless. It pays to be asleep between these hours.
7.30am: Awake on the couch where you slept fully clothed so that there wouldn’t be more footage of you walking around your house naked. The morning, which is structured around beautiful, happy and mostly oblivious children, is the easiest time to forget that you have not enjoyed any domestic privacy for nearly three years. The shrieks to get up, eat breakfast and hurry off out the door are normal morning sounds and familiar to the point of comfortable.
8.30am: It is time to go and you grab your keys, already looking at the cul de sac for the car that will leave ahead of you, and then the other car which will return behind you again after you have dropped the children at school. These cars, and many more, have been trailing you for years now and were a source of great mystery prior to seeing the documentary ‘[Operation 8]( on NZ on Screen and finally clicking as to what was taking place. Funnily enough, back at the beginning, when you were put in the hotseat via Skype to answer 10 fast questions from a total stranger, one of them was whether you knew any of the [Urewera 4]( You didn’t. You had never been an activist or an organiser or an independent journalist nor had any idea the surveillance state existed let alone that you’d one day be targeted by it. Now, after three years of its unwelcome, immoral attentions, you not only know some of them but are represented by their lawyer. In a funny way the persecution and oppression heaped upon you drive you to the very places the state claims to not want you to go, and results in the very friendships being established that they ostensibly don’t want you to have.
9.30am: one of your oldest and best friends in the world has messaged you on Facebook. She misses you and wants to chat. You’ve known her since you were in your early teens and always had a heartfelt connection to her. She is one of the best people you know. But you are scared to respond to her because her husband (who she married many years later) works for the US military. Your very friendship, which you have cherished so much, is now a potential danger to her and also to yourself. What will your activist and media friends and colleagues think of you being friends with someone connected to the military industrial complex? What will your friend and her husband’s facebook friends think of them being connected to a new media activist? Will they and everyone they know end up being spied on just because you and she infrequently profess your love and gratitude for each other’s existence? Is that grounds alone for equal intrusions upon her life, the very fact of the connection? Will your government decide that you must be a U.S. plant because one of your best friends is American? Will they trawl back through your completely innocuous past travels and decide that there must be more to it than you doing your [O.E.]( The questions and implications are endless, and all because she loves you and wants to say hello.
10.30am: you are procrastinating now because you don’t want to do what you should be doing. Crafting business plans for new ventures is no fun when your intellectual property will be read and studied by your government and perhaps others, long before you’ve even had a chance to submit it to the rest of your team members. The complete absence of secure, private communications has consistently led to your ideas and work being stolen for the profit of others, and you are not eager to repeat the experience. Building and creating something when others already have the blueprints is a virtually impossible endeavour. Any alliances you form or opportunities you pursue will be interfered with, be it before during or after your undertaking. Anything of value will be extracted and siphoned off and you just don’t have the energy to try to convince others who are understandably reluctant, of what is possible. While encryption offers some measure of hope in terms of whittling down the number of people with the capacity to penetrate the communications, the cold harsh reality of any hardware you ever own being physically compromised plus the constant monitoring and piggy-backing of all your digital work means that innovation can come only in short bursts and in open source environments with an equal level playing field. Peer to peer is no longer desirable when it is is peer to peer with a man in the middle. Has to be all or nothing and you are relatively content with little to nothing and thus accept the stifling of your full potential.
11.30am: As do many, you both relish and dread social media. As amazing a tool for social change as it has been – as responsible for many of your successes as it has been – it’s true owners have been increasingly asserting their control over it to the extent that nothing can be taken at face value. Strange and beautiful messages intertwine and you are never sure of the true source. Nasty, acerbic regurgitated commentary of your daily struggles appears, alongside gloating or self-important, stuffy rhetoric letting slip key intimacies gained from covertly obtained knowledge of your physical environment and admonishing you. Occasionally, there are outright death threats. The macabre and the vicarious combine and the overall feeling is one of dirtiness, the slime of the negative energy. There are fragments of light but fewer and so distant the sparkle is like a mirage. When everything you see through a screen is malleable – transferable, delayable, manipulable – nothing can be certain, neither the light nor the dark or whether they in fact come from the same source. Messages sent are not necessarily messages received and as the manipulation of your reality is total very little, if anything, can be taken for granted; certainly not at face value. Your entire online experience is tailored and not just for advertising purposes. Your life defined by algorithms that are constantly evolving, by means outside your reach and to ends other than your own. Your every online second is now an opportunity to be misconstrued, to be entrapped, to be monitored. The desire to exercise the human right to communication is now a liability rather than a privilege.
12.30pm: You are hungry but you are just thinking about love again. Day-dreaming. Pining. Love moves you. This has long been determined and is the pinnacle of your psychological profile. The only thing they have found that is guaranteed to make you act is love. For your thoughts are not merely enough. The leeching of your ideas just a value-add to the targeting of you. The real intention is to make you act. To trigger you, provoke you, guide you in the direction they want you to go. For they cannot prosecute a thought – they cannot prosecute a speech. But they can prosecute an act. Where they have forced others to act to their own detriment, the punishment has been swift. Where they have not been able to, the ‘torture’ is prolonged. The surveillance spans years. Way back at the beginning you naievely thought all of this would end up on record. That it was being collected for the purposes of a judge and a jury. As the months under investigation became years, you finally realised – noone is going to give this footage to a judge. Noone is going to film you in your bathroom and then put that on a court record. The vast majority of the surveillance is not collected on the behalf of a court, it is collected for the sole benefit of the financier – whether that be a private funder or the state. These countless intrusions are not for an investigation at all. They are for a very specific set of reasons and it seems, may well now span the entire remainder of your life. Your motivations, once gleaned, are monopolised upon. Your desires are pinpointed and then tantalisingly dangled in front of you – the proverbial carrot. The deal with the devil is to get what you want by giving him what he wants and then hoping he doesn’t reneg on the bargain after the fact. It is a dangerous game, a slippery slope. Your innocent dreams of love and companionship are the weakness by which you are routinely attacked and there are seemingly no limits to what can be done to influence and ultimately control your romantic situation. For the watchers do not just watch – they insert themselves into your life in as many capacities as possible, be it work or social, familial or via acquaintances and friends of friends. They will hit on you in a bar; they will befriend your friends under false pretences, for the sole motivation of getting close enough to you to gain influence or insight. They are Rob Gilchrist. They are Sabu. They will impersonate people you have known for nearly a decade, and with great dedication and preparation, lull you into a false sense of security so that you come to value a relationship which does not exist. Why? So that you will act, and so that they can capture that act, and then wield it against you. Even if it is an act of love, an intimacy, that exists only as a fruit of their deception and manipulation. They falsely believe recording such acts empowers them. In fact, they are holding the evidence of their own despicable natures and dastardly undertakings, in their own hands. What they feel is their victory, in fact exposes them, and not you. This is a valuable insight and you soon learn to own the mistakes, the humiliations, while leaving the shame of them to the perpetrators; the tarnish where it belongs.
1.30pm: Done with psychoanalysing and re-psychoanalyzing every potentiality and its outcome, there is little more than an hour left to do anything worthwhile. Thus the mundane and safe becomes a warm and pleasant coccoon. The actions for which you need not be concerned by hidden strings pulling, manipulated by the hands of hidden puppetmasters. Dishes become a pleasure. Vaccuuming, a release. You dare not check the mail – you have long since lost interest in it as it so often failed to arrive at all and when it did, looked like mice had been eating the corners. You try to have everything redirected just so that you no longer have to be confronted with the cold reality of the intrusions. Harder to escape the physical intrusions. From the first burglary where nothing was stolen and your bathroom window was smashed on the inside, to the little holes that appear in your newly-refinished ceiling. The drill marks in the doorways. The cracks in the top corners of mirrors, of photo-frames. The worn lining in the tops of the doors of your near-new car. The underwear drawer full of underwear torn to the hip. The precious watch from your grandmother; an heirloom, smashed, with its face missing. The brand new 4-pack of socks on top of your dresser that disappears while you are out, with only a dirty pair of used men’s socks left in its place. The roof patch that is removed as soon as the workmen replace it there. The car tyres that somehow periodically get road spikes embedded in them. The oil cap that conveniently disappears into thin air. Yes, it is not just the surveillance, it is the holistic sabotage, the psychological warfare, that is the true burden of the Person of Interest.

Although you are well-aware you are already in a jail cell and have been for years – albeit a more nicely appointed jail cell than the traditional idea of one – any lapse in external interference is gratefully received, with the relief of a dog that has ceased being whipped, even if only momentarily.
