@_subject: Replacing corporate search engines with anonymous/decentralized 
Hi there,
did anyone come across yacy[0]?
It's a crawling software, that creates an shared index within a defined realm.
I can say that it's OSS (GPL), but I had no time to inspect the code.
I'm wondering, what's this list's opinion on it.
