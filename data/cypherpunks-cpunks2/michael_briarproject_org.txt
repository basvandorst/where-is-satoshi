Hi Jens,
Last year I spent some time playing with audio encoding of data for
transmission over handheld radios. The state of the art here is dialup
modems - on a good day they can get 56,000 bits per second over a
channel designed for voice, but that requires advanced modulation and
error correction techniques. The radio hams have packet radio (AX.25
and APRS) running at 1,200-9,600 bps over long distances using simple
modulation and no error correction. Some early home computers used
audio cassettes for storage (300-1,200 bps, CUTS or Kansas City Standard).
If you want to support purely one-way communication (no acks), you'll
need to forward error correct the data. Hamming codes and parity
checks are simple to implement but they'll eat a lot of your
bandwidth; Reed-Solomon codes are more bandwidth-efficient but also
more complex.
Some Java code for modulation, framing and error correction is here if
you're interested:
