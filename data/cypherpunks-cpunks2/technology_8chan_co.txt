Cicada: A Distributed Direct Democracy and Decentralized Application
github.com/the-laughing-monkey/cicada-platform + /archive/master.zip
This paper outlines a revolutionary, open source, decentralized
application platform (DAPP) along with its first major application, a
distributed direct democracy (DDD). To create something scalable enough
to run an entire nation with no representatives, we created two cutting
edge technologies to serve as the foundation of the platform:
1] A decentralized, privacy guaranteeing Human Unique Identifier (HUID)
unique to every person on the planet that returns control of personally
identifying information (PII) back to individuals, allowing for
revocable role based access control to that data.
2] A new Distributed Proof of Work (DPoW) backed blockchain that is
immune to centralization because of a unified client/miner with only one
miner allowed per person, linked anonymously to a HUID. Miners are
randomly drafted into built-in pools, meaning everyone contributes yet
nobody dominates. The system provides a workable UNIVERSAL BASIC INCOME
(UBI), i.e., it pays users to participate, since everyone is drafted to
secure the network. It is incredibly energy efficient because it does
not mine all the time and it is also storage efficient because it uses a
Distributed Hash Table (DHT) of historical blockchain transactions,
allowing it to fit and run on a cell phone.
