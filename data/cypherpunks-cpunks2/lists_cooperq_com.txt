Moxie and crew have a history of writing some pretty fantastic crypto
software! In the past they have written redphone (Signal is the iOS
version of this) and text secure, both of which are IMO some of the best
crypto software out there right now.  Aditionally signal is  free (as in
beer and in freedom) and open source.  I would wholeheartedly recommend
Signal.  My only caveat would be that since it is so new there are
likely some pretty serious bugs that have not been discovered yet.
