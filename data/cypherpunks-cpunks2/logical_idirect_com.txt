@_subject: Software for pop-ups and anti-virus 
Do you hate receiving Pop Ups while on-line?  Get this Pop Up Killer from  . Pop Up Killer shoots them dead.  It's FREE and I love it.
A friend told me about a new FREE Virus killer called Anti Vir.  I downloaded it today from  Good Lord, it found 3 different viruses on my computer that McAfee, Inoculate, PC-illin and  could not find.  Anti Vir searched through 111,000 files on my two hard drives.  The best of the other 4 only searched through 80,000 files.  How could they miss the other 31,000 files?
Good Health and Happiness to you All.
