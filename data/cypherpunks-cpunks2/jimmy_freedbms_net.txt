6 Major Media Conspiracies Happening Right in Front of Your Eyes
Sigmund Fraud, Staff Writer
By WakingTimes October 5, 2016
Woven into the ever-evolving narrative of the mainstream media are key
plot lines, hidden in the sub-text of so-called current events, going
for the most part unnoticed by the public. We could say this happens by
chance but since we already know the structure and purpose of corporate
media, this would be naive and dangerously forgiving of an organization
that plays an authoritative role in manufacturing reality. And since
political, economic, social and environmental reality is an affront to
our greatest human potential, to say the least, it serves us well to
acknowledge and expose the directives we are being provoked into
accepting and acting on.
  “This complete utter and total connection between perception and
  experience is understood by that hidden hand, and that’s why the human
  mind is bombarded 24/7 with downloads of perception.” ~David Icke
Conspiracy. An abused word, but one with tremendous relevance today, as
no other word in the english language adequately synthesizes the
concepts of plot, motive and wicked intention. Love or hate the word
itself, when an examination of media in its relation to reality is given
proper due with respect for historical and philosophical truth, it
requires willful ignorance to dismiss the fact that there are
conspiracies at play in our world, and therefore theories are required
to understand and expose them.
There a handful of major conspiracies driving the mainline media’s
direction of our attention onto whatever nonsense, propaganda or disinfo
happens to be soup du jour for public consumption. Awareness of these
disrupts the pattern of top-down, in-your-face control, offering the
freedom to consume media without unconscious obligation to the subduing
and pacifying world view being forced down our throats by our
information overlords.
Here are five of the most important and prominent media conspiracies
constantly at work on the public psyche. All are absolutely essential to
support and maintain the status quo.
1. The Conspiracy to Make You Love the State Indoctrination into the
   nurturing womb of the state is essential for our society to function
   as it does. As children, we are taught the state’s version of
   national and international history, we pledge allegiance to the state
   flag, and we learn a superficial version of how state government
   works while being told the only alternative is destructive chaos.
   This theme of state indoctrination carries on into the mainstream
   media as state worship is embedded into news, infotainment and
   entertainment.  The most important people are those in public office.
   The most important opinions come from state employees turned pundits.
   The most important decisions are those made by the government. Heroes
   are soldiers. There is no issue or concern which does not warrant
   action from the state.
2. The Conspiracy to Conceal the True Powers in the World There is an
   invisible unelected power which controls government and industry
   around the world, yet no matter how many warnings we receive from
   even the most credentialed individuals, the media will never
   genuinely report on the shadow government, the deep state, secret
   societies, or the Zionist neocons, opting instead to direct our
   attention onto government, maintaining the impression that major
   decisions are made democratically.
   Consider how many years it has taken for even basic, propagandistic
   coverage of Bilderberg to make it to the mainstream. The Bilderberg
   Group is a gathering of the world’s most powerful private, corporate,
   and state actors, yet the media still wants you to believe their
   influence in our world is but a theory.
   Furthermore, the banking institutions which have monopolized world
   currencies into private hands charging every interest for the ability
   to trade, are fully misrepresented by the media as benevolent and
   ‘too big to fail,’ ie., too big to prosecute. For a recent example of
   this, look to CNN Money who put together a shoddy segment on the
   Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, explaining to the audience
   how it was not at all political, but rather an independent group
   intentionally designed in
   1913 for our benefit.
   Why the Federal Reserve isn't political
3. The Conspiracy to Cover Up the Corporate Rape of the Planet The rape
   of the planet physically, economically and spiritually by corporate
   power and greed is escalating on a global scale, yet the mainstream
   refuses to give this issue its proper due. Corporations are presented
   as society’s saviors, bringing us the jobs and conveniences that make
   life bearable, yet, while we may profit in material terms in the
   short term, corporate exploitation of the world and its cultures is
   quickly pushing us into unknown territory where the world’s wealth
   will be given over to the 1%, and the world’s eco-systems are laid
   waste.
   The Dakota Sioux protest over the Keystone XL pipeline offers a
   recent example of how corporate media treats important environmental
   issues resulting from corporate dominance. Silence. Although organic
   resistance to this is huge and widely covered by the alternative
   media, only natural disasters that stoke irrational fears make the
   nightly news.
   When was the last time the mainstream news ran an expose of the
   Athabasca Oil Sands project, or of the widespread destruction of the
   Amazon rainforest? These issues are vastly critical to our survival,
   yet never explored by corporate media. Even something as crucial as
   Fukushima, which is still dumping radiation into the Pacific Ocean
   five years after the earthquake and tsunami of 2011, gets nary a
   mention.  This disaster is put off as a local Japanese issue and all
   attempts to bring closure to this are left the hands of TEPCO, the
   Japanese energy corporation, even in the face of mounting evidence
   that Fukushima is already affecting life in North America.
4. The Conspiracy to Encourage Self-Destruction In order to create and
   maintain the culture of top-down rule, it is mandatory that the
   populace suffers interminable disunity, widespread apathy, infighting
   and senseless division. This is fomented by the mainline media’s
   assistance in the destruction of the individual; for our own
   self-destruction is the most economical solution for the elite in
   their quest to destroy us.
   The vibration of the news is always as dense as possible, a continual
   flood of violence, hate, gore and madness, ever refusing concepts and
   ideas that enlighten, focusing instead on the repetition of insanity.
   Corporate media, especially from Hollywood, is a non-stop psychic
   assault serving to color darkly our souls, driving us into inner
   despair, suggesting to us that we self-medicate, guiding us into the
   hands of modern psychology for relief from the onslaught.
   When the individual is useless to himself, he is useless to his
   community and to society as a whole. When this is accomplished it is
   easy to corral us into narrow frames of mind and widespread division,
   working against ourselves rather than for ourselves.

   War in America
5. The Conspiracy to Arrest Consciousness The war on consciousness is
   real. It is a concerted effort to prevent the individual from
   understanding the true nature of the self, from gaining critical
   self-knowledge, and from maturing beyond childish naivety and
   intelligence. The prosecution of the war on drugs, heavily promoted
   in corporate media, is a key strategy, for it inhibits our
   willingness to explore our own sovereign consciousness, cutting us
   off from ancient and natural tools of self-exploration, limiting our
   understanding of what is possible in this human experience.
   As researcher and author Graham Hancock states:
      “There can be no more intimate and elemental part of the
      individual than his or her own consciousness. At the deepest
      level, our consciousness is what we are—to the extent that if we
      are not sovereign over our own consciousness then we cannot in any
      meaningful sense be sovereign over anything else either. ” ~Graham
      Hancock
6. The Conspiracy to Prevent Revolution We are quickly entering a time
   when the only way for the elite to prevent revolution is to enact the
   strict social controls only possible in a world war type scenario,
   which is presently unfolding before our sleepwalking eyes. The
   mainstream media participates in the conspiracy to prevent revolution
   by constantly reinforcing false state narratives about security,
   privacy and the need for more control, and by continually
   manufacturing consent for the oligarchy.
   The main objective is to prevent disbelief in official government
   stories and narratives, regularly engaging on the trigger term
   ‘conspiracy theory‘ to deflate curiosity of the unknown and
   misunderstood workings of our government. The media are moulding us
   into self-monitoring, self-policing gatekeepers who are trained to
   reject revolutionary ideas before they are duly investigated.
Final Thoughts
When so much of the information we intake is controlled by so few
organizations, and the messages we most receive combine to transform us
into dis-empowered non-actors in a world being taken over by untouchable
global powers, we can safely call it a conspiracy.
The solution, of course, requires us to tune out of corporate media and
engage self-education, self-knowledge and in participation in community.

What the CIA Does When The Other Side Won't Fight Former CIA Deputy Director, Michael Morell, in an amazingly frank TV interview, explains how the CIA assassinates people close to the world leaders that they want to topple. Rather than killing the leaders, themselves, they kill their closest associates to let the leaders know they can be knocked off any time the CIA wants. The goal is to create enough fear and anger to cause the leaders to retaliate in some way that then can be used as proof of their evil nature and as an excuse to wage all-out war against them. The killing of Putin’s favorite chauffeur is a dramatic example that Morell’s plan is a reality.
