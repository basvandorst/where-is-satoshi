@_subject: surveillance, its proponents and its opponents 
I think the idea of accountability is a grand one, really. Unfortunately, no doubt the camera will be the ‘end all be all’ of evidential proof, and as we know, footage will be able to be modified, at a cost, when the need arises. The low end of this is perhaps blaming the ‘lack’ of recording of an event as a technological failure, no doubt to be seen in the wild, if only for scapegoating and quieting the nay-sayers of footage validity — Ie. If it were not real, why would we go through the work to edit it, when instead it’d be far easier to blame on a technological issue/battery/blahblahblah.
It’s in fact not true accountability at all; it’s accountability in veil — A supporter of whatever agenda ‘they’ wish to pursue.
Speaking of “Obamacare”, I have zero intentions of playing along. I wish most felt the same way. If no one ‘subscribed’, succumbed to the threats (oh oh, sorry, ‘tax’) of not having insurance, the system wouldn’t work, wouldn’t exist. People would find a way to make enough money ‘under the table’ to cover the ‘tax’ for not having such required insurance. ‘Taxable’ incomes would drop, decently, or significantly, not only for the ‘rich’ (they do this to avoid taxes, obviously) but for the average working layman as well.
What a glorious day for society when we slowly start to starve the state.

No worries, JUAN, they promise no backdoors… (I’m with you on your design stance, btw)
"The Tor Social Contract
Posted August 9th, 2016 by alison  in At The Tor Project, we make tools that help promote and protect the essential human rights of people everywhere. We have a set of guiding principles that make that possible, but for a long time, those principles were more or less unspoken. In order to ensure that project members build a Tor that reflects the commitment to our ideals, we've taken a cue from our friends at Debian and written the Tor Social Contract -- the set of principles that show who we are and why we make Tor.
Our social contract is a set of behaviors and goals: not just the promised results we want for our community, but the ways we seek to achieve them. We want to grow Tor by supporting and advancing these guidelines in the time we are working on Tor, while taking care not to undermine them in the rest of our time.
The principles can also be used to help recognize when people's actions or intents are hurting Tor. Some of these principles are established norms; things we've been doing every day for a long time; while others are more aspirational -- but all of them are values we want to live in public, and we hope they will make our future choices easier and more open. This social contract is one of several documents that define our community standards, so if you're looking for things that aren't here (e.g. something that might be in a code of conduct) bear in mind that they might exist, in a different document.
Social goals can be complex. If there is ever tension in the application of the following principles, we will always strive to place highest priority on the safety and freedom of any who would use the fruits of our endeavors. The social contract can also help us work through such tensions -- for example, there are times when we might have a need to use tools that are not completely open (contradicting point 2) but opening them would undermine our users' safety (contradicting point 6). Using such a tool should be weighed against how much it's needed to make our technologies usable (point 1). And if we do use such a tool, we must be honest about its capabilities and limits (point 5). Tor is not just software, but a labor of love produced by an international community of people devoted to human rights. This social contract is a promise from our internal community to the rest of the world, affirming our commitment to our beliefs. We are excited to present it to you.
1. We advance human rights by creating and deploying usable anonymity and privacy technologies.
We believe that privacy, the free exchange of ideas, and access to information are essential to free societies. Through our community standards and the code we write, we provide tools that help all people protect and advance these rights.
2. Open and transparent research and tools are key to our success.
We are committed to transparency; therefore, everything we release is open and our development happens in the open. Whenever feasible, we will continue to make our source code, binaries, and claims about them open to independent verification. In the extremely rare cases where open development would undermine the security of our users, we will be especially vigilant in our peer review by project members.
3. Our tools are free to access, use, adapt, and distribute.
The more diverse our users, the less is implied about any person by simply being a Tor user. This diversity is a fundamental goal and we aim to create tools and services anyone can access and use. Someone's ability to pay for these tools or services should not be a determining factor in their ability to access and use them. Moreover, we do not restrict access to our tools unless access is superceded by our intent to make users more secure. We expect the code and research we publish will be reviewed and improved by many different people, and that is only possible if everyone has the ability to use, copy, modify, and redistribute this information. We also design, build, and deploy our tools without collecting identifiable information about our users.
4. We make Tor and related technologies ubiquitous through advocacy and education.
We are not just people who build software, but ambassadors for online freedom. We want everybody in the world to understand that their human rights -- particularly their rights to free speech, freedom to access information, and privacy -- can be preserved when they use the Internet. We teach people how and why to use Tor and we are always working to make our tools both more secure and more usable, which is why we use our own tools and listen to user feedback. Our vision of a more free society will not be accomplished simply behind a computer screen, and so in addition to writing good code, we also prioritize community outreach and advocacy.
5. We are honest about the capabilities and limits of Tor and related technologies.
We never intentionally mislead our users nor misrepresent the capabilities of the tools, nor the potential risks associated with using them. Every user should be free to make an informed decision about whether they should use a particular tool and how they should use it. We are responsible for accurately reporting the state of our software, and we work diligently to keep our community informed through our various communication channels.
6. We will never intentionally harm our users.
We take seriously the trust our users have placed in us. Not only will we always do our best to write good code, but it is imperative that we resist any pressure from adversaries who want to harm our users. We will never implement front doors or back doors into our projects. In our commitment to transparency, we are honest when we make errors, and we communicate with our users about our plans to improve.

Absolutely, it is all BS. Difference is, google isn’t really ‘aiming’ at the crowd that really gives a crap about such things, vs where TOR is. I myself am completely owned by google; gmail since beta, and a FI user for nearing 6 months. I know and understand that they know *everything* about my life, perhaps better than I do — I figure as long as that is acknowledged, c’est la vie.
It’s a tradeoff…
Seems like TOR isn’t marketing towards those willing to ‘make those tradeoffs’, especially since their entire ‘service/product’ is the vague notion of being ‘invisible’ online.
While both seem to be fucking you in the ass, google isn’t really lying to your face. Besides, evil is all in the mind of the beholder.
sigh. you want privacy? Keep it in your head; or at least, keep it off the inter-basket, where all our eggs seem to collect.

Not kidding; No one looked to google services for their privacy and protections, no? They subscribe to email, knowing they are read for ‘ads’, and knowing that no doubt, everything is logged and available at whatever ‘official’ request’. They look towards TOR for… almost the opposite. They *are* ‘selling’ protection.
Not meaningless at all; however, for *myself* the notion that TOR is screwing people over carries far more weight (and no surprise) than the notion of google screwing people over who were not explicitly seeking said ‘protections’.
*shrug*. Like you said, technology aside on the Micro level, the Macro level design of TOR provides ‘them’ all the protections with none of the liability. How others do not understand this is beyond my ‘scope’, if you will.

2. Open and transparent research and tools are key to our success.
We are committed to transparency; therefore, everything we release is open and our development happens in the open. Whenever feasible, we will continue to make our source code, binaries, and claims about them open to independent verification. In the extremely rare cases where open development would undermine the security of our users, we will be especially vigilant in our peer review by project members.
3. Our tools are free to access, use, adapt, and distribute.
The more diverse our users, the less is implied about any person by simply being a Tor user. This diversity is a fundamental goal and we aim to create tools and services anyone can access and use. Someone's ability to pay for these tools or services should not be a determining factor in their ability to access and use them. Moreover, we do not restrict access to our tools unless access is superceded by our intent to make users more secure. We expect the code and research we publish will be reviewed and improved by many different people, and that is only possible if everyone has the ability to use, copy, modify, and redistribute this information. We also design, build, and deploy our tools without collecting identifiable information about our users.
4. We make Tor and related technologies ubiquitous through advocacy and education.
We are not just people who build software, but ambassadors for online freedom. We want everybody in the world to understand that their human rights -- particularly their rights to free speech, freedom to access information, and privacy -- can be preserved when they use the Internet. We teach people how and why to use Tor and we are always working to make our tools both more secure and more usable, which is why we use our own tools and listen to user feedback. Our vision of a more free society will not be accomplished simply behind a computer screen, and so in addition to writing good code, we also prioritize community outreach and advocacy.
5. We are honest about the capabilities and limits of Tor and related technologies.
We never intentionally mislead our users nor misrepresent the capabilities of the tools, nor the potential risks associated with using them. Every user should be free to make an informed decision about whether they should use a particular tool and how they should use it. We are responsible for accurately reporting the state of our software, and we work diligently to keep our community informed through our various communication channels.
6. We will never intentionally harm our users.
We take seriously the trust our users have placed in us. Not only will we always do our best to write good code, but it is imperative that we resist any pressure from adversaries who want to harm our users. We will never implement front doors or back doors into our projects. In our commitment to transparency, we are honest when we make errors, and we communicate with our users about our plans to improve.

Absolutely, it is all BS. Difference is, google isn’t really ‘aiming’ at the crowd that really gives a crap about such things, vs where TOR is. I myself am completely owned by google; gmail since beta, and a FI user for nearing 6 months. I know and understand that they know *everything* about my life, perhaps better than I do — I figure as long as that is acknowledged, c’est la vie.
It’s a tradeoff…
Seems like TOR isn’t marketing towards those willing to ‘make those tradeoffs’, especially since their entire ‘service/product’ is the vague notion of being ‘invisible’ online.
While both seem to be fucking you in the ass, google isn’t really lying to your face. Besides, evil is all in the mind of the beholder.

Not kidding; No one looked to google services for their privacy and protections, no? They subscribe to email, knowing they are read for ‘ads’, and knowing that no doubt, everything is logged and available at whatever ‘official’ request’. They look towards TOR for… almost the opposite. They *are* ‘selling’ protection.
Not meaningless at all; however, for *myself* the notion that TOR is screwing people over carries far more weight (and no surprise) than the notion of google screwing people over who were not explicitly seeking said ‘protections’.
*shrug*. Like you said, technology aside on the Micro level, the Macro level design of TOR provides ‘them’ all the protections with none of the liability. How others do not understand this is beyond my ‘scope’, if you will.

No worries, JUAN, they promise no backdoors… (I’m with you on your design stance, btw)
"The Tor Social Contract
Posted August 9th, 2016 by alison  in At The Tor Project, we make tools that help promote and protect the essential human rights of people everywhere. We have a set of guiding principles that make that possible, but for a long time, those principles were more or less unspoken. In order to ensure that project members build a Tor that reflects the commitment to our ideals, we've taken a cue from our friends at Debian and written the Tor Social Contract -- the set of principles that show who we are and why we make Tor.
Our social contract is a set of behaviors and goals: not just the promised results we want for our community, but the ways we seek to achieve them. We want to grow Tor by supporting and advancing these guidelines in the time we are working on Tor, while taking care not to undermine them in the rest of our time.
The principles can also be used to help recognize when people's actions or intents are hurting Tor. Some of these principles are established norms; things we've been doing every day for a long time; while others are more aspirational -- but all of them are values we want to live in public, and we hope they will make our future choices easier and more open. This social contract is one of several documents that define our community standards, so if you're looking for things that aren't here (e.g. something that might be in a code of conduct) bear in mind that they might exist, in a different document.
Social goals can be complex. If there is ever tension in the application of the following principles, we will always strive to place highest priority on the safety and freedom of any who would use the fruits of our endeavors. The social contract can also help us work through such tensions -- for example, there are times when we might have a need to use tools that are not completely open (contradicting point 2) but opening them would undermine our users' safety (contradicting point 6). Using such a tool should be weighed against how much it's needed to make our technologies usable (point 1). And if we do use such a tool, we must be honest about its capabilities and limits (point 5). Tor is not just software, but a labor of love produced by an international community of people devoted to human rights. This social contract is a promise from our internal community to the rest of the world, affirming our commitment to our beliefs. We are excited to present it to you.

any group of people that expresses the notion or intent to apply their policy on individuals, as there is no way each and every individual will align, or to be kind, perfectly align with said policies.
You cannot have a group of people that considers themselves ‘governing’ that a) isn’t the definition of a collective b) can prescribe said , er, ‘suggestions’ (read: alt-truth ‘laws’) that are to be followed but without violating the NAP.
It can’t happen. The anarchist doesn’t subscribe. Now, if said government doesn’t force these, again ‘suggestions’ onto said ‘anarchist who doesn’t subscribe’, this is wonderful. But the anarchist remains an anarchist, and the government isn’t governing beyond those who follow. What you’re effectively describing is… A different group of anarchists that align differently, and have gathered, and.. An anarchist is fine with this — But it certainly isn’t a notion of a government, a (however nationalistic / dictatorship to whatever minimalistic) centralized governing being. Between two people is okay; because that math is fucking possible. You cannot expect everyone in a ‘state or nation’ to subscribe to whatever agreement, voluntarily. You’re not suggesting as such. However, what I am suggesting is that if no coercion is present in these actions, of which I applaud, then this mystical government of voluntary actions isn’t a government at all ; It is a group of people agreeing to something; where others are free to not participate.
This government you speak of isn’t a government at all; It is a group of anarchists.
The notion of government simply cannot exist without coercive elements. Thereby, perhaps you’re a bit more ‘anarchist’ than you realize; Or perhaps you’ve mis-understood the notion of libertarian and THEIR PARTY.
My brain works fine, I assure you. I may occasionally use a slightly wrong term, or not quite get my point across because i’m responding in discourse mode, not ‘deep deep’ thought mode, or perhaps it’s all the beers , the exhaustion from working, and 2 small children, but it works, and I can fully recognize the break between ‘a government of any sort’ and anarchist, and start, deep, deep , deep into that abyss. It, in fact, stares back.
Sp, Mr bell, I implore you. Stop straddling the fence with these combo terms that will split you down the middle.
Do you believe in a group of people having ‘say’ over others, or do you not? A group of people who ‘abide by the NAP’ , and do not force their views upon others by any forceful means , well, that isn’t government at all. It’s a group of people, living their life, no matter whom subscribes. It’s a group of anarchists — Against government.

I was curious about your stance on this matter, actually. I happen to agree with you here; share the wealth away, if you wish… But forcing someone to belong to such an agreement seems so not anarchist at all — It is curious to me as to why so many ‘old tyme’ anarchists thought this way. For what it’s worth, my license plate reads: “Agorist”. I believe in it, and unlike so much writing, I believe the doing is what matters. One can only write so much. (Yes, I realize paying the state for such a plate is ironic, but it’s a double edged sword of irony, and it costs $25 a year for this pleasure…).
Juan, would you define yourself as ‘anarchist without adjectives’? The notion, and fact, that there are self proclaimed ‘minarchists’ makes me very very sad and confused indeed. Actually, the ‘party’ of libertarianism probably most aligns with this term, no? Core underlying insane problems here? a) minarchist. Uhhhh. b) everyone has their own pieces of the pie that they like; group them; guess what? Entire pie. So, useless functionally, and useless conceptually.
Yup. This is what I said in an earlier post, but far more succinct. If you or your group are not forcing beliefs on others who do not fully align, well, you ain’t no ‘government’, are ye?
Side note: I find it funny, amusing, depressing, and perhaps regretful that so many post from un-attributable accounts. This is my name; This is my domain; Domain is registered to the house in which I am sitting in, in which my children are sleeping.
Accountability in belief goes a long way.
