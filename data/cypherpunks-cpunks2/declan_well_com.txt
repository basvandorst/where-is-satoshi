Maybe you're right. Maybe this expansion of warrantless surveillance powers is unobjectionable. Maybe the FBI and the state law enforcement agencies that will be able to legally use Carnivore without a court order in some circumstances will prove entirely trustworthy. Maybe they truly do need this power in emergencies. Maybe it'll even stop some terrorists. Maybe you're correct to say, "What's the big deal?"

And then there was this, which I wrote 2.5 years ago. Some folks,

In my opinion, everything should be left to the market to solve, and nothing
to politicians. I'd agree with you about the courts if they were private.
