@_subject: new idea for random number generation 
Dne 4. 8. 2017 v 18:24 Izaac napsal(a):
To better understanding. The description of the random number should be
as long as the random number. The algorithm can be considered as one of
random number descriptions. Therefore, any number generated by RNG
algorithm and longer than the algorithm description can not be
considered as random. This number can only be considered as pseudo-random.
John von Neumann has right. Questions are almost simple.
Do we use random number? Probably no.  We using CSPRNG, which is, based
on our knowledge, closest to the random as much as possible.
Can we test randomness? We can say almost yes. But better maybe.
Can this affect cryptography? Maybe. Better - weak RNG will affect it.
But we not sure how much difference make the good and perfect RNG.
Can we generate random number? Maybe, using TRNG.
And, the hardest one. What is exactly mean random number? Can choosing
of numbers without any relations between them provide for us enought
randomnes? How much of perfect random signal can be? This can lead to
one crazy question - if the perfect random will be a small subset, can
we be in risk use one of them?
Lot of people do hard work understanding, what is it random. How we test
random. How we detect random. And, how we can use random. We all enjoy
their hard work.

Hi Zenaan,
first, you sleep for a long time. Czechoslovakia has been almost 25
years ago, Czech has Zeman and Slovak has Kiska ;o))
Yes, he is a Czech president, but there are half of people hate him and
half of people love him. There are quite similar to US, because there
are no chance to choose between politicians, no diference between evils.
Around the world, nobody trust politicians.
Regards his statemement, it is hard to agree. I do not trust him, do not
trust his arguments, but there are few questions:
- who can defend me better, than me? Do I need trust to police (serve
the state - in extension politicians, which I don't trust)?
- can I trust the politicians, which take care about stole as much from
taxes as possible?
- do I need to trust state, where politicaly correctness has much higher
value than truth?
- can I trust the multiculturalism? My experience, 10% of different
peple like to cooperate doesn't mean change. But 10% of people, who
don't like to participate on common values are on the edge, what culture
accept (i don't know the time scale, after those 10% can be assimilated,
may one generation). I haven't any problem with white, black, nerdy,
pink, yellow or what you want of collor, religion, habbits. But what I
would like to stay in the mantinels of our culture. This mean - do what
do you want, but don't hurt other people.
- what is mean term multiculturalism? Culture are something, which bind
together people from the same place. Means history, culture, religion,
habbits. There are the issue. You can assimilate some percentage of
others, can be good. But in case that you cross the edge, can probably
destroy the society and empty space for the new one.
Lot of changes incoming. In the society, robotics, AI, which will have
impact of labor market. Massive surveilance, which will have destructive
impact on economy, social binds and also privacy. Global corporativism,
which destroy resorces and poison rest, could destroy the ecology.
Multiculturalism, which could be god as bad, but not only advance, also
can destroy our culture. We will see. And lot of questions incoming -
what we want, what we can do and what we need to do ... I can continue
This mean, czech president are populist. But we need to think about
problems seriously.

@_subject: Cryptography national rules and freedom 
I would like to apologize for this e-mail, may you can help me. Because
I collecting detailed data about national restriction of cryptography
(under term cryptography I mean software, hardware, devices, algorithm -
almost everything), could you take a look on questions bellow? Do any of
you have answer of those questions? You can contact me directly or by
this mailing list.
1) What is name of national authority responsible for cryptography and
computer security and could you provide their web pages?
2) Do national authority do restriction/recommendation for cryptography
used and is this recommendation available on web?
3) Do you have cybernetic law or its equivalent (EU2015/1535)? This mean
any law, describing critical and important infrastructure, recommended
rules and responsibility.
4) Can person do develop, personal use, sell or buy cryptography? Do you
have a restriction/recommendation in law? Can you provide me link to
this law?
5) Can private organization do develop, use, sell or buy cryptography?
Do you have a restriction/recommendation in law? Can you provide me link
to this law?
6) Can state organization do developing, use, sell or buy cryptography?
Do you have a restriction/recommendation in law? Can you provide me link
to this law?
7) Do your country have any other restrictions related to cryptography,
like penalizing of VPN usage, prohibiting secure messengers … and so on?
Also, in case that you have friend around Europe, mainly from EU (28
states), EU cooperative (16 states) or NATO (29 states), their response
will be welcome also. I plan to create map, describing cryptography
freedom mainly in Europe. Also, list of contacts for national authority,
related laws and basic rules. In case that you have any points about, do
not hesitate and please contact me. Comments are welcome. I have been
inspired by map created by Bert-Jaap Koops on
 but this map has been updated in
2013 last time. More, this map needs more details.

Bad deal. This kind of HW RNG will decrease amount of randomness in
relation of half-life. Also, radionuclides create lot of another
problems. Better to use quantum based RNGs, which will have the same
amount of properties for a long time. Nuclear fision are only one of
possible source with quantum properties. There are also noise of
amplificators, fotoelectric effect, Schottky noise ... Much more
efficient and much safer for use. More, better to follow regular testing
on random number generator based on BSI BSI AIS 2.0/3.1 than the NIST
