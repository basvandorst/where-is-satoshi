@_subject: Hacker Culture, Education, Empowerment/Emancipation 
Good Morning,
I'm Alex, from São Paulo - Brazil, teacher and part of some groups and
projects that aims to bring the hacker culture to the schools and
connect schools with the hacker communities...
Two years ago i started my phd work, trying to understand the relations
between hacker culture and an education to empowerment/emancipation.
Part of my efforts now is to better understand how the hacker culture
have been lived (and helped people) around the world and in the
different movements and communities. I really want to have a broader and
heterogeneous view about this ...
I know many of you have experienced in collectives and communities very
strong aspects of the hacker culture, so, i would like to ask your help,
if possible, sharing your experiences and opinions. We created a
questionnaire to try to capture these different views. The link is
 ... It would be
great to have your perceptions!
For those who have some interest on this, ping us and let's be in touch!
Thank you so much!
