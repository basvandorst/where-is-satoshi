@_subject: COIN: How To 
I was gifted some altcoin by a friend to pay for drinks a while back
and would like to exchange it for local fiat, it's ~$50.
How do I do so?  What is best, irl exchange, equal value purchase,
bank transfer, or sudo bank transfer with something like bitpay? How
do I deal with taxes?  I am in the States.
What suggestions and resources do you have to share?
