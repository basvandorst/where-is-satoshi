Hello Cypherpunks!
As many of you will likely know, Microsoft has recently made public a
release date for Windows 10 and has been testing the platform as part of
the "Windows Insider" program. With this update comes a number of
seemingly unoriginal [1], but nonetheless interesting features, such as
"Cortana", Windows' "truly personal" assistant (only to be available in
a handful of countries) and "Windows Hello", a biometric authentication
system allowing the use of the face, iris, or finger for access [2].
What changes in Windows' security are expected to take place? Will
systems such as Windows Hello leak uniquely identifiable biometric data,
despite a planned increase in security [3]? What could perhaps be done
to limit the risk of using systems such as a cloud-based, personal
assistant that is able to access most of a person's internet-connected
Thankyou very much,
[1] It seems that Windows 10's flagship features such as biometric
authentication have already been available on a number of other
platforms for quite some time, not to mention the fact that the name
"Cortana" was used as the name for an artificial intelligence character
in the popular "Halo" game series (The name seems to be have been used
without violating intellectual property laws, as Halo, having been
originally developed by Bungie, Inc. is now a subsidiary of Microsoft

Windows 10 release date can be found at the following link:

Confusing the absolute "truth" with "moral values" would indeed pose a
tricky dilemma in the situation of Vladimir Putin. If you consider Putin
to be unilaterally upholding the truth whilst at the same time upholding
moral values, such a position would be rapidly contradicted when
comparing Putin's attitude towards the right of LGBT people to exist to
that of the West, considering of course that by "moral values", Putin
indeed upholds basic human rights.
Indeed, the torture and killings perpetrated by Putin's lower levels of
government and covered from up high, a fact of life that comes with
having been a member of the soviet union, must definitely reflect upon
Putin's willingness to publicize the truth, whether it would be in his
country's (capitalist) interest.
Furthermore, Putin's involvement against ISIS (or Daesh, for those who
prefer it) is but another part of Putin's manipulation for influence in
the middle east, tying in with involvement in Ukraine, games with NATO
and economic sanctions placed against Russia by the western world.
I strongly doubt that Putin's actions are not motivated by money and the
so-called "benefits" that come with setting up a slew of back room
agreements between countries. Instead, agreements promoting corruption
and the oppression of free speech are mainly set up with non-western
countries, reducing the ability for western media to catch a hold of
them and call Putin out, a result of the more secretive systems of
government that tend to exist in the East.
Although the problem of political corruption and the utter inability of
any political party to avoid completely sacrificing any hope of measly
integrity is primarily associated with the West, Eastern governments are
not exempt. It is not that such problems are isolated to a particular
section of the world, but instead cover the globe itself.
Oh yes, considering that the citizens of South Ossetia, Abkhazia and
Crimea are not Putin's own people.
Given Putin's partial invasion of Georgia and the Ukraine, it would be
ludicrous to believe that he is acting in the interests of the Georgian
and Ukrainian people. Russia's actions, although in his eyes quite
likely reflect an act of protection by Russia, are solely motivated by
economic or military reasoning, furthering Russia's troublesome
influence in an already unstable region.
It must be kept in mind that although Russia may have a tendency to cut
through the grime that obscures Western policy making, Russia (and
thereby Vladimir Putin) is not exempt from the corruption evident in
today's world by cause of modern capitalist and nationalistic sentiment.
I truly hope that the belief that Putin is an "unambiguous and
consistent friend to the truth" is but pure satire, intended to spark a
lively debate.

Hello Zenaan,
I'm afraid that Islam, and Islamic ideology, although undoubtedly
founded in the midst of violence and chaos and closely linked to quite
violent and bloody wars throughout much of history, is not a violent
Texts in the Qur'an, as in the bible, promote and glorify the violence
of it's followers when perceived in the context of historic events. Such
is the nature of holy texts, advocating the victory of their followers
in battle over the followers of other religions pertaining to foreign
To say that Islam is a violent religion by referencing battles that
occurred hundreds of years ago completely negliges the positions members
of other religions and faiths, such as Christians, took throughout the
course of history.
Christian movements such as the crusades and the idea of spreading
religion through missionaries to be a noble act caused damage in the
same way that Islamic movements did by conquering swathes of land in
order to spread their ideology and economic power. Such a comparison
clearly reflects the nature of religions based on interpretative
scripture without so much as delving into the violence caused as a
result of more modern colonialism, closely linked with Christian
ideology and capitalism.
An even more modern example of tragedy motivated by religious
interpretation is that of Australia's "stolen generations", where, by
means of the Christian religion, Australian society itself separated up
to 30% of indigenous children from their families.
Evidently, no religion is immune to acts of violence perpetrated in the
name of religion or "protection of religion", taking as an example the
persistent Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where Judaism and the fear of
Jewish people being oppressed is used as an excuse for the colonization
of Palestinian territory.
To blindly accuse "Islam" as the root of all violence perpetrated by
those proclaiming to be of Islamic faith is a broad and particularly
callous generalization, especially when addressing the issue of
immigration. Regardless of one's religion, if a person is conditioned to
react with violence, violence will ensue. Preventing any group of people
based on their faith from immigrating to a country is simply
discrimination issuing from a stereotype propagated by members of a
society acting out of fear. Instead of screening immigrants (refugees or
otherwise) based on their religion, it would be much more appropriate to
screen for signs that a person may attempt to perpetrate or incite violence.
Australia is not facing a crisis. Rather, the Australian government is
facing a particularly tough issue of generalization and
misrepresentation within Australian borders.
I hope that Australia will not succumb to the fear and hatred of Muslim
people so often preached by those able to benefit from it.

@_subject: Fwd: New High School Principal's speech to students. 
Hello Zenaan,
Wouldn't it be nice if we all lived in a world without racism? A world
without prejudice based on ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation?
Prejudice and racism propagate in locations where people are not exposed
to other cultures and taught to look outward towards the world in view
of peace and tolerance. Banning cultural, national or ethnic
celebrations creates an environment where only one cultural outlook is
valued and respected, contributing to the idea that all other cultures
should be shunned and dismissed. This is the essence of racism and
intolerance, founded in ignorance and lack of outward perception.
Open clubs created in order to promote understanding of differing
cultures and people belonging to different minorities, said to "divide
students" in the speech you have so relevantly and tactfully distributed
among this mailing list, aid in supporting a message of tolerance and
acceptance of diversity to the point where they may form the core of a
school's strategy against racism. Banning or otherwise dismantling such
clubs would further reduce opportunities for a school's students to
engage with other cultures and develop a wider perspective that takes
into account the differences of all people in this world.
Furthermore, allowing some classes, designed to cater for international
students, to proceed in a language other than English, is critical in
fostering an environment where students from other cultures are welcome
and able to learn alongside students that are typically considered
"ethnically Australian". Failing to foster such an environment not only
results in an ethnically homogenous school population, characterized by
strong opinions against diversity, but also tears down the advances in
tolerance and global thinking put forward by programs such as open
school clubs and cultural celebrations.
In today's connected age, where it is not longer important, but
essential, to be able to interact with and understand those from
differing cultures and geographic locations, neglecting the importance
of cultural awareness is not only failing to prepare a school's students
for a better future, the main goal of all education, but also resorting
to an incredibly outdated and naive view of education that has primarily
been demonstrated in centuries past, where the purpose of school, as it
used to be, was to equip students with the skills necessary, and only
the skills necessary, to carry out a repetitive task known as their
"job", mandated by a central power.
It seems that the narrator of the speech you have posted deems such an
"education" to be the end goal of all schooling, clearly demonstrated by
their adamant insistence in ensuring that all students are to compete on
the "Australian job market", rather than adopting a more modern
perspective that acknowledges the existence of a global, or at the very
least, international, potential for employment.
Finally, the drive and commitment to an Australian national identity, so
fervently expressed by the narrator, fails to take into account that
Australia's national identity relies on a global perspective to provide
cohesiveness within Australian society and that "Australian culture", as
understood by the majority of Australian residents, is rather
superficial to the point where Australia is deemed "primarily
culture-less", relying instead on a strong attachment to multiculturalism.
I truly hope that you did not mean "your kinda speech" to be one of
intolerance and prejudice, similar to the speeches supported by and

Rather, I am optimistic of the idea that you have posted such a speech
as a result of a desire to take the point of view of a devil's advocate
and are indeed seeking a better world, one where racism, prejudice and
intolerance are notions of the past.
All the best,

Hello Zenaan,
Wouldn't it be nice if we all lived in a world without racism? A world
without prejudice based on ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation?
Prejudice and racism propagate in locations where people are not exposed
to other cultures and taught to look outward towards the world in view
of peace and tolerance. Banning cultural, national or ethnic
celebrations creates an environment where only one cultural outlook is
valued and respected, contributing to the idea that all other cultures
should be shunned and dismissed. This is the essence of racism and
intolerance, founded in ignorance and lack of outward perception.
Open clubs created in order to promote understanding of differing
cultures and people belonging to different minorities, said to "divide
students" in the speech you have so relevantly and tactfully distributed
among this mailing list, aid in supporting a message of tolerance and
acceptance of diversity to the point where they may form the core of a
school's strategy against racism. Banning or otherwise dismantling such
clubs would further reduce opportunities for a school's students to
engage with other cultures and develop a wider perspective that takes
into account the differences of all people in this world.
Furthermore, allowing some classes, designed to cater for international
students, to proceed in a language other than English, is critical in
fostering an environment where students from other cultures are welcome
and able to learn alongside students that are typically considered
"ethnically Australian". Failing to foster such an environment not only
results in an ethnically homogenous school population, characterized by
strong opinions against diversity, but also tears down the advances in
tolerance and global thinking put forward by programs such as open
school clubs and cultural celebrations.
In today's connected age, where it is not longer important, but
essential, to be able to interact with and understand those from
differing cultures and geographic locations, neglecting the importance
of cultural awareness is not only failing to prepare a school's students
for a better future, the main goal of all education, but also resorting
to an incredibly outdated and naive view of education that has primarily
been demonstrated in centuries past, where the purpose of school, as it
used to be, was to equip students with the skills necessary, and only
the skills necessary, to carry out a repetitive task known as their
"job", mandated by a central power.
It seems that the narrator of the speech you have posted deems such an
"education" to be the end goal of all schooling, clearly demonstrated by
their adamant insistence in ensuring that all students are to compete on
the "Australian job market", rather than adopting a more modern
perspective that acknowledges the existence of a global, or at the very
least, international, potential for employment.
Finally, the drive and commitment to an Australian national identity, so
fervently expressed by the narrator, fails to take into account that
Australia's national identity relies on a global perspective to provide
cohesiveness within Australian society and that "Australian culture", as
understood by the majority of Australian residents, is rather
superficial to the point where Australia is deemed "primarily
culture-less", relying instead on a strong attachment to multiculturalism.
I truly hope that you did not mean "your kinda speech" to be one of
intolerance and prejudice, similar to the speeches supported by and
created in the interests of nazi and neo-nazi supporters or parties.
