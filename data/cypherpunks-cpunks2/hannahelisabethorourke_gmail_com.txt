Hi all! Hope you’re all safe and isolated - I found this, seems to be the
best resource for organising efforts around Coronavirus:
All the data and graphs you could ever want, tips for remote working, tools
for organising mutual aid groups, and crowdsourced specialist advice for
doctors, teachers, charities, all kinds of things. Have a look.
