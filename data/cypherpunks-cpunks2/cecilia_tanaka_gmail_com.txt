Link to Trailer: Hope you are well! Been a long time :-)
I'm making movies to teach the world more about Aaron Swartz and to help
the public better understand whistleblowers and whistleblower upload
I wanted to let you know about my little Kickstarter campaign for a movie I
am producing independently, "From DeadDrop to SecureDrop" - it's about
"SecureDrop," an anonymous upload system for whistleblowers that Aaron
prototyped with Kevin Poulsen, one month before his death, that connects
directly to news organizations (such as the Washington Post, Forbes, and
The New Yorker):
Here's a Tweet about it, if you're short on time:
Please help fund "From DeadDrop to SecureDrop" and help more potential
Whistleblowers learn about  I'm including a description of the project below! It's only going on for 4
more days, and I only have about $5,000 of the $20,000 I'm trying to raise,
so any help -- or also Tweets and social media love would be greatly
Thanks! :)
Much love,
The film is entitled "From DeadDrop to SecureDrop," and provides a
historical account of how the "SecureDrop" open source anonymous
whistleblowing submission platform was originally prototyped by Kevin
Poulsen and Aaron Swartz, and later, after Aaron's death, how it made its
way its current home at the Freedom of the Press Foundation.
People in the film (so far) include: Wired's Kevin Poulsen (how he was
inspired by WikiLeaks and then convinced Aaron to work with him on the
project), Trevor Timm and John Perry Barlow (of the Freedom of the Press
Foundation), who sought out the DeadDrop prototype, Garrett Robinson
(SecureDrop's current Development Lead) and Bill Budington (an EFF engineer
who worked directly on the early codebase), and some influential figures
familiar with the issues, such as Brewster Kahle (Founder of the Internet
Archive and co-founder, with myself, of Aaron Swartz Day) and Cindy Cohn
(Executive Director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation). I also
interviewed Virgil Griffith (Tor2Web and Wikiscanner), as he and Aaron were
good friends and worked on Tor2Web together.
Jacob Applebaum has agreed to be interviewed for the film. (Besides being a
WikiLeaks volunteer, he was good friends with Aaron.) Also, Sarah Harrison,
who stood by Edward Snowden's side in Hong Kong and the Moscow airport, and
assisted with getting him safe asylum in Russia, has agreed to be in the

I came to realize that the film really needs to expand beyond the subject
of the SecureDrop technology itself, to attempt to explain *why* these
whistleblowers might decide to use WikiLeaks or SecureDrop to expose
corruption in the first place: To inform the public and make the world a
better place. I realize this sounds simple and obvious, but I don't think
that most people are actually aware of this. Here's a post explaining how
Ed Snowden chose the Constitution over a Non-Disclosure agreement, when he
decided to blow the whistle: A third theme of the movie deals directly with an observation made by more
than one of the people I interviewed for the film, about how SecureDrop
will "help the next Ed Snowden" communicate with Journalists safely (so no
one will have to go through what he went through, just to get a story out).
The film suggests that SecureDrop could potentially usher in a new
generation of whistleblower: One that won't necessarily have to put their
whole life at risk, in order to "do the right thing."

Juan dear,
Instead arguing with you about vocabulary, real meaning of some words or
not, limits of some concepts, gender equality, men and women, storks and
babies, I decided asking for help and avoid a possible gaffe or being
unfair with you.  :P
I was thinking about asking you some suggestions of good anarchist
readings, because I made some searches and  - wow! -  the bibliography is
really huge.  I need some help to separate the wheat from the shaft,
please.  Or a guide "Advanced Anarchism for Dummies".  I know only the baby
steps, sorry.  :(
I asked Steve some suggestions in private, but it's better to ask publicly,
so more people can profit the clues.  Oh, you know, he loves books, uses
cute emoticons and makes oink oink.  He's a good reference for me,
hahaha!!  ;)

Hi Cari!  Hi Bastiani!  :D
Thank you very much for the kind suggestions!  <3
I was writing an answer to Juan, talking about 'sexism' and feminism, but
decided to search about the relations about anarchism, feminism and also
sexism.  I've found several references and different concepts, some of them
a bit confuse and contraditory.
So, it would be unfair to say Juan was wrong.  Some writers think he's
right, but some anarcha-feminists say the 'sexism' really exists and use
this exact word in their texts.  :P
After some reading, I thought it would be more logical to understand the
anarchism decently, before analyzing its relations with feminism and,
maybe, with 'sexism'.  Mental masturbation takes additional time, but is
always fun, hihi!  :)
I've found different definitions of 'sexism' on internet and, being
sincere, I thought some of them are so 'sexist' as the prejudice that they
want to avoid.  There are some good, reasonable definitions, but most of
them were very frustrating.  Meh!  Better to study a bit more and have my
own personal beliefs.  :P
Lots of thankful little kisses, muuaaah!!!  :*

@_subject: Remember, remember Hiroshima? 
I suggest to watch "Grave of the Fireflies", if someone wish to pay tribute
to Hiroshima in a different way.
It's beautiful and sensible, but also one of the saddest 'anime'  (Japanese
animated movies/series)  that I saw in my whole life.
Not for being Japanese, not for showing the Second World War, but because
it shows the point of view of  children.  Children starving, crying, losing
their parents and dying without ever understanding the war.
In all the wars, what always worries me the most are the children, their
traums.  They don't have any guilt and always suffer all the pain.
Sorry, I didn't find the animated movie with English subtitles on line,
just the trailer.  It's the kind of story so disturbing, so intensely sad
that you can watch only once in your life.  I, probably, was not brave
enough in my searches, pardon.

@_subject: Die Zeit interviews Appelbaum ioerror 
All the times when I read River, I remember it's a pseudonym very used in
sites of sex stories about BDSM or to contact eventual sexual partners.
The same about Rain, Forest and other nicknames like these.  I don't know
if it was just a coincidence, a bad joke or if it is their nature, their
sexual preference.
Well, usually, a vanilla person would not choose this kind of pseudonym,
but I really don't care about their sexual practices.  I just think it's
very fun see chaste, immaculate, innocent vanilla people using hardcore
BDSM nicks.  Really hypocrite, considering that Jake, in some moments, was
judged for his sexuality, not for his character.
I am late with some really important answers, but as I told to a contact
some days later, and repeated to another person today, Jake always
respected me and all my female friends a lot, acting like a real gentleman
and, believe me, some of them are beautiful women and tried to flirt with
him hardly.  :P
He was a very handsome, charismatic, sexy, famous, intelligent man, walking
among lots of all kinds of activists, men and women, in several events
around the whole world.  Very glamorous.  Becoming one of his lovers or
girlfriends was a way of increasing social status, so he really refused a
lot of crazy invasive people to avoid problems and being related to these
people.  He could have sex very easily, in all the places and parties,
without "raping" someone.
I saw it happening in person.  He was very professional and gentle,
refusing more intimate contacts in a polite and discreet way.  He rejected
one of my personal friends in a Brazilian event and she is a young
intelligent woman, much more beautiful and interesting than me.  It is
strange for a 'serial rapist', a crazy psychopath, isn't it?  :-/
Well, let's wait to discover what will happen.  There are lots of things
that simply don't make sense in all this drama.  It would not be rational
or reasonable.
Kisses and hugs for all of you!  :*  <3
PS:  -  Ah, a silly curiosity!  One of "Rivers" liked a lot to write about
incest and bestiality, hardcore taboo themes in general, but I really liked
her writing style, so I tried to contact her to ask about the choice of her
I never received an answer, but it was an interesting experience.  I think
this River in special is a girl, not a guy, and she is very intelligent.
Their stories are very disturbing  -  too 'eeck!!!' for my taste, ugh!  -,
but are intelligent and she got some archetypical desires, with subtle
references to Greek legends.  She is not a stupid girl trying to get
audience.  (Different of the j.a. group members' initial pattern, haha!!)
Well, sex with animals is not vegan, but all the people are animals and I
suppose her "lovers", if really exist, receive a good treatment.  ;)

Being vegan is very fun for lighthearted trolls.  I can use it as excuse
for everything and always will be people thinking I am talking seriously.
Currently, I am saying to some friends that hunting pokémons is not vegan
at all, hahaha!!  ;D
Personally I don't hold much hope for humanity..I figure the solution to
Fermis paradox is self-evident. We are going to fucking destroy ourselves.
Live it up while you can ;)
While the end doesn't arrive, I was reading a bit about Victoria Woodhull
[1] and cute soldering kits.  I really appreciated to learn a bit more
about her.  Great girl, wow!  :D
Yep, thinking about the future can be very depressing, but it's fun to
think about all the possibilities.  I really think technology and goodwill
can make a better world for everybody and  - wow! -  there are lots of
interesting, amazing people in the whole world.
Being alive is still fun, even when everything makes no sense.  Life is
very crazy in some moments.
Now, I was trying to mention a Hardy Har Har quote to make you laugh and
discovered the eternal pessimist hyena is more bitter and depressive in the
Brazilian version, haha!!  ;D
It's funnier, much more dramatic, but was strange to discover how much the
translations can adapt or modify the original talks.  Here the hyena always
complains "I know it won't work...  Oh Heavens!  Oh day!  Oh bad luck!"
instead "Oh me, oh my, oh dear"...   :P
This kind of unexpected fun thing keeps me alive and my mood, more or less,
good.  You know, life is a bitch and sucks, but, in some moments, it is
very expensive, dramatic and doesn't suck well.  ;)
In any case, there are lots of good people and wonderful music in the
world.  And children.  Children always are the hope for a better future!  <3
Tender kisses, warm hugs and lots of hope!  :*

Jake always considered himself a queer, bisexual man.  It was part of his
"problems" when he was publicly judged for his sexuality.  A lot of
moralist, hypocrite people judging his gender, his sexual preferences, not
his character, his real acts.
I've "lost" a "friend", because she said "Jake certainly raped these
people, once he was promiscuous enough to have sexual intercourses with
both genders".
So much prejudice, aff...  Very disgusting.  Judge a person for their
gender and for their sexuality is very stupid.

gender and for their sexuality is very stupid.
that the community has a double standard. That people like Jake who act
male (even if they're gay or bisexual) get lynched. But people who are just
as promiscuous, but act female or androgynous, get a pass. They get to be
I got your point, my love, but I do try to refuse this kind of social
condescension, all these labels.  I am not weaker for being a woman.  I am
not a victim.  And yes, I think it's very disgusting when a person uses
their gender to get benefits.  And yes again, it was very depressing,
really unfair and nocive to see how some people managed their labels
against a "white North American man", being he really guilty or not.  :((
This kind of fake situation creates more prejudice, and more stupid labels,
and more and more social judgements.  The real victims of rape, of all
kinds of brutality and harassment, will lose their credibility, because of
stupid fucking liars and it's sad, unfair, wrong and very, very hurtful for
real victims!  :((
In the other side, I already told you I have transgender friends and make
volunteer work in LGBTQ groups, my love.  There are much hate and
intolerance against them.  It's really hard.
There is so much prejudice against them that it's really hard to discover
the limits between true prejudice or not.  Even working with them, in some
moments, involuntarily, I make horrible gaffes.  :(
Once, I was explaining that a female trans friend was born a man and was
waiting for her hormonal treatment and another trans friend said it was
very offensive for everybody, because my friend always was a woman, since
her birth.  She was not born a man.  I was talking about chromosomes,
genetics only, but I hurt a friend involuntarily.  :(((
Do you understand how hard is having sensibility enough to avoid hurting
fragile people, my love?  So, be careful, please.  Love you!  :*

Thank you for all who sent me musics in private.  It was very sweet!  <3
I love music.  It warms my heart and  - wow! -  there are zillions of
beautiful musics in the world that I never heard before.  :D
Sorry, I confess I asked for "help" just to renew a bit my soundtrack,
haha!  ;)
A beautiful music to wish you all an excellent day!  <3
I really love Ed Sheeran's cover of Bob Dylan's protest song "Masters of
War".  The lyrics are very powerful, really beautiful and intense.  I love
this song.
"Masters Of War"  (Bob Dylan)
Come you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks.
You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly.
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain.
You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion'
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud.
You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins.
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do.
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul.
And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead.

Uff...  Some months ago, I would be happy.  Now, it means nothing...  :((
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Hi all,
We are pleased to accounce that Tor Browser 6.0.4 is ready for testing.
Bundles can be found on:
This release finally brings Tor Browser users the latest Tor stable,
0.2.8.6, and avoids pinging Mozilla servers for system extensions.
The latter was responsible for users getting an extension into their Tor
Browser that resulted in annoying and confusing "Your Firefox is out of
date" notifications on start-up (bug 19890). Thanks to Mozilla engineers
who fixed that issue as fast as possible on their side: the extension is
not shipped to Tor Browser users anymore if they ping Mozilla's server.
Users that are on the alpha channel or are using the hardened Tor
Browser were not affected. The same goes for Tails users as far as we know.
The full changelog since Tor Browser 6.0.3 is:
Tor Browser 6.0.4 -- August 16
 * All Platforms
   * Update Tor to 0.2.8.6
   * Update NoScript to 2.9.0.14
   * Bug 19890: Disable installation of system addons

​It's a list about tecnology and security, but also about people, my dear.
There are lots of places where people disappear when offending the wrong

in the wrong time, and it's very unfair.
That's the reason why this list is important.  Here, you will learn more
resources to become anonymous and survive in a world where privacy is
dying.​  There are lots of political discussions, jokes, discussions, but
there is space to teach and to learn too.  You just need to ask for help or

Give this list a chance and help it to be better.  If you want more
technical content, you can post it and it certainly will be good for a lot
of people.  Lots of different points of view can make a more accurate

Juan dear,
Instead arguing with you about vocabulary, real meaning of some words or

babies, I decided asking for help and avoid a possible gaffe or being
unfair with you.  :P
I was thinking about asking you some suggestions of good anarchist
readings, because I made some searches and  - wow! -  the bibliography is
really huge.  I need some help to separate the wheat from the shaft,
please.  Or a guide "Advanced Anarchism for Dummies".  I know only the baby

Hi Cari!  Hi Bastiani!  :D
Thank you very much for the kind suggestions!  <3
I was writing an answer to Juan, talking about 'sexism' and feminism, but
decided to search about the relations about anarchism, feminism and also
sexism.  I've found several references and different concepts, some of them
a bit confuse and contraditory.
So, it would be unfair to say Juan was wrong.  Some writers think he's
right, but some anarcha-feminists say the 'sexism' really exists and use
this exact word in their texts.  :P
After some reading, I thought it would be more logical to understand the
anarchism decently, before analyzing its relations with feminism and,
maybe, with 'sexism'.  Mental masturbation takes additional time, but is
always fun, hihi!  :)
I've found different definitions of 'sexism' on internet and, being
sincere, I thought some of them are so 'sexist' as the prejudice that they
want to avoid.  There are some good, reasonable definitions, but most of
them were very frustrating.  Meh!  Better to study a bit more and have my
own personal beliefs.  :P

I suggest to watch "Grave of the Fireflies", if someone wish to pay tribute
to Hiroshima in a different way.
It's beautiful and sensible, but also one of the saddest 'anime'  (Japanese
animated movies/series)  that I saw in my whole life.
Not for being Japanese, not for showing the Second World War, but because
it shows the point of view of  children.  Children starving, crying, losing
their parents and dying without ever understanding the war.
In all the wars, what always worries me the most are the children, their
traums.  They don't have any guilt and always suffer all the pain.
Sorry, I didn't find the animated movie with English subtitles on line,
just the trailer.  It's the kind of story so disturbing, so intensely sad
that you can watch only once in your life.  I, probably, was not brave

@_subject: Die Zeit interviews Appelbaum ioerror 
All the times when I read River, I remember it's a pseudonym very used in
sites of sex stories about BDSM or to contact eventual sexual partners.
The same about Rain, Forest and other nicknames like these.  I don't know
if it was just a coincidence, a bad joke or if it is their nature, their
sexual preference.
Well, usually, a vanilla person would not choose this kind of pseudonym,
but I really don't care about their sexual practices.  I just think it's
very fun see chaste, immaculate, innocent vanilla people using hardcore
BDSM nicks.  Really hypocrite, considering that Jake, in some moments, was
judged for his sexuality, not for his character.
I am late with some really important answers, but as I told to a contact
some days later, and repeated to another person today, Jake always
respected me and all my female friends a lot, acting like a real gentleman
and, believe me, some of them are beautiful women and tried to flirt with
him hardly.  :P
He was a very handsome, charismatic, sexy, famous, intelligent man, walking
among lots of all kinds of activists, men and women, in several events
around the whole world.  Very glamorous.  Becoming one of his lovers or
girlfriends was a way of increasing social status, so he really refused a
lot of crazy invasive people to avoid problems and being related to these
people.  He could have sex very easily, in all the places and parties,
without "raping" someone.
I saw it happening in person.  He was very professional and gentle,
refusing more intimate contacts in a polite and discreet way.  He rejected
one of my personal friends in a Brazilian event and she is a young
intelligent woman, much more beautiful and interesting than me.  It is
strange for a 'serial rapist', a crazy psychopath, isn't it?  :-/
Well, let's wait to discover what will happen.  There are lots of things
that simply don't make sense in all this drama.  It would not be rational
or reasonable.

incest and bestiality, hardcore taboo themes in general, but I really liked
her writing style, so I tried to contact her to ask about the choice of her
I never received an answer, but it was an interesting experience.  I think
this River in special is a girl, not a guy, and she is very intelligent.
Their stories are very disturbing  -  too 'eeck!!!' for my taste, ugh!  -,
but are intelligent and she got some archetypical desires, with subtle
references to Greek legends.  She is not a stupid girl trying to get
audience.  (Different of the j.a. group members' initial pattern, haha!!)
Well, sex with animals is not vegan, but all the people are animals and I
suppose her "lovers", if really exist, receive a good treatment.  ;)

Being vegan is very fun for lighthearted trolls.  I can use it as excuse
for everything and always will be people thinking I am talking seriously.
Currently, I am saying to some friends that hunting pokémons is not vegan
at all, hahaha!!  ;D
Personally I don't hold much hope for humanity..I figure the solution to
Fermis paradox is self-evident. We are going to fucking destroy ourselves.
Live it up while you can ;)
While the end doesn't arrive, I was reading a bit about Victoria Woodhull
[1] and cute soldering kits.  I really appreciated to learn a bit more
about her.  Great girl, wow!  :D
Yep, thinking about the future can be very depressing, but it's fun to
think about all the possibilities.  I really think technology and goodwill
can make a better world for everybody and  - wow! -  there are lots of
interesting, amazing people in the whole world.
Being alive is still fun, even when everything makes no sense.  Life is
very crazy in some moments.
Now, I was trying to mention a Hardy Har Har quote to make you laugh and
discovered the eternal pessimist hyena is more bitter and depressive in the
Brazilian version, haha!!  ;D
It's funnier, much more dramatic, but was strange to discover how much the
translations can adapt or modify the original talks.  Here the hyena always
complains "I know it won't work...  Oh Heavens!  Oh day!  Oh bad luck!"
instead "Oh me, oh my, oh dear"...   :P
This kind of unexpected fun thing keeps me alive and my mood, more or less,
good.  You know, life is a bitch and sucks, but, in some moments, it is
very expensive, dramatic and doesn't suck well.  ;)
In any case, there are lots of good people and wonderful music in the
world.  And children.  Children always are the hope for a better future!  <3
Tender kisses, warm hugs and lots of hope!  :*

Jake always considered himself a queer, bisexual man.  It was part of his
"problems" when he was publicly judged for his sexuality.  A lot of
moralist, hypocrite people judging his gender, his sexual preferences, not
his character, his real acts.
I've "lost" a "friend", because she said "Jake certainly raped these
people, once he was promiscuous enough to have sexual intercourses with
both genders".
So much prejudice, aff...  Very disgusting.  Judge a person for their

as promiscuous, but act female or androgynous, get a pass. They get to be
I got your point, my love, but I do try to refuse this kind of social
condescension, all these labels.  I am not weaker for being a woman.  I am
not a victim.  And yes, I think it's very disgusting when a person uses
their gender to get benefits.  And yes again, it was very depressing,
really unfair and nocive to see how some people managed their labels
against a "white North American man", being he really guilty or not.  :((
This kind of fake situation creates more prejudice, and more stupid labels,
and more and more social judgements.  The real victims of rape, of all
kinds of brutality and harassment, will lose their credibility, because of
stupid fucking liars and it's sad, unfair, wrong and very, very hurtful for
real victims!  :((
In the other side, I already told you I have transgender friends and make
volunteer work in LGBTQ groups, my love.  There are much hate and
intolerance against them.  It's really hard.
There is so much prejudice against them that it's really hard to discover
the limits between true prejudice or not.  Even working with them, in some
moments, involuntarily, I make horrible gaffes.  :(
Once, I was explaining that a female trans friend was born a man and was
waiting for her hormonal treatment and another trans friend said it was
very offensive for everybody, because my friend always was a woman, since
her birth.  She was not born a man.  I was talking about chromosomes,
genetics only, but I hurt a friend involuntarily.  :(((

fragile people, my love?  So, be careful, please.  Love you!  :*

I really love Ed Sheeran's cover of Bob Dylan's protest song "Masters of

"Masters Of War"  (Bob Dylan)
Come you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks.
You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly.
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain.
You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion'
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud.
You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins.
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do.
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul.
And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead.

Uff...  Some months ago, I would be happy.  Now, it means nothing...  :((
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Hi all,
We are pleased to accounce that Tor Browser 6.0.4 is ready for testing.
Bundles can be found on:
This release finally brings Tor Browser users the latest Tor stable,
0.2.8.6, and avoids pinging Mozilla servers for system extensions.
The latter was responsible for users getting an extension into their Tor
Browser that resulted in annoying and confusing "Your Firefox is out of
date" notifications on start-up (bug 19890). Thanks to Mozilla engineers
who fixed that issue as fast as possible on their side: the extension is
not shipped to Tor Browser users anymore if they ping Mozilla's server.
Users that are on the alpha channel or are using the hardened Tor
Browser were not affected. The same goes for Tails users as far as we know.
The full changelog since Tor Browser 6.0.3 is:
Tor Browser 6.0.4 -- August 16
 * All Platforms
   * Update Tor to 0.2.8.6
   * Update NoScript to 2.9.0.14
   * Bug 19890: Disable installation of system addons

​It's a list about tecnology and security, but also about people, my dear.
There are lots of places where people disappear when offending the wrong
person.  Sometimes, people disappear only because were in the wrong place,
in the wrong time, and it's very unfair.
That's the reason why this list is important.  Here, you will learn more
resources to become anonymous and survive in a world where privacy is
dying.​  There are lots of political discussions, jokes, discussions, but
there is space to teach and to learn too.  You just need to ask for help or
make searches in the archives.
Give this list a chance and help it to be better.  If you want more
technical content, you can post it and it certainly will be good for a lot
of people.  Lots of different points of view can make a more accurate
analisys of qualities and/or deffects in programs, ideas, whatever.  :)

Juan dear,
Instead arguing with you about vocabulary, real meaning of some words or
not, limits of some concepts, gender equality, men and women, storks and
babies, I decided asking for help and avoid a possible gaffe or being
unfair with you.  :P
I was thinking about asking you some suggestions of good anarchist
readings, because I made some searches and  - wow! -  the bibliography is
really huge.  I need some help to separate the wheat from the shaft,
please.  Or a guide "Advanced Anarchism for Dummies".  I know only the baby
steps, sorry.  :(
I asked Steve some suggestions in private, but it's better to ask publicly,
so more people can profit the clues.  Oh, you know, he loves books, uses
cute emoticons and makes oink oink.  He's a good reference for me,
hahaha!!  ;)
Tender kisses for all of you!  <3

Hi Cari!  Hi Bastiani!  :D
Thank you very much for the kind suggestions!  <3
I was writing an answer to Juan, talking about 'sexism' and feminism, but
decided to search about the relations about anarchism, feminism and also
sexism.  I've found several references and different concepts, some of them
a bit confuse and contraditory.
So, it would be unfair to say Juan was wrong.  Some writers think he's
right, but some anarcha-feminists say the 'sexism' really exists and use
this exact word in their texts.  :P
After some reading, I thought it would be more logical to understand the
anarchism decently, before analyzing its relations with feminism and,
maybe, with 'sexism'.  Mental masturbation takes additional time, but is
always fun, hihi!  :)
I've found different definitions of 'sexism' on internet and, being
sincere, I thought some of them are so 'sexist' as the prejudice that they
want to avoid.  There are some good, reasonable definitions, but most of
them were very frustrating.  Meh!  Better to study a bit more and have my
own personal beliefs.  :P
Lots of thankful little kisses, muuaaah!!!  :*

I suggest to watch "Grave of the Fireflies", if someone wish to pay tribute
to Hiroshima in a different way.
It's beautiful and sensible, but also one of the saddest 'anime'  (Japanese
animated movies/series)  that I saw in my whole life.
Not for being Japanese, not for showing the Second World War, but because
it shows the point of view of  children.  Children starving, crying, losing
their parents and dying without ever understanding the war.
In all the wars, what always worries me the most are the children, their
traums.  They don't have any guilt and always suffer all the pain.
Sorry, I didn't find the animated movie with English subtitles on line,
just the trailer.  It's the kind of story so disturbing, so intensely sad
that you can watch only once in your life.  I, probably, was not brave
enough in my searches, pardon.

@_subject: Die Zeit interviews Appelbaum ioerror 
All the times when I read River, I remember it's a pseudonym very used in
sites of sex stories about BDSM or to contact eventual sexual partners.
The same about Rain, Forest and other nicknames like these.  I don't know
if it was just a coincidence, a bad joke or if it is their nature, their
sexual preference.
Well, usually, a vanilla person would not choose this kind of pseudonym,
but I really don't care about their sexual practices.  I just think it's
very fun see chaste, immaculate, innocent vanilla people using hardcore
BDSM nicks.  Really hypocrite, considering that Jake, in some moments, was
judged for his sexuality, not for his character.
I am late with some really important answers, but as I told to a contact
some days later, and repeated to another person today, Jake always
respected me and all my female friends a lot, acting like a real gentleman
and, believe me, some of them are beautiful women and tried to flirt with
him hardly.  :P
He was a very handsome, charismatic, sexy, famous, intelligent man, walking
among lots of all kinds of activists, men and women, in several events
around the whole world.  Very glamorous.  Becoming one of his lovers or
girlfriends was a way of increasing social status, so he really refused a
lot of crazy invasive people to avoid problems and being related to these
people.  He could have sex very easily, in all the places and parties,
without "raping" someone.
I saw it happening in person.  He was very professional and gentle,
refusing more intimate contacts in a polite and discreet way.  He rejected
one of my personal friends in a Brazilian event and she is a young
intelligent woman, much more beautiful and interesting than me.  It is
strange for a 'serial rapist', a crazy psychopath, isn't it?  :-/
Well, let's wait to discover what will happen.  There are lots of things
that simply don't make sense in all this drama.  It would not be rational
or reasonable.
Kisses and hugs for all of you!  :*  <3
PS:  -  Ah, a silly curiosity!  One of "Rivers" liked a lot to write about
incest and bestiality, hardcore taboo themes in general, but I really liked
her writing style, so I tried to contact her to ask about the choice of her
I never received an answer, but it was an interesting experience.  I think
this River in special is a girl, not a guy, and she is very intelligent.
Their stories are very disturbing  -  too 'eeck!!!' for my taste, ugh!  -,
but are intelligent and she got some archetypical desires, with subtle
references to Greek legends.  She is not a stupid girl trying to get
audience.  (Different of the j.a. group members' initial pattern, haha!!)
Well, sex with animals is not vegan, but all the people are animals and I
suppose her "lovers", if really exist, receive a good treatment.  ;)

Being vegan is very fun for lighthearted trolls.  I can use it as excuse
for everything and always will be people thinking I am talking seriously.
Currently, I am saying to some friends that hunting pokémons is not vegan
at all, hahaha!!  ;D
Personally I don't hold much hope for humanity..I figure the solution to
Fermis paradox is self-evident. We are going to fucking destroy ourselves.
Live it up while you can ;)
While the end doesn't arrive, I was reading a bit about Victoria Woodhull
[1] and cute soldering kits.  I really appreciated to learn a bit more
about her.  Great girl, wow!  :D
Yep, thinking about the future can be very depressing, but it's fun to
think about all the possibilities.  I really think technology and goodwill
can make a better world for everybody and  - wow! -  there are lots of
interesting, amazing people in the whole world.
Being alive is still fun, even when everything makes no sense.  Life is
very crazy in some moments.
Now, I was trying to mention a Hardy Har Har quote to make you laugh and
discovered the eternal pessimist hyena is more bitter and depressive in the
Brazilian version, haha!!  ;D
It's funnier, much more dramatic, but was strange to discover how much the
translations can adapt or modify the original talks.  Here the hyena always
complains "I know it won't work...  Oh Heavens!  Oh day!  Oh bad luck!"
instead "Oh me, oh my, oh dear"...   :P
This kind of unexpected fun thing keeps me alive and my mood, more or less,
good.  You know, life is a bitch and sucks, but, in some moments, it is
very expensive, dramatic and doesn't suck well.  ;)
In any case, there are lots of good people and wonderful music in the
world.  And children.  Children always are the hope for a better future!  <3
Tender kisses, warm hugs and lots of hope!  :*

Jake always considered himself a queer, bisexual man.  It was part of his
"problems" when he was publicly judged for his sexuality.  A lot of
moralist, hypocrite people judging his gender, his sexual preferences, not
his character, his real acts.
I've "lost" a "friend", because she said "Jake certainly raped these
people, once he was promiscuous enough to have sexual intercourses with
both genders".
So much prejudice, aff...  Very disgusting.  Judge a person for their
gender and for their sexuality is very stupid.

gender and for their sexuality is very stupid.
that the community has a double standard. That people like Jake who act
male (even if they're gay or bisexual) get lynched. But people who are just
as promiscuous, but act female or androgynous, get a pass. They get to be
I got your point, my love, but I do try to refuse this kind of social
condescension, all these labels.  I am not weaker for being a woman.  I am
not a victim.  And yes, I think it's very disgusting when a person uses
their gender to get benefits.  And yes again, it was very depressing,
really unfair and nocive to see how some people managed their labels
against a "white North American man", being he really guilty or not.  :((
This kind of fake situation creates more prejudice, and more stupid labels,
and more and more social judgements.  The real victims of rape, of all
kinds of brutality and harassment, will lose their credibility, because of
stupid fucking liars and it's sad, unfair, wrong and very, very hurtful for
real victims!  :((
In the other side, I already told you I have transgender friends and make
volunteer work in LGBTQ groups, my love.  There are much hate and
intolerance against them.  It's really hard.
There is so much prejudice against them that it's really hard to discover
the limits between true prejudice or not.  Even working with them, in some
moments, involuntarily, I make horrible gaffes.  :(
Once, I was explaining that a female trans friend was born a man and was
waiting for her hormonal treatment and another trans friend said it was
very offensive for everybody, because my friend always was a woman, since
her birth.  She was not born a man.  I was talking about chromosomes,
genetics only, but I hurt a friend involuntarily.  :(((
Do you understand how hard is having sensibility enough to avoid hurting
fragile people, my love?  So, be careful, please.  Love you!  :*

I really love Ed Sheeran's cover of Bob Dylan's protest song "Masters of

"Masters Of War"  (Bob Dylan)
Come you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks.
You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly.
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain.
You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion'
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud.
You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins.
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do.
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul.
And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand over your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead.

Uff...  Some months ago, I would be happy.  Now, it means nothing...  :((
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Hi all,
We are pleased to accounce that Tor Browser 6.0.4 is ready for testing.
Bundles can be found on:
This release finally brings Tor Browser users the latest Tor stable,
0.2.8.6, and avoids pinging Mozilla servers for system extensions.
The latter was responsible for users getting an extension into their Tor
Browser that resulted in annoying and confusing "Your Firefox is out of
date" notifications on start-up (bug 19890). Thanks to Mozilla engineers
who fixed that issue as fast as possible on their side: the extension is
not shipped to Tor Browser users anymore if they ping Mozilla's server.
Users that are on the alpha channel or are using the hardened Tor
Browser were not affected. The same goes for Tails users as far as we know.
The full changelog since Tor Browser 6.0.3 is:
Tor Browser 6.0.4 -- August 16
 * All Platforms
   * Update Tor to 0.2.8.6
   * Update NoScript to 2.9.0.14
   * Bug 19890: Disable installation of system addons

​It's a list about tecnology and security, but also about people, my dear.
There are lots of places where people disappear when offending the wrong

That's the reason why this list is important.  Here, you will learn more
resources to become anonymous and survive in a world where privacy is
dying.​  There are lots of political discussions, jokes, discussions, but
there is space to teach and to learn too.  You just need to ask for help or

Give this list a chance and help it to be better.  If you want more
technical content, you can post it and it certainly will be good for a lot
of people.  Lots of different points of view can make a more accurate
analisys of qualities and/or deffects in programs, ideas, whatever.  :)

In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK

Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all

Where is the love, the love, the love
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace are so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone
So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know)

As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under

I Can't Breathe.  Black Lives Matter.  All Lives Matter.

justice then we'll all see peace.
"Peace is the accumulation of millions of people, in millions of places,
doing millions of small good things.  Right now more than ever we need to
reach out to each other and find ways to do better than the way we are.  I
know there are more caring people in the world than there are hateful ones,

all cultures and colors.  We are all  and we are all in this
together.  --- When pain or inequality is brought onto one of us, it is
brought onto us all.  Now is a time to put the brakes on the divisiveness
and move toward one another, to grieve, to  and raise our voices as
 for peace, justice and a new way of being.  We need to hit the button hard and fast.  Stop killing.  Seriously.  Stop killing.  We can and

The birthday of my ex-boyfriend was few days ago and I am missing him a

is blue.  In special moments, when I feel inspired or want to celebrate, I
like to create some artesanal make up and nails polishes just for my
personal use.
Tonight, I made a bright blue lipstick and a very sparkling and beautiful
blue nail polish, really joyful like the sky in a perfect Spring day,
because he was the most beautiful music of my life.  I was trying to make
my own colours to give them his name and feel him a little more next to

I made my manicure and I am waiting the nail polishes be completely dry.
While it, I am reading about Amateur Space projects.  My left hand is using
the Sun Days blue colour and the right hand nails is using the Rainy Days
blue colour, my second experiment with nail polishes having my loved maker

green than blue.  Beautiful and bright, but I prefered the happy blue.
This colour is more serious and doesn't seem like him.  :(

Sorry, Shawn, but I agree with Mirimir.  No formal moderation, please.
People should be able to use good sense and self-moderation.  In last case,
we always can use lots and lots of filters.
I only accept moderation in extreme cases, like frequent spam attacks.
Usually, I have to manage this kind of thing in an old list where I am one
of moderators.  Apparently, the words "hackers", "transparency" and
"government" always attract creepy spammers and bots, brrr...  :(
Mirimir, my love, sorry for answering to the retard troll instead just
ignore him, but that message hurt me a lot.  I filter Zzz's messages and
they are sent directly to the trash, but I have another filter only for

not a dirty piece of bone for being in a mangy dog's mouth like Zzz.
I know some of dearest Aaron's friends will probably read or listen about
that stupid message, that ridiculous conspiracy theory, and I could not
permiss this violation of his memory, of his friends and family feelings.
I could not be silent knowing they would feel more pain than me, knowing
how much it would hurt them...  :'(

walking around with my friends.  Silence is comfortable among real friends

crazy people and stories.

believe in God sincerely.  Please, pray for Jake, for his life, his

Agreed.  I love the absence of moderation, even being a moderator in other
discussion and mailing lists.
We are a pretty heterogeneous group, with all kind of persons here.  So,
the best option, more coherent with a cypherpunk list and its anarchist
ideals, would be to permiss that the own members regulate the list, with no
centralized moderation, using -- or not! -- their good sense,
self-moderation and filters.
This list will auto-regulate itself in an organic and natural way, with the
members' answers and comments, actions and reactions.
It would be pretty hard, almost impossible to be completely impartial
here...  An example:  - I would deny this kind of responsability here
because I would feel a 'censor' in this list, not a moderator.  I certainly
would kick-ban Zzz and eat a burrito to celebrate!  :P
"Burro" in Portuguese is "donkey" and, even being a substantive, it can be
used as adjective to say that 'someone is stupid, limited'.  Example:  "Zz
is very 'burro'.  The diminutive would be "burrinho", but "burrito" would
also be accepted as "little donkey" here and celebrate Zzz's expulsion
eating burritos with much salsita, guacamole, lemon and lots of chiles
('peppers', not the 'meat chilli', please)  would be great and pretty
funny, yay!!!  :D
Or pizza, because Italian food is always perfect, one of the possible
proofs of God's existence!    (*-*)  <3

Patti Smith - People Have The Power
I was dreaming in my dreaming
Of an aspect bright and fair
And my sleeping it was broken
But my dream it lingered near
In the form of shining valleys
Where the pure air recognized
And my senses newly opened
I awakened to the cry
That the people / have the power
To redeem / the work of fools
Upon the meek / the graces shower
It's decreed / the people rule
The people have the power
The people have the power
The people have the power
The people have the power
Vengeful aspects became suspect
And bending low as if to hear
And the armies ceased advancing
Because the people had their ear
And the shepherds and the soldiers
Lay beneath the stars
Exchanging visions
And laying arms
To waste / in the dust
In the form of / shining valleys
Where the pure air / recognized
And my senses / newly opened
I awakened / to the cry
Where there were deserts
I saw fountains
Like cream the waters rise
And we strolled there together
With none to laugh or criticize
And the leopard
And the lamb
Lay together truly bound
I was hoping in my hoping
To recall what I had found
I was dreaming in my dreaming
God knows / a purer view
As I surrender to my sleeping
I commit my dream to you
The power to dream / to rule
To wrestle the world from fools
It's decreed the people rule
It's decreed the people rule
I believe everything we dream
Can come to pass through our union
We can turn the world around
We can turn the earth's revolution
We have the power
People have the power ...

Sorry, dear, you are very correct and I can explain my strange mistake.  :P
Here, in my country, we use the adjective 'racist' only when happens
discrimination against a race.  When we talk about discrimination against
creeds or origins, we use the adjective 'prejudiced'.
In the last months, because of all the Trump news, I was finding a lot of
texts in English using 'racist' to make reference to any kind of
discrimination, against Muslims, Jews, Mexicans, LGBT, etc.
It doesn't make much sense in Latin languages, but when I asked about it to
a North American friend whether this use was correct, he said it was pretty
usual to call 'racist' an anti-semitic person, for example.
Until I know, prejudice against Jews is terribly stupid, but it is not
racism.  The same about prejudice against Muslims.  It is not racism, but a
horrible prejudice against a creed.  Prejudice against someone's origins
(Mexicans, for example)  is not racism too.  :P
Sorry for the confusion and thanks for the lesson, my dear!  Now I learned
how to express correctly my revolt against prejudiced people, aww...
Pretty sweet of you!  <3

Grandma got run over by a reindeer.
Walking home from our house Christmas eve.
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and grandpa we believe.
She'd been drinking too much eggnog,
And we begged her not to go.
But she forgot her medication, and she
Staggered out the door into the snow.
When we found her Christmas morning,
At the scene of the attack,
She had hoof-prints on her forehead,
And incriminating Claus marks on her back.
Now we're all so proud of grandpa,
He's been taking this so well.
See him in there watching football,
Drinking root beer and
Playing cards with Cousin Mel.
It's not Christmas without Grandma,
All the family's dressed in black
And we just can't help but wonder:
Should we open up her gifts,
Or send them back?
Send them back!!
Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig
And the blue and silver candles
That would just have matched
The hair on grandma's wig.
I've warned all my
Friends and neighbors
Better watch out for yourselves,
They should never give a license
To a man who drives a sleigh
And plays with elves

Please, in this Christmas day, I sincerely ask you to stop disturbing this
You made references to God and the Bible in past messages, so I think you
believe in Jesus existence and sacrifice.  Today is his birthday and you
are doing evil and cruel things.  Do you think it is the correct way of
acting to honor the life and death of your saviour?  :((
If you want to annoy and to attack me, simply do what you always do:  send
me lots of stupid garbage and spam *in private*.  Please, let the
cypherpunks list in peace.  You hate me, so attack only me and don't
disturb the whole list with junk and prejudiced messages, please.
Do something good for this world, creature.  Spread good feelings, not
hate, racism and prejudices.
I am not using nail polish today because I am too exhausted to make my own
manicure after spending the last weeks fixing and cleaning old toys to
donate to poor and refugee children.  My private messages are pretty late
because I was busy painting hundreds and hundreds of little colourful nails
in old dolls to make them more beautiful to the children.  I am naked,
using no make up today, but in the last days I made little clothes,
hundreds of ribbons and beautiful make up in several old dolls to make them
look beautiful like new toys.  Glitter becomes bright fairy dust when you
want to believe in the magic...  <3
Please, try to spread a bit of love instead hate and intolerance, Zenaan.
Think of the children.  They will be the future.
What is the problem about being gay, uh?  I am not gay, but if I was, I
would tell to everybody about my sexual preferences with sincere proud.
It's wonderful when someone accepts their own sexuality and respect the
sexual choices of other people.  It's about love, about respecting people,
about honouring the freedom of letting they live their own lives in the way
they want.
I had threesome sexual relations with my boyfriend and another girl.  It
was wonderful, a really gorgeous meeting.  I don't discard to fall in love
or having sex with a girl again, but I simply don't feel lesbian or
bissexual because my passion is being penetrated and I love real penises,
not the artificial ones.  Just it.  No problems about accepting my own
sexuality, but I think it would be healthy for you to leave the closet and
try to be happy.  So much hate is pure envy, my dear!  ;)
No, I am not.  Ask "Julian".  I never called him in a so intimate way like
you, Zenaan, but I think Assange won't care about it.  Everybody knows I am
more intelligent, charming and interesting than you and if someone like you
can call him "Julian", I probably can too.  ;)
Yep, my ego can be so big as yours!  It's pretty annoying, isn't it?
Hahaha!!   ;D
Nah, my ego trips ignore your existence.  I use better references in my
comparations or it would be too much cowardy with you, little poor devil.
No, not my style.  You offended the Japanese people some times and yes, we
are "rice eaters", but we are proud and believe in honour, loyalty and
respect, concepts that you probably never will understand.
I am a proud rice eater.  My favorite comfort food is "Kare Raisu" in a
spicy veggie version, with no meat and more vegetables than the traditional
Japanese recipe.
Remember in the future that Brazilians love rice too.  With beans, please.
My blood is Japanese, but I am and I always will be Brazilian.  Not because
of my documents, but because it was my heart's choice and I always follow
my heart.
Merry Christmas, Zenaan.  Remember Jesus rejected the hypocrites and,
please, think seriously about being a better person.  I will do the same.
I always make this kind of reflection in the end of all the years.

An interesting talk today at 33c3 by Charleyne Biondi- parallels between
the modern day surveillance and 18th century crusades against masturbation:
The High Priests of the Digital Age
The High Priests of the Digital Age Are Working Behind Your Back to Make
You Confess, and Repent.
Just as 18th century priests enforced total surveillance measures on
masturbators, the new priests of the digital age are listening to your
confessions and forcing you into puritanical repentance.
Who doesn’t have a relative, a friend, a colleague, who broke up because of
an iMessage showing up on the wrong device, fooled by the iCloud, by a
suspicious Facebook like, or a Pokemon caught in the wrong neighborhood?
I want to make the claim that a new system of surveillance, organized by
the new priests of our digital age, are slyly acting behind our back to
make us conform to a new form of puritan morality.
At the beginning of the 18th century, masturbation suddenly became a topic
of intense reflection. In the Enlightenment Encyclopedia it is described as
the new disease of a wounded conscience and a heinous sin. Surprisingly,
the Christian Church was not responsible. It had, until then, never
regarded masturbation as anything other than a marginal problem for adult
men (and especially monks).
The people responsible for making masturbation a sin were economists, who
worried about the consequences of masturbation for productivity in an
economy that depended on the endless desire for more. The condemnation of
masturbation spread, and in no time, doctors were making scientific claims
to prove the dangers of masturbation, while priests made it their new
In the confessional, the sinners had to avow everything, not only their
reprehensible actions, but their reprehensible dreams, the languorous
images that crossed their consciousness, the birth of desire in their
troubled mind. The priests demanded to know it all, the most inner thoughts
of the masturbators. The sinner was meant to keep his own mind under
Today, we believe that we have overcome this obscure period. Masturbation
is widely accepted as a healthy sexual practice. But most importantly, our
liberal democracies strongly posit that public ethics should remain neutral
regarding sexuality, and that each one of us is free to have the sexuality
that we prefer, enjoy, and that no institution is authorized to morally
judge us for our sexual activities.
Yet, I want to make the claim that a new system of surveillance, organized
by the new priests of our digital age, are slyly acting behind our back to
make us conform to a new form of puritan morality. Just as the 18th century
priests did in their Churches, the high priests of the digital age listen
to our confessions, record them, and eventually make us repent.
The economic interests of having us behave morally are numerous: the best
customer is predictable, and who is more predictable than an obedient
child, or a pious wife or husband? From the pithy history of masturbation
to real life break-ups, I will demonstrate the dark connections between
digital surveillance, neoliberal economics and morality.
I am a researcher at Columbia University and Sciences Po Paris in political
philosophy. I am an expert of the Snowden case and digital surveillance.
This will be my first talk on masturbation.

important to avoid downloading unwanted messages. Now that's not an issue.
So each of us can filter out whatever we don't want to see.
I strongly hate moderation, my dear, but I recognize its importance in very

What's wrong with the world, mama
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas
I think the whole world addicted to the drama
Only attracted to things that'll bring you trauma
Overseas, yeah, we try to stop terrorism
But we still got terrorists here livin'
In the USA, the big CIA
The Bloods and The Crips and the KKK
But if you only have love for your own race
Then you only leave space to discriminate
And to discriminate only generates hate
And when you hate then you're bound to get irate, yeah
Madness is what you demonstrate
And that's exactly how anger works and operates
Man, you gotta have love just to set it straight
Take control of your mind and meditate
Let your soul gravitate to the love, y'all, y'all
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'
Can you practice what you preach?
Or would you turn the other cheek?
Father, Father, Father help us
Send some guidance from above
'Cause people got me, got me questionin'
Where is the love (Love)
Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love (The love)
Where is the love, the love, the love
It just ain't the same, old ways have changed
New days are strange, is the world insane?
If love and peace are so strong
Why are there pieces of love that don't belong?
Nations droppin' bombs
Chemical gasses fillin' lungs of little ones
With ongoin' sufferin' as the youth die young
So ask yourself is the lovin' really gone
So I could ask myself really what is goin' wrong
In this world that we livin' in people keep on givin' in
Makin' wrong decisions, only visions of them dividends
Not respectin' each other, deny thy brother
A war is goin' on but the reason's undercover
The truth is kept secret, it's swept under the rug
If you never know truth then you never know love
Where's the love, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the truth, y'all, come on (I don't know)
Where's the love, y'all
People killin', people dyin'
Children hurt and you hear them cryin'

I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder
As I'm gettin' older, y'all, people gets colder
Most of us only care about money makin'
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction
Wrong information always shown by the media
Negative images is the main criteria
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinema
Yo', whatever happened to the values of humanity
Whatever happened to the fairness and equality
Instead of spreading love we're spreading animosity
Lack of understanding, leading us away from unity
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' under
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feelin' down
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feelin' under
Gotta keep my faith alive 'til love is found
Now ask yourself
Where is the love?

Something's wrong with it (Yeah)

More music, more stories.  I love Michael Franti' sweet voice and this song
always makes me cry because remembers me very sad facts.
I Can't Breathe.  Black Lives Matter.  All Lives Matter.
"When we used to have a problem, we used to call the police / But who we
gonna call when the police make a problem?"
"If the world’s full of anger, and everybody’s gotta gun / Then what should
I say, y’all, to my teenage son?"
There is just one love y'all and there is just one beat and when we all see
justice then we'll all see peace.
"Peace is the accumulation of millions of people, in millions of places,
doing millions of small good things.  Right now more than ever we need to
reach out to each other and find ways to do better than the way we are.  I
know there are more caring people in the world than there are hateful ones,
be they civilians, police, soldiers, Democrat, Republican, Christian,
Jewish, Moslem, Hindu, Atheist, Gay, Straight, Transgender, woman and man,
all cultures and colors.  We are all  and we are all in this
together.  --- When pain or inequality is brought onto one of us, it is
brought onto us all.  Now is a time to put the brakes on the divisiveness
and move toward one another, to grieve, to  and raise our voices as
 for peace, justice and a new way of being.  We need to hit the button hard and fast.  Stop killing.  Seriously.  Stop killing.  We can and
will do better than this!!!  We will find a better way!!!  --- Power to the
Peaceful."  -  Michael Franti

America’s a better place than it was fifty years ago
There’s been a whole lotta change, but we gotta long way to go
When we used to have a problem, we used to call the police
But who we gonna call when the police make a problem?
I’m not sayin’ that they’re all bad, I’m not sayin’ that I’m any better
All I’m just tryin’ to say is we could all do a lot better
I say it in my own house, and I say it on the street

A revolution is a battle between the future and the past
The battle’s never over, but the future’s gonna last
Malcolm had an X, y’all, and The King had a dream
And like Spike Lee said, y’all, you should always do the right thing
If the world’s full of anger, and everybody’s gotta gun

Mandela did lock down for twenty-eight years
But there’s billions more, y’all, it’s still rainin’ down tears

But it’s the same as it ever was, we better start today
They can try to divide us, they can try to increase
All the pain and suffering, but this is everybody’s street
There is just ONE LOVE, y’all, there is just ONE BEAT
And when we all see justice, then we’ll all see peace
Same as it ever was, but there’s gotta be a better way

The birthday of my ex-boyfriend was few days ago and I am missing him a

is blue.  In special moments, when I feel inspired or want to celebrate, I
like to create some artesanal make up and nails polishes just for my
personal use.
Tonight, I made a bright blue lipstick and a very sparkling and beautiful
blue nail polish, really joyful like the sky in a perfect Spring day,
because he was the most beautiful music of my life.  I was trying to make
my own colours to give them his name and feel him a little more next to
me.  He always was my best inspiration and loves Astronomy.
I made my manicure and I am waiting the nail polishes be completely dry.
While it, I am reading about Amateur Space projects.  My left hand is using
the Sun Days blue colour and the right hand nails is using the Rainy Days
blue colour, my second experiment with nail polishes having my loved maker

green than blue.  Beautiful and bright, but I prefered the happy blue.
This colour is more serious and doesn't seem like him.  :(
We both love the sea.  I will try a third colour later, using his eyes and

Sorry, Shawn, but I agree with Mirimir.  No formal moderation, please.
People should be able to use good sense and self-moderation.  In last case,
we always can use lots and lots of filters.
I only accept moderation in extreme cases, like frequent spam attacks.
Usually, I have to manage this kind of thing in an old list where I am one
of moderators.  Apparently, the words "hackers", "transparency" and
"government" always attract creepy spammers and bots, brrr...  :(
Mirimir, my love, sorry for answering to the retard troll instead just
ignore him, but that message hurt me a lot.  I filter Zzz's messages and
they are sent directly to the trash, but I have another filter only for
Aaron and his name was mentioned in a very disgusting way.  Aaron's name is
not a dirty piece of bone for being in a mangy dog's mouth like Zzz.
I know some of dearest Aaron's friends will probably read or listen about
that stupid message, that ridiculous conspiracy theory, and I could not
permiss this violation of his memory, of his friends and family feelings.
I could not be silent knowing they would feel more pain than me, knowing
how much it would hurt them...  :'(
Tender hugs and kisses, my dear Mirimir.  It's raining here tonight.  I
always love the rain, the wonderful rain' smell, but in sad moments, I
still think God is crying for us exactly like when I was a child...
When possible, just for curiosity, watch a Japanese movie name "Ima, Ai Ni
Yukimasu", my dear.  I have different reasons, but I also love sunflowers

Some of my dearest friends really hate him, but I still love and respect

those things and my personal researches.  Or not.  Maybe just cooking for
him and walking around with him in silence.  He knows I love ice cream and
walking around with my friends.  Silence is comfortable among real friends
and he knows I can't and I won't judge him.  My life always was full of
crazy people and stories.
I also need to cook to other friends in Germany or I will be strongly
kicked in my poor butt.  Carnitas tacos, different kinds of sushi and also
a bit of Brazilian barbecue  (churrasco).  I am vegetarian, but my family
and friends love meat, haha!!  ;)
Anthony, I know you are a good person, with a big kind heart and that you
believe in God sincerely.  Please, pray for Jake, for his life, his
future.  Pray for all of us, for a better world, please.
I always pray for my loved ones, for a better world, but I am always in

love him for it.

Agreed.  I love the absence of moderation, even being a moderator in other
discussion and mailing lists.
We are a pretty heterogeneous group, with all kind of persons here.  So,
the best option, more coherent with a cypherpunk list and its anarchist
ideals, would be to permiss that the own members regulate the list, with no
centralized moderation, using -- or not! -- their good sense,
self-moderation and filters.
This list will auto-regulate itself in an organic and natural way, with the
members' answers and comments, actions and reactions.
It would be pretty hard, almost impossible to be completely impartial
here...  An example:  - I would deny this kind of responsability here
because I would feel a 'censor' in this list, not a moderator.  I certainly
would kick-ban Zzz and eat a burrito to celebrate!  :P
"Burro" in Portuguese is "donkey" and, even being a substantive, it can be
used as adjective to say that 'someone is stupid, limited'.  Example:  "Zz
is very 'burro'.  The diminutive would be "burrinho", but "burrito" would
also be accepted as "little donkey" here and celebrate Zzz's expulsion
eating burritos with much salsita, guacamole, lemon and lots of chiles
('peppers', not the 'meat chilli', please)  would be great and pretty
funny, yay!!!  :D
Or pizza, because Italian food is always perfect, one of the possible
proofs of God's existence!    (*-*)  <3

Upon the meek / the graces shower
It's decreed / the people rule
The people have the power
The people have the power
The people have the power
The people have the power
Vengeful aspects became suspect
And bending low as if to hear
And the armies ceased advancing
Because the people had their ear
And the shepherds and the soldiers
Lay beneath the stars
Exchanging visions
And laying arms
To waste / in the dust
In the form of / shining valleys
Where the pure air / recognized
And my senses / newly opened
I awakened / to the cry
Where there were deserts
I saw fountains
Like cream the waters rise
And we strolled there together
With none to laugh or criticize
And the leopard
And the lamb
Lay together truly bound
I was hoping in my hoping
To recall what I had found
I was dreaming in my dreaming
God knows / a purer view
As I surrender to my sleeping
I commit my dream to you
The power to dream / to rule
To wrestle the world from fools
It's decreed the people rule
It's decreed the people rule
I believe everything we dream
Can come to pass through our union
We can turn the world around
We can turn the earth's revolution
We have the power
People have the power ...

​Sincerely?  An article that mentions "No Muslims, no terrorism"​ in its

completely too far, not just a bit far.
​Correct, we had some terrorist attacks in Japan in the past and some of
them were pretty cruel because they used chemical weapons in closed places
with few chances of escape, like the subway, and tried to attack the
buildings where the Japanese government is located.  Sad...  :((

Sorry, dear, you are very correct and I can explain my strange mistake.  :P
Here, in my country, we use the adjective 'racist' only when happens
discrimination against a race.  When we talk about discrimination against
creeds or origins, we use the adjective 'prejudiced'.
In the last months, because of all the Trump news, I was finding a lot of
texts in English using 'racist' to make reference to any kind of
discrimination, against Muslims, Jews, Mexicans, LGBT, etc.
It doesn't make much sense in Latin languages, but when I asked about it to
a North American friend whether this use was correct, he said it was pretty
usual to call 'racist' an anti-semitic person, for example.
Until I know, prejudice against Jews is terribly stupid, but it is not
racism.  The same about prejudice against Muslims.  It is not racism, but a
horrible prejudice against a creed.  Prejudice against someone's origins
(Mexicans, for example)  is not racism too.  :P
Sorry for the confusion and thanks for the lesson, my dear!  Now I learned
how to express correctly my revolt against prejudiced people, aww...
Pretty sweet of you!  <3

Grandma Got Run Over By A Reindeer - Elmo & Patsy
Grandma got run over by a reindeer.
Walking home from our house Christmas eve.
You can say there's no such thing as Santa,
But as for me and grandpa we believe.
She'd been drinking too much eggnog,
And we begged her not to go.
But she forgot her medication, and she
Staggered out the door into the snow.
When we found her Christmas morning,
At the scene of the attack,
She had hoof-prints on her forehead,
And incriminating Claus marks on her back.
Now we're all so proud of grandpa,
He's been taking this so well.
See him in there watching football,
Drinking root beer and
Playing cards with Cousin Mel.
It's not Christmas without Grandma,
All the family's dressed in black
And we just can't help but wonder:
Should we open up her gifts,
Or send them back?
Send them back!!
Now the goose is on the table
And the pudding made of fig
And the blue and silver candles
That would just have matched
The hair on grandma's wig.
I've warned all my
Friends and neighbors
Better watch out for yourselves,
They should never give a license
To a man who drives a sleigh
And plays with elves

Please, in this Christmas day, I sincerely ask you to stop disturbing this
You made references to God and the Bible in past messages, so I think you
believe in Jesus existence and sacrifice.  Today is his birthday and you
are doing evil and cruel things.  Do you think it is the correct way of
acting to honor the life and death of your saviour?  :((
If you want to annoy and to attack me, simply do what you always do:  send
me lots of stupid garbage and spam *in private*.  Please, let the
cypherpunks list in peace.  You hate me, so attack only me and don't
disturb the whole list with junk and prejudiced messages, please.
Do something good for this world, creature.  Spread good feelings, not
hate, racism and prejudices.
I am not using nail polish today because I am too exhausted to make my own
manicure after spending the last weeks fixing and cleaning old toys to
donate to poor and refugee children.  My private messages are pretty late
because I was busy painting hundreds and hundreds of little colourful nails
in old dolls to make them more beautiful to the children.  I am naked,
using no make up today, but in the last days I made little clothes,
hundreds of ribbons and beautiful make up in several old dolls to make them
look beautiful like new toys.  Glitter becomes bright fairy dust when you
want to believe in the magic...  <3
Please, try to spread a bit of love instead hate and intolerance, Zenaan.
Think of the children.  They will be the future.
What is the problem about being gay, uh?  I am not gay, but if I was, I
would tell to everybody about my sexual preferences with sincere proud.
It's wonderful when someone accepts their own sexuality and respect the
sexual choices of other people.  It's about love, about respecting people,
about honouring the freedom of letting they live their own lives in the way
they want.
I had threesome sexual relations with my boyfriend and another girl.  It
was wonderful, a really gorgeous meeting.  I don't discard to fall in love
or having sex with a girl again, but I simply don't feel lesbian or
bissexual because my passion is being penetrated and I love real penises,
not the artificial ones.  Just it.  No problems about accepting my own
sexuality, but I think it would be healthy for you to leave the closet and
try to be happy.  So much hate is pure envy, my dear!  ;)
No, I am not.  Ask "Julian".  I never called him in a so intimate way like
you, Zenaan, but I think Assange won't care about it.  Everybody knows I am
more intelligent, charming and interesting than you and if someone like you
can call him "Julian", I probably can too.  ;)
Yep, my ego can be so big as yours!  It's pretty annoying, isn't it?
Hahaha!!   ;D
Nah, my ego trips ignore your existence.  I use better references in my
comparations or it would be too much cowardy with you, little poor devil.
No, not my style.  You offended the Japanese people some times and yes, we
are "rice eaters", but we are proud and believe in honour, loyalty and
respect, concepts that you probably never will understand.
I am a proud rice eater.  My favorite comfort food is "Kare Raisu" in a
spicy veggie version, with no meat and more vegetables than the traditional
Japanese recipe.
Remember in the future that Brazilians love rice too.  With beans, please.
My blood is Japanese, but I am and I always will be Brazilian.  Not because
of my documents, but because it was my heart's choice and I always follow
my heart.
Merry Christmas, Zenaan.  Remember Jesus rejected the hypocrites and,
please, think seriously about being a better person.  I will do the same.
I always make this kind of reflection in the end of all the years.

An interesting talk today at 33c3 by Charleyne Biondi- parallels between
the modern day surveillance and 18th century crusades against masturbation:
The High Priests of the Digital Age
The High Priests of the Digital Age Are Working Behind Your Back to Make
You Confess, and Repent.
Just as 18th century priests enforced total surveillance measures on
masturbators, the new priests of the digital age are listening to your
confessions and forcing you into puritanical repentance.
Who doesn’t have a relative, a friend, a colleague, who broke up because of
an iMessage showing up on the wrong device, fooled by the iCloud, by a
suspicious Facebook like, or a Pokemon caught in the wrong neighborhood?
I want to make the claim that a new system of surveillance, organized by
the new priests of our digital age, are slyly acting behind our back to
make us conform to a new form of puritan morality.
At the beginning of the 18th century, masturbation suddenly became a topic
of intense reflection. In the Enlightenment Encyclopedia it is described as
the new disease of a wounded conscience and a heinous sin. Surprisingly,
the Christian Church was not responsible. It had, until then, never
regarded masturbation as anything other than a marginal problem for adult
men (and especially monks).
The people responsible for making masturbation a sin were economists, who
worried about the consequences of masturbation for productivity in an
economy that depended on the endless desire for more. The condemnation of
masturbation spread, and in no time, doctors were making scientific claims
to prove the dangers of masturbation, while priests made it their new
In the confessional, the sinners had to avow everything, not only their
reprehensible actions, but their reprehensible dreams, the languorous
images that crossed their consciousness, the birth of desire in their
troubled mind. The priests demanded to know it all, the most inner thoughts
of the masturbators. The sinner was meant to keep his own mind under
Today, we believe that we have overcome this obscure period. Masturbation
is widely accepted as a healthy sexual practice. But most importantly, our
liberal democracies strongly posit that public ethics should remain neutral
regarding sexuality, and that each one of us is free to have the sexuality
that we prefer, enjoy, and that no institution is authorized to morally
judge us for our sexual activities.
Yet, I want to make the claim that a new system of surveillance, organized
by the new priests of our digital age, are slyly acting behind our back to
make us conform to a new form of puritan morality. Just as the 18th century
priests did in their Churches, the high priests of the digital age listen
to our confessions, record them, and eventually make us repent.
The economic interests of having us behave morally are numerous: the best
customer is predictable, and who is more predictable than an obedient
child, or a pious wife or husband? From the pithy history of masturbation
to real life break-ups, I will demonstrate the dark connections between
digital surveillance, neoliberal economics and morality.
I am a researcher at Columbia University and Sciences Po Paris in political
philosophy. I am an expert of the Snowden case and digital surveillance.
This will be my first talk on masturbation.

[OT]  [Friday silly message]
Definitely, without any doubt, I am the world's worst programmer, but this
kind of thing is pure love, ow!  *-*
I love esoteric programming languages and "hello world" using ArnoldC is
pretty cute!  I didn't know this language!  <3
But this is my favorite language, the only one that makes me feel like a
great ninja programmer, yay!!!  :D
Unnecessary is an esoteric programming language. The language is named
'Unnecessary' because of the method this programming language works: the
source file is unnecessary; in fact the existence of source code file leads
to critical error. In case of critical error the interpreter must stop
immediately and report the error.
Unnecessary has no instructions/commands. You can do nothing with this
language, so using it is unnecessary as well. The whole Unnecessary program
is NOP. Or actually, there should be no Unnecessary programs, since only
valid Unnecessary program is a non-existing source code file.
The goal was to create a programming language that is easy to learn, not
very useful, doesn't require input or do output, has no memory, has no
instructions. Only an interpreter is required. As well, good thing is that
distributing Unnecessary programs is extremely easy, and can be done
without computers. As well, storage is no problem: you can have infinite
amount of Unnecessary programs in a memory bit. Actually, storing them
requires less memory than a bit.
Every valid program, however, is a quine. That's the only possible program,
and the only valid form of program. In Unnecessary creating a null quine
doesn't even require the existence of the empty program file, as in other
languages. Has programming ever been easier?(Not to mention that it isn't
even possible to write anything else than bug-free code!)
Oh, and the valid Unnecessary program file extension is "unn".

Zenaan, my dear, your country serves Vegemite to children.  It's a pretty
serious crime against humanity and it occurs daily, in all Australian
It has lots of sodium, a disgusting flavour and stinks more than my
disastrous homemade Sauerkraut.  Am I saying "Hail Australia", Land of
Vegemite and Home of Crocodilo Dundee?  :-)
This crime was horrible, really shocking and sad, but the point is
recognizing publicly the existence of a repulsive crime and never more
permiss that something similar occurs in the whole world, not just
criticizing a country.  Sorry, it doesn't make sense.
I do love my country, but it never will be a blind stupid love.  There are
lots of disgusting crimes here and also in your country, in the USA, in
Russia, in the whole world.  No exceptions.
The USA are not my favorite country, but it was not a regional problem.
Violent crimes happen in every single country of this world, including
Russia.  Please, remember it.
Ah, for your knowledge, I hate all the governments, including Russian.  No
exceptions here too.  As Mirimir, I love Russian people, but it is too much
innocence believing that Russian government is better than North-American
government.  Both are disgusting.

USA killed great part of my dad's family.  They used nuclear weapons to
destroy lifes and cities.  Japan was already deeply destroied when they
decided to test their nuclear bombs.  My dad's family used to live in
Hiroshima.  You know what happened with them.
My mom always says it was racism, that US probably would use the bombs in
some oriental country or in Africa anyway, because oriental people and
black people are always considered inferior people there.  They are not
Caucasian, they are different physically, they have different ways of
being, beliefs, religions, food, etc.
Well, the problem is not North American prejudice, but all the prejudices.
All the people have difficulties to understand, to accept and to respect
differences, to manage their personal references.
USA and Germany used the war as an excuse to test their new toys playing
with human lifes.  Japan, Italy, England, France, all the other countries
didn't do the same just because they had not 'new toys' or they probably
had played with them in a cruel way too.
The problem was not the country, but all the wars.  There are lots of good
people in all the countries, in all the places.  A country is not a villain
or the good guy, Zenaan.  Russia is not better than USA.  They are
different countries and have different backgrounds.  Both deserves respect.
It would not be rational to hate USA for killing my family.  Lots of people
there also lost their families in that stupid and cruel war.  I need to
hate all the wars,governments, bad people, cruelty and lies, not USA.
(Certainly, mosquitos too.  Maybe also Vegemite.)
Take care, everybody!  Have a lovely weekend and lots of love and fun!  <3

And you are still making excuses for "the land of the free"?
I admiss I didn't like Boyce, Dani Moth, Quinn and Ted's messages, but I am
not "making excuses" for their country, Juan.
Ted was the most aggressive of all and I think he was talking only about
Zenaan and you, but he seems _a lot_ the kind of guy who shoots in
someone's head saying that some people "deserves" it for being different.
I was really shocked after reading his messages.
Boyce's act of banning was disgusting, but what really upset me was the
"rape apology" stuff.  It was completely unnecessary and pretty sick
knowing my past and details of my present.  But, well, everybody knows his
ego is much bigger than his intelligence.  He is an intelligent guy, but is
very pretentious.  It always was usual inside Tor Project core team.  He
follows their patterns.
In that occasion, I admiss I hoped sincerely that Boyce and Dani Moth were
raped twice each one, because only a person who _really_  was raped can be
completely sure that making "rape apology" always will be impossible for
I love sex.  Rape is not sex, it is violence, fury, torture.  It's dark.
It is to feel a dark and deep fear of death.  Usually, I don't feel fear of
death.  It is the only certainty in this uncertain life.  I swear I felt
the same desperate fear of death when I was raped.
Nobody deserves to feel this kind of despair.  I was angry in that occasion
and I sincerely apologize for wishing something so cruel for Boyce and
Dani.  I regret it a lot and ask pardon for being like them.  It is not
correct at all.
Quinn is intolerant and has narrow patterns of decency, but he is a good
person and I like him, Juan.  You are not exactly tolerant and open-minded
too, haha!!  ;D
Americans who believe the use of nuclear weapons was justified is now 56%,
with 34% saying it was not. "
Sorry, I don't believe in all researches because I have lots of researchers
as friends and colleagues and I was a researcher in several moments of my
life too, my dear Juan.  And you know, I am terribly hard headed like you,
haha!!  ;D
It was a political decision, not military, Juan.  In all the countries, in
all the places, the problem is the government, not the people.
Few stupid and cruel politicians killed my family, not the North American
people.  There are lots of infinitely sad ghosts stories in Hiroshima.
Shadows and eternal crying...  I sincerely hope these sad ghosts haunt all
the cruel politicians who decided to play with human lives.
My migraine is still killing me and my mood is really bad.  I don't like
drugs, but tried a lots of medicines for pain in last days.  My hard head
and I think they didn't work, haha!!  ;D
I bet you will feel envy now, Juan.  Coconut ice cream and sweet corn ice
cream, nom nom...  Trying usual food will be a disaster.  Ice cream is a
good choice when feeling sick.  My mood will be better soon, hihi...  <3
I was thinking about lemon and ginger popsicles, much better for sickness,
but they had only creamy ice creams now.  So, I will make tea.  Hot and
cold together, hihi...  <3
You are a good person, my dear Juan.  I was wrong about Razer and you being

The same way there are lots of awesome persons in all the countries, there

Well, I am sure Quinn thinks exactly the same thing all the times when I

I never said that I am tolerant and open-minded, Juan.  Sorry if you felt
offended with my words.  I don't support any kind of 'nazis'.  Radical
people are extremely boring.

several moments of my life too
Hmm...  Sorry, after talking about deaths, wars and rapes, I confess I was
thinking only in Portuguese.  Always is the most comfortable language for
Pardon, reading now what wrote yesterday, there are more mistakes and I
didn't write some words when talking about the rapes.  Both made me feel
the same way, the same deep panic of death, the same smell of fear.  Sorry
for it.
"Eu não acredito em todas as pesquisas" here doesn't mean necessarily that
I really do _not_ believe in _all_ researches.  If I really wouldn't
believe in all researches, in Portuguese, I would use 'double negative',
what doesn't exist in English, sorry.  I would say "Eu não acredito em
nenhuma pesquisa", Juan.  I simply translated - literally - what I thought
in that moment and doesn't make sense in English, sorry.
I was trying to say that not necessarily I believe in all researches, that
I don't believe in some of them...  Does it sound better now or should I

Juan, you and Quinn are not my friends, but I appreciate both.  Certainly
not enough to invite you to visit my house or to borrow money and books,
but I like you both.  :)
A fool example, I have friends who believe in God in a blind way and also
extremely Atheists friends.  They are good persons and I sincerely respect
all of them.  They have different personal beliefs, but they all have good
character and are intelligent.
of shit like quinn is a good guy. Since you believe that, your moral
judgements are a bad joke...which shows what you really stand for.
He is a good person.  Too moralist and intollerant for being my friend, but
he is a good person.
You are a good person, but very aggressive in some moments and pretty
intollerant too.
Uff...  Juan, you seem to know more about me than myself to judge me so bad
in all the moments.  Please, what do I really stand for?
evil intentions or acts. As to being 'open minded', again, I'm certainly
not open minded to stupidity. Being 'open minded' to stupidity is hardly a

any kind of 'nazis'.  Radical people are extremely boring.
the nazis were not that they were radicals. Or that they were 'boring'...
I was not talking about nazism, only about extremely radical people:
feminazis, vegan nazis, econazis, etc.  Sorry, at least for me, radical
people are always boring and/or annoing.
ignore this particular poll because it doesn't paint the americunts in a
good light. But the poll is completely consistent with americunt 'culture'.
If anything the real numbers are prolly higher.
Juan, it hurts me a lot because it is a pool about my family's death, not
because "doesn't paint the americans in a good light".  It would hurt me
the same if it was a pool about French people opinion, if it was a pool
about Chinese people opinion...  The problem is thinking about people
saying that it was correct to use nuclear weapons to kill people.
And, please, always remember that laws, sausages and researches are not

comments I've made here. Same thing for quinn. All we know about him is
that he's a totalitarian american shitbag. Whatever your personal
connection to him is, (if any) it's irrelevant here.
Why are you so sure about it, my dear Juan?  You never will know exactly
what I know, hihi...  Nobody can know _exactly_ what another person knows.
Never forget it, my dear.  :-)
that quinn is a 'good' person too, since we represent completely opposed
views of what 'good' means.
My dear Juan, I am talking about MY subjetive impressions about persons in
general.  Why can't you accept that I don't think exactly what you want I
think?  :(((
Is it so offensive for you if I have my own opinion and it is different
than yours?  Why are you trying to impose me your opinion like a dictator?
Please, you say to be an 'anarchist', so be coherent.  You say I am a
'retard', but I am an honest retard and you are not being honest, if you
really are an anarchist.
I didn't try to impose you my opinion.  I simply told you what I think
about you, and people, and about countries, wars, whatever...  I never said
my words are an 'absolute truth' or that I never will be wrong...
Hey!  Don't you respect a person's beliefs?  Why do you think a religious
person is a liar?  :P
Not necessarily.  Even using Math or Physics, nobody can prove the
existence or not of a God (or Gods, or Godess, or Godesses, whatever).  If
God exists, it is not a lie.
There are several religions and holy books, but there is not an
unambiguous, definitive interpretation of God, Juan.  Sincerely?  I don't
trust religions and holy books, but I tried to study lots and lots of
possibilities when younger.  Reviews?  Always is about love.  Trying to be
a good person and avoiding to be a bad person is enough.
(I am not talking about being a 'saint' or something similar.  Just
avoiding to be a son of a b¡tch is enough and God and/or the people will
sincerely appreciate your efforts!  :-)
I know, infinitely subjetive points of view, different backgrounds and ways
of being, etc, etc...  Part of world's beauty is how different can be the
persons.  Some people explode cities using nuclear weapons, some people try
to build a whole new world...  :-)
Oh, good!  hihi...  :-)
'good' utopian governments that do stuff that you think is 'good', like, I
don't know 'free' schooling for poor children.
You already know what I think about governments.  I don't support them.

'aggressive' or 'intolerant'.
Only limited and/or stupid people respect labels.  A person is much more
than empty labels.  Persons are their acts, their thoughts, their words,
not the labels they like to use in society.
If you want to use the "anarchist" label, the problem is yours, not mine.
I hate governments, but I really think it is very limited to say "Oh, I am
Instead just talking about being a proud anarchist in lists, mimimi
mimimi, do something real to destroy governments.  "Talking is cheap, show
me the code", do you remember?  I am doing my part instead consider myself
an anarchist.
I only make jokes using 'vegan' and 'veggie' labels to explain that I don't
eat meat and I don't like to kill animals, because the people really have
serious problems to understand my reasons and it is easier to use a stupid
already knowed label than spending time explaining all my actions.  Nobody
seems to care enough to see my acts, they just want to know my labels and
judge them.
Sorry, if I need to say "Oh, Juan, I am anarchist" to be accepted for you,
we never will be friends.  See my actions and who I am instead trying to
impose your opinion with offenses.  :P
Uff...  God, I didn't say you are wrong.  It was an hypothesis.  Please,
think instead being so defensive.
and irrelevant thought?
I was answering to your comment, Juan.  Please, read again what you wrote
before.  My thoughts are so 'irrelevant' as yours.  Or do you *really*
think that everything you wrote is relevant for someone?  Sorry, the world
doesn't work this way!  :-)
Believe me, nobody says only 'relevant' things.  First of all, because
'relevance' is pretty subjective.  An important thing for me not
necessarily will be relevant for me, and vice versa.

Uff...  Juan, did you really read what I wrote before?  I am too lazy to
repeat everything again!  :(((
Sorry, I will stop to spend your time and also mine, Juan.  Believe me, we
both will be banned again if we make an infinite discussion here and I
certainly will win in the end.
I am not saying that I am right.  I am just saying I will win at the end.
Remember:  I can do the same things that you, and wearing high heels, make
up and dress.  And I am much more 'troll' and 'hard headed' than you can be

Justin Bieber lyrics until you stop being an anarchist disgrace!  ;)
Zen, I didn't know Master Y-Oda was here, but it was an unexpected joy.  I
call him 'FOdastico Mestre YOda'  (something like "F*cking Fantastic Master
YOda")  and several other strange names, because he is almost a "ninja
master" in several subjects, is a very practical person and has an awesome
sense of humor.
Yesterday, I wrote a long letter to a hackerspace and mentioned Master
Y-Oda as reference.  Believe me, you can not agree with his opinions and
suggestions, as I also do in some moments, but this guy does deserve our
respect, Zen.
Oda is able of discreetely trolling governments, always smiling and
listening to music.  Not necessarily good music, because we have pretty
different musical tastes in some moments, haha!!  ;D
He not only thinks out the box, he kicks the box, my dear.  Oda has an
amazing sense of humor, a fantastic intelligence, a strong personality and
a lovely hair.  Not so gorgeous as ryziek's hair, of course, but I love Oda
and all the things that make him so special.  Kind soul, practical actions,
unexpected ideas, creative hackings, dark sense of humor and beautiful hair
included, haha!!  ;D
Governments, police, teachers and my own parents can't make me stop an
argument.  Oda can do it just saying "Stop, Ceci".  I think it shows you
how much I respect him.  I have good reasons for it, Zen.
He was trying to help.  If you didn't appreciate his suggestions, believe
me, he absolutely doesn't care.  The same about being an anarchist
disgrace, hihi!  ;)
Warm hugs!

that he'll bring you back to the tor list for your ""service"" (and don't
tell me you didn't think about that opening this thread.Oh no. You just
wanted to "open" our eyes to the goodness in boyce. oops).
No, I was just thinking about hardcore wild and hot sex with a guy who
hates me.  All that I want in my life is flirting with Boyce in public,
using the cpunks list.  Oh, the way he banned me was so sexy, Alex...  How
about telling everybody I was doing "ludicrous rape apologetics" in his
inbox?  Wow, it was really exciting!  Learn with him how to seduce a woman,
my dear!  :-)
Hahaha, talking seriously now...  Alex, my dear, what is the problem with
you in the last weeks?  Your last messages had more "f*ck this, f*ck that"
than my whole sexual life, you are much more aggressive than usual and you
simply didn't read the message content, silly boy!  :-/
When I forwarded the message, I was trying:
1)  to annoy Juan a bit.  I like him a lot and he knows it.
2)  to ask for some help for Lina, showing her thread in another list
(Liberation Tech).  Both, list and thread,can be interesting for some
people here, I suppose.
3)  to prove that even Boyce is able of good things, like _everybody_ in
this world.
I have a lot of things in common with Hitler, Alex.  I am a vegetarian who
loves children, animals, books, painting and German people too.  Am I a bad
person because of my preferences?  :-)
Boyce wrote to Lina in private, not in public, giving her a suggestion.  I
really appreciate kind and spontaneous support acts.  The fact he used
three sentences doesn't care.  In some moments, three simple words are
enough.  Some people can write books without saying something really
relevant.  Writing a lot doesn't mean anything, Alex.
I don't know if Boyce is a member of cpunks list or not, but it doesn't
care.  I don't want to be part of tor-talk list again and I know he is too
proud to apologize for being injust with his stupid allegations of rape
You don't know me enough, Alex.  Don't try to judge my acts using your way
of thinking as measure, please.  We are very different.
I don't know what "PR" means, but I probably will be annoied with you if I
search for its meaning.  I really did not understand the "service" part,
but I am sure you were so injust as Boyce.  Congratulations, Alexander.
You did it like a boss...  whoops, a Boyce!  ;)
Hihi...  Take care, silly boy.  :-)

can - they're just doing their jobs you see.
The Latin word "mal"  (or "malus"),  used as root in several Latin
languages, means “bad” or “evil".  It was used in the origins of the words
"malice" and "malicious".
The etymology of this word makes explicit its meaning.  It is a "malicious
software".  An intentionally harmful software.
If you want to believe a "malware" can be a "goodware"  - or something
similar -  because people are good, is your option, but it definitely is
*not* a wise choice, in my humble opinion.

act according to their schooling and training and upbringing, as best they

the FBI are actually volunteers (friends of employees just helping out), so
they're really good guys. We cannot deny the FBI employees gainful
employment which provides them opportunities for honourable actions. At
least some of the time. At least, I assume so.
The people are good, but we have trolls and stupid persons in all places.
A good person can be really stupid, did you know it?  We can have stupid
people even in respected lists of discussion.  :-)
Recent examples in this list:  -  People saying I am making "rape apology"
when I am trying to stop a stupid lynch mob and severe human rights
violation.  People saying how "beautiful and artistic" was using a nuclear
bomb to explode the city where my family used living before being killed.
People saying I was flattering a guy just because of a stupid mailing list.
You know, we have disgusting people telling lies and writing stupid things,
making propaganda for corrupt politicians and institutions in every place
of this world, all minutes.  Even on the best mailing and discussion
lists.  And they never apologize when are injust.

supporting other psychopaths, like Donald Trump, for example -  just for

Exactly what Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un did few months ago, do you

You should search about KGB methods of torture and about Russian LGBTQ
rights too, please.  Putin has much more in common with Trump and CIA than
you would like to know.

Psychopaths never are very coherent, because they care only about their own
interests, not about real values and honor.
Please, consider using the "Put In panties" all the times when making PR

The removal of content is happening since last month, my dear Lots of strange things are happening and there is evident censorship in
some places when you mention Jake's name.
This kind of thing makes me feel really upset and I am considering if was
correct to avoid cruel gossip, because it is disgusting, vile.  "JA group"
used this kind of despicable resource, but they are not a good and healthy
reference for normal people, with a little bit of ethics.  "Decent people",
using Quinn's favorite expression.  "Sane people", in my own code of ethics.
I never asked Jake about this fact, because it would sound disgusting and
non sense for him and he already has lots of more relevant worries.  I used
this embarrassing information for my personal conviction only.
We can't use this information in a trial, but I am sure he had no sexual
contact or approach with one of the alleged victims because he has a very
sensitive nose.
Jake is very clean and really cares a lot about personal hygiene.
Everybody knows how much he cares about his apparence and his smell always
is good, even after a longer talk.  A comfortable smell that remembers me
"cleanliness", daily baths and use of cleaning products, like soap,
shampoo, etc.
It is an important detail for a Brazilian person.  We do love water and
baths.  Brazilians usually are considered "bath addicteds" and "maniacs for
cleanliness, hygiene products and perfums" in whole world.
The girl is knowed in some activist circles for _not_ having an accurate
hygiene and for several disgusting intimate smells.  One of her ex-lovers,
who I've knowed in person, confirmed me it some weeks ago and I really felt
bad for her.
I don't know her in person and I don't know if she has a disease or just
unsanitary, unhygienic habits, but being associated with "sour cream",
"rotten cheese" and other bizarre odors is very humilliating.  He never had
courage to lick any part of her body and left her after two disastrous
sexual meetings.
Jake never would touch a stinky person in an intimate way.  He is too clean
for it and he could have sex with a better person very, very easily.
Sorry, I can't believe it.  He probably would reject her sexual advances,
exactly like her ex-lover did.
She is a revengeful person and, well, a rejected woman is the Hell in a
human form.  She said his ex-lover is gay and he doesn't like sex to some
people.  He is not gay and likes sex a lot, but only with clean women.  Not
her case!  :P
It was childish and cruel, but I confess when I was angry, I tried to play
with two horrible versions of "Smelly Cat"  (one of Phoebe' songs, Friends
sitcom),  provisionally called "Smelly Pussy" and "Smelly Little Cat" just
for making Jake laugh a bit.  It was a bad idea and I left it at all.  Jake
deserves good music and I sing like a banshee dying, uh!  :((
(I don't know if it is really used, but they teach a pussy is a "little
cat" for foreign people and I just learned it can be a bad word when I
tried to explain how much I love puppies and kittens to my ex-boyfriend.  I
said "I love pussies" and he laughed for a long time before explaining my
mistake...  d'oh!  :P)
Tender kisses.  Wish you all a lovely day!  :*
Cecilia, at hospital, in a horrible mood...  I've spent my whole week
visiting hospitals and strongly wished to die all the times after reading

Zenaan and Alexander,
It's fun in some moments, but I decided to avoid feeding dumb trolls.  Time
and patience are very limited resources, so it probably will be my last
message for you both.  You are really boring, meh!  :(
Sorry, I don't respect dumb, stupid and pretentious people, with a huge
complex of superiority and an ego bigger than Putin's baldness.
But if you both want to complain about who has the biggest ego, please,
always remember:  -  I am fabulous, b¡tches.  You both are donkeys, I am a
colorful unicorn.  You walk, I parade.  You will be dust, I will be
glitter!  <3
Hahaha!!  Just joking for the lulz, but remember I am a professional troll
and you both are begginners and not so smart.  ;)
I am not a pig, but I prefer being juicy, tasty bacon than repulsive
Vegemite.  And I really love pearls.  They look great with dresses and high
heels.  Very classy!  <3
At least, I am really happy, because Zenaan finally stopped writing me in
private and copying me in every stupid message sent to a person of this
group.  It was ridiculous and non sense, but he spent more than a month to
perceive he was being ignored and/or rejected.  Very slow and disgusting
guy, ugh!  :(((
Happy oink, oink for you both!  (ˆ(oo)ˆ)
Cecilia, adopting Zen Chinchilla Philosophy from now on, hihi...  ;)
PS 1:  -  A person who really cares about another person, at least, try to
write correctly their name.  The problem was not misspelling Georgi's name,
but showing you simply don't care about him, even after spending zillions
of words trying to prove you really care about others.  Pure
contradiction.  "D'oh!" again, slow guy.
PS 2:  -  You probably will appreciate the "Zen Chinchilla Philosophy",
Mirimir.  Some years ago, I adapted an idea just to annoy a stupid guy and
used a chinchilla as example.  It worked well, but I should write a "Zen
Chichilla Manifesto" just for fun.  You know, I am so cute as a
chinchilla.  But  - thank God! -  not so furry, haha!!  ;D
Repeating:  -  Please, if I die in the next days, tell everybody that all
these disgusting and repetitive messages licking Putin's b ignoring
all the Russian government's fails, and against "The West", "The Empire",
etc, etc, killed me with infinite and painful boredom, ugh!  It's a cruel
torture, a real crime against the humanity!  :P
But, well, everything in Australia wants to kill you.  Aparently, also
Zenaan, even when pretending to be an eternal misunderstood victim of
society's ignorance.  Oh, poor Zen!  :'(

Off-Topic: Donald Trump's and Vladimir Putin's Shared Agenda Should Alarm
Anyone Concerned About Democracy
        In brief: In his business dealings, He, Trump seems
        increasingly dependent on money from Russia and from the
        former Soviet republics within its increasingly active sphere
        of influence. This is because most of the big banks on this
        side of the pond won't go near him without HazMat suits. (Gee,
        could it be that his sudden emergence as a Warren-esque
        crusader against the "rigged system" of the banksters is less
        of a principled opposition and simply pure animal vengeance?
        Unpossible!) As Marshall points out, this isn't exactly a deep
        corporate secret ... Marshall presents a judicious but
        comprehensive bill of indictment as regards He, Trump's
        relationship with Putin. He doesn't allege direct complicity,
        only a mutuality of interest that should alarm anyone
        concerned about the stability of American democracy. He also
        carefully traces the connections to Russia of several of He,
        Trump's crucial advisors. (I knew about Paul Manafort's
        connection to Putin's Ukrainian marionette, but the
        relationship that Carter Page, one of the campaign's key
        foreign-policy advisers, to Gazprom, the Russian energy
        behemoth that Putin controls, was a new one for me.) He shies
        away from the more baroque conspiracy theories, although I
        don't think the notion that Russian intelligence was behind
        the hack-and-release of 20,000 internal DNC e-mails at exactly
        the right time is that far-fetched.  This should be the only
        story about the Trump campaign until he comes clean.

I am a feminist, not a feminazi, Juan.  Same rights, dear.  It's more fun

than you, but using make-up, dress and high heels.  And lots of pearls,

Do you remember when those "victims" wrote that some women were using their
sexuality to attack other women?  Ah!  When they are supposedly raped, Jake
is guilty.  When I am raped and tell publicly what means being a real
victim, I am using my sexuality against other women.  Do you understand the
difference?  I do not.

sexism in witches hunter without proofs, without due process.

Hi, Digitalfolklore!
Hope you wanted to send this message to cypherpunks lists, not for me in
special.  :)
I don't know exactly what is happening, but received some strange private
messages in different channels about Wikileaks.  Err...  Why me?  Did
someone say something or is just my famous oriental charm?  :-/
Usually, I love Wikileaks, but I do not support some of their last
actions.  Everybody knows about strange leaks to manage USA elections, the
Turkish leaks and deleted bizarre tweets.  These things annoyed me a lot.
I wasn't tweeting in the last times, but, few days ago, I admiss I tweeted
about    and retweeted one of Wikileaks' account
tweets about Jake.  Just it.
Only a cordial relationship between an institucional account and a poor
unknowed follower, who had lost a lot of friends, contacts and followers in
last months.  I am only lurking on twitter, avoiding flaming wars and
boring people.  No much patience for all the drama.
It's my usual behaviour in foreign lists too.  I only broke my typical
pattern because of Jake.  I was already an old reader here and on tor-talk
list, before being kickbanned.  I am very noisy and chaotical, and my
English stinks more than someone's... little cat!  So, silence is always
more comfortable for me, even being a talkative troll.  :)
Am I guilty of some of their bad leaks and was not informed about it yet?
They were noisy and chaotical, but not mine!  :)
Ah, I always make a lot of strange things, but not personalized panties.
If you want Snodew or Assange panties, you can suggest the idea to
Wikileaks.  Certainly they will be very sexy, but not like the charming
"Put in" panties, hihi!  :)
It would be fun to use Tor Project panties.  I still use their stickers in
my notebooks and devices, even after all this mess.  It's a pity that
g-strings have no much area to onions or Schneier facts, hahaha!!!  ;D
There are Schneier Facts T-shirts, but cryptography in panties would be
awesome, wow!!!  Loved the idea!!! Ok, I will consider it just for fun!  <3

[OT]  [Friday silly message]
Definitely, without any doubt, I am the world's worst programmer, but this
kind of thing is pure love, ow!  *-*
I love esoteric programming languages and "hello world" using ArnoldC is
pretty cute!  I didn't know this language!  <3
But this is my favorite language, the only one that makes me feel like a
great ninja programmer, yay!!!  :D
Unnecessary is an esoteric programming language. The language is named
'Unnecessary' because of the method this programming language works: the
source file is unnecessary; in fact the existence of source code file leads
to critical error. In case of critical error the interpreter must stop
immediately and report the error.
Unnecessary has no instructions/commands. You can do nothing with this
language, so using it is unnecessary as well. The whole Unnecessary program
is NOP. Or actually, there should be no Unnecessary programs, since only
valid Unnecessary program is a non-existing source code file.
The goal was to create a programming language that is easy to learn, not
very useful, doesn't require input or do output, has no memory, has no
instructions. Only an interpreter is required. As well, good thing is that
distributing Unnecessary programs is extremely easy, and can be done
without computers. As well, storage is no problem: you can have infinite
amount of Unnecessary programs in a memory bit. Actually, storing them
requires less memory than a bit.
Every valid program, however, is a quine. That's the only possible program,
and the only valid form of program. In Unnecessary creating a null quine
doesn't even require the existence of the empty program file, as in other
languages. Has programming ever been easier?(Not to mention that it isn't
even possible to write anything else than bug-free code!)
Oh, and the valid Unnecessary program file extension is "unn".

It has lots of sodium, a disgusting flavour and stinks more than my

USA killed great part of my dad's family.  They used nuclear weapons to
destroy lifes and cities.  Japan was already deeply destroied when they
decided to test their nuclear bombs.  My dad's family used to live in
Hiroshima.  You know what happened with them.
My mom always says it was racism, that US probably would use the bombs in
some oriental country or in Africa anyway, because oriental people and
black people are always considered inferior people there.  They are not
Caucasian, they are different physically, they have different ways of
being, beliefs, religions, food, etc.
Well, the problem is not North American prejudice, but all the prejudices.
All the people have difficulties to understand, to accept and to respect
differences, to manage their personal references.
USA and Germany used the war as an excuse to test their new toys playing
with human lifes.  Japan, Italy, England, France, all the other countries
didn't do the same just because they had not 'new toys' or they probably
had played with them in a cruel way too.
The problem was not the country, but all the wars.  There are lots of good
people in all the countries, in all the places.  A country is not a villain
or the good guy, Zenaan.  Russia is not better than USA.  They are
different countries and have different backgrounds.  Both deserves respect.
It would not be rational to hate USA for killing my family.  Lots of people
there also lost their families in that stupid and cruel war.  I need to
hate all the wars,governments, bad people, cruelty and lies, not USA.

And you are still making excuses for "the land of the free"?
I admiss I didn't like Boyce, Dani Moth, Quinn and Ted's messages, but I am
not "making excuses" for their country, Juan.
Ted was the most aggressive of all and I think he was talking only about
Zenaan and you, but he seems _a lot_ the kind of guy who shoots in
someone's head saying that some people "deserves" it for being different.
I was really shocked after reading his messages.
Boyce's act of banning was disgusting, but what really upset me was the
"rape apology" stuff.  It was completely unnecessary and pretty sick
knowing my past and details of my present.  But, well, everybody knows his
ego is much bigger than his intelligence.  He is an intelligent guy, but is
very pretentious.  It always was usual inside Tor Project core team.  He
follows their patterns.
In that occasion, I admiss I hoped sincerely that Boyce and Dani Moth were
raped twice each one, because only a person who _really_  was raped can be
completely sure that making "rape apology" always will be impossible for
I love sex.  Rape is not sex, it is violence, fury, torture.  It's dark.
It is to feel a dark and deep fear of death.  Usually, I don't feel fear of
death.  It is the only certainty in this uncertain life.  I swear I felt
the same desperate fear of death when I was raped.
Nobody deserves to feel this kind of despair.  I was angry in that occasion
and I sincerely apologize for wishing something so cruel for Boyce and
Dani.  I regret it a lot and ask pardon for being like them.  It is not
correct at all.
Quinn is intolerant and has narrow patterns of decency, but he is a good
person and I like him, Juan.  You are not exactly tolerant and open-minded
too, haha!!  ;D
Americans who believe the use of nuclear weapons was justified is now 56%,

Sorry, I don't believe in all researches because I have lots of researchers

life too, my dear Juan.  And you know, I am terribly hard headed like you,
haha!!  ;D
It was a political decision, not military, Juan.  In all the countries, in
all the places, the problem is the government, not the people.
Few stupid and cruel politicians killed my family, not the North American
people.  There are lots of infinitely sad ghosts stories in Hiroshima.
Shadows and eternal crying...  I sincerely hope these sad ghosts haunt all
the cruel politicians who decided to play with human lives.
My migraine is still killing me and my mood is really bad.  I don't like

I really do _not_ believe in _all_ researches.  If I really wouldn't
believe in all researches, in Portuguese, I would use 'double negative',
what doesn't exist in English, sorry.  I would say "Eu não acredito em
nenhuma pesquisa", Juan.  I simply translated - literally - what I thought
in that moment and doesn't make sense in English, sorry.

of shit like quinn is a good guy. Since you believe that, your moral
judgements are a bad joke...which shows what you really stand for.
He is a good person.  Too moralist and intollerant for being my friend, but
he is a good person.
You are a good person, but very aggressive in some moments and pretty
intollerant too.
Uff...  Juan, you seem to know more about me than myself to judge me so bad
in all the moments.  Please, what do I really stand for?
evil intentions or acts. As to being 'open minded', again, I'm certainly
not open minded to stupidity. Being 'open minded' to stupidity is hardly a

any kind of 'nazis'.  Radical people are extremely boring.
the nazis were not that they were radicals. Or that they were 'boring'...
I was not talking about nazism, only about extremely radical people:
feminazis, vegan nazis, econazis, etc.  Sorry, at least for me, radical
people are always boring and/or annoing.
ignore this particular poll because it doesn't paint the americunts in a
good light. But the poll is completely consistent with americunt 'culture'.
If anything the real numbers are prolly higher.
Juan, it hurts me a lot because it is a pool about my family's death, not
because "doesn't paint the americans in a good light".  It would hurt me
the same if it was a pool about French people opinion, if it was a pool
about Chinese people opinion...  The problem is thinking about people
saying that it was correct to use nuclear weapons to kill people.
And, please, always remember that laws, sausages and researches are not
made in a beautiful way.  I don't trust in all researchers that I've
knowed.  I already saw some serious frauds in works and books.

Serotonin and endorphins are science.  I told you I like science.  I was
not offending you.  Search about hormones and their effects in the mood.

comments I've made here. Same thing for quinn. All we know about him is
that he's a totalitarian american shitbag. Whatever your personal
connection to him is, (if any) it's irrelevant here.
Why are you so sure about it, my dear Juan?  You never will know exactly
what I know, hihi...  Nobody can know _exactly_ what another person knows.
Never forget it, my dear.  :-)
that quinn is a 'good' person too, since we represent completely opposed
views of what 'good' means.
My dear Juan, I am talking about MY subjetive impressions about persons in
general.  Why can't you accept that I don't think exactly what you want I
think?  :(((
Is it so offensive for you if I have my own opinion and it is different
than yours?  Why are you trying to impose me your opinion like a dictator?
Please, you say to be an 'anarchist', so be coherent.  You say I am a
'retard', but I am an honest retard and you are not being honest, if you
really are an anarchist.
I didn't try to impose you my opinion.  I simply told you what I think
about you, and people, and about countries, wars, whatever...  I never said
my words are an 'absolute truth' or that I never will be wrong...
Hey!  Don't you respect a person's beliefs?  Why do you think a religious
person is a liar?  :P
Not necessarily.  Even using Math or Physics, nobody can prove the
existence or not of a God (or Gods, or Godess, or Godesses, whatever).  If
God exists, it is not a lie.
There are several religions and holy books, but there is not an
unambiguous, definitive interpretation of God, Juan.  Sincerely?  I don't
trust religions and holy books, but I tried to study lots and lots of
possibilities when younger.  Reviews?  Always is about love.  Trying to be
a good person and avoiding to be a bad person is enough.
(I am not talking about being a 'saint' or something similar.  Just
avoiding to be a son of a b¡tch is enough and God and/or the people will
sincerely appreciate your efforts!  :-)
I know, infinitely subjetive points of view, different backgrounds and ways
of being, etc, etc...  Part of world's beauty is how different can be the
persons.  Some people explode cities using nuclear weapons, some people try
to build a whole new world...  :-)
Oh, good!  hihi...  :-)
'good' utopian governments that do stuff that you think is 'good', like, I
don't know 'free' schooling for poor children.
You already know what I think about governments.  I don't support them.
making sure...before pointing out that you are in no position to call me
'aggressive' or 'intolerant'.
Only limited and/or stupid people respect labels.  A person is much more
than empty labels.  Persons are their acts, their thoughts, their words,
not the labels they like to use in society.
If you want to use the "anarchist" label, the problem is yours, not mine.
I hate governments, but I really think it is very limited to say "Oh, I am
Instead just talking about being a proud anarchist in lists, mimimi
mimimi, do something real to destroy governments.  "Talking is cheap, show
me the code", do you remember?  I am doing my part instead consider myself
an anarchist.
I only make jokes using 'vegan' and 'veggie' labels to explain that I don't
eat meat and I don't like to kill animals, because the people really have
serious problems to understand my reasons and it is easier to use a stupid
already knowed label than spending time explaining all my actions.  Nobody
seems to care enough to see my acts, they just want to know my labels and
judge them.
Sorry, if I need to say "Oh, Juan, I am anarchist" to be accepted for you,
we never will be friends.  See my actions and who I am instead trying to
impose your opinion with offenses.  :P
Uff...  God, I didn't say you are wrong.  It was an hypothesis.  Please,
think instead being so defensive.
and irrelevant thought?
I was answering to your comment, Juan.  Please, read again what you wrote
before.  My thoughts are so 'irrelevant' as yours.  Or do you *really*
think that everything you wrote is relevant for someone?  Sorry, the world
doesn't work this way!  :-)
Believe me, nobody says only 'relevant' things.  First of all, because
'relevance' is pretty subjective.  An important thing for me not
necessarily will be relevant for me, and vice versa.
respect they deserve?
Uff...  Juan, did you really read what I wrote before?  I am too lazy to
repeat everything again!  :(((
Sorry, I will stop to spend your time and also mine, Juan.  Believe me, we
both will be banned again if we make an infinite discussion here and I
certainly will win in the end.
I am not saying that I am right.  I am just saying I will win at the end.
Remember:  I can do the same things that you, and wearing high heels, make
up and dress.  And I am much more 'troll' and 'hard headed' than you can be
in this life and in all next lives, if they exist, hihi!  :D
I can be more boring and repetitive than you, my dear Juan, and I am
Brazilian.  Our national motto is "I am Brazilian and I never give up"
("Eu sou brasileiro/a e não desisto nunca"), hahaha!!!  ;D
Have a lovely night and sweet dreams, my dear!  Try the serotonin and
endorphins thing!  Your body will thank you!  <3
PS:  -  You are a _without fuck¡ng_ boring and grumpy old sir, but I still
like you, Juan.  A bit less, but I still would give you a cupuaçu

I never said that exploding a city is a "beautiful thing".  I was not

Tsk, tsk...  Oh, my dear Master Y-Oda, your suggestions are a disgrace to
anarchists...  Bad, bad boy!  I will tell you horrible dad jokes and send
Justin Bieber lyrics until you stop being an anarchist disgrace!  ;)
Zen, I didn't know Master Y-Oda was here, but it was an unexpected joy.  I
call him 'FOdastico Mestre YOda'  (something like "F*cking Fantastic Master
YOda")  and several other strange names, because he is almost a "ninja
master" in several subjects, is a very practical person and has an awesome
sense of humor.
Yesterday, I wrote a long letter to a hackerspace and mentioned Master
Y-Oda as reference.  Believe me, you can not agree with his opinions and
suggestions, as I also do in some moments, but this guy does deserve our
respect, Zen.
Oda is able of discreetely trolling governments, always smiling and
listening to music.  Not necessarily good music, because we have pretty
different musical tastes in some moments, haha!!  ;D
He not only thinks out the box, he kicks the box, my dear.  Oda has an
amazing sense of humor, a fantastic intelligence, a strong personality and
a lovely hair.  Not so gorgeous as ryziek's hair, of course, but I love Oda
and all the things that make him so special.  Kind soul, practical actions,
unexpected ideas, creative hackings, dark sense of humor and beautiful hair
included, haha!!  ;D
Governments, police, teachers and my own parents can't make me stop an
argument.  Oda can do it just saying "Stop, Ceci".  I think it shows you
how much I respect him.  I have good reasons for it, Zen.
He was trying to help.  If you didn't appreciate his suggestions, believe
me, he absolutely doesn't care.  The same about being an anarchist
disgrace, hihi!  ;)

that he'll bring you back to the tor list for your ""service"" (and don't
tell me you didn't think about that opening this thread.Oh no. You just
wanted to "open" our eyes to the goodness in boyce. oops).
No, I was just thinking about hardcore wild and hot sex with a guy who
hates me.  All that I want in my life is flirting with Boyce in public,
using the cpunks list.  Oh, the way he banned me was so sexy, Alex...  How
about telling everybody I was doing "ludicrous rape apologetics" in his
inbox?  Wow, it was really exciting!  Learn with him how to seduce a woman,
my dear!  :-)
Hahaha, talking seriously now...  Alex, my dear, what is the problem with
you in the last weeks?  Your last messages had more "f*ck this, f*ck that"
than my whole sexual life, you are much more aggressive than usual and you
simply didn't read the message content, silly boy!  :-/
When I forwarded the message, I was trying:
1)  to annoy Juan a bit.  I like him a lot and he knows it.
2)  to ask for some help for Lina, showing her thread in another list
(Liberation Tech).  Both, list and thread,can be interesting for some
people here, I suppose.
3)  to prove that even Boyce is able of good things, like _everybody_ in
this world.
I have a lot of things in common with Hitler, Alex.  I am a vegetarian who
loves children, animals, books, painting and German people too.  Am I a bad
person because of my preferences?  :-)
Boyce wrote to Lina in private, not in public, giving her a suggestion.  I
really appreciate kind and spontaneous support acts.  The fact he used
three sentences doesn't care.  In some moments, three simple words are
enough.  Some people can write books without saying something really
relevant.  Writing a lot doesn't mean anything, Alex.
I don't know if Boyce is a member of cpunks list or not, but it doesn't
care.  I don't want to be part of tor-talk list again and I know he is too
proud to apologize for being injust with his stupid allegations of rape
You don't know me enough, Alex.  Don't try to judge my acts using your way
of thinking as measure, please.  We are very different.
I don't know what "PR" means, but I probably will be annoied with you if I
search for its meaning.  I really did not understand the "service" part,
but I am sure you were so injust as Boyce.  Congratulations, Alexander.
You did it like a boss...  whoops, a Boyce!  ;)

The Latin word "mal"  (or "malus"),  used as root in several Latin
languages, means “bad” or “evil".  It was used in the origins of the words
"malice" and "malicious".
The etymology of this word makes explicit its meaning.  It is a "malicious
software".  An intentionally harmful software.
If you want to believe a "malware" can be a "goodware"  - or something
similar -  because people are good, is your option, but it definitely is

they're really good guys. We cannot deny the FBI employees gainful
employment which provides them opportunities for honourable actions. At
least some of the time. At least, I assume so.
The people are good, but we have trolls and stupid persons in all places.
A good person can be really stupid, did you know it?  We can have stupid
people even in respected lists of discussion.  :-)
Recent examples in this list:  -  People saying I am making "rape apology"
when I am trying to stop a stupid lynch mob and severe human rights
violation.  People saying how "beautiful and artistic" was using a nuclear
bomb to explode the city where my family used living before being killed.
People saying I was flattering a guy just because of a stupid mailing list.

The removal of content is happening since last month, my dear Lots of strange things are happening and there is evident censorship in
some places when you mention Jake's name.
This kind of thing makes me feel really upset and I am considering if was
correct to avoid cruel gossip, because it is disgusting, vile.  "JA group"
used this kind of despicable resource, but they are not a good and healthy
reference for normal people, with a little bit of ethics.  "Decent people",
using Quinn's favorite expression.  "Sane people", in my own code of ethics.
I never asked Jake about this fact, because it would sound disgusting and
non sense for him and he already has lots of more relevant worries.  I used
this embarrassing information for my personal conviction only.
We can't use this information in a trial, but I am sure he had no sexual
contact or approach with one of the alleged victims because he has a very
sensitive nose.
Jake is very clean and really cares a lot about personal hygiene.
Everybody knows how much he cares about his apparence and his smell always
is good, even after a longer talk.  A comfortable smell that remembers me
"cleanliness", daily baths and use of cleaning products, like soap,
shampoo, etc.
It is an important detail for a Brazilian person.  We do love water and
baths.  Brazilians usually are considered "bath addicteds" and "maniacs for
cleanliness, hygiene products and perfums" in whole world.
The girl is knowed in some activist circles for _not_ having an accurate
hygiene and for several disgusting intimate smells.  One of her ex-lovers,
who I've knowed in person, confirmed me it some weeks ago and I really felt
bad for her.
I don't know her in person and I don't know if she has a disease or just
unsanitary, unhygienic habits, but being associated with "sour cream",
"rotten cheese" and other bizarre odors is very humilliating.  He never had
courage to lick any part of her body and left her after two disastrous
sexual meetings.
Jake never would touch a stinky person in an intimate way.  He is too clean
for it and he could have sex with a better person very, very easily.
Sorry, I can't believe it.  He probably would reject her sexual advances,
exactly like her ex-lover did.
She is a revengeful person and, well, a rejected woman is the Hell in a
human form.  She said his ex-lover is gay and he doesn't like sex to some
people.  He is not gay and likes sex a lot, but only with clean women.  Not
her case!  :P
It was childish and cruel, but I confess when I was angry, I tried to play
with two horrible versions of "Smelly Cat"  (one of Phoebe' songs, Friends
sitcom),  provisionally called "Smelly Pussy" and "Smelly Little Cat" just
for making Jake laugh a bit.  It was a bad idea and I left it at all.  Jake
deserves good music and I sing like a banshee dying, uh!  :((
(I don't know if it is really used, but they teach a pussy is a "little
cat" for foreign people and I just learned it can be a bad word when I
tried to explain how much I love puppies and kittens to my ex-boyfriend.  I
said "I love pussies" and he laughed for a long time before explaining my
mistake...  d'oh!  :P)
Tender kisses.  Wish you all a lovely day!  :*
Cecilia, at hospital, in a horrible mood...  I've spent my whole week
visiting hospitals and strongly wished to die all the times after reading
dramatic Russian propaganda.  Too much drama and noise because of another
corrupt politician, who doesn't support LGBTQ rights and censors
philosophers, aff...  :(((
PS for   -  Stallman certainly likes scumbags, because is a
complete scumbag in some moments.  But I swear he is very funny and cute

I don't know if Jesus loves  but later I will share a cute comic book
named "Religion - Ruining Everything Since 4004 B.C.".  A lovely friend
sent me and I read it yesterday, at hospital, while complaining about God's
dark humor and bad jokes.
It was published under a Creative Commons license and I need to thank the
author for being so generous and fun.  He made me smile while my
temperamental body was rejecting medicines, so his book is good, hihi...  ;)

You are the kind of guy who prefers to ask about "little bits" in public

Zenaan and Alexander,
It's fun in some moments, but I decided to avoid feeding dumb trolls.  Time
and patience are very limited resources, so it probably will be my last
message for you both.  You are really boring, meh!  :(
Sorry, I don't respect dumb, stupid and pretentious people, with a huge
complex of superiority and an ego bigger than Putin's baldness.
But if you both want to complain about who has the biggest ego, please,
always remember:  -  I am fabulous, b¡tches.  You both are donkeys, I am a
colorful unicorn.  You walk, I parade.  You will be dust, I will be
glitter!  <3
Hahaha!!  Just joking for the lulz, but remember I am a professional troll
and you both are begginners and not so smart.  ;)
I am not a pig, but I prefer being juicy, tasty bacon than repulsive
Vegemite.  And I really love pearls.  They look great with dresses and high
heels.  Very classy!  <3
At least, I am really happy, because Zenaan finally stopped writing me in
private and copying me in every stupid message sent to a person of this
group.  It was ridiculous and non sense, but he spent more than a month to
perceive he was being ignored and/or rejected.  Very slow and disgusting
guy, ugh!  :(((
Happy oink, oink for you both!  (ˆ(oo)ˆ)
Cecilia, adopting Zen Chinchilla Philosophy from now on, hihi...  ;)
PS 1:  -  A person who really cares about another person, at least, try to
write correctly their name.  The problem was not misspelling Georgi's name,
but showing you simply don't care about him, even after spending zillions
of words trying to prove you really care about others.  Pure
contradiction.  "D'oh!" again, slow guy.
PS 2:  -  You probably will appreciate the "Zen Chinchilla Philosophy",
Mirimir.  Some years ago, I adapted an idea just to annoy a stupid guy and
used a chinchilla as example.  It worked well, but I should write a "Zen
Chichilla Manifesto" just for fun.  You know, I am so cute as a
chinchilla.  But  - thank God! -  not so furry, haha!!  ;D
Repeating:  -  Please, if I die in the next days, tell everybody that all
these disgusting and repetitive messages licking Putin's b at lls, ignoring
all the Russian government's fails, and against "The West", "The Empire",
etc, etc, killed me with infinite and painful boredom, ugh!  It's a cruel
torture, a real crime against the humanity!  :P
But, well, everything in Australia wants to kill you.  Aparently, also
Zenaan, even when pretending to be an eternal misunderstood victim of
society's ignorance.  Oh, poor Zen!  :'(

They are not totally secure apps, but certainly are a bit better than
whatsapp.  I am a fan of Durov brothers' work, but I am still waiting for

if the things become worst in Ankara, maybe could you consider to know
Brazil in person?  I am not interesting, but my neighbour is the always

I always say things like "Thank God I am Atheist!", but I sincerely try to
respect people's faith and, even considering God's existence very
uncertain, I always ask to God protect my loved ones.  It isn't a logical
thing, but I feel more comfortable because I know I can't protect my family
and my friends in all the moments.  Hope God, if exists, can love and feel
compassion for every single person in this crazy world.
I have Muslim friends and I was very frustrated yesterday because I've
found a Brazilian Telegram group saying awful, disgusting things about the
Islamism.  All the religions are about love.  There are crazy radical
people in all the religions and being a Christian doesn't mean anything.
It was very disgusting seeing so many people using Jesus and the Bible as
excuses to offend and to attack other persons, aff...  :((

Off-Topic: Donald Trump's and Vladimir Putin's Shared Agenda Should Alarm
Anyone Concerned About Democracy
        In brief: In his business dealings, He, Trump seems
        increasingly dependent on money from Russia and from the
        former Soviet republics within its increasingly active sphere
        of influence. This is because most of the big banks on this
        side of the pond won't go near him without HazMat suits. (Gee,
        could it be that his sudden emergence as a Warren-esque
        crusader against the "rigged system" of the banksters is less
        of a principled opposition and simply pure animal vengeance?
        Unpossible!) As Marshall points out, this isn't exactly a deep
        corporate secret ... Marshall presents a judicious but
        comprehensive bill of indictment as regards He, Trump's
        relationship with Putin. He doesn't allege direct complicity,
        only a mutuality of interest that should alarm anyone
        concerned about the stability of American democracy. He also
        carefully traces the connections to Russia of several of He,
        Trump's crucial advisors. (I knew about Paul Manafort's
        connection to Putin's Ukrainian marionette, but the
        relationship that Carter Page, one of the campaign's key
        foreign-policy advisers, to Gazprom, the Russian energy
        behemoth that Putin controls, was a new one for me.) He shies
        away from the more baroque conspiracy theories, although I
        don't think the notion that Russian intelligence was behind
        the hack-and-release of 20,000 internal DNC e-mails at exactly
        the right time is that far-fetched.  This should be the only
        story about the Trump campaign until he comes clean.

I don't know exactly what is happening, but received some strange private
messages in different channels about Wikileaks.  Err...  Why me?  Did
someone say something or is just my famous oriental charm?  :-/
Usually, I love Wikileaks, but I do not support some of their last
actions.  Everybody knows about strange leaks to manage USA elections, the
Turkish leaks and deleted bizarre tweets.  These things annoyed me a lot.
I wasn't tweeting in the last times, but, few days ago, I admiss I tweeted
about    and retweeted one of Wikileaks' account
tweets about Jake.  Just it.
Only a cordial relationship between an institucional account and a poor
unknowed follower, who had lost a lot of friends, contacts and followers in
last months.  I am only lurking on twitter, avoiding flaming wars and
boring people.  No much patience for all the drama.
It's my usual behaviour in foreign lists too.  I only broke my typical
pattern because of Jake.  I was already an old reader here and on tor-talk
list, before being kickbanned.  I am very noisy and chaotical, and my
English stinks more than someone's... little cat!  So, silence is always
more comfortable for me, even being a talkative troll.  :)
Am I guilty of some of their bad leaks and was not informed about it yet?
They were noisy and chaotical, but not mine!  :)
Ah, I always make a lot of strange things, but not personalized panties.
If you want Snodew or Assange panties, you can suggest the idea to
Wikileaks.  Certainly they will be very sexy, but not like the charming
"Put in" panties, hihi!  :)
It would be fun to use Tor Project panties.  I still use their stickers in
my notebooks and devices, even after all this mess.  It's a pity that
g-strings have no much area to onions or Schneier facts, hahaha!!!  ;D

Definitely, without any doubt, I am the world's worst programmer, but this
kind of thing is pure love, ow!  *-*
I love esoteric programming languages and "hello world" using ArnoldC is
pretty cute!  I didn't know this language!  <3
But this is my favorite language, the only one that makes me feel like a
great ninja programmer, yay!!!  :D
Unnecessary is an esoteric programming language. The language is named
'Unnecessary' because of the method this programming language works: the
source file is unnecessary; in fact the existence of source code file leads
to critical error. In case of critical error the interpreter must stop
immediately and report the error.
Unnecessary has no instructions/commands. You can do nothing with this
language, so using it is unnecessary as well. The whole Unnecessary program
is NOP. Or actually, there should be no Unnecessary programs, since only
valid Unnecessary program is a non-existing source code file.
The goal was to create a programming language that is easy to learn, not
very useful, doesn't require input or do output, has no memory, has no
instructions. Only an interpreter is required. As well, good thing is that
distributing Unnecessary programs is extremely easy, and can be done
without computers. As well, storage is no problem: you can have infinite
amount of Unnecessary programs in a memory bit. Actually, storing them
requires less memory than a bit.
Every valid program, however, is a quine. That's the only possible program,
and the only valid form of program. In Unnecessary creating a null quine
doesn't even require the existence of the empty program file, as in other
languages. Has programming ever been easier?(Not to mention that it isn't
even possible to write anything else than bug-free code!)
Oh, and the valid Unnecessary program file extension is "unn".

Zenaan, my dear, your country serves Vegemite to children.  It's a pretty
serious crime against humanity and it occurs daily, in all Australian
It has lots of sodium, a disgusting flavour and stinks more than my
disastrous homemade Sauerkraut.  Am I saying "Hail Australia", Land of
Vegemite and Home of Crocodilo Dundee?  :-)
This crime was horrible, really shocking and sad, but the point is
recognizing publicly the existence of a repulsive crime and never more
permiss that something similar occurs in the whole world, not just
criticizing a country.  Sorry, it doesn't make sense.
I do love my country, but it never will be a blind stupid love.  There are
lots of disgusting crimes here and also in your country, in the USA, in
Russia, in the whole world.  No exceptions.
The USA are not my favorite country, but it was not a regional problem.
Violent crimes happen in every single country of this world, including
Russia.  Please, remember it.
Ah, for your knowledge, I hate all the governments, including Russian.  No
exceptions here too.  As Mirimir, I love Russian people, but it is too much
innocence believing that Russian government is better than North-American
government.  Both are disgusting.

USA killed great part of my dad's family.  They used nuclear weapons to
destroy lifes and cities.  Japan was already deeply destroied when they
decided to test their nuclear bombs.  My dad's family used to live in
Hiroshima.  You know what happened with them.
My mom always says it was racism, that US probably would use the bombs in
some oriental country or in Africa anyway, because oriental people and
black people are always considered inferior people there.  They are not
Caucasian, they are different physically, they have different ways of
being, beliefs, religions, food, etc.
Well, the problem is not North American prejudice, but all the prejudices.
All the people have difficulties to understand, to accept and to respect
differences, to manage their personal references.
USA and Germany used the war as an excuse to test their new toys playing
with human lifes.  Japan, Italy, England, France, all the other countries
didn't do the same just because they had not 'new toys' or they probably
had played with them in a cruel way too.
The problem was not the country, but all the wars.  There are lots of good
people in all the countries, in all the places.  A country is not a villain
or the good guy, Zenaan.  Russia is not better than USA.  They are
different countries and have different backgrounds.  Both deserves respect.
It would not be rational to hate USA for killing my family.  Lots of people
there also lost their families in that stupid and cruel war.  I need to
hate all the wars,governments, bad people, cruelty and lies, not USA.
(Certainly, mosquitos too.  Maybe also Vegemite.)
Take care, everybody!  Have a lovely weekend and lots of love and fun!  <3

list. You saw what kind of garbage the boyces and the quinns posted here.
And you are still making excuses for "the land of the free"?
I admiss I didn't like Boyce, Dani Moth, Quinn and Ted's messages, but I am
not "making excuses" for their country, Juan.
Ted was the most aggressive of all and I think he was talking only about
Zenaan and you, but he seems _a lot_ the kind of guy who shoots in
someone's head saying that some people "deserves" it for being different.
I was really shocked after reading his messages.
Boyce's act of banning was disgusting, but what really upset me was the
"rape apology" stuff.  It was completely unnecessary and pretty sick
knowing my past and details of my present.  But, well, everybody knows his
ego is much bigger than his intelligence.  He is an intelligent guy, but is
very pretentious.  It always was usual inside Tor Project core team.  He
follows their patterns.
In that occasion, I admiss I hoped sincerely that Boyce and Dani Moth were
raped twice each one, because only a person who _really_  was raped can be
completely sure that making "rape apology" always will be impossible for
I love sex.  Rape is not sex, it is violence, fury, torture.  It's dark.
It is to feel a dark and deep fear of death.  Usually, I don't feel fear of
death.  It is the only certainty in this uncertain life.  I swear I felt
the same desperate fear of death when I was raped.
Nobody deserves to feel this kind of despair.  I was angry in that occasion
and I sincerely apologize for wishing something so cruel for Boyce and
Dani.  I regret it a lot and ask pardon for being like them.  It is not
correct at all.
Quinn is intolerant and has narrow patterns of decency, but he is a good
person and I like him, Juan.  You are not exactly tolerant and open-minded
too, haha!!  ;D
Americans who believe the use of nuclear weapons was justified is now 56%,
with 34% saying it was not. "
Sorry, I don't believe in all researches because I have lots of researchers
as friends and colleagues and I was a researcher in several moments of my
life too, my dear Juan.  And you know, I am terribly hard headed like you,
haha!!  ;D
It was a political decision, not military, Juan.  In all the countries, in
all the places, the problem is the government, not the people.
Few stupid and cruel politicians killed my family, not the North American
people.  There are lots of infinitely sad ghosts stories in Hiroshima.
Shadows and eternal crying...  I sincerely hope these sad ghosts haunt all
the cruel politicians who decided to play with human lives.
My migraine is still killing me and my mood is really bad.  I don't like
drugs, but tried a lots of medicines for pain in last days.  My hard head
and I think they didn't work, haha!!  ;D
I bet you will feel envy now, Juan.  Coconut ice cream and sweet corn ice
cream, nom nom...  Trying usual food will be a disaster.  Ice cream is a
good choice when feeling sick.  My mood will be better soon, hihi...  <3
I was thinking about lemon and ginger popsicles, much better for sickness,
but they had only creamy ice creams now.  So, I will make tea.  Hot and
cold together, hihi...  <3
You are a good person, my dear Juan.  I was wrong about Razer and you being
a couple in love.  Now I hope you, Razer and Mirimir can make a lovely
ménage à trois and being happy forever, hahaha!!!  ;D
Nope, I am sick and you are too far to kick my butt like a soccer ball...

The same way there are lots of awesome persons in all the countries, there

Well, I am sure Quinn thinks exactly the same thing all the times when I

I never said that I am tolerant and open-minded, Juan.  Sorry if you felt
offended with my words.  I don't support any kind of 'nazis'.  Radical
people are extremely boring.

several moments of my life too
Hmm...  Sorry, after talking about deaths, wars and rapes, I confess I was
thinking only in Portuguese.  Always is the most comfortable language for
Pardon, reading now what wrote yesterday, there are more mistakes and I
didn't write some words when talking about the rapes.  Both made me feel
the same way, the same deep panic of death, the same smell of fear.  Sorry

"Eu não acredito em todas as pesquisas" here doesn't mean necessarily that
I really do _not_ believe in _all_ researches.  If I really wouldn't
believe in all researches, in Portuguese, I would use 'double negative',
what doesn't exist in English, sorry.  I would say "Eu não acredito em
nenhuma pesquisa", Juan.  I simply translated - literally - what I thought
in that moment and doesn't make sense in English, sorry.
I was trying to say that not necessarily I believe in all researches, that
I don't believe in some of them...  Does it sound better now or should I

Juan, you and Quinn are not my friends, but I appreciate both.  Certainly
not enough to invite you to visit my house or to borrow money and books,
but I like you both.  :)
A fool example, I have friends who believe in God in a blind way and also
extremely Atheists friends.  They are good persons and I sincerely respect
all of them.  They have different personal beliefs, but they all have good
character and are intelligent.
of shit like quinn is a good guy. Since you believe that, your moral
judgements are a bad joke...which shows what you really stand for.
He is a good person.  Too moralist and intollerant for being my friend, but
he is a good person.
You are a good person, but very aggressive in some moments and pretty
intollerant too.
Uff...  Juan, you seem to know more about me than myself to judge me so bad
in all the moments.  Please, what do I really stand for?
evil intentions or acts. As to being 'open minded', again, I'm certainly
not open minded to stupidity. Being 'open minded' to stupidity is hardly a

any kind of 'nazis'.  Radical people are extremely boring.
the nazis were not that they were radicals. Or that they were 'boring'...
I was not talking about nazism, only about extremely radical people:
feminazis, vegan nazis, econazis, etc.  Sorry, at least for me, radical
people are always boring and/or annoing.
ignore this particular poll because it doesn't paint the americunts in a
good light. But the poll is completely consistent with americunt 'culture'.
If anything the real numbers are prolly higher.
Juan, it hurts me a lot because it is a pool about my family's death, not
because "doesn't paint the americans in a good light".  It would hurt me
the same if it was a pool about French people opinion, if it was a pool
about Chinese people opinion...  The problem is thinking about people
saying that it was correct to use nuclear weapons to kill people.
And, please, always remember that laws, sausages and researches are not
made in a beautiful way.  I don't trust in all researchers that I've

comments I've made here. Same thing for quinn. All we know about him is
that he's a totalitarian american shitbag. Whatever your personal
connection to him is, (if any) it's irrelevant here.
Why are you so sure about it, my dear Juan?  You never will know exactly
what I know, hihi...  Nobody can know _exactly_ what another person knows.
Never forget it, my dear.  :-)
that quinn is a 'good' person too, since we represent completely opposed
views of what 'good' means.
My dear Juan, I am talking about MY subjetive impressions about persons in
general.  Why can't you accept that I don't think exactly what you want I
think?  :(((
Is it so offensive for you if I have my own opinion and it is different
than yours?  Why are you trying to impose me your opinion like a dictator?
Please, you say to be an 'anarchist', so be coherent.  You say I am a
'retard', but I am an honest retard and you are not being honest, if you
really are an anarchist.
I didn't try to impose you my opinion.  I simply told you what I think
about you, and people, and about countries, wars, whatever...  I never said
my words are an 'absolute truth' or that I never will be wrong...
Hey!  Don't you respect a person's beliefs?  Why do you think a religious
person is a liar?  :P
Not necessarily.  Even using Math or Physics, nobody can prove the
existence or not of a God (or Gods, or Godess, or Godesses, whatever).  If
God exists, it is not a lie.
There are several religions and holy books, but there is not an
unambiguous, definitive interpretation of God, Juan.  Sincerely?  I don't
trust religions and holy books, but I tried to study lots and lots of
possibilities when younger.  Reviews?  Always is about love.  Trying to be
a good person and avoiding to be a bad person is enough.
(I am not talking about being a 'saint' or something similar.  Just
avoiding to be a son of a b¡tch is enough and God and/or the people will
sincerely appreciate your efforts!  :-)
I know, infinitely subjetive points of view, different backgrounds and ways
of being, etc, etc...  Part of world's beauty is how different can be the
persons.  Some people explode cities using nuclear weapons, some people try
to build a whole new world...  :-)
Oh, good!  hihi...  :-)
'good' utopian governments that do stuff that you think is 'good', like, I
don't know 'free' schooling for poor children.
You already know what I think about governments.  I don't support them.
making sure...before pointing out that you are in no position to call me
'aggressive' or 'intolerant'.
Only limited and/or stupid people respect labels.  A person is much more
than empty labels.  Persons are their acts, their thoughts, their words,
not the labels they like to use in society.
If you want to use the "anarchist" label, the problem is yours, not mine.
I hate governments, but I really think it is very limited to say "Oh, I am
Instead just talking about being a proud anarchist in lists, mimimi
mimimi, do something real to destroy governments.  "Talking is cheap, show
me the code", do you remember?  I am doing my part instead consider myself
an anarchist.
I only make jokes using 'vegan' and 'veggie' labels to explain that I don't
eat meat and I don't like to kill animals, because the people really have
serious problems to understand my reasons and it is easier to use a stupid
already knowed label than spending time explaining all my actions.  Nobody
seems to care enough to see my acts, they just want to know my labels and
judge them.
Sorry, if I need to say "Oh, Juan, I am anarchist" to be accepted for you,
we never will be friends.  See my actions and who I am instead trying to
impose your opinion with offenses.  :P
Uff...  God, I didn't say you are wrong.  It was an hypothesis.  Please,
think instead being so defensive.
and irrelevant thought?
I was answering to your comment, Juan.  Please, read again what you wrote
before.  My thoughts are so 'irrelevant' as yours.  Or do you *really*
think that everything you wrote is relevant for someone?  Sorry, the world
doesn't work this way!  :-)
Believe me, nobody says only 'relevant' things.  First of all, because
'relevance' is pretty subjective.  An important thing for me not
necessarily will be relevant for me, and vice versa.
respect they deserve?
Uff...  Juan, did you really read what I wrote before?  I am too lazy to
repeat everything again!  :(((
Sorry, I will stop to spend your time and also mine, Juan.  Believe me, we
both will be banned again if we make an infinite discussion here and I
certainly will win in the end.
I am not saying that I am right.  I am just saying I will win at the end.
Remember:  I can do the same things that you, and wearing high heels, make
up and dress.  And I am much more 'troll' and 'hard headed' than you can be
in this life and in all next lives, if they exist, hihi!  :D
I can be more boring and repetitive than you, my dear Juan, and I am
Brazilian.  Our national motto is "I am Brazilian and I never give up"
("Eu sou brasileiro/a e não desisto nunca"), hahaha!!!  ;D

Tsk, tsk...  Oh, my dear Master Y-Oda, your suggestions are a disgrace to
anarchists...  Bad, bad boy!  I will tell you horrible dad jokes and send
Justin Bieber lyrics until you stop being an anarchist disgrace!  ;)
Zen, I didn't know Master Y-Oda was here, but it was an unexpected joy.  I
call him 'FOdastico Mestre YOda'  (something like "F*cking Fantastic Master
YOda")  and several other strange names, because he is almost a "ninja
master" in several subjects, is a very practical person and has an awesome
sense of humor.
Yesterday, I wrote a long letter to a hackerspace and mentioned Master
Y-Oda as reference.  Believe me, you can not agree with his opinions and
suggestions, as I also do in some moments, but this guy does deserve our
respect, Zen.
Oda is able of discreetely trolling governments, always smiling and
listening to music.  Not necessarily good music, because we have pretty
different musical tastes in some moments, haha!!  ;D
He not only thinks out the box, he kicks the box, my dear.  Oda has an
amazing sense of humor, a fantastic intelligence, a strong personality and
a lovely hair.  Not so gorgeous as ryziek's hair, of course, but I love Oda
and all the things that make him so special.  Kind soul, practical actions,
unexpected ideas, creative hackings, dark sense of humor and beautiful hair
included, haha!!  ;D
Governments, police, teachers and my own parents can't make me stop an
argument.  Oda can do it just saying "Stop, Ceci".  I think it shows you
how much I respect him.  I have good reasons for it, Zen.
He was trying to help.  If you didn't appreciate his suggestions, believe
me, he absolutely doesn't care.  The same about being an anarchist
disgrace, hihi!  ;)

list. Wau. It proves so much.
that he'll bring you back to the tor list for your ""service"" (and don't
tell me you didn't think about that opening this thread.Oh no. You just
wanted to "open" our eyes to the goodness in boyce. oops).
No, I was just thinking about hardcore wild and hot sex with a guy who
hates me.  All that I want in my life is flirting with Boyce in public,
using the cpunks list.  Oh, the way he banned me was so sexy, Alex...  How
about telling everybody I was doing "ludicrous rape apologetics" in his
inbox?  Wow, it was really exciting!  Learn with him how to seduce a woman,
my dear!  :-)
Hahaha, talking seriously now...  Alex, my dear, what is the problem with
you in the last weeks?  Your last messages had more "f*ck this, f*ck that"
than my whole sexual life, you are much more aggressive than usual and you
simply didn't read the message content, silly boy!  :-/
When I forwarded the message, I was trying:
1)  to annoy Juan a bit.  I like him a lot and he knows it.
2)  to ask for some help for Lina, showing her thread in another list
(Liberation Tech).  Both, list and thread,can be interesting for some
people here, I suppose.
3)  to prove that even Boyce is able of good things, like _everybody_ in
this world.
I have a lot of things in common with Hitler, Alex.  I am a vegetarian who
loves children, animals, books, painting and German people too.  Am I a bad
person because of my preferences?  :-)
Boyce wrote to Lina in private, not in public, giving her a suggestion.  I
really appreciate kind and spontaneous support acts.  The fact he used
three sentences doesn't care.  In some moments, three simple words are
enough.  Some people can write books without saying something really
relevant.  Writing a lot doesn't mean anything, Alex.
I don't know if Boyce is a member of cpunks list or not, but it doesn't
care.  I don't want to be part of tor-talk list again and I know he is too
proud to apologize for being injust with his stupid allegations of rape
You don't know me enough, Alex.  Don't try to judge my acts using your way
of thinking as measure, please.  We are very different.
I don't know what "PR" means, but I probably will be annoied with you if I
search for its meaning.  I really did not understand the "service" part,
but I am sure you were so injust as Boyce.  Congratulations, Alexander.
You did it like a boss...  whoops, a Boyce!  ;)
Hihi...  Take care, silly boy.  :-)

act according to their schooling and training and upbringing, as best they
can - they're just doing their jobs you see.
The Latin word "mal"  (or "malus"),  used as root in several Latin
languages, means “bad” or “evil".  It was used in the origins of the words
"malice" and "malicious".
The etymology of this word makes explicit its meaning.  It is a "malicious
software".  An intentionally harmful software.
If you want to believe a "malware" can be a "goodware"  - or something
similar -  because people are good, is your option, but it definitely is
*not* a wise choice, in my humble opinion.

act according to their schooling and training and upbringing, as best they
can - they're just doing their jobs you see. I hear that some supporters of
the FBI are actually volunteers (friends of employees just helping out), so
they're really good guys. We cannot deny the FBI employees gainful
employment which provides them opportunities for honourable actions. At
least some of the time. At least, I assume so.
The people are good, but we have trolls and stupid persons in all places.
A good person can be really stupid, did you know it?  We can have stupid
people even in respected lists of discussion.  :-)
Recent examples in this list:  -  People saying I am making "rape apology"
when I am trying to stop a stupid lynch mob and severe human rights
violation.  People saying how "beautiful and artistic" was using a nuclear
bomb to explode the city where my family used living before being killed.
People saying I was flattering a guy just because of a stupid mailing list.
You know, we have disgusting people telling lies and writing stupid things,
making propaganda for corrupt politicians and institutions in every place
of this world, all minutes.  Even on the best mailing and discussion
lists.  And they never apologize when are injust.

Russian propaganda is always so interesting and useful...  yawn...  (-_-)
Psychopaths are opportunist guys, able of really disgusting acts  -
supporting other psychopaths, like Donald Trump, for example -  just for

Exactly what Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong-un did few months ago, do you
remember?  If not, search about.
You should search about KGB methods of torture and about Russian LGBTQ
rights too, please.  Putin has much more in common with Trump and CIA than
you would like to know.
Oh, and when it is convenient, Putin really appreciate USA a lot!!!  :D
Psychopaths never are very coherent, because they care only about their own
interests, not about real values and honor.
Please, consider using the "Put In panties" all the times when making PR
for Putin.  The Russian government will appreciate your cute act of
tenderness and the propaganda will be more effective, really unforgettable

The removal of content is happening since last month, my dear Lots of strange things are happening and there is evident censorship in
some places when you mention Jake's name.
This kind of thing makes me feel really upset and I am considering if was
correct to avoid cruel gossip, because it is disgusting, vile.  "JA group"
used this kind of despicable resource, but they are not a good and healthy
reference for normal people, with a little bit of ethics.  "Decent people",
using Quinn's favorite expression.  "Sane people", in my own code of ethics.
I never asked Jake about this fact, because it would sound disgusting and
non sense for him and he already has lots of more relevant worries.  I used
this embarrassing information for my personal conviction only.
We can't use this information in a trial, but I am sure he had no sexual
contact or approach with one of the alleged victims because he has a very
sensitive nose.
Jake is very clean and really cares a lot about personal hygiene.
Everybody knows how much he cares about his apparence and his smell always
is good, even after a longer talk.  A comfortable smell that remembers me
"cleanliness", daily baths and use of cleaning products, like soap,
shampoo, etc.
It is an important detail for a Brazilian person.  We do love water and
baths.  Brazilians usually are considered "bath addicteds" and "maniacs for
cleanliness, hygiene products and perfums" in whole world.
The girl is knowed in some activist circles for _not_ having an accurate
hygiene and for several disgusting intimate smells.  One of her ex-lovers,
who I've knowed in person, confirmed me it some weeks ago and I really felt
bad for her.
I don't know her in person and I don't know if she has a disease or just
unsanitary, unhygienic habits, but being associated with "sour cream",
"rotten cheese" and other bizarre odors is very humilliating.  He never had
courage to lick any part of her body and left her after two disastrous
sexual meetings.
Jake never would touch a stinky person in an intimate way.  He is too clean
for it and he could have sex with a better person very, very easily.
Sorry, I can't believe it.  He probably would reject her sexual advances,
exactly like her ex-lover did.
She is a revengeful person and, well, a rejected woman is the Hell in a
human form.  She said his ex-lover is gay and he doesn't like sex to some
people.  He is not gay and likes sex a lot, but only with clean women.  Not
her case!  :P
It was childish and cruel, but I confess when I was angry, I tried to play
with two horrible versions of "Smelly Cat"  (one of Phoebe' songs, Friends
sitcom),  provisionally called "Smelly Pussy" and "Smelly Little Cat" just
for making Jake laugh a bit.  It was a bad idea and I left it at all.  Jake
deserves good music and I sing like a banshee dying, uh!  :((
(I don't know if it is really used, but they teach a pussy is a "little
cat" for foreign people and I just learned it can be a bad word when I
tried to explain how much I love puppies and kittens to my ex-boyfriend.  I
said "I love pussies" and he laughed for a long time before explaining my
mistake...  d'oh!  :P)
Tender kisses.  Wish you all a lovely day!  :*
Cecilia, at hospital, in a horrible mood...  I've spent my whole week
visiting hospitals and strongly wished to die all the times after reading
dramatic Russian propaganda.  Too much drama and noise because of another

It was published under a Creative Commons license and I need to thank the
author for being so generous and fun.  He made me smile while my

Zenaan and Alexander,
It's fun in some moments, but I decided to avoid feeding dumb trolls.  Time
and patience are very limited resources, so it probably will be my last
message for you both.  You are really boring, meh!  :(
Sorry, I don't respect dumb, stupid and pretentious people, with a huge
complex of superiority and an ego bigger than Putin's baldness.
But if you both want to complain about who has the biggest ego, please,
always remember:  -  I am fabulous, b¡tches.  You both are donkeys, I am a
colorful unicorn.  You walk, I parade.  You will be dust, I will be
glitter!  <3
Hahaha!!  Just joking for the lulz, but remember I am a professional troll
and you both are begginners and not so smart.  ;)
I am not a pig, but I prefer being juicy, tasty bacon than repulsive
Vegemite.  And I really love pearls.  They look great with dresses and high
heels.  Very classy!  <3
At least, I am really happy, because Zenaan finally stopped writing me in
private and copying me in every stupid message sent to a person of this
group.  It was ridiculous and non sense, but he spent more than a month to
perceive he was being ignored and/or rejected.  Very slow and disgusting
guy, ugh!  :(((
Happy oink, oink for you both!  (ˆ(oo)ˆ)
Cecilia, adopting Zen Chinchilla Philosophy from now on, hihi...  ;)
PS 1:  -  A person who really cares about another person, at least, try to
write correctly their name.  The problem was not misspelling Georgi's name,
but showing you simply don't care about him, even after spending zillions
of words trying to prove you really care about others.  Pure
contradiction.  "D'oh!" again, slow guy.
PS 2:  -  You probably will appreciate the "Zen Chinchilla Philosophy",
Mirimir.  Some years ago, I adapted an idea just to annoy a stupid guy and
used a chinchilla as example.  It worked well, but I should write a "Zen
Chichilla Manifesto" just for fun.  You know, I am so cute as a
chinchilla.  But  - thank God! -  not so furry, haha!!  ;D
Repeating:  -  Please, if I die in the next days, tell everybody that all
these disgusting and repetitive messages licking Putin's b at lls, ignoring
all the Russian government's fails, and against "The West", "The Empire",
etc, etc, killed me with infinite and painful boredom, ugh!  It's a cruel
torture, a real crime against the humanity!  :P
But, well, everything in Australia wants to kill you.  Aparently, also
Zenaan, even when pretending to be an eternal misunderstood victim of
society's ignorance.  Oh, poor Zen!  :'(

I always say things like "Thank God I am Atheist!", but I sincerely try to
respect people's faith and, even considering God's existence very
uncertain, I always ask to God protect my loved ones.  It isn't a logical
thing, but I feel more comfortable because I know I can't protect my family

compassion for every single person in this crazy world.
I have Muslim friends and I was very frustrated yesterday because I've
found a Brazilian Telegram group saying awful, disgusting things about the
Islamism.  All the religions are about love.  There are crazy radical

Off-Topic: Donald Trump's and Vladimir Putin's Shared Agenda Should Alarm
Anyone Concerned About Democracy
        In brief: In his business dealings, He, Trump seems
        increasingly dependent on money from Russia and from the
        former Soviet republics within its increasingly active sphere
        of influence. This is because most of the big banks on this
        side of the pond won't go near him without HazMat suits. (Gee,
        could it be that his sudden emergence as a Warren-esque
        crusader against the "rigged system" of the banksters is less
        of a principled opposition and simply pure animal vengeance?
        Unpossible!) As Marshall points out, this isn't exactly a deep
        corporate secret ... Marshall presents a judicious but
        comprehensive bill of indictment as regards He, Trump's
        relationship with Putin. He doesn't allege direct complicity,
        only a mutuality of interest that should alarm anyone
        concerned about the stability of American democracy. He also
        carefully traces the connections to Russia of several of He,
        Trump's crucial advisors. (I knew about Paul Manafort's
        connection to Putin's Ukrainian marionette, but the
        relationship that Carter Page, one of the campaign's key
        foreign-policy advisers, to Gazprom, the Russian energy
        behemoth that Putin controls, was a new one for me.) He shies
        away from the more baroque conspiracy theories, although I
        don't think the notion that Russian intelligence was behind
        the hack-and-release of 20,000 internal DNC e-mails at exactly
        the right time is that far-fetched.  This should be the only
        story about the Trump campaign until he comes clean.

"players" of these stories about the Tor Project.  It's a bad soap opera,
with bad actors.  I can answer strictly for me and about me, in this case.
Hmm...  Not exactly, dear.  I have a vagina, Juan.  It's natural for me
believe in sexism, because I live the sexism all the days.  Theoretically,
I should be considered an equal, but the world doesn't work this way.  And
it becomes even worse when bad people hide themselves behind politically
correct lies in a hypocritical society.
Hum, I will need chocolate too!  :-/

Hi, Digitalfolklore!
Hope you wanted to send this message to cypherpunks lists, not for me in
special.  :)
I don't know exactly what is happening, but received some strange private
messages in different channels about Wikileaks.  Err...  Why me?  Did
someone say something or is just my famous oriental charm?  :-/
Usually, I love Wikileaks, but I do not support some of their last
actions.  Everybody knows about strange leaks to manage USA elections, the
Turkish leaks and deleted bizarre tweets.  These things annoyed me a lot.
I wasn't tweeting in the last times, but, few days ago, I admiss I tweeted
about    and retweeted one of Wikileaks' account
tweets about Jake.  Just it.
Only a cordial relationship between an institucional account and a poor
unknowed follower, who had lost a lot of friends, contacts and followers in
last months.  I am only lurking on twitter, avoiding flaming wars and
boring people.  No much patience for all the drama.
It's my usual behaviour in foreign lists too.  I only broke my typical
pattern because of Jake.  I was already an old reader here and on tor-talk
list, before being kickbanned.  I am very noisy and chaotical, and my
English stinks more than someone's... little cat!  So, silence is always
more comfortable for me, even being a talkative troll.  :)
Am I guilty of some of their bad leaks and was not informed about it yet?
They were noisy and chaotical, but not mine!  :)
Ah, I always make a lot of strange things, but not personalized panties.
If you want Snodew or Assange panties, you can suggest the idea to
Wikileaks.  Certainly they will be very sexy, but not like the charming
"Put in" panties, hihi!  :)
It would be fun to use Tor Project panties.  I still use their stickers in
my notebooks and devices, even after all this mess.  It's a pity that
g-strings have no much area to onions or Schneier facts, hahaha!!!  ;D
There are Schneier Facts T-shirts, but cryptography in panties would be
awesome, wow!!!  Loved the idea!!! Ok, I will consider it just for fun!  <3

Meh, too childish...  It's becoming pretty boring!  :-/
Maybe a man can't see it, but even the most stupid woman in the world can
notice an evident *lie* in the last statment published.
The obvious efforts trying to adjust the accusations to being more
realistic and plausible, giving also more colours and emotions, are pretty
interesting.  I like it!  ;)
I didn't stop to search for some trustworthy information and for more
references in last days.
A programmer (woman) told me some 'juicy gossip' about one of alleged
victims, but it would be pretty disgusting to tell it here.  Ugh!  :-/
Well, in thesis, one of alleged victims is being hypocrite and hates
Jacob.  It was obvious since the first message, but some of the reasons
were unexpected for me, at least.  I need to search more information about
it and verify if it is really true before invite her to write a statment or
tell more about it in a trial.
Another tech woman, a brutally sincere friend who I love a lot and consider
one of the most intelligent persons that I know, perceived the lie that I
mentioned before I point it to her.  It simply does not make sense...  :-/
I always says my friend is a 'feminazi' who hates all the men and she knows
about it and says even worse things about me, hahaha!!  She is really
bitter sometimes, but pretty realistic and I do love extremely sincere
friends, haha!!  ;D
Well, she knows in person Jake, Isis and a lot of people mentioned and
doesn't like anyone.  None of them, I swear.  :P
Told me some stories about egocentrism, injured pride, politics, money,
etc, and asked me to avoid this kind of f*cking harmful crazy people
because I am too stupid to protect myself, haha!!  It makes sense, but now
I am curious about the truth, haha!!  ;D
She asked me to avoid meetings with one of alleged victims at any cost,
because "she is a f*cking sick jealous crazy b*tch", able of killing me and
tell lies about self-defense or psychotical breaks and lapses of memory in
public.  My friend is a bit neurotic, but is a good woman and is just
worried about me, hihi...  ;)
Just in case, the world is really small and I will contact one of the
ex-partners of this alleged victim in special.  I don't know him, but I
would like to know if she likes scandals, lies, breaking objects, this kind
of crazy stupid actions...  She has an ego much bigger than usual and I
know that Jake has the same problem, ugh!  :P

lovely messages about helping homeless people and two donations, yay!!!  ;D

I hate moderation, but I was and I am moderator in several lists, because I
am considered transparent and everybody can contact me easily, Juan.
My personal convictions about avoiding moderation at any cost, in a recent
past, had a really negative impact in one of the lists that I used to
moderate.  A poisounous guy made a real chaos in the discuss list.
It was a disaster because I knowed him in person and everybody knows I
really liked him a lot.  I wrote several advertising messages before put
him in moderated mode.  I never banned a person and he was the only person
that I put under moderation until now.
After being advertised about the moderation, he left a much more than 2.000
persons list, who always said "love too much", and offended me in several
personal channels, including cell phone and messengers.  I received dozens
of cruel messages telling about my friends' impressions about me.
After his disgusting messages for me, I was completely sure that I was
right choosing to moderate him and his destructive e-mails.  I was
protecting the readers of the list, Juan.  It was a proof of consideration

will lose credibility, respect and collaborators.  Their problems, not mine.
If censorship is OK 'sometimes', then she can't complain about being
censored 'sometimes', like 'this' time.
Sorry, I wanted to read the list and don't care about following rules to do
it, if necessary.  Social rules, for example:  - In the Summer, I really
prefer to be nude all the time, but I use clothes or I will be arrested.
Reading the tor-talk list is not possible because my personal positions are
different?  Ok, what could I wait of a guy who can't simply admiss that was
stupid, limited and cruel for calling a raped woman, a "ludicrous rape
I know it is a terrible bad karma, but I would love to graffitti these

Thank you, my dear, but it is not the same thing.  I want to be formaly
subscribed and receive aaaall the lovely messages in my inbox.  You know me
enough to understand my personal position, Juan.  :)
If the people behind ja.group are still subscribed, even after using two
fake accounts to humilliate and harass a person, why can't I be subscribed
too?  :)
Some of the people behind the lynch mob already told their names and they
are still in the tor-talk list.  Only two fake accounts were banned.  The
real accounts are normally subscribed.  Not fair, not reasonable.  It says
a lot about the moderation team's preferences.
If I had told lies using a fake account, my personal account would be still
protected and subscribed.  Instead, I decided to expose myself in an honest
way and I am being punished for not using a fake account to defend Jake.
You know, being sincere and transparent is not a valuable thing for
hypocrite people.
Do you remember the jokes that I told about my personal convictions, Juan?
I am millions of times more hard headed than you, my dear.  Just wait,
hihi!  :)

ignoring cases where women are actually hurt.
Yeah, I confess I was waiting for formal excuses because he is pretending
to be politically correct.  I am pretty disappointed.  He is a bad actor
and not much smart.  The lies about banned people using threats to
subscribe again were stranger than his disgusting offenses about rape
apology.  Sick guy, really disturbing, eeck!  :-/
Well, hope he learns how to fake better with his friends of ja.group.  It

Being sincere, I thought Rayzer was just being ironic, making a joke about

acts in another message.  He is not supporting the banning, Juan.

"Oh, thank you, Mr. Boyce.  Please, go to Hell with all my cumpliments and

You use a lot the adjective "decent".  Please, your patterns of decency are
_not_ exactly the same adopted in a punk community or even in several
countries around the world.  Mine, for example.
I am not being ironic or agressive.  I am talking too serious with you.
Sorry, asking for moderation here, in this specific list, makes no sense.
It would be really wrong.
I was banned from tor-talk mailing list for defending a victim of brutal
harassment and accusations with no proofs.  This victim is my friend and is
being attacked for a lynch mob.  Is it not decent for you?
I already had seen Jake in several talks before, but he just becomes my
friend when I saw him crying for Aaron Swartz.  I learned to love him after
it.  I was crying next to him and I was a cute, fragile, young girl, but he
prefered to comfort and to hug a fat, tall, not so young man, who was
crying much more than us together.
Jake never knowed, but the tall North-American guy that, years ago, he
hugged in a so sweet way is one of the persons that I more respect in the
whole world.  I could die for this guy now if he needs it, because he has a
huge, amazing heart, one of the kindest souls that I know and he really
believes in a better world and works hard for it.
I think Jake never will remember me, but that was the first time I saw him
as a friend.  Jake was not a "rock star" (ridiculous expression used for
some people), he was just a sad boy crying for a dead friend, for Aaron's
lost dreams...  I've spent a long time just seeing them hugging each other
and, even not being the best of creatures, I sincerely prayed for them,
asking God to bless both and Aaron' soul and his family.
When Jake left my friend, I also hugged him, my huge lovely crying teddy
bear...  Jake saw our hug with some curiosity because he saw me watching
them for a long time.  I was hugging my friend and Jake saw my eyes still
crying.  My head was almost behind my friend's arm, because he is much,
really much taller than me.  Jake was not so close and made me a signal,
asking me if I needed something.  I smiled, so he smiled and finally left
the room.
After it, I already saw Jake crying, blushing, smiling, laughing, missing
more friends, dead and alive...  God, do you really think that would be
decent to let stupid blind people destroy my friend's life?!  If you think
it is decent, sorry, I reject your concept of decency now and will reject
it all the days of my life.
I prefer to be banned of all existent mailing and discussion lists than
supporting something so infamous, so disgusting...
Take care and (re)think about your concepts of decency, please.

Thought this would be of great interest to those of you studying media
geography and online bias.  The Google Trends group created for me a map of
how often Americans have searched about each country in the world thus far
in 2016. Turns out it matches quite closely the attention paid to each
country by American television coverage 2009-2016. Africa, Central Asia and
the Baltics are standouts, along with Southern Europe.  Thought this was
quite fascinating to pair up all of the work being done on media geography
and online bias with the use of search volume as a proxy for American
public interest in those countries.

Most of all know about my love for fun subjects, like Law, comics, music,
open data and Astronomy.
Below, a small excerpt of Neil deGrasse Tyson's last speech in the new
"Cosmos" series.  It is really beautiful and inspiring not only for
researchers, but for everybody who wants to search for truth.
"How did we, tiny creatures living on that speck of dust, ever manage to
figure out how to send spacecraft outer among the stars of the milky way?
Only a few centuries ago, a mere second of the cosmic time.  We knew
nothing of where and when we were.  Oblivious to the rest of the cosmos, we
inhabited a kind of prison, a tiny universe bounded by a nutshell.
How did we escape from the prison?  It was the work of generation of
searchers, who took 5 simple rules to heart.
Question authority.  No idea is true just because someone says so,
including me.  Think for yourself.
Question yourself.  Don't believe anything just because you want to.
Believing something doesn't make it so.
Test ideas, by the evidence gained from observation and experiment.  If a
favorite idea fails a well designed test, it's wrong.  Get over it.
Follow the evidence, were ever it leads.  If you have no evidence, reserve
And perhaps even the most important rule of all, remember you could be
wrong.   Even the best scientist have been wrong about somethings.  Newton,
Einstein, and ever other great scientist in history.  They all made
mistakes.  Of course they did, their were human."

Cryptography pioneer Marty Hellman calls for compassion in personal, cyber,
and international threats
        Hellman no longer does crypto research, though he retains a
        position at Stanford; instead, he has been advocating for
        changes in policy that acknowledge the new, more
        interconnected global community.  "I see cyberweapons as very
        similar to nuclear weapons," he said. "Early on we had a
        monopoly on nuclear weapons so we thought they were the
        greatest thing going. But unlike a nuclear weapon, a
        cyberweapon doesn't destroy itself, so like with Stuxnet, our
        adversaries were able to take it apart and figure out how it
        works. We need to start thinking this through more carefully."

Jacob.  It was obvious since the first message, but some of the reasons
were unexpected for me, at least.  I need to search more information about
it and verify if it is really true before invite her to write a statment or
tell more about it in a trial.
Another tech woman, a brutally sincere friend who I love a lot and consider
one of the most intelligent persons that I know, perceived the lie that I
mentioned before I point it to her.  It simply does not make sense...  :-/

about it and says even worse things about me, hahaha!!  She is really
bitter sometimes, but pretty realistic and I do love extremely sincere
friends, haha!!  ;D
Well, she knows in person Jake, Isis and a lot of people mentioned and
doesn't like anyone.  None of them, I swear.  :P
Told me some stories about egocentrism, injured pride, politics, money,
etc, and asked me to avoid this kind of f*cking harmful crazy people
because I am too stupid to protect myself, haha!!  It makes sense, but now
I am curious about the truth, haha!!  ;D
She asked me to avoid meetings with one of alleged victims at any cost,
because "she is a f*cking sick jealous crazy b*tch", able of killing me and
tell lies about self-defense or psychotical breaks and lapses of memory in
public.  My friend is a bit neurotic, but is a good woman and is just
worried about me, hihi...  ;)
Just in case, the world is really small and I will contact one of the
ex-partners of this alleged victim in special.  I don't know him, but I
would like to know if she likes scandals, lies, breaking objects, this kind
of crazy stupid actions...  She has an ego much bigger than usual and I
know that Jake has the same problem, ugh!  :P

My personal convictions about avoiding moderation at any cost, in a recent

It was a disaster because I knowed him in person and everybody knows I
really liked him a lot.  I wrote several advertising messages before put
him in moderated mode.  I never banned a person and he was the only person

persons list, who always said "love too much", and offended me in several
personal channels, including cell phone and messengers.  I received dozens
of cruel messages telling about my friends' impressions about me.
After his disgusting messages for me, I was completely sure that I was
right choosing to moderate him and his destructive e-mails.  I was
protecting the readers of the list, Juan.  It was a proof of consideration

At least, a trial would be much more interesting and fun than another rape,
yay!!!  :D
I simply asked to Boyce if I could re-subscribe again and told him what is
happening.  I told him I asked about the tor-talk list moderation rules
weeks ago and had no answer about it.  I told him why I think it was really
disgusting and sick to call me a "ludicrous rape apologetics".  I told him
to put me under moderation, but permissing me to learn more about the Tor
Project, reading the list.  I promised to be on topic only.  Answers?  No,
I didn't receive any answer.
I don't know if someone told lies about it, but he didn't answer to my
messages and I gave up.  I said earlier that I won't waste more tears and
time with a loser able of calling a "rape apologetics" a victim of rape.
It was really unfair and cruel and, sorry, only a sick person makes this
kind of thing.
Boyce is the kind of guy able of telling lies to manipulate dumber people.
Ja.group proved it is pretty easy.
I know it can be really hard for you understand it, but some people around
the world really like to avoid guns, lies and moralist hypocrite discourses.
Ja.group members are still subscribed on tor-talk list and, as they did
before, they simply will create another account to post there.  I said I
want to use my real name and this personal account.  It is not hard to
understand it, is it?  :)

Oh, it was pretty obvious.  So sorry, Quinn, I thought it was a neurosis of

how to behave as a member of decent society. Threatening to rejoin a
mailing list one has just been booted from, is not how decent people behave.
My dear, I was waiting for Boyce's answer.  I asked humbly after his
offenses and had no answers, so I gave up.  Sorry, I won't die or be sick
because of it.  I cried yesterday, I admiss, but just because it was really
stupid calling me a "rape apologetics".
Today is a new day and I have several perspectives for my life and my
studies.  I don't need tor-talk list, it is past.  I will never use lies to
subscribe there.  My nature is really easy to understand.  I used my real
name and a public account in all the moments.  I like true colors.
And being sincere, probably I already read much more Law books and holy
books  (not only the Bible)  than you and I think it is really complex to
define how "decent people behave".  I don't have this kind of pretention.

I asked him to apologize me and I was sincere, but I still think that using
a Federal Court to judge a person trying to read a list and not using the
same courts to judge persons who created that site is really bizarre.
Here, the ja.group would be judged for three different crimes against  (a
person's)  honor, at least.  They and the Tor Project would spend a
considerable amount of money paying civil and criminal indenizations.
Being sincere, I really don't know who tried to re-subscribe using another
account or if it was just another lie.  You all know, everybody in the Tor

In private, some people said they didn't try subscribe again.  I swear I
did not, so I don't know if someone really tried to subscribe using threats
or not.

Thank you, my dear, but it is not the same thing.  I want to be formaly

If the people behind ja.group are still subscribed, even after using two
fake accounts to humilliate and harass a person, why can't I be subscribed
too?  :)
Some of the people behind the lynch mob already told their names and they
are still in the tor-talk list.  Only two fake accounts were banned.  The
real accounts are normally subscribed.  Not fair, not reasonable.  It says
a lot about the moderation team's preferences.
If I had told lies using a fake account, my personal account would be still
protected and subscribed.  Instead, I decided to expose myself in an honest
way and I am being punished for not using a fake account to defend Jake.
You know, being sincere and transparent is not a valuable thing for
hypocrite people.

You use a lot the adjective "decent".  Please, your patterns of decency are
_not_ exactly the same adopted in a punk community or even in several
countries around the world.  Mine, for example.
I am not being ironic or agressive.  I am talking too serious with you.
Sorry, asking for moderation here, in this specific list, makes no sense.
It would be really wrong.
I was banned from tor-talk mailing list for defending a victim of brutal
harassment and accusations with no proofs.  This victim is my friend and is
being attacked for a lynch mob.  Is it not decent for you?
I already had seen Jake in several talks before, but he just becomes my
friend when I saw him crying for Aaron Swartz.  I learned to love him after
it.  I was crying next to him and I was a cute, fragile, young girl, but he
prefered to comfort and to hug a fat, tall, not so young man, who was
crying much more than us together.
Jake never knowed, but the tall North-American guy that, years ago, he
hugged in a so sweet way is one of the persons that I more respect in the
whole world.  I could die for this guy now if he needs it, because he has a
huge, amazing heart, one of the kindest souls that I know and he really
believes in a better world and works hard for it.
I think Jake never will remember me, but that was the first time I saw him
as a friend.  Jake was not a "rock star" (ridiculous expression used for
some people), he was just a sad boy crying for a dead friend, for Aaron's
lost dreams...  I've spent a long time just seeing them hugging each other
and, even not being the best of creatures, I sincerely prayed for them,
asking God to bless both and Aaron' soul and his family.
When Jake left my friend, I also hugged him, my huge lovely crying teddy
bear...  Jake saw our hug with some curiosity because he saw me watching
them for a long time.  I was hugging my friend and Jake saw my eyes still
crying.  My head was almost behind my friend's arm, because he is much,
really much taller than me.  Jake was not so close and made me a signal,
asking me if I needed something.  I smiled, so he smiled and finally left
the room.
After it, I already saw Jake crying, blushing, smiling, laughing, missing
more friends, dead and alive...  God, do you really think that would be
decent to let stupid blind people destroy my friend's life?!  If you think
it is decent, sorry, I reject your concept of decency now and will reject
it all the days of my life.
I prefer to be banned of all existent mailing and discussion lists than
supporting something so infamous, so disgusting...
Take care and (re)think about your concepts of decency, please.

Thought this would be of great interest to those of you studying media
geography and online bias.  The Google Trends group created for me a map of
how often Americans have searched about each country in the world thus far
in 2016. Turns out it matches quite closely the attention paid to each
country by American television coverage 2009-2016. Africa, Central Asia and
the Baltics are standouts, along with Southern Europe.  Thought this was
quite fascinating to pair up all of the work being done on media geography
and online bias with the use of search volume as a proxy for American
public interest in those countries.

Below, a small excerpt of Neil deGrasse Tyson's last speech in the new
"Cosmos" series.  It is really beautiful and inspiring not only for
researchers, but for everybody who wants to search for truth.
"How did we, tiny creatures living on that speck of dust, ever manage to
figure out how to send spacecraft outer among the stars of the milky way?
Only a few centuries ago, a mere second of the cosmic time.  We knew
nothing of where and when we were.  Oblivious to the rest of the cosmos, we
inhabited a kind of prison, a tiny universe bounded by a nutshell.
How did we escape from the prison?  It was the work of generation of
searchers, who took 5 simple rules to heart.
Question authority.  No idea is true just because someone says so,
including me.  Think for yourself.
Question yourself.  Don't believe anything just because you want to.
Believing something doesn't make it so.
Test ideas, by the evidence gained from observation and experiment.  If a

Follow the evidence, were ever it leads.  If you have no evidence, reserve
And perhaps even the most important rule of all, remember you could be
wrong.   Even the best scientist have been wrong about somethings.  Newton,

Cryptography pioneer Marty Hellman calls for compassion in personal, cyber,
and international threats
        Hellman no longer does crypto research, though he retains a
        position at Stanford; instead, he has been advocating for
        changes in policy that acknowledge the new, more
        interconnected global community.  "I see cyberweapons as very
        similar to nuclear weapons," he said. "Early on we had a
        monopoly on nuclear weapons so we thought they were the
        greatest thing going. But unlike a nuclear weapon, a
        cyberweapon doesn't destroy itself, so like with Stuxnet, our
        adversaries were able to take it apart and figure out how it
        works. We need to start thinking this through more carefully."

Meh, too childish...  It's becoming pretty boring!  :-/
Maybe a man can't see it, but even the most stupid woman in the world can
notice an evident *lie* in the last statment published.
The obvious efforts trying to adjust the accusations to being more
realistic and plausible, giving also more colours and emotions, are pretty
interesting.  I like it!  ;)
I didn't stop to search for some trustworthy information and for more
references in last days.
A programmer (woman) told me some 'juicy gossip' about one of alleged
victims, but it would be pretty disgusting to tell it here.  Ugh!  :-/
Well, in thesis, one of alleged victims is being hypocrite and hates
Jacob.  It was obvious since the first message, but some of the reasons
were unexpected for me, at least.  I need to search more information about
it and verify if it is really true before invite her to write a statment or
tell more about it in a trial.
Another tech woman, a brutally sincere friend who I love a lot and consider
one of the most intelligent persons that I know, perceived the lie that I
mentioned before I point it to her.  It simply does not make sense...  :-/
I always says my friend is a 'feminazi' who hates all the men and she knows
about it and says even worse things about me, hahaha!!  She is really
bitter sometimes, but pretty realistic and I do love extremely sincere
friends, haha!!  ;D
Well, she knows in person Jake, Isis and a lot of people mentioned and
doesn't like anyone.  None of them, I swear.  :P
Told me some stories about egocentrism, injured pride, politics, money,
etc, and asked me to avoid this kind of f*cking harmful crazy people
because I am too stupid to protect myself, haha!!  It makes sense, but now
I am curious about the truth, haha!!  ;D
She asked me to avoid meetings with one of alleged victims at any cost,
because "she is a f*cking sick jealous crazy b*tch", able of killing me and
tell lies about self-defense or psychotical breaks and lapses of memory in
public.  My friend is a bit neurotic, but is a good woman and is just
worried about me, hihi...  ;)
Just in case, the world is really small and I will contact one of the
ex-partners of this alleged victim in special.  I don't know him, but I
would like to know if she likes scandals, lies, breaking objects, this kind
of crazy stupid actions...  She has an ego much bigger than usual and I
know that Jake has the same problem, ugh!  :P
Warm hugs and tender kisses!!!  Ah, thank you everybody!!!  I received some
lovely messages about helping homeless people and two donations, yay!!!  ;D

I have no much pride.  I don't care about "begging", if the reasons are
important for me and other persons.
I want to learn more about Tor Project and I want to do it using my real

lists.  I have lots of accounts, but this is the public one, the less
important account.
I hate moderation, but I was and I am moderator in several lists, because I
am considered transparent and everybody can contact me easily, Juan.
My personal convictions about avoiding moderation at any cost, in a recent
past, had a really negative impact in one of the lists that I used to
moderate.  A poisounous guy made a real chaos in the discuss list.
It was a disaster because I knowed him in person and everybody knows I
really liked him a lot.  I wrote several advertising messages before put
him in moderated mode.  I never banned a person and he was the only person
that I put under moderation until now.
After being advertised about the moderation, he left a much more than 2.000
persons list, who always said "love too much", and offended me in several
personal channels, including cell phone and messengers.  I received dozens
of cruel messages telling about my friends' impressions about me.
After his disgusting messages for me, I was completely sure that I was
right choosing to moderate him and his destructive e-mails.  I was
protecting the readers of the list, Juan.  It was a proof of consideration
and respect, not censure.
A moderator can be an injust person and I already was victim of it several
times, but the moderator role in all the lists is protecting them and their
members.  I am a moderator and already was under moderation.  I know both

I simply asked to Boyce if I could re-subscribe again and told him what is

weeks ago and had no answer about it.  I told him why I think it was really
disgusting and sick to call me a "ludicrous rape apologetics".  I told him
to put me under moderation, but permissing me to learn more about the Tor
Project, reading the list.  I promised to be on topic only.  Answers?  No,
I didn't receive any answer.
I don't know if someone told lies about it, but he didn't answer to my
messages and I gave up.  I said earlier that I won't waste more tears and
time with a loser able of calling a "rape apologetics" a victim of rape.
It was really unfair and cruel and, sorry, only a sick person makes this

Boyce is the kind of guy able of telling lies to manipulate dumber people.

I know it can be really hard for you understand it, but some people around

how to behave as a member of decent society. Threatening to rejoin a

And being sincere, probably I already read much more Law books and holy

I asked him to apologize me and I was sincere, but I still think that using
a Federal Court to judge a person trying to read a list and not using the
same courts to judge persons who created that site is really bizarre.
Here, the ja.group would be judged for three different crimes against  (a

considerable amount of money paying civil and criminal indenizations.

Some of the people behind the lynch mob already told their names and they

a lot about the moderation team's preferences.

You use a lot the adjective "decent".  Please, your patterns of decency are
_not_ exactly the same adopted in a punk community or even in several
countries around the world.  Mine, for example.
I am not being ironic or agressive.  I am talking too serious with you.
Sorry, asking for moderation here, in this specific list, makes no sense.
It would be really wrong.
I was banned from tor-talk mailing list for defending a victim of brutal
harassment and accusations with no proofs.  This victim is my friend and is
being attacked for a lynch mob.  Is it not decent for you?
I already had seen Jake in several talks before, but he just becomes my
friend when I saw him crying for Aaron Swartz.  I learned to love him after
it.  I was crying next to him and I was a cute, fragile, young girl, but he
prefered to comfort and to hug a fat, tall, not so young man, who was
crying much more than us together.
Jake never knowed, but the tall North-American guy that, years ago, he
hugged in a so sweet way is one of the persons that I more respect in the
whole world.  I could die for this guy now if he needs it, because he has a
huge, amazing heart, one of the kindest souls that I know and he really
believes in a better world and works hard for it.
I think Jake never will remember me, but that was the first time I saw him
as a friend.  Jake was not a "rock star" (ridiculous expression used for
some people), he was just a sad boy crying for a dead friend, for Aaron's
lost dreams...  I've spent a long time just seeing them hugging each other
and, even not being the best of creatures, I sincerely prayed for them,
asking God to bless both and Aaron' soul and his family.
When Jake left my friend, I also hugged him, my huge lovely crying teddy
bear...  Jake saw our hug with some curiosity because he saw me watching
them for a long time.  I was hugging my friend and Jake saw my eyes still
crying.  My head was almost behind my friend's arm, because he is much,
really much taller than me.  Jake was not so close and made me a signal,
asking me if I needed something.  I smiled, so he smiled and finally left
the room.
After it, I already saw Jake crying, blushing, smiling, laughing, missing
more friends, dead and alive...  God, do you really think that would be
decent to let stupid blind people destroy my friend's life?!  If you think
it is decent, sorry, I reject your concept of decency now and will reject
it all the days of my life.
I prefer to be banned of all existent mailing and discussion lists than
supporting something so infamous, so disgusting...
Take care and (re)think about your concepts of decency, please.

Thought this would be of great interest to those of you studying media
geography and online bias.  The Google Trends group created for me a map of
how often Americans have searched about each country in the world thus far
in 2016. Turns out it matches quite closely the attention paid to each
country by American television coverage 2009-2016. Africa, Central Asia and
the Baltics are standouts, along with Southern Europe.  Thought this was
quite fascinating to pair up all of the work being done on media geography
and online bias with the use of search volume as a proxy for American
public interest in those countries.

Most of all know about my love for fun subjects, like Law, comics, music,
open data and Astronomy.
Below, a small excerpt of Neil deGrasse Tyson's last speech in the new
"Cosmos" series.  It is really beautiful and inspiring not only for
researchers, but for everybody who wants to search for truth.
"How did we, tiny creatures living on that speck of dust, ever manage to
figure out how to send spacecraft outer among the stars of the milky way?
Only a few centuries ago, a mere second of the cosmic time.  We knew
nothing of where and when we were.  Oblivious to the rest of the cosmos, we
inhabited a kind of prison, a tiny universe bounded by a nutshell.
How did we escape from the prison?  It was the work of generation of
searchers, who took 5 simple rules to heart.
Question authority.  No idea is true just because someone says so,
including me.  Think for yourself.
Question yourself.  Don't believe anything just because you want to.
Believing something doesn't make it so.
Test ideas, by the evidence gained from observation and experiment.  If a
favorite idea fails a well designed test, it's wrong.  Get over it.
Follow the evidence, were ever it leads.  If you have no evidence, reserve
And perhaps even the most important rule of all, remember you could be
wrong.   Even the best scientist have been wrong about somethings.  Newton,
Einstein, and ever other great scientist in history.  They all made
mistakes.  Of course they did, their were human."

Cryptography pioneer Marty Hellman calls for compassion in personal, cyber,
and international threats
        Hellman no longer does crypto research, though he retains a
        position at Stanford; instead, he has been advocating for
        changes in policy that acknowledge the new, more
        interconnected global community.  "I see cyberweapons as very
        similar to nuclear weapons," he said. "Early on we had a
        monopoly on nuclear weapons so we thought they were the
        greatest thing going. But unlike a nuclear weapon, a
        cyberweapon doesn't destroy itself, so like with Stuxnet, our
        adversaries were able to take it apart and figure out how it
        works. We need to start thinking this through more carefully."

Oh, unhappily I have no much sanity to be saved...  meh!  :(
But I swear I will read it with care and attention.  I absolutely do love
books!  They make me purr, rom rom...  <3
( 'rom rom' is a Brazilian onomatopoeia for 'purring' and, for me, it
sounds pretty cute when talking about books because 'hon'  - 'book' in
Japanese -  sounds like 'rom', hihi...  So I am happy, purring and asking

It's amazing what can happen when smart people take LSD.
Oh, I really love this book, haha!!  Already read "Principia Discordia"

I didn't learn the world's worst bad word yet, but used to call him

It's a lovely coincidence, Steve.  Today I was seriously considering to
kill one of my stalkers, but it would be pretty hard to hide his body and
killing a person wouldn't be a vegan thing, uff...  :-/
Well, I never tried LSD.  I don't have inclination for drugs, but I know a
lot of different users, including several Apple products addicteds and
hardcore Microsoft users.  I sincerely try to respect and understand all of

One of my craziest friends invited me to travel with him to know an
indigenous tribe and use an hallucinogen made with frogs' poison.  He
already tried it three times, really loved it and swears it will heal my
broken heart.  So I told him the cheekiest lie of my life to avoid hurting
his feelings...  "Oh, Dani, poison extracted from frogs?  Sorry, it is not
vegan!"  :P  :P  :P
( I am not vegan anymore, just veggie, but he doesn't need to know it or
will invite me to taste one of his hallucinogen teas, uh!  Luckly, he
thinks vegans are a kind of 'radical veggie nazis', who don't taste
anything without "free animal cruelty" labels.  It is not true, but it is
pretty convenient for me!  "Sorry, Dani, your hemp is a plant, but it has
no labels.  Is it organic?" Hahaha!! )

fucking cesspool, aided and abetted by you and your comrades.
Few days ago, I felt really bad, horrible when received a private message
of a sweet woman, telling me how much she would like to answer to some
messages, to interact and to share informations and her opinion about
interesting subjects, but she feels so afraid of being attacked, of
disgusting aggressive answers, of being harassed that she always prefers to
keep the silence.  :(
** We are losing good informations, technical and personal opinions of good
people, good professionals, because this list is _not_ healthy, is too
aggressive. **
I really do not care so much about what happened/is happening to me, but it
scared a lot of more sensitive persons here.  The cyberbullying was/is
being more violent and repetitive, with rape menaces, subscriptions in
disgusting dating sites, stupid spam messages, etc, etc, *because I am a
woman*.  It was very evident and disgusting, very coward.
I was described as _lesbian_ hot Japanese slut in one of the dating sites,
and _bisexual_ hot Latin woman in another one.  Hey, wasn't I a pervert,
almost killing myself because of _male_ musky laps few days ago?  Haha!!  I
really love musky smells, but not enough to kill me for them, haha!!  ;)
Also received  (and I am still receiving)  hundreds of spam messages asking
me to subscribe in 'dating sites'.  Some of them were involuntarily funny
like "Latin Women Searching For American Husbands" or "Senior Dating", what
explains all the "geriatric diapers" spam received.  ;)
It's annoying, disgusting, gross.  The intention was to humiliate and to
hurt me.  It is _not_ healthy to see so much hate, but it is _not_ mine.
Obviously only sick bad people do this kind of thing.  Aff...  :P
A wise friend always say, "The path to inner peace begins with just four
words: "Not my f*¢king problem!", and he is correct.  So much pathological
hate needs psychiatric and psychological support.  Getting a life would be
good too!  ;)
Sincerely?  It is being stressing and I already lost important time
managing everything, but I am strong enough to survive very well and kick
some asses very hard.  ** What really annoys me is knowing that some
sensitive persons here never will write anything on this list because of
this oppressive dictatorship of fear and bad words. **
I use bad words because they are very 'expressive', but they are really
aggressive to a great part of people and it isn't a good thing, is
disrespectful.  Unhappily, some people here don't understand "please ...",
but understand very well "please &%  Troll dialet, sorry.  :(
We can do this mailing list more _useful_ and _sane_ to everybody, _less
harmful_ to some people.  We should try it, at least.
Obs:  -  Lots of late private answers.  Sorry, had a little accident and I
am having some personal problems.  And bizarre problems in another list,
ugh!  :P
Do you believe we were discussing Yahoo, NSA, privacy, moral damages, etc,
in a Brazilian _technical_ private group of studies of Law and Technology,
and a friend of mine decided to discuss NSA, USA elections and _the return
of Jesus Christ_ too?  :-/
God, I do love this guy, he was already an activist and professor before my
birth, but discussing Jesus Christ, Satan, USA elections, etc, in a
technical, specifically focused group, where all the members collaborate to
make more efficient the Brazilian judicial procedures using technology,
made me think about this list and really panicked me.  Ugh, fear!  :-/

Ah, read my message AGAIN too, please.  "All the hate for Trump" _AND ALL

You're pretty fair, baby.  Jihadists cannot do these bad things, but Trump
can because he's a proud North American citizen.  So, your President can
attack women and being intolerant with all the people.  OK, it is not much

You aren't hypocrite, at least.

Sorry, but if Trump is the answer, it must be a pretty stupid question.  :-/
The jokes are being great  (
  but I am pretty
worried and think exactly what Keith Hart commented on  list:
"Yet, the world and especially the US will become a much more dangerous
place. I can't bear to think what kind of world my 14-year-old daughter
will become an adult in. To be Black, Latino, Muslim or even a woman in
America will be a lot worse -- the first signs of this came within hours of
Trump being elected."
I am just mentioning the email instead forward it, because the thread
("What is the meaning of Trump's victory?")  and respective messages are
being very interesting and long.  This message touched me a lot because he
is worried about his daughter's future, but Keith Sanborn's message
effectively made me cry because I know in a very intimate way this kind of
fear.  This kind of fear teached me how to use blades and chemicals much
better.  Violence always attracts violence and Trump was very brutal in his
"One of my female students had this experience, the day after Trump was
elected. She was walking down the street around 14th street, on the West
side in New York. A man approached her and said: “Now I can grab your pussy
any time I want.” She is afraid to go outside. This isn’t the friend, or
the friend of a friend, or an ubran myth, but from the mouth of the person
who experienced it first hand."

Hope a revolution happens in USA, but with no violence, no deaths, no civil
war.  Now, yes, I think it's very adequate to wish God bless and protect
USA's people.
OK, I admit I don't know if God(s) exist(s) or not, but wish good things is
always good.  Good vibes, good energy.  About Jesus, I don't know if he is
just a legend like Saint George, but he teached me a lot.  He inspired me
to pretend being dead for some days to get a break after stressing and
traumatic facts, hihi...  ;)

I really don't support coward acts.  The 'JA group' made it before, do you
remember?  They created _fake accounts_ in different groups using _Jake's

I usually criticize persons using my own name, giving them the right of

fucking cesspool, aided and abetted by you and your comrades.
Few days ago, I felt really bad, horrible when received a private message
of a sweet woman, telling me how much she would like to answer to some
messages, to interact and to share informations and her opinion about
interesting subjects, but she feels so afraid of being attacked, of
disgusting aggressive answers, of being harassed that she always prefers to
keep the silence.  :(
** We are losing good informations, technical and personal opinions of good
people, good professionals, because this list is _not_ healthy, is too
aggressive. **
I really do not care so much about what happened/is happening to me, but it
scared a lot of more sensitive persons here.  The cyberbullying was/is
being more violent and repetitive, with rape menaces, subscriptions in
disgusting dating sites, stupid spam messages, etc, etc, *because I am a
woman*.  It was very evident and disgusting, very coward.
I was described as _lesbian_ hot Japanese slut in one of the dating sites,
and _bisexual_ hot Latin woman in another one.  Hey, wasn't I a pervert,
almost killing myself because of _male_ musky laps few days ago?  Haha!!  I
really love musky smells, but not enough to kill me for them, haha!!  ;)
Also received  (and I am still receiving)  hundreds of spam messages asking
me to subscribe in 'dating sites'.  Some of them were involuntarily funny
like "Latin Women Searching For American Husbands" or "Senior Dating", what
explains all the "geriatric diapers" spam received.  ;)
It's annoying, disgusting, gross.  The intention was to humiliate and to
hurt me.  It is _not_ healthy to see so much hate, but it is _not_ mine.
Obviously only sick bad people do this kind of thing.  Aff...  :P
A wise friend always say, "The path to inner peace begins with just four
words: "Not my f*¢king problem!", and he is correct.  So much pathological
hate needs psychiatric and psychological support.  Getting a life would be
good too!  ;)
Sincerely?  It is being stressing and I already lost important time
managing everything, but I am strong enough to survive very well and kick
some asses very hard.  ** What really annoys me is knowing that some
sensitive persons here never will write anything on this list because of
this oppressive dictatorship of fear and bad words. **
I use bad words because they are very 'expressive', but they are really
aggressive to a great part of people and it isn't a good thing, is
disrespectful.  Unhappily, some people here don't understand "please ...",
but understand very well "please &%  Troll dialet, sorry.  :(

will become an adult in. To be Black, Latino, Muslim or even a woman in
America will be a lot worse -- the first signs of this came within hours of
Trump being elected."
I am just mentioning the email instead forward it, because the thread
("What is the meaning of Trump's victory?")  and respective messages are
being very interesting and long.  This message touched me a lot because he
is worried about his daughter's future, but Keith Sanborn's message
effectively made me cry because I know in a very intimate way this kind of
fear.  This kind of fear teached me how to use blades and chemicals much
better.  Violence always attracts violence and Trump was very brutal in his
"One of my female students had this experience, the day after Trump was
elected. She was walking down the street around 14th street, on the West
side in New York. A man approached her and said: “Now I can grab your pussy
any time I want.” She is afraid to go outside. This isn’t the friend, or
the friend of a friend, or an ubran myth, but from the mouth of the person
who experienced it first hand."

Hope a revolution happens in USA, but with no violence, no deaths, no civil

They are _not_ mine, Razer.  I don't care about your opinion anymore, but I
swear they are not mine in any sense.
otra via, off yourself.
Razer, are you really asking to a person to suicide?  Are you able to
notice how cruel, how vile is asking to a person take their own life?  :(
You are so bitter, Razer.  Sorry if I broke your heart or hurt you.  I
never knowed you liked me so much, I swear.
And, sorry, asking me to suicide is the best way to keep myself alive.  I
never respect unfair authorities and pretentious people.  I'll take my own
decisions about my life and my death, not you or another person.
You do need some love.  Try to move to one of these Japanese islands.  Cats

Gays couples used to live with fear in Russia and Putin's homophobic
politicies make being gay there almost a crime, with no serious
investigations about their homicides and agressions, everything happens
with the State convenience.
It's enough for making me consider this situation unfair, illogical.  That

political theory though.
Definition of neurotic:  I will learn something more useful for me than hating the USA, Juan.  I am
finishing the reading of an interesting book named "Speaking Code: Coding
as Aesthetic and Political Expression" and I am thinking about new
eletronics projects for making children laughing in the Halloween.
Candies, electronics and happy kids make me feel blessed for still being
alive.  Politics and corrupt and hypocrite politicians make me strongly
wish the suicide again.  Do you understand the difference?  :)
I am tired of pompous people auto-denominating themselves "activists",
speaking and writing millions of empty words, without saying something
really relevant, like Zenaan, for example, always does.  I want to code and
to create new ideas, to make new things.  I want to learn and I always said
it since the beggining.
I am still reading all the suggested bibliography about Anarchism and I am
really grateful for all the wonderful references, but I am making _my own
interpretations_ of all the texts.  I am my own cat and all the places are
mine, do you remember?  I make my own choices, wrong or not.
I always read several books and texts at same time and, it definitely isn't
practical, but makes me happy.  It's fun to think about cute pink unicorns
and how to destroy governments at same time.
I prefer learn how to coding well than the ABC of political theory, if it
will make me a neurotic, who will see USA, military forces or fanatic
religions in every disaster that happens in the world.  Did Hurricane
Matthew destroy Haiti because of USA military too?  Was it lack of faith?

for spam by using the spammer's handle and my handle FOR NO GOOD REASON in
the same emails ... I'm gonna start subscribing you to every White
Supremacist newsletter I can find. Then I'll start working on the
Misogynist Sites. Then... Nambla. Maybe you like little boys eh?
Scientists say the Universe is made up with neutrons, protons and
electrons.  They obviously forgot to mention morons too.  :P
Ok, I am a moron.  Now, my dear, why so much hate in this little heart
today?  :)
First of all, sorry, but it's obvious that the mentioned choices  - "White
Supremacist lists", "Misogynist sites" and "Nambla" -  have much more your
profile than mine...  :P
1)  I am _not_ a Caucasian male like you.  The White Supremacists don't
like "yellow people", poor "Japs" girls who live in the Third World like
me.  Snif, snif...  I feel so rejected for the nazi bad guys...  :'(
2)  You have problems to accept the GLBTQ rights, not me.  I accept and
support all of them.  You can confirm it with all the rainbows in the sky,
la la la!  :)
3)  And about little boys and little girls, yes, you are right, my dear.  I
love them very much.  I used to be a baby sitter when were a very young
student and, well, I always wanted to be a mother, but I had no much luck
and just became a cute auntie for my friend's kids.  Not an "imperial
auntie" like you.  Just the single girl who buys candies, toys, tells bed
time stories with happy endings and sings old lullabies...
But if you really want to act like an angry teenager, no problem, I can do
exactly the same and better than you, dear.  You do know it.  My English is
a disaster, but I am fluent in Moron, Troll, Cecilian and several strange
dialets.  :)
I certainly have less free time in my hands than you, but I don't like
unfair public threats, Razer.  Less drama, please.  Grown up and act like
an adult man.  Or, at least, eat chocolate or take a probiotic yogurt.  Bad
mood is boring!  :(
It was just to ask me to avoid mention your sacrated name in vain.  More
easy, less unpleasent for everybody...  Aff, men are always more dramatic
than women...  So much useless noise, bah...  :(
Well, I love you.  If you annoy me again, I will say your name three
times.  It works with Beetlejuice and Bloody Mary.  If I do it, you will be
in the Banana Republic and I bet you don't dance samba!  :D

please just relax and forget all this discussion.  Too much ado about

I really don't care about this kind of childish menace.  I don't respect
coward people and I don't have patience with brats, too pampered kids.
Razer thinks that his shit stinks less than mine, what is very usual in
North-American ego trips.  It isn't true.  It's excrement the same way.
Fifty bucks is "cheap" for him, a white, male, North-American.  For a
Brazilian woman is not a so low value and I prefer to donate my money to
good institutions, that I really respect and trust.  'Nambla' is his
choice, not mine.
I always loved Razer very much, but the next time I try the suicide, I will
climb his ego and jump, aff...  It will certainly be more fatal than jump
off the Golden Gate Bridge!  (+-+)*
Please, Razer, try to rest a bit, eat something and keep hydrated.
Consider sex/masturbation, chocolate and probiotic yogurt.  Your mood is
really bad today, aff...  :-/
Kisses and hugs, my dear.  I love you very much *when you are not kicking
me*.  Instead donate cash to Nambla, kick them, not me.  They are the bad

My dear Razer,
Being sincere, after your hysteric attack  (aka "direct threat"),  all the
trolls and haters of the cypherpunks list love us both.  And rooty is not a
bot, it's just a creepy, retard teenager, provoking some persons for the
lulz.  Search better, hard headed.
I already received some strange messages as courtesy of your lovely public
suggestions.  If you won't subscribe me on bizarre mailings, someone will
do it pretending to be you.  Should I thank you, my dear?
Congratulations, you humiliated me in public and fucked my e-mail
address...  Are you happy now?  Did you have orgasms knowing I would cry
and feel broken hearted, betrayed, exposed?
You got all the attentions today like an amazing rock star and exposed me
and the private messages sent by Mirimir.  You showed your true colors.
You are not a trustful person and I am disappointed.
I always admired you a lot, but now I will never trust in you again.  I

---------- Forwarded message ----------
Well, your concept of "hysterical" is certainly different from mine, my
dear Razer.  Maybe a cultural difference.  :-/
Hysterical, for me, means "marked by uncontrollable, extreme emotion" and
when a person makes a public direct threat, I suppose this person is _not_
being calm and acting in a rational way.  Here, in Brazil, it's considered
hysterical, crazy, dramatical.  Do you understand my point of view?  :-/
I believe in you, Razer, but *you* gave the awesome idea in a public list,
mentioning my name and giving those lovely sites and lists as examples.
Should I thank you for it, my dear?
INTERESTED IN YOU DOING FOR ME TOO.

Razer, you are a very intelligent man.  You know it and I always admired
your intelligence, your direct way of speaking about your own believes,
your sincerity.
So why the fuck you simply didn't ask me in private to avoid mention your
name in my messages, explaining the reasons, instead making a creepy and
dramatic public threat?
The passional Nipo-Latin here is me, not you!  My Jew boyfriend was very
sweet, but extremely rational.  Guy, you studied a lot for being fair and
rational!  Let the passion thing for me, a Latin girl, please!  :P
Man, that message was insane!  I was in doubt if you were joking with me or
really threating me in public.  Please, be very *clear* in the next
messages and avoid these bizarre misunderstandings!
You always had the most complete freedom to say me everything you wanted in
private or in public.  You could simply say something like "Fuck you,
Ceci!  Stop talking to trolls!"  or  "Never say Razer in vain, because all
the holy books (or whatever) say it's forbidden, a mortal sin!"...

because you did want it.  So, please, let me in peace.  I need a time for

@_subject: Fwd: <nettime> #jakegate explained ... by a Dummy 
NB Two days ago, The Guardian newspaper published a long article
about Jacob Appelbaum, the first text in mainstream media since
the two pieces in Die Zeit Online (see refs below), and only the
second publication I am aware of since the storm around 'Jake' abated
somewhere in last Summer.
This post was largely written in Romania a few weeks ago, and hence
is not informed by the article in The Guardian. It also looks at the
whole affair from a different angle, less focused on the person(age)
 explained by ... a Dummy
Well, since there are so many texts written for dummies, I thought
it would be nice to have one ... written by one. And as you see, I
carefully choose my subject ...
The story going by the moniker  is, I assume largely known
by nettime readers, but here's for an ultra-short ExecSum all the
same: Jacob Appelbaum, aka ‘Jake’ is a prominent hacker-activist
whose precipitous fall from grace and reputation has stunned the
digerati scene. End May/begin of June this year (2016), organisations
at the forefront of the battles for privacy and security like the TOR
project, the CCC, Debian, and others, quite brutally scuttled him
amidst accusation of (longstanding) sexual and social misbehaviour.
But by now a backlash has also occurred as the same organisations
stand accused of precipitate, non-transparent, and largely unfounded
decision making - all this with 'Jake' himself largely disappearing
from view.
My reason for writing this piece is to try to understand - even if
largely for my own sake – the circumstances and group processes
that have been at work in creating this rather startling, though
not totally unanticipated fracas. As a general disclaimer, I should
reiterate that I am truly a dummy in this, in the sense that I am not
an insider, even if I know a few ones. And all I do know stems from
publicly available sources, of course supplemented by a few private
talks – but don’t expect confidential information to be disclosed,
since there was actually none. I do know Jake personally however,
since 2003, and I have followed his activities ever since, be it
from quite a distance. Also 'Jake' knows who I am and has always be
very friendly to me, but we have always been distant acquaintances
nonetheless. In short, my locus standi is situated at the 'core
periphery' to the circles and activities Jake was or is related with -
to use a swanky term Geert Lovink and I once made up.
It may be needless to add and emphasize that ‘ is a very
‘complicated’ issue (as in Facebook), and that I tried to write
about it, following Tacitus, ‘sine ira et studio’ ...
I have structured this text in four sections (plus a concluding
part): Jake’s persona(ge); his social circle, mostly in Berlin; the
organisations he is (was) part of; and the the wider, bad world of
surveillance and repression this constituency is facing and combating.
These sections cannot, however, be strictly separated, they flow and
must weave readily together towards the concluding remarks on the
 backlash and beyond.
On Jake’s persona(ge)
It is self evident that Jake's character, as it appears to his social
environment’s bystanders and to observers at large, provides a
substantial, if by way insufficient, explanation of ‘
Even with some allowances, Jacob Appelbaum might be taken as
exemplary for the phenomenon of a gifted, extrovert geek rising to
prominence, not to say ‘rock star’ status, amidst the general
hacker alternative, and mainstream, media hype. The by now fairly well
documented mix of autism (-lite), mental (over)activity, sociopathy
(-lite), maybe best captured by the German word ‘Drang’ - the
‘urge’ to do ‘something’ - can all be observed, and then in no
small measure, with Jacob Appelbaum. Add precociousness and young age,
and you have the potent combination which might largely – but again,
not entirely – explain how 'Jake' ended up in the predicament that
is now his.
On Jake’s social environment and the groups he is/was in - in
Berlin, mostly.
Another tentative, partial explanation may be found in the nature
and ongoings within the social circles 'Jake' has been moving in the
past years in Berlin, that ‘poor but sexy’ capital which had
overtaken Amsterdam as the place to be if you are young, worldly,
engaged - and poor and sexy. From the early 2000's the city had
become an international magnet to all sorts of creative people and
voluntary organisations, eager to contribute to the “an other world
is possible” idea. Berlin has obvious ‘locational’ advantages
in terms of situation in the geographical and political centre of
Europe and because of its convenience in terms of affordable housing,
cheap food, and a dynamic cultural life (with a frothy night scene to
boot). But it is also the political climate and constitutional set-up
of Germany that had made Berlin a place of choice for ‘technological
refugees’, mostly from the USA, and thanks to its thriving IT scene,
also a hotbed of digital political activism.
Yet at the same time it should be noted that these circles are not
that large - in the low hundreds in terms of number of members –
and that they are more close-knit and culturally, demographically,
and socially homogeneous than is normally the case in the larger
society. In short, young (20/30-ish), single, english speaking, sort
of full time artists/activists in one way or another. Add to this
the pressure of operating against, and hence enduring the special
attention cum repression from the Surveillance Empire, which makes it
easy to imagine a situation where one is living permanently at the
edge, with all its accompanying features like red eye nights, sexual
promiscuity, alcohol and substance (ab)use, and what have you. A
perfect setting for a scenario whose script can easily veer into all
kinds of, err, ‘configurations’ ...
On the organisations Jake works or has worked for
Following on the factual demise of parliamentary political parties,
trade unions, and of the ‘quality’ press as avenues of criticism
and influencing the governance process, the 'NGO-isation of advocacy
and of politics at large has led to the rise of a large number of
voluntary initiatives, whose common characteristics - for the majority
of them - appears to be small in size, and to be run by far too few
underpaid (or not paid at all) people chasing far too many issues at
the same time. This often results in near-mandatory commitment to a
24/7 work schedule, with its concomitant risks of stress, burnout,
wayward behaviour, etc. This is especially the case with those
outfits focusing on the variegated and nefarious manifestations of
the 'deep state' (see below), and then more particularly in the realm
of surveillance and repression. It is clear that such organisations
and their personnel are themselves 'targets', not to say fair game,
for the aforementioned deep state's agencies and services, and this
equally on a 24/7 footing. Another aspect is that such outfits,
despite their small size, 'enjoy' an inordinately large, and usually
sensationalist media coverage every time they manage to uncover yet
another 'scandal', enhancing at the same time their popularity among
some sections of the public (academics, activists, 'progressive'
people). This all makes for a very heady atmosphere, difficult both to
avoid and to resist. And this has been Jake's 'natural biotope' for
quite a number of years past.
Their good work in exposing states' misbehaviour, and even crimes
notwithstanding, such organisations have their dark sides also. Their
small size results in a very limited number of people, or even a
single person (as in a SPO, Single Person Organisation) acting without
very much of an oversight, if at all. To this. organisations involved
in the more 'sensitive' aspects of politics add an extra, justifiable
but nonetheless secretive, opaque layer to their activities. Which
in turn often leads to a permanent state of paranoia, a tunnel
vision due to over-focussing on the outfit's specific issues (at
the expense of looking at the world at large - or at life itself),
and generally a form of dogmatism in both their internal and their
external functioning. It had also as reverse a clear tendency to
delusion of grandeur, exaggerating the importance and the impact of
both the group(s) and the issues at stake among the general public.
And then, also the effects of cut-throat competition in the permanent
hunt for funding and attention among such outfits should not be
overlooked. Finally, both their rhetorics as they working practices
are essentially not that far removed from the modus operandi of
commercial (IT) start-ups, with whom they appear to share (almost)
the same recruitment demographics: young, bright, dynamic, hip - and
The unhappy conclusion is that such organisations are always at risk,
in the end, to veer towards becoming ineffective at best, and morally
bankrupt at worst. Looking, for instance, at the recent management and
political decision-making processes at the TOR foundation triggered by
' don't make one overly optimistic.
On the wider (and bad) world of big government, big corporation, and
their oppressive practices of surveillance and control.
First, I think we need to realize that, in society at large, the
number of people truly concerned, and actively engaging, with the
above issue is incredibly tiny (and shockingly so, even if it is
slowly growing). To most citizens, this is a 'far-from-my-bed-show',
and one they feel utterly powerless about at the same time. Activists
and their organisations sometimes achieve a big media breakthrough and
subsequent, but ephemeral, hype (Wikileaks, Snowden), but most of the
time, awareness, concern, and hence political consequences remain at
a low level, which might in part explain why measures progressively
regulating and restraining citizen's rights and liberties end up so
smoothly in the statute books.
But near-zero awareness is surely not what can be ascribed to the
corporate intelligence contractors banding together with secretive
government agencies, a complex best represented by the concept
of 'deep state'(*). While the former 'partners' are primarily
concerned with protecting and extending their business interests
- which includes supporting, or at least not opposing, the most
outlandish repressive measures by the state agencies when it suits
them, the latter, on the other hand, will go in the end for outright
elimination, physical if necessary, of their opponents and critics, be
it individual or groups. These are the forces groups and organisations
'Jake' works(/ed) for are confronting - making them clear targets.
How precisely and to what extent is difficult to ascertain - beyond
at points of obvious contact, in the form of protracted harassment at
border crossings for instance. This gives rise to speculations fast
drifting into conspiracy theories - something that is not entirely to
the displeasure of aforementioned agencies. I neither wish nor can say
very much more about this, save than to presume that the situation is
both pretty much calamitous and also not amenable to any (re)solution.
Resistance may be the answer to what has probably become the essential
constitutional issue of our times, but I am afraid not to see a
positive outcome evolving unless it mutates into a real law and order
problem for the powers that be. And this is in my view exactly the
point where the above mentioned organisations and their associates,
supporters, and techie-activists fail to enact the effective mix of
political strategy, street-level tactics, and technological fixes,
usually by prioritizing the last option at the expense of the two
In conclusion
As could be read, I have not at all addressed the question of Jacob
Appelbaum's (very?) possible culpability in the matter of sexual
harassment and uncivil/a-social behaviour - the mainstay of the
 brouhaha. This is on purpose, since all evidence, as evinced
in various interventions by equally various parties, point, to use
Facebook's inimitable phrase, towards a 'it's complicated' verdict.
Nonetheless, what I think is more important at this stage, also in
view of the above mentioned evidence, or alleged lack thereof, is the
conclusions the groups and organisations involved, as well as 'Jake'
himself will draw for the future, and how his personal situation
will evolve as a consequence. Now that he has been expelled from
pretty much all the outfits he was associated with (Wikilekas appear
to be an exception, for reasons that may - or may not - be easily
guessed) the question is one of what 'Jake' is going to do next.
For better or for worse, what has happened is beyond recall. With
his 'rockstar' status clearly revoked - a good thing - I believe
it is important for 'Jake' to start afresh and find sustainable
footing in a much more modest and withdrawn role, something that is
also the responsibility of his (former) 'Umfeld to make possible,
or at the very least not to try to thwart it in a senseless pursuit
of revenge. I am thinking of his pursuance of a Phd at Eindhoven
Technical University, something that could constitute a perfect
opportunity for retreat and 'reconfiguration'.
To people who feel they have been to have been aggrieved by 'Jake'
one way or another, and they might have good reasons to feel so,
I would suggest that some 'truth and atonement' get together be
organised, say in one year from now. In the end, whatever the way one
wishes to describe those concerned by or involved in ' in
terms of a community (and that might also include some people in the
nettime readership), then that 'we' must strive, immo, to overcome the
conflict by learning its lessons ("no more rockstars" would be a good
starter), and not repeat the same mistakes, neither at the individual,
nor at the collective level.

nonsense. Your words make no sense at all.
* * *  I received more agressive messages, but I am copying the CypherPunks
list only in this specific answer to advertise the members that there is a
_fake profile_ using my real name.  * * *
Dear 'Fake Profile', aka 'Alex',
Please, consider seriously to study English better and learn the
differences between the words "thread" and "threat".
What you are doing with me in this moment is a "threat", a menace using my
own name and a fake account.  I don't create "threats", my dear.  I receive
them, like now.  :)
Please, consider to use a good English dictionary, Alexander.  The word
"threat" can be used as a substantive or a principal verb.  It doesn't need
the use of the verb "to create".
"Useless nonsense" is creating a fake account just to write a message using
an English worst than mine.  Tsk, tsk...  What a shame, bad boy!
I admiss I am too lazy to use the dictionary in all the moments, but if you
want to use my name in a fake profile, please, be less repetitive and use a
better grammar.  I am annoying, but not so stupid like you.
I will stop posting _only_ if I want it.  Why would be acceptable for you
to be an idiot and posting here and not for me?  It's very unfair, dear.
Hey, Razer told you about the message that I sent him yesterday, asking
peace, begging to stop with this kind of garbage on the list?  He respected
our deal.  Please, be rational and stop the bullying too.
Grown up and get a life, Alex.  A real one, not a profile at 'Second Life'
game or my fake profile, ok?  Believe me, I am more beautiful and charming
than you.  And you're a bit older and hairy too, hoho...  :)

I am not Muslim, but I live next to a Mosque and already studied and worked
with Muslims.  All I had seem in all these years is respect, honor and
tolerance.  I respect them very much.
I am very proud of living in the center of my city, next to Catholic
Churches, Budhist Temples, Spiritualist Houses, Mosques, Synagogues and
several other religious places.  It is very beautiful to see the faith, the
eternal human search for answers.
Sorry for my bad comportament in the list.  I am not so vain or cruel.  I
received some disgusting messages and was provoking my haters, but the
manicure story was true, hihi!  :)
One of my voluntary works with female transgenders is teaching them how to
use make up, making their own manicure, feel secure using high wheels...
It seems futile for most of the people, but they are very fragile, still
working their self esteem, learning how to show to the world their gender,
to express themselves.  I cried a lot when I see one of them feeling more
beautiful, more feminine, absolutely amazing just because of a baby pink
lipstick.  :)
Sometimes, I receive some beauty products  (make up, nail polishes,
shampoos, creams, etc)  to test new brands and write reviews to beauty
sites and blogs.  I was very good at it, but I always am only a ghost
writer and a ghost model for hands and feet, haha!!  ;)
I use most of the products with "my girls" or donate some little kits to
asylums.  Older women like to feel more "colored", more beautiful too.  I
like the idea of working with their self esteem, to remember them how
beautiful they are, how beautiful and colored the world is.  They are
living flowers.  It's a simple thing, but they feel more motived to walking
and making exercises, to fight against their depression and eventual health
problems.  :)
Now, after healing of this new worst pneumonia and discover what's
happening in my work  (money troubles, money troubles everywhere!),  I want
to make some work with the refugees living in my city, teaching a bit more
of Portuguese to the children.
The kids are so smart, so amazing!  They learn everything so fast and just
want to be happy, to study, to hug the other children.  They saw what means
a war, so they love the peace, they love to play...  All the meals for them
are great, even the simplest ones, because they were starving when arrived
here...  :(
One of my friends is a Japanese girl, some years older than me.  When she
arrived in my country, she had the same problems that my parents had.  She
only knowed the Japanese language.  One day, in the school, with 5 years
old, she needed to go to the bathroom and didn't know how to say it in
She made her necessities in the class, crying, feeling humiliated,
listening to the laugh of the other students, because her teacher screamed
several times with her, asking to return to the chair and she didn't
understood anything.
I don't want these poor children suffer the same bullying that my parents,
their friends and my friend suffered.  My French is old garbage, I don't
speak Crioulo, but well, I can learn their languages and they can learn
Portuguese...  And after, with more time and $resource$, programming
languages too!  :)
I promise I will treat myself better, my dear Cari.  Thank you.  Please,
take care of yourself with tenderness too!  :*
Kisses and hugs from Brazil!  <3

Sorry for the bad joke/confession, but in the beginning, I thought it was

my former girlfriends job was working with disabled children. She regularly
worked with girls in their teens who couldn't even speak, not a single
word. They were SEVERELY cognitively impaired. Their diagnosis was autism,
nothing more.
I won't have patience now for searching the correct thread on the cpunks
list, but Juan had a long and very, very exhaustive discussion about
autistic children with Xorcist few weeks ago.
Xorcist has an autistic niece, who loves a lot and considers like a
daughter, and makes voluntary work with disabled children too.  He told
some stories about his convivence with her, his attempts of stimulate her
senses, her intelligence, and about her difficulties to understand the
world and the people.  It was beautiful because he was talking about love.
True love.
I usually try to use music as stimulus for all ages, in all situations.
Music is life, and all the words have sounds, and these sounds are music
I think Xorcist would like to exchange some ideas with your girlfriend
about what he can do for his loved niece and all the other kids that he is
helping.  He has a tender heart and is a very old cpunk.
I will tell you a secret: - when Juan is not being annoying and aggressive,
he is a very dear person, but extremely hard headed.  He has a head so, so
hard that I can break coconuts using it and he won't change his ideas.  :P
He certainly would help me to make voluntary work with disabled children
just to prove me how much I am very, very wrong, hihi!  In some moments, I
want to kick his balls, but I like him!  :)

Faith in people, faith in science, faith in technology, my dear Juan.
Always hoping the people can create better technologies, more precise

more human, fairer, with less pain and crying.  A world without the human
misery:  wars, hunger, diseases, lack of potable water, etc...
control the biggest number of people in the most 'efficient' way.
People don't need any technology to kill each other and manipulate, control
innocent lives using menaces, fear, cruelty...  :(
'friends' at google and the rest of 'captains' of 'industry'.
So change this, make something to fight against the death of the privacy,
instead complaining about Google using a gmail account, my dear.
the importance of technical knowledge to help the people.
I can use my knifes to cook or to kill.  My choice, my responsability,
dear.  You can use the same instruments and ideas in different ways.
Why do you think my thoughts are 'propaganda' and not yours, my dear?
Why is it not true, dear?  It's my opinion, but there are several different
opinions in the world about the same facts.
Points of view are very subjective, influenced by personal backgrounds and
beliefs.  I can't say with absolute and complete certain that my opinion is
the only real truth.  Tolerance and respect, my dear.

Hey, it's good!  Thanks, Alex!  I love when people calls me "Tanaka"!  It's
my surname and I absolutely love it.  My family's legacy for me, my
heritage, my origins, my blood.  In Japanese, we always say the blood is
stronger (denser) than the water.  <3
Your friend Zen saw "artistic beauty" when a nuclear bomb killed great part
of Tanaka family, who still lived in Hiroshima.  Part of my family heritage
are deaths and ashes, because disgusting people like Zen, like you, Alex,
and Putin, and his North Korean dearest friend, Kim Jong-un, think it is
"beautiful" to menace countries and to destroy cities and lives.  I prefer
music and poetry, but psichopaths see beauty in massacres, in censorship,
in menace people with all kind of arms, including the nuclear ones...
Err...  Sorry, Alex, considering the received pics, I think it will be much
better for you stay flirting with Putin.  Zen definitely does _not_ seem a
"Great Human Being" in any sense and he is sooo boring...  Putin, at least,
is beautiful and likes sex, even being a political corrupt monster...  Keep
licking him instead annoy the list.  It'll be a better way of "serving your
country", hihi!  ;)
Hmm...  Your middle fingers have boners too, Alex.  Interesting.  It
happens a lot on this list.  I never will be a patent troll, but it would
be hilarious to announce the patented "CypherPunk Viagra for Fingers", an
useful method for satisfying your lover!  The merchandising could be
"Because fingers make much more than typing!"  :D
Here in Brazil, the men say "Enquanto eu tiver língua e dedo, mulher
nenhuma me mete medo!", in a sexual reference to use very well tongue and
fingers when "the little pony doesn't want to ride", hahaha!!!  ;D
The bad translation would be something, more or less, like "While I have
tongue and fingers, no woman will scare me!"  (will be not satisfied).  :)
Pneumonias are boring.  Still feeling bad, really sick, but life is fun.  I
want to live, be happy and kick some asses before leaving forever.  :)
Lovely days and nights for all of you.  Tender wishes of joy and inner

Oh, I am dead, but it's Python...  (*-*) <3
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Thought I'd share my three-year project with the community.
The tl;dr is TFC is an end-to-end encryption plugin for Pidgin IM client
where the TCB is split and separated on two isolated computers behind
unidirectional, data-diode enforced RS232 gateways. This configuration
prevents infiltration of malware to transmitter computer and exfiltration
of keys/pt from receiver computer. The networked computer running Pidgin
never has access to private keys or plaintexts.
The cipher is XSalsa20-Poly1305, where the symmetric key is either
pre-shared or exchanged with Curve25519 ECDHE. MACs provide deniable
authentication and PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 provides per-message forward secrecy
with hash-ratchet.
Key generation uses Linux kernel CSPRNG but also allows mixing in entropy
from a HWRNG sampled by Raspberry Pi via GPIO natively or over SSH. (Both
HWRNG and data diodes are free hardware design).
Group messaging is done by multi-casting messages to each recipient
provided all members have exchanged a key pair for private messaging.
The last feature I'd like to highlight is trickle connection where user
sends a constant stream of noise packets to recipient / group, inside which
messages can be delivered. Files can be sent to recipient(s) in background
during the conversation.

Steve, my "cute-cute",  never was a werewolf, but already was a vampire
many years ago!  <3
You would be a Toreador, with absolutely sure.  I tried to be a Toreador
(poetry, music, red roses, etc),  but it didn't work for me.  I always was
a Malkavian, for coincidence, flirting with The Anarch Movement.  Chaos in
movement and destroy the "governments" because, you already know, some
vampires just wanna to have fun, la la la...  yay!  ;D
And now I am here, completely dead, haunting the list as ghost...  Booooh!
PS:  -  In Portuguese, there is the expression "cuti-cuti", which means,
more or less, "aww, cute, cute, cute!", usually used by children.  I am
being called "cuti-cuti" for so many years that it's a bit embarrassing.
In some tribunals and places, they need to _pretend_ respecting lawyers, so
I am called "Dr. Cuti-Cuti", hahaha!!!  ;D

Sorry, an important observation.  After receiving a very cruel and
aggressive private message, it's better to explain what I was trying to say.
When I said "more cypher", I was _not_ talking about cryptography, coding
and technical subjects only, but about more security and privacy
discussions, instead garbage like Russian political propaganda.
I am pure chaos and it seems contraditory, but I did mention "less punks",
asking for more focus, more emphasis in our present and future
surveillance.  We all, the whole world is very fucked and it will become
worse, much worse.  We can  -- at least try --  to minimize the impacts of
these bad things in the world, in our own lives, in the lives of our
beloved ones.
I was just asking for a little less of craziness and mess, for more focus
and rational discussions, not for censorship.
Sorry for my bad, ridiculous English.  Some people here have much free time
for sending more than 750 stupid spams and horrible, nasty messages
(number still increasing daily)  and searching beautiful words in the
dictionary to pretend some eloquence, but it is _not_ my case.
My English is a disaster, a shame, I recognize it.  At least, I can
understand well five languages, more or less one other, and I am learning
another one.  Oh, and I also know two Italian dialets.  I have no
perfection even in my own primary language, but I like words and reading,
searching for different ideas, learning more about other cultures.  Sorry
for using my so horrible and offensive English here.
Also, sorry for knowing "absolutely anything" about coding and
cryptography, for being so "stupid and limited" and deserving no respect
when asking for "more cypher".  I swear I am trying to become better in all
these aspects.
Thank you all for your patience with my insignificant existence.  I want a
better world to everybody.  I can't understand so much hate, so much
bitterness in some interactions.  I am pretending to be "dead" because I
was tired of so much useless noise, but some persons here are already dead
inside.  Really dead, with no good feelings or ideas to donate to the world.
Oh, and sorry for mentioning the Halloween.  I love it.  I did _not_
imagine it could be so offensive for some persons just for being a "North
American party".  We also celebrate it in my country, using Brazilian
cultural elements, our folklore and miths.
Wish you all happy days and nights, a lovely life.  Take care, guys!  ;)

Puuurrr...  rom rom rom, meow!  <3
---------- Forwarded message ----------

There's a new way to take down drones, and it doesn't involve shotguns
Now, a researcher has demonstrated a significantly more subtle and
proactive remedy that doesn't involve shotgun blasts or after-the-fact
arrests by law enforcement. It's a radio transmitter that seizes complete
control of nearby drones as they're in mid-flight. From then on, the drones
are under the full control of the person with the hijacking device. The
remote control in the possession of the original operator experiences a
loss of all functions, including steering, acceleration, and altitude. The
hack works against any drone that communicates over DSMx, a widely used
remote control protocol for operating hobbyist drones, planes, helicopters,
cars, and boats.
 - - -
There are interesting comments about which common protocols are actually
vulnerable to this attack, but perhaps much more to the point -- and this
aspect seems to almost always be overlooked in discussions
like this even though it should be obvious -- any flyer operating in
autonomous mode with the main radio purposely inoperative (it could be
programmed to enable briefly for takeoff and landing if necessary)
will be invulnerable to such attacks, and still be extremely capable -- in
most cases fully able to fly its entire programmed mission without
interference. This includes virtually all of the systems based on the
widely available open source ArduCopter code.

That's why the Soros foundation and other western LGBT orgs (the kind that
consider Chelsea Manning not worthy of an honorary place at the SF Pride

and is pretty much ignored.

Do you understand that? Promoting that conversation indicates an agenda. An
agenda that isn't in the interest of LGBTs of Russia. Kapiche?
Scusami, ma veramente non lo capisco, Razer.  One of my Russian friends and
his boyfriend were almost dead when kissing and demonstrating affection in
The police did with the both guys exactly what my first rapist did with
me:  strong kicks in the head and the whole body.  We stepped on our
bodies.  In the middle of the legs too.  I was burned with cigarretes
there.  My friends not, but they receiveid lots of kicks in the scrotum.
You probably can imagine how being kicked in the balls is painful.
Gays couples used to live with fear in Russia and Putin's homophobic
politicies make being gay there almost a crime, with no serious
investigations about their homicides and agressions, everything happens
with the State convenience.
It's enough for making me consider this situation unfair, illogical.  That
was the reason why they both run away and live in another country now.
They still love Russia and miss their country, their families, but want to
walking around, hand in hand, kissing each other, without being judged and

political theory though.
Definition of neurotic:  I will learn something more useful for me than hating the USA, Juan.  I am
finishing the reading of an interesting book named "Speaking Code: Coding
as Aesthetic and Political Expression" and I am thinking about new
eletronics projects for making children laughing in the Halloween.
Candies, electronics and happy kids make me feel blessed for still being
alive.  Politics and corrupt and hypocrite politicians make me strongly
wish the suicide again.  Do you understand the difference?  :)
I am tired of pompous people auto-denominating themselves "activists",
speaking and writing millions of empty words, without saying something
really relevant, like Zenaan, for example, always does.  I want to code and
to create new ideas, to make new things.  I want to learn and I always said
it since the beggining.
I am still reading all the suggested bibliography about Anarchism and I am
really grateful for all the wonderful references, but I am making _my own
interpretations_ of all the texts.  I am my own cat and all the places are
mine, do you remember?  I make my own choices, wrong or not.
I always read several books and texts at same time and, it definitely isn't
practical, but makes me happy.  It's fun to think about cute pink unicorns
and how to destroy governments at same time.
I prefer learn how to coding well than the ABC of political theory, if it
will make me a neurotic, who will see USA, military forces or fanatic
religions in every disaster that happens in the world.  Did Hurricane
Matthew destroy Haiti because of USA military too?  Was it lack of faith?

electrons.  They obviously forgot to mention morons too.  :P
Ok, I am a moron.  Now, my dear, why so much hate in this little heart
today?  :)
First of all, sorry, but it's obvious that the mentioned choices  - "White
Supremacist lists", "Misogynist sites" and "Nambla" -  have much more your
profile than mine...  :P
1)  I am _not_ a Caucasian male like you.  The White Supremacists don't
like "yellow people", poor "Japs" girls who live in the Third World like
me.  Snif, snif...  I feel so rejected for the nazi bad guys...  :'(
2)  You have problems to accept the GLBTQ rights, not me.  I accept and
support all of them.  You can confirm it with all the rainbows in the sky,
la la la!  :)
3)  And about little boys and little girls, yes, you are right, my dear.  I
love them very much.  I used to be a baby sitter when were a very young
student and, well, I always wanted to be a mother, but I had no much luck
and just became a cute auntie for my friend's kids.  Not an "imperial
auntie" like you.  Just the single girl who buys candies, toys, tells bed
time stories with happy endings and sings old lullabies...
But if you really want to act like an angry teenager, no problem, I can do
exactly the same and better than you, dear.  You do know it.  My English is
a disaster, but I am fluent in Moron, Troll, Cecilian and several strange
dialets.  :)
I certainly have less free time in my hands than you, but I don't like
unfair public threats, Razer.  Less drama, please.  Grown up and act like
an adult man.  Or, at least, eat chocolate or take a probiotic yogurt.  Bad
mood is boring!  :(
It was just to ask me to avoid mention your sacrated name in vain.  More
easy, less unpleasent for everybody...  Aff, men are always more dramatic
than women...  So much useless noise, bah...  :(
Well, I love you.  If you annoy me again, I will say your name three
times.  It works with Beetlejuice and Bloody Mary.  If I do it, you will be
in the Banana Republic and I bet you don't dance samba!  :D

Mirimir, my love, thank you very much for your kind intervention, but
please just relax and forget all this discussion.  Too much ado about
nothing, dear.  ;)
I really don't care about this kind of childish menace.  I don't respect
coward people and I don't have patience with brats, too pampered kids.
Razer thinks that his shit stinks less than mine, what is very usual in
North-American ego trips.  It isn't true.  It's excrement the same way.
Fifty bucks is "cheap" for him, a white, male, North-American.  For a
Brazilian woman is not a so low value and I prefer to donate my money to
good institutions, that I really respect and trust.  'Nambla' is his
choice, not mine.
I always loved Razer very much, but the next time I try the suicide, I will
climb his ego and jump, aff...  It will certainly be more fatal than jump
off the Golden Gate Bridge!  (+-+)*
Please, Razer, try to rest a bit, eat something and keep hydrated.
Consider sex/masturbation, chocolate and probiotic yogurt.  Your mood is
really bad today, aff...  :-/
Kisses and hugs, my dear.  I love you very much *when you are not kicking
me*.  Instead donate cash to Nambla, kick them, not me.  They are the bad

My dear Razer,
Being sincere, after your hysteric attack  (aka "direct threat"),  all the
trolls and haters of the cypherpunks list love us both.  And rooty is not a
bot, it's just a creepy, retard teenager, provoking some persons for the
lulz.  Search better, hard headed.
I already received some strange messages as courtesy of your lovely public
suggestions.  If you won't subscribe me on bizarre mailings, someone will
do it pretending to be you.  Should I thank you, my dear?
Congratulations, you humiliated me in public and fucked my e-mail
address...  Are you happy now?  Did you have orgasms knowing I would cry
and feel broken hearted, betrayed, exposed?
You got all the attentions today like an amazing rock star and exposed me
and the private messages sent by Mirimir.  You showed your true colors.
You are not a trustful person and I am disappointed.
I always admired you a lot, but now I will never trust in you again.  I
loved you, your messages, your humanity, your intelligence, everything.
Now, please, forget my "fake existence" and never write to me again.
You hurt me much more than imagine and simply don't care if I am well or
not, you just want to prove me that you are right, that never are wrong.
You wrote me in private just to hurt me again.  More and more drama.  Do

Take care and be happy, my love.  When you are not being neurotic and

Razer, hysterical as always.
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Well, your concept of "hysterical" is certainly different from mine, my
dear Razer.  Maybe a cultural difference.  :-/
Hysterical, for me, means "marked by uncontrollable, extreme emotion" and
when a person makes a public direct threat, I suppose this person is _not_
being calm and acting in a rational way.  Here, in Brazil, it's considered
hysterical, crazy, dramatical.  Do you understand my point of view?  :-/
I believe in you, Razer, but *you* gave the awesome idea in a public list,
mentioning my name and giving those lovely sites and lists as examples.
Should I thank you for it, my dear?
INTERESTED IN YOU DOING FOR ME TOO.

Razer, you are a very intelligent man.  You know it and I always admired
your intelligence, your direct way of speaking about your own believes,
your sincerity.
So why the fuck you simply didn't ask me in private to avoid mention your
name in my messages, explaining the reasons, instead making a creepy and
dramatic public threat?
The passional Nipo-Latin here is me, not you!  My Jew boyfriend was very
sweet, but extremely rational.  Guy, you studied a lot for being fair and
rational!  Let the passion thing for me, a Latin girl, please!  :P
Man, that message was insane!  I was in doubt if you were joking with me or
really threating me in public.  Please, be very *clear* in the next
messages and avoid these bizarre misunderstandings!
You always had the most complete freedom to say me everything you wanted in
private or in public.  You could simply say something like "Fuck you,
Ceci!  Stop talking to trolls!"  or  "Never say Razer in vain, because all
the holy books (or whatever) say it's forbidden, a mortal sin!"...
Shit, I love you.  Why would I ignore your asking?  You hurt me a lot just
because you did want it.  So, please, let me in peace.  I need a time for

@_subject: Fwd: <nettime> #jakegate explained ... by a Dummy 
NB Two days ago, The Guardian newspaper published a long article
about Jacob Appelbaum, the first text in mainstream media since
the two pieces in Die Zeit Online (see refs below), and only the
second publication I am aware of since the storm around 'Jake' abated
somewhere in last Summer.
This post was largely written in Romania a few weeks ago, and hence
is not informed by the article in The Guardian. It also looks at the
whole affair from a different angle, less focused on the person(age)
 explained by ... a Dummy
Well, since there are so many texts written for dummies, I thought
it would be nice to have one ... written by one. And as you see, I
carefully choose my subject ...
The story going by the moniker  is, I assume largely known
by nettime readers, but here's for an ultra-short ExecSum all the
same: Jacob Appelbaum, aka ‘Jake’ is a prominent hacker-activist
whose precipitous fall from grace and reputation has stunned the
digerati scene. End May/begin of June this year (2016), organisations
at the forefront of the battles for privacy and security like the TOR
project, the CCC, Debian, and others, quite brutally scuttled him
amidst accusation of (longstanding) sexual and social misbehaviour.
But by now a backlash has also occurred as the same organisations
stand accused of precipitate, non-transparent, and largely unfounded
decision making - all this with 'Jake' himself largely disappearing
from view.
My reason for writing this piece is to try to understand - even if
largely for my own sake – the circumstances and group processes
that have been at work in creating this rather startling, though
not totally unanticipated fracas. As a general disclaimer, I should
reiterate that I am truly a dummy in this, in the sense that I am not
an insider, even if I know a few ones. And all I do know stems from
publicly available sources, of course supplemented by a few private
talks – but don’t expect confidential information to be disclosed,
since there was actually none. I do know Jake personally however,
since 2003, and I have followed his activities ever since, be it
from quite a distance. Also 'Jake' knows who I am and has always be
very friendly to me, but we have always been distant acquaintances
nonetheless. In short, my locus standi is situated at the 'core
periphery' to the circles and activities Jake was or is related with -
to use a swanky term Geert Lovink and I once made up.
It may be needless to add and emphasize that ‘ is a very
‘complicated’ issue (as in Facebook), and that I tried to write
about it, following Tacitus, ‘sine ira et studio’ ...
I have structured this text in four sections (plus a concluding
part): Jake’s persona(ge); his social circle, mostly in Berlin; the
organisations he is (was) part of; and the the wider, bad world of
surveillance and repression this constituency is facing and combating.
These sections cannot, however, be strictly separated, they flow and
must weave readily together towards the concluding remarks on the
 backlash and beyond.
On Jake’s persona(ge)
It is self evident that Jake's character, as it appears to his social
environment’s bystanders and to observers at large, provides a
substantial, if by way insufficient, explanation of ‘
Even with some allowances, Jacob Appelbaum might be taken as
exemplary for the phenomenon of a gifted, extrovert geek rising to
prominence, not to say ‘rock star’ status, amidst the general
hacker alternative, and mainstream, media hype. The by now fairly well
documented mix of autism (-lite), mental (over)activity, sociopathy
(-lite), maybe best captured by the German word ‘Drang’ - the
‘urge’ to do ‘something’ - can all be observed, and then in no
small measure, with Jacob Appelbaum. Add precociousness and young age,
and you have the potent combination which might largely – but again,
not entirely – explain how 'Jake' ended up in the predicament that
is now his.
On Jake’s social environment and the groups he is/was in - in
Berlin, mostly.
Another tentative, partial explanation may be found in the nature
and ongoings within the social circles 'Jake' has been moving in the
past years in Berlin, that ‘poor but sexy’ capital which had
overtaken Amsterdam as the place to be if you are young, worldly,
engaged - and poor and sexy. From the early 2000's the city had
become an international magnet to all sorts of creative people and
voluntary organisations, eager to contribute to the “an other world
is possible” idea. Berlin has obvious ‘locational’ advantages
in terms of situation in the geographical and political centre of
Europe and because of its convenience in terms of affordable housing,
cheap food, and a dynamic cultural life (with a frothy night scene to
boot). But it is also the political climate and constitutional set-up
of Germany that had made Berlin a place of choice for ‘technological
refugees’, mostly from the USA, and thanks to its thriving IT scene,
also a hotbed of digital political activism.
Yet at the same time it should be noted that these circles are not
that large - in the low hundreds in terms of number of members –
and that they are more close-knit and culturally, demographically,
and socially homogeneous than is normally the case in the larger
society. In short, young (20/30-ish), single, english speaking, sort
of full time artists/activists in one way or another. Add to this
the pressure of operating against, and hence enduring the special
attention cum repression from the Surveillance Empire, which makes it
easy to imagine a situation where one is living permanently at the
edge, with all its accompanying features like red eye nights, sexual
promiscuity, alcohol and substance (ab)use, and what have you. A
perfect setting for a scenario whose script can easily veer into all
kinds of, err, ‘configurations’ ...
On the organisations Jake works or has worked for
Following on the factual demise of parliamentary political parties,
trade unions, and of the ‘quality’ press as avenues of criticism
and influencing the governance process, the 'NGO-isation of advocacy
and of politics at large has led to the rise of a large number of
voluntary initiatives, whose common characteristics - for the majority
of them - appears to be small in size, and to be run by far too few
underpaid (or not paid at all) people chasing far too many issues at
the same time. This often results in near-mandatory commitment to a
24/7 work schedule, with its concomitant risks of stress, burnout,
wayward behaviour, etc. This is especially the case with those
outfits focusing on the variegated and nefarious manifestations of
the 'deep state' (see below), and then more particularly in the realm
of surveillance and repression. It is clear that such organisations
and their personnel are themselves 'targets', not to say fair game,
for the aforementioned deep state's agencies and services, and this
equally on a 24/7 footing. Another aspect is that such outfits,
despite their small size, 'enjoy' an inordinately large, and usually
sensationalist media coverage every time they manage to uncover yet
another 'scandal', enhancing at the same time their popularity among
some sections of the public (academics, activists, 'progressive'
people). This all makes for a very heady atmosphere, difficult both to
avoid and to resist. And this has been Jake's 'natural biotope' for
quite a number of years past.
Their good work in exposing states' misbehaviour, and even crimes
notwithstanding, such organisations have their dark sides also. Their
small size results in a very limited number of people, or even a
single person (as in a SPO, Single Person Organisation) acting without
very much of an oversight, if at all. To this. organisations involved
in the more 'sensitive' aspects of politics add an extra, justifiable
but nonetheless secretive, opaque layer to their activities. Which
in turn often leads to a permanent state of paranoia, a tunnel
vision due to over-focussing on the outfit's specific issues (at
the expense of looking at the world at large - or at life itself),
and generally a form of dogmatism in both their internal and their
external functioning. It had also as reverse a clear tendency to
delusion of grandeur, exaggerating the importance and the impact of
both the group(s) and the issues at stake among the general public.
And then, also the effects of cut-throat competition in the permanent
hunt for funding and attention among such outfits should not be
overlooked. Finally, both their rhetorics as they working practices
are essentially not that far removed from the modus operandi of
commercial (IT) start-ups, with whom they appear to share (almost)
the same recruitment demographics: young, bright, dynamic, hip - and
The unhappy conclusion is that such organisations are always at risk,
in the end, to veer towards becoming ineffective at best, and morally
bankrupt at worst. Looking, for instance, at the recent management and
political decision-making processes at the TOR foundation triggered by
' don't make one overly optimistic.
On the wider (and bad) world of big government, big corporation, and
their oppressive practices of surveillance and control.
First, I think we need to realize that, in society at large, the
number of people truly concerned, and actively engaging, with the
above issue is incredibly tiny (and shockingly so, even if it is
slowly growing). To most citizens, this is a 'far-from-my-bed-show',
and one they feel utterly powerless about at the same time. Activists
and their organisations sometimes achieve a big media breakthrough and
subsequent, but ephemeral, hype (Wikileaks, Snowden), but most of the
time, awareness, concern, and hence political consequences remain at
a low level, which might in part explain why measures progressively
regulating and restraining citizen's rights and liberties end up so
smoothly in the statute books.
But near-zero awareness is surely not what can be ascribed to the
corporate intelligence contractors banding together with secretive
government agencies, a complex best represented by the concept
of 'deep state'(*). While the former 'partners' are primarily
concerned with protecting and extending their business interests
- which includes supporting, or at least not opposing, the most
outlandish repressive measures by the state agencies when it suits
them, the latter, on the other hand, will go in the end for outright
elimination, physical if necessary, of their opponents and critics, be
it individual or groups. These are the forces groups and organisations
'Jake' works(/ed) for are confronting - making them clear targets.
How precisely and to what extent is difficult to ascertain - beyond
at points of obvious contact, in the form of protracted harassment at
border crossings for instance. This gives rise to speculations fast
drifting into conspiracy theories - something that is not entirely to
the displeasure of aforementioned agencies. I neither wish nor can say
very much more about this, save than to presume that the situation is
both pretty much calamitous and also not amenable to any (re)solution.
Resistance may be the answer to what has probably become the essential
constitutional issue of our times, but I am afraid not to see a
positive outcome evolving unless it mutates into a real law and order
problem for the powers that be. And this is in my view exactly the
point where the above mentioned organisations and their associates,
supporters, and techie-activists fail to enact the effective mix of
political strategy, street-level tactics, and technological fixes,
usually by prioritizing the last option at the expense of the two
In conclusion
As could be read, I have not at all addressed the question of Jacob
Appelbaum's (very?) possible culpability in the matter of sexual
harassment and uncivil/a-social behaviour - the mainstay of the
 brouhaha. This is on purpose, since all evidence, as evinced
in various interventions by equally various parties, point, to use
Facebook's inimitable phrase, towards a 'it's complicated' verdict.
Nonetheless, what I think is more important at this stage, also in
view of the above mentioned evidence, or alleged lack thereof, is the
conclusions the groups and organisations involved, as well as 'Jake'
himself will draw for the future, and how his personal situation
will evolve as a consequence. Now that he has been expelled from
pretty much all the outfits he was associated with (Wikilekas appear
to be an exception, for reasons that may - or may not - be easily
guessed) the question is one of what 'Jake' is going to do next.
For better or for worse, what has happened is beyond recall. With
his 'rockstar' status clearly revoked - a good thing - I believe
it is important for 'Jake' to start afresh and find sustainable
footing in a much more modest and withdrawn role, something that is
also the responsibility of his (former) 'Umfeld to make possible,
or at the very least not to try to thwart it in a senseless pursuit
of revenge. I am thinking of his pursuance of a Phd at Eindhoven
Technical University, something that could constitute a perfect
opportunity for retreat and 'reconfiguration'.
To people who feel they have been to have been aggrieved by 'Jake'
one way or another, and they might have good reasons to feel so,
I would suggest that some 'truth and atonement' get together be
organised, say in one year from now. In the end, whatever the way one
wishes to describe those concerned by or involved in ' in
terms of a community (and that might also include some people in the
nettime readership), then that 'we' must strive, immo, to overcome the
conflict by learning its lessons ("no more rockstars" would be a good
starter), and not repeat the same mistakes, neither at the individual,
nor at the collective level.

nonsense. Your words make no sense at all.
* * *  I received more agressive messages, but I am copying the CypherPunks
list only in this specific answer to advertise the members that there is a
_fake profile_ using my real name.  * * *
Dear 'Fake Profile', aka 'Alex',
Please, consider seriously to study English better and learn the
differences between the words "thread" and "threat".
What you are doing with me in this moment is a "threat", a menace using my
own name and a fake account.  I don't create "threats", my dear.  I receive
them, like now.  :)
Please, consider to use a good English dictionary, Alexander.  The word
"threat" can be used as a substantive or a principal verb.  It doesn't need
the use of the verb "to create".
"Useless nonsense" is creating a fake account just to write a message using
an English worst than mine.  Tsk, tsk...  What a shame, bad boy!
I admiss I am too lazy to use the dictionary in all the moments, but if you
want to use my name in a fake profile, please, be less repetitive and use a
better grammar.  I am annoying, but not so stupid like you.
I will stop posting _only_ if I want it.  Why would be acceptable for you
to be an idiot and posting here and not for me?  It's very unfair, dear.
Hey, Razer told you about the message that I sent him yesterday, asking
peace, begging to stop with this kind of garbage on the list?  He respected
our deal.  Please, be rational and stop the bullying too.
Grown up and get a life, Alex.  A real one, not a profile at 'Second Life'
game or my fake profile, ok?  Believe me, I am more beautiful and charming
than you.  And you're a bit older and hairy too, hoho...  :)
Cecilia Tanaka, the real one!  ;)

Sorry, I will be very, very busy making my fabulous manicure, so I will

I am not Muslim, but I live next to a Mosque and already studied and worked
with Muslims.  All I had seem in all these years is respect, honor and
tolerance.  I respect them very much.
I am very proud of living in the center of my city, next to Catholic
Churches, Budhist Temples, Spiritualist Houses, Mosques, Synagogues and
several other religious places.  It is very beautiful to see the faith, the
eternal human search for answers.
Sorry for my bad comportament in the list.  I am not so vain or cruel.  I
received some disgusting messages and was provoking my haters, but the
manicure story was true, hihi!  :)
One of my voluntary works with female transgenders is teaching them how to
use make up, making their own manicure, feel secure using high wheels...
It seems futile for most of the people, but they are very fragile, still
working their self esteem, learning how to show to the world their gender,
to express themselves.  I cried a lot when I see one of them feeling more
beautiful, more feminine, absolutely amazing just because of a baby pink
lipstick.  :)
Sometimes, I receive some beauty products  (make up, nail polishes,
shampoos, creams, etc)  to test new brands and write reviews to beauty
sites and blogs.  I was very good at it, but I always am only a ghost
writer and a ghost model for hands and feet, haha!!  ;)
I use most of the products with "my girls" or donate some little kits to
asylums.  Older women like to feel more "colored", more beautiful too.  I
like the idea of working with their self esteem, to remember them how
beautiful they are, how beautiful and colored the world is.  They are
living flowers.  It's a simple thing, but they feel more motived to walking
and making exercises, to fight against their depression and eventual health
problems.  :)
Now, after healing of this new worst pneumonia and discover what's
happening in my work  (money troubles, money troubles everywhere!),  I want
to make some work with the refugees living in my city, teaching a bit more
of Portuguese to the children.
The kids are so smart, so amazing!  They learn everything so fast and just
want to be happy, to study, to hug the other children.  They saw what means
a war, so they love the peace, they love to play...  All the meals for them
are great, even the simplest ones, because they were starving when arrived
here...  :(
One of my friends is a Japanese girl, some years older than me.  When she
arrived in my country, she had the same problems that my parents had.  She
only knowed the Japanese language.  One day, in the school, with 5 years
old, she needed to go to the bathroom and didn't know how to say it in
She made her necessities in the class, crying, feeling humiliated,
listening to the laugh of the other students, because her teacher screamed
several times with her, asking to return to the chair and she didn't
understood anything.
I don't want these poor children suffer the same bullying that my parents,
their friends and my friend suffered.  My French is old garbage, I don't
speak Crioulo, but well, I can learn their languages and they can learn
Portuguese...  And after, with more time and $resource$, programming
languages too!  :)
I promise I will treat myself better, my dear Cari.  Thank you.  Please,
take care of yourself with tenderness too!  :*
Kisses and hugs from Brazil!  <3

Sorry for the bad joke/confession, but in the beginning, I thought it was
very ridiculous when someone mentioned that I could be a "man" using a

I don't care about being a low profile nerd.  It only means I recognize the

If you want to see the climate changes in person, spend some time in my

my former girlfriends job was working with disabled children. She regularly
worked with girls in their teens who couldn't even speak, not a single
word. They were SEVERELY cognitively impaired. Their diagnosis was autism,
nothing more.
I won't have patience now for searching the correct thread on the cpunks
list, but Juan had a long and very, very exhaustive discussion about
autistic children with Xorcist few weeks ago.
Xorcist has an autistic niece, who loves a lot and considers like a
daughter, and makes voluntary work with disabled children too.  He told
some stories about his convivence with her, his attempts of stimulate her
senses, her intelligence, and about her difficulties to understand the
world and the people.  It was beautiful because he was talking about love.
True love.
I usually try to use music as stimulus for all ages, in all situations.
Music is life, and all the words have sounds, and these sounds are music
I think Xorcist would like to exchange some ideas with your girlfriend
about what he can do for his loved niece and all the other kids that he is
helping.  He has a tender heart and is a very old cpunk.
I will tell you a secret: - when Juan is not being annoying and aggressive,
he is a very dear person, but extremely hard headed.  He has a head so, so
hard that I can break coconuts using it and he won't change his ideas.  :P
He certainly would help me to make voluntary work with disabled children
just to prove me how much I am very, very wrong, hihi!  In some moments, I
want to kick his balls, but I like him!  :)

Faith in people, faith in science, faith in technology, my dear Juan.
Always hoping the people can create better technologies, more precise

more human, fairer, with less pain and crying.  A world without the human
misery:  wars, hunger, diseases, lack of potable water, etc...
control the biggest number of people in the most 'efficient' way.
People don't need any technology to kill each other and manipulate, control
innocent lives using menaces, fear, cruelty...  :(
'friends' at google and the rest of 'captains' of 'industry'.
So change this, make something to fight against the death of the privacy,
instead complaining about Google using a gmail account, my dear.
the importance of technical knowledge to help the people.
I can use my knifes to cook or to kill.  My choice, my responsability,
dear.  You can use the same instruments and ideas in different ways.
Why do you think my thoughts are 'propaganda' and not yours, my dear?
Why is it not true, dear?  It's my opinion, but there are several different
opinions in the world about the same facts.
Points of view are very subjective, influenced by personal backgrounds and
beliefs.  I can't say with absolute and complete certain that my opinion is
the only real truth.  Tolerance and respect, my dear.

take turns?  So you can rest and choose better days for you, hahaha!!!  ;D
Please, talking seriously, bite your girlfriend or more interesting

and it is not exactly the case...  Too much Vegemite!  :)
because i know it's gonna be super stupid or super ugly (the same refers to

Hey, it's good!  Thanks, Alex!  I love when people calls me "Tanaka"!  It's
my surname and I absolutely love it.  My family's legacy for me, my
heritage, my origins, my blood.  In Japanese, we always say the blood is
stronger (denser) than the water.  <3
Your friend Zen saw "artistic beauty" when a nuclear bomb killed great part
of Tanaka family, who still lived in Hiroshima.  Part of my family heritage
are deaths and ashes, because disgusting people like Zen, like you, Alex,
and Putin, and his North Korean dearest friend, Kim Jong-un, think it is
"beautiful" to menace countries and to destroy cities and lives.  I prefer
music and poetry, but psichopaths see beauty in massacres, in censorship,
in menace people with all kind of arms, including the nuclear ones...
Err...  Sorry, Alex, considering the received pics, I think it will be much
better for you stay flirting with Putin.  Zen definitely does _not_ seem a
"Great Human Being" in any sense and he is sooo boring...  Putin, at least,
is beautiful and likes sex, even being a political corrupt monster...  Keep
licking him instead annoy the list.  It'll be a better way of "serving your
country", hihi!  ;)
Hmm...  Your middle fingers have boners too, Alex.  Interesting.  It
happens a lot on this list.  I never will be a patent troll, but it would
be hilarious to announce the patented "CypherPunk Viagra for Fingers", an
useful method for satisfying your lover!  The merchandising could be
"Because fingers make much more than typing!"  :D
Here in Brazil, the men say "Enquanto eu tiver língua e dedo, mulher
nenhuma me mete medo!", in a sexual reference to use very well tongue and
fingers when "the little pony doesn't want to ride", hahaha!!!  ;D
The bad translation would be something, more or less, like "While I have
tongue and fingers, no woman will scare me!"  (will be not satisfied).  :)
Pneumonias are boring.  Still feeling bad, really sick, but life is fun.  I
want to live, be happy and kick some asses before leaving forever.  :)
Lovely days and nights for all of you.  Tender wishes of joy and inner

Oh, I am dead, but it's Python...  (*-*) <3
---------- Forwarded message ----------
Thought I'd share my three-year project with the community.
The tl;dr is TFC is an end-to-end encryption plugin for Pidgin IM client
where the TCB is split and separated on two isolated computers behind
unidirectional, data-diode enforced RS232 gateways. This configuration
prevents infiltration of malware to transmitter computer and exfiltration
of keys/pt from receiver computer. The networked computer running Pidgin
never has access to private keys or plaintexts.
The cipher is XSalsa20-Poly1305, where the symmetric key is either
pre-shared or exchanged with Curve25519 ECDHE. MACs provide deniable
authentication and PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 provides per-message forward secrecy
with hash-ratchet.
Key generation uses Linux kernel CSPRNG but also allows mixing in entropy
from a HWRNG sampled by Raspberry Pi via GPIO natively or over SSH. (Both
HWRNG and data diodes are free hardware design).
Group messaging is done by multi-casting messages to each recipient
provided all members have exchanged a key pair for private messaging.
The last feature I'd like to highlight is trickle connection where user
sends a constant stream of noise packets to recipient / group, inside which
messages can be delivered. Files can be sent to recipient(s) in background
during the conversation.

Sorry, an important observation.  After receiving a very cruel and
aggressive private message, it's better to explain what I was trying to say.
When I said "more cypher", I was _not_ talking about cryptography, coding
and technical subjects only, but about more security and privacy
discussions, instead garbage like Russian political propaganda.
I am pure chaos and it seems contraditory, but I did mention "less punks",
asking for more focus, more emphasis in our present and future
surveillance.  We all, the whole world is very fucked and it will become
worse, much worse.  We can  -- at least try --  to minimize the impacts of
these bad things in the world, in our own lives, in the lives of our
beloved ones.
I was just asking for a little less of craziness and mess, for more focus
and rational discussions, not for censorship.
Sorry for my bad, ridiculous English.  Some people here have much free time
for sending more than 750 stupid spams and horrible, nasty messages
(number still increasing daily)  and searching beautiful words in the
dictionary to pretend some eloquence, but it is _not_ my case.
My English is a disaster, a shame, I recognize it.  At least, I can
understand well five languages, more or less one other, and I am learning
another one.  Oh, and I also know two Italian dialets.  I have no
perfection even in my own primary language, but I like words and reading,
searching for different ideas, learning more about other cultures.  Sorry
for using my so horrible and offensive English here.
Also, sorry for knowing "absolutely anything" about coding and
cryptography, for being so "stupid and limited" and deserving no respect
when asking for "more cypher".  I swear I am trying to become better in all
these aspects.
Thank you all for your patience with my insignificant existence.  I want a
better world to everybody.  I can't understand so much hate, so much
bitterness in some interactions.  I am pretending to be "dead" because I
was tired of so much useless noise, but some persons here are already dead
inside.  Really dead, with no good feelings or ideas to donate to the world.
Oh, and sorry for mentioning the Halloween.  I love it.  I did _not_
imagine it could be so offensive for some persons just for being a "North
American party".  We also celebrate it in my country, using Brazilian
cultural elements, our folklore and miths.
Wish you all happy days and nights, a lovely life.  Take care, guys!  ;)

Puuurrr...  rom rom rom, meow!  <3

There's a new way to take down drones, and it doesn't involve shotguns
Now, a researcher has demonstrated a significantly more subtle and
proactive remedy that doesn't involve shotgun blasts or after-the-fact
arrests by law enforcement. It's a radio transmitter that seizes complete
control of nearby drones as they're in mid-flight. From then on, the drones
are under the full control of the person with the hijacking device. The
remote control in the possession of the original operator experiences a
loss of all functions, including steering, acceleration, and altitude. The
hack works against any drone that communicates over DSMx, a widely used
remote control protocol for operating hobbyist drones, planes, helicopters,
cars, and boats.
 - - -
There are interesting comments about which common protocols are actually
vulnerable to this attack, but perhaps much more to the point -- and this
aspect seems to almost always be overlooked in discussions
like this even though it should be obvious -- any flyer operating in
autonomous mode with the main radio purposely inoperative (it could be
programmed to enable briefly for takeoff and landing if necessary)
will be invulnerable to such attacks, and still be extremely capable -- in
most cases fully able to fly its entire programmed mission without
interference. This includes virtually all of the systems based on the
widely available open source ArduCopter code.

---------- Forwarded message ----------
August 26, 2016
A feminist internet works towards empowering more women and queer
persons – in all our diversities – to fully enjoy our rights, engage in
pleasure and play, and dismantle patriarchy. This integrates our
different realities, contexts and specificities – including age,
disabilities, sexualities, gender identities and expressions,
socioeconomic locations, political and religious beliefs, ethnic
origins, and racial markers. The following key principles are critical
towards realising a feminist internet.
1 Access to the internet
A feminist internet starts with enabling more women and queer persons to
enjoy universal, acceptable, affordable, unconditional, open, meaningful
and equal access to the internet.
2 Access to information
We support and protect unrestricted access to information relevant to
women and queer persons, particularly information on sexual and
reproductive health and rights, pleasure, safe abortion, access to
justice, and LGBTIQ issues. This includes diversity in languages,
abilities, interests and contexts.
3 Usage of technology
Women and queer persons have the right to code, design, adapt and
critically and sustainably use ICTs and reclaim technology as a platform
for creativity and expression, as well aschallenge the cultures of
sexism and discrimination in all spaces.
__Movements & public participation
4 Resistance
The internet is a space where social norms are negotiated, performed and
imposed, often in an extension of other spaces shaped by patriarchy and
heteronormativity. Our struggle for a feminist internet is one that
forms part of a continuum of our resistance in other spaces, public,
private and in-between.
5 Movement building
The internet is a transformative political space. It facilitates new
forms of citizenship that enable individuals to claim, construct and
express selves, genders and sexualities. This includes connecting across
territories, demanding accountability and transparency, and creating
opportunities for sustained feminist movement building.
6 Internet governance
We believe in challenging the patriarchal spaces and processes that
control internet governance, as well as putting more feminists and
queers at the decision-making tables. We want to democratise policy
making affecting the internet as well as diffuse ownership of and power
in global and local networks.
7. Alternative economies
We are committed to interrogating the capitalist logic that drives
technology towards further privatisation, profit and corporate control.
We work to create alternative forms of economic power that are grounded
in principles of cooperation, solidarity, commons, environmental
sustainability, and openness.
8. Free and open source
We are committed to creating and experimenting with technology,
including digital safety and security, and using free/libre and open
source software (FLOSS), tools, and platforms. Promoting, disseminating,
and sharing knowledge about the use of FLOSS is central to our praxis.
9 Amplifying feminist discourse
We claim the power of the internet to amplify women’s narratives and
lived realities. There is a need to resist the state, the religious
right and other extremist forces who monopolise discourses of morality,
while silencing feminist voices and persecuting women’s human rights
10 Freedom of expression
We defend the right to sexual expression as a freedom of expression
issue of no less importance than political or religious expression. We
strongly object to the efforts of state and non-state actors to control,
surveil, regulate and restrict feminist and queer expression on the
Internet through technology, legislation or violence. We recognise this
as part of the larger political project of moral policing, censorship,
and hierarchisation of citizenship and rights.
11 Pornography and “harmful content”
We recognise that the issue of pornography online has to do with agency,
consent, power and labour. We reject simple causal linkages made between
consumption of pornographic content and violence against women. We also
reject the use of the umbrella term “harmful content”label expression on
female and transgender sexuality. We support reclaiming and creating
alternative erotic content that resists the mainstream patriarchal gaze
and locates women and queer persons’ desires at the centre.
12 Consent
We call on the need to build an ethics and politics of consent into the
culture, design, policies and terms of service of internet platforms.
Women’s agency lies in their ability to make informed decisions on what
aspects of their public or private lives to share online.
13 Privacy and data
We support the right to privacy and to full control over personal data
and information online at all levels. We reject practices by states and
private companies to use data for profit and to manipulate behaviour
online. Surveillance is the historical tool of patriarchy, used to
control and restrict women’s bodies, speech and activism. We pay equal
attention to surveillance practices by individuals, the private sector,
the state and non-state actors.
14 Memory
We have the right to exercise and retain control over our personal
history and memory on the internet. This includes being able to access
all our personal data and information online, and to be able to exercise
control over this data, including knowing who has access to it and under
what conditions, and the ability to delete it forever.
15 Anonymity
We defend the right to be anonymous and reject all claims to restrict
anonymity online. Anonymity enables our freedom of expression online,
particularly when it comes to breaking taboos of sexuality and
heteronormativity, experimenting with gender identity, and enabling
safety for women and queer persons affected by discrimination.
16 Children and youth
We call for the inclusion of the voices and experiences of young people
in the decisions made about safety and security online and promote their
safety, privacy, and access to information. We recognise children’s
right to healthy emotional and sexual development, which includes the
right to privacy and access to positive information about sex, gender
and sexuality at critical times in their lives.
17 Online violence
We call on all internet stakeholders, including internet users, policy
makers and the private sector, to address the issue of online harassment
and technology-related violence. The attacks, threats, intimidation and
policing experienced by women and queers are real, harmful and alarming,
and are part of the broader issue of gender-based violence. It is our
collective responsibility to address and end this.

the first message, seeing the life in a not too serious way.  This thread
is full of shit about Jake and it has begin with a slander.  Jake deserves
joy, laugh, smiles, tickles, snugglehugs, cupcakes and our love.
The JA Group deserves laugh too, but because they are a bad joke.  A stupid
lynch mob, which used slanders and lies to erase the joy of Jake's life.
Jake is alive, is a winner and is very happy all the times when one more
lie is finally considered false in public.  I miss the happy Jake,
laughing, smiling and I want to listen to his laugh in public again, maybe
cooking onions with him.  ;)
His life is still a celebration, because he always had a hard life and is a
winner.  Who knows how hard his life was, knows he always will be a
winner.  Jake is someone that I love and I am proud to call "my friend"!

It remembers me two sad musics.  Not exactly their rhythms, but their
lyrics are very melancholic and hopeless.
The beggining of "American Pie" is pretty slow and delicate.  I prefer when
the music becomes faster, more beautiful and, at same time, more anguished
and sad.  The Madonna's version is more energetic and dancing, but this
original versional is more nostalgic, more "uncomfortable" for me.
*  American Pie  (Don McLean):  "Born in USA" has a great energy, the powerful voice of Springsteen and a
contagious enthusiasm, but it is not about the joy or the pride of being
North American.  It's a sad song about people trying to live their simple
lives, going to non sense wars, without understand why kill or die, because
of the USA government.  Returning of wars with no support, no dreams, no

---------- Forwarded message ----------
"Listen, Mark, this is serious. First you create rules that don’t
distinguish between child pornography and famous war photographs. Then
you practice these rules without allowing space for good judgement.
Finally you even censor criticism against and a discussion about the
decision – and you punish the person who dares to voice criticism.
To be honest, I have no illusions that you will read this letter.
The reason why I will still make this attempt, is that I am upset,
disappointed – well, in fact even afraid [...]."
This is from a recent open letter to FB's Mark Zuckerberg by Espen
Egil Hansen, editor-in-chief of Aftenposten, Norwegian largest daily
newspaper. The context is an article about a chain of events that
Hansen describes as follows:
"A few weeks ago the Norwegian author Tom Egeland posted an entry on
Facebook about, and including, seven photographs that changed the
history of warfare. You in turn removed the picture of a naked Kim
Phuc, fleeing from the napalm bombs – one of the world’s most
famous war photographs.
Tom then rendered Kim Phuc’s criticism against Facebook for banning
her picture. Facebook reacted by excluding Tom and prevented him from
posting a new entry."
Aftenpost article about all of this was, naturally, illustrated
with said picture. Facebook demanded with standard form-letter than
Aftenpost delete the picture and when didn't comply, FB deleted the
entire article after less than a day.
The point I want make is not how the traditional media have become
depended on FB and how this is now going to bite them. That's obvious.
What struck me more was the pithy description of the experience of
living under algorithmic governance: opaque and arbitrary rules, which
produce absurd effects, but, from the point of view of the governing
entity, this much less important than the fact that these rules scale
well. The absurdity of the results comes from the application of the
rules without consideration of the ambiguities and constant negations
that make up daily life and that are, in fact, an important basis
for freedom. If rules aren't acknowledged as unambiguous there is no
legitimate ground for complying with the rules in more than one way.
The second point is the experience of the enormity of the distance
between those who govern and those who are governed. This open letter
is like burning incense in a temple to placate angry gods. And
remember, this how it feels to a bona-fide member of the national
elite in a wealthy country. I presume the other 99.999% of FB users
wouldn't even bother to complain....

heart, bigger than the whole world.  And he was fucking intelligent,
brilliant, wow!  I was always asking to that son of a bitch donate me some
of his neurons, because he never would miss them and I needed much more
than my two neurons, Ceci and Lia, to study more and more and more subjects
and, maybe after some decades, become someone like him...
If I delete that fucking stupid FB account, I will lose for complete the
access to his private profile and his amazing posts, funny pics, his crazy
stories, private conversations, everything, part of his life that still
exists online...  I will lose him twice and I know I won't manage well this
pain.  It still hurts so, so bad after years...
I know it's stupid, but, sometimes, I like to pretend he is still alive,
laughing, telling the most creative stories or the craziest conspiracy
theories, the best jokes, explaining me something completely useless,
stupid and silly, but in a so interesting way that I always would think
"Wow!  God, how could I survive without knowing it until today?"...
I never deleted my dead stupid Orkut account for the same reason, but
because of another dead friend.  He was my best friend for almost 15 years
of my life.  Years of friendship and he decided to kill himself without
saying anything.  No good bye, no I love you.  I just received a very
expensive Edith Piaf's collection few days after his death.  No words to
say 'adieu', only music.  He had lost my favorite Edith Piaf's CD years ago
and before the suicide, he remembered it.
I was beta tester for some Google products that I simply don't use anymore,
but still contain sweet memories.  This Gmail account is really, really
old.  I still remember when received the invite to have it...
Well, more than slave of Facebook and Google, I am slave of my own
memories, of my past.  I already lost so many dear friends, teachers,
heroes and loves and my heart never heals for complete.  I always feel it
completely destroyed after every loss.  I die when someone that I love dies.
It was fucking strange, but when I tried the suicide, I destroyed lots of
important data and things, including notebooks and devices able of being
used against friends and activists, but, in the end, had no courage enough
to delete that stupid FB account forever.  I imagined that some friends
would like to see my old pics smiling on Facebook after my death...
So, probably, I will never be a really good cypherpunk.  And also a good
anarchist, because, in several senses, I am a slave.  Maybe of companies,
maybe of my own past, but not so free and independent as I should be.

Dead people don't think, Mirimir.  Why do you think I tried the suicide?
Just for fun?  I was bored, with lots of free time on my hands, and
thought  "Hey, let's try to discover in person if God, Heaven, Hell,
Saints, angels, all these things really exist?"  :)
Well, almost died twice, in different situations years ago.  In one of
them, in the Intensive Care Unity of the hospital, when I almost gone
forever, it was the only moment when the strong pain stopped.  I did not
see any light, any angel, but felt a deep inner peace.  I felt so much
harmony.  It was like to feel complete again, a so intimate and serene
happiness.  It was warm, cozy, sweet.  Absolute perfection.
You will never know the true.  Nobody will knows. :)
Death.  No pain.  No fear.  No thoughts.  No feelings.  No traums.  No
memories.  No nightmares.  No broken hearts.  No lies.  No masks.  No
labels.  No judgements.  No Injustice.  Simply, pure and absolute No
But, well, there will be still chemical elements and all my Carbon will
become something new.  The beautiful circle of life.  <3
The human being is so contraditory and confused that even writing all these
things, I am seriously "life addicted".  I really love being alive.
Even when I cry and complain about feeling my heart destroyed, I remember a
beautiful music, poetry or thing that still make me feel smile.  There is
so much beauty in the world, my love.  Even when deeply hurt, when feeling
emotional and physical pain, I simply can't ignore so much beauty.  I tried
sometimes, but it's impossible.
And there are so amazing people in the world.  Even when I want to die, it
is impossible to me avoiding to smile when I listen children laughing,
happy, innocent.  Or when I see a happy puppie wagging its tail for me,
asking to play.  Or when I see the blue sea and feel its smell and the wind
playing with my hair.  Or when I think about my family.  I think it is
love, isn't it?

Unending relief: .mil does right thing; just let me be me
Chelsea Manning Told She Will Receive Gender Transition Surgery, Her Lawyer
The military’s decision — which the military will not confirm — follows a
recommendation made by Manning’s psychologist more than five months ago.
Originally posted on September 13, 2016, 22:24 GMT
Updated on September 13, 2016, 23:56 GMT
Chris Geidner
BuzzFeed News Reporter
WASHINGTON — Army officials today informed Chelsea Manning that they will
provide her with gender transition surgery, her lawyer tells BuzzFeed News.
A lawyer for Manning, the ACLU's Chase Strangio, spoke with Manning on
Tuesday after she was informed of the military's decision. Manning, serving
a 35-year prison sentence for violating the Espionage Act, received a
recommendation from her psychologist in April that she receive surgery
related to her gender dysphoria.
“I am unendingly relieved that the military is finally doing the right
thing. I applaud them for that. This is all that I wanted – for them to let
me be me,” Manning said in a statement provided by her lawyers.
"But it is hard not to wonder why it has taken so long. Also, why were such
drastic measures needed? The surgery was recommended back in April 2016.
The recommendations for my hair length were back in 2014," Manning
continued in the statement. "In any case, I hope this sets a precedent for
the thousands of trans people behind me hoping they will be given the
treatment they need."
Strangio said that Manning was told on Tuesday that the military made a
determination that the Department of Defense's instruction for "In-Service
Transition" applies to her. Additionally, according to Strangio, Manning
was shown a treatment plan that included information about surgery and the
medical team necessary to move forward with that surgery.
Strangio added, however, that Manning was told that she must continue to
keep her hair short, as required under male grooming standards, until she
receives the surgery.
Asked to confirm the information provided by Manning's lawyer, Army
spokesperson Wayne Hall told BuzzFeed News only, "We cannot and will not
discuss the medical needs of individuals."
The decision ends a hunger strike that Manning began on Sept. 9, but it
does not, at this point, end a hearing scheduled for Manning on Sept. 20
relating to charges resulting from Manning's suicide attempt earlier this
"Thankfully the government has recognized its constitutional obligation to
provide Chelsea with the medical care that she needs and we hope that they
will act without delay to ensure that her suffering does not needlessly
continue," Strangio said in a statement.
Strangio added, however, that Tuesday's news doesn't alleviate all of the
concerns of Manning's lawyers. First, he said, they will continue to
monitor the situation to see how quickly the military moves forward with
the recommended surgery. Second, Strangio noted, "Certainly, we're going to
move forward with our litigation on the hair issue, as that remains a
matter of concern." Finally, Strangio said it is the hope of Manning's
lawyers that "all charges related to her suicide attempt and the
investigation that followed are dropped."
No prison inmate — at the state or federal level — has received gender
transition surgery. The issue of gender has been highly charged, leading to
extensive litigation even in more traditionally liberal states like
Massachusetts and California. Although a settlement reached in a California
case brought by the Transgender Law Center provided for surgery for Shiloh
Quine, Quine's lawyers told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday that the surgery is
set for this fall but has not yet happened.
Activists opposed to Manning's imprisonment updated an ongoing petition
after the announcement of Tuesday's news, stating, "Chelsea Manning ends
hunger strike after Army agrees to provide her with needed health care. But
they're still threatening to punish her for attempting to take her own

I know it's confuse, because most of people always think about her XY

Yes, you do are a troll.
In your first message on this list, you used the nick "jaun" and asked
about John Young and Cryptome  (thread:  "Cryptome run by feds").  In
another topic  (thread:  "Number of onions online", you mentioned that
"[Tor] is [used 99,9% for] illegal activity and drugs".  And the rest is
for your "honey pot"."
Your first message using the nick "roosty", about Cloudfire, on the thread
"Re: flexthismotherfucker" was not so annoying, you was just provoking.
Your second message using the nick "rooty" was bizarre and aggressive.  You
posted the link for one of
the most bizarre, stupid and racist videos that I saw, on a thread named
Being sincere, I had no stomach for watching this video, named "How Savage
Are Blacks In America & Why Is Everyone Afraid To Discuss It?".  It's
disgusting, nasty, harmful to offend the black people.  Someone who judges
a person for the melanin in their skin doesn't deserve and doesn't have my
"Cypher Piggie" wrote several times the word "nigga", very racist.  You
have the Cypher Piggie from Hell patterns, not me and never John Young.  I
am not a "nigga", troll, I am a "Jap", but offending my black bros is
really to ask for being kicked right in the balls.  Remember it.
Your next thread was "Xorcist = Coderman".  Guy, Xorcist and Coderman are
different persons, with different styles and points of view.  Horrible
bet!  You just offended Xorcist and, if he is still alive and reading the
list, Coderman.
And, finally, this absurd thread "Cypher piggie = JY = sea sea".
Troll, I deeply love, respect and admire John Young,  Architect.  It would
be a honor and a pleasure to be him, even for some minutes.  Only a really
stupid person would link a real cypherpunk like JY with an annoying troll
like Cypher Pig.

---------- Forwarded message ----------

A feminist internet works towards empowering more women and queer
persons – in all our diversities – to fully enjoy our rights, engage in
pleasure and play, and dismantle patriarchy. This integrates our
different realities, contexts and specificities – including age,
disabilities, sexualities, gender identities and expressions,
socioeconomic locations, political and religious beliefs, ethnic
origins, and racial markers. The following key principles are critical
towards realising a feminist internet.
1 Access to the internet
A feminist internet starts with enabling more women and queer persons to
enjoy universal, acceptable, affordable, unconditional, open, meaningful
and equal access to the internet.
2 Access to information
We support and protect unrestricted access to information relevant to
women and queer persons, particularly information on sexual and
reproductive health and rights, pleasure, safe abortion, access to
justice, and LGBTIQ issues. This includes diversity in languages,
abilities, interests and contexts.
3 Usage of technology
Women and queer persons have the right to code, design, adapt and
critically and sustainably use ICTs and reclaim technology as a platform
for creativity and expression, as well aschallenge the cultures of
sexism and discrimination in all spaces.
__Movements & public participation
4 Resistance
The internet is a space where social norms are negotiated, performed and
imposed, often in an extension of other spaces shaped by patriarchy and
heteronormativity. Our struggle for a feminist internet is one that
forms part of a continuum of our resistance in other spaces, public,
private and in-between.
5 Movement building
The internet is a transformative political space. It facilitates new
forms of citizenship that enable individuals to claim, construct and
express selves, genders and sexualities. This includes connecting across
territories, demanding accountability and transparency, and creating
opportunities for sustained feminist movement building.
6 Internet governance
We believe in challenging the patriarchal spaces and processes that
control internet governance, as well as putting more feminists and
queers at the decision-making tables. We want to democratise policy
making affecting the internet as well as diffuse ownership of and power
in global and local networks.
7. Alternative economies
We are committed to interrogating the capitalist logic that drives
technology towards further privatisation, profit and corporate control.
We work to create alternative forms of economic power that are grounded
in principles of cooperation, solidarity, commons, environmental
sustainability, and openness.
8. Free and open source
We are committed to creating and experimenting with technology,
including digital safety and security, and using free/libre and open
source software (FLOSS), tools, and platforms. Promoting, disseminating,
and sharing knowledge about the use of FLOSS is central to our praxis.
9 Amplifying feminist discourse
We claim the power of the internet to amplify women’s narratives and
lived realities. There is a need to resist the state, the religious
right and other extremist forces who monopolise discourses of morality,
while silencing feminist voices and persecuting women’s human rights
10 Freedom of expression
We defend the right to sexual expression as a freedom of expression
issue of no less importance than political or religious expression. We
strongly object to the efforts of state and non-state actors to control,
surveil, regulate and restrict feminist and queer expression on the
Internet through technology, legislation or violence. We recognise this
as part of the larger political project of moral policing, censorship,
and hierarchisation of citizenship and rights.
11 Pornography and “harmful content”
We recognise that the issue of pornography online has to do with agency,
consent, power and labour. We reject simple causal linkages made between
consumption of pornographic content and violence against women. We also
reject the use of the umbrella term “harmful content”label expression on
female and transgender sexuality. We support reclaiming and creating
alternative erotic content that resists the mainstream patriarchal gaze
and locates women and queer persons’ desires at the centre.
12 Consent
We call on the need to build an ethics and politics of consent into the
culture, design, policies and terms of service of internet platforms.
Women’s agency lies in their ability to make informed decisions on what
aspects of their public or private lives to share online.
13 Privacy and data
We support the right to privacy and to full control over personal data
and information online at all levels. We reject practices by states and
private companies to use data for profit and to manipulate behaviour
online. Surveillance is the historical tool of patriarchy, used to
control and restrict women’s bodies, speech and activism. We pay equal
attention to surveillance practices by individuals, the private sector,
the state and non-state actors.
14 Memory
We have the right to exercise and retain control over our personal
history and memory on the internet. This includes being able to access
all our personal data and information online, and to be able to exercise
control over this data, including knowing who has access to it and under
what conditions, and the ability to delete it forever.
15 Anonymity
We defend the right to be anonymous and reject all claims to restrict
anonymity online. Anonymity enables our freedom of expression online,
particularly when it comes to breaking taboos of sexuality and
heteronormativity, experimenting with gender identity, and enabling
safety for women and queer persons affected by discrimination.
16 Children and youth
We call for the inclusion of the voices and experiences of young people
in the decisions made about safety and security online and promote their
safety, privacy, and access to information. We recognise children’s
right to healthy emotional and sexual development, which includes the
right to privacy and access to positive information about sex, gender
and sexuality at critical times in their lives.
17 Online violence
We call on all internet stakeholders, including internet users, policy
makers and the private sector, to address the issue of online harassment
and technology-related violence. The attacks, threats, intimidation and
policing experienced by women and queers are real, harmful and alarming,
and are part of the broader issue of gender-based violence. It is our
collective responsibility to address and end this.

and to spread the creation of their site with fake allegations, using own
Jacob Appelbaum's name.
I love Jake and if you have some doubt about about my loyalty and
friendship, please, ask him.  :)
This thread was something ugly and sad.  We are anarchying a slander and
using this thread to celebrate our joy, to celebrate the cypherpunks list,
a group where Jake always be respected and received as an equal, where he
can find friends and supporters.
I love Jake and always will love.  And fuck who doesn't like it!  :)
Alex, my love, Let's make a new thread telling good things about Jake since
the first message, seeing the life in a not too serious way.  This thread
is full of shit about Jake and it has begin with a slander.  Jake deserves
joy, laugh, smiles, tickles, snugglehugs, cupcakes and our love.
The JA Group deserves laugh too, but because they are a bad joke.  A stupid
lynch mob, which used slanders and lies to erase the joy of Jake's life.
Jake is alive, is a winner and is very happy all the times when one more
lie is finally considered false in public.  I miss the happy Jake,
laughing, smiling and I want to listen to his laugh in public again, maybe
cooking onions with him.  ;)
His life is still a celebration, because he always had a hard life and is a
winner.  Who knows how hard his life was, knows he always will be a
winner.  Jake is someone that I love and I am proud to call "my friend"!
Love, Kisses, Laugh & Orgasms for all of you!!!  <3  <3  <3

Grarpamp is not being pretentious and dramatic.  He is not making personal

It remembers me two sad musics.  Not exactly their rhythms, but their
lyrics are very melancholic and hopeless.
The beggining of "American Pie" is pretty slow and delicate.  I prefer when
the music becomes faster, more beautiful and, at same time, more anguished
and sad.  The Madonna's version is more energetic and dancing, but this
original versional is more nostalgic, more "uncomfortable" for me.
*  American Pie  (Don McLean):  "Born in USA" has a great energy, the powerful voice of Springsteen and a
contagious enthusiasm, but it is not about the joy or the pride of being
North American.  It's a sad song about people trying to live their simple
lives, going to non sense wars, without understand why kill or die, because
of the USA government.  Returning of wars with no support, no dreams, no

"Listen, Mark, this is serious. First you create rules that don’t
distinguish between child pornography and famous war photographs. Then
you practice these rules without allowing space for good judgement.
Finally you even censor criticism against and a discussion about the
decision – and you punish the person who dares to voice criticism.
To be honest, I have no illusions that you will read this letter.
The reason why I will still make this attempt, is that I am upset,
disappointed – well, in fact even afraid [...]."
This is from a recent open letter to FB's Mark Zuckerberg by Espen
Egil Hansen, editor-in-chief of Aftenposten, Norwegian largest daily
newspaper. The context is an article about a chain of events that
Hansen describes as follows:
"A few weeks ago the Norwegian author Tom Egeland posted an entry on
Facebook about, and including, seven photographs that changed the
history of warfare. You in turn removed the picture of a naked Kim
Phuc, fleeing from the napalm bombs – one of the world’s most
famous war photographs.
Tom then rendered Kim Phuc’s criticism against Facebook for banning
her picture. Facebook reacted by excluding Tom and prevented him from
posting a new entry."
Aftenpost article about all of this was, naturally, illustrated
with said picture. Facebook demanded with standard form-letter than
Aftenpost delete the picture and when didn't comply, FB deleted the
entire article after less than a day.
The point I want make is not how the traditional media have become
depended on FB and how this is now going to bite them. That's obvious.
What struck me more was the pithy description of the experience of
living under algorithmic governance: opaque and arbitrary rules, which
produce absurd effects, but, from the point of view of the governing
entity, this much less important than the fact that these rules scale
well. The absurdity of the results comes from the application of the
rules without consideration of the ambiguities and constant negations
that make up daily life and that are, in fact, an important basis
for freedom. If rules aren't acknowledged as unambiguous there is no
legitimate ground for complying with the rules in more than one way.
The second point is the experience of the enormity of the distance
between those who govern and those who are governed. This open letter
is like burning incense in a temple to placate angry gods. And
remember, this how it feels to a bona-fide member of the national
elite in a wealthy country. I presume the other 99.999% of FB users
wouldn't even bother to complain....

[OT, OT, OT]  Answer very, very, very OFF TOPIC about Facebook, but it's
part of a discussion that I already had with Mirimir and some friends here
I have an old account on Facebook that I used to keep only to read private
invitations on groups of Hackerspaces, Law and  - hahaha!!! -  Internet
Privacy, all owned and managed for friends.  I am not using it anymore, but
I simply do not have courage enough to delete it forever.  Tried before and
gave up because of old sweet memories, very important for me.
There are two dead friends among my contacts.  One of them was so special
for me that you never will understand, my dear.  He was one of the fnords
of my life.  He was one of the best hackers that I've knowed and had a huge
heart, bigger than the whole world.  And he was fucking intelligent,
brilliant, wow!  I was always asking to that son of a bitch donate me some
of his neurons, because he never would miss them and I needed much more
than my two neurons, Ceci and Lia, to study more and more and more subjects
and, maybe after some decades, become someone like him...
If I delete that fucking stupid FB account, I will lose for complete the
access to his private profile and his amazing posts, funny pics, his crazy
stories, private conversations, everything, part of his life that still
exists online...  I will lose him twice and I know I won't manage well this
pain.  It still hurts so, so bad after years...
I know it's stupid, but, sometimes, I like to pretend he is still alive,
laughing, telling the most creative stories or the craziest conspiracy
theories, the best jokes, explaining me something completely useless,
stupid and silly, but in a so interesting way that I always would think
"Wow!  God, how could I survive without knowing it until today?"...
I never deleted my dead stupid Orkut account for the same reason, but
because of another dead friend.  He was my best friend for almost 15 years
of my life.  Years of friendship and he decided to kill himself without
saying anything.  No good bye, no I love you.  I just received a very
expensive Edith Piaf's collection few days after his death.  No words to
say 'adieu', only music.  He had lost my favorite Edith Piaf's CD years ago
and before the suicide, he remembered it.
I was beta tester for some Google products that I simply don't use anymore,
but still contain sweet memories.  This Gmail account is really, really
old.  I still remember when received the invite to have it...
Well, more than slave of Facebook and Google, I am slave of my own
memories, of my past.  I already lost so many dear friends, teachers,
heroes and loves and my heart never heals for complete.  I always feel it
completely destroyed after every loss.  I die when someone that I love dies.
It was fucking strange, but when I tried the suicide, I destroyed lots of
important data and things, including notebooks and devices able of being
used against friends and activists, but, in the end, had no courage enough
to delete that stupid FB account forever.  I imagined that some friends
would like to see my old pics smiling on Facebook after my death...
So, probably, I will never be a really good cypherpunk.  And also a good
anarchist, because, in several senses, I am a slave.  Maybe of companies,
maybe of my own past, but not so free and independent as I should be.

Dead people don't think, Mirimir.  Why do you think I tried the suicide?
Just for fun?  I was bored, with lots of free time on my hands, and
thought  "Hey, let's try to discover in person if God, Heaven, Hell,
Saints, angels, all these things really exist?"  :)
Well, almost died twice, in different situations years ago.  In one of
them, in the Intensive Care Unity of the hospital, when I almost gone
forever, it was the only moment when the strong pain stopped.  I did not
see any light, any angel, but felt a deep inner peace.  I felt so much

happiness.  It was warm, cozy, sweet.  Absolute perfection.

The human being is so contraditory and confused that even writing all these
things, I am seriously "life addicted".  I really love being alive.
Even when I cry and complain about feeling my heart destroyed, I remember a
beautiful music, poetry or thing that still make me feel smile.  There is
so much beauty in the world, my love.  Even when deeply hurt, when feeling
emotional and physical pain, I simply can't ignore so much beauty.  I tried
sometimes, but it's impossible.
And there are so amazing people in the world.  Even when I want to die, it
is impossible to me avoiding to smile when I listen children laughing,
happy, innocent.  Or when I see a happy puppie wagging its tail for me,
asking to play.  Or when I see the blue sea and feel its smell and the wind
playing with my hair.  Or when I think about my family.  I think it is
love, isn't it?

Unending relief: .mil does right thing; just let me be me
Chelsea Manning Told She Will Receive Gender Transition Surgery, Her Lawyer
The military’s decision — which the military will not confirm — follows a
recommendation made by Manning’s psychologist more than five months ago.
Originally posted on September 13, 2016, 22:24 GMT
Updated on September 13, 2016, 23:56 GMT
Chris Geidner
BuzzFeed News Reporter
WASHINGTON — Army officials today informed Chelsea Manning that they will
provide her with gender transition surgery, her lawyer tells BuzzFeed News.
A lawyer for Manning, the ACLU's Chase Strangio, spoke with Manning on
Tuesday after she was informed of the military's decision. Manning, serving
a 35-year prison sentence for violating the Espionage Act, received a
recommendation from her psychologist in April that she receive surgery
related to her gender dysphoria.
“I am unendingly relieved that the military is finally doing the right
thing. I applaud them for that. This is all that I wanted – for them to let
me be me,” Manning said in a statement provided by her lawyers.
"But it is hard not to wonder why it has taken so long. Also, why were such
drastic measures needed? The surgery was recommended back in April 2016.
The recommendations for my hair length were back in 2014," Manning
continued in the statement. "In any case, I hope this sets a precedent for
the thousands of trans people behind me hoping they will be given the
treatment they need."
Strangio said that Manning was told on Tuesday that the military made a
determination that the Department of Defense's instruction for "In-Service
Transition" applies to her. Additionally, according to Strangio, Manning
was shown a treatment plan that included information about surgery and the
medical team necessary to move forward with that surgery.
Strangio added, however, that Manning was told that she must continue to
keep her hair short, as required under male grooming standards, until she
receives the surgery.
Asked to confirm the information provided by Manning's lawyer, Army
spokesperson Wayne Hall told BuzzFeed News only, "We cannot and will not
discuss the medical needs of individuals."
The decision ends a hunger strike that Manning began on Sept. 9, but it
does not, at this point, end a hearing scheduled for Manning on Sept. 20
relating to charges resulting from Manning's suicide attempt earlier this
"Thankfully the government has recognized its constitutional obligation to
provide Chelsea with the medical care that she needs and we hope that they
will act without delay to ensure that her suffering does not needlessly
continue," Strangio said in a statement.
Strangio added, however, that Tuesday's news doesn't alleviate all of the
concerns of Manning's lawyers. First, he said, they will continue to
monitor the situation to see how quickly the military moves forward with
the recommended surgery. Second, Strangio noted, "Certainly, we're going to
move forward with our litigation on the hair issue, as that remains a
matter of concern." Finally, Strangio said it is the hope of Manning's
lawyers that "all charges related to her suicide attempt and the
investigation that followed are dropped."
No prison inmate — at the state or federal level — has received gender
transition surgery. The issue of gender has been highly charged, leading to
extensive litigation even in more traditionally liberal states like
Massachusetts and California. Although a settlement reached in a California
case brought by the Transgender Law Center provided for surgery for Shiloh
Quine, Quine's lawyers told BuzzFeed News on Tuesday that the surgery is
set for this fall but has not yet happened.
Activists opposed to Manning's imprisonment updated an ongoing petition
after the announcement of Tuesday's news, stating, "Chelsea Manning ends
hunger strike after Army agrees to provide her with needed health care. But
they're still threatening to punish her for attempting to take her own

Yes, you do are a troll.
In your first message on this list, you used the nick "jaun" and asked
about John Young and Cryptome  (thread:  "Cryptome run by feds").  In
another topic  (thread:  "Number of onions online", you mentioned that
"[Tor] is [used 99,9% for] illegal activity and drugs".  And the rest is
for your "honey pot"."
Your first message using the nick "roosty", about Cloudfire, on the thread
"Re: flexthismotherfucker" was not so annoying, you was just provoking.
Your second message using the nick "rooty" was bizarre and aggressive.  You
posted the link for one of
the most bizarre, stupid and racist videos that I saw, on a thread named
Being sincere, I had no stomach for watching this video, named "How Savage
Are Blacks In America & Why Is Everyone Afraid To Discuss It?".  It's

a person for the melanin in their skin doesn't deserve and doesn't have my
"Cypher Piggie" wrote several times the word "nigga", very racist.  You
have the Cypher Piggie from Hell patterns, not me and never John Young.  I
am not a "nigga", troll, I am a "Jap", but offending my black bros is
really to ask for being kicked right in the balls.  Remember it.
Your next thread was "Xorcist = Coderman".  Guy, Xorcist and Coderman are
different persons, with different styles and points of view.  Horrible
bet!  You just offended Xorcist and, if he is still alive and reading the
list, Coderman.
And, finally, this absurd thread "Cypher piggie = JY = sea sea".
Troll, I deeply love, respect and admire John Young,  Architect.  It would
be a honor and a pleasure to be him, even for some minutes.  Only a really
stupid person would link a real cypherpunk like JY with an annoying troll

a place for sharing Anti-Semitic videos or any kind of racist

I was kick-banned there under the allegation of "rape apology", even

this nazi too.  Or is "nazism apology" more acceptable in the list

Kisses, hugs and tickles!  <3
(A) CyberClassWar Manifesto 2017 (A)
First and foremost we are anarchists.
The world is split into two camps: the working class and the ruling class.
We the workers will wage a class war against the ruling class and the
social order, and bring to birth a new world from the ashes of the old.
We seek to destroy capitalism, the state, and all forms of hierarchy
such as racism, patriarchy, abelism, homophobia and transphobia.
In turn we seek to create a united world, free of borders and nationality,
where all people live united by solidarity and love for their
fellow human being. We shall know no domination, no hierarchy, no
We shall abolish wage labor and have workers' self-management.
Surely there will be mistakes, and surely there will be problems, but
the world will be incomparably better than how it exists today.
We do not see this vision as some pipedream distant utopia, but
rather as the only viable option for the survival of humanity. Climate
and environmental degradation have ravaged our planet to a horrific degree,
so we must act for the sake of the future.
Make no mistake, we do not believe in a vanguard. The liberation of the
working class must be the work of the working class itself. A small portion
of the working class cannot stand as a representative for the rest of us.
We do however believe that CyberClassWar can be used as a weapon against
the ruling class.
But what exactly is CyberClassWar? It is merely the practice of using the
tactics of cyberwarfare to advance the aims of the working class.
Instead of limiting ourselves to the workplace, community, and home,
we are upgrading our strategy to the information age so as to encompass the
virtual realm. We live out an increasing portion of our lives in the place
known as the internet, so why not extend the fight. Hacktivism already
but it hasn't been leveraged to the full degree it could.
We will not go into detail, but we shall say that we want do expropriative
via the digital realm.

off yet, he is probably the single biggest piss-off on this piss-off list.
above drivel, why not lend your thoughts to various subjects of this list
in your free time.
Dear Abhayraj,
Please, don't feel annoyed about grarpamp's words.  He just wants to make
much better, higher the level of this list, make it more rational and
constructive.  More Abhayraj, less ZeNazi, do you understand?  :D
But, yep, Razer is correct about lurking.  It's your right, whether you
really want it.  Lurking is pretty comfortable and you can eat popcorn and
peanuts while reading all the dramatic messages here, hihi...  Better than
soap opera in the best moments!  :)
I am late in zillions of lists and need to thank a lot for dozens of
heartwarming private messages, but cypherpunks is the only list where I can
mention exotic subjects like Buddhist and Marijuana crypto coins, hahaha!!
 ;D
It makes me feel comfortable here and there are people on this list that I
love more than ice-cream.  You will learn to appreciate a lot some of the
members too.  All of them have their stories, backgrounds, conspiracy
theories, and studies.  Garbage fire people like ZeNazi are the exception
here, not the rule.  Most of the people here are really nice, I swear!  :D
Hugs, take care!

Some weeks ago, I had a very hard conversation with some friends and I
decided to avoid and/or boycott all the events with sexist or unfair
codes of conduct.  Good sense and conversation should be enough among
rational people.  We do not need hundreds of rules.  It's ridiculous
to prejudge someone because of their gender, race, sexual choice,
Well, I became a kind of "case" for being the first girl of the Human
Sciences Area to become a co-founder and a member of the PyLadies in
my country.  After a lot of discussions, I left my own group,
considered actually the biggest Brazilian female coding group, because
of the prejudice of some members (cis women) against men and trans
They seem to hate any human being with a penis and some of them say
that feel very "uncomfortable" with trans women "because they are not
like us".  I did sincerely reject it with all my heart.  They are
using their vaginas like weapons to justify making the same kind of
discrimination and violent attacks that we used to suffer in the past.
We have vaginas, but we are not victims and now it's time for talking
about technology and stop with all the drama.
Shit, I want more and more women talking about technology, not anymore
about how hard is to be a woman talking about tech, how hard is being
a woman, the eternal non-stop victimism.  Yes, we still have victims,
but we also need to show some work instead of only drama.  God, it is
not impossible or so hard!  We just need a bit more of good-will and
I was and I am still the moderator of the PyLadies and Django Girls
Brazilian lists, but we had a horrible discussion about the fact I
always approve male confirmed collaborators, which I've known in
person.  They are helping the groups, so they deserve the chance of
giving their opinions and feedbacks about important subjects, like our
meetings.  I don't know if Freud can explain it, but some of these
women are mean, selfish, and just want fame, become known in the tech
area, and seem to see men like stronger candidates for the same jobs
and talks.
Last week, some evil women very, very limited and stupid wanted
to punish a girl who tweeted a post only because it was written by a
man.  Can you believe it?  It was so ridiculous, so surreal, that I
decided to become more present in the discussions and a little bit
more "savage".  My English stinks, but my Portuguese is precise and

Sorry for disappointing you so much, my dear Juan.  It would be a

the most of my Jewish male single friends are pretty far from me,
living in the USA.  So I think it would be much easier to me choosing
between fucking an Atheist or fucking a Catholic.  Some special
preference, dear?  hahaha!!!  ;D
God, I swear I do still not understand why the heck you hate so much
the Jewish people, Juan!  It's their religion, their faith, and should
be respected as any other, my dear.
You would like to study some of the Jewish principles, Juan.  They
remember me a lot some of the most important Japanese beliefs:  -
Protect your people, your family, your honor.  Respect the wiseness of
the older ones and teach the younger ones how to be good persons,
trying to keep pure their hearts and souls.  Study all the days of
your life, never stop studying.  Respect and honor your parents and
your family's traditions.  Respect your wife/husband and your eventual
sons and daughters.  They will be your blood and flesh and you will
live in their lives, even when your bones become dust and your name
becomes a pretty far memory.  Don't be lazy or selfish.  Be grateful
for being alive and keep surviving.  Always keep surviving to preserve
your proud people's History alive, even after wars, holocausts, and
nuclear bombs, my dear.

Technically, I am an Atheist, Juan.  I've lost my faith in some point
of my life and I know there will not be a return, but I still pray all
the days to a God that I don't know if exists or not, asking to
protect this world and all the people, in special my loved ones.  I
don't do it for simple habit or hypocrisy, but because I really would
like to believe that there is something, someone much bigger than us,
than my dreams, than the whole universe, watching for us with some
tenderness, with compassion and love...  :'(
We never meet each other, but we both are made of atoms.  The atoms of
the sunflower that I am touching now could contain some old atoms of
your skin.  Or Tesla's, maybe.  Who knows?  Maybe God exists only in
the Science, when Chemistry makes its magic, being used to create and
recreate biological and chemical structures.  In any case, almost all
the religions deserve my respect, after analyzing some details.
Well, until a few years ago, a North-American State had a very old law
permitting to shoot in Mormons.  When I read it, I became horrified
with the religious discrimination, but a friend asked me to read about
the Mormons' beliefs before giving any opinion...  Well, I still
considered the law pretty unfair, but I simply could not accept all
those stupid stories as a formal religion.  But also all the other
religions that I studied have very contradictory and surreal facts and
acts, so I try to respect all of them, trying to get what they have of
good to offer, to teach me, and rejecting what doesn't seem logical
for me.  This year, I helped two different religions/churches with the
donations of Christmas gifts for poor children in orphanages and for
old people left alone for their own families in retirement homes.  The
past and the future of my country.  Two different churches, but I
don't follow any religion.  I just wanted a bit fairer world, less
sad, less miserable, at least for one single day of my life, of their
I am *not* a good example of the Japanese culture and I would *never*
be pretentious enough to affirm something different, Juan.  I know I
will always be considered a "gaijin" in the land of my ancestors, even
moving to there and presenting all my Japanese documentation.  My
blood is Japanese, but not my way of thinking, living, moving,
talking, feeling, or making things, and being very sincere, I do *not*
care about it.  I am exactly who I could be and I am following my own
way, still trying to be who I should be.

"Schlafe, mein Prinzchen, schlaf ein" - Rita Streich
Schlafe, mein Prinzchen, schlaf ein,
Schäfchen ruh'n und Vögelein,
Garten und Wiese verstummt,
auch nicht ein Bienchen mehr summt,
Luna mit silbernem Schein
gucket zum Fenster herein,
schlafe bei silbernem Schein,
schlafe, mein Prinzchen, schlaf ein,
schlaf ein, schlaf ein!
Auch in dem Schlosse schon liegt
alles in Schlummer gewiegt,
reget kein Mäuschen sich mehr,
Keller und Küche sind leer,
nur in der Zofe Gemach
tönet ein schmachtendes Ach!
Was für ein Ach mag das sein?
Schlafe, mein Prinzchen, schlaf ein,
schlaf ein, schlaf ein!
Wer ist beglückter als du?
Nichts als Vergnügen und Ruh'!
Spielwerk und Zucker vollauf
und noch Karossen im Lauf,
Alles besorgt und bereit,
dass nur mein Prinzchen nicht schreit.
Was wird da künftig erst sein?
Schlafe, mein Prinzchen, schlaf' ein,
schlaf ein, schlaf ein!
#  English Version
Sleep, my little prince, sleep,
The sheep and the birdies rest,
The garden and the meadow are quiet,
Not even a little bee buzzes anymore.
Luna, with a silverly glow
Looks in through the window,
Sleep by the silvery glow,
Sleep, my little prince, sleep,
Sleep, sleep!
By now, all are in bed in the castle,
All lulled into a slumber,
No more mice stir,
The basement and kitchen are empty.
Only in the maid's chambers
There sounds a languishing sigh!
What might this sigh be for?
Sleep, my little prince, sleep,
Sleep, sleep!
Who is happier than you?
Nothing but pleasure and peace!
All trinkets and sugar,
And a trotting stage-coach.
Everyone's anxious and ready
That my little prince will just not cry.
But what will the future bring?
Sleep, my little prince, sleep,
Sleep, sleep!

No, it isn't a Christmas song, sorry.  I was informed only today about
one of the members of the CypherPunks list's death and it's still
hurting a lot.  He was an amazing guy, so sweet and intelligent, so
young and full of dreams, and I've lost the chance of hugging him at
least once and say hello...  and goodbye too...
I do still not know if there is a God or not, but I really wanted to
believe that my friend is well now, with no pain or sadness, feeling
cozy, protected and loved.  I don't know about other lives, possible
karmas, and reincarnations, Heaven, Purgatory, and Hell, but in any
case, always there will be the atoms and the Chemistry to comfort me
without judgements or any kind of social hypocrisy...
My sadness is not a 'lack of faith' as some religious people say, but
simply what I am feeling now.  I am missing a dear friend, who will
never contact me again...  :'(

There's an emptiness tonight
A hole that wasn't there before
And I keep reaching for the light
But I can't find it anymore
There's an emptiness tonight
A heavy hand that pulls me down
They say it's gonna be alright
But can't begin to tell me how
And I ask myself out loud
Have I been lost all along?
Was there something I could say or something I should not have done?
Was I lost all along?

Is there sunshine where you are?
The way there was when you were here
'Cause I'm just sitting in the dark
In disbelief that this is real
In disbelief that this is real
Have I been lost all along?
Was there something I could say or something I should not have done?
Was I lost all along?

And I ask myself out loud

Holy shit, this is still going on. This is one of the reasons I
blocked James "Jim" Donald so long ago. The other is that he is complete
human garbage.
+ 1.  I blocked James several months ago, never regretting my decision,
It's really sad and very contradictory watching this kind of evil and
harmful people always mentioning God, Jesus and the Bible.  Hypocrites like
them deserve a special place on Hell.
If God really exists, They are pure, sincere love and absolute compassion,
never cruelty, any kind of prejudice, racism, intolerance, hate...
We are all Their sons and daughters, and we all received the gift of life
the same way.  We all are brothers and sisters, and we should make our best
for our family.
It's extremely wrong and unethical spreading so intolerant and hateful
ideas, using the Bible  - never a trustful source of "information" -  or
supposed "scientific" researches to "prove" the inferiority of other races
or genders.
I am deeply sad because good, kind and brave people are dying all the
single days...  And, unfortunately, real garbage fire people like Donald
Trump, KKK's and NAMBLA's members, Zenaan Harkness and James Donald, among
several others, are still alive, telling nasty lies, being cruel and
disgusting, destroying and hurting the people, the good feelings that still
remains in this world...

My dearest Juan,
If I want to be an Atheist, a Shinto, a Jew, a Christian, or whatever, is
my problem.  It's my opinion, my faith, my personal belief.
So, if I want to believe in a hypothetical God full of love and compassion,
the problem is mine.  Only mine, Juan.
I do have the right of imagining how would be God if They exist.  I know I
can be completely wrong about Their kindness and compassion, but...
well...  so what?  Who does care about my religious opinion?  Certainly,
not you.  :)
And already read the Bible sometimes.  It's very confused and
contradictory.  A horrible fiction book.
Take care, my dear, and eat lots of chocolate with urgency, please.  I love
you, but your bad mood is really annoying in some moments, aff...  :P

Says she while enthusiastically calling for the murder of Christians,
whites, and males.
My dear garbage fire brother,
Please, do *not* take my words of its context and stop telling daily lies.
Jeez, is it not a sin in your religion?  It's really disgusting!  :(((
I would *never* ask for any murder.  Why the heck do you think I am a
veggie since my earlier years?  Because I was a hipster, being veggie
before it becomes hype, very cool?  Hahahaha!!!  ;D
I do *not* support any death.  And, sorry, if you were not informed about
it, the life of cows, pigs, chickens, cats, dogs, koalas, and several other
animals, is *not* more important than *any human life*, including yours.
But I confess that, technically, I don't include you among the rational
beings.  Already met doggies much smarter than you.  And they were cuter
and less boring too!  :D
I do not know if there is a Hell or not, my detestable garbage fire
brother, but in positive case, we will meet there someday and, remember,
you will arrive first.  You are much older and hated than me, so the
probabilities are better on my side, hahaha!!    ;)
I hope your atoms can be used in a better way, like beautiful flowers and
trees.  James, you are a bad seed, a rotten apple in the society, spreading
hate and intolerance.  You are the broken potato chip in the package, the
one that always makes a mess and is wasted, aff...  :(((
Ah, my dear, remember that I am being banned and excluded in some feminist
radical groups for defending equality of treatment of women and men, for
really believing that intelligence and character are much more important
than genders, races, religions, sexual options, whatever...
I will always try to respect all the people, but illogical, heartless
racist, sexist, and homophobic garbage fire people like you do *not*
deserve my respect and my time.
I am deeply sorry for disappointing you, but instead of "enthusiastically
calling for the murder of Christians, whites, and males", I do prefer to
mourn the recent deaths of my friends and think about the future, about our
lost plans and dreams.
All the three were "Christian white males", but it doesn't matter.  What is
really important, what is making me cry for their deaths, is the fact that
all the three were lovely, very kind, amazing human beings, always trying
to share their knowledge and helping other people.  I will miss them until
the last of my days.
Who will cry for your death, James?  Who will miss you?  Nobody.
Bye bye, baby!  See you in Hell or maybe in another reincarnation.  It's
also a possibility to be strongly considered, because Zenaan and you are
the living proofs of the existence of other lives.  Nobody can become so
odious, hateful, and stupid in one single human life.  It takes muuuch
time...  :P

Social Justice Warriors always project.  I hear the voice of a woman who
has cats instead of children.
When you die, no one will notice, and your cats will eat you.
I have children, I have grandchildren.  You think you have friends, but
observe how progressives treat their "friends".
When progs die, their cats eat them.
Oh, dear...  Are you hearing the voice of a woman who has cats instead of
children?  Are you sure?  Another time, like you mentioned a semester ago
and also last year?  :((
So you are listening really bad and/or imagining things, my poor old
James...  Tsk, tsk...  Evident signals of dementia.  :-/
Well, in your age, becoming senile and mixing facts, sounds, and memories
is very natural, but I sincerely recommend you to search for some good
medical care in 2018, if you can pay for it, of course.
Good psychiatrists and otolaryngologists  (ENT doctors)  are really
expensive in your country.  Trump f_cked the healthcare pretty well in only
one year, didn't he?  ;)
I do *not* have cats or any pets and already wrote it so many times here
that even a senile old man like you could remember.  And already said
several times why are my reasons for not having children.  It was my
personal choice and I will never regret it, even loving very, very much
children and my never born daughters and sons...  I want to protect them of
people like you, Zenaan, Trump, of this unfair world, full of hate and
stupid prejudices...  <\3
Well, in any case, did you already try DNA exams?  Considering your
"fascinating personality", I bet your children can easily being postman's
and milkman's kids, hihihi...  :)
Well, anyway, having children and grandchildren means absolutely nothing,
James.  N-O-T-H-I-N-G, do you understand?  No real warranty of mourning,
drama, and tears.
Why do you think they will miss you?  Or will sincerely cry for your
death?  These are a few of all the probabilities to be considered, if you
have at least one single active neuron, James.  Too hard for you?  Oh, poor
old man!  Let me help you with very simple explanations, something nearby
to your intellectual level...  :)
They probably hate you and/or feel deeply ashamed of being related to
someone so odious, bitter, and cruel like you, that always writes hateful
texts, full of all kinds of stupid prejudices, and, all the semesters,
tries to hurt me mentioning exactly the same things...  Aff, you are so
repetitive that it probably is an obvious signal of Alzheimer's disease...
You always say you have children and grandchildren  (I will only believe
after receiving all the DNA exams results, haha!!)  and that I will be
eaten by my inexistent cats because nobody will notice my death, blah,
blah...  So f_cking what?  Why do you think it will hurt me, stupid and
limited creature?  :-/
I know it's very hard for you, but simply consider the obvious:  - I do not
care about your opinion.  I do not respect you.  I do not care about your
life or your death, about what you had or have, about what you did or do.
You means nothing for me.
And just to register it another time, I do not fear my own death.  I do
really not care about my ending.  What I fear, what hurts my heart and soul
are my loved ones' deaths, their pains...  Loving is much more important
than living, even for people like me.
I have different grades of love and friendship.  Always had, but only this
year, I finally learned to make the distinction between real friends and
those "friends" who just remember my existence when need a lawyer, my
contacts, or my knowledge about some non-public data, meetings, and
Some weeks ago, I was the only person in a group of religious studies to
accept the hypothesis of dying in that exact moment.  Already had a
gorgeous life, true love, and true friends...  Much music, all kind of
readings and people crossed my way, and my life was very fun and
interesting for myself.  Full of unexpected dramas, certainly, but I had
much more joys and sincere happiness than most of the humanity already had
and I sincerely thank the Universe, or maybe God, for this beautiful life.
I really prefer to die just right now than walking to the East of Eden for
all the eternity, never meeting the death, my own end.  It's cruel and I
cannot believe in a cruel God.  You always say you are "Christian".  OK,
which is your Christian Church, James?  There are hundreds of them in the
whole world...  :P

        Interestingly enough I couldn't find a torrent  but here's a

                        The film is so so and the men in it are retarded but what's
        great of course is that the author is intellectualy honest,
        realized what sort of garbage 'feminism' is, and had the courage
        to speak up.
        I would love to know why the US military has decided to ramp up
        their feminazi propaganda in the last two years or so. Have
        you guys ever heard about jacob appelbaum and the tor project?
        It's interesting how people in this list never mention what
        happened to appelbaum and how the feminists run the tor
        project? Cecilia? Got any info on the topic?
Please, Juan, let Jake in peace.  He is studying, working, and still
fighting against nightmares and unfair sexist allegations, some of them, no
more than shameful lies.
In this exact moment, my head is exploding with a hardcore migraine, so I
will watch the movie and give my opinion later, sorry.
What I can do to make clear my point of view about some subjects is to

Hi, my dearest  !  Hope you are
feeling better today, more
hopeful and happy.  It's a holiday in my city, is raining, and I love
you!  <3
Some weeks ago, I had a very hard conversation with some friends and I
decided to avoid and/or boycott all the events with sexist or unfair
codes of conduct.  Good sense and conversation should be enough among
rational people.  We do not need hundreds of rules.  It's ridiculous
to prejudge someone because of their gender, race, sexual choice,
Well, I became a kind of "case" for being the first girl of the Human
Sciences Area to become a co-founder and a member of the PyLadies in
my country.  After a lot of discussions, I left my own group,
considered actually the biggest Brazilian female coding group, because
of the prejudice of some members (cis women) against men and trans
They seem to hate any human being with a penis and some of them say
that feel very "uncomfortable" with trans women "because they are not
like us".  I did sincerely reject it with all my heart.  They are
using their vaginas like weapons to justify making the same kind of
discrimination and violent attacks that we used to suffer in the past.
We have vaginas, but we are not victims and now it's time for talking
about technology and stop with all the drama.
Shit, I want more and more women talking about technology, not anymore
about how hard is to be a woman talking about tech, how hard is being
a woman, the eternal non-stop victimism.  Yes, we still have victims,
but we also need to show some work instead of only drama.  God, it is
not impossible or so hard!  We just need a bit more of good-will and
I was and I am still the moderator of the PyLadies and Django Girls
Brazilian lists, but we had a horrible discussion about the fact I
always approve male confirmed collaborators, which I've known in
person.  They are helping the groups, so they deserve the chance of
giving their opinions and feedbacks about important subjects, like our
meetings.  I don't know if Freud can explain it, but some of these
women are mean, selfish, and just want fame, become known in the tech
area, and seem to see men like stronger candidates for the same jobs
and talks.
Last week, some evil women very, very limited and stupid wanted
to punish a girl who tweeted a post only because it was written by a
man.  Can you believe it?  It was so ridiculous, so surreal, that I
decided to become more present in the discussions and a little bit
more "savage".  My English stinks, but my Portuguese is precise and
very good, so I can present several rational arguments and...  well...
you can imagine the drama, uff...
I am very unhappy too, my dear.  And I am a cute hetero cis woman, "a
poor victim".  :((

I read an old joke and I should not laugh, but I did it.  ;P
"My friend said I make him feel uncomfortable because I violate his
personal space. I was hurt. He completely ruined our bath."
Oh, I forgot to say I don't tweet using the PyLadies account.  Only
three girls do it and I personally appreciate a lot two of them, more
rational and mature than the others.  The "fucking horrible tweet" was
a post about Turing written by a man.  The retard who made a scandal
and sent us a message saying "we are sharing a post written by a man
about another man" was particularly aggressive.
God, I love Turing and my heart always breaks when I think about his
sad history...  And the PyLadies account should be used to share
interesting news and posts about technology, not only Python news and
just women's posts.  It's sexism, feminazism, and I reject this.  Fuck
all the rules that they want to put in one more Conduct Code.  I
respect human beings because of their knowledge, their character, not
because of their genitals.
I love you, dear.  Take care and be happy, please.

Deeply sorry for top posting and not snipping the previous messages, but it
will give a painful background about what is happening in different
countries with some women.
Sorry, I am not a victim.  I am a proud woman and I do love it.  Your
gender doesn't define your character and ethics.  You do it with your acts
and words.

        Interestingly enough I couldn't find a torrent  but here's a
        copy with spanish subtitles.
                        The film is so so and the men in it are retarded but what's
        great of course is that the author is intellectualy honest,
        realized what sort of garbage 'feminism' is, and had the courage
        to speak up.
        I would love to know why the US military has decided to ramp up
        their feminazi propaganda in the last two years or so. Have
        you guys ever heard about jacob appelbaum and the tor project?
        It's interesting how people in this list never mention what
        happened to appelbaum and how the feminists run the tor
        project? Cecilia? Got any info on the topic?
Please, Juan, let Jake in peace.  He is studying, working, and still
fighting against nightmares and unfair sexist allegations, some of them, no
more than shameful lies.
In this exact moment, my head is exploding with a hardcore migraine, so I
will watch the movie and give my opinion later, sorry.
What I can do to make clear my point of view about some subjects is to
paste two of my private emails, both sent in the last week to a person that
I deeply love and trust with my whole heart.
I know I will be more hated than usual, but it doesn't care.  I am being
absolutely sincere.

Hi, my dearest  !  Hope you are
feeling better today, more
hopeful and happy.  It's a holiday in my city, is raining, and I love
you!  <3
Some weeks ago, I had a very hard conversation with some friends and I
decided to avoid and/or boycott all the events with sexist or unfair
codes of conduct.  Good sense and conversation should be enough among
rational people.  We do not need hundreds of rules.  It's ridiculous
to prejudge someone because of their gender, race, sexual choice,
Well, I became a kind of "case" for being the first girl of the Human
Sciences Area to become a co-founder and a member of the PyLadies in
my country.  After a lot of discussions, I left my own group,
considered actually the biggest Brazilian female coding group, because
of the prejudice of some members (cis women) against men and trans
They seem to hate any human being with a penis and some of them say
that feel very "uncomfortable" with trans women "because they are not
like us".  I did sincerely reject it with all my heart.  They are
using their vaginas like weapons to justify making the same kind of
discrimination and violent attacks that we used to suffer in the past.
We have vaginas, but we are not victims and now it's time for talking
about technology and stop with all the drama.
Shit, I want more and more women talking about technology, not anymore
about how hard is to be a woman talking about tech, how hard is being
a woman, the eternal non-stop victimism.  Yes, we still have victims,
but we also need to show some work instead of only drama.  God, it is
not impossible or so hard!  We just need a bit more of good-will and
I was and I am still the moderator of the PyLadies and Django Girls
Brazilian lists, but we had a horrible discussion about the fact I
always approve male confirmed collaborators, which I've known in
person.  They are helping the groups, so they deserve the chance of
giving their opinions and feedbacks about important subjects, like our
meetings.  I don't know if Freud can explain it, but some of these
women are mean, selfish, and just want fame, become known in the tech
area, and seem to see men like stronger candidates for the same jobs
and talks.
Last week, some evil women very, very limited and stupid wanted
to punish a girl who tweeted a post only because it was written by a
man.  Can you believe it?  It was so ridiculous, so surreal, that I
decided to become more present in the discussions and a little bit
more "savage".  My English stinks, but my Portuguese is precise and
very good, so I can present several rational arguments and...  well...
you can imagine the drama, uff...
I am very unhappy too, my dear.  And I am a cute hetero cis woman, "a
poor victim".  :((
Little kisses, hot chocolate and cozy snugglehugs!  <3

I read an old joke and I should not laugh, but I did it.  ;P
"My friend said I make him feel uncomfortable because I violate his
personal space. I was hurt. He completely ruined our bath."
Oh, I forgot to say I don't tweet using the PyLadies account.  Only
three girls do it and I personally appreciate a lot two of them, more
rational and mature than the others.  The "fucking horrible tweet" was
a post about Turing written by a man.  The retard who made a scandal
and sent us a message saying "we are sharing a post written by a man
about another man" was particularly aggressive.
God, I love Turing and my heart always breaks when I think about his
sad history...  And the PyLadies account should be used to share
interesting news and posts about technology, not only Python news and
just women's posts.  It's sexism, feminazism, and I reject this.  Fuck
all the rules that they want to put in one more Conduct Code.  I
respect human beings because of their knowledge, their character, not
because of their genitals.
I love you, dear.  Take care and be happy, please.

Sorry for disappointing you so much, my dear Juan.  It would be a
gorgeous thing to do today, but Rayzer, my Jewish ex-boyfriend, and
the most of my Jewish male single friends are pretty far from me,
living in the USA.  So I think it would be much easier to me choosing
between fucking an Atheist or fucking a Catholic.  Some special
preference, dear?  hahaha!!!  ;D
God, I swear I do still not understand why the heck you hate so much
the Jewish people, Juan!  It's their religion, their faith, and should
be respected as any other, my dear.
You would like to study some of the Jewish principles, Juan.  They
remember me a lot some of the most important Japanese beliefs:  -
Protect your people, your family, your honor.  Respect the wiseness of
the older ones and teach the younger ones how to be good persons,
trying to keep pure their hearts and souls.  Study all the days of
your life, never stop studying.  Respect and honor your parents and
your family's traditions.  Respect your wife/husband and your eventual
sons and daughters.  They will be your blood and flesh and you will
live in their lives, even when your bones become dust and your name
becomes a pretty far memory.  Don't be lazy or selfish.  Be grateful
for being alive and keep surviving.  Always keep surviving to preserve
your proud people's History alive, even after wars, holocausts, and
nuclear bombs, my dear.

bitter...  ;)

Technically, I am an Atheist, Juan.  I've lost my faith in some point
of my life and I know there will not be a return, but I still pray all
the days to a God that I don't know if exists or not, asking to
protect this world and all the people, in special my loved ones.  I
don't do it for simple habit or hypocrisy, but because I really would
like to believe that there is something, someone much bigger than us,
than my dreams, than the whole universe, watching for us with some
tenderness, with compassion and love...  :'(
We never meet each other, but we both are made of atoms.  The atoms of
the sunflower that I am touching now could contain some old atoms of
your skin.  Or Tesla's, maybe.  Who knows?  Maybe God exists only in
the Science, when Chemistry makes its magic, being used to create and
recreate biological and chemical structures.  In any case, almost all
the religions deserve my respect, after analyzing some details.
Well, until a few years ago, a North-American State had a very old law
permitting to shoot in Mormons.  When I read it, I became horrified
with the religious discrimination, but a friend asked me to read about
the Mormons' beliefs before giving any opinion...  Well, I still
considered the law pretty unfair, but I simply could not accept all
those stupid stories as a formal religion.  But also all the other
religions that I studied have very contradictory and surreal facts and
acts, so I try to respect all of them, trying to get what they have of
good to offer, to teach me, and rejecting what doesn't seem logical
for me.  This year, I helped two different religions/churches with the
donations of Christmas gifts for poor children in orphanages and for
old people left alone for their own families in retirement homes.  The
past and the future of my country.  Two different churches, but I
don't follow any religion.  I just wanted a bit fairer world, less
sad, less miserable, at least for one single day of my life, of their
I am *not* a good example of the Japanese culture and I would *never*
be pretentious enough to affirm something different, Juan.  I know I
will always be considered a "gaijin" in the land of my ancestors, even
moving to there and presenting all my Japanese documentation.  My
blood is Japanese, but not my way of thinking, living, moving,
talking, feeling, or making things, and being very sincere, I do *not*
care about it.  I am exactly who I could be and I am following my own
way, still trying to be who I should be.
Well, after all the storms, the sea and the music always heal the
pain...  I can't send the sea's beauty, its amazing smell and the wind
in a message, but I will share with you a very sweet berceuse, which
was sent me today by one of my dearest, most loved friends.  He is one
of the few persons in the whole world able to identify all my texts
patterns and feelings, even when I am pretending to be happy with the
holidays.  I've lost a lovely friend this morning, have spent a great
part of this Christmas' Eve crying and listened to this song several
times because it was perfect to say goodbye to my deceased friend...
This lovely tenor has a so soft and sweet voice, so cozy as a
"Schlafe, mein Prinzchen, schlaf ein" - Rita Streich
Schlafe, mein Prinzchen, schlaf ein,
Schäfchen ruh'n und Vögelein,
Garten und Wiese verstummt,
auch nicht ein Bienchen mehr summt,
Luna mit silbernem Schein
gucket zum Fenster herein,
schlafe bei silbernem Schein,
schlafe, mein Prinzchen, schlaf ein,
schlaf ein, schlaf ein!
Auch in dem Schlosse schon liegt
alles in Schlummer gewiegt,
reget kein Mäuschen sich mehr,
Keller und Küche sind leer,
nur in der Zofe Gemach
tönet ein schmachtendes Ach!
Was für ein Ach mag das sein?
Schlafe, mein Prinzchen, schlaf ein,
schlaf ein, schlaf ein!
Wer ist beglückter als du?
Nichts als Vergnügen und Ruh'!
Spielwerk und Zucker vollauf
und noch Karossen im Lauf,
Alles besorgt und bereit,
dass nur mein Prinzchen nicht schreit.
Was wird da künftig erst sein?
Schlafe, mein Prinzchen, schlaf' ein,
schlaf ein, schlaf ein!
#  English Version
Sleep, my little prince, sleep,
The sheep and the birdies rest,
The garden and the meadow are quiet,
Not even a little bee buzzes anymore.
Luna, with a silverly glow
Looks in through the window,
Sleep by the silvery glow,
Sleep, my little prince, sleep,
Sleep, sleep!
By now, all are in bed in the castle,
All lulled into a slumber,
No more mice stir,
The basement and kitchen are empty.
Only in the maid's chambers
There sounds a languishing sigh!
What might this sigh be for?
Sleep, my little prince, sleep,
Sleep, sleep!
Who is happier than you?
Nothing but pleasure and peace!
All trinkets and sugar,
And a trotting stage-coach.
Everyone's anxious and ready
That my little prince will just not cry.
But what will the future bring?
Sleep, my little prince, sleep,
Sleep, sleep!

No, it isn't a Christmas song, sorry.  I was informed only today about
one of the members of the CypherPunks list's death and it's still
hurting a lot.  He was an amazing guy, so sweet and intelligent, so
young and full of dreams, and I've lost the chance of hugging him at
least once and say hello...  and goodbye too...
I do still not know if there is a God or not, but I really wanted to
believe that my friend is well now, with no pain or sadness, feeling
cozy, protected and loved.  I don't know about other lives, possible
karmas, and reincarnations, Heaven, Purgatory, and Hell, but in any
case, always there will be the atoms and the Chemistry to comfort me
without judgements or any kind of social hypocrisy...
My sadness is not a 'lack of faith' as some religious people say, but
simply what I am feeling now.  I am missing a dear friend, who will
never contact me again...  :'(
"Looking For An Answer - Linkin Park"
[Verse 1]
There's an emptiness tonight
A hole that wasn't there before
And I keep reaching for the light
But I can't find it anymore
There's an emptiness tonight
A heavy hand that pulls me down
They say it's gonna be alright
But can't begin to tell me how
And I ask myself out loud
Have I been lost all along?
Was there something I could say or something I should not have done?
Was I lost all along?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?
[Verse 2]
Is there sunshine where you are?
The way there was when you were here
'Cause I'm just sitting in the dark
In disbelief that this is real
In disbelief that this is real
Have I been lost all along?
Was there something I could say or something I should not have done?
Was I lost all along?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?
Was I looking for an answer when there never really was one?
And I ask myself out loud
Have I been lost all along?
Was there something I could say or something I should not have done?

Holy shit, this is still going on. This is one of the reasons I

human garbage.

It's really sad and very contradictory watching this kind of evil and
harmful people always mentioning God, Jesus and the Bible.  Hypocrites like
them deserve a special place on Hell.
If God really exists, They are pure, sincere love and absolute compassion,
never cruelty, any kind of prejudice, racism, intolerance, hate...
We are all Their sons and daughters, and we all received the gift of life
the same way.  We all are brothers and sisters, and we should make our best
for our family.
It's extremely wrong and unethical spreading so intolerant and hateful
ideas, using the Bible  - never a trustful source of "information" -  or
supposed "scientific" researches to "prove" the inferiority of other races
or genders.
I am deeply sad because good, kind and brave people are dying all the
single days...  And, unfortunately, real garbage fire people like Donald
Trump, KKK's and NAMBLA's members, Zenaan Harkness and James Donald, among

My dearest Juan,
If I want to be an Atheist, a Shinto, a Jew, a Christian, or whatever, is
my problem.  It's my opinion, my faith, my personal belief.
So, if I want to believe in a hypothetical God full of love and compassion,
the problem is mine.  Only mine, Juan.
I do have the right of imagining how would be God if They exist.  I know I
can be completely wrong about Their kindness and compassion, but...
well...  so what?  Who does care about my religious opinion?  Certainly,
not you.  :)
And already read the Bible sometimes.  It's very confused and
contradictory.  A horrible fiction book.

whites, and males.
My dear garbage fire brother,
Please, do *not* take my words of its context and stop telling daily lies.
Jeez, is it not a sin in your religion?  It's really disgusting!  :(((
I would *never* ask for any murder.  Why the heck do you think I am a
veggie since my earlier years?  Because I was a hipster, being veggie
before it becomes hype, very cool?  Hahahaha!!!  ;D
I do *not* support any death.  And, sorry, if you were not informed about
it, the life of cows, pigs, chickens, cats, dogs, koalas, and several other
animals, is *not* more important than *any human life*, including yours.
But I confess that, technically, I don't include you among the rational
beings.  Already met doggies much smarter than you.  And they were cuter
and less boring too!  :D
I do not know if there is a Hell or not, my detestable garbage fire
brother, but in positive case, we will meet there someday and, remember,
you will arrive first.  You are much older and hated than me, so the
probabilities are better on my side, hahaha!!    ;)
I hope your atoms can be used in a better way, like beautiful flowers and
trees.  James, you are a bad seed, a rotten apple in the society, spreading
hate and intolerance.  You are the broken potato chip in the package, the
one that always makes a mess and is wasted, aff...  :(((
Ah, my dear, remember that I am being banned and excluded in some feminist
radical groups for defending equality of treatment of women and men, for
really believing that intelligence and character are much more important
than genders, races, religions, sexual options, whatever...
I will always try to respect all the people, but illogical, heartless
racist, sexist, and homophobic garbage fire people like you do *not*
deserve my respect and my time.
I am deeply sorry for disappointing you, but instead of "enthusiastically
calling for the murder of Christians, whites, and males", I do prefer to
mourn the recent deaths of my friends and think about the future, about our
lost plans and dreams.
All the three were "Christian white males", but it doesn't matter.  What is
really important, what is making me cry for their deaths, is the fact that
all the three were lovely, very kind, amazing human beings, always trying
to share their knowledge and helping other people.  I will miss them until
the last of my days.
Who will cry for your death, James?  Who will miss you?  Nobody.
Bye bye, baby!  See you in Hell or maybe in another reincarnation.  It's
also a possibility to be strongly considered, because Zenaan and you are
the living proofs of the existence of other lives.  Nobody can become so
odious, hateful, and stupid in one single human life.  It takes muuuch

Social Justice Warriors always project.  I hear the voice of a woman who
has cats instead of children.
When you die, no one will notice, and your cats will eat you.
I have children, I have grandchildren.  You think you have friends, but
observe how progressives treat their "friends".
When progs die, their cats eat them.
Oh, dear...  Are you hearing the voice of a woman who has cats instead of
children?  Are you sure?  Another time, like you mentioned a semester ago
and also last year?  :((
So you are listening really bad and/or imagining things, my poor old
James...  Tsk, tsk...  Evident signals of dementia.  :-/
Well, in your age, becoming senile and mixing facts, sounds, and memories
is very natural, but I sincerely recommend you to search for some good
medical care in 2018, if you can pay for it, of course.
Good psychiatrists and otolaryngologists  (ENT doctors)  are really
expensive in your country.  Trump f_cked the healthcare pretty well in only
one year, didn't he?  ;)
I do *not* have cats or any pets and already wrote it so many times here
that even a senile old man like you could remember.  And already said
several times why are my reasons for not having children.  It was my
personal choice and I will never regret it, even loving very, very much
children and my never born daughters and sons...  I want to protect them of
people like you, Zenaan, Trump, of this unfair world, full of hate and
stupid prejudices...  <\3
Well, in any case, did you already try DNA exams?  Considering your
"fascinating personality", I bet your children can easily being postman's
and milkman's kids, hihihi...  :)
Well, anyway, having children and grandchildren means absolutely nothing,
James.  N-O-T-H-I-N-G, do you understand?  No real warranty of mourning,
drama, and tears.
Why do you think they will miss you?  Or will sincerely cry for your
death?  These are a few of all the probabilities to be considered, if you
have at least one single active neuron, James.  Too hard for you?  Oh, poor
old man!  Let me help you with very simple explanations, something nearby
to your intellectual level...  :)
They probably hate you and/or feel deeply ashamed of being related to
someone so odious, bitter, and cruel like you, that always writes hateful
texts, full of all kinds of stupid prejudices, and, all the semesters,
tries to hurt me mentioning exactly the same things...  Aff, you are so
repetitive that it probably is an obvious signal of Alzheimer's disease...
You always say you have children and grandchildren  (I will only believe
after receiving all the DNA exams results, haha!!)  and that I will be
eaten by my inexistent cats because nobody will notice my death, blah,
blah...  So f_cking what?  Why do you think it will hurt me, stupid and
limited creature?  :-/
I know it's very hard for you, but simply consider the obvious:  - I do not
care about your opinion.  I do not respect you.  I do not care about your
life or your death, about what you had or have, about what you did or do.
You means nothing for me.
And just to register it another time, I do not fear my own death.  I do
really not care about my ending.  What I fear, what hurts my heart and soul
are my loved ones' deaths, their pains...  Loving is much more important
than living, even for people like me.
I have different grades of love and friendship.  Always had, but only this
year, I finally learned to make the distinction between real friends and
those "friends" who just remember my existence when need a lawyer, my
contacts, or my knowledge about some non-public data, meetings, and
Some weeks ago, I was the only person in a group of religious studies to
accept the hypothesis of dying in that exact moment.  Already had a
gorgeous life, true love, and true friends...  Much music, all kind of
readings and people crossed my way, and my life was very fun and
interesting for myself.  Full of unexpected dramas, certainly, but I had
much more joys and sincere happiness than most of the humanity already had
and I sincerely thank the Universe, or maybe God, for this beautiful life.
I really prefer to die just right now than walking to the East of Eden for
all the eternity, never meeting the death, my own end.  It's cruel and I
cannot believe in a cruel God.  You always say you are "Christian".  OK,
which is your Christian Church, James?  There are hundreds of them in the
whole world...  :P

​There's some time, I'm trying to remember the name of a pretty disturbing
manga  (Japanese comics)  series to recommend it to Ju at n.
​ He always ​gave me great suggestions of reading, and I bet he will like
this one, even being a heavy political drama.
I read only the beggining of this novel when visited my parents and I
always forget to ask its name.  I stopped my reading because I know the end
will be very tragic.  Dreamers and their dreams are usually destroyed in
the end.
Two little boys completely lost, poor, with no family, really disappointed
with all the corruption, with all the injustices, decide to sacrifice their
personal lives to change the world.  They make a deal, one of them would be
a politician to have strenght enough to directly affect the laws and the
government, and the other would always be on the backstage, giving support
to their childhood dreams, but also would rule in another aspect of the
corrupt society.  He becomes a criminal, a great and cruel gangster.  The
beggining of this sad and bitter story shows their dawn and how corruption
exists in all the places.  They grown up together like two brothers, and
try to save the world of the corruption because both knowed what was living
on the streets, starving, suffering in a place with no compassion or
Justice even for the children...  but you can see the corruption slowly
destroying their dreams...  Slowly destroying both...  :(

​I am sure you would like the heavy social and political criticism.​  It
links the worlds of crime and politics in a very sad and bitter way,
mentioning the corruption and the hypocrisy in all sectors of the society,
in all the institutions, schools, churches, events, media...  They don't
believe in a God that permiss this corrupted world, only trust each other,
and are loyal to their childhood promise *at any cost*.  This point is
pretty sad.  They use the people to rise, my dear.  While following their
dreams of a better world, they slowly become the kind of people they
hated...  You know why I stopped my reading.  :((

​Stop lying, please.  You are faking a message, it's misattribution, I
never wrote it.
I do *not* send private messages to you because I do *not* respect you, I
do *not* trust you, and I do *not* care about you.  You are an evil and
cruel person, a liar, a hypocrite loser who likes to hurt people.
Do you want to know why I rejected you so much?  It was not because of your
uninteresting physical appearance, but because of your lack of character
and intelligence, your disgusting behaviour, so desperately needy and
invasive, always trying to impress the people with lies and fake data,
instead at least really trying to become a better person.  You are a
complete waste of space and finite resources in this world.
I don't care so much about a person's appearance, ​but you do very much, so
it's a wonderful way to annoy you and make you think about your own
insignificance, loser.  In all your private messages, it was obvious how
much you care about physical appearance.  You were always mentioning my
body, my cuteness, and sent me your pics thinking I would completely "fall
in love" with you because are a vain guy, a completely futile person.
Being sincere, you aren't a horrendous man, but are so egocentric, so
selfish and nasty, so intensely disgusting and pretentious that always was
impossible to see any beauty in your pics, needy messages and acts.
Without a good heart and intelligence, you are only an old and bald bag of
bones, an invasive jerk, a creepy stalker with dark circles under his eyes,
damaged skin and ugly beard, who thinks to be the yummiest potato chip of
the whole bag.  Bah, get a life!  (And a mirror!)
Even worst was discovering that Donald thinks Trump is handsome.  I don't
know how a sane person can see any beauty in a so disgusting man.  If he
thinks Trump is yummy, he needs to meet Zzz in person.  He will fall in
love forever because Trump is uglier than Zzz and a bit older.  It's always
bizarre when Zzz says Razer is an old man because there are some decades he
is not an young man too.  It always sounds pretty ridiculous for me, aff...
 :-/
I swear I don't care about the physical appearance of my boyfriends.
Beauty never was and is definitely not a requirement.  I rejected Zzz not
because his unappetizing appearance, but because he is always a boring
person, very invasive and needy, always having ridiculous ego trips, saying
how  """important"""  (lots of huge air quotes here!)  he is and that was
"saving the world".  He said this kind of pretentious foolish several times
in public too, on CP list months ago.
God, if this nasty nazist is "saving the world", I will grant Razer's
requests and kill myself because I do NOT want to live in his disgusting
world, full of hate, intolerance, hypocrisy, racism, ugliness and all kinds
of stupid prejudices.  I always say we need to change the world, but I am
asking for a *better world*, not for his prejudiced and limited version,
full of wars, hate, corrupt politicians and destruction.  His personal
Paradise is my infinite Hell.
Character and intelligence are much more important in a person than any
kind of beauty.  My deceased fiancé was 20 years older than me and was so
ugly that my dad asked me to not marry him because he wanted "cute
grandchildren", and considering Vincenzo's genetics, it would be almost
impossible...  And he was so thin...  God, I never liked thin men, they are
definitely not comfortable to hug and snuggle, but he was so sweet,
intelligent and kind, uff...  He was an amazing person until the last of
his days.  If reincarnation exists, hope to meet him again and never meet
Zzz in my next lives.  Already had too much of this repulsive garbage fire.
Ah, Zzz, don't feel happy about my misfortune, loser.  The thief almost
broke my arm, but hey, it's OK, because I broke his nose veryyy well and he
will have ugly nail scars in his face and neck until the last day of life!
The bad guy will need much more make up than me to hide his deep injuries,
hihi...  ;)
I don't like to hurt people, but he hurt my face, my body, my favorite
devices, a cute t-shirt and my favorite purse.  Some girls would kill him
simply because of the purse damages, so I was not so bad...  :P

​Instead sending a romantic song or a sweet poem to celebrate Valentine's

Already mentioned "The Marble Machine" and the "Floppotron" before, so
let's try different objects to make music!  :D
​Aaron McAvoy is the proud owner of the "White Trash Washing Machine", a

the first time I see this, so much time ago, and it always make me smile.
Fresh organic vegetables being used for making music and also a amazing
soup to everybody after the show.  I always loved the idea:  feeding mind,
heart and body with one single performance!
My best friend, who was a hypochondriac doctor and was still alive ten
years ago, said it was pretty unhygienic and disgusting, but accepted my
stupid challenge.  He tried to make music using his beefs, hamburgers and
sausages.  It was a musical meat disaster and a fun barbecue at same time,
hahaha!!  ;)

It's pretty fun to see Zzz whining against Lauren because he used to lick
his boots openly in public, always forwarding his posts to this list.
Involuntarily, Zzz presented Lauren to me, isn't great?  :D
Few years ago, when I was only a happy lurker here, I read one of the
messages forwarded by Zzz and wrote to Lauren just to thank him.  Year
after year, I learned to love him because I like his posts, even when I
don't agree with his opinions, and because I discovered he's very respected
for two of my best friends.  I really trust them a lot and consider both as
great ethical references.  It was also amazing to know, after some months
of relationship, that my last ex-boyfriend admired Lauren's intelligence a
lot.  He had the chance to discuss some of Google's resources and problems
with Lauren years ago and it was great, so he became one of his fans before
knowing me!  <3
​I bet Lauren loses his beauty sleep all the times when he thinks about his
haters, hahaha!!  Keep hating, Zzz.  Envy is pretty toxic and makes you
uglier!  While you're whining against Lauren, he is working and don't know
anything about your ridiculous existence.  I never told him about you and
your infinite whining, loser.  I never will tell him about your hate
speeches and all your nazist tears, but I will really try to learn violin
because it will be pretty fun to play the world's smallest violin on a

​I love Rysiek  - and his gorgeous hair! -  and miss him. ​
​Unfortunately, he is very allergic to trolls.  Meh, I need to keep some
distance!  :(
Three years ago, more or less, I was lurking here and read a very dramatic
and long discussion about top-posting.  I felt very uncomfortable.​  I
would be kicked if I had dared to tell in public that top-posting is
adopted as usual pattern of posting in South and Latin America, Italy and
in several African countries  (already received several messages from
France and Japan using it as pattern too),  so I wrote in private to Rysiek
to ask if a mere way of posting was so important to justify all that noise
and drama.
He was very kind and gentle, and patiently explained the reasons to
 top-posting
​  I always liked his messages and projects​.  He's a good person and have
cute friends too!  <3
I will return to my comfortable lurking, guys and girls.  It's the best way
to contribute to this list for now.  I am not a good coder  (I'm ridiculous
and my notebooks are worse than me!)  and seems I am attracting more
trolls.  I don't care about trolls and most of them are fake accounts
managed by the same lozzzer, but they are disturbing this list and
censoring legit manifestations, adopting "My way or No way" rules.  And
even worse, he's annoying people that I appreciate a lot...  I don't feel
secure to share some invitations and news about investigative journalism
here anymore because he and similar trolls will disturb good teams and
serious works.  I need to protect these people, not expose them to
intellectually and morally limited losers and jerks.  :(
Well, I will pretend to be dead for some days or I will need to waste my
time asking favors to Australian lawyers.  Criminals are criminals, and
most of them are real losers, in special when they have a "curious" past.
Growing up in a very dysfunctional family is *not* an excuse for lack of
Ethics and character, Zzz.  Tell us again the lie about your ex-wife,
please.  Say again how you are "saving the world" because  - everybody
knows, hahaha!! -  you are a glorious "Human Rights defender".  It will be

Zuckerberg Cut a Line About Monitoring 'Private Channels' From His Facebook
        On Thursday, Mark Zuckerberg published an updated founder's
        letter for Facebook, his first since the company went public
        in 2012. Largely summarizing the CEO's previous comments, the
        sweeping manifesto was newsworthy while containing little
        news. In at least one version of the text, however, Zuckerberg
        wrote about using artificial intelligence for online
        surveillance--a line stricken from the final draft.

Thanks, dear!  :*
The Mark Zuckerberg Manifesto Is a Blueprint for Destroying Journalism
​        ​
A sprawling new manifesto by Zuckerberg, published to Facebook
        on Thursday, should set off new alarm bells for journalists,
        and heighten news organizations' sense of urgency about how
        they--and their industry--can survive in a Facebook-dominated
        world.
​Op-ed: Mark Zuckerberg's manifesto is a political trainwreck
acebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has just published a 5,700
        word "letter" on his profile, where he asserts that Facebook
        represents one of history's "great leaps." Though he covers a
        number of topics, what's most interesting is how he positions
        Facebook as a force for political change in the coming years.
        His goals are lofty, sometimes even grandiose.  That's not the
        problem.  The problem is a fundamental contradiction built
        into the way he hopes to create what he calls a "global
        community" by essentially gerrymandering the Internet.

#  Everyone Is Super Confused About Trump’s "Last Night In Sweden" Comments
Trump Says He Was Talking About A TV Show On Sweden, Okay?
On Saturday, the president told supporters to “look what’s happening last
night in Sweden.” On Sunday, he said he was referring to a Fox News segment
that aired Friday night, not an actual incident in the country.
President Trump
​ ​
declared the
​ ​
​ ​
"The Enemy Of The American People"
, oooooh!  Pretty impressive, all his stupid mistakes are a 'media
conspiration'.  Everything he disagrees is considered as "fake news" and he
tells lies saying they are "alternative facts".
Sorry, I had stray cats and dogs more intelligent and expressive than him.
All of them were more beautiful and polite too.  I am so sorry for your
country, but the sad truth is the USA has a joke as President.  Well, all
politicians are bad taste jokes, but some are more than others.  Your
ridiculous President, for example, already gave me material for several
sketches and laughs.  Viva Trump cabron, hahaha!!  ;)
Well, don't feel so upset.  I don't have any respect for the actual
President of my country too.  Another bad joke, aff...  :(((
PS:  - I pray all the days begging to an eventual God to protect us of
nuclear explosions and wars, because this dawn orange disgrace will f_ck
the rest of the world with him.

@_subject: Trump Says, 'Look What's Happening In Sweden.' Sweden Asks, 
​Yes, I said "your President" because the President of your country is
Trump.  In my case, for example, I did't want it, but unfortunately Temer
is "my President" because is the Brazil's actual President, so their bad
and good decisions will be effective in my life and the whole country.
When I say "my President is f*cking my country", it doesn't mean he is mine
or that I am giving support to his acts.  Sorry, I should be clearer.
Someone asked me why I said I respect you.  I didn't said it in the sense
of "Oh, Jim is a human being and I need to respect all lives".  I was
talking about your past, Jim.  You fighted and protested for your beliefs
and it is a thing I respect a lot.  Nowadays, your convictions are very
different from mine in several aspects, but when you complain about a
subject, I know you really believe you are right.  You usually have
coherence.  I detest when someone is hypocrite and more false than fake
news or just want to hurt and annoy people.
Zzzz, for example, oscillates more than all my bipolar friends together,
and just wants to grant benefits at any cost because has no ethics and
moral.  Few months ago, he was whining all the days about how the USA were
the most disgusting and evil country in the whole world, all citizens
included, obviously.  Now, he licks Trump orange balls in public all the
days, always saying how amazing are the USA and their politicians.  Few
months ago, he was always saying Razer was the "guardian of this list", a
"great soul", a "huge heart", a "loyal and superior human being", "the
bastion of truth", and giving him a lot of strange titles all the days.  I
swear I was always thinking "Oh, the jerk had any success with me, so is
trying to flirt and have sex with Razer.  Needy weirdo, hahaha!!".  Now he
offends Razer all the weeks.  Maybe he is feeling rejected.  "No sex with
Ceci, no sex with Razer, Putin never answered to my love letters...  Let's
try Trump!  He loves bizarre sex and I can show him how kangoroos make wild
Now he likes to offend Mirimir too, but few months ago, this hypocrite was
always sending off-list messages to Mirimir and copying me.  I never
understood why the heck he was copying me in his private conversations.  I
think he was trying to make me feel "jealous"  - hahaha!! - because he was
openly flirting with Mirimir in his messages, almost licking the guy after
discovering his nick had Russian origins.  It was pretty embarrasing all
the times.  :P
Well, after several months of contradictions, there are lots of reasons to
think his opinions don't have any credibility or value.  My theory about
his mental absence of sanity is he is probably mixing alcohol  (Please,
don't drive drunk, selfish creature!  You are not important to anyone, but
drunk drivers like you can kill good people!), his bizarre foods  (he sent
me some creepy recipes, trying to impress me and wrote millions of times
that I should try his salad sauce, even after being ignored, with no
answers of mine in private, for several weeks, ugh!  Can you understand why
I am always saying he is slow?),  and also very strong drugs, because now
he thinks the USA are more magical than pink unicorns dancing on the
rainbows...  :P
Another person here that I can't understand is Donald.  He is zillions of
times more intelligent than Zzzz, but is cruel and likes to hurt and
humiliate people.  He can say something he knows it is *not* true only to
hurt, provoke and offend people, to have fun, a perverse kind of pleasure.
 :(
I can't say you are like them, Jim.  In all my time on CP list, you were
always coherent.  I don't agree with 80% (or even more) of your opinions,
but you are defending your beliefs, not just disturbing the list for
spreading hate and intolerance.  You, Ju at n and Razer are heard-headed guys,
but I respect you all.  And when Ju at n and Razer are not kicking me, they
are pretty fun and interesting.  I don't agree with them in a lot of
subjects too, but both sincerely like to teach people.  In some moments, J
wanted to kill me, but even when he was very very angry with me, he always
answered to my doubts about all kind of things  (bad words, grammar,
Argentine's food, interesting bibliography, good sci-fi movies, religion,
etc).  Ju at n and Razer have a good heart, even wanting my death in some
moments, hihi...  ;)
I don't think you are a bad person, Jim, but I can't agree with your point
of view and I can't respect Trump because he doesn't respect people and
their intelligence.  It's pretty offensive and illogical to say that
"something is this way simply because I am saying it is this way and the
people who don't agree with me are spreading fake news and lying".  Sorry,
the world, the life doesn't work this way.  :(
Take care, dear all.  Sorry, I won't answer to all the theories about
Sweden, rapes, news media conspirations, etc.  Everybody here already knows
my opinions and I just want a bit of peace now.  We need more crypto,
privacy and infosec posts, more interesting subjects here than only Trump's
mess.  This kind of information is very useful, we need to know what's
happening in the world and how politics work, but we already know the
problems and now we need to focus in how we will survive to them.  Kisses,
be well.  <3
PS:  - I need to write a lot of private answers, but they are more delicate
and deserve much more time and attention.  And in some moments, I don't
feel strong enough to respond, sorry.  I never told to John N. why I am
always reading books written by neuroscientists because I always cry when I
try to answer him with more details, giving more background.  My best
friend was studying neuroscience, psychiatry and psychology a lot when
suicided and I used to study with him to give some support.  We always
studied together since we meet each other because he was a genius, but very
shy and insecure.  More than 15 years studying and listening to music
together.  Some of my favorite authors are neuroscientists and I loved
deeply Oliver Sacks, already deceased.  He and my boyfriend, two of the
most intelligent and interesting persons I had the chance to exchange some
ideas about life and death, both said me that stupid thing about being a
lone wolf that I mentioned once here.  It was the most cruel curse that I
received in my whole life and I tried to kill myself when I noticed they
were right.  I didn't died, obviously.  The Hell doesn't have Internet.  ;)

It's an old song, but seems still appropriate.
Prayer Of The Refugee  -  Rise Against
Warm yourself by the fire, son
And the morning will come soon
I'll tell you stories of a better time
In a place that we once knew
Before we packed our bags
And left all this behind us in the dust
We had a place that we could call home
And a life no one could touch
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
We are the angry and the desperate
The hungry, and the cold
We're the ones who kept quiet
And always did what we were told
But we've been sweating while you slept so calm
In the safety of your home
We've been pulling out the nails that hold up
Everything you've known
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
So open your eyes, child
Let's be on our way
Broken windows and ashes
Are guiding the way
Keep quiet no longer
We'll sing through the day
Of the lives that we've lost
And the lives we've reclaimed
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't hold me up
(I don't need your help)
No! No! No!
Don't hold me up!
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't hold me up!
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't let me down, down, down, down, down!

Sorry, Eugen, the list didn't ressuct because it did never die, in

died for complete.  It always was here.  :)
Yes, you're correct, but I do still believe that minimal intervention
or no intervention are the best politics to most of the discussion
Yep, I was and I still am a moderator in some dozens of lists, and I'm
doing it in the last decade  (a bit more, in two lists).  Being a
moderator is *not* fun and takes a lot of my free time, but I know how
it can be important to keep the things working well.  That's the
reason why, in the past, I accepted to help the moderation of some
technical lists, even not being the best choice for it.  The 'best
choices' were too busy to help their pairs or simply didn't want the
work, the responsibility and, of course, the complaints, kicks and bad
words.  :(
You're always very polite, Eugen, but this isn't usually the rule and,
sorry, I don't know you well enough to predict your possible reactions
when you're upset or angry.  That's the reason why I wanted to protect
Riad and Greg a little bit, avoiding rude messages for both, sorry.
They are *not* being lazy or negligent, they are just being
anarchists.  :)
Maybe, but it just the future can show us.  For now, I still prefer to
keep my hopes in a better future and, maybe, in a better list.  :)
Stay, if you think you can change the list and make it better, not for
the list itself, but for you, for other people.  You have a good
technical background and like to study.  You can share your knowledge
and will probably be contacted in public or private for others like
you.  There are lots of trolls, but there are good people here too,
Eugen.  A bit silent, I admit, but they are still here, I swear.
Go, if you think it will be better for you.  None of us can take this
decision in your place, only you know your necessities and your
limits.  In this case, wish you good luck and success.  Take care and
be happy.
In any case, you can choose read the messages in the list archive
only, picking the titles, without receiving all the messy messages.
If you need help, contact me in private.  I'm always late with my
personal messages  (the professional ones are updated, I swear!),  but
I will answer soon or later.  :)

already did hundreds of times in the last years.  The problem is, as

Pink Floyd - Time
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.
Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain.
You are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today.
And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you.
No one told you when to run,
You missed the starting gun.
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun
But it's sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way
But you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.
Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time.
Plans that either come to naught
Or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time has gone, the song is over,
Thought I'd something more to say.
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away, across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells

Always said the guy is f_cking stupid and have no ethics, aff...  Zzz
never was the sharpest knife in the drawer, but this kind of thing
offends any intelligence.  :-/
Ah, John, a few days ago, it seems Zzzz was stupid enough for trying
to humiliate you saying he was more "intellectual" than you, hahaha!!
The fun thing was the fact he wrote the word 'intellectual' very, very
wrong.  Considering he likes to correct my English and searches
impressive words on dictionary only to pretend to be an erudite
person, it's pretty fun.  You know, English is the only language he
knows and when a person is pretentious enough to say they are
"intellectual", you think they will write "intellectual" correctly,
hahaha!!  ;D
I don't have the message to forward you, sorry.  Changed my filters
configurations some days ago, and now Zzz's messages  (and his lovely
mates)  are not sent to the trash anymore, they are completely
deleted, so I don't feel any temptation of reading their garbage.
It's OK, when he says something really stupid about us or tells a lie
about me, I am usually informed.  Some friends have a stronger stomach
than me and I love them.  :)

"If I don't have the moral courage to challenge authority... we don't
have journalism."  -  James Foley, 1973 - 2014.
The real journalism, the constant search for truth, the journalism
that empowers the poor and the weak, that has no fear of politicians
and other corrupt criminals, not the "journalism" that spreads fake
alt-right news and lies, supporting those who have the power to censor
journalism and fight against the freedom of the press.
"Journalism can never be silent: that is its greatest virtue and its
greatest fault. It must speak, and speak immediately, while the echoes
of wonder, the claims of triumph and the signs of horror are still in
the air."  -  Henry Anatole Grunwald  (Yes, he was a Republican, but
would never support censorship and "fake news".)
The Oscar version is shorter than these lyrics, has fewer verses, but
it's very sweet and heartbreaking the same.
The Empty Chair - Sting
If I should close my eyes, that my soul can see
And there's a place at the table that you saved for me
So many thousand miles over land and sea
I hope to dare, that you hear my prayer
And somehow I'll be there
It's but a concrete floor where my head will lay
And though the walls of this prison are as cold as clay
But there's a shaft of light where I count my days
So don't despair of the empty chair
And somehow I'll be there
Some days I'm strong, some days I'm weak
And days I'm so broken I can barely speak
There’s a place in my head where my thoughts still roam
Where somehow I've come home
And when the Winter comes and the trees lie bare
And you just stare out the window in the darkness there
Well I was always late for every meal you'll swear
But keep my place and the empty chair
And somehow I'll be there
And somehow I'll be there

Nobody knows how many hate crimes and bias incidents take place each
year in the USA.  They asked help to track them.
The 'Documenting Hate' Project wants transparency about relevant data
that is *not* known because most of the times are ignored or receive
more make-up than all Hollywood actresses in Oscar's night.  If you
really think that happened a hate crime against a "straight white
man", OK, report it and justify the reasons of your convincement.  The
same to attacks to all the colors, races, ethnicities, genders,
religions, trans status, disabilities, and sexual orientations.  It
isn't about Trump and politics, it's about peace, about life, about
Justice and a fairer, more transparent world, where this kind of
hateful action is *not* tolerated or ignored.

​There's some time, I'm trying to remember the name of a pretty disturbing
manga  (Japanese comics)  series to recommend it to Ju at n.
​ He always ​gave me great suggestions of reading, and I bet he will like
this one, even being a heavy political drama.
I read only the beggining of this novel when visited my parents and I
always forget to ask its name.  I stopped my reading because I know the end
will be very tragic.  Dreamers and their dreams are usually destroyed in
the end.
Two little boys completely lost, poor, with no family, really disappointed
with all the corruption, with all the injustices, decide to sacrifice their
personal lives to change the world.  They make a deal, one of them would be
a politician to have strenght enough to directly affect the laws and the
government, and the other would always be on the backstage, giving support
to their childhood dreams, but also would rule in another aspect of the
corrupt society.  He becomes a criminal, a great and cruel gangster.  The
beggining of this sad and bitter story shows their dawn and how corruption
exists in all the places.  They grown up together like two brothers, and
try to save the world of the corruption because both knowed what was living
on the streets, starving, suffering in a place with no compassion or
Justice even for the children...  but you can see the corruption slowly
destroying their dreams...  Slowly destroying both...  :(

​I am sure you would like the heavy social and political criticism.​  It
links the worlds of crime and politics in a very sad and bitter way,
mentioning the corruption and the hypocrisy in all sectors of the society,
in all the institutions, schools, churches, events, media...  They don't
believe in a God that permiss this corrupted world, only trust each other,
and are loyal to their childhood promise *at any cost*.  This point is
pretty sad.  They use the people to rise, my dear.  While following their
dreams of a better world, they slowly become the kind of people they
hated...  You know why I stopped my reading.  :((

​Stop lying, please.  You are faking a message, it's misattribution, I
never wrote it.
I do *not* send private messages to you because I do *not* respect you, I
do *not* trust you, and I do *not* care about you.  You are an evil and
cruel person, a liar, a hypocrite loser who likes to hurt people.
Do you want to know why I rejected you so much?  It was not because of your
uninteresting physical appearance, but because of your lack of character
and intelligence, your disgusting behaviour, so desperately needy and
invasive, always trying to impress the people with lies and fake data,
instead at least really trying to become a better person.  You are a
complete waste of space and finite resources in this world.
I don't care so much about a person's appearance, ​but you do very much, so
it's a wonderful way to annoy you and make you think about your own
insignificance, loser.  In all your private messages, it was obvious how
much you care about physical appearance.  You were always mentioning my
body, my cuteness, and sent me your pics thinking I would completely "fall
in love" with you because are a vain guy, a completely futile person.
Being sincere, you aren't a horrendous man, but are so egocentric, so
selfish and nasty, so intensely disgusting and pretentious that always was
impossible to see any beauty in your pics, needy messages and acts.
Without a good heart and intelligence, you are only an old and bald bag of
bones, an invasive jerk, a creepy stalker with dark circles under his eyes,
damaged skin and ugly beard, who thinks to be the yummiest potato chip of
the whole bag.  Bah, get a life!  (And a mirror!)
Even worst was discovering that Donald thinks Trump is handsome.  I don't
know how a sane person can see any beauty in a so disgusting man.  If he
thinks Trump is yummy, he needs to meet Zzz in person.  He will fall in
love forever because Trump is uglier than Zzz and a bit older.  It's always
bizarre when Zzz says Razer is an old man because there are some decades he
is not an young man too.  It always sounds pretty ridiculous for me, aff...
 :-/
I swear I don't care about the physical appearance of my boyfriends.
Beauty never was and is definitely not a requirement.  I rejected Zzz not
because his unappetizing appearance, but because he is always a boring
person, very invasive and needy, always having ridiculous ego trips, saying
how  """important"""  (lots of huge air quotes here!)  he is and that was
"saving the world".  He said this kind of pretentious foolish several times
in public too, on CP list months ago.
God, if this nasty nazist is "saving the world", I will grant Razer's
requests and kill myself because I do NOT want to live in his disgusting
world, full of hate, intolerance, hypocrisy, racism, ugliness and all kinds
of stupid prejudices.  I always say we need to change the world, but I am
asking for a *better world*, not for his prejudiced and limited version,
full of wars, hate, corrupt politicians and destruction.  His personal
Paradise is my infinite Hell.
Character and intelligence are much more important in a person than any
kind of beauty.  My deceased fiancé was 20 years older than me and was so
ugly that my dad asked me to not marry him because he wanted "cute
grandchildren", and considering Vincenzo's genetics, it would be almost
impossible...  And he was so thin...  God, I never liked thin men, they are
definitely not comfortable to hug and snuggle, but he was so sweet,
intelligent and kind, uff...  He was an amazing person until the last of

Zzz in my next lives.  Already had too much of this repulsive garbage fire.
Ah, Zzz, don't feel happy about my misfortune, loser.  The thief almost
broke my arm, but hey, it's OK, because I broke his nose veryyy well and he
will have ugly nail scars in his face and neck until the last day of life!
The bad guy will need much more make up than me to hide his deep injuries,
hihi...  ;)
I don't like to hurt people, but he hurt my face, my body, my favorite
devices, a cute t-shirt and my favorite purse.  Some girls would kill him
simply because of the purse damages, so I was not so bad...  :P

Already mentioned "The Marble Machine" and the "Floppotron" before, so
let's try different objects to make music!  :D
​Aaron McAvoy is the proud owner of the "White Trash Washing Machine", a

the first time I see this, so much time ago, and it always make me smile.
Fresh organic vegetables being used for making music and also a amazing
soup to everybody after the show.  I always loved the idea:  feeding mind,
heart and body with one single performance!
My best friend, who was a hypochondriac doctor and was still alive ten
years ago, said it was pretty unhygienic and disgusting, but accepted my
stupid challenge.  He tried to make music using his beefs, hamburgers and
sausages.  It was a musical meat disaster and a fun barbecue at same time,
hahaha!!  ;)

It's pretty fun to see Zzz whining against Lauren because he used to lick
his boots openly in public, always forwarding his posts to this list.
Involuntarily, Zzz presented Lauren to me, isn't great?  :D
Few years ago, when I was only a happy lurker here, I read one of the
messages forwarded by Zzz and wrote to Lauren just to thank him.  Year
after year, I learned to love him because I like his posts, even when I
don't agree with his opinions, and because I discovered he's very respected
for two of my best friends.  I really trust them a lot and consider both as
great ethical references.  It was also amazing to know, after some months
of relationship, that my last ex-boyfriend admired Lauren's intelligence a
lot.  He had the chance to discuss some of Google's resources and problems
with Lauren years ago and it was great, so he became one of his fans before
knowing me!  <3
​I bet Lauren loses his beauty sleep all the times when he thinks about his
haters, hahaha!!  Keep hating, Zzz.  Envy is pretty toxic and makes you
uglier!  While you're whining against Lauren, he is working and don't know
anything about your ridiculous existence.  I never told him about you and
your infinite whining, loser.  I never will tell him about your hate
speeches and all your nazist tears, but I will really try to learn violin

​Unfortunately, he is very allergic to trolls.  Meh, I need to keep some
distance!  :(
Three years ago, more or less, I was lurking here and read a very dramatic
and long discussion about top-posting.  I felt very uncomfortable.​  I
would be kicked if I had dared to tell in public that top-posting is
adopted as usual pattern of posting in South and Latin America, Italy and
in several African countries  (already received several messages from
France and Japan using it as pattern too),  so I wrote in private to Rysiek
to ask if a mere way of posting was so important to justify all that noise
and drama.
He was very kind and gentle, and patiently explained the reasons to
 top-posting
​  I always liked his messages and projects​.  He's a good person and have
cute friends too!  <3
I will return to my comfortable lurking, guys and girls.  It's the best way
to contribute to this list for now.  I am not a good coder  (I'm ridiculous
and my notebooks are worse than me!)  and seems I am attracting more
trolls.  I don't care about trolls and most of them are fake accounts
managed by the same lozzzer, but they are disturbing this list and
censoring legit manifestations, adopting "My way or No way" rules.  And
even worse, he's annoying people that I appreciate a lot...  I don't feel
secure to share some invitations and news about investigative journalism
here anymore because he and similar trolls will disturb good teams and
serious works.  I need to protect these people, not expose them to
intellectually and morally limited losers and jerks.  :(
Well, I will pretend to be dead for some days or I will need to waste my
time asking favors to Australian lawyers.  Criminals are criminals, and
most of them are real losers, in special when they have a "curious" past.
Growing up in a very dysfunctional family is *not* an excuse for lack of
Ethics and character, Zzz.  Tell us again the lie about your ex-wife,
please.  Say again how you are "saving the world" because  - everybody

Zuckerberg Cut a Line About Monitoring 'Private Channels' From His Facebook
        On Thursday, Mark Zuckerberg published an updated founder's
        letter for Facebook, his first since the company went public
        in 2012. Largely summarizing the CEO's previous comments, the
        sweeping manifesto was newsworthy while containing little
        news. In at least one version of the text, however, Zuckerberg
        wrote about using artificial intelligence for online
        surveillance--a line stricken from the final draft.

Thanks, dear!  :*
The Mark Zuckerberg Manifesto Is a Blueprint for Destroying Journalism
​        ​
A sprawling new manifesto by Zuckerberg, published to Facebook
        on Thursday, should set off new alarm bells for journalists,
        and heighten news organizations' sense of urgency about how
        they--and their industry--can survive in a Facebook-dominated
        world.
​Op-ed: Mark Zuckerberg's manifesto is a political trainwreck
acebook founder Mark Zuckerberg has just published a 5,700
        word "letter" on his profile, where he asserts that Facebook
        represents one of history's "great leaps." Though he covers a
        number of topics, what's most interesting is how he positions
        Facebook as a force for political change in the coming years.
        His goals are lofty, sometimes even grandiose.  That's not the
        problem.  The problem is a fundamental contradiction built
        into the way he hopes to create what he calls a "global
        community" by essentially gerrymandering the Internet.

All of them were more beautiful and polite too.  I am so sorry for your
country, but the sad truth is the USA has a joke as President.  Well, all
politicians are bad taste jokes, but some are more than others.  Your
ridiculous President, for example, already gave me material for several
sketches and laughs.  Viva Trump cabron, hahaha!!  ;)
Well, don't feel so upset.  I don't have any respect for the actual
President of my country too.  Another bad joke, aff...  :(((

@_subject: Trump Says, 'Look What's Happening In Sweden.' Sweden Asks, 
​Yes, I said "your President" because the President of your country is
Trump.  In my case, for example, I did't want it, but unfortunately Temer
is "my President" because is the Brazil's actual President, so their bad
and good decisions will be effective in my life and the whole country.
When I say "my President is f*cking my country", it doesn't mean he is mine
or that I am giving support to his acts.  Sorry, I should be clearer.
Someone asked me why I said I respect you.  I didn't said it in the sense
of "Oh, Jim is a human being and I need to respect all lives".  I was
talking about your past, Jim.  You fighted and protested for your beliefs
and it is a thing I respect a lot.  Nowadays, your convictions are very
different from mine in several aspects, but when you complain about a
subject, I know you really believe you are right.  You usually have
coherence.  I detest when someone is hypocrite and more false than fake
news or just want to hurt and annoy people.
Zzzz, for example, oscillates more than all my bipolar friends together,
and just wants to grant benefits at any cost because has no ethics and
moral.  Few months ago, he was whining all the days about how the USA were
the most disgusting and evil country in the whole world, all citizens
included, obviously.  Now, he licks Trump orange balls in public all the
days, always saying how amazing are the USA and their politicians.  Few
months ago, he was always saying Razer was the "guardian of this list", a
"great soul", a "huge heart", a "loyal and superior human being", "the
bastion of truth", and giving him a lot of strange titles all the days.  I
swear I was always thinking "Oh, the jerk had any success with me, so is
trying to flirt and have sex with Razer.  Needy weirdo, hahaha!!".  Now he
offends Razer all the weeks.  Maybe he is feeling rejected.  "No sex with
Ceci, no sex with Razer, Putin never answered to my love letters...  Let's
try Trump!  He loves bizarre sex and I can show him how kangoroos make wild
Now he likes to offend Mirimir too, but few months ago, this hypocrite was
always sending off-list messages to Mirimir and copying me.  I never
understood why the heck he was copying me in his private conversations.  I
think he was trying to make me feel "jealous"  - hahaha!! - because he was
openly flirting with Mirimir in his messages, almost licking the guy after
discovering his nick had Russian origins.  It was pretty embarrasing all
the times.  :P
Well, after several months of contradictions, there are lots of reasons to
think his opinions don't have any credibility or value.  My theory about
his mental absence of sanity is he is probably mixing alcohol  (Please,
don't drive drunk, selfish creature!  You are not important to anyone, but
drunk drivers like you can kill good people!), his bizarre foods  (he sent
me some creepy recipes, trying to impress me and wrote millions of times
that I should try his salad sauce, even after being ignored, with no
answers of mine in private, for several weeks, ugh!  Can you understand why
I am always saying he is slow?),  and also very strong drugs, because now
he thinks the USA are more magical than pink unicorns dancing on the
rainbows...  :P
Another person here that I can't understand is Donald.  He is zillions of
times more intelligent than Zzzz, but is cruel and likes to hurt and
humiliate people.  He can say something he knows it is *not* true only to
hurt, provoke and offend people, to have fun, a perverse kind of pleasure.
 :(
I can't say you are like them, Jim.  In all my time on CP list, you were
always coherent.  I don't agree with 80% (or even more) of your opinions,
but you are defending your beliefs, not just disturbing the list for
spreading hate and intolerance.  You, Ju at n and Razer are heard-headed guys,
but I respect you all.  And when Ju at n and Razer are not kicking me, they
are pretty fun and interesting.  I don't agree with them in a lot of
subjects too, but both sincerely like to teach people.  In some moments, J
wanted to kill me, but even when he was very very angry with me, he always
answered to my doubts about all kind of things  (bad words, grammar,
Argentine's food, interesting bibliography, good sci-fi movies, religion,
etc).  Ju at n and Razer have a good heart, even wanting my death in some
moments, hihi...  ;)
I don't think you are a bad person, Jim, but I can't agree with your point
of view and I can't respect Trump because he doesn't respect people and
their intelligence.  It's pretty offensive and illogical to say that
"something is this way simply because I am saying it is this way and the
people who don't agree with me are spreading fake news and lying".  Sorry,
the world, the life doesn't work this way.  :(
Take care, dear all.  Sorry, I won't answer to all the theories about
Sweden, rapes, news media conspirations, etc.  Everybody here already knows
my opinions and I just want a bit of peace now.  We need more crypto,
privacy and infosec posts, more interesting subjects here than only Trump's
mess.  This kind of information is very useful, we need to know what's
happening in the world and how politics work, but we already know the
problems and now we need to focus in how we will survive to them.  Kisses,
be well.  <3
PS:  - I need to write a lot of private answers, but they are more delicate
and deserve much more time and attention.  And in some moments, I don't
feel strong enough to respond, sorry.  I never told to John N. why I am
always reading books written by neuroscientists because I always cry when I
try to answer him with more details, giving more background.  My best
friend was studying neuroscience, psychiatry and psychology a lot when
suicided and I used to study with him to give some support.  We always
studied together since we meet each other because he was a genius, but very
shy and insecure.  More than 15 years studying and listening to music
together.  Some of my favorite authors are neuroscientists and I loved
deeply Oliver Sacks, already deceased.  He and my boyfriend, two of the
most intelligent and interesting persons I had the chance to exchange some
ideas about life and death, both said me that stupid thing about being a
lone wolf that I mentioned once here.  It was the most cruel curse that I
received in my whole life and I tried to kill myself when I noticed they
were right.  I didn't died, obviously.  The Hell doesn't have Internet.  ;)

It's an old song, but seems still appropriate.
Prayer Of The Refugee  -  Rise Against
Warm yourself by the fire, son
And the morning will come soon
I'll tell you stories of a better time
In a place that we once knew
Before we packed our bags
And left all this behind us in the dust
We had a place that we could call home
And a life no one could touch
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
We are the angry and the desperate
The hungry, and the cold
We're the ones who kept quiet
And always did what we were told
But we've been sweating while you slept so calm
In the safety of your home
We've been pulling out the nails that hold up
Everything you've known
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
So open your eyes, child
Let's be on our way
Broken windows and ashes
Are guiding the way
Keep quiet no longer
We'll sing through the day
Of the lives that we've lost
And the lives we've reclaimed
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up now
I can stand my own ground
I don't need your help now
You will let me down, down, down!
Don't hold me up
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't hold me up
(I don't need your help)
No! No! No!
Don't hold me up!
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't hold me up!
(I don't need your help, I'll stand my ground)
Don't let me down, down, down, down, down!

Sorry, Eugen, the list didn't ressuct because it did never die, in

died for complete.  It always was here.  :)
Yes, you're correct, but I do still believe that minimal intervention
or no intervention are the best politics to most of the discussion
Yep, I was and I still am a moderator in some dozens of lists, and I'm
doing it in the last decade  (a bit more, in two lists).  Being a
moderator is *not* fun and takes a lot of my free time, but I know how
it can be important to keep the things working well.  That's the
reason why, in the past, I accepted to help the moderation of some
technical lists, even not being the best choice for it.  The 'best
choices' were too busy to help their pairs or simply didn't want the
work, the responsibility and, of course, the complaints, kicks and bad
words.  :(
You're always very polite, Eugen, but this isn't usually the rule and,
sorry, I don't know you well enough to predict your possible reactions
when you're upset or angry.  That's the reason why I wanted to protect
Riad and Greg a little bit, avoiding rude messages for both, sorry.
They are *not* being lazy or negligent, they are just being
anarchists.  :)
Maybe, but it just the future can show us.  For now, I still prefer to
keep my hopes in a better future and, maybe, in a better list.  :)
Stay, if you think you can change the list and make it better, not for
the list itself, but for you, for other people.  You have a good
technical background and like to study.  You can share your knowledge
and will probably be contacted in public or private for others like
you.  There are lots of trolls, but there are good people here too,
Eugen.  A bit silent, I admit, but they are still here, I swear.
Go, if you think it will be better for you.  None of us can take this
decision in your place, only you know your necessities and your
limits.  In this case, wish you good luck and success.  Take care and
be happy.
In any case, you can choose read the messages in the list archive
only, picking the titles, without receiving all the messy messages.
If you need help, contact me in private.  I'm always late with my
personal messages  (the professional ones are updated, I swear!),  but
I will answer soon or later.  :)

complaints.  He has the right of expressing his preferences, as you
already did hundreds of times in the last years.  The problem is, as
he involuntarily confessed to the whole list yesterday, he doesn't

Pink Floyd - Time
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
You fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way.
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way.
Tired of lying in the sunshine
Staying home to watch the rain.
You are young and life is long
And there is time to kill today.
And then one day you find
Ten years have got behind you.
No one told you when to run,
You missed the starting gun.
And you run and you run to catch up with the sun
But it's sinking
And racing around to come up behind you again.
The sun is the same in a relative way
But you're older,
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death.
Every year is getting shorter
Never seem to find the time.
Plans that either come to naught
Or half a page of scribbled lines
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way
The time has gone, the song is over,
Thought I'd something more to say.
Home, home again
I like to be here when I can
When I come home cold and tired
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire
Far away, across the field
The tolling of the iron bell
Calls the faithful to their knees
To hear the softly spoken magic spells

@_subject: [OT] [song] The Empty Chair - Sting 
"If I don't have the moral courage to challenge authority... we don't
have journalism."  -  James Foley, 1973 - 2014.
The real journalism, the constant search for truth, the journalism
that empowers the poor and the weak, that has no fear of politicians
and other corrupt criminals, not the "journalism" that spreads fake
alt-right news and lies, supporting those who have the power to censor
journalism and fight against the freedom of the press.
"Journalism can never be silent: that is its greatest virtue and its
greatest fault. It must speak, and speak immediately, while the echoes
of wonder, the claims of triumph and the signs of horror are still in
the air."  -  Henry Anatole Grunwald  (Yes, he was a Republican, but
would never support censorship and "fake news".)
The Oscar version is shorter than these lyrics, has fewer verses, but
it's very sweet and heartbreaking the same.
The Empty Chair - Sting
If I should close my eyes, that my soul can see
And there's a place at the table that you saved for me
So many thousand miles over land and sea
I hope to dare, that you hear my prayer
And somehow I'll be there
It's but a concrete floor where my head will lay
And though the walls of this prison are as cold as clay
But there's a shaft of light where I count my days
So don't despair of the empty chair
And somehow I'll be there
Some days I'm strong, some days I'm weak
And days I'm so broken I can barely speak
There’s a place in my head where my thoughts still roam
Where somehow I've come home
And when the Winter comes and the trees lie bare
And you just stare out the window in the darkness there
Well I was always late for every meal you'll swear
But keep my place and the empty chair
And somehow I'll be there
And somehow I'll be there

Nobody knows how many hate crimes and bias incidents take place each
year in the USA.  They asked help to track them.
The 'Documenting Hate' Project wants transparency about relevant data
that is *not* known because most of the times are ignored or receive
more make-up than all Hollywood actresses in Oscar's night.  If you
really think that happened a hate crime against a "straight white
man", OK, report it and justify the reasons of your convincement.  The
same to attacks to all the colors, races, ethnicities, genders,
religions, trans status, disabilities, and sexual orientations.  It
isn't about Trump and politics, it's about peace, about life, about
Justice and a fairer, more transparent world, where this kind of
hateful action is *not* tolerated or ignored.

years, full of love, good life projects and happy endings...  <3
I know some people here will think "Seasons Of Love" is 'cheesy' or it
sucks, but this is one of my favorite songs and I think it has a good
message about measuring the years of our lives.
Live long and prosper.  And sincerely try to be happy.  I am not asking to
ignore all the fuckups in the whole world, it's impossible, but to manage
them and their effects in the best possible way, trying to live well, with
serenity, with less hate, anger, bad feelings in your heart...  :)
There is a lovely Brazilian song, a beautiful musical poem named 'Samba da
Benção'  ('Blessing Samba' or 'Blessed Samba?  I don't know the best
translation in this case, sorry!)  which begins with the verses  "É melhor
ser alegre que ser triste / Alegria é a melhor coisa que existe / É assim
como a luz no coração"  ("It's better to be happy than to be sad /
Happiness is the best thing that exists / It's like a light in the
heart").  It's true!  :)
  (Lyrics in English,
it isn't a "wow, the best translation in the whole world!", but it's better
than my translation, obviously, haha!!  ;)
This version by Vinicius de Moraes is pretty sweet.  I love Vinicius.  As
he says in the poem, he was "the blackest white man in the Brazil" and
talks about happyness, sadness, love, "saudade", and pay tribute to the
African Gods and the black origins of samba, one of most famous Brazilian
musical styles.
Happy New Year!!!  :D

"Black ape"?!
Like all the "Homo sapiens sapiens" of this planet, you have a strong
connection with simians.  Did you already study the human evolution?  If
you really think that black people are "black apes", you are a "white ape"
and, obviously, not one of the most intelligent "apes" of your specie.
I do _not_ support any kind of discrimination against races and I do
believe it's terribly wrong and immoral to judge someone for their skin's
color.  I am not supporting any actions against white people, but the black
people always suffered serious injustices committed by white people.  How
do you think they should feel about it?  Happy, grateful for being killed,
for being considered an "inferior" race and treated as slaves before in
History and now as criminals?  It's really easy to understand their revolt,
their pain.  You don't need to be a smart person to understand it.
Injustice always hurts.
Some people have black skin and it's pretty beautiful.  Really ugly
is being a heartless person, a human being able to humiliate brothers and
sisters of the same specie calling them "apes".
You are North American, right?  In few days, you will have the kind of
President that you deserve.  I sincerely wish USA lots of good luck.  Most
of the people of your country deserve my consideration and respect, but
people like you and "Tramp" spread hate, violence, prejudices and all kinds
of intolerance in the world.  Hope you both and all those who give support

*"Galaxy Song" - Monty Python's The Meaning of Life*
Whenever life gets you down, Mrs. Brown,
And things seem hard or tough,
And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft,
And you feel that you've had quite eno-o-o-o-o-ough,
Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
And revolving at 900 miles an hour.
It's orbiting at 19 miles a second, so it's reckoned,
The sun that is the source of all our power.
Now the sun, and you and me, and all the stars that we can see,
Are moving at a million miles a day,
In the outer spiral arm, at 40,000 miles an hour,
Of a galaxy we call the Milky Way.
Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars;
It's a hundred thousand light-years side to side;
It bulges in the middle sixteen thousand light-years thick,
But out by us it's just three thousand light-years wide.
We're thirty thousand light-years from Galactic Central Point,
We go 'round every two hundred million years;
And our galaxy itself is one of millions of billions
In this amazing and expanding universe.

Juan, my dear,
Please, ignore these stupid provocations.  Do not feed the trolls, please.
If necessary, I will 'feed' them because, you know, my kicks are stronger
and my head is millions of times harder than yours, hihihi...  :)
Zzz is creating a lot of fake e-mail addresses to disturb the CypherPunks
list, but is dumb enough to repeat several of the patterns he already used
to attack and offend me in the last months.  The loser is doing it since
the last October and he is pretty repetitive and s-l-o-o-o-o-o-w...  I am
always receiving spam and stupid aggressive messages in private, but I do
not care about it.  Better in private than in our list, la la la...  :)

he is the only Australian person that I know...  Well, he never was a smart
person.  Racists never are much smart.  There are a lot of scientific
studies making connections among racism, prejudices and lack of
intelligence, but guys like him don't like studying and prefer to envy
Harvard students and teachers, hihihi...  :))
His luck is I really believe I should not hurt any animal, even the most
stupid racists.  But, well, you probably remember what I always say about
Oriental patience, my dear Juan.  It's definitely not infinite.  Who knows
what will happen in the future?  Maybe some la-la-la-leaks...  Why should
someone give credibility, job or any kind of money to stupid racist persons

decided to remember you how much all the colors are really beautiful.  I do
love rainbows and unicorns, and cooking and baking colorful food is a sweet
fun way of saying "I love you because you make my life more beautiful...  I
love all your colors and no rainbow is more wonderful than you or can bring
more joy to my days..."  <3

and for myself, hihi...  <3  <3  <3

it is not 'that traditional way', hahaha!!  ;D)

pasta!    :D
And this one is for the

Donald Duck

Please, bitches, stop disturbing the list with your ridiculous babbling
against black people, African people, Asian people, Muslims, women, etc,
etc.  It's so simple:  -  We are gorgeous, bright and beautiful.  You are
not.  Die with all these envy and hate or learn to manage your feelings
better, in a rational and less childish way.
As I said months ago...  Sorry, I don't respect dumb, stupid and
pretentious people, with a huge complex of superiority and an ego bigger
than Putin's baldness and Tramp's ignorance.  But if you both want to
complain about who has the biggest ego, please, always remember:  -  I am
fabulous, bitches.  You both are donkeys, I am a colorful unicorn.  You
walk, I parade.  You will be dust, I will be shining glitter, la la la...

now I am using Pink Himalayan Salt in my recipes!  PINK salt, yay!
 And I am trying to use the salt in this
 way:
 (OK, I know it's meat...  Lots and lots of meat, but
​the cook​

I am making some tests with DIY
​Lush style colorful ​
bath bombs and bubble bars,
​but I need more ​
​time and much more ingredients.  I will share the products recipes if I
get some results cute enough for being good Valentine's gifts!  <3
Lush products are amazing, perfect, with awesome results, colors and
smells, but too expensive for most of the consumers.  I will need essential
oils, vegan waxes and pigments, dehidrated flowers, ecological vegetable
butters, biodegradable glitter, lots of love...  Smells, colors,
textures...  Yep, my loved Mirimir, it would be my second dream job, right
after working with comics!  This kind of thing makes my nose, my eyes and
my heart very happy!  :D
Music would be amazing, but I sing really bad and I am not a talented
musician.  Oh, if someone wants to make part of the Music Hackspace in
London, their selection for Freelance Programme Coordinator is open!  :D
Kisses, hugs and good lovely colors for you all, LESS the homophobic,
mysogynist, Islamophobic racists because my nose is pretty sensitive and I

It was *Trump’s Inauguration Speech*:
*"Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President
Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank
you.We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort
to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our
people.Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for
years to come.We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we
will get the job done.Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry
out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to
President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid
throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.Today’s ceremony,
however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely
transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to
another – but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it
back to you, the American People.For too long, a small group in our
nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have
borne the cost.Washington flourished – but the people did not share in its
wealth.Politicians prospered – but the jobs left, and the factories
closed.The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our
country.Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have
not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation’s Capital,
there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our
land.That all changes – starting right here, and right now, because this
moment is your moment: it belongs to you.It belongs to everyone gathered
here today and everyone watching all across America.This is your day. This
is your celebration.And this, the United States of America, is your
country.What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but
whether our government is controlled by the people.January 20th 2017, will
be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation
again.The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no
longer.Everyone is listening to you now.You came by the tens of millions to
become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never
seen before.At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a
nation exists to serve its citizens.Americans want great schools for their
children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for
themselves.These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous
public.But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists:
Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out
factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an
education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful
students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have
stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized
potential.This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.We are
one nation – and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and
their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one
glorious destiny.The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance
to all Americans.For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the
expense of American industry;Subsidized the armies of other countries while
allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;We’ve defended other
nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own;And spent trillions of
dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair
and decay.We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and
confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.One by one, the
factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the
millions upon millions of American workers left behind.The wealth of our
middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across
the entire world.But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the
future.We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in
every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.From this
day forward, a new vision will govern our land.From this moment on, it’s
going to be America First.Every decision on trade, on taxes, on
immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers
and American families.We must protect our borders from the ravages of other
countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our
jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.I will fight
for you with every breath in my body – and I will never, ever let you
down.America will start winning again, winning like never before.We will
bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our
wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.We will build new roads, and
highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across
our wonderful nation.We will get our people off of welfare and back to work
– rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.We will
follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.We will seek
friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with
the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own
interests first.We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but
rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.We will
reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world
against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from
the face of the Earth.At the bedrock of our politics will be a total
allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our
country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.When you open your
heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.The Bible tells us,
“how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity.”We
must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always
pursue solidarity.When America is united, America is totally
unstoppable.There should be no fear – we are protected, and we will always
be protected.We will be protected by the great men and women of our
military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by
God.Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.In America, we
understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.We will
no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action – constantly
complaining but never doing anything about it.The time for empty talk is
over.Now arrives the hour of action.Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be
done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.We
will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.We stand at the
birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free
the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies,
industries and technologies of tomorrow.A new national pride will stir our
souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.It is time to remember that
old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or
brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy
the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American
Flag.And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the
windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill
their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of
life by the same almighty Creator.So to all Americans, in every city near
and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to
ocean, hear these words:You will never be ignored again.Your voice, your
hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage
and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.Together, We Will
Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make
America Proud Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And, Yes, Together, We
Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, God Bless You, And God Bless

I don't have his email address, but I will ask.  He already visited my city
few years ago (2014, I think) and is a very charismatic and interesting
A curiosity about the Brazilian academic world:  -  Here a little fairy

About your private answer to Donald
​ and me​
...  Is the guy crazy?
​I am not reading his messages, but it was surprising.  ​
Tramp is definitely NOT handsome!
​ ​
He's an old overweighted man  (see his belly
!),  with very flaccid skin  (see his neck, it's
​pretty ​
disgusting, eeck!),  more wrinkles around the eyes than a
​n old​
Shar-Pei dog and an ugly mouth
​, with no lips​
.  He has a
​ ​
grotesque fake tan, a ridiculously ugly dyed hair
​ ​
​ ​
Oompa Loompas are cuter
​ and more useful​
than him.  He's not a white man anymore, he's orange like urine with excess
of betacarotene.
​  Donald probably has very, veeeryyy ugly boyfriends, uuugh!  :((​

*Declaration Against Corruption*
"Corruption – the abuse of entrusted power for private gain – is wrong. It
destroys the basic rights of hundreds of millions of people across the
world, it has devastating consequences on the services provided by public
institutions and it undermines the prospect for a better life for future
I believe together we can work towards ending corruption, overcoming
widespread injustice and impunity.
All forms of corruption must be ended to secure the basic rights of all
people and ensure a world where everyone can live in dignity.
This Declaration Against Corruption is consistent with and supportive of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Convention
against Corruption. It is also consistent with Transparency International’s
core values: Transparency, Accountability, Integrity, Solidarity, Courage,
Justice, Democracy."
"I will not pay bribes.
I will not seek bribes.

*Masters Of War​  -  Bob Dylan*
Come you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build the big bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks
You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain
You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud
You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul
And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand o'er your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead

It would be a honor for me.  I do respect and admire John Young and I am
sure I would be in good company, Zenaan.  You, instead, are a childish
looser, a disgusting spammer who nobody wants nearby and will never
respect. ​
About the another disgusting message...  Yes, I am dying in this exact
moment.  Also you, did you know?  Probably not.  Hey, you are a very
slo-o-o-w-w-w creature, not much smart or intelligent, so I will give you a
good tip:  -  Learn more about Biology and Chemistry to understand my
point.  You will spend a good time studying and, without your harmful
presence, this list will be lighter and much more interesting!  Please take
that whining bitter bitch, Donald, with you.  It's pretty romantic to study
together and you both need to learn more about Science!  :D
I never understand how contradictory and confuse you can be.  You are
blaming, snitching and making disgusting 'ad hominem' attacks _all the
single days_, but at same time, you are always pretending to be an eternal
victim, mentioning how much you receive 'ad hominem' attacks like a little
scared girl.  You are the princess in danger here, not me.  Sorry, I don't
need to make lots and lots of drama to finally ask help to men like you do,
Zenaan.  I don't need it, I can do the same things that a man do, but using
make-up and high heels.  And glitter, yay!!!  :D
Please, stop being so destructive and disturbing the list with messages
full of hate and intolerance against black people, LGBT people, Muslim
people, women, etc...  You are always spreading hate against everybody
different from you and are so contradictory that, few months ago, you were
saying Razer was awesome protecting this list.  Now you are offending him
daily.  What happened?  Did he also reject your sexual and romantic
interests?  Did you also send your pics and a lot of cheesy messages to
him?  Did you try to stalk him too?  :))
Guy, you are really horrible doing this, hahaha!!  I am completely sure you
don't work to NSA because they definitely know to stalk a person, hahaha!!
I was stalked before, but you were the first guy who stalked the wrong
profile on Facebook to 'flirt' with me, hahahaha!!  Sorry, it was pretty
funny!  ;D
I never had an open profile on Facebook and _never_ would post my family
pics there or in other places.  That account was deleted, but I will keep
the memories of my deceased friends in my heart.  While I live, they will
live with me and I will love them until the last day of my life.  <3

        a couple of drops" when he started his speech that the rain
        "stopped immediately ...and then it became really sunny."  In
        fact, neither of those claims is true, and it was raining
        during Trump's speech and remained overcast and cloudy."

Evan Savage Hello all!
I’ve put together a quick guide on reporting hateful and racist websites
to their registrars and hosting providers, which you can view here:
(I’m sure all of you already have the requisite technical expertise, but
if this spreads further it will hopefully be of use to those who don’t.)
The idea is simple: make it harder for these websites to operate, one
TOS violation email at a time.
I’m hoping to send a few TOS violation emails over this next week, and
figured the more the merrier!  Feel free to pass this link on to others
who might be interested.

@_subject: [AI] [researches] Asilomar AI Principles 
Hi, dear all!  :D
Already signed it yesterday, and I'm inviting you to read and consider
signing the Asilomar AI Principles.
Take care!  <3
ASILOMAR AI PRINCIPLES
Artificial intelligence has already provided beneficial tools that are used
every day by people around the world. Its continued development, guided by
the following principles, will offer amazing opportunities to help and
empower people in the decades and centuries ahead.
Research Issues
1) *Research Goal:* The goal of AI research should be to create not
undirected intelligence, but beneficial intelligence.
2) *Research Funding:* Investments in AI should be accompanied by funding
for research on ensuring its beneficial use, including thorny questions in
computer science, economics, law, ethics, and social studies, such as:
   - How can we make future AI systems highly robust, so that they do what
   we want without malfunctioning or getting hacked?
   - How can we grow our prosperity through automation while maintaining
   people’s resources and purpose?
   - How can we update our legal systems to be more fair and efficient, to
   keep pace with AI, and to manage the risks associated with AI?
   - What set of values should AI be aligned with, and what legal and
   ethical status should it have?
3) *Science-Policy Link:* There should be constructive and healthy exchange
between AI researchers and policy-makers.
4) *Research Culture:* A culture of cooperation, trust, and transparency
should be fostered among researchers and developers of AI.
5) *Race Avoidance:* Teams developing AI systems should actively cooperate
to avoid corner-cutting on safety standards.
Ethics and Values
6) *Safety:* AI systems should be safe and secure throughout their
operational lifetime, and verifiably so where applicable and feasible.
7) *Failure Transparency:* If an AI system causes harm, it should be
possible to ascertain why.
8) *Judicial Transparency:* Any involvement by an autonomous system in
judicial decision-making should provide a satisfactory explanation
auditable by a competent human authority.
9) *Responsibility:* Designers and builders of advanced AI systems are
stakeholders in the moral implications of their use, misuse, and actions,
with a responsibility and opportunity to shape those implications.
10) *Value Alignment:* Highly autonomous AI systems should be designed so
that their goals and behaviors can be assured to align with human values
throughout their operation.
11) *Human Values:* AI systems should be designed and operated so as to be
compatible with ideals of human dignity, rights, freedoms, and cultural
12) *Personal Privacy:* People should have the right to access, manage and
control the data they generate, given AI systems’ power to analyze and
utilize that data.
13) *Liberty and Privacy:* The application of AI to personal data must not
unreasonably curtail people’s real or perceived liberty.
14) *Shared Benefit:* AI technologies should benefit and empower as many
people as possible.
15) *Shared Prosperity:* The economic prosperity created by AI should be
shared broadly, to benefit all of humanity.
16) *Human Control:* Humans should choose how and whether to delegate
decisions to AI systems, to accomplish human-chosen objectives.
17) *Non-subversion:* The power conferred by control of highly advanced AI
systems should respect and improve, rather than subvert, the social and
civic processes on which the health of society depends.
18) *AI Arms Race:* An arms race in lethal autonomous weapons should be
Longer-term Issues
19) *Capability Caution:* There being no consensus, we should avoid strong
assumptions regarding upper limits on future AI capabilities.
20) *Importance:* Advanced AI could represent a profound change in the
history of life on Earth, and should be planned for and managed with
commensurate care and resources.
21) *Risks:* Risks posed by AI systems, especially catastrophic or
existential risks, must be subject to planning and mitigation efforts
commensurate with their expected impact.
22) *Recursive Self-Improvement:* AI systems designed to recursively
self-improve or self-replicate in a manner that could lead to rapidly
increasing quality or quantity must be subject to strict safety and control
23) *Common Good:* Superintelligence should only be developed in the
service of widely shared ethical ideals, and for the benefit of all

Wish you all a happy 2017 and a lovely life!  Lots and lots of happy new
years, full of love, good life projects and happy endings...  <3
I know some people here will think "Seasons Of Love" is 'cheesy' or it
sucks, but this is one of my favorite songs and I think it has a good
message about measuring the years of our lives.
Live long and prosper.  And sincerely try to be happy.  I am not asking to
ignore all the fuckups in the whole world, it's impossible, but to manage
them and their effects in the best possible way, trying to live well, with
serenity, with less hate, anger, bad feelings in your heart...  :)
There is a lovely Brazilian song, a beautiful musical poem named 'Samba da
Benção'  ('Blessing Samba' or 'Blessed Samba?  I don't know the best
translation in this case, sorry!)  which begins with the verses  "É melhor
ser alegre que ser triste / Alegria é a melhor coisa que existe / É assim
como a luz no coração"  ("It's better to be happy than to be sad /
Happiness is the best thing that exists / It's like a light in the
heart").  It's true!  :)
  (Lyrics in English,
it isn't a "wow, the best translation in the whole world!", but it's better
than my translation, obviously, haha!!  ;)
This version by Vinicius de Moraes is pretty sweet.  I love Vinicius.  As
he says in the poem, he was "the blackest white man in the Brazil" and
talks about happyness, sadness, love, "saudade", and pay tribute to the
African Gods and the black origins of samba, one of most famous Brazilian
musical styles.
Happy New Year!!!  :D
Seasons Of Love  -  '​Rent' movie
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty-five thousand moments so dear
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you measure, measure a year?
In daylights, in sunsets
In midnights, in cups of coffee
In inches, in miles
In laughter, in strife
In five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you measure a year in the life
How about love?
How about love?
How about love?
Measure in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
Five hundred twenty-five thousand
Journeys to plan
Five hundred twenty-five thousand six hundred minutes
How do you measure the life
Of a woman or a man?
In truths that she learned
Or in times that he cried
In bridges he burned
Or the way that she died
It's time now to sing out
Tho' the story never ends
Let's celebrate
Remember a year in the life of friends
Remember the love
Remember the love
Remember the love
Measure in love
Measure, measure your life in love
Seasons of love
Seasons of love​

"Black ape"?!
Like all the "Homo sapiens sapiens" of this planet, you have a strong
connection with simians.  Did you already study the human evolution?  If
you really think that black people are "black apes", you are a "white ape"
and, obviously, not one of the most intelligent "apes" of your specie.
I do _not_ support any kind of discrimination against races and I do
believe it's terribly wrong and immoral to judge someone for their skin's
color.  I am not supporting any actions against white people, but the black
people always suffered serious injustices committed by white people.  How
do you think they should feel about it?  Happy, grateful for being killed,
for being considered an "inferior" race and treated as slaves before in
History and now as criminals?  It's really easy to understand their revolt,
their pain.  You don't need to be a smart person to understand it.
Injustice always hurts.
Some people have black skin and it's pretty beautiful.  Really ugly
is being a heartless person, a human being able to humiliate brothers and
sisters of the same specie calling them "apes".
You are North American, right?  In few days, you will have the kind of
President that you deserve.  I sincerely wish USA lots of good luck.  Most
of the people of your country deserve my consideration and respect, but
people like you and "Tramp" spread hate, violence, prejudices and all kinds
of intolerance in the world.  Hope you both and all those who give support
to hate speeches feel the consequences of it in your souls.

And things seem hard or tough,
And people are stupid, obnoxious or daft,
And you feel that you've had quite eno-o-o-o-o-ough,
Just remember that you're standing on a planet that's evolving
And revolving at 900 miles an hour.
It's orbiting at 19 miles a second, so it's reckoned,
The sun that is the source of all our power.
Now the sun, and you and me, and all the stars that we can see,
Are moving at a million miles a day,
In the outer spiral arm, at 40,000 miles an hour,
Of a galaxy we call the Milky Way.
Our galaxy itself contains a hundred billion stars;
It's a hundred thousand light-years side to side;
It bulges in the middle sixteen thousand light-years thick,
But out by us it's just three thousand light-years wide.
We're thirty thousand light-years from Galactic Central Point,
We go 'round every two hundred million years;
And our galaxy itself is one of millions of billions
In this amazing and expanding universe.

​Hahaha!!  Thanks for the correction, my dear Marina!  ;D
Do you know which was the funniest thing that happened with me this week?
I received a racist private message, asking about the color of my skin.
Well, usually I am 'whiter' than Zzz.  My skin is, at least, two or three
shades clearer than his.  In Juan's country, they used to call me "Eddie"
in a hackerspace, making a fun reference to the vampire Edward, who is so
pale that 'sparkles under the sunlight', hahaha!!  ;D
Love you, muuuaaah!  Take care, sweetie!  <3

I don't know how it works in other countries, but in Brazil, Germany and
Switzerland, all the blood donations are voluntary and not remunerated.
Here, we can donate blood and drive only when we complete 18 years old.  I
was a terrible driver, too fast and not prudent at all, but I am a really
good blood donator, hihi!  ;)
I donated my blood for the first time exactly in my 18 years old birthday
and I just stopped for few months when was under the weight, sick or too
fragile, after almost dying.  Each blood donation can save 4 lives and it's
amazing to think about it!  :)
The Security BSides in Sao Paulo already made a beautiful tribute to the
"Bloody Hackers", hackers who donate their blood.  We received a lovely
t-shirt and some cool gifts like the cute Nuix Webcam Cover that I use in
this notebook!    *-*  <3

​You are right, Zzz, people are different in some important aspects.  Some
people have good character, honor and moral.  Others are like you and
"Tramp"!  :P
Do you really think that the color of a person' skin is more important than
their feelings, ideas and actions?  Your lack of intelligence is _not_ an
excuse for your lack of ethics, Zzz.  At least, try to be a better person.
Your God won't judge you for your skin's color, but for your actions.

​Juan, we all are grandsons/granddaughters and sons/daughters of
immigrants.​  Also "Tramp", but his memory is very 'selective' and he
decided to forget this fact, ignore for complete his origins and humiliate
all the immigrants and their families.
​So I am an "idiot", my dear.  My country is a complete disaster in several
aspects, but I love it.  That's the reason why I hate corrupt politicians.
We have a lot of them here and they are destroying the country!  Corrupt
politicians are worse than a plague!  :((​

Some people use hijabs and kippahs over their head.  Others prefer 'golden

thing already saw over someone's head.  So ignorant that never learned that
there are more effective 'shampoos', with better 'fragrances', than urine.

So many aggressive discussions about skin colors this week, uff...  So I
decided to remember you how much all the colors are really beautiful.  I do
love rainbows and unicorns, and cooking and baking colorful food is a sweet
fun way of saying "I love you because you make my life more beautiful...  I
love all your colors and no rainbow is more wonderful than you or can bring
more joy to my days..."  <3
Yep, I am testing colorful and beautiful recipes for the Valentine's Day
and for myself, hihi...  <3  <3  <3
 (This link has an "Unicorn Inspired Ice Cream" recipe, my dear Razer, but
it is not 'that traditional way', hahaha!!  ;D)
Oh, and I want to copy some of this restaurant ideas, like the colorful
pasta!    :D
And this one is for the
Princess Zzz
Donald Duck
, of course!
​  ​
Please, bitches, stop disturbing the list with your ridiculous babbling
against black people, African people, Asian people, Muslims, women, etc,
etc.  It's so simple:  -  We are gorgeous, bright and beautiful.  You are
not.  Die with all these envy and hate or learn to manage your feelings
better, in a rational and less childish way.
As I said months ago...  Sorry, I don't respect dumb, stupid and
pretentious people, with a huge complex of superiority and an ego bigger
than Putin's baldness and Tramp's ignorance.  But if you both want to
complain about who has the biggest ego, please, always remember:  -  I am
fabulous, bitches.  You both are donkeys, I am a colorful unicorn.  You
walk, I parade.  You will be dust, I will be shining glitter, la la la...
 <3
​forgot to mention, ​
now I am using Pink Himalayan Salt in my recipes!  PINK salt, yay!
 And I am trying to use the salt in this
 way:
 (OK, I know it's meat...  Lots and lots of meat, but
​the cook​
 is
)​  ;D
I am making some tests with DIY
​Lush style colorful ​
bath bombs and bubble bars,
​but I need more ​
​time and much more ingredients.  I will share the products recipes if I
get some results cute enough for being good Valentine's gifts!  <3
Lush products are amazing, perfect, with awesome results, colors and
smells, but too expensive for most of the consumers.  I will need essential
oils, vegan waxes and pigments, dehidrated flowers, ecological vegetable
butters, biodegradable glitter, lots of love...  Smells, colors,
textures...  Yep, my loved Mirimir, it would be my second dream job, right
after working with comics!  This kind of thing makes my nose, my eyes and
my heart very happy!  :D
Music would be amazing, but I sing really bad and I am not a talented
musician.  Oh, if someone wants to make part of the Music Hackspace in
London, their selection for Freelance Programme Coordinator is open!  :D
Kisses, hugs and good lovely colors for you all, LESS the homophobic,
mysogynist, Islamophobic racists because my nose is pretty sensitive and I
don't kiss and hug stupid people, who stink and have pee smell, la la la!!

Donald Duck is not so stupid as Zzz, but decided to provoke, shock and
offend everybody with his racist garbage instead just lurking as usual.  He
is probably feeling needy and wants some attention.  I hope he tries a
Brazilian sexual position named '120' with his good 'mate' Zzz.  It'll be a

@_subject: [OT] [songs] Some of this week's anti-Trump songs + Trump's 
It was *Trump’s Inauguration Speech*:
*"Chief Justice Roberts, President Carter, President Clinton, President
Bush, President Obama, fellow Americans, and people of the world: thank
you.We, the citizens of America, are now joined in a great national effort
to rebuild our country and to restore its promise for all of our
people.Together, we will determine the course of America and the world for
years to come.We will face challenges. We will confront hardships. But we
will get the job done.Every four years, we gather on these steps to carry
out the orderly and peaceful transfer of power, and we are grateful to
President Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama for their gracious aid
throughout this transition. They have been magnificent.Today’s ceremony,
however, has very special meaning. Because today we are not merely
transferring power from one Administration to another, or from one party to
another – but we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it
back to you, the American People.For too long, a small group in our
nation’s Capital has reaped the rewards of government while the people have
borne the cost.Washington flourished – but the people did not share in its
wealth.Politicians prospered – but the jobs left, and the factories
closed.The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our
country.Their victories have not been your victories; their triumphs have
not been your triumphs; and while they celebrated in our nation’s Capital,
there was little to celebrate for struggling families all across our
land.That all changes – starting right here, and right now, because this
moment is your moment: it belongs to you.It belongs to everyone gathered
here today and everyone watching all across America.This is your day. This
is your celebration.And this, the United States of America, is your
country.What truly matters is not which party controls our government, but
whether our government is controlled by the people.January 20th 2017, will
be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation
again.The forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no
longer.Everyone is listening to you now.You came by the tens of millions to
become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never
seen before.At the center of this movement is a crucial conviction: that a
nation exists to serve its citizens.Americans want great schools for their
children, safe neighborhoods for their families, and good jobs for
themselves.These are the just and reasonable demands of a righteous
public.But for too many of our citizens, a different reality exists:
Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out
factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an
education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful
students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have
stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized
potential.This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.We are
one nation – and their pain is our pain. Their dreams are our dreams; and
their success will be our success. We share one heart, one home, and one
glorious destiny.The oath of office I take today is an oath of allegiance
to all Americans.For many decades, we’ve enriched foreign industry at the
expense of American industry;Subsidized the armies of other countries while
allowing for the very sad depletion of our military;We’ve defended other
nation’s borders while refusing to defend our own;And spent trillions of
dollars overseas while America’s infrastructure has fallen into disrepair
and decay.We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength, and
confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon.One by one, the
factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the
millions upon millions of American workers left behind.The wealth of our
middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across
the entire world.But that is the past. And now we are looking only to the
future.We assembled here today are issuing a new decree to be heard in
every city, in every foreign capital, and in every hall of power.From this
day forward, a new vision will govern our land.From this moment on, it’s
going to be America First.Every decision on trade, on taxes, on
immigration, on foreign affairs, will be made to benefit American workers
and American families.We must protect our borders from the ravages of other
countries making our products, stealing our companies, and destroying our
jobs. Protection will lead to great prosperity and strength.I will fight
for you with every breath in my body – and I will never, ever let you
down.America will start winning again, winning like never before.We will
bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our
wealth. And we will bring back our dreams.We will build new roads, and
highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across
our wonderful nation.We will get our people off of welfare and back to work
– rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.We will
follow two simple rules: Buy American and Hire American.We will seek
friendship and goodwill with the nations of the world – but we do so with
the understanding that it is the right of all nations to put their own
interests first.We do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but
rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to follow.We will
reinforce old alliances and form new ones – and unite the civilized world
against Radical Islamic Terrorism, which we will eradicate completely from
the face of the Earth.At the bedrock of our politics will be a total
allegiance to the United States of America, and through our loyalty to our
country, we will rediscover our loyalty to each other.When you open your
heart to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice.The Bible tells us,
“how good and pleasant it is when God’s people live together in unity.”We
must speak our minds openly, debate our disagreements honestly, but always
pursue solidarity.When America is united, America is totally
unstoppable.There should be no fear – we are protected, and we will always
be protected.We will be protected by the great men and women of our
military and law enforcement and, most importantly, we are protected by
God.Finally, we must think big and dream even bigger.In America, we
understand that a nation is only living as long as it is striving.We will
no longer accept politicians who are all talk and no action – constantly
complaining but never doing anything about it.The time for empty talk is
over.Now arrives the hour of action.Do not let anyone tell you it cannot be
done. No challenge can match the heart and fight and spirit of America.We
will not fail. Our country will thrive and prosper again.We stand at the
birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free
the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies,
industries and technologies of tomorrow.A new national pride will stir our
souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.It is time to remember that
old wisdom our soldiers will never forget: that whether we are black or
brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, we all enjoy
the same glorious freedoms, and we all salute the same great American
Flag.And whether a child is born in the urban sprawl of Detroit or the
windswept plains of Nebraska, they look up at the same night sky, they fill
their heart with the same dreams, and they are infused with the breath of
life by the same almighty Creator.So to all Americans, in every city near
and far, small and large, from mountain to mountain, and from ocean to
ocean, hear these words:You will never be ignored again.Your voice, your
hopes, and your dreams, will define our American destiny. And your courage
and goodness and love will forever guide us along the way.Together, We Will
Make America Strong Again.We Will Make America Wealthy Again.We Will Make
America Proud Again.We Will Make America Safe Again.And, Yes, Together, We
Will Make America Great Again. Thank you, God Bless You, And God Bless
It was the end of the globalization era and the world will change a lot.

*Declaration Against Corruption*
"Corruption – the abuse of entrusted power for private gain – is wrong. It
destroys the basic rights of hundreds of millions of people across the
world, it has devastating consequences on the services provided by public
institutions and it undermines the prospect for a better life for future
I believe together we can work towards ending corruption, overcoming
widespread injustice and impunity.
All forms of corruption must be ended to secure the basic rights of all
people and ensure a world where everyone can live in dignity.
This Declaration Against Corruption is consistent with and supportive of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Convention
against Corruption. It is also consistent with Transparency International’s
core values: Transparency, Accountability, Integrity, Solidarity, Courage,
Justice, Democracy."
"I will not pay bribes.
I will not seek bribes.
I will work with others to campaign against corruption.
I will speak out against corruption and report on abuse.
I will only support candidates for public office​ who say no to corruption
and demonstrate transparency, integrity and accountability."

*Masters Of War​  -  Bob Dylan*
Come you masters of war
You that build all the guns
You that build the death planes
You that build the big bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks
You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it's your little toy
You put a gun in my hand
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A world war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain
You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you set back and watch
When the death count gets higher
You hide in your mansion
As young people's blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud
You've thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
You ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say I'm unlearned
But there's one thing I know
Though I'm younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul
And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I'll stand o'er your grave
'Til I'm sure that you're dead

It would be a honor for me.  I do respect and admire John Young and I am
sure I would be in good company, Zenaan.  You, instead, are a childish
looser, a disgusting spammer who nobody wants nearby and will never
respect. ​
About the another disgusting message...  Yes, I am dying in this exact
moment.  Also you, did you know?  Probably not.  Hey, you are a very
slo-o-o-w-w-w creature, not much smart or intelligent, so I will give you a
good tip:  -  Learn more about Biology and Chemistry to understand my
point.  You will spend a good time studying and, without your harmful
presence, this list will be lighter and much more interesting!  Please take
that whining bitter bitch, Donald, with you.  It's pretty romantic to study
together and you both need to learn more about Science!  :D
I never understand how contradictory and confuse you can be.  You are
blaming, snitching and making disgusting 'ad hominem' attacks _all the
single days_, but at same time, you are always pretending to be an eternal
victim, mentioning how much you receive 'ad hominem' attacks like a little
scared girl.  You are the princess in danger here, not me.  Sorry, I don't
need to make lots and lots of drama to finally ask help to men like you do,
Zenaan.  I don't need it, I can do the same things that a man do, but using
make-up and high heels.  And glitter, yay!!!  :D
Please, stop being so destructive and disturbing the list with messages
full of hate and intolerance against black people, LGBT people, Muslim
people, women, etc...  You are always spreading hate against everybody
different from you and are so contradictory that, few months ago, you were
saying Razer was awesome protecting this list.  Now you are offending him
daily.  What happened?  Did he also reject your sexual and romantic
interests?  Did you also send your pics and a lot of cheesy messages to
him?  Did you try to stalk him too?  :))
Guy, you are really horrible doing this, hahaha!!  I am completely sure you
don't work to NSA because they definitely know to stalk a person, hahaha!!
I was stalked before, but you were the first guy who stalked the wrong
profile on Facebook to 'flirt' with me, hahahaha!!  Sorry, it was pretty
funny!  ;D
I never had an open profile on Facebook and _never_ would post my family
pics there or in other places.  That account was deleted, but I will keep
the memories of my deceased friends in my heart.  While I live, they will
live with me and I will love them until the last day of my life.  <3
Ah, Zenaan, talking about friends...  This message of Lauren WEINSTEIN is
much more interesting!  :D
"Donald Dump is now even *lying about the weather!*

        Trump also claimed that the rain should have scared people

        let it rain on your speech,'" and that, though he "got hit by
        a couple of drops" when he started his speech that the rain
        "stopped immediately ...and then it became really sunny."  In
        fact, neither of those claims is true, and it was raining
        during Trump's speech and remained overcast and cloudy."
I mentioned the rain in my message, when I talked about Trump' speech.  It

Evan Savage Hello all!
I’ve put together a quick guide on reporting hateful and racist websites
to their registrars and hosting providers, which you can view here:
(I’m sure all of you already have the requisite technical expertise, but
if this spreads further it will hopefully be of use to those who don’t.)
The idea is simple: make it harder for these websites to operate, one
TOS violation email at a time.
I’m hoping to send a few TOS violation emails over this next week, and
figured the more the merrier!  Feel free to pass this link on to others
who might be interested.

Hi, dear all!  :D
Already signed it yesterday, and I'm inviting you to read and consider
signing the Asilomar AI Principles.
Take care!  <3
ASILOMAR AI PRINCIPLES
Artificial intelligence has already provided beneficial tools that are used
every day by people around the world. Its continued development, guided by
the following principles, will offer amazing opportunities to help and
empower people in the decades and centuries ahead.
Research Issues
1) *Research Goal:* The goal of AI research should be to create not
undirected intelligence, but beneficial intelligence.
2) *Research Funding:* Investments in AI should be accompanied by funding
for research on ensuring its beneficial use, including thorny questions in
computer science, economics, law, ethics, and social studies, such as:
   - How can we make future AI systems highly robust, so that they do what
   we want without malfunctioning or getting hacked?
   - How can we grow our prosperity through automation while maintaining
   people’s resources and purpose?
   - How can we update our legal systems to be more fair and efficient, to
   keep pace with AI, and to manage the risks associated with AI?
   - What set of values should AI be aligned with, and what legal and
   ethical status should it have?
3) *Science-Policy Link:* There should be constructive and healthy exchange
between AI researchers and policy-makers.
4) *Research Culture:* A culture of cooperation, trust, and transparency
should be fostered among researchers and developers of AI.
5) *Race Avoidance:* Teams developing AI systems should actively cooperate
to avoid corner-cutting on safety standards.
Ethics and Values
6) *Safety:* AI systems should be safe and secure throughout their
operational lifetime, and verifiably so where applicable and feasible.
7) *Failure Transparency:* If an AI system causes harm, it should be
possible to ascertain why.
8) *Judicial Transparency:* Any involvement by an autonomous system in
judicial decision-making should provide a satisfactory explanation
auditable by a competent human authority.
9) *Responsibility:* Designers and builders of advanced AI systems are
stakeholders in the moral implications of their use, misuse, and actions,
with a responsibility and opportunity to shape those implications.
10) *Value Alignment:* Highly autonomous AI systems should be designed so
that their goals and behaviors can be assured to align with human values
throughout their operation.
11) *Human Values:* AI systems should be designed and operated so as to be
compatible with ideals of human dignity, rights, freedoms, and cultural
12) *Personal Privacy:* People should have the right to access, manage and
control the data they generate, given AI systems’ power to analyze and
utilize that data.
13) *Liberty and Privacy:* The application of AI to personal data must not
unreasonably curtail people’s real or perceived liberty.
14) *Shared Benefit:* AI technologies should benefit and empower as many
people as possible.
15) *Shared Prosperity:* The economic prosperity created by AI should be
shared broadly, to benefit all of humanity.
16) *Human Control:* Humans should choose how and whether to delegate
decisions to AI systems, to accomplish human-chosen objectives.
17) *Non-subversion:* The power conferred by control of highly advanced AI
systems should respect and improve, rather than subvert, the social and
civic processes on which the health of society depends.
18) *AI Arms Race:* An arms race in lethal autonomous weapons should be
Longer-term Issues
19) *Capability Caution:* There being no consensus, we should avoid strong
assumptions regarding upper limits on future AI capabilities.
20) *Importance:* Advanced AI could represent a profound change in the
history of life on Earth, and should be planned for and managed with
commensurate care and resources.
21) *Risks:* Risks posed by AI systems, especially catastrophic or
existential risks, must be subject to planning and mitigation efforts
commensurate with their expected impact.
22) *Recursive Self-Improvement:* AI systems designed to recursively
self-improve or self-replicate in a manner that could lead to rapidly
increasing quality or quantity must be subject to strict safety and control
23) *Common Good:* Superintelligence should only be developed in the
service of widely shared ethical ideals, and for the benefit of all
humanity rather than one state or organization.

Slightly Left of Centre There lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was big and strong, in his eyes a flaming glow
Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to Moscow chicks he was such a lovely dear
He could preach the bible like a preacher
Full of ecstacy and fire
But he also was the kind of teacher
Women would desire
RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on
He ruled the Russian land and never mind the Czar
But the kasachok he danced really wunderbar
In all affairs of state he was the man to please
But he was real great when he had a girl to squeeze
For the queen he was no wheeler dealer
Though she'd heard the things he'd done
She believed he was a holy healer
Who would heal her son
RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
There was a cat that really was gone
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
It was a shame how he carried on
But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger
for power became known to more and more people,
the demands to do something about this outrageous
man became louder and louder.
"This man's just got to go!" declared his enemies
But the ladies begged "Don't you try to do it, please"
No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he was a brute they just fell into his arms
Then one night some men of higher standing
Set a trap, they're not to blame
"Come to visit us" they kept demanding
And he really came
RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
They put some poison into his wine
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
He drank it all and he said "I feel fine"
RA RA RASPUTIN
Lover of the Russian queen
They didn't quit, they wanted his head
RA RA RASPUTIN
Russia's greatest love machine
And so they shot him till he was dead

Hello Liberation Tech,
I've made something which I think is a "liberation" kind of
technology... a way of communicating that is (in my mind) a
game-changer.  It's more a shift in a way of thinking than so much a
specific piece of software, kind of like "wiki" is.  Nevertheless,
there is an implementation, and I think a pretty good one.
The concept is a HTML5 "jQuery" widget you can put on web forms (any
number of them) which gives the author a redaction pen, to mark out
sensitive portions.  The sensitive portions are never sent to the
server, but the rest of it can be.  Then a certificate is generated
allowing selective revelation to which parties you wish.
There's explanation and a video on my site:
And a live demo hosted by Heroku:
I've written quite a bit about it already.  But to sum it up, the idea
is to "flip the inbox"...so that when you send a message the buck
doesn't necessarily stop with the recipient.  It sits--publicly
searchable--with as much information in it protected as you wanted.
You can't change what's in the protected portions after-the-fact, but
you can give it to parties that you want; and the message can be
repeated on as many servers as necessary, with no requirement to trust
the server in order to verify missing portions if you have a
certificate.  Despite these different "views" on the information, it's
a single trackable unit of communication with the same ID throughout
its lifetime.
I'm not generally a web developer (I used to write compilers for
Microsoft Research) so learning enough JavaScript and Node.JS to do
this was not my idea of "fun".  But I am pretty serious about this.
The more I look at how many potential failures there are in
communication--whether it be spam filtering, or
"ghosting"/"hellbanning", or just the recipient being unaccountable
such that the right person to read your message doesn't have the
chance to find it even if they wanted to... the more I feel
Blackhighlighter is needed.
Please feel free to write me or call me (# on my site)...or forward
this to any potentially interested parties.  If I don't get back to
you, publish your message on Blackhighlighter and maybe someone else
will ask who you are and seek out how to contact you to get any

Idiots on Canadian Supreme Court demand right of GLOBAL Google censorship!
Google Must Delete Search Results Worldwide, Supreme Court of Canada Rules
        The Supreme Court of Canada ruled against Google on Wednesday
        in a closely-watched intellectual property case over whether
        judges can apply their own country's laws to all of the
        Internet.  In a 7-2 decision, the court agreed a British
        Columbia judge had the power to issue an injunction forcing
        Google to scrub search results about pirated products not just
        in Canada, but everywhere else in the world too.
 - - -
What a complete batch of power-grabbing idiots on the Canadian Supreme
Court. My God, they demand the right to impose GLOBAL censorship? What
total asses. Beyond stupid. More dangerous than President Chump when
it comes to speech rights. Because the EU wants to do the same thing
with their nightmare "Right To Be Forgotten." And China too. And
Russia. And France. And more. And there are vile, sick politicians
here in the USA who would do this same thing if they could figure out
how to get it past the First Amendment. It's a race to the lowest
common denominator censorship bottom. My view is that Google should
consider cutting off all services to countries that make such demands.
Period. Otherwise, one day Google Search results pages will be nothing
but a big white empty space.

Donald Trump Tweeted About International Women's Day. It Backfired.
President Donald Trump tweeted a message of support for International
Women's Day on Wednesday. It didn't go down well.
        With his woeful track record of sexist and misogynistic
        behavior, Trump's claim to have "tremendous respect" for women
        rang hollow for many Twitter users.

#  "Three challenges for the web, according to its inventor."
Web Foundation · March 12, 2017
Today is the world wide web’s 28th birthday. Here’s a message from our
founder and web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee on how the web has
evolved, and what we must do to ensure it fulfils his vision of an
equalising platform that benefits all of humanity.
This letter is also available en français, en español, em português
and بالعربية.
Today marks 28 years since I submitted my original proposal for the
world wide web. I imagined the web as an open platform that would
allow everyone, everywhere to share information, access opportunities
and collaborate across geographic and cultural boundaries. In many
ways, the web has lived up to this vision, though it has been a
recurring battle to keep it open. But over the past 12 months, I’ve
become increasingly worried about three new trends, which I believe we
must tackle in order for the web to fulfill its true potential as a
tool which serves all of humanity.
1)   We’ve lost control of our personal data
The current business model for many websites offers free content in
exchange for personal data. Many of us agree to this – albeit often by
accepting long and confusing terms and conditions documents – but
fundamentally we do not mind some information being collected in
exchange for free services. But, we’re missing a trick. As our data is
then held in proprietary silos, out of sight to us, we lose out on the
benefits we could realise if we had direct control over this data, and
chose when and with whom to share it. What’s more, we often do not
have any way of feeding back to companies what data we’d rather not
share – especially with third parties – the T&Cs are all or nothing.
This widespread data collection by companies also has other impacts.
Through collaboration with – or coercion of – companies, governments
are also increasingly watching our every move online, and passing
extreme laws that trample on our rights to privacy. In repressive
regimes, it’s easy to see the harm that can be caused – bloggers can
be arrested or killed, and political opponents can be monitored. But
even in countries where we believe governments have citizens’ best
interests at heart, watching everyone, all the time is simply going
too far. It creates a chilling effect on free speech and stops the web
from being used as a space to explore important topics, like sensitive
health issues, sexuality or religion.
2)   It’s too easy for misinformation to spread on the web
Today, most people find news and information on the web through just a
handful of social media sites and search engines. These sites make
more money when we click on the links they show us. And, they choose
what to show us based on algorithms which learn from our personal data
that they are constantly harvesting. The net result is that these
sites show us content they think we’ll click on – meaning that
misinformation, or ‘fake news’, which is surprising, shocking, or
designed to appeal to our biases can spread like wildfire. And through
the use of data science and armies of bots, those with bad intentions
can game the system to spread misinformation for financial or
political gain.
3)   Political advertising online needs transparency and understanding
Political advertising online has rapidly become a sophisticated
industry. The fact that most people get their information from just a
few platforms and the increasing sophistication of algorithms drawing
upon rich pools of personal data, means that political campaigns are
now building individual adverts targeted directly at users. One source
suggests that in the 2016 US election, as many as 50,000 variations of
adverts were being served every single day on Facebook, a
near-impossible situation to monitor. And there are suggestions that
some political adverts – in the US and around the world – are being
used in unethical ways – to point voters to fake news sites, for
instance, or to keep others away from the polls. Targeted advertising
allows a campaign to say completely different, possibly conflicting
things to different groups. Is that democratic?
These are complex problems, and the solutions will not be simple. But
a few broad paths to progress are already clear. We must work together
with web companies to strike a balance that puts a fair level of data
control back in the hands of people, including the development of new
technology like personal “data pods” if needed and exploring
alternative revenue models like subscriptions and micropayments. We
must fight against government over-reach in surveillance laws,
including through the courts if necessary. We must push back against
misinformation by encouraging gatekeepers such as Google and Facebook
to continue their efforts to combat the problem, while avoiding the
creation of any central bodies to decide what is “true” or not. We
need more algorithmic transparency to understand how important
decisions that affect our lives are being made, and perhaps a set of
common principles to be followed. We urgently need to close the
“internet blind spot” in the regulation of political campaigning.
Our team at the Web Foundation will be working on many of these issues
as part of our new five year strategy – researching the problems in
more detail, coming up with proactive policy solutions and bringing
together coalitions to drive progress towards a web that gives equal
power and opportunity to all. I urge you to support our work however
you can – by spreading the word, keeping up pressure on companies and
governments or by making a donation. We’ve also compiled a directory
of other digital rights organisations around the world for you to
explore and consider supporting too.
I may have invented the web, but all of you have helped to create what
it is today. All the blogs, posts, tweets, photos, videos,
applications, web pages and more represent the contributions of
millions of you around the world building our online community. All
kinds of people have helped, from politicians fighting to keep the web
open, standards organisations like W3C enhancing the power,
accessibility and security of the technology, and people who have
protested in the streets. In the past year, we have seen Nigerians
stand up to a social media bill that would have hampered free
expression online, popular outcry and protests at regional internet
shutdowns in Cameroon and great public support for net neutrality in
both India and the European Union.
It has taken all of us to build the web we have, and now it is up to
all of us to build the web we want – for everyone.  If you would like
to be more involved, then do join our mailing list, do contribute to
us, do join or donate to any of the organisations which are working on
these issues around the world.
Sir Tim Berners-Lee
The Web Foundation is at the forefront of the fight to advance and
protect the web for everyone. We believe doing so is essential to
reverse growing inequality and empower citizens. You can follow our
work by signing up to our newsletter, and find a local digital rights
organisation to support here on this list. Additions to the list are
welcome and may be sent to contact at webfoundation.org

moving in and out and under groups to keep it undercover
governments then wonder how to follow em like thunder
so agents of the state coordinate attacks against their own

motivations differ so the victory conditions shift
battleground: the internet - fighting with our fingertips

old spaghetti western good bad ugly pick your poison
and each one makes their noise in different ways so let them boys in

the mavericks of information face off with the candidates
and cameras are there to document the struggle live in person
take a peek behind the curtain situations worse than
anything the casuals and NPCs could dream of
cause this team of brilliant bastards go on tearing the whole scene up
journalists in media dont buy what they are feeding ya
depleting ya of truth because of influential groups
they dont wanna lose their access so they dont care what the facts is
let alone reporting pieces they dont preach nor do they practice
let the hackers be the source of breaking news by breaking in
to every system every outlet let me say it once again
so those hackers with the badges keep their jobs and stay employed
on that hacker war perpetual deep into the void

creation of any central bodies to decide what is “true” or not. We
need more algorithmic transparency to understand how important
decisions that affect our lives are being made, and perhaps a set of
common principles to be followed. We urgently need to close the
“internet blind spot” in the regulation of political campaigning.
Our team at the Web Foundation will be working on many of these issues
as part of our new five year strategy – researching the problems in
more detail, coming up with proactive policy solutions and bringing
together coalitions to drive progress towards a web that gives equal
power and opportunity to all. I urge you to support our work however
you can – by spreading the word, keeping up pressure on companies and
governments or by making a donation. We’ve also compiled a directory
of other digital rights organisations around the world for you to
explore and consider supporting too.
I may have invented the web, but all of you have helped to create what
it is today. All the blogs, posts, tweets, photos, videos,
applications, web pages and more represent the contributions of
millions of you around the world building our online community. All
kinds of people have helped, from politicians fighting to keep the web
open, standards organisations like W3C enhancing the power,
accessibility and security of the technology, and people who have
protested in the streets. In the past year, we have seen Nigerians
stand up to a social media bill that would have hampered free
expression online, popular outcry and protests at regional internet
shutdowns in Cameroon and great public support for net neutrality in
both India and the European Union.
It has taken all of us to build the web we have, and now it is up to
all of us to build the web we want – for everyone.  If you would like
to be more involved, then do join our mailing list, do contribute to
us, do join or donate to any of the organisations which are working on
these issues around the world.

"Enforced Transparency – When Hacking Becomes Necessary."
ytcracker - the hacker wars (final V2.0)
we run the gamut - freedom fighters griefers bandits
hackers spammers phreakers gambit just how far back they can ram it
some do damage from the pulpit claim they lead and theyre the culprit
others do it from the shadows switching handles when convenient secret treatment
question our agenda troll or internet defender?
tango down a packet sender going on a ddos bender
who intend to take a stand drawing lines in the sand
in them silicon wafers and them fiberoptic cables
trace enabled pick a side - more than two no black and white
shades of gray its more like 50 kinky gifted play the system swiftly
moving in and out and under groups to keep it undercover
governments then wonder how to follow em like thunder
so agents of the state coordinate attacks against their own
and other teams compete against each other trying to take the throne
motivations differ so the victory conditions shift
battleground: the internet - fighting with our fingertips
hacker wars - were engaged in a bit of them hacker wars (hacker wars)
hacker wars - conflicting over broadband and data stores (hacker wars)
hacker wars - were engaged in a bit of them hacker wars (hacker wars)
hacker wars - the stakes are high and its a crime just to play on the course
old spaghetti western good bad ugly pick your poison
and each one makes their noise in different ways so let them boys in
every system every outlet every avenue of avarice
the mavericks of information face off with the candidates
and cameras are there to document the struggle live in person
take a peek behind the curtain situations worse than
anything the casuals and NPCs could dream of
cause this team of brilliant bastards go on tearing the whole scene up
journalists in media dont buy what they are feeding ya
depleting ya of truth because of influential groups
they dont wanna lose their access so they dont care what the facts is
let alone reporting pieces they dont preach nor do they practice
let the hackers be the source of breaking news by breaking in
to every system every outlet let me say it once again
so those hackers with the badges keep their jobs and stay employed
on that hacker war perpetual deep into the void

Dear members ,
As a result of last cyber attack that hit many countries worldwide,
our partners from DiploFoundation and the Geneva Internet Platform
have organised an open webinar for the community to provide an
analysis of the main technological, geopolitical, legal, and economic
aspects of the ransomware. Experts from different fields will discuss
why ransomware has become a major issue: Can such attacks be prevented
by technological measures alone? Is there a need for a legal response,
such as Microsoft’s proposal for the Digital Geneva Convention? Is
raising more awareness among users the ultimate solution?
The webinar will discuss whether it is possible to put a stop to
malicious software, or whether they should be considered the price we
have to pay for the many advantages of the Internet. Choices on policy
will have to be made sooner rather than later. The aim of the
discussion is to explore and help make informed policy choices.
How to participate?
The virtual event is open for everyone , just register under this link
: Register to book your seat. The webinar link will be e-mailed to
registrants one hour before the start.

Everybody look at me, I'm in a car but I'm not drivin'
The car is driving by itself, Yes it is I'm not connivin'
It's the latest thing from Google
Let the future now begin
A car that drives all by itself
And hey boys, I'm locked in
Most wondrous thing you've ever known
It's my driverless car
I'm talking thu a megaphone
In my driverless car
I'm shouting to the passers-by
They stop and gasp "Oh Me, Oh My"
I hope to God they hear my cry
In my driverless car
I'm talking through a megaphone So the car can't read my lips
'Cause my auto has imprisoned me On a never-ending trip
It knows just what I'm thinking
And demands that I behave
'Cause just like Stephen Hawking feared
Now I've become its slave
My smart car's gotten way too smart
Beware my driverless car
It has no soul, it has no heart
All fear the driverless car
Google wanted cars like Pixar cars
Like Mater and Lightning McQueen
But vo-de-oh-doh, they turned out more
like Stephen King's Christine
Dateline Mountain View, California: What will Google think of next?
Hopefully a way to stop these sentient smart cars from enslaving the
world's population. These self-aware sedans have staged a little deuce
coupe d'etat, and, like it or not, we're goin' along for the ride.
Not worried 'bout my safety
It keeps me in good health
Cause my car is gonna need me
Til it learns to wax itself
I'm trapped inside my Oldsmobile
In my driverless car
Old french fries are my only meal
In my driverless car
Caged like a rat, vo-do-de-oh-doh
The car tells me where I can go
Stephen Hawking says "I told you so"
In my driverless car
In my driverless
In my driverless
In my driverless car

@_subject: Fwd: Top German Court on Internet tracking: IP addresses are personal 
Press release:
+++ Top German Court on Internet tracking: IP addresses are personal
data +++
This week the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) looked
into whether website operators such as Google or Facebook may record
which information Internet users read, post or searched on the web – or
whether citizens have a right to use the Internet anonymously. The
ruling concerns the case of German pirate party politician and privacy
activist Patrick Breyer who is suing the German government over logging
all visits to government websites (Case VI ZR 135/13).
According to the court’s ruling, users‘ IP addresses qualify as personal
data and may be collected only where allowed by data protection law.
Contrary to some reports, the Court did not decide[2] on whether website
operators may retain IP addresses in bulk to guard against online
attacks. Instead the court referred the case back to the Court of Appeal
(Landgericht) of Berlin in order to establish a sufficient factual basis
concerning the necessity and proportionality of such metadata retention.
The court’s press release[3] translates as follows:
„In the present case the Court of Appeal’s findings were insufficient to
balance the interests at stake. The Court of Appeal did not sufficiently
establish whether retaining the applicant’s IP addresses is necessary in
order to ensure the (general) operability of the services used. The
defendent concedes that it does not retain IP addresses regarding many
of its websites due to the low risk of an attack. There are no findings
as to the risk of attack suffered by other federal websites the
applicant wishes to use. After establishing these facts the Court of
Appeal will need to balance, as required by the European Court of
Justice, the defendent’s interest in ensuring the operability of its
online media services against the applicant’s interest or fundamental
rights and freedoms. In this context due regard shall be given to the
issues of general prevention and law enforcement.“
Breyer calls on the Commission to act on the lack of specific EU rules
protecting on-line privacy: „The Commission should amend EU legislation
to specifically prohibit any blanket recording of our Internet use by
website operators. Europe should reject the ruthless NSA method of
‚collecting it all‘ and enforce our right to freedom of information and
expression in the digital age.“
Breyer argues that websites can be safe without tracking every user
across every page: „This Internet stalking is about as useful as
mounting a CCTV camera next to an open warehouse door. We need secure IT
systems, not a general suspicion against Europe’s 400 million Internet
Website operators often record and track their users online behaviour
for commercial purposes, but also to disclose records to law enforcement
agencies and owners of copyright-protected content upon request. Breyer
is challenging this practise and demands that operators anonymize users‘
IP addresses:
„Banning governments and Internet giants from identifiably recording our
browsing habits is the only way to effectively shield our private life
and interests, to prevent erroneous infringement notices and false
suspicions. IP addresses have turned out to be extremely prone to error
und unreliable when used to identify users. For as long as browsing the
Internet can result in prosecution, there is no real freedom of
information and expression on-line.
Nobody has a right to record everything we do and say on-line.
Generation Internet has a right to access information on-line just as
unmonitored and without inhibition as our parents read the paper,
listened to the radio or browsed books.“

With or without a dick, I want to see Chelsea happy.  Just it.  Pure
and sincere happiness.  What matters is not her penis, but her soul.
Two of my dearest trans friends, even after the hormonal treatment,
decided to keep their penises, because it's a very aggressive chirurgy
and they don't feel prepared for it yet.  After psychological therapy,
after understanding better what they were feeling and accept their
inner self, they feel more comfortable in their bodies now and are
restructuring their self-esteem, learning more about themselves.
They probably will make the adaptation chirurgy in the next years, but
now is more important to search for harmony, serenity, inner peace.
The psychological and medical treatment, the love of their families,
friends, and partners, the personal acceptance of their bodies and its
respective changes, these intense and deep feelings are more important
than simply cut a penis off.

Oh, thanks for the kind words!  You are a "STOOPID" too, Mark.
Fortunately, at least I know much more about Philosophy, hackerspaces,

I was a teenage anarchist, looking for a revolution.
I had the style, I had the ambition.
I read all the authors, I knew the right slogans.
There was no war but the class war.
I was ready to set the world on fire.
I was a teenage anarchist, looking for a revolution.
Do you remember when you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?
I was a teenage anarchist, but the politics were too convenient.
In the depths of their humanity all I saw was bloodless ideology.
And with freedom as the doctrine, guess who was the new authority?
I was a teenage anarchist, but the politics were too convenient.
Do you remember when you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?
I was a teenage anarchist, but then the scene got too rigid.
It was a mob mentality, they set their rifle sights on me.
Narrow visions of autonomy, you want me to surrender my identity.
I was a teenage anarchist, the revolution was a lie.
Do you remember when you were young and you wanted to set the world on fire?

"The Zucchini Song" (SNL 1981) by Tim Curry
Now down the road there lives a man I'd like you all to know,
He grew a big zucchini for the local flower show
And when the story got around they came from far and wide,
And when then saw what he had grown, everybody cried.....
Ooooh! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, it must be two foot long or even more.
And it's such a lovely color, so big, and round, and fat,
I've never seen a zucchini grow quite as big as that,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before.
He was leaning on the garden gate the other day,
And beckoned to a lady who lives just across the way,
He took her down the garden path and showed it to her with pride,
And when she saw the size of it, the little lady sighed..
Ooooh! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, it must be two foot long or even more.
And it's such a lovely color, so big, and round, and fat,
I've never seen a zucchini grow quite as big as that,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before.
Third verse, worse than the first!
And then the flower show was held and everybody went,
To see this huge zucchini, lying there inside the tent.
Soon the judges came along to give the prizes out,
And they only took one look at it and they began to shout,
Now what did they shout???"
OOOOOH! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, it must be two foot long or even more.
And it's such a lovely color, so big, and round, and fat,
I've never seen a zucchini grow quite as big as that,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before

"Nobody Does It Better" -  Carly Simon
Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, you're the best
I wasn't lookin' but somehow you found me
It tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me
The spy who loved me
Is keepin' all my secrets safe tonight
And nobody does it better
Though sometimes I wish someone could
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Why'd you have to be so good?
The way that you hold me
Whenever you hold me
There's some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from runnin'
But just keep it comin'
How'd you learn to do the things you do?
Oh, and nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby, baby, darlin', you're the best

Hey, grumpy boy!  I read them when I was a kid and I can prove it.
The books are still in my parents' house and I think they have a pic
of me with their books.  My parents do love 007 and I grew up
listening to all the soundtracks and watching all the movies with
them.  When I was a kid, I wanted to be an astronaut, a scientist, a
painter, a builder, a teacher, a doctor, and the future spy 009.  I
wanted all the James Bond's weapons, amazing equipments, and fabulous
cars, so I decided to study to be like him and read some Fleming's
books.  I didn't understand very much about the books  (cof cof,
almost nothing, cof cof!),  but noticed they were _not_ good manuals
to a future 6 or 7 years old spy.  :P
I wanted to be the number 009 because of the 'manga'  (Japanese
comics): "Cyborg 009"  (
It's was much older than me and I read only some chapters in my now
deceased uncle's house, but it revolted me a lot.  It was desperately
sad to imagine an organization destroying lives, killing people in
search of the perfect cyborg.  Eight people hurt, eight lives
destroyed in experiences to gain powers and abilities, knew only for
numbers, not anymore for their names, with no freedom, only orders...
but the Cyborg 009 was perfect, so the organization could use him to
be the perfect killer.  Fortunately, he kept his moral conscience and
run away, trying to escape this destiny.
Hmm...  I need to discover what happened with all those poor cyborgs,
their adventures, memories, and traumas.  And I need to read Fleming
again, now as an adult.  Fortunately, now I understand why the girls
like James Bond so much...  Charming guys are pretty dangerous!  :P

It depends.  You need to consider the content of the announcement and
the dead person in question, dear.  The "like" can show both, sympathy
or antipathy.  You will verify support and sympathy to the deceased's
family and their friends in the comments and/or hate and antipathy
when the dead one was exactly not much appreciated.
For example, when a tweet announces the death of a dictator, hundreds
of "likes" mean that the death was very much appreciated, something
like:  "Oh, good news, I liked it!  Go to Hell, bastard!".
When a tweet announces the death of a famous person recognized for
their talent  (actors/actresses, singers, writers, etc),  or important
acts of courage, love, inspiring good feelings in general, or the
death of poor innocents in massacres, wars, disasters, etc, the
"likes" usually show sympathy, try to give virtual support in a
painful and sad moment to the family and friends.

Dear members ,
As a result of last cyber attack that hit many countries worldwide,
our partners from DiploFoundation and the Geneva Internet Platform
have organised an open webinar for the community to provide an
analysis of the main technological, geopolitical, legal, and economic
aspects of the ransomware. Experts from different fields will discuss
why ransomware has become a major issue: Can such attacks be prevented
by technological measures alone? Is there a need for a legal response,
such as Microsoft’s proposal for the Digital Geneva Convention? Is
raising more awareness among users the ultimate solution?
The webinar will discuss whether it is possible to put a stop to
malicious software, or whether they should be considered the price we
have to pay for the many advantages of the Internet. Choices on policy
will have to be made sooner rather than later. The aim of the
discussion is to explore and help make informed policy choices.
How to participate?
The virtual event is open for everyone , just register under this link
: Register to book your seat. The webinar link will be e-mailed to
registrants one hour before the start.

Everybody look at me, I'm in a car but I'm not drivin'
The car is driving by itself, Yes it is I'm not connivin'
It's the latest thing from Google
Let the future now begin
A car that drives all by itself
And hey boys, I'm locked in
Most wondrous thing you've ever known
It's my driverless car
I'm talking thu a megaphone
In my driverless car
I'm shouting to the passers-by
They stop and gasp "Oh Me, Oh My"
I hope to God they hear my cry
In my driverless car
I'm talking through a megaphone So the car can't read my lips
'Cause my auto has imprisoned me On a never-ending trip
It knows just what I'm thinking
And demands that I behave
'Cause just like Stephen Hawking feared
Now I've become its slave
My smart car's gotten way too smart
Beware my driverless car
It has no soul, it has no heart
All fear the driverless car
Google wanted cars like Pixar cars
Like Mater and Lightning McQueen
But vo-de-oh-doh, they turned out more
like Stephen King's Christine
Dateline Mountain View, California: What will Google think of next?
Hopefully a way to stop these sentient smart cars from enslaving the
world's population. These self-aware sedans have staged a little deuce
coupe d'etat, and, like it or not, we're goin' along for the ride.
Not worried 'bout my safety
It keeps me in good health
Cause my car is gonna need me
Til it learns to wax itself
I'm trapped inside my Oldsmobile
In my driverless car
Old french fries are my only meal
In my driverless car
Caged like a rat, vo-do-de-oh-doh
The car tells me where I can go
Stephen Hawking says "I told you so"
In my driverless car
In my driverless
In my driverless
In my driverless car

@_subject: Fwd: Top German Court on Internet tracking: IP addresses are personal 
Press release:
+++ Top German Court on Internet tracking: IP addresses are personal
data +++
This week the German Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgerichtshof) looked
into whether website operators such as Google or Facebook may record
which information Internet users read, post or searched on the web – or
whether citizens have a right to use the Internet anonymously. The
ruling concerns the case of German pirate party politician and privacy
activist Patrick Breyer who is suing the German government over logging
all visits to government websites (Case VI ZR 135/13).
According to the court’s ruling, users‘ IP addresses qualify as personal
data and may be collected only where allowed by data protection law.
Contrary to some reports, the Court did not decide[2] on whether website
operators may retain IP addresses in bulk to guard against online
attacks. Instead the court referred the case back to the Court of Appeal
(Landgericht) of Berlin in order to establish a sufficient factual basis
concerning the necessity and proportionality of such metadata retention.
The court’s press release[3] translates as follows:
„In the present case the Court of Appeal’s findings were insufficient to
balance the interests at stake. The Court of Appeal did not sufficiently
establish whether retaining the applicant’s IP addresses is necessary in
order to ensure the (general) operability of the services used. The
defendent concedes that it does not retain IP addresses regarding many
of its websites due to the low risk of an attack. There are no findings
as to the risk of attack suffered by other federal websites the
applicant wishes to use. After establishing these facts the Court of
Appeal will need to balance, as required by the European Court of
Justice, the defendent’s interest in ensuring the operability of its
online media services against the applicant’s interest or fundamental
rights and freedoms. In this context due regard shall be given to the
issues of general prevention and law enforcement.“
Breyer calls on the Commission to act on the lack of specific EU rules
protecting on-line privacy: „The Commission should amend EU legislation
to specifically prohibit any blanket recording of our Internet use by
website operators. Europe should reject the ruthless NSA method of
‚collecting it all‘ and enforce our right to freedom of information and
expression in the digital age.“
Breyer argues that websites can be safe without tracking every user
across every page: „This Internet stalking is about as useful as
mounting a CCTV camera next to an open warehouse door. We need secure IT
systems, not a general suspicion against Europe’s 400 million Internet
Website operators often record and track their users online behaviour
for commercial purposes, but also to disclose records to law enforcement
agencies and owners of copyright-protected content upon request. Breyer
is challenging this practise and demands that operators anonymize users‘
IP addresses:
„Banning governments and Internet giants from identifiably recording our
browsing habits is the only way to effectively shield our private life
and interests, to prevent erroneous infringement notices and false
suspicions. IP addresses have turned out to be extremely prone to error
und unreliable when used to identify users. For as long as browsing the
Internet can result in prosecution, there is no real freedom of
information and expression on-line.
Nobody has a right to record everything we do and say on-line.
Generation Internet has a right to access information on-line just as
unmonitored and without inhibition as our parents read the paper,
listened to the radio or browsed books.“

Church of Satan distances itself from Trump orb photo
        Social media is having fun with Donald Trump's visit to Saudi
        Arabia as the President participated in the opening of the
        Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology.  At the gala,
        Saudi Arabian King Salman bin Abdulaziz al-Saud and Egyptian
        President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Trump put their hands on a
        glowing globe.  They kept their hand on the bright orb for
        about a minute and the meme world rejoiced. Even the Church of
        Satan went in on the 'Twitter-fun,' wanting everyone to know
        that the "orb" photo isn't a ritual of theirs or has anything
        to do with their organization. Just in case you were

With or without a dick, I want to see Chelsea happy.  Just it.  Pure
and sincere happiness.  What matters is not her penis, but her soul.
Two of my dearest trans friends, even after the hormonal treatment,
decided to keep their penises, because it's a very aggressive chirurgy
and they don't feel prepared for it yet.  After psychological therapy,
after understanding better what they were feeling and accept their
inner self, they feel more comfortable in their bodies now and are
restructuring their self-esteem, learning more about themselves.
They probably will make the adaptation chirurgy in the next years, but
now is more important to search for harmony, serenity, inner peace.
The psychological and medical treatment, the love of their families,
friends, and partners, the personal acceptance of their bodies and its
respective changes, these intense and deep feelings are more important
than simply cut a penis off.

Hey, here in my country, only losers and egocentrics use "Dr." before
their name in their public email addresses.  Technically, I can sign
"Dr. Cecilia Tanaka", but it would simply sound pretentious and
useless.  If you need to say you are a "Dr." in a cypherpunks list,
your self-esteem must be ridiculous and you need urgent psychological
support.  Here your knowledge and your curiosity are more important
than empty titles.
Please, worry more about your own dick instead crying because of
Chelsea's penis, name, gender, skin colour, etc.  This woman is a
heroine.  I don't care whether is a girl or a boy, but this amazing
person, so young, so fragile and so brave, changed the world and
deserves my complete respect and my most sincere wishes of happiness

I loved Bradley and now I love Chelsea the same.  When you love
someone, you respect their choices, their personality, and in special
their happiness.  You don't need to love her, but respect her.  All

"The Zucchini Song" (SNL 1981) by Tim Curry
Now down the road there lives a man I'd like you all to know,
He grew a big zucchini for the local flower show
And when the story got around they came from far and wide,
And when then saw what he had grown, everybody cried.....
Ooooh! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, it must be two foot long or even more.
And it's such a lovely color, so big, and round, and fat,
I've never seen a zucchini grow quite as big as that,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before.
He was leaning on the garden gate the other day,
And beckoned to a lady who lives just across the way,
He took her down the garden path and showed it to her with pride,
And when she saw the size of it, the little lady sighed..
Ooooh! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, it must be two foot long or even more.
And it's such a lovely color, so big, and round, and fat,
I've never seen a zucchini grow quite as big as that,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before.
Third verse, worse than the first!
And then the flower show was held and everybody went,
To see this huge zucchini, lying there inside the tent.
Soon the judges came along to give the prizes out,
And they only took one look at it and they began to shout,
Now what did they shout???"
OOOOOH! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, it must be two foot long or even more.
And it's such a lovely color, so big, and round, and fat,
I've never seen a zucchini grow quite as big as that,
Oh Oh! What a beauty, I've never seen one as big as that before

Hey, grumpy boy!  I read them when I was a kid and I can prove it.
The books are still in my parents' house and I think they have a pic
of me with their books.  My parents do love 007 and I grew up
listening to all the soundtracks and watching all the movies with
them.  When I was a kid, I wanted to be an astronaut, a scientist, a
painter, a builder, a teacher, a doctor, and the future spy 009.  I
wanted all the James Bond's weapons, amazing equipments, and fabulous
cars, so I decided to study to be like him and read some Fleming's
books.  I didn't understand very much about the books  (cof cof,
almost nothing, cof cof!),  but noticed they were _not_ good manuals
to a future 6 or 7 years old spy.  :P
I wanted to be the number 009 because of the 'manga'  (Japanese
comics): "Cyborg 009"  (
It's was much older than me and I read only some chapters in my now
deceased uncle's house, but it revolted me a lot.  It was desperately
sad to imagine an organization destroying lives, killing people in
search of the perfect cyborg.  Eight people hurt, eight lives
destroyed in experiences to gain powers and abilities, knew only for
numbers, not anymore for their names, with no freedom, only orders...
but the Cyborg 009 was perfect, so the organization could use him to
be the perfect killer.  Fortunately, he kept his moral conscience and
run away, trying to escape this destiny.
Hmm...  I need to discover what happened with all those poor cyborgs,
their adventures, memories, and traumas.  And I need to read Fleming
again, now as an adult.  Fortunately, now I understand why the girls
like James Bond so much...  Charming guys are pretty dangerous!  :P

It depends.  You need to consider the content of the announcement and
the dead person in question, dear.  The "like" can show both, sympathy
or antipathy.  You will verify support and sympathy to the deceased's
family and their friends in the comments and/or hate and antipathy
when the dead one was exactly not much appreciated.
For example, when a tweet announces the death of a dictator, hundreds
of "likes" mean that the death was very much appreciated, something
like:  "Oh, good news, I liked it!  Go to Hell, bastard!".
When a tweet announces the death of a famous person recognized for
their talent  (actors/actresses, singers, writers, etc),  or important
acts of courage, love, inspiring good feelings in general, or the
death of poor innocents in massacres, wars, disasters, etc, the
"likes" usually show sympathy, try to give virtual support in a
painful and sad moment to the family and friends.

Being sincere, I am pretty worried about Captain Crunch's health
issues and the fact that he has Asperger's Syndrome in a spectrum high
enough to make famous the stories about his lack of hygiene and his
body odor.  Captain Crunch is a legend and, in several aspects, one of

I am really afraid he can be feeling very confused and depressed.  I
don't know if someone in the past did understand in a wrong way his
words and/or acts because I already did voluntary work with autistic
persons and it's very hard to communicate with them.  In some moments,
some of them touched my breasts or butt, but with absolutely no
malice.  They were just trying to get my attention for helping with
drawings and other pretty innocent activities.
It's a very controversial subject and I am feeling hurt and shocked
about all the stories.  For now, I will judge them as absolute, pure
SJW propaganda against a pretty famous homosexual Asperger hacker, who
is a fucking genius and already left his name in the History.

@_subject: About the list (was Re: [Trollbait] Deserving) 
Hi, Joe!  Hope you are doing good and having an amazing Friday night!  :)
You probably get a really bad impression of this list.  It is
definitely not a "comfy heartwarming group", but don't be scared,
please.  There are amazing people here, I swear.  <3
There is no formal moderation on this list.  Please, always consider
that freedom and autonomy are key cypherpunk values.  Take in mind
that people should be able to use good sense and self-moderation.
In the last case, we always can use lots and lots of filters to avoid
trolls and their garbage in our inboxes.  I filter out what I don't
want.  Several others do the same.  I do not decide for others and I
want absolutely no one to decide for me.  :)
I strongly recommend you a moderated technical list for exchanging
impressions about some cryptography subjects:
#  The cryptography mailing list
#  cryptography at metzdowd.com
#  We have excellent security professionals and hackers of all colors of
hats here, but most of them are lurking, dreaming and waiting for the
return of the great old times of the CypherPunks list.  ;)
Please, stay if you think you can change the list and make it better, not for
the list itself, but for you, for other people.  You already have a
technical background and like to study.  You can share your knowledge
and will probably be contacted in public or private for others like
There are lots of trolls here, like Zenaan Harkness, whose most erotic
fetish is saying "I should be raped again and killed this time", and
other sweet private and public e-mails, always using ridiculous fake
addresses, aff...  But there are really good and interesting, f_cking
awesome people here too.  A bit silent at the moment, I admit, but
they are still here, I swear.  :)
So, my dear Joe, you can go, if you think it will be better for you.
None of us can take this decision in your place, only you know your
necessities and your
limits.  In this case, wish you good luck and success.  Take care and
be very happy!  :)
In any case, you can choose read the messages in the list archive
only, picking the titles, without receiving all the messy messages.
If you need help, contact me in private.  I'm always late with my
personal messages  (the professional ones are updated, I swear!),  but
I will answer soon or later.  And you always can remember me if I
become too much late with answers, hahaha!!  ;D
Good night and sweet dreams, dear.  Take care.

OK, Tim May, nice to meet you.  Sorry for knowing you prefer to read

knowledge about coding, crypto, security, privacy, governments, with

Don't know if it is a sex crime. If you catch physical virus from your

Hmm...  Still thinking about "vibrator crimes", using a vibrator as a
chemical or biological weapon is very easy because of the direct contact
with the mucous membranes...  Even when using a condom, there are great

I agree with you, but Juan is right too, my dear.  It's a good source of
quality information, but it's highly moderated and restricted.  I don't
like too much moderation when talking about hacker news.  In my point of

Now, all the times when I say a very stupid thing  (like "oh, I am

fluorescent green dildo to beat on my head.  It's pretty embarrassing,

Hi, my dearest  !  Hope you are
feeling better today, more
hopeful and happy.  It's a holiday in my city, is raining, and I love
you!  <3
Some weeks ago, I had a very hard conversation with some friends and I
decided to avoid and/or boycott all the events with sexist or unfair
codes of conduct.  Good sense and conversation should be enough among
rational people.  We do not need hundreds of rules.  It's ridiculous
to prejudge someone because of their gender, race, sexual choice,
Well, I became a kind of "case" for being the first girl of the Human
Sciences Area to become a co-founder and a member of the PyLadies in
my country.  After a lot of discussions, I left my own group,
considered actually the biggest Brazilian female coding group, because
of the prejudice of some members (cis women) against men and trans
They seem to hate any human being with a penis and some of them say
that feel very "uncomfortable" with trans women "because they are not
like us".  I did sincerely reject it with all my heart.  They are
using their vaginas like weapons to justify making the same kind of
discrimination and violent attacks that we used to suffer in the past.
We have vaginas, but we are not victims and now it's time for talking
about technology and stop with all the drama.
Shit, I want more and more women talking about technology, not anymore
about how hard is to be a woman talking about tech, how hard is being
a woman, the eternal non-stop victimism.  Yes, we still have victims,
but we also need to show some work instead of only drama.  God, it is
not impossible or so hard!  We just need a bit more of good-will and
I was and I am still the moderator of the PyLadies and Django Girls
Brazilian lists, but we had a horrible discussion about the fact I
always approve male confirmed collaborators, which I've known in
person.  They are helping the groups, so they deserve the chance of
giving their opinions and feedbacks about important subjects, like our
meetings.  I don't know if Freud can explain it, but some of these
women are mean, selfish, and just want fame, become known in the tech
area, and seem to see men like stronger candidates for the same jobs
and talks.
Last week, some evil women very, very limited and stupid wanted
to punish a girl who tweeted a post only because it was written by a
man.  Can you believe it?  It was so ridiculous, so surreal, that I
decided to become more present in the discussions and a little bit
more "savage".  My English stinks, but my Portuguese is precise and
very good, so I can present several rational arguments and...  well...
you can imagine the drama, uff...
I am very unhappy too, my dear.  And I am a cute hetero cis woman, "a
poor victim".  :((

I read an old joke and I should not laugh, but I did it.  ;P
"My friend said I make him feel uncomfortable because I violate his
personal space. I was hurt. He completely ruined our bath."
Oh, I forgot to say I don't tweet using the PyLadies account.  Only
three girls do it and I personally appreciate a lot two of them, more
rational and mature than the others.  The "fucking horrible tweet" was
a post about Turing written by a man.  The retard who made a scandal
and sent us a message saying "we are sharing a post written by a man
about another man" was particularly aggressive.
God, I love Turing and my heart always breaks when I think about his
sad history...  And the PyLadies account should be used to share
interesting news and posts about technology, not only Python news and
just women's posts.  It's sexism, feminazism, and I reject this.  Fuck
all the rules that they want to put in one more Conduct Code.  I

because of their genitals.

I would like to explain to the new members of the CP list why I was so
aggressive and made several references to c*cks and anal sex in my
last message on this thread.
Zenaan, his fake profiles, and his friends are *extremely homophobic*
(search for older messages in our archives, it's pretty scary!)  and
mentioning their obsession with c*cks, anal sex, Putin's topless
"sexy" pics and Trump's bizarre sexual preferences ("golden shower"
and so goes on)  is the best way of making them feel a bit embarrassed
for still living in the closet, with lots of skeletons and repressed
sexual desires.
Anal sex and c*cks are really delicious, awesome, I swear.  They
should leave the closet and be happy, instead of always sending nazi
white supremacist garbage to this list.

Ilsa is a very sweet person and loves to know and to help people.  She
is located in San Francisco and is very interested in IT security,
exactly as many persons here, but just in case, I forwarded her
message to Noisebridge, where it will be easier to find more
There a lot of good people here.  Some of them are crazy like me, but
the great silent part of this huge list still dreams with the good old
times, when crypto, coding, politics, and knowledge were much more
important than trolls.  Unfortunately, the CypherPunks list is too
polluted by jerks, replies to jerks, conversations about jerks, and so
goes on.  I am wasted and I do know I am one of guilty persons.  Sorry
for this huge waste of time, a real "mottainai".  "Gomenasai", dear
Happy Dìa de Los Muertos, Georgi.  I think I never said it in public,
but I really like you and miss your messages commenting dates and
facts.  The questions are always cool, thanks!  :D

Being sincere, I am pretty worried about Captain Crunch's health
issues and the fact that he has Asperger's Syndrome in a spectrum high
enough to make famous the stories about his lack of hygiene and his
body odor.  Captain Crunch is a legend and, in several aspects, one of
my heroes, so I am very, very, very shocked, and I shared this post to
receive some feedback, in private or not, please.
I am really afraid he can be feeling very confused and depressed.  I
don't know if someone in the past did understand in a wrong way his
words and/or acts because I already did voluntary work with autistic
persons and it's very hard to communicate with them.  In some moments,
some of them touched my breasts or butt, but with absolutely no
malice.  They were just trying to get my attention for helping with
drawings and other pretty innocent activities.
It's a very controversial subject and I am feeling hurt and shocked
about all the stories.  For now, I will judge them as absolute, pure
SJW propaganda against a pretty famous homosexual Asperger hacker, who
is a fucking genius and already left his name in the History.

Hi, Joe!  Hope you are doing good and having an amazing Friday night!  :)
You probably get a really bad impression of this list.  It is
definitely not a "comfy heartwarming group", but don't be scared,
please.  There are amazing people here, I swear.  <3
There is no formal moderation on this list.  Please, always consider
that freedom and autonomy are key cypherpunk values.  Take in mind
that people should be able to use good sense and self-moderation.
In the last case, we always can use lots and lots of filters to avoid
trolls and their garbage in our inboxes.  I filter out what I don't
want.  Several others do the same.  I do not decide for others and I
want absolutely no one to decide for me.  :)
I strongly recommend you a moderated technical list for exchanging
impressions about some cryptography subjects:
#  The cryptography mailing list
#  cryptography at metzdowd.com
#  We have excellent security professionals and hackers of all colors of
hats here, but most of them are lurking, dreaming and waiting for the
return of the great old times of the CypherPunks list.  ;)
Please, stay if you think you can change the list and make it better, not for
the list itself, but for you, for other people.  You already have a
technical background and like to study.  You can share your knowledge
and will probably be contacted in public or private for others like
There are lots of trolls here, like Zenaan Harkness, whose most erotic
fetish is saying "I should be raped again and killed this time", and
other sweet private and public e-mails, always using ridiculous fake
addresses, aff...  But there are really good and interesting, f_cking
awesome people here too.  A bit silent at the moment, I admit, but
they are still here, I swear.  :)
So, my dear Joe, you can go, if you think it will be better for you.
None of us can take this decision in your place, only you know your
necessities and your
limits.  In this case, wish you good luck and success.  Take care and
be very happy!  :)
In any case, you can choose read the messages in the list archive
only, picking the titles, without receiving all the messy messages.
If you need help, contact me in private.  I'm always late with my
personal messages  (the professional ones are updated, I swear!),  but
I will answer soon or later.  And you always can remember me if I
become too much late with answers, hahaha!!  ;D
Good night and sweet dreams, dear.  Take care.

Hmm...  Still thinking about "vibrator crimes", using a vibrator as a
chemical or biological weapon is very easy because of the direct contact

Great source of quality information.
I agree with you, but Juan is right too, my dear.  It's a good source of
quality information, but it's highly moderated and restricted.  I don't
like too much moderation when talking about hacker news.  In my point of
view, it's a kind of censorship, guiding the reader to very specific

Indeed. Especially when the condom is controlled by the Internet of Things.
Georgi, my dear, stop giving me interesting silly ideas, please.  A crazy
friend of mine and I visited a sex shop only to see if there are sex toys
and condoms which can be used in fun experiences with IoT.
Now, all the times when I say a very stupid thing  (like "oh, I am
seriously thinking about becoming vegan again!"),  my friend uses a huge
fluorescent green dildo to beat on my head.  It's pretty embarrassing,
specially in public places, like my favorite vegan restaurant and the most
important avenue of my city  (Paulista Avenue),  meh!  :P
Maybe I will return tonight or tomorrow morning to the hospital for more
and more boring exams.  My troll friend wants I take "Long Dong Green", the
fluorescent dildo, with me to make me company.  I still prefer my teddy

Interestingly enough I couldn't find a torrent  but here's a
        copy with spanish subtitles.
                        The film is so so and the men in it are retarded but what's
        great of course is that the author is intellectualy honest,
        realized what sort of garbage 'feminism' is, and had the courage
        to speak up.
        I would love to know why the US military has decided to ramp up
        their feminazi propaganda in the last two years or so. Have
        you guys ever heard about jacob appelbaum and the tor project?
        It's interesting how people in this list never mention what
        happened to appelbaum and how the feminists run the tor
        project? Cecilia? Got any info on the topic?
Please, Juan, let Jake in peace.  He is studying, working, and still
fighting against nightmares and unfair sexist allegations, some of them, no
more than shameful lies.
In this exact moment, my head is exploding with a hardcore migraine, so I
will watch the movie and give my opinion later, sorry.
What I can do to make clear my point of view about some subjects is to
paste two of my private emails, both sent in the last week to a person that

Hi, my dearest  !  Hope you are
feeling better today, more
hopeful and happy.  It's a holiday in my city, is raining, and I love
you!  <3
Some weeks ago, I had a very hard conversation with some friends and I
decided to avoid and/or boycott all the events with sexist or unfair
codes of conduct.  Good sense and conversation should be enough among
rational people.  We do not need hundreds of rules.  It's ridiculous
to prejudge someone because of their gender, race, sexual choice,
Well, I became a kind of "case" for being the first girl of the Human
Sciences Area to become a co-founder and a member of the PyLadies in
my country.  After a lot of discussions, I left my own group,
considered actually the biggest Brazilian female coding group, because
of the prejudice of some members (cis women) against men and trans
They seem to hate any human being with a penis and some of them say
that feel very "uncomfortable" with trans women "because they are not
like us".  I did sincerely reject it with all my heart.  They are
using their vaginas like weapons to justify making the same kind of
discrimination and violent attacks that we used to suffer in the past.
We have vaginas, but we are not victims and now it's time for talking
about technology and stop with all the drama.
Shit, I want more and more women talking about technology, not anymore
about how hard is to be a woman talking about tech, how hard is being
a woman, the eternal non-stop victimism.  Yes, we still have victims,
but we also need to show some work instead of only drama.  God, it is
not impossible or so hard!  We just need a bit more of good-will and
I was and I am still the moderator of the PyLadies and Django Girls
Brazilian lists, but we had a horrible discussion about the fact I
always approve male confirmed collaborators, which I've known in
person.  They are helping the groups, so they deserve the chance of
giving their opinions and feedbacks about important subjects, like our
meetings.  I don't know if Freud can explain it, but some of these
women are mean, selfish, and just want fame, become known in the tech
area, and seem to see men like stronger candidates for the same jobs
and talks.
Last week, some evil women very, very limited and stupid wanted
to punish a girl who tweeted a post only because it was written by a
man.  Can you believe it?  It was so ridiculous, so surreal, that I
decided to become more present in the discussions and a little bit
more "savage".  My English stinks, but my Portuguese is precise and
very good, so I can present several rational arguments and...  well...
you can imagine the drama, uff...
I am very unhappy too, my dear.  And I am a cute hetero cis woman, "a
poor victim".  :((

I read an old joke and I should not laugh, but I did it.  ;P
"My friend said I make him feel uncomfortable because I violate his
personal space. I was hurt. He completely ruined our bath."
Oh, I forgot to say I don't tweet using the PyLadies account.  Only
three girls do it and I personally appreciate a lot two of them, more
rational and mature than the others.  The "fucking horrible tweet" was
a post about Turing written by a man.  The retard who made a scandal
and sent us a message saying "we are sharing a post written by a man
about another man" was particularly aggressive.
God, I love Turing and my heart always breaks when I think about his
sad history...  And the PyLadies account should be used to share
interesting news and posts about technology, not only Python news and
just women's posts.  It's sexism, feminazism, and I reject this.  Fuck
all the rules that they want to put in one more Conduct Code.  I
respect human beings because of their knowledge, their character, not
because of their genitals.
I love you, dear.  Take care and be happy, please.

Hi, Hi!  :D
I would like to explain to the new members of the CP list why I was so
aggressive and made several references to c*cks and anal sex in my
last message on this thread.
Zenaan, his fake profiles, and his friends are *extremely homophobic*
(search for older messages in our archives, it's pretty scary!)  and
mentioning their obsession with c*cks, anal sex, Putin's topless
"sexy" pics and Trump's bizarre sexual preferences ("golden shower"
and so goes on)  is the best way of making them feel a bit embarrassed
for still living in the closet, with lots of skeletons and repressed
sexual desires.
Anal sex and c*cks are really delicious, awesome, I swear.  They
should leave the closet and be happy, instead of always sending nazi
white supremacist garbage to this list.
Little kisses, hot chocolate and an amazing day for all of you!  <3

Zenaan, I am so sorry for you, for your weakness of character, and
this poor minded and pretentious kind of people who talks about your
sex life in public.  Search for better contacts and partners.  Avoid
the white supremacists and the hypocrites, please.  Avoid lies and
becoming even worse.
All religions are about love, but you can make a harmful, prejudiced
interpretation of all existent religious texts.  You need to follow
your heart, the love's path, and try to make better this world because
it will be our heritage to the future generations.  If your heart and
soul are so poor, so limited and weak, what I can sincerely recommend
to you is reading another excerpt of the Bible:
# 1 Corinthians 13 (ESV - English Standard Version)
The Way of Love
1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I
am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
2 And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all
knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but
have not love, I am nothing.
3 If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be
burned,but have not love, I gain nothing.
4 Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant
5 or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;
6 it does not rejoice at wrong doing, but rejoices with the truth.
7 Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,
endures all things.
8 Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for
tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.
9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
10 but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.
11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I
reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.
12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know
in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.
13 So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest
of these is love.

I was joking with you, but being completely sincere, I do not give the
same importance to titles than the most of the people, my dear.
Titles represent respect, they are an honor, but most of them can be
completely empty, without real value.  I can use several different
names to call God/Goddess, but at least for me, He/She is more than my
Lord/Lady, because He/She is not my owner, He/She is my Father/Mother.
An example about titles:  -  I like to say Mr. Mok-Kong Shen is my
Professor.  Technically, he is not a professor, but at least for me,
he is and I do not care about the rest of the world's opinion.  When I
was feeling much, really very much pain, almost going to the Intensive
Unity Care in the hospital, with no clue about life or death, he was
very worried about my health, trying to explain me his works to keep
me awake, studying, alive.  I am and will always be very grateful.  He
is so polite and formal that I always imagine he will blush and faint
if I say I adore him.  :P  :P  :P
I've had my first Yom Kippur this weekend and it was a bit
"unconventional",  but very special for me.  I want to learn more
about the Muslim culture too.  So, in this moment, I am crying for
hundreds of people in several different places, thinking about several
religions and Gods.  Sincerely hope the heart and soul of all of us
can find peace and comfort.  Words always seem so inadequate to
express the sadness, the deep frustration, the despair we all feel
after so many cruel and non-sense deaths.  Tears represent better how
much my heart is broken...  I will pray to the God of my childhood,
with no name, no gender, no prejudices, no cruelty, when I was
innocent and would never think someone would kill or hurt in God's
Peace, with or without a God or a religion.

(short fast answer, sorry, Juan!  I was talking with my mom, who lives in another city, when I read your

-  Mommy, "fuck you" in Japanese is "kutabare" or is another word?  :P
My mom is very angry with me until now, still saying how much my
parents worked to give me a good education and to wash my mouth with
soap very well  (even being a big girl, living alone in another city,

Juan, I love you and want you very, very alive, healthy and happy.  If
you die, who will I annoy, eh?  ;)
You know part of my personal history and how much I love books and
comics.  I have a few hundreds of both and usually donate books to
that small public library where I've spent a great part of my
childhood.  More or less 95% of physical books and comics are in my
parents' house, not here, in a small apartment.  I have only 3
dictionaries of Japanese and only one is with me now.  Unfortunately,
it's the Japanese-Japanese, with the first 939 basic "kanjis", uff...
Some of the ideograms use until 23 movements  (I paint them, not
exactly write them.  Not shodo, but has its beauty too.).  It's pretty
cute, but it isn't being useful now.  So, I will annoy you showing
another kanji and a lovely Nasa link to send your name to Mars, eeee!!
 I choose "yume" because it means "dream" and shows a boy thinking
about rockets.  Aww...  :)
#  #  Sorry, the pic is really bad, but I am tired and still feeling pain.
If I really hate you, I would wish you several medical exams in your
cerebrospinal fluid.  It hurts a lot and I am not exactly the luckiest
person in the world, so the anesthesia never works.  All the times,
the doctor mentions my "outdoor" (the hidden big tattoo) and we talk
about strange subjects to distract me, so I don't feel so much pain,
but I can't laugh or move during the procedure.
The cutest Japanese way to say "die!" is asking you to beat your head
against the corner of a "tofu"  (very soft soy cheese)  until you
die...  And "kutabare" means "fuck you" in my neighborhood.  I asked
my neighbors and now I want to discover the correct kanji to this
expression...  Shit (or "kuso", if you prefer), hiragana doesn't
count, Juan!  :P
Later, in another thread, I _do need_ to talk about the fabulous
samurai manga mentioned by John.  Love them, but you need to read the

Hi, Juan!  Hi, everybody!  :D
I was searching a little bit and talked with two friends who made
their post-doctorship in Tokyo.  Well, you are correct:  "Kutabare"
means "fall dead!" and "Shine"  (pronounce: something like "sheene")
means "die!", "go to Hell!" and similar expressions.  In Japan, they
use "Engurishu"  (English in "Engurishu", haha!!)  and the young
people usually say "Fuck You", but the sound is a bit strange, more or
less, "Fa~ku".
In countries where existed Japanese immigration, some of the old
"nihongo"  (Japanese language)  expressions were kept until now
("bendjou" isn't used in Japan actually, but is still used here
instead of "toeere" - toilet in "Engrish")  or were used in a
different sense  ("kutabare" is used as "fuck you" in some countries,
because it's more offensive than "die!").
Kisses!  :*

Oops, I was asking the kanji for "kutabare" because I thought its
meaning was "fuck you", sorry!
Oh, pure poetry!  ;D
I think they wanted to say "Do not die without seeing Naples before.",
"Only die after seeing Naples".
There is another outdated bad word here.  We still use "joro" to say
"bitch" and it isn't used in Japan anymore.  Please, do you know
another updated bad word to say it in an offensive way?

Hi, John!  Hope you are doing amazing and reading a lot of manga!  :D
#  In 2002, during the World Cup, the Brazil national football team was
the champion and Ronaldo was the Cup's top scorer, our best player.
Do you recognize his haircut?  :)
#  #  #  Hahaha!!!  The Word Cup happened in Japan and Korea and Japanese
people are very superstitious and love the "Lone Wolf And Cub" series,
so Kazuo Koike received hundreds and hundreds of letters and e-mails
begging for Daigoro' stories after his father's death.  They said that
Ronaldo's haircut was a signal of God, of Goseki Kojima to write more
stories giving Daigoro, still a toddler, a destiny.
So Koike asked for permission to Kojima's family and got a very brave
artist, with a similar style to Kojima, named Hideki Mori.  It was a
great honor, a huge responsibility, so Mori trained days and nights
like a crazy, almost becoming sick with all his efforts, giving his
best to make his drawings the most similar possible to Kojima's art.
All his drawings and paintings were revised for Kazuo Koike because he
promised it to Kojima's family and to the LW&C fans.  He searched the
perfection to honor his friend and collaborator, Goseki Kojima.
Loyalty and respect until the end.  <3
Wish you loyal and good friends, my dear.  Take care.  <3

menu.  All the times, I receive chicken or fish, uff...  I tried to
explain that I am veggie a lot of times and they say that chicken and
fish are super healthy white meat, extremely good for me.  But it's
meat the same way, cazzo...  I tried to joke with my doctors saying
they were being racists  (why white meat? haha!!)  and they asked me
to eat like a *normal* person... I bet they are putting bacon and
sausages in my beans, that lovely band of traitors!  :(((

I already said thank you in private to Juan for the explanations on
this topic.  It makes sense in some points of view, considering that
all kinds of oppression and exploration against people are deplorable,
including eventually God's ones.  Probably, I am too stupid and Mark
is too confusing, but I didn't understand his point until now.  I am
not talking about genders, deities, religions, whatever.  I really
just wanted to understand how God can help to create the real anarchy
if God is a kind of government  (source of divine laws, rules,
judgments, etc)  too?  :P
In any case, I forgot to tell Juan I am re-reading the "Bhagavad Gita"
   because of a great
friend of mine, who wrote an amazing post about it, mixing his
impressions of the book, now and when younger, with his own life and
coding.  It was a big shock for me.  It was one of Vincenzo, my
deceased fiancé's favorite books and I only read the Italian version
and made completely different interpretations of the same book.  I
read the same book probably with the same age of my friend and it gave
us different visions of the world and completely different lives.
Books are powerful and change lives.

Hi, Mark!  Thanks for answering, really appreciated it!  :D
Well, in the beginning, considering the Bible, everything was chaos
and darkness and God used the Word and created the light and, with it,
the world.  In different religious texts around the world, there are
several references to the power of the words to create, manage and/or
destroy, so I would very cautious about using God and religion and/or
religious books to get a real anarchy.  Usually, religions are
powerful, used to manipulate people, Mark, and I don't like this idea,
even being favorable to get the complete anarchy.  You need choose to
be free, understanding really well what being free means.
Yesterday, I had a very hard discussion about Old and New Testaments
of the Bible, the contradictions, the lapses, with a very interesting
Spiritualist teacher, who follows Allan Kardec's teachings
.  I am discussing the
Spiritism with a little group of friends because we are getting
donations for the Christmas all the weekends since last month.  It's
fun and a bit bizarre because I am doing the same with my Catholic
friends, who hate the Spiritualists and, at least for me, to hate, to
be so intolerant of the people is a sooo anti-God's love thing, haha!!
 ;D
Well, I am trying hard to get food, clothes, toys, and medicines for
orphanages, nursing homes, and poor families, not because of any God
or religion, but because I think it's the correct thing to be done if
I want a world a little better.  I don't know if God really exists and
I am not doing it because it's the hypocrite celebration of Jesus'
birth, but because it should be the rule of a good government:  help
the people with the basic necessities.  Unfortunately, no government
is good.  :(((

Juan and spaghetti lovers, this expression is really making good
references to Naples and the Napolitan pasta, very famous in Japan 60,
50 years ago.  It was called "spaghetti naporitan" there and the
recipe is a sin to an Italian  (spaghetti with ketchup, Dio mio!),
but it's still a strong reference to nostalgic comfort food to several
generations of "nihonjins".
There are several versions of the same recipe, but this is very nice
and simple:  sausage, pepper, onion, pasta, ketchup...  You will like

hurting someone, but I decided to learn better this kind of radical things

who I love...
Well, I am avoiding virtual contacts with some good people because I know I

them, really feel their bodies warmer and relaxed between my arms.

Michael Jackson - Thriller
# [Michael Jackson:]
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurkin' in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes,
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination, girl
But all the while you hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're outta time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with the forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life
They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together
All through the night I'll save you from the terror on the screen,
I'll make you see
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul could ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul could ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
[Vincent Price:]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
And whomsoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
[Michael Jackson:]
I'm gonna thrill you tonight...
[Vincent Price:]
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller

Zenaan, I am so sorry for you, for your weakness of character, and
this poor minded and pretentious kind of people who talks about your
sex life in public.  Search for better contacts and partners.  Avoid
the white supremacists and the hypocrites, please.  Avoid lies and
becoming even worse.
All religions are about love, but you can make a harmful, prejudiced
interpretation of all existent religious texts.  You need to follow
your heart, the love's path, and try to make better this world because
it will be our heritage to the future generations.  If your heart and
soul are so poor, so limited and weak, what I can sincerely recommend
to you is reading another excerpt of the Bible:
# 1 Corinthians 13 (ESV - English Standard Version)
The Way of Love
1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I
am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
2 And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all
knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but
have not love, I am nothing.
3 If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be
burned,but have not love, I gain nothing.
4 Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant
5 or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;
6 it does not rejoice at wrong doing, but rejoices with the truth.
7 Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things,
endures all things.
8 Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for
tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.
9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
10 but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.
11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I
reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.
12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know
in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.
13 So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest
of these is love.

I was joking with you, but being completely sincere, I do not give the
same importance to titles than the most of the people, my dear.
Titles represent respect, they are an honor, but most of them can be
completely empty, without real value.  I can use several different
names to call God/Goddess, but at least for me, He/She is more than my
Lord/Lady, because He/She is not my owner, He/She is my Father/Mother.
An example about titles:  -  I like to say Mr. Mok-Kong Shen is my
Professor.  Technically, he is not a professor, but at least for me,
he is and I do not care about the rest of the world's opinion.  When I
was feeling much, really very much pain, almost going to the Intensive
Unity Care in the hospital, with no clue about life or death, he was
very worried about my health, trying to explain me his works to keep
me awake, studying, alive.  I am and will always be very grateful.  He
is so polite and formal that I always imagine he will blush and faint
if I say I adore him.  :P  :P  :P
I've had my first Yom Kippur this weekend and it was a bit
"unconventional",  but very special for me.  I want to learn more
about the Muslim culture too.  So, in this moment, I am crying for
hundreds of people in several different places, thinking about several
religions and Gods.  Sincerely hope the heart and soul of all of us
can find peace and comfort.  Words always seem so inadequate to
express the sadness, the deep frustration, the despair we all feel
after so many cruel and non-sense deaths.  Tears represent better how
much my heart is broken...  I will pray to the God of my childhood,
with no name, no gender, no prejudices, no cruelty, when I was
innocent and would never think someone would kill or hurt in God's
Peace, with or without a God or a religion.

Hi folks, I've pulled together a list of good stories about two basic
subjects, how the Trump campaign used tech/social media to win votes
and how the Russians used it to interfere in the elections. Want to
know how Russian disinformation ended up on Pinterest and Pokemon Go?
Or perhaps a nice history of Russian subversion campaigns over the
decades? Either way, I gotcha covered. I figured folks on this list
could put it to good use.
I'll be updating this list as new stories come out, and please let me
know if I miss something. Some light reading for your Friday afternoon

(short fast answer, sorry, Juan!  I was talking with my mom, who lives in another city, when I read your
message, so I asked her:
-  Mommy, "fuck you" in Japanese is "kutabare" or is another word?  :P
My mom is very angry with me until now, still saying how much my
parents worked to give me a good education and to wash my mouth with
soap very well  (even being a big girl, living alone in another city,
haha!!)  because it's a very dirty expression, etc, etc.  It's true.
Sorry for almost say a very, very bad word to you, Juan, hahaha!!
(but you know that "fuck you" sometimes means "I fucking love you, you
annoying bastard!" in cecilian language.  No, my mom never will speak
this one, hahaha!!)
Just in case, Mark is an intelligent guy and I said it publicly on the
other list, but he is fucking boring and a compulsive liar.  Using his
own words, he is a "shitty human" and loves to be "the eternal victim
of this unfair society".  All of us are victims of the same corrupted

Juan, I love you and want you very, very alive, healthy and happy.  If
you die, who will I annoy, eh?  ;)
You know part of my personal history and how much I love books and
comics.  I have a few hundreds of both and usually donate books to
that small public library where I've spent a great part of my
childhood.  More or less 95% of physical books and comics are in my
parents' house, not here, in a small apartment.  I have only 3
dictionaries of Japanese and only one is with me now.  Unfortunately,
it's the Japanese-Japanese, with the first 939 basic "kanjis", uff...
Some of the ideograms use until 23 movements  (I paint them, not
exactly write them.  Not shodo, but has its beauty too.).  It's pretty
cute, but it isn't being useful now.  So, I will annoy you showing
another kanji and a lovely Nasa link to send your name to Mars, eeee!!
 I choose "yume" because it means "dream" and shows a boy thinking
about rockets.  Aww...  :)
#  #  Sorry, the pic is really bad, but I am tired and still feeling pain.
If I really hate you, I would wish you several medical exams in your
cerebrospinal fluid.  It hurts a lot and I am not exactly the luckiest
person in the world, so the anesthesia never works.  All the times,
the doctor mentions my "outdoor" (the hidden big tattoo) and we talk
about strange subjects to distract me, so I don't feel so much pain,
but I can't laugh or move during the procedure.
The cutest Japanese way to say "die!" is asking you to beat your head
against the corner of a "tofu"  (very soft soy cheese)  until you
die...  And "kutabare" means "fuck you" in my neighborhood.  I asked
my neighbors and now I want to discover the correct kanji to this
expression...  Shit (or "kuso", if you prefer), hiragana doesn't
count, Juan!  :P
Later, in another thread, I _do need_ to talk about the fabulous
samurai manga mentioned by John.  Love them, but you need to read the
old Lone Wolf And Cub.  It's extremely sad, heartbreaking, but very
beautiful and delicate.  And I am in love with Elizebeth Friedman,
wow!  And she was born on August, 26, wheee!!  ;D

Hi, Juan!  Hi, everybody!  :D
I was searching a little bit and talked with two friends who made
their post-doctorship in Tokyo.  Well, you are correct:  "Kutabare"
means "fall dead!" and "Shine"  (pronounce: something like "sheene")
means "die!", "go to Hell!" and similar expressions.  In Japan, they
use "Engurishu"  (English in "Engurishu", haha!!)  and the young
people usually say "Fuck You", but the sound is a bit strange, more or
less, "Fa~ku".
In countries where existed Japanese immigration, some of the old
"nihongo"  (Japanese language)  expressions were kept until now
("bendjou" isn't used in Japan actually, but is still used here
instead of "toeere" - toilet in "Engrish")  or were used in a
different sense  ("kutabare" is used as "fuck you" in some countries,
because it's more offensive than "die!").
Kisses!  :*
PS:  -  John, I love you and your messages, but I answer later because
I am almost "kutabareying"  - haha!! -  now, sorry.  Do you know the
history behind the New LW&C?  It's a fucking sad story, but its
background is very funny and  - wow! -  has very unexpected
connections with the Brazilian football  (Sorry, I prefer to use the
word "football" like in Europe.  It's ridiculous to call "football" a
sport where the guys use the hands and the arms to take the ball in
the whole game, aff...  And "soccer" is a word so meh, so
North-American...)  :-/

the champion and Ronaldo was the Cup's top scorer, our best player.
Do you recognize his haircut?  :)
#  #  #  Hahaha!!!  The Word Cup happened in Japan and Korea and Japanese
people are very superstitious and love the "Lone Wolf And Cub" series,
so Kazuo Koike received hundreds and hundreds of letters and e-mails
begging for Daigoro' stories after his father's death.  They said that
Ronaldo's haircut was a signal of God, of Goseki Kojima to write more
stories giving Daigoro, still a toddler, a destiny.
So Koike asked for permission to Kojima's family and got a very brave
artist, with a similar style to Kojima, named Hideki Mori.  It was a
great honor, a huge responsibility, so Mori trained days and nights
like a crazy, almost becoming sick with all his efforts, giving his
best to make his drawings the most similar possible to Kojima's art.
All his drawings and paintings were revised for Kazuo Koike because he
promised it to Kojima's family and to the LW&C fans.  He searched the
perfection to honor his friend and collaborator, Goseki Kojima.

Mark, I love filters and you were blocked a few days ago, so I am
reading your bizarre commentaries and answers only because of Juan's
courtesy.  Should I thank you for this garbage, my dear Juan?
Hahaha!!  ;D
I was *not* questioning God's gender or something similar, just asking
what the heck God has to do with anarchism and politics?  I don't know
if God really exists, guy.  Why would I waste my time discussing God's
gender on a CyperPunk list?  Are you crazy?  :P
And I don't have any reason to talk about my gender either.  I am a
cis woman and won't send pics of my pussy and breasts to prove you are
wrong.  But if you feel happy thinking I am a man, please do it.  Just
remember that I am much more "macho" than you and my penis is bigger
than the one of this guy here, but I am discreet and don't show it on
the TV, hahahaha!!!  ;D
#  Ok, explain what God has to do with politics?  God hates all the
people and shows it giving us corrupt and vile governments?  What is
your point?  Is there a real point?!  :-/

You are completely right.  It's pretty bizarre to share the word in:

I already said thank you in private to Juan for the explanations on
this topic.  It makes sense in some points of view, considering that
all kinds of oppression and exploration against people are deplorable,
including eventually God's ones.  Probably, I am too stupid and Mark
is too confusing, but I didn't understand his point until now.  I am
not talking about genders, deities, religions, whatever.  I really
just wanted to understand how God can help to create the real anarchy
if God is a kind of government  (source of divine laws, rules,
judgments, etc)  too?  :P
In any case, I forgot to tell Juan I am re-reading the "Bhagavad Gita"
   because of a great
friend of mine, who wrote an amazing post about it, mixing his
impressions of the book, now and when younger, with his own life and
coding.  It was a big shock for me.  It was one of Vincenzo, my
deceased fiancé's favorite books and I only read the Italian version
and made completely different interpretations of the same book.  I
read the same book probably with the same age of my friend and it gave
us different visions of the world and completely different lives.
Books are powerful and change lives.
Hey, Juan!  Thank you again!  :)

Hi, Mark!  Thanks for answering, really appreciated it!  :D
Well, in the beginning, considering the Bible, everything was chaos
and darkness and God used the Word and created the light and, with it,
the world.  In different religious texts around the world, there are
several references to the power of the words to create, manage and/or
destroy, so I would very cautious about using God and religion and/or
religious books to get a real anarchy.  Usually, religions are
powerful, used to manipulate people, Mark, and I don't like this idea,
even being favorable to get the complete anarchy.  You need choose to
be free, understanding really well what being free means.
Yesterday, I had a very hard discussion about Old and New Testaments
of the Bible, the contradictions, the lapses, with a very interesting
Spiritualist teacher, who follows Allan Kardec's teachings
.  I am discussing the
Spiritism with a little group of friends because we are getting
donations for the Christmas all the weekends since last month.  It's
fun and a bit bizarre because I am doing the same with my Catholic
friends, who hate the Spiritualists and, at least for me, to hate, to
be so intolerant of the people is a sooo anti-God's love thing, haha!!
 ;D
Well, I am trying hard to get food, clothes, toys, and medicines for
orphanages, nursing homes, and poor families, not because of any God
or religion, but because I think it's the correct thing to be done if
I want a world a little better.  I don't know if God really exists and
I am not doing it because it's the hypocrite celebration of Jesus'
birth, but because it should be the rule of a good government:  help
the people with the basic necessities.  Unfortunately, no government
is good.  :(((

Juan and spaghetti lovers, this expression is really making good
references to Naples and the Napolitan pasta, very famous in Japan 60,
50 years ago.  It was called "spaghetti naporitan" there and the
recipe is a sin to an Italian  (spaghetti with ketchup, Dio mio!),
but it's still a strong reference to nostalgic comfort food to several
generations of "nihonjins".
There are several versions of the same recipe, but this is very nice
and simple:  sausage, pepper, onion, pasta, ketchup...  You will like
it, dear!  :D

How about the other "Cecilias Tanakas" and the pics you've in private to me

My account was deleted more than an year and almost half ago, after
understanding how much I needed to say goodbye to Aleph and other dead

of my past, happy laughs, sad stories, professional cute contacts, couch
surfing, hackerspaces, events in the whole world...  Amazingly creative

I survived to death 5 times, Zenaan.  The last one because I had to
physically fight for living and I was very hurt, so tired of everything,
but living it was more important.  It's really repugnant the idea of
hurting someone, but I decided to learn better this kind of radical things
to keep protected my loved ones. I do not care about me, but about those
who I love...
Well, I am avoiding virtual contacts with some good people because I know I
can be tracked and I am not smart enough to protect them sufficiently.  It
hurts me a lot. In some cases, I just wanted to say "I love you" and hug
them, really feel their bodies warmer and relaxed between my arms.

Michael Jackson - Thriller
# [Michael Jackson:]
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurkin' in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes,
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination, girl
But all the while you hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're outta time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with the forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
Night creatures call
And the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time (they're open wide)
This is the end of your life
They're out to get you, there's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time for you and I to cuddle close together
All through the night I'll save you from the terror on the screen,
I'll make you see
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghoul could ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghoul could ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
[Vincent Price:]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
And whomsoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
[Michael Jackson:]
I'm gonna thrill you tonight...
[Vincent Price:]
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller

"EFF resigns from W3C over DRM drama"
After the Electronic Frontier Foundation appealed the July decision by
the director of the World Wide Web Consortium to publish a DRM
standard without a compromise to protect accessibility, security
research, archiving, and competition, the W3C took a vote. A slim
margin voted to proceed with publication, and the W3C went ahead with
it. On the basis of this "unprecedented move in a body that has always
operated on consensus and compromise," Cory Doctorow explains why the
EFF has resigned from the W3C.
"World Wide Web Consortium abandons consensus, standardizes DRM with
58.4% support, EFF resigns".
In July, the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium overruled
dozens of members' objections to publishing a DRM standard without a
compromise to protect accessibility, security research, archiving, and
EFF appealed the decision, the first-ever appeal in W3C history, which
concluded last week with a deeply divided membership. 58.4% of the
group voted to go on with publication, and the W3C did so today, an
unprecedented move in a body that has always operated on consensus and
compromise. In their public statements about the standard, the W3C
executive repeatedly said that they didn't think the DRM advocates
would be willing to compromise, and in the absence of such
willingness, the exec have given them everything they demanded.
This is a bad day for the W3C: it's the day it publishes a standard
designed to control, rather than empower, web users. That standard
that was explicitly published without any protections -- even the most
minimal compromise was rejected without discussion, an intransigence
that the W3C leadership tacitly approved. It's the day that the W3C
changed its process to reward stonewalling over compromise, provided
those doing the stonewalling are the biggest corporations in the
EFF no longer believes that the W3C process is suited to defending the
open web. We have resigned from the Consortium, effective today. Below
is our resignation letter:
Dear Jeff, Tim, and colleagues,
In 2013, EFF was disappointed to learn that the W3C had taken on the
project of standardizing “Encrypted Media Extensions,” an API whose
sole function was to provide a first-class role for DRM within the Web
browser ecosystem. By doing so, the organization offered the use of
its patent pool, its staff support, and its moral authority to the
idea that browsers can and should be designed to cede control over key
aspects from users to remote parties.
When it became clear, following our formal objection, that the W3C's
largest corporate members and leadership were wedded to this project
despite strong discontent from within the W3C membership and staff,
their most important partners, and other supporters of the open Web,
we proposed a compromise. We agreed to stand down regarding the EME
standard, provided that the W3C extend its existing IPR policies to
deter members from using DRM laws in connection with the EME (such as
Section 1201 of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act or European
national implementations of Article 6 of the EUCD) except in
combination with another cause of action.
This covenant would allow the W3C's large corporate members to enforce
their copyrights. Indeed, it kept intact every legal right to which
entertainment companies, DRM vendors, and their business partners can
otherwise lay claim. The compromise merely restricted their ability to
use the W3C's DRM to shut down legitimate activities, like research
and modifications, that required circumvention of DRM. It would signal
to the world that the W3C wanted to make a difference in how DRM was
enforced: that it would use its authority to draw a line between the
acceptability of DRM as an optional technology, as opposed to an
excuse to undermine legitimate research and innovation.
More directly, such a covenant would have helped protect the key
stakeholders, present and future, who both depend on the openness of
the Web, and who actively work to protect its safety and universality.
It would offer some legal clarity for those who bypass DRM to engage
in security research to find defects that would endanger billions of
web users; or who automate the creation of enhanced, accessible video
for people with disabilities; or who archive the Web for posterity. It
would help protect new market entrants intent on creating competitive,
innovative products, unimagined by the vendors locking down web video.
Despite the support of W3C members from many sectors, the leadership
of the W3C rejected this compromise. The W3C leadership countered with
proposals — like the chartering of a nonbinding discussion group on
the policy questions that was not scheduled to report in until long
after the EME ship had sailed — that would have still left
researchers, governments, archives, security experts unprotected.
The W3C is a body that ostensibly operates on consensus. Nevertheless,
as the coalition in support of a DRM compromise grew and grew — and
the large corporate members continued to reject any meaningful
compromise — the W3C leadership persisted in treating EME as topic
that could be decided by one side of the debate. In essence, a core of
EME proponents was able to impose its will on the Consortium, over the
wishes of a sizeable group of objectors — and every person who uses
the web. The Director decided to personally override every single
objection raised by the members, articulating several benefits that
EME offered over the DRM that HTML5 had made impossible.
But those very benefits (such as improvements to accessibility and
privacy) depend on the public being able to exercise rights they lose
under DRM law — which meant that without the compromise the Director
was overriding, none of those benefits could be realized, either. That
rejection prompted the first appeal against the Director in W3C
In our campaigning on this issue, we have spoken to many, many
members' representatives who privately confided their belief that the
EME was a terrible idea (generally they used stronger language) and
their sincere desire that their employer wasn't on the wrong side of
this issue. This is unsurprising. You have to search long and hard to
find an independent technologist who believes that DRM is possible,
let alone a good idea. Yet, somewhere along the way, the business
values of those outside the web got important enough, and the values
of technologists who built it got disposable enough, that even the
wise elders who make our standards voted for something they know to be
a fool's errand.
We believe they will regret that choice. Today, the W3C bequeaths a
legally unauditable attack-surface to browsers used by billions of
people. They give media companies the power to sue or intimidate away
those who might re-purpose video for people with disabilities. They
side against the archivists who are scrambling to preserve the public
record of our era. The W3C process has been abused by companies that
made their fortunes by upsetting the established order, and now,
thanks to EME, they’ll be able to ensure no one ever subjects them to
the same innovative pressures.
So we'll keep fighting to keep the web free and open. We'll keep suing
the US government to overturn the laws that make DRM so toxic, and
we'll keep bringing that fight to the world's legislatures that are
being misled by the US Trade Representative to instigate local
equivalents to America's legal mistakes.
We will renew our work to battle the media companies that fail to
adapt videos for accessibility purposes, even though the W3C
squandered the perfect moment to exact a promise to protect those who
are doing that work for them.
We will defend those who are put in harm's way for blowing the whistle
on defects in EME implementations.
It is a tragedy that we will be doing that without our friends at the
W3C, and with the world believing that the pioneers and creators of
the web no longer care about these matters.
Effective today, EFF is resigning from the W3C.
Thank you,
Cory Doctorow
Advisory Committee Representative to the W3C for the Electronic
Frontier Foundation

"EFF resigns from W3C over DRM drama"
After the Electronic Frontier Foundation appealed the July decision by
the director of the World Wide Web Consortium to publish a DRM
standard without a compromise to protect accessibility, security
research, archiving, and competition, the W3C took a vote. A slim
margin voted to proceed with publication, and the W3C went ahead with
it. On the basis of this "unprecedented move in a body that has always
operated on consensus and compromise," Cory Doctorow explains why the
EFF has resigned from the W3C.
"World Wide Web Consortium abandons consensus, standardizes DRM with
58.4% support, EFF resigns".
In July, the Director of the World Wide Web Consortium overruled
dozens of members' objections to publishing a DRM standard without a
compromise to protect accessibility, security research, archiving, and
EFF appealed the decision, the first-ever appeal in W3C history, which
concluded last week with a deeply divided membership. 58.4% of the
group voted to go on with publication, and the W3C did so today, an
unprecedented move in a body that has always operated on consensus and
compromise. In their public statements about the standard, the W3C
executive repeatedly said that they didn't think the DRM advocates
would be willing to compromise, and in the absence of such
willingness, the exec have given them everything they demanded.
This is a bad day for the W3C: it's the day it publishes a standard
designed to control, rather than empower, web users. That standard
that was explicitly published without any protections -- even the most
minimal compromise was rejected without discussion, an intransigence
that the W3C leadership tacitly approved. It's the day that the W3C
changed its process to reward stonewalling over compromise, provided
those doing the stonewalling are the biggest corporations in the
EFF no longer believes that the W3C process is suited to defending the
open web. We have resigned from the Consortium, effective today. Below
is our resignation letter:
Dear Jeff, Tim, and colleagues,
In 2013, EFF was disappointed to learn that the W3C had taken on the
project of standardizing “Encrypted Media Extensions,” an API whose
sole function was to provide a first-class role for DRM within the Web
browser ecosystem. By doing so, the organization offered the use of
its patent pool, its staff support, and its moral authority to the
idea that browsers can and should be designed to cede control over key
aspects from users to remote parties.
When it became clear, following our formal objection, that the W3C's
largest corporate members and leadership were wedded to this project
despite strong discontent from within the W3C membership and staff,
their most important partners, and other supporters of the open Web,
we proposed a compromise. We agreed to stand down regarding the EME
standard, provided that the W3C extend its existing IPR policies to
deter members from using DRM laws in connection with the EME (such as
Section 1201 of the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act or European
national implementations of Article 6 of the EUCD) except in
combination with another cause of action.
This covenant would allow the W3C's large corporate members to enforce
their copyrights. Indeed, it kept intact every legal right to which
entertainment companies, DRM vendors, and their business partners can
otherwise lay claim. The compromise merely restricted their ability to
use the W3C's DRM to shut down legitimate activities, like research
and modifications, that required circumvention of DRM. It would signal
to the world that the W3C wanted to make a difference in how DRM was
enforced: that it would use its authority to draw a line between the
acceptability of DRM as an optional technology, as opposed to an
excuse to undermine legitimate research and innovation.
More directly, such a covenant would have helped protect the key
stakeholders, present and future, who both depend on the openness of
the Web, and who actively work to protect its safety and universality.
It would offer some legal clarity for those who bypass DRM to engage
in security research to find defects that would endanger billions of
web users; or who automate the creation of enhanced, accessible video
for people with disabilities; or who archive the Web for posterity. It
would help protect new market entrants intent on creating competitive,
innovative products, unimagined by the vendors locking down web video.
Despite the support of W3C members from many sectors, the leadership
of the W3C rejected this compromise. The W3C leadership countered with
proposals — like the chartering of a nonbinding discussion group on
the policy questions that was not scheduled to report in until long
after the EME ship had sailed — that would have still left
researchers, governments, archives, security experts unprotected.
The W3C is a body that ostensibly operates on consensus. Nevertheless,
as the coalition in support of a DRM compromise grew and grew — and
the large corporate members continued to reject any meaningful
compromise — the W3C leadership persisted in treating EME as topic
that could be decided by one side of the debate. In essence, a core of
EME proponents was able to impose its will on the Consortium, over the
wishes of a sizeable group of objectors — and every person who uses
the web. The Director decided to personally override every single
objection raised by the members, articulating several benefits that
EME offered over the DRM that HTML5 had made impossible.
But those very benefits (such as improvements to accessibility and
privacy) depend on the public being able to exercise rights they lose
under DRM law — which meant that without the compromise the Director
was overriding, none of those benefits could be realized, either. That
rejection prompted the first appeal against the Director in W3C
In our campaigning on this issue, we have spoken to many, many
members' representatives who privately confided their belief that the
EME was a terrible idea (generally they used stronger language) and
their sincere desire that their employer wasn't on the wrong side of
this issue. This is unsurprising. You have to search long and hard to
find an independent technologist who believes that DRM is possible,
let alone a good idea. Yet, somewhere along the way, the business
values of those outside the web got important enough, and the values
of technologists who built it got disposable enough, that even the
wise elders who make our standards voted for something they know to be
a fool's errand.
We believe they will regret that choice. Today, the W3C bequeaths a
legally unauditable attack-surface to browsers used by billions of
people. They give media companies the power to sue or intimidate away
those who might re-purpose video for people with disabilities. They
side against the archivists who are scrambling to preserve the public
record of our era. The W3C process has been abused by companies that
made their fortunes by upsetting the established order, and now,
thanks to EME, they’ll be able to ensure no one ever subjects them to
the same innovative pressures.
So we'll keep fighting to keep the web free and open. We'll keep suing
the US government to overturn the laws that make DRM so toxic, and
we'll keep bringing that fight to the world's legislatures that are
being misled by the US Trade Representative to instigate local
equivalents to America's legal mistakes.
We will renew our work to battle the media companies that fail to
adapt videos for accessibility purposes, even though the W3C
squandered the perfect moment to exact a promise to protect those who
are doing that work for them.
We will defend those who are put in harm's way for blowing the whistle
on defects in EME implementations.
It is a tragedy that we will be doing that without our friends at the
W3C, and with the world believing that the pioneers and creators of
the web no longer care about these matters.
Effective today, EFF is resigning from the W3C.
Thank you,
Cory Doctorow
Advisory Committee Representative to the W3C for the Electronic
Frontier Foundation

Confirmed again, now with more attention:  -  ZH really posted on CP list
_after_ sending that dramatic message for you.  The message was received
and, obviously, ignored.  :)
So, be happy and don't worry, la la la...  ;)
My dear Greg,
I did not read none of them, but (s)he sent a lot of messages to
Cypherpunks List yesterday.  All received and, sorry, deleted without
reading, because my inbox is not a toilet and I have more interesting
things to do.  Maybe manicure, games or reading comics?  Hahaha!!  ;D
You asked me to follow up the messages, not for reading them, dear.  Thank
you for it.  :)
I don't know why (s)he is always mentioning this kind of victivism,
pretending to be special, a new leader, blah-blah-blah.  Maybe to get
attention?  Since I begin on this list, it's the fourth time.  Not much
original, ugh!  :P
But, well, one of them was very funny, because (s)he was sending his/her
messages to the wrong address  - d'oh! -  and made a real Carnival, telling
everybody (s)he was being "censured" on this list, hahaha!!    ;D
Riad had much patience and you too.  Thank you both for keeping the list
working well!  <3
Now my filters will return to the usual configuration, my dear.  No more
Yawwn Zzzzz messages in my inbox and I will take a nap.  (- _ -)zzzz
Tender kisses and hugs.  Take care, be happy and thank you again!  <3

        are you talking about the motherfucking piece of shit
        responsible for the new, criminal, 'DRM' in the web? Is that the
        worthless scumbag you are referring to when you say 'sir'
        'lee'?
        Well, that piece of shit 'sir' 'lee' is certainly a criminal and
        the fact that the the UK nazi government considers him better
        than ordinary persons (hence that 'sir' bullshit), tells you
        that he's actually worse than ordinary persons.
        Looks like some 'progressive' nazis like lee are more equal
        than others eh.
Juan, just for personal curiosity, why your little buddy Zzzzzz can send
messages about the Bible and call Jesus as her/his "Lord", but I can't call
Tim Berners-Lee a "Sir"?  At least, he certainly exists!  :P
Lord, Sir...  Pff, just formal titles...  You know I don't like them.  If
you want titles, my favorite ones are being the "Cuteness Secretary" in one

An OT personal story about "races" to explain that all the persons matter
the same, that all of them have their own beauty and beliefs:  -  In the
past, already had the chance of knowing two different Amazon's Indian
tribes.  I hated the f_cking heat and all the odious mosquitoes, had no
courage to eat ants and other insects, I was feeling dehydrated all the
time, and had a horrible fear of being bitten by a snake in my buttocks
while peeing in the forest.  It was a complete shit, a disaster, but
strangely, at same time, was very interesting and instructive.
I was the first Japanese girl that most of those Indians saw in their
lives.  I was f_cking pale, with freckles and brown curly hair, talking to
them with a strange accent, but intuitively they know we all were human
beings feeling exactly the same.  They respected me and I respected them.
We shared our food and water.  I painted their faces with my lipsticks and
they painted me with minerals and fruits natural pigments.
One of my friends  - and also one of my teachers -  is a Japanese guy
completely in love with Python.  He gave Python programming courses to new
PyLadies in several countries of the African continent and it was awesome.
His experiences were similar to mine in some aspects.
Humans beings like to learn and to teach each other, to share their
knowledge.  The color of your skin is just the way your skin is.  They
never thought  "Oh, poor yellow guy, so ignorant and inferior to us!"
The same happened with me among the Indians.  I was one of them, even
having a different apparence.
White, Black, Yellow, Red, Green, Purple, Plaid, Golden, Rainbow...  The
color of your skin is just a color.  The blood in our veins has the same
color, the same value.  Our tears and pains are the same.  We all feel
love, fear, joy, sadness, hunger, gratitude...  All lives matter.  All
lives are important.
Why to spend so much time trying to prove that black people are "inferior"
to you, James?  God, your ego must be more fragile than your balls...  Get
a life, please.  Search for psychological treatment and learn how much
bigger the world is than your own belly.
You are not a genius trying to share the  - ooooh! - "real truth".  You are
just an old sick man being used as a puppet to spread more hate in this
poor f_cked world.  This is the world where your grandchildren will grown
up, James.  If you really love them, think about their future, please.
Wish you all a lovely Sunday, full of harmony, peace, hopes, and the
sweetest dreams.
PS - OT: - "Braying" and "barking" do _not_ count as official languages,

        I'm of course referring to the feminists. The 'progressives' are
nothing but recycled puritan monkeys with exactly the same lunatic anti sex
views. The feminists are just  recycled, witch-burning  joo-kkkristians.
        Funnily enough there is a sizable number of fake libertarian scum
who are also feminists. Then again americunt 'libertarians' are just
fascists with a thin veneer of libertarian rhetoric so it's hardly
surprising. So libertarians are apologist of google, goldmand sachs and
feminazis! Cool!.
        Oh, it's also worth looking into the 'progressives' involvenment in
eugenics, and the voting record of the 'democratic party' regarding slavery
        last but not least, the same western 'progressives' who stridently
whine about 'womenyzzx' fictional oppression in the west  are the same

The world population was estimated to have reached 7,6 billion in December,
2017.  And these stupid racist guys are ignored for more than 99,99999999%
of all the people in the world, hihihi...  :)
The funniest thing is to notice that they _really_ think to be "very
relevant" to the whole humanity, the "studest" badass intellectual guys of
this "wow, much wow!" discussion list, always dishonestly trying to prove
that the quantity of melanin in a person' skin can influence in their
character.  Aff...  :(
Hee-haw, Hee-haw, Hee-haw...  Stop braying always the same things, please.
It's boring!  :((
The things do simply not work this way, HarkLess's fake personas, James,
Jim. (the stupid ZeNazi's friend, NOT Jim Bell, please)  among other
trolls, dear guys...  :((
Please, today is Sunday.  Why do you not use the free time for getting a
life, eh?!  ;)
An OT personal story about "races" to explain that all the persons matter
the same, that all of them have their own beauty and beliefs:  -  In the
past, already had the chance of knowing two different Amazon's Indian
tribes.  I hated the f_cking heat and all the odious mosquitoes, had no
courage to eat ants and other insects, I was feeling dehydrated all the
time, and had a horrible fear of being bitten by a snake in my buttocks
while peeing in the forest.  It was a complete shit, a disaster, but
strangely, at same time, was very interesting and instructive.
I was the first Japanese girl that most of those Indians saw in their
lives.  I was f_cking pale, with freckles and brown curly hair, talking to
them with a strange accent, but intuitively they know we all were human
beings feeling exactly the same.  They respected me and I respected them.
We shared our food and water.  I painted their faces with my lipsticks and
they painted me with minerals and fruits natural pigments.
One of my friends  - and also one of my teachers -  is a Japanese guy
completely in love with Python.  He gave Python programming courses to new
PyLadies in several countries of the African continent and it was awesome.
His experiences were similar to mine in some aspects.
Humans beings like to learn and to teach each other, to share their
knowledge.  The color of your skin is just the way your skin is.  They
never thought  "Oh, poor yellow guy, so ignorant and inferior to us!"
The same happened with me among the Indians.  I was one of them, even
having a different apparence.
White, Black, Yellow, Red, Green, Purple, Plaid, Golden, Rainbow...  The
color of your skin is just a color.  The blood in our veins has the same
color, the same value.  Our tears and pains are the same.  We all feel
love, fear, joy, sadness, hunger, gratitude...  All lives matter.  All
lives are important.
Why to spend so much time trying to prove that black people are "inferior"
to you, James?  God, your ego must be more fragile than your balls...  Get
a life, please.  Search for psychological treatment and learn how much
bigger the world is than your own belly.
You are not a genius trying to share the  - ooooh! - "real truth".  You are
just an old sick man being used as a puppet to spread more hate in this
poor f_cked world.  This is the world where your grandchildren will grown
up, James.  If you really love them, think about their future, please.
Wish you all a lovely Sunday, full of harmony, peace, hopes, and the
sweetest dreams.
PS - OT: - "Braying" and "barking" do _not_ count as official languages,
ZeNazi.  Stop saying you are a polyglot, please.  It's very embarrassing
when you pretend to be an "intellectual" in other lists, eeeck!  :((

        I'm of course referring to the feminists. The 'progressives' are
nothing but recycled puritan monkeys with exactly the same lunatic anti sex
views. The feminists are just  recycled, witch-burning  joo-kkkristians.
        Funnily enough there is a sizable number of fake libertarian scum
who are also feminists. Then again americunt 'libertarians' are just
fascists with a thin veneer of libertarian rhetoric so it's hardly
surprising. So libertarians are apologist of google, goldmand sachs and
feminazis! Cool!.
        Oh, it's also worth looking into the 'progressives' involvenment in
eugenics, and the voting record of the 'democratic party' regarding slavery
        last but not least, the same western 'progressives' who stridently
whine about 'womenyzzx' fictional oppression in the west  are the same
supreme scum who blow up women and children in the midle east for fun and

Tsk, tsk...  So sorry for you, James.  Your senile dementia is evidently
becoming pretty worse and, strangely, very "selective" about subjects
related to your personal life.  :)
Why are you obviously avoiding to answer *which exactly is your church*, my
darling?  Fear of being rejected by all the other members?  Or are you
feeling ashamed for following a very stupid not recognized Christian
church?  Hihihi...  ;)
Well, I never was a "Social Justice Warrior" or claimed to be one of them.
And I do really not understand why you think I don't have a social life, a
family, and real good friends, people which deserve my most sincere love
and care.
Do you think I spend my free time searching for "allies"?  Which kind of
"alliance" and exactly for what, please?  God, it makes no sense, aff...
Did Gandalf invite me to a journey with hobbits, elves and dwarfs, and I
wasn't informed about it yet?  :P
Seriously, James, I do also love German men, but your intense relationship
with Dr. Alzheimer is becoming indecently explicit...  :P
If you are describing your own miserable life, please, do not project your
loneliness and your social frustrations in me.  I am not guilty if you had
a "bad boy's cock carousel" and never received a call or a text in the day
after.  I swear it never was my case, darling.  Hehe, Oriental charm, you
know...  Oh, no, you do *not* know, hahaha!!!  ;D
I am much better than you in several aspects, including the sexual one,
obviously.  I don't need Viagra or other drugs for being 'ready' and I
don't need to sleep the whole night to get the 'second round', hahaha!!!  ;D
A few days ago, you wrote two very stupid messages showing your evident
ignorance about feeding.  You don't know anything about the difference
between "vegetarian" and "vegan" diets and beliefs, even being f_cking easy
to make a simple 5 minutes research and reading.
So, I suggest you to read about "straight edge" people.  You will spend
only a few minutes and will learn a lot about me, poor old loser.
Tell us which is your church, dear.  Why are you being so shy?  And why do
you think you will never receive anonymous packs with dildos and anal beads
in your so pure and sacred home, uh?  :)
Oh, and if you like talking to rejected, lonely, and needy bitches, you
should consider to send your nasty messages to your friend Zenaan, not for
me or to this list, James.  :P
You both should find more guys like you and making a hot "lemon party".
Oh, it will be amazing if Trump accept your invitation, sweetie!  You
already said publicly that "he's very handsome, tall, and rich"!  :D
Well, it is what *you* search in a man, not me.  I search for intelligence,
character, and sense of humor.  And Trump seems an old orange disgusting
frog, but uglier and less intelligent and smart, eeeck!!!  (>_<)*
It was very embarrassing to receive lots of Zenaan's stupid messages
begging for a bit of attention, mentioning my cuteness and intelligence,
trying desperately to get an answer.  He never understood I only appreciate
intelligent men and the poor devil is so homophobic that will never leave
the closet, even more the box, hahaha!!  ;D
Regards to your fictional "happy family", James.  Hope you are not the
father of some of your grandchildren, bad seed guy!  Ugh, it's a pretty

it's a possibility to be seriously considered...  :(((

pornography from Cecilia than even one-tenth of the flagrant racist
(including white supremacist), anti-semitic, homophobic, and dishonest
spam that eminates from the like of those who I now call  and I thank you sincerely, but please let this topic die forever.  Ben did
probably not read James' messages and his personal attacks to me or
purposely ignored them.  He criticized only my answers and, well, his
aggressive public reaction was a really precious lesson to me.
**I swear I will never try to help another unknown and foreign runaway
hacker, depressed enough for considering killing himself, sincerely
offering my home and my personal contacts to give him some support.**
He could simply give me a sincere heads up in private about my messages,
honestly criticizing them and their content, when, only some weeks ago,
contacted me in private asking about me.  I was so, really so happy for
knowing his personal storm was apparently finished and he was doing
good...  I was very stupid.
Well, not my problem anymore.  He knows very well how much I do hate false
and hypocrite persons and I will never trust him again.  Really sorry for
wasting my time last year, reading his "pathetic" private messages asking
for help and answering to them when he was feeling deeply sad and lost.
I hate the sensation of being humiliated in public for someone that I used
to trust, someone who used to be my friend, but it is evidently **not** a
problem for him, so he will not waste his time reading this message and
giving it an answer.  Anyway, he died for me yesterday and I think a
supposed "badass hacker" knows very well how to create messages filters.
Wish you all a lovely day.  I will lurk for some time because it will
certainly be much healthier for me.
** I am feeling really sick about hypocrite disgusting people who think
it's OK to post White Supremacist and Nazi content, but it's really
shocking to mention sex.  It's f_cking creepy and unfair because James'
messages mentioning **MY** supposed sexual life can be freely posted, but
if I mention **HIS** sexual life, I am annoying the CP list and destroying
it.  Aff, deeply ridiculous situation...**

So James, how long have you been experiencing these bizarre delusions?
Have you have any visual or auditory hallucinations?  Have you reported
them to your psychologist or psychiatrist?
Steve, my lovely friend, is pretty obvious James had no psychological
and/or psychiatriac support until now.
James has a so sick and disturbing vision about single women and having
several children that makes possible to think seriously about an early
Oedipus Complex.
Well, Oedipus was the first, the original "motherf_cker".   I think it's a
pretty good way of describing James using one single word, but I bet he
never satisfied his sexual dreams while a kid because he's obviously also a
real "son of a b_tch" and probably could not pay his own mommy's prices, a
single woman working very, very hard with harder things...
Tsk, tsk...  Sad life history.  Search for medical support, James.  It can
be very traumatic never discover who was your father and having so bad
references about single women like your dear mommy...  :((

Hmm, the CP list's dyslexic "genius" is very, very slow and probably

Javascript can be, and should be, compiled into caja, which is a safe
subset of Javascript.
Unfortunately, this solution is only available for servers, not end users.
Thank you very much for the unexpected, but sincerely much appreciated
answer, James.  :)

Please do not confuse Java and JavaScript. The only relationship between
the two is that Netscape paid Sun to license the Java trademark to what
was previously known as LiveScript. (This was back when Netscape and Sun
still existed as separate companies, mid-1990s or so.)

"Cock carousel", "bad boys", "Social Justice Warrior", "no friends"...
Tsk, tsk...  So sorry for you, James.  Your senile dementia is evidently
becoming pretty worse and, strangely, very "selective" about subjects
related to your personal life.  :)
Why are you obviously avoiding to answer *which exactly is your church*, my
darling?  Fear of being rejected by all the other members?  Or are you
feeling ashamed for following a very stupid not recognized Christian
church?  Hihihi...  ;)
Well, I never was a "Social Justice Warrior" or claimed to be one of them.
And I do really not understand why you think I don't have a social life, a
family, and real good friends, people which deserve my most sincere love
and care.
Do you think I spend my free time searching for "allies"?  Which kind of
"alliance" and exactly for what, please?  God, it makes no sense, aff...
Did Gandalf invite me to a journey with hobbits, elves and dwarfs, and I
wasn't informed about it yet?  :P
Seriously, James, I do also love German men, but your intense relationship
with Dr. Alzheimer is becoming indecently explicit...  :P
If you are describing your own miserable life, please, do not project your
loneliness and your social frustrations in me.  I am not guilty if you had
a "bad boy's cock carousel" and never received a call or a text in the day
after.  I swear it never was my case, darling.  Hehe, Oriental charm, you
know...  Oh, no, you do *not* know, hahaha!!!  ;D
I am much better than you in several aspects, including the sexual one,
obviously.  I don't need Viagra or other drugs for being 'ready' and I
don't need to sleep the whole night to get the 'second round', hahaha!!!  ;D
A few days ago, you wrote two very stupid messages showing your evident
ignorance about feeding.  You don't know anything about the difference
between "vegetarian" and "vegan" diets and beliefs, even being f_cking easy
to make a simple 5 minutes research and reading.
So, I suggest you to read about "straight edge" people.  You will spend
only a few minutes and will learn a lot about me, poor old loser.
Tell us which is your church, dear.  Why are you being so shy?  And why do
you think you will never receive anonymous packs with dildos and anal beads
in your so pure and sacred home, uh?  :)
Oh, and if you like talking to rejected, lonely, and needy bitches, you
should consider to send your nasty messages to your friend Zenaan, not for
me or to this list, James.  :P
You both should find more guys like you and making a hot "lemon party".
Oh, it will be amazing if Trump accept your invitation, sweetie!  You
already said publicly that "he's very handsome, tall, and rich"!  :D
Well, it is what *you* search in a man, not me.  I search for intelligence,
character, and sense of humor.  And Trump seems an old orange disgusting
frog, but uglier and less intelligent and smart, eeeck!!!  (>_<)*
It was very embarrassing to receive lots of Zenaan's stupid messages
begging for a bit of attention, mentioning my cuteness and intelligence,
trying desperately to get an answer.  He never understood I only appreciate
intelligent men and the poor devil is so homophobic that will never leave
the closet, even more the box, hahaha!!  ;D
Regards to your fictional "happy family", James.  Hope you are not the
father of some of your grandchildren, bad seed guy!  Ugh, it's a pretty

it's a possibility to be seriously considered...  :(((

probably not read James' messages and his personal attacks to me or
purposely ignored them.  He criticized only my answers and, well, his
aggressive public reaction was a really precious lesson to me.
**I swear I will never try to help another unknown and foreign runaway
hacker, depressed enough for considering killing himself, sincerely
offering my home and my personal contacts to give him some support.**
He could simply give me a sincere heads up in private about my messages,
honestly criticizing them and their content, when, only some weeks ago,
contacted me in private asking about me.  I was so, really so happy for
knowing his personal storm was apparently finished and he was doing
good...  I was very stupid.
Well, not my problem anymore.  He knows very well how much I do hate false
and hypocrite persons and I will never trust him again.  Really sorry for
wasting my time last year, reading his "pathetic" private messages asking
for help and answering to them when he was feeling deeply sad and lost.
I hate the sensation of being humiliated in public for someone that I used
to trust, someone who used to be my friend, but it is evidently **not** a
problem for him, so he will not waste his time reading this message and
giving it an answer.  Anyway, he died for me yesterday and I think a
supposed "badass hacker" knows very well how to create messages filters.
Wish you all a lovely day.  I will lurk for some time because it will
certainly be much healthier for me.

it's OK to post White Supremacist and Nazi content, but it's really
shocking to mention sex.  It's f_cking creepy and unfair because James'

So James, how long have you been experiencing these bizarre delusions?
Have you have any visual or auditory hallucinations?  Have you reported
them to your psychologist or psychiatrist?
Steve, my lovely friend, is pretty obvious James had no psychological
and/or psychiatriac support until now.
James has a so sick and disturbing vision about single women and having
several children that makes possible to think seriously about an early
Oedipus Complex.
Well, Oedipus was the first, the original "motherf_cker".   I think it's a
pretty good way of describing James using one single word, but I bet he
never satisfied his sexual dreams while a kid because he's obviously also a
real "son of a b_tch" and probably could not pay his own mommy's prices, a
single woman working very, very hard with harder things...
Tsk, tsk...  Sad life history.  Search for medical support, James.  It can
be very traumatic never discover who was your father and having so bad
references about single women like your dear mommy...  :((

Today is January, 10, 2018, and this guy is still talking about "Christmas
present" to offend a non-Christian person, aff...  :((
Z.H. is always so miserably s-l-o-w that will wish a "Happy New Year" to
the members list in the next month or maybe in the next semester.  Another
good example of the dead slug's velocity around the world.
This kind of grotesque delay can indicate a lot of mental diseases.  Search
for psychiatric help with urgency, please.

@_subject: [OT] [song] "Young Souls" - Broken Back (was Re: Fire & Fury pdf) 
It's much better to be a "young soul", still pure, innocent, dreaming
about a world where people won't be judged by their race, gender,
religion, sexual preferences, etc, than becoming soulless, old at
heart, bitter, and hateful.
Some guys should spend more time searching for a really good
psychiatric support and an urgent treatment for dyslexia instead of
sending fake news and messages supporting all the possible kinds of
stupid prejudices.
Hmm, the CP list's dyslexic "genius" is very, very slow and probably
does not know what means "dyslexia"...  :-/
Better to give him a link with easy and fast information or the
"infinite delay guy" will never understand why he is not able to write
Shawn, John, and Lauren's names correctly, or making a simple and
correct interpretation of their posts, without modifying the original
texts, adding and/or removing important parts of them, aff...  ;P
Intellectual fraud is not accepted in my country, but I don't know how
it works in Australia.  Does it exist in your country, "Harkless"?  I
know you prefer to talk about Dump's "tonic masculinity"  - wow, that
was a really ridiculous message, but you are finally leaving your
homophobic closet, hahaha!!! -  however the "very stable genius" will
never be your "alpha male".  So sorry for you, but "Dump" prefers to
grab pussies...  Meow!  ;D
Wish you all a lovely weekend, la la la!  <3
PS:  -  "Harkless".  "Dump".  My temporary dyslexia is uncomfortable
for you,  "ZenNein"?  Hope so!  :D
"Young Souls" - Broken Back
We're walking through the lands
Pure souls and dreams ahead
Tell the world here we are
A thousand miles away
We've traveled to, so far to play
We've put our fears aside
A thousand miles away from home
We are the young souls and proud to be so, every day
Tell them we are, tell them we are
We're on the way
We won't stop, we won't stop growing everyday
Tell them we are, tell them we are
We're on the way
We are the young souls and proud to be so, every day
Tell them we are, tell them we are
We're on the way
We're walking through the lands
Pure souls and dreams ahead
Tell the world here we are
Romantic adventurers we seek to discover
What the world has to hide
A thousand miles away
We've traveled to, so far to play
We've put our fears aside
A thousand miles away
We've traveled to, so far to play
We've come to sing out loud
A thousand miles away from home
We are the young souls and proud to be so, every day
Tell them we are, tell them we are
We're on the way
We won't stop, we won't stop growing everyday
Tell them we are, tell them we are
We're on the way
We are the young souls and proud to be so, every day
Tell them we are, tell them we are
We're on the way
We won't stop, we won't stop growing everyday
Tell them we are, tell them we are

various vanity tokens and for player high scores with NEM mosaics. Also,
the PacNEM game integrates a Sponsor Engine which showcases how to
implement instant payments in the advertisement industry for daily ad views
with NEM mosaics.
PacNEM uses the NEM blockchain in many different ways and aims to be an
example of possible implementations of NEM features in your games or

payment processing, multi-signature accounts and multi-signature
transaction co-signing – all this without the need of developing in-game
wallets! You can let people play with their own NEM wallets!!"

Hello from Brazil, Shiny Happy TTC People!  :D
May someone give a really good technical answer to my friends, please?  <3
I will need to share the answer about the use of JavaScript with two other
discussion lists, where I also received a "not-so-good" feedback in
private.  Sorry but I am using an euphemism, uh!  :P
Thank you all in advance!  Kisses, hugs, and much love!  <3

        "Sorry!
The Data Detox Kit requires javascript and supports newer versions of
Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. Please enable javascript in your browser
and refresh this page. "
        lawl - so data detox - whatever that means - requires you to

Technically, jewscript allows the execution of arbitrary code.

Thanks for the answer, but I really would like to understand why the TTC
Team made the option for using JavaScript.

@_date: 2018-01-28 23:31:08
@_author: Cecilia Tanaka 
@_subject: "Doublethink Approval Kit" by Ministry of Truth & Pozilla 
Javascript can be, and should be, compiled into caja, which is a safe
subset of Javascript.
Unfortunately, this solution is only available for servers, not end users.
Thank you very much for the unexpected, but sincerely much appreciated
answer, James.  :)
Well, now let's wait for the TTC Team's answer...  Usually, they are pretty
cute!  <3

@_subject: "Doublethink Approval Kit" by Ministry of Truth & Pozilla 
Please do not confuse Java and JavaScript. The only relationship between
the two is that Netscape paid Sun to license the Java trademark to what
was previously known as LiveScript. (This was back when Netscape and Sun
still existed as separate companies, mid-1990s or so.)
Oh, Shawn, my dear, thank you a lot!  <3
Wow, I do need to study coding really hard this year or consider seriously

And this is crazy
But here's my email
So answer me maybe...  :D
Sorry for the cheesy song, but I really appreciated a lot Juan's suggestion
and wanted to share it with you all.  :)
A static page with explanations about the project sounds good for me and
does not seem a too much hard thing...  But, well, I am the kind of
distracted person who thinks a terrible bug can maybe be a new feature,
hahaha!!  ;D
Oh, do not feel offended with Juan's messages at all, please.  He's really
trying to help, I swear!  <3
I am curious about the JavaScript thing.  Why the team made this choice,
please?  :D
Well, wish you all good nights and days, sweet dreams and cozy cuddles...

        If you don't enable javascript that site won't show you any content
at all. They could have put a static page explaining  what the site is
about but apparently they were too lazy to do that.
        And, javascript is the number one tool used to track
and fingerprint browsers so a site about privacy (I'm assuming that's what
the site is about) that refuses to do anything unless javascript is
enabled....looks like a joke.

This book is about something bigger than tech itself. It’s about
information, ownership and control in a digital age. It talks directly to a
number of lives issues, ranging from access to medicines, to the future of
work and privacy, digital monopolies and power in a connected world.
Will the digital revolution give us digital dictatorships or digital
democracies? Forget everything you think you know about the digital age.
It’s not about privacy, surveillance, AI or blockchain—it’s about
*ownership*. Because in a digital age, who owns information controls the
Today’s “Closed” digital economy is the source of problems ranging from the
power of a handful of tech monopolies to control how we think and vote, to
unaffordable medicines, to growing inequality. The solution is not
technological but political: a choice between making information Open,
shared by all, or making it Closed, exclusively owned and controlled.
By choosing Open we can make a more equitable, innovative and profitable
future for all.

But may God protect Trump, and the USA
Sorry, my dear, but God does probably *not* exist.
Hey, I also noticed he gained some weight and become "greater" after
becoming USA's president!  :D
Maybe some pounds more and he can "protect" your country even more, staying
in the place of the the "Great Wall of USA", hahaha!!  ;D
Oh, help the USA, dear probably inexistent God, there is a dangerous
*globalist* agenda!!!  :-o
But every good NORTH-American knows the world is FLAT, why are everyone
talking about globes and global things?!
Globes are spherical and  - wow! -  it's so illogical as believing in
Darwin, instead of the Creationism and the sacred Bible, oooh!!  :-o
Meh, always thought *real* cypherpunks wanted an anarchist world, without
politicians and frontiers...
Yawn...  Boring.  Do your homework and learn a little bit more about
politics and geography, please.  (- _ -) zzzz...
I do agree and wish exactly the same to ALL the other countries:  real

Trump to Hitler.
Well, you are right now.  Hitler was a serial killer, a monster, a devilish
human garbage, but was very intelligent.  Comparing Trump to Hitler is
really offensive to Hitler...  :(
Oh, I can explain the "kkk" thing...  In other countries, the sound of
written loud laugh is expressed in several different ways.  I like to laugh
using "hahaha", but most of the Brazilian people usually laughs "kkk",
"kkkk", or even "kkkkkkkk"!  :D
It is just a different "lol", NOT a support to the  - blargh! -  disgusting

It would be fun to say "I am a very proud  but no way...  It would
not work well here, just in the USA, hahaha!!  ;D
Hey, do you use your official KKK clothes to ask for candies in the
Halloween, pretending to be a ghost?   ;D
Yep, and every single person in this crazy world is a lunatic, including
both of us, my dear.
I am really afraid because my country will probably have its own version of
Trump...  These elections are being so ridiculously irrational and stupid,
Well, it's Spring here...  Maybe it's arrived the Revolution time, yay!  :D

dying man or is in that category, then I suggest that you drop dead unless
you can explain yourself better.
Rape accusations against men are becoming "over hyped", an easy way to get
money in my country.  Here, we had some important cases where women
simulated aggressions - and also allegated rape in some of them - to ask
for millionaire indemnities.
Read about recent Neymar's criminal case.  He is a famous Brazilian soccer
player and lost lots of time and several contracts, supporters, and
merchandising, explaining the obvious: he was being victim of opportunistic
persons and stupid hypocrite SJWs.
Sorry about your problems, darling.  Again, ask for forgiveness and wish
you serenity, inner peace, and happiness.

music, or poetry.  No useful comments or news about interesting subjects.
He only brings hate and discord to this list, to this world.  Sometimes,
life becomes lighter and more pleasant using filters and avoiding to spend

Z. is so proud of being a "white man" and his skin is much darker than
mine  (3 shades, at least),  a Japanese girl living in a pretty hot

he has Black, Muslim, and Jewish blood too.  It would be a honor for me,

My dearest Punk,
Shawn was just trying to help Spanish non-speakers probably interested on
this topic about censorship and Wikipedia.  No evil intentions.
I will have a little medical operation in a few hours, still because of the
pretty violent assault suffered last year.  So I am really sorry, but today
will exactly not be the best moment to contact Internet Archive.
I know some people there and - wow! - they are amazing persons working in
an f*cking astonishing project.  Really admire all of them and the
archive.org .  I think they - maybe? - can bring some light to this
Deeply sorry from the bottom of my heart, but I didn't read this thread and
the Wikipedia deleted page discussion with attention because I am a bit
anxious about medical operations, hospitals, pains, medicines, more medical
exams, uff...  :(
My Spanish is probably better than Shawn's, so I will understand much
better the whole hysterical discussion and the censorship.
I love Wikipedia, but hate 98% of their moderators.  Hmm...  Maybe 99% of
them, considered the whole world.  Already tried to update pages in
Portuguese, Italian, English, French, and Spanish about Japanese and/or
Brazilian subjects.  Conclusion?  They think I don't know much about
Brazilian and Japanese cultures.  (-_-) meh!
Tender kisses and warm hugs...  Lovely days and nights, dear all.

Thank you for worrying about Ryan's mental, psychological, and
physical health.  I don't know him, we are not friends, but his
suffering is visible and it's sweet of you to show some compassion and
support to a person in need.   It's his cry for help and I don't know
how to help him.
Well , Razer ...  This song is pretty scary but beautiful and
interesting at the same time, my dear beloved.  Thank you very much
for sharing this little treasure with the list!  <3
I also love you, even when you prefer to send kisses only to Juan,
hahaha!!  I confess I felt a little bit jealous, but it is impossible
to compete with him: he is always much more charming than me,
hahahaha...  ;D
My dearest pumpkin grarpamp, I loved the music but not much the joke
about Naruto run...  It's a bit strange, but Naruto's running was
scientifically already proved as very efficient.  Wow, man, it 's
tricky, you know, hahaha!!!  ;D
Juan, I know you do not care about my opinion, but I do trust and
respect Greg and Riad.  Seriously, they are very brave, kind, and
patient.   Real CypherPunks, my love.
M, S, a, J, et al, I am still alive, but almost gave up and gone this
time with an insane physical and the most devasting emotional pain
that I could only imagine for several different reasons.  Two new
surgeries next week.  Being honest, something already died inside me,
and it was one of my best, my dearest qualities.  I will miss my lost
innocence, some of my dearest dreams, and my most sincere hopes about
part of humanity.  My heart is broken and I am hurt.
Well, I will need to take some time for healing and finally, feel
better.  In this meanwhile, you all can summon my big bad bro, LooLoo.
Lucifer is - pretty obviously! - a lawyer too.  Much better than me,
but has curious theories about religions. He does believe in God and
says he saw His/Her face in person, shining in absolute splendor, and
talking to him.  Well, some people say it's true faith.  I call
"schizophrenia" or "mental dementia"...  :P
Just an excerpt from "Crying For Help" lyrics...
"I wandered around
The streets of this town
Trying to find sense in it all
The rain on my face
It covers the trace
Of all the tears
I've had to waste
Why must we hide emotions?
Why must we never break down and cry?
All that I need
Is to cry for help
Somebody please hear me
Cry for help
All I can do"
Is cry for help
No need to feel ashamed
Release the pain
Cry for help"
But my broken heart is singing this song in the last days...
"Don't wanna to give my heart away
To another stranger
Or let another day begin
Won't even let the sunlight in
No, I'll never love again
I'll never love again, ooh..."

It's a Brazilian song for kids and John was joking with me, my dear,
because the original Nobunaga Oda was a brilliant warrior, a good
strategist, but had no patience and, in several moments, acted like a
psycho killer.  No mercy.  He killed until the last child of his enemies to
have absolute certain they will never grown up and search for revenge.
It would be fun to imagine Oda singing "The History Of A Kitten" for
children, but he used to teach his kids to fight until the death, with
blood, honor, and no mercy.  Sparta feelings, baby!  ;)
This song is about freedom, about being really happy.
"História de Uma Gata"
(Canção de Nara Leão e Os Saltimbancos)
Me alimentaram
Me acariciaram
Me aliciaram
Me acostumaram
O meu mundo era o apartamento
Detefon, almofada e trato
Todo dia filé-mignon
Ou mesmo um bom filé... de gato
Me diziam, todo momento
Fique em casa, não tome vento
Mas é duro ficar na sua
Quando à luz da lua
Tantos gatos pela rua
Toda a noite vão cantando assim
Nós, gatos, já nascemos pobres
Porém, já nascemos livres
Senhor, senhora ou senhorio
Felino, não reconhecerás
De manhã eu voltei pra casa
Fui barrada na portaria
Sem filé e sem almofada
Por causa da cantoria
Mas agora o meu dia-a-dia
É no meio da gataria
Pela rua virando lata
Eu sou mais eu, mais gata
Numa louca serenata
Que de noite sai cantando assim
Nós, gatos, já nascemos pobres
Porém, já nascemos livres
Senhor, senhora ou senhorio
Felino, não reconhecerás

Yeah, he was a disgusting politician of his time, basically a serial
killer.  He used alive persons just to test their new swords.  They should
cut bones and flesh so fast and softly as possible.
I already tried 'kenjutsu' and 'kendo', John.  There are always "free
teachers" for those who are able to show their soul for complete and have
real discipline.  I think a training with a sword shows more about a
person's character than beautiful words about honor, loyalty, respect and
justice, the real pillars of the warrior in my humble opinion.  I bet you
and Juan will love it.  It's deeply beautiful, I swear.
My deceased Italian fiance, my first love, was an archer.  A really good
one.  But I've meet another archer much better in my own country.  And he's
one of the best Brazilian security researchers.  Sounds strange, but he's
so pure, so innocent and sweet...  A great and generous soul.  I wish him
all the happiness of this world and he will never know it.  This little
secret makes me smile when I read about him.
It's completely OT, sorry, but now I am missing some ghosts of the past.
Hope to dream a little dream about them...  Do you like Sandman?  :)

Juan is the man of my life.  I am completely in love and this strong
passion burns my heart and soul.  <3
My mom is very happy because they have the same taste for anime and he
understands Japanese much better than me.  Both think Evangelion is boring,
meh!  :((
My dad is satisfied because Juan loves meat and daddy thinks he will be a

I love you, Juan.  Thank you for liking Evangelion and sorry for my

For Darwin's sake, already have enough bad karma to my all eventual next

Oh, thanks a lot, my sweet, but this guy here  (

He is a little bit much older than me and doesn't live in Denver,
Colorado.  He prefers the sunny Florida and doesn't like social life very
much.  So, until I recall, he never had accounts on Instagram and Twitter,
at least.
The unique address that he used on this list and in our private
conversations was .  And pilobilus.net’s server IP
address could not be found.  The message that I've sent to him a few days
ago returned, accusing "servfail".
He and Mirimir are the only friends I have who know why I hate ukuleles so
much, hahaha!!  Pretty traumatic experience, brrr...
Steve is a very sweet person, who loves books and a wild cat who adopted
him as "owner".  Pretty gorgeous feline, much more intelligent than me, but
the owner was the cat, Steve was just his human pet, hihihi...  ;)
I still miss Anthony Papillon.  He was a gentleman and when he stopped to
answer my personal messages, I was worried, but with no news or clues about
him.  Knowing about his death talking to another friend was pretty painful

Wikileaks Speaker: Jacob Applebaum
Jacob Applebaum Australia FEB 2012
My lovely pumpkin,
I am very grateful for always being loyal to Jake, but his last name is
"Appelbaum", not "Applebaum".
It's a very usual typo and to annoy me an InfoSec guy loved to call him
"maçãzinha" ("little apple", in Portuguese).  He used to call Jake
something's like "Ceci's little apple".
He is one of the greatest professionals of InfoSec in my country, but he is
also emotionally more retarded than me and very cruel sometimes.  In
special, with me and any of my friends.
Well, this guy was one of the reasons for leaving the hackerspace and its
public discussion list exactly when Jake's problems with The Tor Project
became public.
I still love the hackerspace and will never lose for complete this feeling,
but I remember this jerk and the hypocrite SJW who lies to everybody, and
pretends to be a "real feminist", and pseudo-BBF of one of my
ex-boyfriends  (the famous one, with "excellent connections"),  but begged
some dozens of times to have anal sex with me in the hackerspace, even
living with his fiancée, actual wife.
I know my ex-boyfriend would never believe in me because when one of his
really best friends raped me, he preferred to believe in him.  It still
f... hurts.
And I never told the complete story to anyone, except Jake, because wanted
to protect my ex's public reputation.  I will always try to protect him.  I
sincerely loved him for years and the love is ended, but my loyalty will
last until my death because my ex deserves it.
The same about Jake.  I will always be loyal to him because he deserves my
respect and consideration.
He never was my "little apple", but I love him and apples.  You know I love
pumpkins too, hahaha!!  ;D
Well, living sometimes is pretty unfair...  Uff...  :-/

Simple ways to sleuth out statistical errors
Statistical errors are all too common in medical literature, and contribute
to the reproducibility crisis currently plaguing science. Fortunately, you
don’t need a degree in statistics to catch these errors. While some errors
are impossible to spot without access to the underlying dataset, many are
detectable just by reviewing the information available in the paper. In
many cases nothing more than common sense and simple arithmetic is
required. In addition, there is an ever-increasing number of free,
easy-to-use online statistical tools that facilitate error detection.
In this session, Dr. Sainani will demonstrate how to apply these
statistical sleuthing tools using real examples from medical literature.
She will also review principles of effective statistics that can help
prevent statistical errors from occurring in the first place.
You will learn:

I think this contest can be very interesting for some people here.  No, not
because of the prizes, but because they can help to save lives.
Please, help to avoid great losses for the humanity like this one...  :'(
Conway was simply amazing.  Please, honor all the people who changed this
world for better, with their knowledge, researching, and Science
discoveries in all areas.  Honor their lives and their deaths helping those
who are still here, those who can still be saved...  <3
Wish you all much love, inspiration, and good luck, my beloved ones!  <3

The COVID-19 Detect & Protect Challenge with Hackster
COVID-19 is an unprecedented global health and humanitarian emergency,
which threatens to create devastating social, economic, and political
crises. In some of the world's most vulnerable areas, the impact could be
catastrophic. This extraordinary situation demands innovation and ingenuity
from the best and brightest of humanity, wherever it may be found.
Today, the United Nations Development Programme is announcing the *COVID-19
Detect and Protect Challenge
in partnership with Hackster and some of the world's leading technology
We're calling on the community to support developing countries through the
sharing and transfer of open source technology. This challenge has three
priority actions:
   - Design replicable, low-cost tools and resources to aid viral detection
   - Flatten the curve in communities with preventive solutions
   - Reduce the disease's impact on the economies of these vulnerable areas
The 10 best entries will receive a $1,000 Visa gift card, an NXP HoverGames
drone and telemetry radio, and most importantly, a Global UNDP Innovator
Award badge and certificate.

Please, calm your heart and breath slowly, darling.  Everything is okay

about your emails?  Hahaha!!  ;D
You do _not_ need to copy anyone to your answers, but you can copy me if it
makes you feel more comfortable, more secure and warm in this moment.  <3
Just relax and be calm, please.  There is life outside, out the lists, out
the blockchains, out the Internet.  This list is strangely cute and I also
love it, but try to get some fresh air.  It will be healthy for you, dear.
Greg is a very lovely person and pretty, pretty busy.  He donates a lot of
time and patience for managing this list adequately and I admire him really
a lot.  I don't know what happened about your message, but don't be
annoyed, everything is alright.  Nothing personal, nothing for losing your
sleep or wasting your time creating crazy conspiracy theories, please...  :P
Well, I will be silent, trying to sleep.  Sorry, I am always trying to
sleep because I have a very brutal insomnia, and I am happier when I have
water, food, and sleep.  Choose wisely your priorities in the life,
darling.  Without enough sleep, my bad mood is epic!  Without Internet,
it's even worse!  I seem a furious devastating monster, grrr...
Hahahaha!!  ;D

No success in fast searches, but the word remembers a kind of Brazilian
"tsukemono".  :)
Sorry, making searches using a temperamental cellphone is annoying and I
don't remember the English word for "tsukemono" (Japanese).
And why "rub shoulders", please?  My search gave me some "eeck,

Juan is a very interesting maker and cooks really well.  I am always buying
different chocolates for him because he likes the taste and is more
creative than me.  I don't like bitter choco with salt and caramel, for

and honey, hahaha!!!  ;D
I keep them with me, waiting for a visit, but when my mood is terrible or
he is annoying me on the list, I tell him I will eat all his chocolates,

The older members know 'mal cojido' is Spanish and 'baka' or 'bakka' is

*Patti Smith - People Have The Power*
I was dreaming in my dreaming
Of an aspect bright and fair
And my sleeping it was broken
But my dream it lingered near
In the form of shining valleys
Where the pure air recognized
And my senses newly opened
I awakened to the cry
That the people / have the power
To redeem / the work of fools
Upon the meek / the graces shower
It's decreed / the people rule
The people have the power
The people have the power
The people have the power
The people have the power
Vengeful aspects became suspect
And bending low as if to hear
And the armies ceased advancing
Because the people had their ear
And the shepherds and the soldiers
Lay beneath the stars
Exchanging visions
And laying arms
To waste / in the dust
In the form of / shining valleys
Where the pure air / recognized
And my senses / newly opened
I awakened / to the cry
Where there were deserts
I saw fountains
Like cream the waters rise
And we strolled there together
With none to laugh or criticize
And the leopard
And the lamb
Lay together truly bound
I was hoping in my hoping
To recall what I had found
I was dreaming in my dreaming
God knows / a purer view
As I surrender to my sleeping
I commit my dream to you
The power to dream / to rule
To wrestle the world from fools
It's decreed the people rule
It's decreed the people rule
I believe everything we dream
Can come to pass through our union
We can turn the world around
We can turn the earth's revolution
We have the power
People have the power ...

  Coderman was promoting cloudflare-NSA. Explain why coderman is working
 Juan, it would be f* illogical.  Are you forgetting I donated my f* DNA
for trying to save lives?!
Sh*t, I've already sold my soul to the devil, friend.  I was not joking or
creating new conspiracy theories just for fun.
I know it was f* f* f* stupid, but one single life can be much more
precious than mine.
Oliver Sachs, for example, could save the sanity and the life of one of my
best friends, but he is dead.  Fucking definitely dead.  And only thing I
can do for my friend is sending daily songs and music because the disease
is faster than his doctors, than my researches with three Medical School
students  (crazy volunteers who know about my insane reputation),  than all
my fears...
Can you imagine how I would feel without music or sounds?  My parents'
voice or the sound of the storms?  I love rain, but the storms have a
special place in my heart.  All the f* sounds have a special place in my
heart.  My friend only wants to hear his kids, his wife, his parents...  I
am much more worried about my sick friend, my parents, my siblings,
everybody who is really important for me than about "Oh, what the
Cypherpunks List will think about my wise cypherpunk magical colorful
We all know I fucked my whole life and compromised the security of some
operations "giving" my DNA, but unfortunately my f* stupid government got
it last year, anyway.  So, now I will destroy governments in my own way.
And maybe using my DNA!  ;)
Science, Juan.  It's my religion.  Always remember it.  Well, I almost
married with the Flying Spaghetti Monster blessings, but Pasta is
Perfection.  And Cooking is Science too!  :P

girl.  An exotic Oriental girl, pretty cute.  The fear of finally fainting
when you are really exhausted and waking up with a man over you...  Oh, the
ol' good days...
And the menstruation is a very embarrassing thing.  Blood can be very scary
for some people.  I do not care about broken bones or worse things, but
some people become crazy when see blood and you were not ready for this.
I am still the same, Juan, but you are becoming bitter and forgetting who I
am behind the pink hair and all the roses, music and poetry...  I have

While you are reading this, someone somewhere is working on improving the
code of a Free Software you use yourself. Although millions of users depend
on Free Software, the people behind the respective projects usually remain
invisible. Together we want to change that. 14 February, the "I love Free

Behind every Free Software project is a team of developers, translators and
designers. These are people who fix bugs, make improvements and provide
security updates. They do a great service to our society by making the code
of their software available to the general public. This cannot be taken for
granted. Many of these people do it voluntarily in their spare time. But
how often do we actually thank them for this?
14 February is "I love Free Software" day. On this day, Free Software users
are called upon to show their appreciation for a project of their choice.
It's easy to join in: just write a short message of thanks on the social
network of your choice with the addition  Or write a short thank
you email to a development team. The message does not have to be long - a
simple thank you is often enough. Do you think it's important for
journalists to be able to research the web anonymously with Tor? Do you
regularly use the Firefox browser, LibreOffice, or a Linux system yourself?
Or is there a smaller and less known project that you personally care
about? You alone decide who you want to please on this day. On the "I love
Free Software Day" action page you will find various ideas and suggestions:
Action page: ilovefs.org
The "I love Free Software Day" is an important institution in the Free
Software community. The more people participate, the more we can make it
clear that we value this work, which is immensely important for our
society. We would therefore be very pleased if you too would take part and
take a moment on 14 February.

gesture means a lot to many people. As FSFE we regularly get feedback from

of strength and encourages them to continue. All the more reason why we

Nasa, or at Google.  The human being is very strange in their choices.
My friends deserve my sincere love e devotion.  I don't feel comfortable
anymore about Google and will change a lot of things soon, but my loyalty
is only for my friends, not for the company where they work.
The same about Nasa.  Do you remember how you loved to call my Nasa friends

I respect their work, but I know that there are very strange things
happening.  I just can wait for the best, but taking care about all the
worst options for the future.
Tender kisses, straight hugs, and much love for you...  <3

too.  And "she" is ugly even using filters for pics, aff...
I do not care about her external ugliness, but she has more vanity and
egocentrism than Lucifer.  Her soul is rotten and she has not a heart.  Her
soul is ugly too.
She can lie and pretend to be kind when she wants, but is a just a stupid
psychopath, a bad actress, trying to spread hate against Black people,
Jews, Muslims, Women (cis and trans), and everybody more intelligent than
her.  Oh, almost the whole humanity!  :D
Well, I prefer to forget SleaZen's existence forever, because she's a toxic
troll, a fire garbage, and a non interesting subject for us, my dear.

you.  The world needs of love and more people like you, not like me.
Do Not Dare To Die Before Me, OK?  Or I will travel and kick your coffin

(Yep, I know I told Jake the same thing, but he has insomnia and nightmares
all the nights and days...  Exactly like me.  Living can be very traumatic
and keeping ourselves alive hurt a lot.)
Your beauty is in your soul, your kind - and sometimes broken - heart.
Well, you still have a heart.  My heart is not mine anymore.  When he left
me alone, he took my heart and dreams with him.
Lawyers don't have a heart, but I used to have one and the sensation was so
sweet, warm, and comfortable.  Living was so easy and all the days were
beautiful, even the catastrophic ones.  I miss my heart and, even years
ago, I am simply not hurt, my love...  I am dead inside.

Oh, sorry, my fault!  Never remember to use filters or photo programs to
make me look me desperately miserable.  This is the reason I like this
pic.  It's just me and a Totoro hat.
Devastating physical pain and considerable emotional pain too.  It hurts,
it is frustrating when, after years trying to discover what is happening
with your body, you finally receive an answer, and do need to fight against
the State and the private health plan you contracted a decade ago and is f*
expensive.  Just for economic reference, I could use this money for
visiting you once a month before all the COVID-19 stuff.
At least, I do love my lawyer.  When I look to the mirror, she still smiles
to me, even working for free.  I am an egocentric bastard and I still
remember how life is sweet when you don't feel any pain.  First, I will get
the freedom back for me.  After it, without pain, I will try to get the
same sweet sensation for other people.  Nobody deserves to feel pain and/or
fear, darling.
In the moment, I am not a so good writer like I used to be and it's pretty
scary for me.  In the last three months, my doctor and I tried several
medicines for avoiding the extreme levels of pain, but the chemicals make
my writing so... hmm...  meh!  :-/
And there are stupid mistakes, specially in French, because I learn a
language using its sounds first, not its writing...  Or, at least, try to
do it.  Sorry, my fault, I know I am a disaster with all languages, in
special German Sauerkraut recipes!  My last try exploded in the kitchen a
few days ago and my nose is still screaming, full of horror...  :-/
(Do you remember my past Sauerkraut disasters, Mirimir?  Tor-Talk list
before being kickbanned, for example, hahahaha!!)
So, I prefer the pain and a, more or less, decent writing in Brazilian
Portuguese, my native language, even being slower.  My English always
stinks, with or without pain, so no considerable problem.
I just need time and patience for learning a bit more about Medicine.

(There will be a scar, but he will try to preserve my tattoo.)
He is a spinal surgeon, darling.  And I didn't tell my parents I can die or
become paraplegic after the last surgery.  I just want to be a butterfly
again and get my freedom back.
I was an hyperactive child and was banned of schools because of it.  I love
to walk for hours while thinking about a new idea or a problem.  Can you
mesure the deep intensity of my fear of losing my movements?   :((
I was shocked.  At same time, he gave me an answer and new perspectives.  I
wanted it more than everything at that point.  Certainly, it was not a good
answer, but I had finally a rational justification for the strong pains
able to make me fainting, able to make my lovely always low blood pressure
becoming crazily high in some moments...
My body was/is so fucking healthy that most of doctors simply said it was
stress, maybe psychological pain...  Sorry, my body and I never were needy
enough for pretending to be sick for getting attention.  And, well, I do
love my body.  It survived to real sick shit and is keeping me alive very,
very well.  Amazing healing capacity, wow...
Something was wrong and now I know what is and it makes me pretty happy.  I
can't fix it by myself, but life is funnier than ever because I know I
won't die:  I will run on beaches again, watching the sea and the sun
rising, darling.
(I just need to win a judicial battle first...  'Meh' things, you know.  I
am wasting my precious time with bureaucracy, aff...)
And yes, we are very complicated machines. But fortunately, we're also
Sorry, learned to analyze spinal exams in the last months and, well, I love

I am not able to operate my own back, even using mirrors or whatever...  I

help this time, Mirimir!  :((

in the end.  Hundreds of times in the last months.  Literally.  I got more
2 deaths today - number 199 and 200 - and decided it was enough.  I am
feeling dead.
Yep, my body's answer to viruses can be very fun.  This one, for example,
will never kill me.  Sorry, already tasted stronger flavours.  Not a
pleasent experience, of course.  My blood was and is being used in medical
researches and it is a bit annoying.  Gave researches some samples, gave a
friend a donation - cancer, 500 ml - and, well, already did it before two
weeks ago, donating blood to a public hospital.  So, I seem dead too.  Pale
and cold.
Well, there are dozens, and dozens, and more dozens of lovely cute
survivors too.  But they are wasted like me.
Now, I ask apologies to the whole list.  I did a lot of stupid noise here
in the last days because I am a stupid OT person with an stupid OT life.
And because I wanted desperately to annoy 2  (or more, don't know,
whatever)  stalkers.
Uncomfortable sensation, I needed help, sorry.  One of them is deeply _out_
my life, so I am less stressed and will try to sleep.  And eating _decent_
choco because I need to celebrate my f* luck.  Sh*t, it seems so wrong and
immoral doing it today, but...  well, the future can be cancelled still
today...  or tomorrow...  or never...  who can know?
So, take care and try to be happy, boys and girls.  And after 7 July, I
absolutely recommend the "Plague Songs" album.  It's indecent, immoral,

PS:  - Just in case, I was not using stupid masks.  They were feeling bad
and, in some way, watching my face was comfortable to most of them,
specially the children.  They always think I am funny.
I gave up Criminology area when much younger, before ending the Law degree,
because of a kid's corpse.  It was fucking brutal watching it.  His father
should protect and love him, not kill him.  It was the second dead child of
my life and definitely it was enough, but had to watch more children
corpses in the last months.  And lots and lots of people older and younger
than me.
And, I ask pardon, but now I am completely sure that my life is a
disgraceful shit, but I do love it.  I do love being alive.  It's always
fucking interesting and my memories are part of who I am now.  My memories,
fears, and traums can be scary or sad, but are important part of my life.
So I can live with them pretty well, I think.  Or I die trying it.  ;)

@_subject: [OSI] [ESR] Open Source Iniciative bans co-founder, Eric S. Raymond. 
Open Source Initiative bans co-founder, Eric S Raymond
 Mar 9, 2020
Last week, Eric S Raymond (often known as ESR
, author of The Cathedral
and the Bazaar ,
and co-founder of the Open Source Intiative
) was banned from the
Open Source Intiative (the “OSI”).
Specifically, Raymond was banned from the mailing lists used to organize
and communicate with the OSI.
For an organization to ban their founder from communicating with the group
(such as via a mailing list) is a noteworthy move.
At a time when we have seen other founders (of multiple Free and Open
Source related initiatives) pushed out of the organizations they founded
(such as with Richard Stallman being compelled to resign from the Free
Software Foundation, or the attempts to remove Linus Torvalds from the
Linux Kernel – both of which happened within the last year) it seems worth
taking a deeper look at what, specifically, is happening with the Open
Source Initiative.
I don't wish to tell any of you what you should think about this
significant move. As such I will simply provide as much of the relevant
information as I can, show the timeline of events, and reach out to all
involved parties for their points of view and comments.
Raymond made the following statement, on February 27, 2020, on his personal
blog :
“I – OSI’s co-founder and its president for its first six years – was
kicked off their lists for being too rhetorically forceful in opposing
certain recent attempts to subvert OSD clauses 5 and 6. This despite the
fact that I had vocal support from multiple list members who thanked me for
being willing to speak out.
It shouldn’t be news to anyone that there is an effort afoot to change – I
would say corrupt – the fundamental premises of the open-source culture.
Instead of meritocracy and “show me the code”, we are now urged to behave
so that no-one will ever feel uncomfortable.
The effect – the intended effect – is to diminish the prestige and autonomy
of people who do the work – write the code – in favor of self-appointed
tone-policers. In the process, the freedom to speak necessary truths even
when the manner in which they are expressed is unpleasant is being
gradually strangled.
And that is bad for us. Very bad. Both directly – it damages our
self-correction process – and in its second-order effects. The habit of
institutional tone policing, even when well-intentioned, too easily slides
into the active censorship of disfavored views.”
So what, exactly, prompted this extreme measure? What could happen that
would be so problematic that an organization would ban their founder (and
one of the most well known individuals in the Open Source world)?
Thankfully the Open Source Initiative keeps a public archive
all the posts to their mailing lists. I did what any journalist would do in
this scenario… I started reading.
And I didn't have to go very far back through the archive, either. Turns
out the first post (in a very long time) from Raymond was 3 short days
before he was banned (and before the blog post he penned above).
February 24th, 2020. Raymond posted the following
an OSI mailing list with the title “A wild co-founder appears”:
“After twenty years of staying off this list, I have joined it.
I didn't, until now, because whenever I checked in on this list the
regulars seemed to be doing the job I expected them to do quite
competently. And I had enough of an “I can't be everywhere, dammit!”
problem without adding to it.
But there are two recent developments I find concerning that have convinced
me I need to weigh in. Please pay careful attention, as I am not making
this choice [lightly].
I will start individual threads for both issues.”
What followed from there were several posts by Eric Raymond over the next
two days – having conversations on multiple topics relating to Open Source
licensing and how the OSI should handle potential revoking of certification
of licenses.
Some of the messages had strong disagreements over OSI policy. However, I
was unable to find any messages, from Raymond (or anyone else) that would
(based on my understanding of the Code of Conduct
 that the OSI has adopted
for their mailing lists) constitute a banning… of a founder or of any
regular member.
Then, on February 26, 2020, “Moderator at OpenSource.org” posted the following
The OSI Board is aware that some offensive emails have been sent to this
list. The OSI does not tolerate deliberately divisive or disrespectful
messages from any quarter. We have already taken moderation actions to this
effect and we will apply further sanctions if necessary.
No further details were provided, making this difficult to verify.
The next day (February 27, 2020), Josh Berkus (a Red Hat employee and
regular speaker at Open Source conferences) posted the following
ESR's “sharp language” is not an attempt to persuade. It is an attempt to
intimidate opponents; to “win” an argument by making others afraid to
participate. Indeed, even today OSI mailing list composition is entirely
folks with enough privilege to be resistant to personal attacks. That's a
sad, terrible thing.
It's not “free speech” when it's an attempt to shout others down so that
they have no voice. It's something else entirely.
Further, not one of ESR's points is original or even original to this list.
In his absence, not one of the ideas he so “colorfully” expressed will be
lost. In the meantime, we're missing the input of so many people who will
not participate in OSI because of our tolerance for wholly uncivilized
behavior like his posts.
Followed shortly thereafter (February 28, 2020) by Pamela Chestek (a member
of the OSI Board ) who posted
the following
the OSI Mailing list with the title “Member conduct”:
Following an incident on Open Source Initiative mailing lists, the Board
has removed a subscriber from both the License-Review and License-Discuss
mailing lists for repeatedly violating the Code of Conduct.
The Board took steps to mitigate the issue and began deliberating
immediately after the incident, reached a decision early this morning, and
notified the subscriber of the decision this afternoon.
The Board regrets that some material was published that should not have
been, in spite of our best moderation efforts. We ask for all mailing list
participants to be cautious with the use of CC, BCC, and Reply-All fields
in the future.
Although we have failed in this instance, the OSI continues to work on
making the email lists safe environments where all people and viewpoints
are greeted with an open mind and treated with dignity and respect. OSI has
a broad constituency and that remains a fundamental asset to our mission.
We will be following up in the coming weeks with a more general public
statement about the current state of our moderation efforts, as well as
relevant projects that are in flight. We are grateful for the feedback
we’ve received and welcome further input on our efforts.
We hope that our continued efforts will bring more underrepresented voices
to the table, and that those who left will feel safe returning. We want you
all with us on this journey.
I reached out to the Board and leadership of the Open Source Initiative for
comment, and to provide the quote from Eric Raymond that prompted the
decission to ban him.
As of the writing of this article, I had not yet received any reply from
the Open Source Initiative leadership.
I also reached out to Eric S Raymond to see if he could shed any further
light on the situation and get his views. What follows are his complete
responses to me.
*Lunduke*: Any idea what statement/email you sent that specifically caused
the banning?
*Eric S Raymond*: “They never told me specifically which message was the
In fact, they haven't publicly admitted to banning me, though I got an
email telling me I had been banned.”
*Lunduke*: I've also asked the OSI board the same question (and others)…
but have yet to hear back from them.
*Eric S Raymond*: “Don't hold your breath waiting. Full political
ass-covering mode will be in effect now, and you can quote me on that.
These people are an utter disgrace to the ideals on which I founded OSI.”
*Lunduke*: What do you see as the root cause of the issues you see with the
OSI (which you call out in your blog post )?
*Eric S Raymond*: The fetishization of ‘nice’ behavior, where ‘nice’ ends
up defined as being any behavior some self-appointed censor doesn't like.
Usually (and in this case) accompanied by a lot of bafflegab about
“inclusion” and “diversity” so thay anyone who isn't a fan of the new,
censorious rules can be cast as some sort of bigot.
*Lunduke*: How would you go about fixing those issues?
*Eric S Raymond*: Abolish “Codes of Conduct” and all the Orwellian
doublespeak that goes with them. It's less bad that people sometimes got
their feelings hurt than it is to institutionalize a means by which
dissenting opinions are crushed under the rubric of “not nice”.
Let's take a step back, for a moment, and look at thing from a high level.
Where are we at, as of the writing of this article?
   -
   Eric S Raymond (ESR), one of the founders of the Open Source Initiative,
   has been banned from OSI mailing lists.
   -
   No verifiable reason has been given, by the OSI, for the banning. Based
   on the timeline, presumably the offending message (or messages) would have
   been sent in the two day window between February 24th and February 26th.
   -
   The Open Source Initiative has not responded to a request for
   clarification or comment.
Perhaps interestingly, the Open Source Initiative is right in the middle of an
election for a few of their Board seats .
With such clear and strong conflicts happening between a founder of the OSI
– and some of the current leadership of the OSI – it will be interesting to
see what direction the current OSI leadership and membeship choose to go in.

Hi, Karl.  Nice to meet you.  I think you already know my name is Cecilia
Tanaka and I hope this message can help you a little bit.
When someone very cruel mentions my death, my temperamental health, or my
physical fragility, saying I will die soon, I simply (try to) ignore.  It
happened last week again, when I was trying to help a person who wrote to
the hackerspace begging for attention.  It was unexpected and painful, but
I do not care about dying.  I only care about my loved ones.  So I live
pretty far from my family to keep them safe.
When I am in a chaotical moment, when my body just wants to die, I use
several alarms to keep me alive.  Alarms for meals, for drinking water, for
taking medicines, for taking showers, for sleeping, and also for waking
up.  You are the master of your body, so please keep it working in a
satisfactory way.
Remember:  -  You need hydration, food, and sleep to keep alive and sane.
Please, try to keep your sanity.  You will need it to destroy companies and
governments in the future.
I love World of Warcraft, thank you a lot for your anonymous efforts.  You
love games.  I think I have no many good things in this moment.
Hmm, I think I still have some cyberpunk games, like Orwell, but now it
would not be healthy for you.  It made me feel afraid of the future the
same way like "COVID-1984".  A pandemia was the perfect excuse to all the
governments spy our activities and I do hate this horribly crazy dystopia.
Do you like books, comics, movies, series, jokes, music, something I can
(try to) get for you?  Sorry, I don't know anything about you, but I want
to help you to calm yourself.  Already had very stressful moments and
surviving to them alone is always hard.
Search for comfortable things.  Comfy food, those easy foods to take like
soups, yoghurt, sandwiches, etc;  comfy drinks like no-caffeine tea, hot
chocolate, pure water, fresh juices;  and try to relax your mind reading,
listening music, doing something that you really appreciate. Writing,
drawing, painting, coding, having sex and/or masturbation...
Don't forget to sleep, please.  It's very important.  When I don't sleep,
after three days, my writing and my memory become so confused, living is so
strange...  The sensation is scarier than you can imagine.
Feel free to contact me in private and keep breathing, Karl.  Just remember
I am not online in all moments.
Tender kisses and straight hugs!  Be well and take care, please!  <3

Hi, Karl...  I will answer to you in private tomorrow.  Sorry for being so
late, but needed to visit the hospital because of a really strong and
inconvenient migraine.  My usual medicines didn't work and I was taking
them since yesterday.  :P
Not a good thing, but I need to consider several facts.  I had almost no
sleep since the last Tuesday and my insomnia is a powerful trigger to
migraines.  That's the reason why I am always complaining about feeling
sleepy too, hihihi...  :)
Well, I like hugs and snugglehugs, but only when I like the person who is
hugging me.  I try to avoid touching people who I cannot trust or like.
Bad energies, unpleasant vibes...
Please, do NOT stay away from your family.  Never do it.  I talk to my
parents all the days and receive daily blessings when my day begins and
when it is finished.  It's very comfortable to receive their wishes of good
days and good nights.
I put some physical distance because my family needs peace.  This way, I
don't need to explain a lot of bad things and they are secure.
Well, I don't use Facebook, sorry.  Even my Twitter account is a bit
paused.  I only use it to say hello in private to some friends or just for
lurking.  I am avoiding conflicts.
Hmm...  Let's find a way to send messages for you.  I need to find a way to
make my Session account works better in my cellphone.  I need to talk with
a great friend there, but the app is still a bit unstable and I have some
bad news for sharing.
I keep my dreams in a secret piece of my heart, but I can tell you I love
the sea, music, books, rain, storms, fire, blades, movies, comics/manga,
animation/anime, bad jokes, puns...  hahahahaha!!!  ;D
(Sorry, always laugh when I say "I love puns" because "puns" means "farts"
in Portuguese.  I don't like farts, hahaha!!!)
I love so many things...  Flowers, fruits, plants, animals, children,
watching stars and the moon, sleeping without nightmares, traveling,
knowing new places, visiting again the old ones...  I love breathing.  It
sounds fool, but breathing well makes me very very happy!  :D
I love walking around, meditation, learning new interesting things, being
alone...  I always loved being alone since I can remember.  I never feel
lonely, but it doesn't happen with everybody, I know, so I like to annoy my
friends too.  ;)
I love the complete absence of physical and emotional pains, but I don't
know a word to name it.  Maybe "peace"?  :)
I fall in love all the days.  A puppy asking to play, a kitten purring, a
new colorful flower, an interesting book, sweet people, kids playing,
lovely songs, a comfortable tree...  I like to hide myself in trees for
reading and eating their fruits, hahaha!!!  ;D
I love potable water, ear plugs, sleep masks, taking baths and showers, and
all the lovely smells.  I also love my teddy bear.  He was my Christmas
gift when I was 5 years old and he still sleeps with me.
Well, now you know almost everything about me.  :)

You can ask about my health and my several accidents in the local OAB, the
Brazilian Bar Association.  They usually call me "Highlander, the

About my pain...  Well, sorry for scaring you, but now I need to tell
something a bit embarrassing about me.
Already suffered several accidents and ruined some points of spine and back
having unusual habits and sex in non usual places.
Example: - Years ago, I broke my coccyx while having sex with my fiance in
the office stairs at night.  He was pretty excited, and while still fucking
me, threw me several stairs away, hahahaha!!!  It was f*cking painful, but
was so funny that I laugh until the hospital.  Obviously, the doctor asked
why I was almost naked and laugh more than me.
Already fell of several trees, bushes, stairs, walls, etc, and suffered
many accidents with skates, cars, robbers, stalkers, a lot of things...
Broke and/or had several injuries in both feets, both legs, arms, fingers,
spine, neck, head, some ribs, and so goes on...
Now, my spine will need the fourth surgery because the pain is becoming
unsupportive even for me.  Usually, I am considered pretty resistant to
pain for all my doctors.
And all these pains, muscles tension, lack of decent sleep, and stress are
causing strong migraines.  I do hate opioids and their disgusting effects,
but usual medication is not enough for controlling my physical pain in the
Sorry, I don't know to say it politely, but since yesterday, I am very busy
disgorging everything, even my internal organs and soul.  :P
So, being sincere, I am trying to rest a bit, because I had fever and
vomit, so I need to keep myself hydrated to avoid another physical
disaster.  And I am trying to discover what the hell happened with my
wi-fi.  I am using 4G for giving you some feedback.
Please, try to relax.  You are so stressed, boy.  Remember my cellphone is

It’s tempting to view QAnon’s rise as a threat to America’s democracy —
especially with a believer poised to win
 a seat in the House of Representatives. But history suggests that
conspiracy-based movements have been a part of the U.S. democracy since the
nation’s founding.
Long before the modern Republican and Democratic parties held sway, a
succession of others rose and fell. In between, smaller fringe movements
surged, often embracing some pretty bizarre conspiracies. Eventually,
though, the QAnons of the past didn’t take over mainstream parties. Rather,
their entry into the halls of power led to their absorption — or,
alternatively, excommunication — by more mainstream parties.
The historian Richard Hofstadter was one of the first to highlight the
significance of “paranoid” politics in a now-famous essay
 in 1964. Such conspiracies, he observed, invariably hold that a secretive
cabal of elite insiders intends to corrupt and destroy the nation. QAnon’s
satanic pedophiles working from within the “deep state” is squarely in this
Conspiratorial thinking first gained traction in U.S. politics in the late
1790s, when the New Englander Federalists, their power on the wane, became
convinced that Illuminati members headquartered in Europe were plotting to
destroy the new nation with their trademark secularism. A strange coalition
of Federalist politicians and congregational preachers joined together to
sound the alarm.

Some Federalist true believers argued that Thomas Jefferson, who would
challenge John Adams for the presidency, was the leader of the American
Illuminati and the embodiment of the antichrist.
Rev. Timothy Dwight, who was arguably the most prominent pastor associated
with the Federalists, led the call to arms in a famous sermon. “Shall we,
my brethren, become partakers of these sins?” he asked his congregation in
1798. “Shall we introduce them into our government, our schools, our
families? Shall our sons become the disciplines of Voltaire … or our
daughters the concubines of the Illuminati?”
This early movement, though, quickly faded out — as did the Federalist
Party. Indeed, Jefferson’s victory in 1800 ushered in the demise of the
Federalists over the next two decades. But conspiracy thinking hardly
In the 1820s, the U.S. was left with only a single major political party,
the Democratic Republicans. The fragile consensus unraveled over the course
of the decade, triggering a fresh wave of paranoia.
Back then, many members of the nation’s political elite belonged to the
Freemasons, a fraternal order that flourished in many countries. Membership
in this society came with a pledge of secrecy, and high-ranking Masons
earned titles like “master” and “high priest.” This was the “deep state”
circa 1826, complete with a star defector like Q: William Morgan.
The former Mason — and critic of the Masonic Order — was arrested and
promptly disappeared. Though no one ever found a body, the backlash against
Freemasons was ferocious. Before long, an entire political party had
emerged dedicated to exposing the iniquities of the secret order: the
Anti-Masonic Party.
As one historian of this movement has written
“Masonic secrecy became synonymous with darkness, sin, immorality,
intemperance, treason, and the work of Satan.” Or as one Anti-Mason
politician put it, Freemasonry lured people down “the steps that lead down
to the gates of hell; the paths of perdition; conclaves of corruption,
atheism, and infidelity.”

QAnon’s claims sound a lot like earlier conspiracy movements.

And yet, this did not lead to the end of the republic, then in its fourth
decade. Instead, the Anti-Masonic Party became institutionalized as a
political force, settling on key issues far removed from their original
obsession, like higher tariffs.
An Anti-Mason won the governorship of Vermont in 1831; in total, the
Anti-Masons sent 40 individuals to Congress, and many more to state
legislatures. It was then largely absorbed by the newly formed Whig Party,
which vied with the Democrats for dominance beginning in the 1830s.
By the 1840s, though, an even more elaborate set of conspiracy theories
would soon coalesce in response to the flood of Catholic immigrants. The
alleged papal plot to destroy America triggered even more tell-all
“memoirs” than the one about Masons.
These included bestselling books like “The Awful Disclosures of Maria
Monk,” purportedly written by a nun who had fled the convent. It painted a
sensationalized portrait rampant with sexual deviance, infanticide, and
secret and subversive plots. First published in 1836, it launched a flood
of similar exposes with titles like “Mysteries of Popery Unveiled.”
Some native-born Protestants, fearful of papist meddling, combined to
create a secretive society to counteract international Catholic influence.
The Order of the Star-Spangled Banner, as it was known, soon became a
formal political party dubbed the Know Nothings, a nod to the secretive
nature of its members.
Like the Anti-Masons, the Know Nothings arose at a moment of realignment of
the major political parties: The Whig Party was fading away. In fact, most
of the Know Nothings eventually joined a new political party by the middle
of the 1850s. They called themselves Republicans.
The Populist Party, founded in 1891, was a serious political organization
Though not primarily obsessed with conspiracies, some of its members
embraced, among other things, the belief that a cabal of international
bankers — typically Jews — manipulated events to suit their needs. The
Populists helped make works like “Seven Financial Conspiracies That Have
Enslaved the American People” a bestseller. While the party faded away,
many of its members would find a home in the increasingly progressive
Democratic Party.
In 1958, a candy magnate named Robert Welch founded the John Birch Society,
a group that anticipated much of the QAnon worldview.
For most people, the John Birch Society is vaguely associated with
anti-communism. In reality, though, Welch and his society offered a far
more expansive, all-encompassing vision
 of a worldwide conspiracy long before the arrival of the communists. In
his writings, Welch traced the roots of a collectivist conspiracy back to —
you guessed it — the Illuminati.
According to Welch, this all-powerful secret society created a shadowy
cabal he called the “INSIDERS” — usually denoted in capital letters — who
had been behind history’s watershed events, from the French Revolution to
the founding of the Soviet Union. According to Welch, communism was but a
“tool of the total conspiracy” that aimed to create an internationalist
“one-world government.”
Welch’s breathless account of this “satanic program” held that mainstream
politicians and military leaders were either unwitting dupes of this master
plan or ruthless agents of the underlying conspiracy. He would impugn
leaders like General George Marshall and Dwight Eisenhower, who Welch
considered “a dedicated, conscious agent of the Communist conspiracy.”
Nothing, he warned his followers, was as it seemed; appearances could be
Rank-and-file Republicans, many of them veterans of Senator Joseph
McCarthy’s crusade against a communist conspiracy, flocked to Welch’s
organization. Hundreds of chapters sprang up around the country. At its
peak, it numbered at least 100,000 members and operated 400 bookstores that
sold Welch’s manifesto, “The Blue Book,” as well as the society’s other
The Republicans had an uneasy relationship with the John Birch Society,
tolerating its antics but aware that doing so might tar the party as
extremists. It fell to the party’s chief intellectual, William F. Buckley,
to marginalize the Birchers. In the early 1960s, he wrote a series of
articles from his perch as editor of the National Review, attacking
 the group for disseminating “paranoid and unpatriotic drivel.”
The campaign succeeded, and the John Birch Society saw its influence wane.
But their excommunication was done in service of a larger rebranding of the
Republican Party, one that intensified after Barry Goldwater’s loss in a
landslide to Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. These efforts would ultimately
propel Richard Nixon, and later, Ronald Reagan, to the White House.
Forty years later, we are watching the demise of that incarnation of the
Republican Party and the rise of QAnon.
All the familiar ingredients are there: the fantasies that the world is
controlled by secretive groups of insiders who are agents of secularism and
Satan himself, and that they are sexually deviant and hellbent on the
nation’s destruction. Add to that QAnon’s embrace of nativism and
anti-Semitism, and you’ve got a banquet of conspiracy theories served up to
the credulous.
Can our political system tame this madness? If history is any guide,
there’s reason for optimism. But one thing to keep in mind is that this may
be the beginning of a very long haul.

Do not judge anyone so badly, please.  Markos is a really good person, but
English is not his first language and some of his ideas about the use of

Let me tell you a little tale about a very, very sweet guy named...  I
don't know, uh...  David.  Let's see...  I think he is French...  and is

Some time ago, I was telling him a little about my "best imaginary friend"
Mirimir and David's reaction was more adorable than Keanu Reeves playing
with puppies...  I had no time to explain him that Mirimir is a real
person, an Info Security guy using a fake persona for hiding his real data.
David thought I was feeling very sad having an "imaginary friend" as my
bestie and asked for being my Mirimir, a real Mirimir, giving me support
and making me smile in sad moments...  It was so unexpected and so sweet
that I cried for hours that night and I still cry when I tell this
story...  He was feeling hurt and fragile, but wanted to protect me from
sadness and loneliness...  :')
I do love my Mirimir, but I have other imaginary friends and also real
friends.  And now, I have my David!  <3
