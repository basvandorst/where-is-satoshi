You got those assumptions wrong, actually. But it isn't very intuitive to

If you're wondering if this makes Tor weak - not very, but partially yes.
Bruteforcing the full address is waaay harder (about 80 bits), but Tor will
still move forwards to making these addresses longer in the future with
stronger algorithms.

There's an endless number of ways that malware that don't follow any neat

the signs that well obscured malware will show will make it look like your

One problem is that the attacks change too fast. Holding off until they
change it themselves can allow you to detect even more of their activity
than anybody would if you told the world right away. Otherwise they'll
instantly stop the particular attacks you detected and switch to something
else. At best one could release details of how to analyze your old offline
