The 12th International Conference on Security, Privacy and Anonymity in
Computation, Communication and Storage (SpaCCS 2019)
July 14-July 17, 2019, Atlanta, USA
The 2019 International Conference on Security, Privacy and Anonymity in
Computation, Communication and Storage (SpaCCS 2019) is the 12th event in
the series of conferences which are devoted to security, privacy and
anonymity in computation, communication and storage. SpaCCS is now
recognized as the main regular event of the world that is covering many
dimensions including security algorithms and architectures, privacy-aware
policies, regulations and techniques, anonymous computation and
communication, encompassing fundamental theoretical approaches, practical
experimental projects, and commercial application systems for computation,
communication and storage. As applications of computer systems and networks
have permeated in every aspect of our daily life, the issues of security,
privacy, and anonymity have become increasingly critical. The conference
will provide a forum for the world-class researchers to gather and share
their research achievements, emerging ideas and trends in the highly
challenging research fields.
All accepted papers will be published by Springer LNCS (EI Indexed). Best
Paper Awards will be presented to high quality papers. Distinguished
papers, after further revisions, will be be published in 10+ SCI & EI
indexed prestigious journals (confirmed).

The 2019 International Conference on Security, Privacy and Anonymity in
Computation, Communication and Storage (SpaCCS 2019) is the 12th event in
the series of conferences which are devoted to security, privacy and
anonymity in computation, communication and storage. SpaCCS is now
recognized as the main regular event of the world that is covering many
dimensions including security algorithms and architectures, privacy-aware
policies, regulations and techniques, anonymous computation and
communication, encompassing fundamental theoretical approaches, practical
experimental projects, and commercial application systems for computation,
communication and storage. As applications of computer systems and networks
have permeated in every aspect of our daily life, the issues of security,
privacy, and anonymity have become increasingly critical. The conference
will provide a forum for the world-class researchers to gather and share
their research achievements, emerging ideas and trends in the highly
challenging research fields.

The 2019 International Conference on Security, Privacy and Anonymity in
Computation, Communication and Storage (SpaCCS 2019) is the 12th event in
the series of conferences which are devoted to security, privacy and
anonymity in computation, communication and storage. SpaCCS is now
recognized as the main regular event of the world that is covering many
dimensions including security algorithms and architectures, privacy-aware
policies, regulations and techniques, anonymous computation and
communication, encompassing fundamental theoretical approaches, practical
experimental projects, and commercial application systems for computation,
communication and storage. As applications of computer systems and networks
have permeated in every aspect of our daily life, the issues of security,
privacy, and anonymity have become increasingly critical. The conference
will provide a forum for the world-class researchers to gather and share
their research achievements, emerging ideas and trends in the highly
challenging research fields.

Computation, Communication and Storage (SpaCCS 2019) is the 12th event in
the series of conferences which are devoted to security, privacy and
anonymity in computation, communication and storage. SpaCCS is now
recognized as the main regular event of the world that is covering many
dimensions including security algorithms and architectures, privacy-aware
policies, regulations and techniques, anonymous computation and
communication, encompassing fundamental theoretical approaches, practical
experimental projects, and commercial application systems for computation,
communication and storage. As applications of computer systems and networks

Call For Papers
The 6th IEEE International Conference on Dependability in Sensor, Cloud,
and Big Data Systems and Applications (IEEE DependSys 2020)
14-16 December 2020, Fiji
DependSys 2020 conference is the 6th event in the series of conferences
which offers a timely venue for bringing together new ideas, techniques,
and solutions for dependability and its issues in sensor, cloud, and big
data systems and applications. As we are deep into the Information Age,
huge amounts of data are generated every day from sensors, individual
archives, social networks, Internet of Things, enterprises and Internet in
various scales and format which will pose a major challenge to the
dependability of our designed systems. As these systems often tend to
become inert, fragile, and vulnerable after a period of running.
Effectively improving the dependability of sensor, cloud, big data systems
and applications has become increasingly critical.
This conference provides a forum for individuals, academics, practitioners,
and organizations who are developing or procuring sophisticated computer
systems on whose dependability of services they need to place great
confidence. Future systems need to close the dependability gap in face of
challenges in different circumstances. The emphasis will be on differing
properties of such services, e.g., continuity, effective performance,
real-time responsiveness, ability to overcome data fault, corruption,
anomaly, ability to avoid catastrophic failures, prevention of deliberate
privacy intrusions, reliability, availability, sustainability,
adaptability, heterogeneity, security, safety, and so on.
All accepted papers will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press
(indexed by EI). Best Paper Awards will be presented to high quality
papers. Distinguished papers, after further revisions, will be be published
in 8+ SCI & EI indexed prestigious journals (confirmed).

Call For Papers
The 6th IEEE International Conference on Dependability in Sensor, Cloud,
and Big Data Systems and Applications (IEEE DependSys 2020), 14-16 December
2020, Fiji [Submission Deadline: Sep. 1][9+ Special Issues]
IEEE DependSys 2020 conference is the 6th event in the series of
conferences which offers a timely venue for bringing together new ideas,
techniques, and solutions for dependability and its issues in sensor,
cloud, and big data systems and applications. As we are deep into the
Information Age, huge amounts of data are generated every day from sensors,
individual archives, social networks, Internet of Things, enterprises and
Internet in various scales and format which will pose a major challenge to
the dependability of our designed systems. As these systems often tend to
become inert, fragile, and vulnerable after a period of running.
Effectively improving the dependability of sensor, cloud, big data systems
and applications has become increasingly critical.
This conference provides a forum for individuals, academics, practitioners,
and organizations who are developing or procuring sophisticated computer
systems on whose dependability of services they need to place great
confidence. Future systems need to close the dependability gap in face of
challenges in different circumstances. The emphasis will be on differing
properties of such services, e.g., continuity, effective performance,
real-time responsiveness, ability to overcome data fault, corruption,
anomaly, ability to avoid catastrophic failures, prevention of deliberate
privacy intrusions, reliability, availability, sustainability,
adaptability, heterogeneity, security, safety, and so on.
IEEE DependSys 2020 is sponsored by IEEE, IEEE Computer Society, and IEEE
Technical Committee on Scalable Computing (TCSC). All accepted papers will
be submitted to IEEE Xplore and Engineering Index (EI). Best Paper Awards
will be presented to high quality papers. Distinguished papers, after
further revisions, will be published in 9+ SCI & EI indexed prestigious
journals (confirmed).
