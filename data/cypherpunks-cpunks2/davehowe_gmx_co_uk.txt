@_subject: TrueCrypt, GostCrypt, *Crypt - status? 
I am expecting a future version to automate some of that - TC, great
as it is, really isn't good in the Enterprise because trying to manage
hundreds of volumes spread over hundreds of desktops, laptops, and
removable media, is a management nightmare. Competing (and presumably
less secure) products do well because they *do* cater to central
administration, and often integrate into a runtime AV, AT or DLP solution.
