Satoshi actually never, ever signed anything cryptographically.
We don't even know for sure if whitepaper Satoshi, genesis block Satoshi,
email address(es, there were two) Satoshi, and BitcoinTalk Satoshi were the
same person.

Tbf there are no (spendable) accounts which are known to be Satoshi for
There's the genesis block reward (not spendable due to a quirk in the
protocol), the address Satoshi used to send the first transaction to Hal
Finney (was this really Satoshi? We don't know for sure) and there are a
bunch of blocks that we strongly suspect were mined by Satoshi due to their
characteristics (mainly the incrementing nonce value).
Something signed with the genesis block reward address's private key would
be best proof... But still not perfect, since we don't really even know if
Satoshi was the same person over time, or if the same person operated all
the Satoshi email/forum accounts.
I don't believe this new pretender really is Satoshi  though (or,
hypothetically, any of the people who spoke as "Satoshi") because the
writing style is way off. Satoshi was never a mystic. Satoshi never spoke
in grand narratives either, just engineering pragmatism.

I'll be honest, I suspect that Satoshi was either Nick Szabo, Hal Finney,
or both working together. We'll never know for sure though.

I read about this too, it's not really a voluntary society in a libertarian
If you watch the vid, one guy works as a professor at a technical
university, and he gets nominated by his peers and elected to be one of the
12 "councilmen" or whatever they call it. It's notable that he doesn't have
a choice in the matter and has to quit his university job for 25% salary as
one of the councilmen.
If your neighbours decide you're standing for election, it doesn't seem you
have a choice. If they then elect you, you don't have a choice either.

Might be of interest to you.
This latest "Satoshi" is a hoax though, not very credible at all.

Hi to all in general and Jim in particular,
I don't check the list all that often at the moment, I decided to do a
keyword search after I saw your disqus comment. It's good to hear from you,
I'm a fan of Assassination Politics. It's a thought provoking work
describing a dangerous idea of the kind that has always fascinated me :)
I'll repeat what I said in my reply on the page:
Currently. Yes, the archive is basically just a clone of what's in the raw
files hosted on Ryan Lackey's venona site. I strongly, strongly suspect
that this has large amounts of missing data due to how quiet some periods
are, and also it ends in early 1999 anyway (with those emails tacked on to
the end of the 1998 archive).
I was provided with a (apparently) roughly complete archive for 2000 to
2016. This is hosted here currently:
I had strong ambitions of trying to index and merge all of the archives I
could get my hands on, but this is more challenging than you might think.
Determining which two emails are the same is very difficult when they
sometimes contain encoding errors, extra whitespace, differing text for
expressing the time of emails, etc (making hashing an infeasible way of
comparing them). I've also had an enormous amount of other commitments that
have preventing me working on this archive as much as I'd like (or at all
really, if I'm honest) over the past year.
The site is also a Jekyll-generated static site hosted on github. The sheer
number of pages is really approaching the limit of what's possible with
this approach. It takes over an hour to build the site currently. Adding
the 2000-2016 archive would be totally unworkable in this way. I also want
to index the messages in ElasticSearch or similar. The lack of a search
function is something that I feel is sorely lacking.
Sadly, for this reason, my attempts to synthesise all the available
incomplete archives of messages from this era have stalled :( it's there at
the back of my mind though, so I haven't lost the will to work on it, just
the time.
I hear your concerns about large numbers of missing emails, and if anyone
reading this has their own copies of the 1990s archives, I'd love to have
them. I can't make any promises about when I'll be able to work on
processing them, but rest assured I will take great care of those archive
files so that, should I fail to complete this task myself, those archives
will be collected together for someone else to attempt to finish the task.]
Whether or not those archives have willful deletions or modifications to
the data, I've no idea, to be honest. I would rely on others to notice and
report things that seem strange. Even then I'm not sure what to do about
it. When coming across two distinct versions of what appear to be the same
message, I'd probably just list both. That's all I can do really. This
project appears to be complex in a lot of ways that weren't obvious at the
start... which is a familiar story to anyone who sets out to solve a
problem I guess :)

Sorry, I only just saw this, messages addressed to me get filtered to a
label if they're also addressed to the mailing list. I should see if I can
change my filter to make an exception for this in my filter rule.
I've replied properly in another thread.

@_subject: No, Mr. Busby, there is a Santa Claus. 
I hear you.
We just need more people to come forward with their own archives of the 90s
so we can merge them. That's the most sensible solution (and the only one I
can think of).
Currently, the only game in town seems to be Ryan Lackey's archive. I'm
very keen to get hold of other archives of the period that other people may
have (and would be even in the absence of anything that suggests foul
play), so our goals are aligned here.

The count was performed by me programmatically. That count represents all
the emails associated with that email address that are present in the
venona raw archives.

It's not that I don't care, I just don't know what I can do about it. This
appears to be the only copy of the archive available.
If anyone else has a more complete archive, send it to me and I'll merge

@_subject: Missing video from Jeffrey Epstein's first suicide. 
I'm just a guy with a website. Believe me, it saddens me that so much is
lost, that's why I originally started trying to piece it all together, but
my leads ran cold, and if you go look at the commit logs for crypto
anarchy.wiki you'll see how little time I've had to work on it lately.
In terms of whether this is deliberate forgery or just lost data, I have no
way of finding out because I don't have other copies of the archive to
compare with. That's the only way to do it. And even then I can only detect
tampering, not innocent loss of data. I was under ten years old during this
period so I'm flying blind in terms of what it should look like.
I'm not a player in this drama, I'm just a guy who is mirroring what's
available so that isn't lost too.
I simply don't have the time to help you at the moment. I have too many
other commitments. I haven't even found time to merge the 1999-onwards
If you find a lead on any of it, let me know. As far as I can tell, Ryan
Lackey is the only one who can help you. This archive originates on Venona.
That I'm pretty sure about. If he won't respond to you, I don't know what
can be done. I really hope someone else finds an archive of this era,
because it's the most important era for sure.
But other than that, please bear in mind that I'm on your side. We both
have the same goal: a complete, accurate archive. I've done what I can so
far. I won't have time to work on this actively in the near future.

can i confirm that this is the Venona archive merged with the 2000-2016
archive from this post:
i.e. that we don't have a new, overlapping archive of the 90s period? I'm
assuming venona is still the only game in town for the 90s period.

Cheers for the response.
If any of you find anything new, if you emailed me directly, I'd be really
grateful (i.e. not to the list in case I miss it due to my filter).
