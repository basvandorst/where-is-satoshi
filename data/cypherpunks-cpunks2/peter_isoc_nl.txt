Old news.
Bitcoin was/is never anonymous, it was/is pseudonymous.
Tracking of Bitcoin was/is always possible unless countermeasures
were/are taken, like coinmixing. You can always use an AltCoin.

If memory serves me right, not only because some modems caused technical
issues with installed telephone infrastructure. But also because the
then customary flat rate for local telephone use meant that you could
get on the Internet almost indefinitely if an Internet access point was
within reach, f.i. university or library.
This extra and sustained load could cause technical issues in itself,
but it also cost the phone companies a pretty penny in lost income. No
wonder the phone companies were quick to change their tariffs to usage
