@_subject: Forward secrecy implemented, was Re: How to have your encrypted mail 
Forward secrecy is now working in Confidant Mail 0.28, and a new version with UI improvements will be posted in the next few days. You can rotate your encryption subkey and get rid of the old ones. Your key will not continuously grow in size. If you have a key on two machines, you do have to manually transfer it after a key rotation.

How does one go about getting on this list? I think Confidant Mail qualifies. It uses GPG end to end, and encrypts the metadata in transit.

My software goes through Tor hidden services (or exit node if necessary) and sets up a TLS session inside that.
The From address of the mail only exists inside the encrypted envelope, which only the recipient can open.
If someone had a global view of the Tor nodes, they might be able to track a particular message via timing, but going through Tor prevents mass surveillance by a passive observer.

@_subject: Confidant Mail, a new cryptographic mail system 
Confidant Mail is an open-source non-SMTP cryptographic email system optimized for large file attachments. It has its own client, server, and protocol. It uses GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) for content encryption and authentication, and TLS 1.2 with ephemeral keys for transport encryption.
It supports unlimited attachments (>4GB) and forwarding with signature intact. Kademlia or DNS is used for key lookup. TOR and I2P anonymity is optional. Servers operate in replicated pairs. You can use your existing email address and GPG key.
There is a Windows installer and automatic client configuration, so a Windows user can be online in under five minutes. Linux and MacOS users will have to install some prerequisites. The site has a test server pair online so you can try the system out.

@_subject: Encrypted mailing lists and anonymous collaboration 
Confidant Mail now has a beta encrypted mailing list feature. It works like
a normal mailing list in that you send a message to the listserv address and
the message is remailed to all the recipients. Unlike regular mailing lists,
access is controlled by public keys, so only a list of approved keys can
send to the list.
The messages are signed by the listserv's key, and by clicking Show Original
you can also check the signature of the original sender. Large file
attachments can be included in mailing list posts.
Confidant Mail can operate through Tor or I2P, so anonymous participants can
take part in a discussion without exposing their real-world identities.
In addition to the mailing list feature, I have added a file server. You can
send attachments to the file server, and they will be saved to a shared
directory. Other users can send get requests to retrieve the files. There is
an access control list, so specific public keys can be granted read-only,
write, or overwrite access.
Using the mailing list and file server, it is easy for a small group to
collaborate on a project while some or all of them remain anonymous. Even
the operator of the listserv can be anonymous behind Tor.
Please email me if you want to help test this out.

@_subject: How to have your encrypted mail in two places at once 
IMAP and webmail makes it easy to access your mail on two or more machines, and have all your folders stay in sync. Encryption tends to break that: your inbox might work across machines, but your Sent Items and personal folders tend to be stuck on one machine.
Confidant Mail 0.24 has a solution for that problem. You can have the same GPG key on two or more machines. Using a secure replication protocol, your sent items, read status of incoming mail, personal folders, and deletions are all automatically copied to the other machines. This provides an IMAP-like experience with encrypted mail.
I am looking for advice on how to implement a mobile client:
Option A is to re-create the current client functionality for the mobile platforms. That is a lot of work, and I am not experienced in mobile programming. There is a port of gpg to Android, but I don't know how good it is. I know zero about Apple.
This has disadvantages: for example, if I receive a 1GB message at home, there is no way for the phone to get only part of that message. It needs the whole message to check the signature.
The worst problem, however, is that you are carrying your private key around with you. Phones are not secure and cannot be made secure. The carrier has root on the phone, whether you do or not. Phones are easy to physically take, and do not have trustworthy encryption. I do not want my GPG key on my phone.
Option B is three-tier client server. Your PC at home has the private key, and talks to the Confidant Mail server. It also exposes a port which the phone accesses over a secure connection. The phone can request parts of messages, and the PC does the GPG encryption and decryption.
This has the advantage that the phone client is smaller, the big message problem is solved, and the exposed key problem is solved. The middleware on the PC could have constraints such as not allowing the whole mailbox to be downloaded, and logging itself out after some number of failed remote access attempts.
The downside is you need a PC running, you need to be smart enough to expose a port, and the PC is sitting there unattended, with the private key in memory, waiting for someone to come and grab it.
Option C is a mobile web client. Similar to B, but instead of a client-server protocol, it uses HTTPS and generates mobile friendly HTML.
Advantages relative to B are that one client supports all the mobile platforms, and there is no mobile code to write. Disadvantage is that the mobile browser is pretty easy to hack, and there is likely plaintext cached in the phone at any given time.
Anyone who needs strong security probably should not use a mobile device. However, many people will want access to Confidant Mail on their phones. Do you have an opinion on the right way to provide it?

@_subject: How to have your encrypted mail in two places at once 
That's a silly thing to say on a mailing list, lol. Obviously the medium is still useful.
SMTP, however, is an old and lame horse that ought to be turned into glue.
The best way to do that IMHO is make a new protocol, use them in parallel, and
wait until the old one becomes a big enough nuisance to go away. That is I am trying to do here.
Yes, data at rest is encrypted with things like DiskCryptor and cryptoloop. Data going over a wire is encrypted with TLS. A message addressed to a particular person (to whom you do not have a live connection) is best encrypted with something like GPG. You need all three for a secure messaging
Which adversarial progress are you referring to? GPG has proven itself robust over the years,
and Confidant Mail does not use SMTP.
If you mean forward secrecy, I'm working on that. In the meantime I'd still rather trust GPG than
some unknown protocol. If my private key gets stolen that's my own fault for being careless.

Why not just write it if you want it? You don't need a team of developers, because all the hard stuff (crypto) has been done.
I was thinking of using a blockchain to claim addresses. Confidant Mail currently has the problem that anyone can claim any email address, and the sender must check the recipient's key ID or signature to make sure he's talking to the right person. Why not use a blockchain like distributed commit protocol to resolve which key owns what address? The original owner would put out the first claim, and then the address belongs to him until he signs it over to someone else, just like bitcoins.

Why is GPG so reluctant to let you use ECC keys? Is it just a backward compatibility thing, or are they not trusted yet?
I have the code written to use GnuPG 2.x with Confidant Mail, and I am trying to decide whether to ship GPG 1.4.x or 2.x with the next Windows build. If I ship 2.x and people start using ECC keys, then 2.x is effectively mandatory from then on. What do you think?
