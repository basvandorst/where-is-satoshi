Either you are lying or you are misinformed, my red friend. Pic related.
The Free Speech Rally was Dr. Shiva "Poo-in-the-loo" Ayyadurai talking
about freedom of speech and the media.  You are basically cheering the
wrongful protesting of fellow cpunk, Steven Schear, since both lay claim
to "invention" many years after the act and seem to care about actual
If you don't believe me, take it from the Ministry of Truth.
**Until they shut it down.**

The pic I shared did not imply there was no protest; it showed a
thousand or so from the air.
You are supporting the protest of free speech.
And the violent actions to shut it down.
I understand you are an anarchist.
You still rely on a peer-to-peer whitelist process.
Otherwise you rely on a central authority.
Not so good for CAs, or even DAs, at times.
Yes it can but not something that requires more dimensions.  L/R implies
an unspecified center that is always moving.  Hard to derive consistent
value from that.
I thought all anarchists were Chaotic Neutral ?
Please explain your model.
Being used to undermine the social progress of the past 25 years. Read
into the facts, not the narrative.  I am sure you know the way.
You misspelled "falsified".
Here is a clip **No JS** that addresses your concern:
Start at 1:40.
No need to pretend, friend.  This is absolutely what happened.  The hip
progressives love irony.
Ever heard of Public Relations ?  This shit is just a giant skittles
commercial. Pic related.
People, even as smart as you, have been tricked.
Do you know what the Charlottesville Rally was about ?
Preserving a statue.
It was organized by Conservative Jews.
Not "Nazis".
Not "KKK".
Are the violent anti-speech protesters you seem to be defending.
"Neo-Nazis" hate authority.
"KKK" hates government.
Neither can be fascists.
Neither can be against speech.
Know who loves authority and hates speech ?
And you, seems.
