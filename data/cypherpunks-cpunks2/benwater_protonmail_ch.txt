@_subject: Paper on Assassination Markets 
Ever since I've read the Assassination Politics essay, my perspective of
the world has changed: at last, a tool to create an anarcho-capitalist
Alas, I've been dismayed by the lack of progress since it was first
published. Little interest, very few serious publications, and still no
running assassination market!
Since I'm not a developer I can't really create one, but I've written a
paper on assassination markets that I think could have some mainstream
appeal, by reconciling the AP idea with more palatable concepts such as
self defense and the NAP.
I'd love to have your feedback on this paper.
