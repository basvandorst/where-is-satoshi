"White", "Black", and "Brown" are labels intended to strip all people of
their ancestral heritage and cultural identity.
Don't use jew words to describe others it makes you a jew.
You mean Brits, since, even in the 18th century, "Anglos" were mostly
Irish and Scottish, as they are today.
How is this an insult ?
Europeans, just as Africans, Asians, and the mixed races, deserve their
own nations, otherwise you wipe the world of all its cultural
differences, causing a homogenization, or monocrop of sorts, and
everybody becomes the "same".
Ethnic marxism, tbh.
You are maybe thinking of Africans, who have an average IQ of ~80, which
is only a few points away from retarded. Maybe related to not having any
Neanderthal dna. Or maybe related to living in the abundance of North
Central Africa where resources are widely available, avoiding the
intellectual stress that those who lived where winter happens
encountered and responded to over millennia that created smarter and
more empathetic people.
The term, as applied to "nationalists", was created by a jew who thought
it was funny to apply the Bavarian colloquialism "Naczi" or "Nazi",
meaning backwards peasant, to their political opposition, the NSDAP.
Stop being a fucking jew.
Were Puritans (read: Purim) who thought they were irl isnotrealites and
viewed their emigration to the Americas as an actual "exodus". To them,
England was Egypt, the King was the Pharaoh, the Atlantic Ocean was the
Red Sea, America was the Land of isnotreal, and the Amerindians were the
ancient Canaanites, and they were entering into a new covenant with
"God" in a new "Promised Land".
Blame jews for perverting Celtic culture and forcing "Christcuckianity"
as they did with the Persian culture when they forced "Islame".
It was the jews you fucknut.
Specifically "Josephus".
I am Iranian.
Pic related is 100% Aryan waifu.
