John McAfee, with the help of MGT [0], is building a "truly private smartphone". Nigger added switches on the back to physically disconnect the battery, camera, and microphone, as well as the antennas for WiFi, Bluetooth, & geolocation. No speaker switch, tho.
With articles titled 'John McAfee’s ‘hack-proof’ phone is doomed to fail' it seems this fucker is headed down the correct path.
Some quotes from the lungenpresse:
Lol, these pozzed faggots can into journalism.
Hardware has everything to do with security, software has everything to do with insecurity.”"
