I do not employ the use of a "bong", or any tool to aid in the consumption of cannabis, as I do not consume cannabis.
However, 'The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross', by John Marco Allegro, is my reference. I am sure you have read this:
I know, right ?
Again, without the deets.
Foods establish the chemistry.
"Drugs" affect the chemistry.
Knowledge through experience. It seems you, and not jnn, need the dictionary. Maybe you meant (((expert))).
Is bad. So are wood-burning stoves.
Yes, ~80% plant matter.
Smells like bait !
However... I will bite ¢‿¢

The engines are tools.
The tools are not communities.
But the communities do depend on tools to exist.
What is the tool your community needs?
And what will your community need in a few years from now?

Lol, no.
Software is only as good as the code.
Code is only as good as the coder.
How many coders does it take to screw up a lightbulb ?
Just one.
People working on this shit studied at the (((best schools))), e.g., IIT, MIT, and so on, and only have one skillset: the ability to remember and follow orders.
The AI will only be as "intellegent" as the dumbfukcs working at Microsift and Toor.
