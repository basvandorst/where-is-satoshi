Generally I ignore your posts and stay out of your misdirected, hot air bleat-fests.  But I'm really tired of dealing with this type of self-aggrandizing, rude vitriol that detracts from an otherwise valid point, thereby alienating even your best allies.

It makes no damn sense to alienate the people most aligned with their cause and then spew racist language (as you do, as well), thereby harming any cause unfortunate enough to have itself associated with such behavior.
There is righteous anger tempered by wisdom, e.g. Dr Cornell West.  He doesn't mince words and he absolutely holds people accountable while understanding that allies come in all colors and from various walks of life.  Anger is valid: being intentionally racist and rude is not.

Jeezus, wtf!  Julian has either finally lost his mind from living in exile or someone has gotten to him.  What is this defeatist fuckery?!
Of course we learn to adapt while living under a surveillance, militaristic police state - while we use and make the tech that pushes back, and will ultimately take it back.
The very fact that the recent atrocities committed by crazy religious extremists and other mentally unstable people (including the latest delusional asswipe to shoot up a woman's health clinic in my gun-obsessed country) were able to be planned and carried out right under their noses proves that they're not ubiquitous.  They just like to project that image so we will self-censor and cower in fear, as Julian seems to be buying into.  Fuck That, I say!
Part of it is just practicality:  the Digital Stasi collects so much information that they can't process it all in a timely manner.  Since they claim to hoard all encrypted communications (as though they don't hoard everything anyway), using existing encryption and other strategies while we develop something better will keep these pissant spies busy for quite some I'm not a ter'rist, not doing anything particularly interesting or illegal, don't really have much I care to hide... and that's exactly why the fucking government is not allowed to read my email and track my every move.  They're proven that their attempt at constant and total surveillance is useless for keeping "the homeland" (what a fucking nazi phrase) safe, time and again.  They're the ones we need protection from anyway.
Adapt to survive: yes.  Always!  But advising that their cancerous surveillance is malignant, that it is too late to stop it, is utter bullshit.  I refuse.

No.  Just because my private thoughts may not be considered special or out of the ordinary does not mean you or anyone else has the right to know what they are unless I give you permission.

True, unfortunately.
Offense is often one of the best defenses.  Just one example: the data scraping and collating scum like Intellius and their ilk, from whose talons we cannot escape.  In such cases, it is better to pollute their data pool with garbage so it is of little value to them and we retain privacy by obfuscation. I've made sure that Intellius alone has three different profiles on me including varying ages, birthdates and backgrounds, and good luck to the marketing and profiling scum in discerning which - if any - is the real one.
I find absolutely no benefit in allowing Fuckerberg's empire of suck to acquire my data, so I prevent it in every way possible.  I don't use Google anything, but I know my emails get indexed and data-raped when I'm forced to correspond with people who use their "free" gmail.  There is no way to avoid every avenue of privacy violation, but it is possible to minimize it and not make it easy for the bastards.
Yes, and we know there is no closing the door after the data has gotten out so it is best to restrict and control access as best we can.
We're not doing a very good job, I fear.  But I live so much of my life online, (which is why I am fiercely protective of my right to control my PII when I see fit), I'm not going to acquiescence to zero-privacy as the norm just because "everyone else is doing it."  There are billions of people on this planet who believe in nonsensical things; it surely doesn't make them right.

It's deeply unsettling for me to admit that Dan correct about this, but there it is.
I don't use Failbook (as I'm sure you *all* know by now) and yet I have received disturbing email from the Fuckerberg empire encouraging me to sign up so that I may "connect" with "people I might know." This is because some of my friends who use it were not s-m-r-t enough to disallow the harvesting of their contacts.
One name that was suggested was someone I hadn't spoken with in well over a decade... there was simply no way they could have had my email address among their contacts, because that email address didn't exist during the time I knew them.  Failbook is omniscient!
There are several more instances in which my privacy was invaded or compromised due to the carelessness or ignorance of others, despite trying to maintain my nearly-zero online footprint online (in my legal name.  Of course I may be selectively found pseudonymously.)  That's not counting the countless Big Data database breaches which have put my medical and financial PII at risk.
The death of privacy is not going to be 1984'd; we already live within A Brave New World, and it's being built one narcissistic, geolocation-enabled, duck-faced selfie and status update check-in at a damn time.  Why would the TLAs waste any more* money on invasive data collection when people put their info and everyone else's out there, sold for the use of "free" email and apps?  Can't really blame them for plucking the lowest-hanging fruit.

It's what we have for the moment, though, and it's better than nothing.  Thecthulhu's 14-day key posting idea makes a lot of sense.  I'm interested in others' views as well.
Tbh, I'm wary of Cryptome admin these days.  When they recently tweeted out bullshit like 'Sabu's handler's number' to Jake then tried to backpedal as usual and say it was a joke, like all the other recent "jokes"... well, many of us are not amused.
Cryptome is, or was for a very long time, a respected repository of information.

No.  Just because my private thoughts may not be considered special or out of the ordinary does not mean you or anyone else has the right to know what they are unless I give you permission.
Which leads to:
People who grew up with the Internet... Do you mean the vapid idiots who willingly post every detail of their entire fucking lives on Failbook and fart out every insignificant, nonsensical thought in 140 character-blocks of uselessness?
We, the Old Farts who helped build the place, wish you'd clean your room and take better care of things, or we'll be changing the locks.

True, unfortunately.
Offense is often one of the best defenses.  Just one example: the data scraping and collating scum like Intellius and their ilk, from whose talons we cannot escape.  In such cases, it is better to pollute their data pool with garbage so it is of little value to them and we retain privacy by obfuscation. I've made sure that Intellius alone has three different profiles on me including varying ages, birthdates and backgrounds, and good luck to the marketing and profiling scum in discerning which - if any - is the real one.
I find absolutely no benefit in allowing Fuckerberg's empire of suck to acquire my data, so I prevent it in every way possible.  I don't use Google anything, but I know my emails get indexed and data-raped when I'm forced to correspond with people who use their "free" gmail.  There is no way to avoid every avenue of privacy violation, but it is possible to minimize it and not make it easy for the bastards.
Yes, and we know there is no closing the door after the data has gotten out so it is best to restrict and control access as best we can.
We're not doing a very good job, I fear.  But I live so much of my life online, (which is why I am fiercely protective of my right to control my PII when I see fit), I'm not going to acquiescence to zero-privacy as the norm just because "everyone else is doing it."  There are billions of people on this planet who believe in nonsensical things; it surely doesn't make them right.

It's deeply unsettling for me to admit that Dan correct about this, but there it is.
I don't use Failbook (as I'm sure you *all* know by now) and yet I have received disturbing email from the Fuckerberg empire encouraging me to sign up so that I may "connect" with "people I might know." This is because some of my friends who use it were not s-m-r-t enough to disallow the harvesting of their contacts.
One name that was suggested was someone I hadn't spoken with in well over a decade... there was simply no way they could have had my email address among their contacts, because that email address didn't exist during the time I knew them.  Failbook is omniscient!
There are several more instances in which my privacy was invaded or compromised due to the carelessness or ignorance of others, despite trying to maintain my nearly-zero online footprint online (in my legal name.  Of course I may be selectively found pseudonymously.)  That's not counting the countless Big Data database breaches which have put my medical and financial PII at risk.
The death of privacy is not going to be 1984'd; we already live within A Brave New World, and it's being built one narcissistic, geolocation-enabled, duck-faced selfie and status update check-in at a damn time.  Why would the TLAs waste any more* money on invasive data collection when people put their info and everyone else's out there, sold for the use of "free" email and apps?  Can't really blame them for plucking the lowest-hanging fruit.

Also agree with thecthulhu.  Cryptome's stance on mirroring has become arcane, and they like to dole out plenty of criticism but refuse to adopt basic security protocols.  Yeah, it's not perfect.  It's what we have for the moment, though, and it's better than nothing.  Thecthulhu's 14-day key posting idea makes a lot of sense.  I'm interested in others' views as well.
Tbh, I'm wary of Cryptome admin these days.  When they recently tweeted out bullshit like 'Sabu's handler's number' to Jake then tried to backpedal as usual and say it was a joke, like all the other recent "jokes"... well, many of us are not amused.
Cryptome is, or was for a very long time, a respected repository of information.  It'd be perfectly understandable if you're ready to hang it up, just please do it soon before you run it off the rails.  Please pass it along to others who are ready to take up the task and maintain what you have so painstakingly built.

I am plenty pissed off; have been taking action for a while now.  I take more steps than many people to try to block a lot of this data spying and siphoning (for which a few of even you have teased me!), yet I know it's never enough.
I have de-googled my phone as much as I possibly can.  I use no google products, have never used the google play store nor associated a google account with it (F-Droid & sideloading ftw) and use DDG or ixquick for search.
I use a good firewall and limit which apps can have root.  I use Ad Away and have modified my hosts file to block/loopback every analytics and tracking URL I can find, anything to do with google or Assbook (and many other popular sites that I personally do not use), all social media and sharing buttons, even gravatars.  I monitor logs to see what inter-app calls are being made.
I use FOSS, change app permissions and recompile .apks so they don't use permissions they don't need/shouldn't have.
Always blocking images in email is handy to stop web beacons.  I never click on links with a bunch of tracking info or when I can't see the exact I don't use social media of any kind.
I don't allow Flash (ever) nor JavaScript or cookies except when temporarily necessary on sites I trust (my credit union and email provider), use private browsing with Flash/plug-ins disabled by defult and clear everything upon exit.  Use HTTPS everywhere possible.  Block or spoof my browser string, don't allow referrers...and probably more things I'm forgetting.  Like proxies.
No, I do not notice any appreciable delays as I browse; most pages actually load faster without all that tracking crap.  Yes, it means I can't access some sites.  No, I don't care that my browsing experience looks more like 1995 than 2015.  I prefer it, actually (and I have no flashing .gifs or 'punch the monkey and win!' banners, but I do miss the dancing baby ;) )
While that is much, much more than the average person does (even amongst some cypherpunks I know), it's never enough.  My only alternative is probably ditching the damn phone, and I have considered it more than once.

TY for the summary.  I block all things goog but suspected this was the topic; agree with your comments.
Yes, because they have neglected the basic infrastructure for decades & discourage the use of individual solar/etc., some otherwise sensible people are welcoming the idea of these spy boxes - because their bullshit propaganda is designed to appeal to those of us who are concerned about the Oh sure, why would I mind if "the grid" reschedules my laundry to an "off-peak" time?  It'll save me money (*always* the hook, if the environmental concern-troll act fails), and I'm not home anyway, right?
Oh wait, they know when I'm not home...
they also know:
 when I wake up,
 which appliances I use and when,
 whether I have had an overnight guest,
 when I leave and for how long I am gone, (which they can combine with transit pass records- which some employers have integrated with electronic, RFID-polluted work IDs so there is almost no avoiding it unless you take active measures to do so, which then invites further spook scrutiny),
 credit card purchases and surveillance cam info (interconnected by TrapWire [0] to know where I've been & what I've been doing all day, so even if you leave your universal tracking device at home, walk/bike everywhere and pay with cash/BTC, you are still tracked-as-fuck),
 when I get home,
 what I read or watch and listen to,
 when I go to sleep, and with whom ...
If your municipality hasn't yet deployed these spy boxes, do what you can to slow their roll out!  Is this what you want (in addition to the very real detrimental health effects already mentioned?)
I live in one of the most liberal, progressive cities around and initially they'd treated us as some conspiracy theorists when a few of us raised concerns about the unnecessary collection of data, the security of the transmission of said data & who will have access to it and the health concerns.  Now they've been scheduling dog & pony show community meetings to "address our concerns," and attending one probably puts you on the same list as going to a 2600 meeting...
They are supposed to begin the deployment of these spy boxes here in 2016-17 and I'll be damned if they'll put one on my abode.  For being such an inconvenient troublemaker, they'll charge $50 or more per billing cycle (final amount is as yet undecided.)
This is total bullshit.  They can upgrade "the grid" without making it a universal spying network, but why would they when sheeple don't complain and push back?

Yes, because they have neglected the basic infrastructure for decades & discourage the use of individual solar/etc., some otherwise sensible people are welcoming the idea of these spy boxes - because their bullshit propaganda is designed to appeal to those of us who are concerned about the Oh sure, why would I mind if "the grid" reschedules my laundry to an "off-peak" time?

 credit card purchases and surveillance cam info (interconnected by TrapWire [0] to know where I've been & what I've been doing all day, so even if you leave your universal tracking device at home, walk/bike everywhere and pay with cash/BTC, you are still tracked-as-fuck),

If your municipality hasn't yet deployed these spy boxes, do what you can to slow their roll out!  Is this what you want (in addition to the very real detrimental health effects already mentioned?)
I live in one of the most liberal, progressive cities around and initially they'd treated us as some conspiracy theorists when a few of us raised concerns about the unnecessary collection of data, the security of the transmission of said data & who will have access to it and the health concerns.  Now they've been scheduling dog & pony show community meetings to "address our concerns," and attending one probably puts you on the same list as going to a 2600 meeting...
They are supposed to begin the deployment of these spy boxes here in 2016-17 and I'll be damned if they'll put one on my abode.  For being such an inconvenient troublemaker, they'll charge $50 or more per billing cycle (final amount is as yet undecided.)
This is total bullshit.  They can upgrade "the grid" without making it a universal spying network, but why would they when sheeple don't complain and push back?

You're on "lists" no matter what you do, or do not do.  I'm not on Facebook or any other social media- that's definitely a list-able offense ;)  Just ignore them and use the regular, common sense precautions that should be part of your daily routine anyway.

The larger points, which occurred after I'd already hit 'send':  where did they get this 'cache'?  (Snowden insists he released what he had to Greenwald/Poitras et al in HK, and until proven otherwise I choose to believe him.)  Sure, I guess he could have been blackmailed / rubberhosed...

I'll preface this by saying that I'm not fond of censoring list topics; I just skim or ignore topics/posts when they cease to interest me.
I think discussing politics and propaganda is on-topic when it regards the main focus of the list.  When governments intentionally weaken encryption, or threaten to/ actually pass draconian laws that directly affects the work we endeavour to do.  Censorship, even, because we need to help reroute people around those blocks to get their messages out and essential info in.
The pointless droning on about how much the USA and what it does sucks- and it does suck!- can become old.  I know it's tempting because there are a lot of people here who agree, but there are other listservs better suited for it.
Not meant to be a personal attack on anyone; I don't have a problem with any of you & I find it easy to scroll past that which doesn't interest me.  Sometimes I'll even see a point of view I hadn't considered, even if the item in question isn't quite on-topic. Not everyone feels the same, though.

I've been following this since it was posted.  Speaking as someone who doesn't trust anyone in the employ of the US of Corporatocracy: while it piques my interest enough to suspend my disbelief a little to see where it is headed, you lost me me with that last paragraph.
Without something to back it up, I just can't buy that we're living in a 1984/Truman Show construct.  I know I'm not the only one on these lists who enjoys the dark utopia and Cyberpunk genres of fiction, so if you're testing out ideas you'll find plenty of eager readers.  But call it that, ffs.
No links to source, nothing but fantastic (albeit interesting) descriptions... throw us a bone, sir, or I must call BS.

Or perhaps one of the many data breaches of the incompetent fed.gov contained info, legally held or otherwise, on other five eyes operatives and this is an opportunistic parallel construction to try to implicate and nab Snowden?
Seems like they'd want to keep something like this quiet if their operatives really were in danger.  Jmo.

That would explain a lot.  Perhaps my memory is being selective (or I'm becoming an even crankier curmudgeon), but it seems to be a far cry from what it was when it began.  Maybe it has always sucked but we had fewer choices with which to compare?

You do raise a valid point (and I enjoy "explain it like I'm five!")  It's an angle I hadn't considered; I should wait to reply until I'm not in the throes of insomnia ;)
The larger points, which occurred after I'd already hit 'send':  where did they get this 'cache'?  (Snowden insists he released what he had to Greenwald/Poitras et al in HK, and until proven otherwise I choose to believe him.)  Sure, I guess he could have been blackmailed / rubberhosed...
And the TLAs whine loudly about being thwarted by encryption, when they themselves have weakened EC anyway, and Russia/China have decrypted it but not the US?!  Why would they even admit to that...
I can't put my finger on it, and I'll readily admit I'm biased in that I don't trust the five eyes or their propaganda at all, but there is just something "off" about this whole thing.

Wow, this is exactly the kind of bullshit- and bullshit response- I'd expect from this duplicitous NSA asset.
I keep a seldom-used, older version of chromium on one of my debian laptops so I'll check for this.  My webcam and microphone are physically disconnected anyway, but I still want to see if their spyware has infected my system.  Fuckers.

I'll preface this by saying that I'm not fond of censoring list topics; I just skim or ignore topics/posts when they cease to interest me.
I think discussing politics and propaganda is on-topic when it regards the main focus of the list.  When governments intentionally weaken encryption, or threaten to/ actually pass draconian laws that directly affects the work we endeavour to do.  Censorship, even, because we need to help reroute people around those blocks to get their messages out and essential info in.
The pointless droning on about how much the USA and what it does sucks- and it does suck!- can become old.  I know it's tempting because there are a lot of people here who agree, but there are other listservs better suited for it.
Not meant to be a personal attack on anyone; I don't have a problem with any of you & I find it easy to scroll past that which doesn't interest me.  Sometimes I'll even see a point of view I hadn't considered, even if the item in question isn't quite on-topic. Not everyone feels the same, though.

The Wall of Sheep would like to announce a call for presentations at DEF
CON 23 at the Paris and Bally's Hotels in Las Vegas, NV from Friday, August
7th to Sunday, August 9th. The Wall of Sheep will be delivering talks that
increase security awareness and provide skills that can be immediately
applied after the conference. Our audience ranges from those who are new to
security to the most seasoned practitioners in the security industry.
Introductory talks are welcome.
Topics of interest include:
* Tools on network sniffing, intrusion detection and monitoring, forensics
* Tools for data collection (e.g., Yara, Cuckoo Sandbox)
* Python or Ruby programming for security practitioners
* Hardening the enterprise using open source tools
* Getting multi-vendor tools working together
* Tool/task automation and optimization
* Incident response process and procedures
This year, all accepted talks will be announced, recorded, and published by
DEF CON Communications, Inc (yes, by the conference).
The Wall of Sheep will not accept product or vendor related pitches. If
your talk is a thinly-veiled advertisement for a product or service your
company is offering, please do not apply!

Wanted to add: when collecting oral fluids for HIV tests, we use a buccal swab which needs to be in contact with the oral mucosa for a few seconds in order to absorb a sample good enough to perform an accurate ELISA.  So I too doubt the viability/usability of a saliva sample on an old stamp.

[Random snipping ahead to reply inline while on my mobile, apologies]
[Georgi]> btw, does rowhammer escape VM? (appears to me yes).
I think it does, but I've not done enough testing on my own to be sure.
Yep, agreed.  I meant that I also use VM on my crappy airgapped box, even though it doesn't matter as much as my other boxes of importance or networked laptops etc. VM should be pretty standard security fare, and yet nothing is 100% secure.  We do what we can, adding layers so that it may slow down any threats.  There is no way to be absolutely secure, it's a sad fact of modern life. But we don't have to make it easy for the bastards, you know?
Automated TiBU + weekly manual backups of media to external drive?  That's what I do; couldn't pay me to use a cloud backup.  Same as with people complaining about the first Blackphone not having access to GAPPs/ Google Play (...seriously?), do u even sideload bro?  Do it regularly when you're managing your other data backups, it's quick and painless after the initial I'm surprised to hear that come from you.  I've never used a cloud backup and the most I've ever lost is a day or two's worth of data/ media.  I have redundant backups.  It's not difficult (it truly isn't, I'm not trying to be snotty.)
Do you mean the same lusers who broadcast the fact that they're on vacation all over Failbook, post photos with GPS enabled and are then surprised when their home is burglarized?
Sadly, it's not a "thing" anywhere right now.  Not when EC has been intentionally weakened, etc.  Hell, even if crApple did have true full disc encryption, I wouldn't use their closed source crapware.
"Essential" is very much a subjective term.  I don't mind most of my web browsing experience looking like plaintext (in fact, I much prefer it.)  However, I understand most people do not want to use the web in that way.  We all make concessions we consider acceptable, sacrificing privacy/security for convenience.  I'm guilty of it, too.  Anyone with a smartphone and a credit/debit card is as well.

I respect you immensely, and I know you've told us multiple times not to trust anyone - including you.  I'd like to hear your side.  This potentially affects me, as I've been visiting Cryptome during the time period in question (and long before.)
I'm just now going to look at the data.  Anxiously awaiting your input, JY.

@_subject: The GCHQ Cryptome slide could be a mockup/disinfo 
Wow, what the hell is going on here?!
I'm replying to all of the posts made thus far on this topic; I'm sorry, but I don't have the time nor inclination to respond to them individually.
So John finally replies, but feels the need to call this guy an asshole.  Why is that?  I don't know him, but going solely by his site and contributions to archive.org, he is a legitimate researcher.  He tried going through the usual steps before disclosure, just like the rest of us do.  Only brought it to the public for verification and analysis after the source refused to cooperate: just like the rest of us.  Problem?
There are no sacred cows.  There is only data, and whatever truth is borne out of it whether or not it's the answer we wish to see.  The scientific method and all, you know, that most of us hold dear.
Georgi, he didn't outright say Snowden was a liar.  He was calling into question the validity of a slide that Snowden may not have even seen, or may not have scrutinized.
Also, the journalists releasing the data have an open history of working with the feds before releasing info - how do we know they wouldn't possibly alter data under pressure?  A decade ago, no less than the venerable NYT sat on the warrantless wiretapping story for over a year!  They caved when Risen's book was about to be published.  That does not exactly inspire But what if this (or any other claim, backed with evidence) *did* call into question the rest of the data attributed to the Snowden dumps?  Isn't the truth more important than holding up false ideals?  Religion and politics have the lock on that brand of cognitive dissonance, they don't need our help.
Snowden is not infallible.
Cryptome/JY are not infallible.
Hell, even Ellsberg isn't infallible (as we were recently reminded.)
Best is not infallible, but I haven't seen him claim to be so.  Don't judge the messenger; look at the data and draw your own conclusions, the way we do with everything else.
This isn't a false controversy, Travis.  And some of us do care.

@_subject: The GCHQ Cryptome slide could be a mockup/disinfo 
You're right about the privacy aspect, but still missing the entire point.
I don't care about showing up in server logs, although my personal security practices are much different now than they were six years ago.  I may have spotted my own information in the data, and I might be able to prove it (the Palm Pre is in a box 'o bits & crap somewhere.)
The bigger picture is not why Cryptome appears to be distributing old log files, but validity of the GHCQ slide in question.  That's why all the data is being put up for scrutiny, and we are losing sight of the importance of it with all the noise.
Doesn't matter if JY is a fed asset.  Doesn't matter if Best is a troll with a personal vendetta against JY/Cryptome (neither of which I believe to be true, but still.)
A slide was presented as being part of the Snowden dump.  A researcher has shown that with these log files, anyone could have made this slide.  This is a Big Fucking Deal with possibly numerous implications about a much larger dataset.
Forget about who is saying what and just look at the data and draw your own conclusions.  We are better than this.

Have you read about this from the beginning?  If so, you'd know that Mike Best is not the one claiming that the GCHQ slide is real.  He is trying to establish whether nearly anyone could have made the slide with the logs Cryptome leaked/distributed/whatever, unwittingly or otherwise.  That's all, and I don't know how a researcher trying to verify data has become a giant shitstorm.

When the logs have been distributed by Cryptome via USB and torrents as part of the archive for over a year?  Yeah, it's fair game.
Note that he removed those files once JY finally gave an explanation.

He did post a redacted version.  Then JYA accused him of everything from faking the data to being a spy.
When we post about vulns on FD/ wherever, we follow the process of notifying and following up before posting publicly - which we only do when devs or corps refuse to acknowledge or outright deny.  Right?  That's exactly how he went about it, and then was attacked in a most nonsensical manner (we didn't even get a notorious JYA poetic diatribe!)
In addition, as previously mentioned, these datasets have been in the wild for > 1yr.  As someone who may have found my own data in the access logs, I still say he did the right thing.

@_subject: Why cryptome sold web logs to their paying customers? 
The Cryptome archives *are* publicly accessible.  John limits bots and leechers to a certain number of files per day (as is his right, he is paying for the bandwidth), approx 100 iirc, but anyone who can use search strings can find anything on the site.
In the past, John has given his blessing to uploading the Cryptome archives to the torrents.  The files number close to 100K: I would not expect someone to inspect each document and folder of a public archive before uploading it, but Mike Best took the extra step to contact JY when he saw the log files and asked if those were part of the public archive or if they'd been included by mistake.  If it had been resolved at that time, the log files would not have been published and we would not be having this particular discussion.
We can see from the hash on coderman's torrent from 2014 that those same log files were indeed included on the USB drives sent out by Cryptome and in the archives John uploaded a few months ago for us to seed on torrents.  (Which, incidentally, I'd planned on seeding as well, until my seeder box bit the dust and I have yet to replace it. I can tell you I would *not* have parsed 98,000 files before seeding the torrent.)
I haven't yet stated my personal opinion on this because I have wanted this to be about the slide in question.  I've been taken aback by the attacks on the researcher and I am worried that it's going to scare off the next person with important info to share.  That's a lose/lose situation.
There is no clear answer here.  Yes, we are all responsible for our own opsec.  Absolutely. If we access the clearnet without encryption we are leaving digital DNA everywhere and we get to face the consequences.  This incident is a good reminder of this fact.
Should access logs be kept for that long?  Absolutely not.  From what I have read in the email exchange that was posted, the log files were included in a NetSol total restore.  My guess is that John/Cryptome did not intentionally keep these files, and did not realize these files were included in the archive.  When I do incremental backups or updates on my own systems, I don't usually go back and check the integrity of files I've already archived in my closed system.  I can see where this could be an honest mistake that has gotten blown way out of proportion.  It's a good lesson to be more aware of these types of glitches.
Can we collectively agree that it's not an ideal situation, but that we are all human and, as such, make mistakes - and just move on to the real issue of the veracity/provenance of the slide attributed to the GCHQ, which purportedly shows the (illegal) interception of the data of Cryptome visitors?
That's the real issue here, and it *does* matter.  I implore us all to let the noise die down and get to the matter at hand.
Yes, with UKUSA / five eyes, GCHQ likely gets access to this type of data from the NSA just for the asking.  That, too, is not the point in this

You don't take the permission to upload the same information JY allowed to be uploaded to public torrents as implied permission to post the *same* files on archive.org?
Also, before Best posted anything at all, he contacted John.  Twice.  JY could have expressed his disapproval at that time.  We know about it because Best posted it to the list: how many other mirrors are there?  Will you find them, check them all for the log files in question and chastise those posters as well?
Cryptome has never endorsed the authenticity of any specific mirrors, but has never discouraged the mirroring of the archives (at least not to my knowledge, and I've been around for a while.)
As I've stated, I'm fairly certain my info is in the dataset and it's on me for not employing better personal browsing security.  I'm not angry with any of the parties involved; sunlight is the best disinfectant, and this discussion can become a positive thing if serves to remind us that despite best intentions, someone, somewhere, is always watching and it is up to us to protect ourselves.

Not Google specifically, but here is one example of the highly invasive tracking of much, much more than web logs:
"Verizon is giving a new mission to its controversial identifier that tracks users that tracks users of mobile devices.  Verizon said in a little noticed announcement that it will
soon begin sharing the profiles with AOL's ad network, which in turn monitors users across a large swath of the Internet.
That means AOL's ad network will be able to match millions of Internet users to their real-world details gathered by Verizon, including  "your gender, age range and interests." AOL's network is on 40 percent of websites, including on ProPublica.  AOL will also be able to use data from Verizon's identifier to track the apps that mobile users open, what sites they visit, and for how long. Verizon purchased AOL earlier this year."

Michael Best bbrewer has made a good point, actually.  If someone is served a NSL, they are gagged - prohibited by law from saying anything about it.  Look at Nick from Calyx: after a decade, his gag order has finally been lifted but there is still a 90-day period during which the gag remains intact to give the feds time to appeal.  It's crazy stuff.
Even if JY did it to "make a point" about all security being illusory BS, the log files dropped are old enough that they probably wouldn't cause much harm.  The same basic argument used by Wikileaks when they dropped the State Dept cables.

COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
I, John Young, administrator of Cryptome, hereby declare that logs of Cryptome are deleted daily, or more often during heavy traffic, to protect the privacy of visitors to the site. Cryptome does not own or know the location of the machine which hosts its virtual private server under a service agreement with NTT Verio. There are several international mirrors of the files on Cryptome, all of which, to the best of my knowledge, delete logs to protect privacy of visitors.

 John Young So, its been a day since this was posted.  It appears as though neither JYA nor Cryptome have been compromised and the posts and tweets that have followed appear to be authentic JY.
I've been a bit busy today, so - have I missed it?  John's explanation of why he would keep access logs going back to 1996, when it was posted on Cryptome itself for years that logs were deleted daily or better - and he gave an affidavit to a grand jury stating that he had no such files?  Or perhaps why he wants to sell out in the first place?
If he's tired of doing it, I get it.  If he wants to enjoy his remaining time on the planet instead of dealing with this BS, more power to him.  But why go out this way?  The legacy he has built with that site is being crushed.  Without Cryptome, there would likely be no Wikileaks.  No Manning, no Snowden.
This isn't just about being identified in the logs, but their very existence.  Those of you who insist on trying to divert the conversation away by blaming people for not being behind 7 proxies are just wasting space.  We know, we preach it too!  That is not the point.
Personally, I don't give a fck if my info is in the log files.  If I did, I surely would not be posting to public lists about it.  I'm probably on enough "watch lists" already that visiting Cryptome isn't going to make a damn bit of difference.
No, I'm concerned for sources that gave info and documents to Cryptome.  For people in countries where they possibly face dire consequences for even viewing such info (jail, torture, even death.)
It's not funny, and it's not right.  From what I've heard, a bunch of us would really appreciate an explanation from John - in plain English.

Very well said!
There are situations where crypto is required.  We should do everything we can to help people learn to use it, especially to facilitate their communications when secrecy is absolutely necessary.
Yes, it's sometimes fun to encrypt fuck-off messages to the spooks inside lolcats.  But I've reached a point where I'm tiring of the cat-and-mouse game 24/7.  Encrypting *everything* frustrates them, but to me it also signals that we expect they are monitoring everything without cause or suspicion (in violation of the 4th amendment and many other laws of sovereign nations, worldwide) and we are giving them tacit permission to continue to do so.
Those who understand encryption and can use it correctly are still a relatively small minority.  I feel like "encrypting everything" just because *I* can, while the majority of the planet has never even heard of Whit Diffie or elliptical curve, sort of defeats the purpose.
We can protect ourselves (and in some cases, at this point in time, encryption is mandatory to our personal safety - but should not be used as false security), but dismantling the surveillance machine that captures everyone's emails to grandma, catalogues every single purchase and aids in the perversion of justice (via parallel construction, etc) seems to me to be the nobler goal.

That's what Mike did.  Because there is a larger question of whether they could have been used to forge a slide, it became a more complex matter.  When John ignored him and then attacked him and accused him of faking the data, he came here.  At that point, what else could he really do?
John says the log files have now been removed from the archive.  If Mike had remained quiet, as you seem to be suggesting, they'd still be in there.

Looking at it the other way: which set might include people like coderman, Jim Bell, Brian Carroll... mk @ desu = liberté.  Nadim K?
If this is someone else's list, it makes no sense to me that coderman would be on it (if it were indeed a list of "crackpots and cranks.")  He files a lot of FOIA requests, and that probably irks a fair number of people with an interest in keeping the info hidden.
Jim: he needs no further explanation.  A glorious thorn in the side of a bunch of people would couldn't deserve it more.
And, so on...
It could be some kind of tactic to attempt to squelch voices of dissent/advocates of crypto, sure.  They've been doing such things long before Snowden found out about it.

[Snipping as needed.  Warning: it is lengthy.]
I facepalmed so hard when I read this.  I support and agree with both Razer's and Juan's replies to this post; I just didn't want to offend the netiquette-sensitive by posting +1 to both replies.
All of these:
Totally miss the point.  Totally.
You seem to be speaking from a position where it sounds like money is the focal point, the most important factor.  To me, it is the least important part of the equation.
Ever heard of voluntary simplicity?  It's a concept I have embraced for all of my adult life.  I don't have much money because I don't want it.  I don't use many resources because I like to tread lightly upon the earth, and I don't think it's fair if I have an abundance of something while others have none.  I'm not a capitalist, never have been nor will I ever be.  I agree with Razor's view of capitalism.  Juan's, too.
Nor do I have a god delusion that lets me shit all over the earth, be horrible to people and do whatever else I want as long as I say the magic words in a prayer and put an offering of filthy lucre in a basket for absolution.   This is the only shot I get at not being a totally useless garbage person.  My conscience won't allow me to mindlessly consume at the expense of the planet and other people.  I'm not sorry for that.
One aspect of the human cost of "shiny new crap" has already been pointed out by Razer.  I wasn't talking about the monetary cost to you (although paying €200/mo for a phone and laptop is incredibly unnecessary, imho.  But I like to have control over the operating systems of my devices, and see no reason to upgrade hardware to newer models if they're in good working order and meeting my needs.)
Do you get no sense of personal satisfaction from repairing something that would have gone into a landfill?  Or of building something exactly how you want it instead of buying overpriced, pressed particleboard crap that is toxic to both humans and the environment?  Where is your hacker ethic, man?
More appropriate is the question, what wouldn't you trade?  Things you no longer use or need for something you do.  Skills you have, for some your neighbor has (can be as simple as I'll help you repair and paint your porch, you help me sow and plant my garden.)  Trading child/ elder/ pet care, shared meals, errands... do you really have no friends or neighbors with whom you do this?
The list of what one wouldn't buy secondhand is much shorter. Yes, you can go into the Gap and buy a pair of pants for €70... but why would you want to?  So what if it takes me an hour to look through thrift store racks - for that $70, I'd come out with several pairs of perfectly nice pants, skirts, shirts... it's madness.
 I have a dresser for which I paid $20 at a thrift store, over 20 years ago.  It is made of sturdy, solid wood and in excellent condition, has survived cross-country trips and countless local moves.  Good luck with your Walmart junk!
That hour I "wasted" saving hundreds of $ or € in a thrift store?  I'll get it back by using commute time to read and catch up on things while taking the bus or train.  You'd be stuck driving in traffic (if you lived in my city; not sure how it is where you live), all stressed out.
What I don't buy used: undergarments, pillows, etc.  But I won't ever buy them at Walmart, either.
No. That's why I said *true* fair trade, a living fucking wage.  Not a bag of coffee from a corporate behemoth with a fake stamp on it.  Please, tell me you knew that and are just being cheeky?
So are you saying that you're okay with people working in slave labor conditions & being paid subhuman wages, polluting the atmosphere by transporting this stuff for thousands of miles... instead of supporting the local businesses in your own community, if the price is right?  I can't even answer this.  Not without flaming.  I can't.
I don't intrinsically hate cars.  As was already mentioned, does everyone really need one (or more) of them, though?  Your CBA is flawed because, again, you're only thinking of yourself.  Your convenience, your money.  There is an entire world around you.  You could start by cutting back on the amount of damage you do to it.
Public transport sucks sometimes, no doubt.  Get involved to make it better.  It's not wasted time if you use it to read, learn something new, chat with someone, or post random bullshit to public internet lists ;)
On nice days, biking is good exercise for those who are able.  Most of us don't get enough exercise as it is.
It is not ANY of these things.  Use that time on the bus to learn how to cook basic stuff!  Cook on the weekend while hanging out with friends/family or rocking out to music and make your lunches and dinner main dishes for the entire next week.  How is that not saving time, money and being good for your health?
It is, and much better for your health as well (not to mention, better for the animals!)
If the meat industry wasn't subsidized, you'd be paying $20/lb for hamburger.  If you're truly interested, read Diet for a New America by John Robbins (who was heir to The Baskin-Robbins ice cream fortune and walked away from it all to lead a vegan, ethical life.)
It has America in the title but is applicable to all (we are just among the worst offenders, as with most things.)  There are several documentaries that show the horrors of factory farming; I'll list some if you'd like.  Not only is it barbaric, it is extremely unhealthy for you.
Razer and Juan answered the rest of this with much more grace than I would.  Wouldnt want my "fuck" counter to push me higher on the offensiveness list ;)

Sane...yes.  Well that explains the Wall St vultures, then!
Right, and I do understand that.  While I truly wish we lived in a world where could trade and barter for everything, the ISP and utility companies want actual payment for services ;)
As was mentioned, nothing is pure or perfect.  Doing the best we can, which will be different for everyone, is the goal.  Some people really need to have a car.  I don't, so I do not.
A friend and I do our grocery shopping together.  He has a car because of work;  I very often take care of his cat.   I'm not going to pretend that I can walk or bike home with an armload of groceries and 13 kg of cat litter, lol.  We get to catch up and the chore of shopping goes by quickly.
Right on, Zenaan!  (Sounds like we're about the same age, too.)  It's been about as long since I watched tv on a regular basis as well.  For my few indulgences, like The Walking Dead (yep, vegan pacifist likes zombie apocalypse. Hannibal, too!  Save the animals, Eat the Rude :D ), I go watch with friends.  More fun that way anyway.
I, um, may have downloaded Mr Robot.  Shhh.
There are several hacker spaces and maker spaces in my city, and many informal gatherings.  I'm very fortunate :)
Well, yes.  Being mindful isn't always easy, but does lead to a more fulfilling existence.  It's more of... just trying to be a decent human, as I see it?  We're all stuck on this rock spinning in space. We may as well be decent to each other, things seem to be better that way.
What other rational choice is there?  Arbitrary boundaries of countries are drawn and redrawn like a game of Risk played in a dorm room, and with far less care; they mean nothing, in the humanistic sense.  We're all in the same damn boat.  We sink or swim, together.
Note: boundaries of other countries never seem to matter to the jerks who run mine, for a much different reason.  I am sorry, world.  More than I can So, yes.  I feel that all of our choices have a global impact, one way or another.  I try to tip the scales in favor of the greater good, when I can.
Well, fuck.  Ya got me :p

You're absolutely right.  We USians (or Americunts, as Juan says, which always makes me laugh in agreement), only have propaganda "textbooks" in school.  It's not unless/until we are fortunate enough to stumble upon Howard Zinn's books or develop critical thinking skills, despite their best efforts at indoctrination, that we truly see.
I'm not sure how seriously to take Russia-insider as I haven't looked into it enough, but this would hardly be surprising.  They were still on a roll from taking out the democratically elected leader of Iran, Mossadeq, in 1953.  How many years was it before this was common knowledge?

[Random snipping ahead to reply inline while on my mobile, apologies]
[Georgi]> btw, does rowhammer escape VM? (appears to me yes).
I think it does, but I've not done enough testing on my own to be sure.
Yep, agreed.  I meant that I also use VM on my crappy airgapped box, even though it doesn't matter as much as my other boxes of importance or networked laptops etc. VM should be pretty standard security fare, and yet nothing is 100% secure.  We do what we can, adding layers so that it may slow down any threats.  There is no way to be absolutely secure, it's a sad fact of modern life. But we don't have to make it easy for the bastards, you know?
Automated TiBU + weekly manual backups of media to external drive?  That's what I do; couldn't pay me to use a cloud backup.  Same as with people complaining about the first Blackphone not having access to GAPPs/ Google Play (...seriously?), do u even sideload bro?  Do it regularly when you're managing your other data backups, it's quick and painless after the initial I'm surprised to hear that come from you.  I've never used a cloud backup and the most I've ever lost is a day or two's worth of data/ media.  I have redundant backups.  It's not difficult (it truly isn't, I'm not trying to be snotty.)
Do you mean the same lusers who broadcast the fact that they're on vacation all over Failbook, post photos with GPS enabled and are then surprised when their home is burglarized?
Sadly, it's not a "thing" anywhere right now.  Not when EC has been intentionally weakened, etc.  Hell, even if crApple did have true full disc encryption, I wouldn't use their closed source crapware.
"Essential" is very much a subjective term.  I don't mind most of my web browsing experience looking like plaintext (in fact, I much prefer it.)  However, I understand most people do not want to use the web in that way.  We all make concessions we consider acceptable, sacrificing privacy/security for convenience.  I'm guilty of it, too.  Anyone with a smartphone and a credit/debit card is as well.

Wow, what the hell is going on here?!
I'm replying to all of the posts made thus far on this topic; I'm sorry, but I don't have the time nor inclination to respond to them individually.
So John finally replies, but feels the need to call this guy an asshole.  Why is that?  I don't know him, but going solely by his site and contributions to archive.org, he is a legitimate researcher.  He tried going through the usual steps before disclosure, just like the rest of us do.  Only brought it to the public for verification and analysis after the source refused to cooperate: just like the rest of us.  Problem?
There are no sacred cows.  There is only data, and whatever truth is borne out of it whether or not it's the answer we wish to see.  The scientific method and all, you know, that most of us hold dear.
Georgi, he didn't outright say Snowden was a liar.  He was calling into question the validity of a slide that Snowden may not have even seen, or may not have scrutinized.
Also, the journalists releasing the data have an open history of working with the feds before releasing info - how do we know they wouldn't possibly alter data under pressure?  A decade ago, no less than the venerable NYT sat on the warrantless wiretapping story for over a year!  They caved when Risen's book was about to be published.  That does not exactly inspire But what if this (or any other claim, backed with evidence) *did* call into question the rest of the data attributed to the Snowden dumps?  Isn't the truth more important than holding up false ideals?  Religion and politics have the lock on that brand of cognitive dissonance, they don't need our help.
Snowden is not infallible.
Cryptome/JY are not infallible.
Hell, even Ellsberg isn't infallible (as we were recently reminded.)
Best is not infallible, but I haven't seen him claim to be so.  Don't judge the messenger; look at the data and draw your own conclusions, the way we do with everything else.

You're right about the privacy aspect, but still missing the entire point.
I don't care about showing up in server logs, although my personal security practices are much different now than they were six years ago.  I may have spotted my own information in the data, and I might be able to prove it (the Palm Pre is in a box 'o bits & crap somewhere.)
The bigger picture is not why Cryptome appears to be distributing old log files, but validity of the GHCQ slide in question.  That's why all the data is being put up for scrutiny, and we are losing sight of the importance of it with all the noise.
Doesn't matter if JY is a fed asset.  Doesn't matter if Best is a troll with a personal vendetta against JY/Cryptome (neither of which I believe to be true, but still.)
A slide was presented as being part of the Snowden dump.  A researcher has shown that with these log files, anyone could have made this slide.  This is a Big Fucking Deal with possibly numerous implications about a much larger dataset.
Forget about who is saying what and just look at the data and draw your own conclusions.  We are better than this.

When the logs have been distributed by Cryptome via USB and torrents as part of the archive for over a year?  Yeah, it's fair game.

He did post a redacted version.  Then JYA accused him of everything from faking the data to being a spy.
When we post about vulns on FD/ wherever, we follow the process of notifying and following up before posting publicly - which we only do when devs or corps refuse to acknowledge or outright deny.  Right?  That's exactly how he went about it, and then was attacked in a most nonsensical manner (we didn't even get a notorious JYA poetic diatribe!)
In addition, as previously mentioned, these datasets have been in the wild for > 1yr.  As someone who may have found my own data in the access logs, I still say he did the right thing.

@_subject: Why cryptome sold web logs to their paying customers? 
The Cryptome archives *are* publicly accessible.  John limits bots and leechers to a certain number of files per day (as is his right, he is paying for the bandwidth), approx 100 iirc, but anyone who can use search strings can find anything on the site.
In the past, John has given his blessing to uploading the Cryptome archives to the torrents.  The files number close to 100K: I would not expect someone to inspect each document and folder of a public archive before uploading it, but Mike Best took the extra step to contact JY when he saw the log files and asked if those were part of the public archive or if they'd been included by mistake.  If it had been resolved at that time, the log files would not have been published and we would not be having this particular discussion.
We can see from the hash on coderman's torrent from 2014 that those same log files were indeed included on the USB drives sent out by Cryptome and in the archives John uploaded a few months ago for us to seed on torrents.  (Which, incidentally, I'd planned on seeding as well, until my seeder box bit the dust and I have yet to replace it. I can tell you I would *not* have parsed 98,000 files before seeding the torrent.)
I haven't yet stated my personal opinion on this because I have wanted this to be about the slide in question.  I've been taken aback by the attacks on the researcher and I am worried that it's going to scare off the next person with important info to share.  That's a lose/lose situation.
There is no clear answer here.  Yes, we are all responsible for our own opsec.  Absolutely. If we access the clearnet without encryption we are leaving digital DNA everywhere and we get to face the consequences.  This incident is a good reminder of this fact.
Should access logs be kept for that long?  Absolutely not.  From what I have read in the email exchange that was posted, the log files were included in a NetSol total restore.  My guess is that John/Cryptome did not intentionally keep these files, and did not realize these files were included in the archive.  When I do incremental backups or updates on my own systems, I don't usually go back and check the integrity of files I've already archived in my closed system.  I can see where this could be an honest mistake that has gotten blown way out of proportion.  It's a good lesson to be more aware of these types of glitches.
Can we collectively agree that it's not an ideal situation, but that we are all human and, as such, make mistakes - and just move on to the real issue of the veracity/provenance of the slide attributed to the GCHQ, which purportedly shows the (illegal) interception of the data of Cryptome visitors?
That's the real issue here, and it *does* matter.  I implore us all to let the noise die down and get to the matter at hand.
Yes, with UKUSA / five eyes, GCHQ likely gets access to this type of data from the NSA just for the asking.  That, too, is not the point in this

You don't take the permission to upload the same information JY allowed to be uploaded to public torrents as implied permission to post the *same* files on archive.org?
Also, before Best posted anything at all, he contacted John.  Twice.  JY could have expressed his disapproval at that time.  We know about it because Best posted it to the list: how many other mirrors are there?  Will you find them, check them all for the log files in question and chastise those posters as well?
Cryptome has never endorsed the authenticity of any specific mirrors, but has never discouraged the mirroring of the archives (at least not to my knowledge, and I've been around for a while.)
As I've stated, I'm fairly certain my info is in the dataset and it's on me for not employing better personal browsing security.  I'm not angry with any of the parties involved; sunlight is the best disinfectant, and this discussion can become a positive thing if serves to remind us that despite best intentions, someone, somewhere, is always watching and it is up to us to protect ourselves.

Not Google specifically, but here is one example of the highly invasive tracking of much, much more than web logs:
"Verizon is giving a new mission to its controversial identifier that tracks users that tracks users of mobile devices.  Verizon said in a little noticed announcement that it will
soon begin sharing the profiles with AOL's ad network, which in turn monitors users across a large swath of the Internet.
That means AOL's ad network will be able to match millions of Internet users to their real-world details gathered by Verizon, including  "your gender, age range and interests." AOL's network is on 40 percent of websites, including on ProPublica.  AOL will also be able to use data from Verizon's identifier to track the apps that mobile users open, what sites they visit, and for how long. Verizon purchased AOL earlier this year."

Michael Best bbrewer has made a good point, actually.  If someone is served a NSL, they are gagged - prohibited by law from saying anything about it.  Look at Nick from Calyx: after a decade, his gag order has finally been lifted but there is still a 90-day period during which the gag remains intact to give the feds time to appeal.  It's crazy stuff.
Even if JY did it to "make a point" about all security being illusory BS, the log files dropped are old enough that they probably wouldn't cause much harm.  The same basic argument used by Wikileaks when they dropped the State Dept cables.

What is being put forth for discussion and review is the following:
With the log files that were included in the Cryptome archive,
*anyone* with access to those files could have made that slide,
because the data in the log files are from the same time period referred to in the slide.
Why is this so hard to comprehend?  I feel like this list has branched off into some alternate timeline where logic and critical thinking do not exist!

Excerpt from 2003 subpoena, via  ----- BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE -----

COMMONWEALTH OF MASSACHUSETTS
I, John Young, administrator of Cryptome, hereby declare that logs of Cryptome are deleted daily, or more often during heavy traffic, to protect the privacy of visitors to the site. Cryptome does not own or know the location of the machine which hosts its virtual private server under a service agreement with NTT Verio. There are several international mirrors of the files on Cryptome, all of which, to the best of my knowledge, delete logs to protect privacy of visitors.

 John Young So, its been a day since this was posted.  It appears as though neither JYA nor Cryptome have been compromised and the posts and tweets that have followed appear to be authentic JY.
I've been a bit busy today, so - have I missed it?  John's explanation of why he would keep access logs going back to 1996, when it was posted on Cryptome itself for years that logs were deleted daily or better - and he gave an affidavit to a grand jury stating that he had no such files?  Or perhaps why he wants to sell out in the first place?
If he's tired of doing it, I get it.  If he wants to enjoy his remaining time on the planet instead of dealing with this BS, more power to him.  But why go out this way?  The legacy he has built with that site is being crushed.  Without Cryptome, there would likely be no Wikileaks.  No Manning, no Snowden.
This isn't just about being identified in the logs, but their very existence.  Those of you who insist on trying to divert the conversation away by blaming people for not being behind 7 proxies are just wasting space.  We know, we preach it too!  That is not the point.
Personally, I don't give a fck if my info is in the log files.  If I did, I surely would not be posting to public lists about it.  I'm probably on enough "watch lists" already that visiting Cryptome isn't going to make a damn bit of difference.
No, I'm concerned for sources that gave info and documents to Cryptome.  For people in countries where they possibly face dire consequences for even viewing such info (jail, torture, even death.)
It's not funny, and it's not right.  From what I've heard, a bunch of us would really appreciate an explanation from John - in plain English.

Very well said!
There are situations where crypto is required.  We should do everything we can to help people learn to use it, especially to facilitate their communications when secrecy is absolutely necessary.
Yes, it's sometimes fun to encrypt fuck-off messages to the spooks inside lolcats.  But I've reached a point where I'm tiring of the cat-and-mouse game 24/7.  Encrypting *everything* frustrates them, but to me it also signals that we expect they are monitoring everything without cause or suspicion (in violation of the 4th amendment and many other laws of sovereign nations, worldwide) and we are giving them tacit permission to continue to do so.
Those who understand encryption and can use it correctly are still a relatively small minority.  I feel like "encrypting everything" just because *I* can, while the majority of the planet has never even heard of Whit Diffie or elliptical curve, sort of defeats the purpose.
We can protect ourselves (and in some cases, at this point in time, encryption is mandatory to our personal safety - but should not be used as false security), but dismantling the surveillance machine that captures everyone's emails to grandma, catalogues every single purchase and aids in the perversion of justice (via parallel construction, etc) seems to me to be the nobler goal.

That doesn't make it right, Doc.  At least one copy of the archives containing the logs has been seeded for over a year (that we are aware of.)  If you saw the access logs, wouldn't you privately contact John to ask if they should be in there?
That's what Mike did.  Because there is a larger question of whether they could have been used to forge a slide, it became a more complex matter.  When John ignored him and then attacked him and accused him of faking the data, he came here.  At that point, what else could he really do?
John says the log files have now been removed from the archive.  If Mike had remained quiet, as you seem to be suggesting, they'd still be in there.
I don't want to reignite the shitstorm, which is one reason why I've been quiet - and I'm very sad to see Cathal leave the list over it (I hope Eugen doesn't smack him for directing the noise his way ;) but this whole thing has been just too strange.

I reflected upon that after I had already run my mouth about it.  It didn't seem to be presented as a quote, or a "look at this BS I found!" post.  As I said, I'd basically ignored it until others began commenting about who was/was not on the list.
Looking at it the other way: which set might include people like coderman, Jim Bell, Brian Carroll... mk @ desu = liberté.  Nadim K?
If this is someone else's list, it makes no sense to me that coderman would be on it (if it were indeed a list of "crackpots and cranks.")  He files a lot of FOIA requests, and that probably irks a fair number of people with an interest in keeping the info hidden.
Jim: he needs no further explanation.  A glorious thorn in the side of a bunch of people would couldn't deserve it more.
And, so on...
It could be some kind of tactic to attempt to squelch voices of dissent/advocates of crypto, sure.  They've been doing such things long before Snowden found out about it.  Perhaps if I ask nicely, coderman will enlighten us as to whether this filter is a list of his own or a random pastebin he happened upon?

Truth.  Making people think they must have useless crap... and hey, mindless consuming = economic stimulus, so now you're patriotic! It's pernicious and deceitful.
This manipulative propaganda has incredibly negative effects it has on the very concept of self.  It sets up unrealistic expectations of everything from self image to gender roles.  A complete distortion of what society is and what really matters in life.
They'll say anything to make a buck, and it *must* be true because it's on the tee vee!  You know, the home of "reality" shows and "fair and balanced news" for which you should "lean forward." (Left, right - all are corrupt and pwned by the same damn corporate pigs. Same hand, different puppet.)

- Think before you buy.  Try to support true fair trade/fair wages and buy locally whenever possible.  Hint: it's usually possible.
- Use a bike or public transit whenever possible.  Get rid of your car and use things like Zip Car for the few occasions when you need to use a personal vehicle.  Share a car with friends if you truly need it for - Prepare your own damn food.  Go vegan.

[Snipping as needed.  Warning: it is lengthy.]
I facepalmed so hard when I read this.  I support and agree with both Razer's and Juan's replies to this post; I just didn't want to offend the netiquette-sensitive by posting +1 to both replies.
All of these:
Totally miss the point.  Totally.
You seem to be speaking from a position where it sounds like money is the focal point, the most important factor.  To me, it is the least important part of the equation.
Ever heard of voluntary simplicity?  It's a concept I have embraced for all of my adult life.  I don't have much money because I don't want it.  I don't use many resources because I like to tread lightly upon the earth, and I don't think it's fair if I have an abundance of something while others have none.  I'm not a capitalist, never have been nor will I ever be.  I agree with Razor's view of capitalism.  Juan's, too.
Nor do I have a god delusion that lets me shit all over the earth, be horrible to people and do whatever else I want as long as I say the magic words in a prayer and put an offering of filthy lucre in a basket for absolution.   This is the only shot I get at not being a totally useless garbage person.  My conscience won't allow me to mindlessly consume at the expense of the planet and other people.  I'm not sorry for that.
One aspect of the human cost of "shiny new crap" has already been pointed out by Razer.  I wasn't talking about the monetary cost to you (although paying €200/mo for a phone and laptop is incredibly unnecessary, imho.  But I like to have control over the operating systems of my devices, and see no reason to upgrade hardware to newer models if they're in good working order and meeting my needs.)
Do you get no sense of personal satisfaction from repairing something that would have gone into a landfill?  Or of building something exactly how you want it instead of buying overpriced, pressed particleboard crap that is toxic to both humans and the environment?  Where is your hacker ethic, man?
More appropriate is the question, what wouldn't you trade?  Things you no longer use or need for something you do.  Skills you have, for some your neighbor has (can be as simple as I'll help you repair and paint your porch, you help me sow and plant my garden.)  Trading child/ elder/ pet care, shared meals, errands... do you really have no friends or neighbors with whom you do this?
The list of what one wouldn't buy secondhand is much shorter. Yes, you can go into the Gap and buy a pair of pants for €70... but why would you want to?  So what if it takes me an hour to look through thrift store racks - for that $70, I'd come out with several pairs of perfectly nice pants, skirts, shirts... it's madness.
 I have a dresser for which I paid $20 at a thrift store, over 20 years ago.  It is made of sturdy, solid wood and in excellent condition, has survived cross-country trips and countless local moves.  Good luck with your Walmart junk!
That hour I "wasted" saving hundreds of $ or € in a thrift store?  I'll get it back by using commute time to read and catch up on things while taking the bus or train.  You'd be stuck driving in traffic (if you lived in my city; not sure how it is where you live), all stressed out.
What I don't buy used: undergarments, pillows, etc.  But I won't ever buy them at Walmart, either.
No. That's why I said *true* fair trade, a living fucking wage.  Not a bag of coffee from a corporate behemoth with a fake stamp on it.  Please, tell me you knew that and are just being cheeky?
So are you saying that you're okay with people working in slave labor conditions & being paid subhuman wages, polluting the atmosphere by transporting this stuff for thousands of miles... instead of supporting the local businesses in your own community, if the price is right?  I can't even answer this.  Not without flaming.  I can't.
I don't intrinsically hate cars.  As was already mentioned, does everyone really need one (or more) of them, though?  Your CBA is flawed because, again, you're only thinking of yourself.  Your convenience, your money.  There is an entire world around you.  You could start by cutting back on the amount of damage you do to it.
Public transport sucks sometimes, no doubt.  Get involved to make it better.  It's not wasted time if you use it to read, learn something new, chat with someone, or post random bullshit to public internet lists ;)
On nice days, biking is good exercise for those who are able.  Most of us don't get enough exercise as it is.
It is not ANY of these things.  Use that time on the bus to learn how to cook basic stuff!  Cook on the weekend while hanging out with friends/family or rocking out to music and make your lunches and dinner main dishes for the entire next week.  How is that not saving time, money and being good for your health?
It is, and much better for your health as well (not to mention, better for the animals!)
If the meat industry wasn't subsidized, you'd be paying $20/lb for hamburger.  If you're truly interested, read Diet for a New America by John Robbins (who was heir to The Baskin-Robbins ice cream fortune and walked away from it all to lead a vegan, ethical life.)
It has America in the title but is applicable to all (we are just among the worst offenders, as with most things.)  There are several documentaries that show the horrors of factory farming; I'll list some if you'd like.  Not only is it barbaric, it is extremely unhealthy for you.
Razer and Juan answered the rest of this with much more grace than I would.  Wouldnt want my "fuck" counter to push me higher on the offensiveness list ;)

Sane...yes.  Well that explains the Wall St vultures, then!
Right, and I do understand that.  While I truly wish we lived in a world where could trade and barter for everything, the ISP and utility companies want actual payment for services ;)
As was mentioned, nothing is pure or perfect.  Doing the best we can, which will be different for everyone, is the goal.  Some people really need to have a car.  I don't, so I do not.
A friend and I do our grocery shopping together.  He has a car because of work;  I very often take care of his cat.   I'm not going to pretend that I can walk or bike home with an armload of groceries and 13 kg of cat litter, lol.  We get to catch up and the chore of shopping goes by quickly.
Right on, Zenaan!  (Sounds like we're about the same age, too.)  It's been about as long since I watched tv on a regular basis as well.  For my few indulgences, like The Walking Dead (yep, vegan pacifist likes zombie apocalypse. Hannibal, too!  Save the animals, Eat the Rude :D ), I go watch with friends.  More fun that way anyway.
I, um, may have downloaded Mr Robot.  Shhh.
There are several hacker spaces and maker spaces in my city, and many informal gatherings.  I'm very fortunate :)
Well, yes.  Being mindful isn't always easy, but does lead to a more fulfilling existence.  It's more of... just trying to be a decent human, as I see it?  We're all stuck on this rock spinning in space. We may as well be decent to each other, things seem to be better that way.
What other rational choice is there?  Arbitrary boundaries of countries are drawn and redrawn like a game of Risk played in a dorm room, and with far less care; they mean nothing, in the humanistic sense.  We're all in the same damn boat.  We sink or swim, together.
Note: boundaries of other countries never seem to matter to the jerks who run mine, for a much different reason.  I am sorry, world.  More than I can So, yes.  I feel that all of our choices have a global impact, one way or another.  I try to tip the scales in favor of the greater good, when I can.

You're absolutely right.  We USians (or Americunts, as Juan says, which always makes me laugh in agreement), only have propaganda "textbooks" in school.  It's not unless/until we are fortunate enough to stumble upon Howard Zinn's books or develop critical thinking skills, despite their best efforts at indoctrination, that we truly see.
I'm not sure how seriously to take Russia-insider as I haven't looked into it enough, but this would hardly be surprising.  They were still on a roll from taking out the democratically elected leader of Iran, Mossadeq, in 1953.  How many years was it before this was common knowledge?

Yep, agreed.  I meant that I also use VM on my crappy airgapped box, even though it doesn't matter as much as my other boxes of importance or networked laptops etc. VM should be pretty standard security fare, and yet nothing is 100% secure.  We do what we can, adding layers so that it may slow down any threats.  There is no way to be absolutely secure, it's a sad fact of modern life. But we don't have to make it easy for the bastards, you know?
Automated TiBU + weekly manual backups of media to external drive?  That's what I do; couldn't pay me to use a cloud backup.

Wow, what the hell is going on here?!
I'm replying to all of the posts made thus far on this topic; I'm sorry, but I don't have the time nor inclination to respond to them individually.
So John finally replies, but feels the need to call this guy an asshole.  Why is that?  I don't know him, but going solely by his site and contributions to archive.org, he is a legitimate researcher.  He tried going through the usual steps before disclosure, just like the rest of us do.  Only brought it to the public for verification and analysis after the source refused to cooperate: just like the rest of us.  Problem?
There are no sacred cows.  There is only data, and whatever truth is borne out of it whether or not it's the answer we wish to see.  The scientific method and all, you know, that most of us hold dear.
Georgi, he didn't outright say Snowden was a liar.  He was calling into question the validity of a slide that Snowden may not have even seen, or may not have scrutinized.
Also, the journalists releasing the data have an open history of working with the feds before releasing info - how do we know they wouldn't possibly alter data under pressure?  A decade ago, no less than the venerable NYT sat on the warrantless wiretapping story for over a year!  They caved when Risen's book was about to be published.  That does not exactly inspire But what if this (or any other claim, backed with evidence) *did* call into question the rest of the data attributed to the Snowden dumps?  Isn't the truth more important than holding up false ideals?  Religion and politics have the lock on that brand of cognitive dissonance, they don't need our help.
Snowden is not infallible.
Cryptome/JY are not infallible.
Hell, even Ellsberg isn't infallible (as we were recently reminded.)
Best is not infallible, but I haven't seen him claim to be so.  Don't judge the messenger; look at the data and draw your own conclusions, the way we do with everything else.

You're right about the privacy aspect, but still missing the entire point.
I don't care about showing up in server logs, although my personal security practices are much different now than they were six years ago.  I may have spotted my own information in the data, and I might be able to prove it (the Palm Pre is in a box 'o bits & crap somewhere.)
The bigger picture is not why Cryptome appears to be distributing old log files, but validity of the GHCQ slide in question.  That's why all the data is being put up for scrutiny, and we are losing sight of the importance of it with all the noise.
Doesn't matter if JY is a fed asset.  Doesn't matter if Best is a troll with a personal vendetta against JY/Cryptome (neither of which I believe to be true, but still.)
A slide was presented as being part of the Snowden dump.  A researcher has shown that with these log files, anyone could have made this slide.  This is a Big Fucking Deal with possibly numerous implications about a much larger dataset.

When we post about vulns on FD/ wherever, we follow the process of notifying and following up before posting publicly - which we only do when devs or corps refuse to acknowledge or outright deny.  Right?  That's exactly how he went about it, and then was attacked in a most nonsensical manner (we didn't even get a notorious JYA poetic diatribe!)
In addition, as previously mentioned, these datasets have been in the wild for > 1yr.  As someone who may have found my own data in the access logs, I still say he did the right thing.

@_subject: Why cryptome sold web logs to their paying customers? 
The Cryptome archives *are* publicly accessible.  John limits bots and leechers to a certain number of files per day (as is his right, he is paying for the bandwidth), approx 100 iirc, but anyone who can use search strings can find anything on the site.
In the past, John has given his blessing to uploading the Cryptome archives to the torrents.  The files number close to 100K: I would not expect someone to inspect each document and folder of a public archive before uploading it, but Mike Best took the extra step to contact JY when he saw the log files and asked if those were part of the public archive or if they'd been included by mistake.  If it had been resolved at that time, the log files would not have been published and we would not be having this particular discussion.
We can see from the hash on coderman's torrent from 2014 that those same log files were indeed included on the USB drives sent out by Cryptome and in the archives John uploaded a few months ago for us to seed on torrents.  (Which, incidentally, I'd planned on seeding as well, until my seeder box bit the dust and I have yet to replace it. I can tell you I would *not* have parsed 98,000 files before seeding the torrent.)
I haven't yet stated my personal opinion on this because I have wanted this to be about the slide in question.  I've been taken aback by the attacks on the researcher and I am worried that it's going to scare off the next person with important info to share.  That's a lose/lose situation.
There is no clear answer here.  Yes, we are all responsible for our own opsec.  Absolutely. If we access the clearnet without encryption we are leaving digital DNA everywhere and we get to face the consequences.  This incident is a good reminder of this fact.
Should access logs be kept for that long?  Absolutely not.  From what I have read in the email exchange that was posted, the log files were included in a NetSol total restore.  My guess is that John/Cryptome did not intentionally keep these files, and did not realize these files were included in the archive.  When I do incremental backups or updates on my own systems, I don't usually go back and check the integrity of files I've already archived in my closed system.  I can see where this could be an honest mistake that has gotten blown way out of proportion.  It's a good lesson to be more aware of these types of glitches.
Can we collectively agree that it's not an ideal situation, but that we are all human and, as such, make mistakes - and just move on to the real issue of the veracity/provenance of the slide attributed to the GCHQ, which purportedly shows the (illegal) interception of the data of Cryptome visitors?
That's the real issue here, and it *does* matter.  I implore us all to let the noise die down and get to the matter at hand.
Yes, with UKUSA / five eyes, GCHQ likely gets access to this type of data from the NSA just for the asking.  That, too, is not the point in this

You don't take the permission to upload the same information JY allowed to be uploaded to public torrents as implied permission to post the *same* files on archive.org?
Also, before Best posted anything at all, he contacted John.  Twice.  JY could have expressed his disapproval at that time.  We know about it because Best posted it to the list: how many other mirrors are there?  Will you find them, check them all for the log files in question and chastise those posters as well?
Cryptome has never endorsed the authenticity of any specific mirrors, but has never discouraged the mirroring of the archives (at least not to my knowledge, and I've been around for a while.)
As I've stated, I'm fairly certain my info is in the dataset and it's on me for not employing better personal browsing security.  I'm not angry with any of the parties involved; sunlight is the best disinfectant, and this discussion can become a positive thing if serves to remind us that despite best intentions, someone, somewhere, is always watching and it is up to us to protect ourselves.

Not Google specifically, but here is one example of the highly invasive tracking of much, much more than web logs:
"Verizon is giving a new mission to its controversial identifier that tracks users that tracks users of mobile devices.  Verizon said in a little noticed announcement that it will
soon begin sharing the profiles with AOL's ad network, which in turn monitors users across a large swath of the Internet.
That means AOL's ad network will be able to match millions of Internet users to their real-world details gathered by Verizon, including  "your gender, age range and interests." AOL's network is on 40 percent of websites, including on ProPublica.  AOL will also be able to use data from Verizon's identifier to track the apps that mobile users open, what sites they visit, and for how long. Verizon purchased AOL earlier this year."

So, its been a day since this was posted.  It appears as though neither JYA nor Cryptome have been compromised and the posts and tweets that have followed appear to be authentic JY.
I've been a bit busy today, so - have I missed it?  John's explanation of why he would keep access logs going back to 1996, when it was posted on Cryptome itself for years that logs were deleted daily or better - and he gave an affidavit to a grand jury stating that he had no such files?  Or perhaps why he wants to sell out in the first place?
If he's tired of doing it, I get it.  If he wants to enjoy his remaining time on the planet instead of dealing with this BS, more power to him.  But why go out this way?  The legacy he has built with that site is being crushed.  Without Cryptome, there would likely be no Wikileaks.  No Manning, no Snowden.
This isn't just about being identified in the logs, but their very existence.  Those of you who insist on trying to divert the conversation away by blaming people for not being behind 7 proxies are just wasting space.  We know, we preach it too!  That is not the point.
Personally, I don't give a fck if my info is in the log files.  If I did, I surely would not be posting to public lists about it.  I'm probably on enough "watch lists" already that visiting Cryptome isn't going to make a damn bit of difference.
No, I'm concerned for sources that gave info and documents to Cryptome.  For people in countries where they possibly face dire consequences for even viewing such info (jail, torture, even death.)
It's not funny, and it's not right.  From what I've heard, a bunch of us would really appreciate an explanation from John - in plain English.

This is why it matters:
John Young is listed as a Truth Teller and a Whistleblower.  He is mentioned on the same pages as Chelsea Manning, sitting in prison.  In the same breath as Edward Snowden.  Thomas Drake.  Mark Klein.  You get the This is why it matters.  Whether John Young deserves to be there among people who have truly risked everything to tell the truth is something only his actions will demonstrate.

Very well said!
There are situations where crypto is required.  We should do everything we can to help people learn to use it, especially to facilitate their communications when secrecy is absolutely necessary.
Yes, it's sometimes fun to encrypt fuck-off messages to the spooks inside lolcats.  But I've reached a point where I'm tiring of the cat-and-mouse game 24/7.  Encrypting *everything* frustrates them, but to me it also signals that we expect they are monitoring everything without cause or suspicion (in violation of the 4th amendment and many other laws of sovereign nations, worldwide) and we are giving them tacit permission to continue to do so.
Those who understand encryption and can use it correctly are still a relatively small minority.  I feel like "encrypting everything" just because *I* can, while the majority of the planet has never even heard of Whit Diffie or elliptical curve, sort of defeats the purpose.
We can protect ourselves (and in some cases, at this point in time, encryption is mandatory to our personal safety - but should not be used as false security), but dismantling the surveillance machine that captures everyone's emails to grandma, catalogues every single purchase and aids in the perversion of justice (via parallel construction, etc) seems to me to be the nobler goal.
Just my .02.

That doesn't make it right, Doc.  At least one copy of the archives containing the logs has been seeded for over a year (that we are aware of.)  If you saw the access logs, wouldn't you privately contact John to ask if they should be in there?
That's what Mike did.  Because there is a larger question of whether they could have been used to forge a slide, it became a more complex matter.  When John ignored him and then attacked him and accused him of faking the data, he came here.  At that point, what else could he really do?
John says the log files have now been removed from the archive.  If Mike had remained quiet, as you seem to be suggesting, they'd still be in there.
I don't want to reignite the shitstorm, which is one reason why I've been quiet - and I'm very sad to see Cathal leave the list over it (I hope Eugen doesn't smack him for directing the noise his way ;) but this whole thing has been just too strange.

> What makes you think that it's coderman's list?
I reflected upon that after I had already run my mouth about it.  It didn't seem to be presented as a quote, or a "look at this BS I found!" post.  As I said, I'd basically ignored it until others began commenting about who was/was not on the list.
Looking at it the other way: which set might include people like coderman, Jim Bell, Brian Carroll... mk @ desu = liberté.  Nadim K?
If this is someone else's list, it makes no sense to me that coderman would be on it (if it were indeed a list of "crackpots and cranks.")  He files a lot of FOIA requests, and that probably irks a fair number of people with an interest in keeping the info hidden.
Jim: he needs no further explanation.  A glorious thorn in the side of a bunch of people would couldn't deserve it more.
And, so on...
It could be some kind of tactic to attempt to squelch voices of dissent/advocates of crypto, sure.  They've been doing such things long before Snowden found out about it.  Perhaps if I ask nicely, coderman will enlighten us as to whether this filter is a list of his own or a random pastebin he happened upon?

As for eugenics... I have chosen it for myself.  Someone pissed in my family's gene pool ages ago and I refuse to propagate that mess.  I wish other people in my family had the same view.
Looking at the state of this planet, there appear to be many other people for whom that would be a wise choice.  That's not for me or anyone else to decide, though.  Merely my opinion, which ain't worth much.

A post which I agree with, 100%.  Comments inline.
Yep!  Milgram thoroughly discredited the "only following orders" excuse decades ago.  (Look deeper the initial study they always talk about in popular media; Milgram repeated that experiment covering nearly every variable, at least 40 of them.  0% (zero) of participants continued administering the faux, potentially damaging/fatal shocks when told "you have no choice." Z e r o.)
There are not enough +1s I can give you for this.
Truth.  Making people think they must have useless crap... and hey, mindless consuming = economic stimulus, so now you're patriotic! It's pernicious and deceitful.
This manipulative propaganda has incredibly negative effects it has on the very concept of self.  It sets up unrealistic expectations of everything from self image to gender roles.  A complete distortion of what society is and what really matters in life.
They'll say anything to make a buck, and it *must* be true because it's on the tee vee!  You know, the home of "reality" shows and "fair and balanced news" for which you should "lean forward." (Left, right - all are corrupt and pwned by the same damn corporate pigs. Same hand, different puppet.)

Suggestions, in no particular order:
- Don't buy the newest iCrap (or car or tv) every time they shit one out: you *don't * need it, I assure you.
- Learn how to fix and repurpose things.  Take good care of your things so they last longer.
- Freecycle, trade with others
- Shop at second hand and thrift stores for most things.
- Think before you buy.  Try to support true fair trade/fair wages and buy locally whenever possible.  Hint: it's usually possible.
- Use a bike or public transit whenever possible.  Get rid of your car and use things like Zip Car for the few occasions when you need to use a personal vehicle.  Share a car with friends if you truly need it for - Prepare your own damn food.  Go vegan.

[Snipping as needed.  Warning: it is lengthy.]
I facepalmed so hard when I read this.  I support and agree with both Razer's and Juan's replies to this post; I just didn't want to offend the netiquette-sensitive by posting +1 to both replies.
All of these:
Totally miss the point.  Totally.
You seem to be speaking from a position where it sounds like money is the focal point, the most important factor.  To me, it is the least important part of the equation.
Ever heard of voluntary simplicity?  It's a concept I have embraced for all of my adult life.  I don't have much money because I don't want it.  I don't use many resources because I like to tread lightly upon the earth, and I don't think it's fair if I have an abundance of something while others have none.  I'm not a capitalist, never have been nor will I ever be.  I agree with Razor's view of capitalism.  Juan's, too.
Nor do I have a god delusion that lets me shit all over the earth, be horrible to people and do whatever else I want as long as I say the magic words in a prayer and put an offering of filthy lucre in a basket for absolution.   This is the only shot I get at not being a totally useless garbage person.  My conscience won't allow me to mindlessly consume at the expense of the planet and other people.  I'm not sorry for that.
One aspect of the human cost of "shiny new crap" has already been pointed out by Razer.  I wasn't talking about the monetary cost to you (although paying €200/mo for a phone and laptop is incredibly unnecessary, imho.  But I like to have control over the operating systems of my devices, and see no reason to upgrade hardware to newer models if they're in good working order and meeting my needs.)
Do you get no sense of personal satisfaction from repairing something that would have gone into a landfill?  Or of building something exactly how you want it instead of buying overpriced, pressed particleboard crap that is toxic to both humans and the environment?  Where is your hacker ethic, man?
More appropriate is the question, what wouldn't you trade?  Things you no longer use or need for something you do.  Skills you have, for some your neighbor has (can be as simple as I'll help you repair and paint your porch, you help me sow and plant my garden.)  Trading child/ elder/ pet care, shared meals, errands... do you really have no friends or neighbors with whom you do this?
The list of what one wouldn't buy secondhand is much shorter. Yes, you can go into the Gap and buy a pair of pants for €70... but why would you want to?  So what if it takes me an hour to look through thrift store racks - for that $70, I'd come out with several pairs of perfectly nice pants, skirts, shirts... it's madness.
 I have a dresser for which I paid $20 at a thrift store, over 20 years ago.  It is made of sturdy, solid wood and in excellent condition, has survived cross-country trips and countless local moves.  Good luck with your Walmart junk!
That hour I "wasted" saving hundreds of $ or € in a thrift store?  I'll get it back by using commute time to read and catch up on things while taking the bus or train.  You'd be stuck driving in traffic (if you lived in my city; not sure how it is where you live), all stressed out.
What I don't buy used: undergarments, pillows, etc.  But I won't ever buy them at Walmart, either.
No. That's why I said *true* fair trade, a living fucking wage.  Not a bag of coffee from a corporate behemoth with a fake stamp on it.  Please, tell me you knew that and are just being cheeky?
So are you saying that you're okay with people working in slave labor conditions & being paid subhuman wages, polluting the atmosphere by transporting this stuff for thousands of miles... instead of supporting the local businesses in your own community, if the price is right?  I can't even answer this.  Not without flaming.  I can't.
I don't intrinsically hate cars.  As was already mentioned, does everyone really need one (or more) of them, though?  Your CBA is flawed because, again, you're only thinking of yourself.  Your convenience, your money.  There is an entire world around you.  You could start by cutting back on the amount of damage you do to it.
Public transport sucks sometimes, no doubt.  Get involved to make it better.  It's not wasted time if you use it to read, learn something new, chat with someone, or post random bullshit to public internet lists ;)
On nice days, biking is good exercise for those who are able.  Most of us don't get enough exercise as it is.
It is not ANY of these things.  Use that time on the bus to learn how to cook basic stuff!  Cook on the weekend while hanging out with friends/family or rocking out to music and make your lunches and dinner main dishes for the entire next week.  How is that not saving time, money and being good for your health?
It is, and much better for your health as well (not to mention, better for the animals!)
If the meat industry wasn't subsidized, you'd be paying $20/lb for hamburger.  If you're truly interested, read Diet for a New America by John Robbins (who was heir to The Baskin-Robbins ice cream fortune and walked away from it all to lead a vegan, ethical life.)
It has America in the title but is applicable to all (we are just among the worst offenders, as with most things.)  There are several documentaries that show the horrors of factory farming; I'll list some if you'd like.  Not only is it barbaric, it is extremely unhealthy for you.
Razer and Juan answered the rest of this with much more grace than I would.  Wouldnt want my "fuck" counter to push me higher on the offensiveness list ;)

Sane...yes.  Well that explains the Wall St vultures, then!
Right, and I do understand that.  While I truly wish we lived in a world where could trade and barter for everything, the ISP and utility companies want actual payment for services ;)
As was mentioned, nothing is pure or perfect.  Doing the best we can, which will be different for everyone, is the goal.  Some people really need to have a car.  I don't, so I do not.
A friend and I do our grocery shopping together.  He has a car because of work;  I very often take care of his cat.   I'm not going to pretend that I can walk or bike home with an armload of groceries and 13 kg of cat litter, lol.  We get to catch up and the chore of shopping goes by quickly.
Right on, Zenaan!  (Sounds like we're about the same age, too.)  It's been about as long since I watched tv on a regular basis as well.  For my few indulgences, like The Walking Dead (yep, vegan pacifist likes zombie apocalypse. Hannibal, too!  Save the animals, Eat the Rude :D ), I go watch with friends.  More fun that way anyway.
I, um, may have downloaded Mr Robot.  Shhh.
There are several hacker spaces and maker spaces in my city, and many informal gatherings.  I'm very fortunate :)
Well, yes.  Being mindful isn't always easy, but does lead to a more fulfilling existence.  It's more of... just trying to be a decent human, as I see it?  We're all stuck on this rock spinning in space. We may as well be decent to each other, things seem to be better that way.
What other rational choice is there?  Arbitrary boundaries of countries are drawn and redrawn like a game of Risk played in a dorm room, and with far less care; they mean nothing, in the humanistic sense.  We're all in the same damn boat.  We sink or swim, together.
Note: boundaries of other countries never seem to matter to the jerks who run mine, for a much different reason.  I am sorry, world.  More than I can So, yes.  I feel that all of our choices have a global impact, one way or another.  I try to tip the scales in favor of the greater good, when I can.
Well, fuck.  Ya got me :p

You're absolutely right.  We USians (or Americunts, as Juan says, which always makes me laugh in agreement), only have propaganda "textbooks" in school.  It's not unless/until we are fortunate enough to stumble upon Howard Zinn's books or develop critical thinking skills, despite their best efforts at indoctrination, that we truly see.
I'm not sure how seriously to take Russia-insider as I haven't looked into it enough, but this would hardly be surprising.  They were still on a roll from taking out the democratically elected leader of Iran, Mossadeq, in 1953.  How many years was it before this was common knowledge?

A post about vaccines and autism: exactly what does it have to do with encryption or any other topic even remotely connected to cypherpunks?  Nothing.  That's not an opinion - it is a fact.  Whether I like the topic or think you're fucking nuts is irrelevant, it has nothing to do with crypto (etc.)
There are more appropriate outlets for the types of things you two post.  This isn't it.  It's not a moderated list, and no one wants it to be.  But we generally keep the discussion to some form of crypto/computers/privacy/security etc.  This anti-vaxxer BS has nothing to do with the intended scope of the list.  I generally ignore this list because of the nonsensical mess a few of you have made of it, which has driven off so many others as well.  Back to ignore mode.

@_subject: I'll reveal the scandal I've been sitting on that's on the scale 
cpunks I had a bit of downtime this afternoon so I read the above Wikipedia article that Jim linked to.  I'm mildly disturbed by the fact that I seem to have no recollection of this incident...
On the surface: it appears that a disturbed individual, with a known history of mental illness and an established interest in weapons and/or explosives, had an unspecified familial dispute and crafted a premeditated attack that also involved numerous unaffiliated strangers.
I have not read all the linked articles listed in the reference section, but it does not appear that they are seeking others who may have been involved or carrying out an ongoing investigation.
How are you supposed to have been involved, Ryan?  What reason do they give for this supposed connection?  Is it some bogus parallel construction?
Why did you withdraw your request?
I have no idea of the veracity of the claims made or the soundness of mind of the person making said claims, but I also would not put anything past some of the corrupt LE in this world.
My curiosity is piqued and I'm a neutral party, so I'm all ears/eyes if you'd like to clarify.  Many of us here are skilled at finding things and might be of some help.  I assume that's one reason why you've posted?

@_subject: How long before compulsory microchipping of cattle, I mean, 
What a dreadfully awful series.  I side-eyed my way through parts of the first two episodes, the second only because I wondered how they'd cover grinding/biohacking, and it was so poorly done I could hardly get through it.
There is much ado made about "evil" RFID chips, usually by insane religious whack jobs (e.g. Katherine Albrecht) or scientifically illiterate tinfoil hat-types, but it's much more benign to have some self-selected info contained on a passive chip in a finger than to carry a GPS-enabled tracking device on one's person at all times.
My voluntary chip-implanted info is much more private and secure than the personal info all of you voluntarily divulge on Failbook daily.  Hey, post another "selfie" and be sure to tag all your friends!  Check-in at your favorite restaurant (and don't forget to post pictures of your food, everyone cares about what you're stuffing into your face.)  Post your vacation pictures with the GPS coordinates in the EXIF data.  Let Facebook harvest your contact info!  Make it easy for the feds and every advertiser on Earth to profile you and track your every move.  And then have the nerve to talk about Orwellian surveillance and the "evils" of RFID chips.

@_subject: Shit The FBI Says... 
It's not that easy.  The feds claim that each of those hidden cameras is linked to a federal investigation.  Which is probably total bullshit, but that's their claim.  I'm not sure how much room the mayor has to protest something like that.  Also, Ed Murray is a career politician and I don't think he's anti-LE.  Our previous mayor, Mike McGinn, probably would have put up a fight against such bullshit.  We owe a lot to Ed Murray for advancing LGBTQ equality, but he hasn't been a great mayor.
One other thing: local, state and federal LE get away with a hell of a lot by using Fusion centers.  They can really blur the lines of what is legal and who has jurisdiction by claiming joint operating protection.  It is an unbelievable amount of bullshit (put into place under Bush the Lesser and expanded by Obama.)  Combine that with other atrocities like parallel construction and you have the rogue police state we are now experiencing.

In case you or anyone else is interested in the evolution of recaptcha after google acquired it in 2009 - beginning with using us as free labor to digitize their books, to decoding street addresses for Google maps and on to the Match Game crap we have today:
Warning for sensitive individuals: this image contains a racial slur.  It was what /b/ called the attempt to screw with recaptcha, just including it for relevant reference (so don't send me hate mail):
So, yeah.  We've known from the start that they were using recaptcha as free labor.

What a dreadfully awful series.  I side-eyed my way through parts of the first two episodes, the second only because I wondered how they'd cover grinding/biohacking, and it was so poorly done I could hardly get through it.
There is much ado made about "evil" RFID chips, usually by insane religious whack jobs (e.g. Katherine Albrecht) or scientifically illiterate tinfoil hat-types, but it's much more benign to have some self-selected info contained on a passive chip in a finger than to carry a GPS-enabled tracking device on one's person at all times.
My voluntary chip-implanted info is much more private and secure than the personal info all of you voluntarily divulge on Failbook daily.  Hey, post another "selfie" and be sure to tag all your friends!  Check-in at your favorite restaurant (and don't forget to post pictures of your food, everyone cares about what you're stuffing into your face.)  Post your vacation pictures with the GPS coordinates in the EXIF data.  Let Facebook harvest your contact info!  Make it easy for the feds and every advertiser on Earth to profile you and track your every move.  And then have the nerve to talk about Orwellian surveillance and the "evils" of RFID chips.

It's not that easy.  The feds claim that each of those hidden cameras is linked to a federal investigation.  Which is probably total bullshit, but that's their claim.  I'm not sure how much room the mayor has to protest something like that.  Also, Ed Murray is a career politician and I don't think he's anti-LE.  Our previous mayor, Mike McGinn, probably would have put up a fight against such bullshit.  We owe a lot to Ed Murray for advancing LGBTQ equality, but he hasn't been a great mayor.
One other thing: local, state and federal LE get away with a hell of a lot by using Fusion centers.  They can really blur the lines of what is legal and who has jurisdiction by claiming joint operating protection.  It is an unbelievable amount of bullshit (put into place under Bush the Lesser and expanded by Obama.)  Combine that with other atrocities like parallel construction and you have the rogue police state we are now experiencing.

It's been that way for many years... I'm surprised there is anyone left who didn't know that.  (Not being a smartass.  I think it was 5 or 6 years ago that 4chan had an admittedly poor-taste go at trying to poison the well there.)

In case you or anyone else is interested in the evolution of recaptcha after google acquired it in 2009 - beginning with using us as free labor to digitize their books, to decoding street addresses for Google maps and on to the Match Game crap we have today:
Warning for sensitive individuals: this image contains a racial slur.  It was what /b/ called the attempt to screw with recaptcha, just including it for relevant reference (so don't send me hate mail):
So, yeah.  We've known from the start that they were using recaptcha as free labor.
