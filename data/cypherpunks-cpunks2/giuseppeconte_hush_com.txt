Because he shills against "tribalism".
Same as shilling against "family".
The first step to marxism is destruction of "family" and smaller
"tribal" groups.
And because leafs can't comprehend "freedom".

This isn't even possible and you know it.
Stop spamming your chink webservices.
Pick only one.
You do know that "insult" isn't one.
It means "whip cracker".
Unironically using it to describe Europeans is an act of subservience,
since it was slaves getting whipped; an act of stupidity, since the
Irish and Scot populations were enslaved alongside Africans and also
whipped; and because Africans were "slave owners", as well.
Imagine being this jewish.

Why be redundant ?
'jew' is plenty accurate for all abra[ham]ic slave systems.
"White" includes mexican-spanish speaking populations such as
"Anglo" is a ded breed of mixed-race Germanic larpers.
"Fascist" means "bundle" or "group", and we all know the only people
permitted to organize politically is marxist jews.
Ironic that you are shilling against individuals uniting in opposition
to religous hegemony, which is what is meant when using those words as
an insult.
Confirmed B.O.O.M.E.R. terrosist.
Confirmed never worked with own hands.
**fapping don't count**
These are not the same things.
"Socialism" is bottom-up "Communism".
"Nationalism" is family-first "Socialism".
"Statism" is top-down "Communism", also called "Marxism".
Reminder that "Communism" is "Community-ism".
Without it, people would be driving on private roads, reading in
private libraries, and shitposting on private internets.
