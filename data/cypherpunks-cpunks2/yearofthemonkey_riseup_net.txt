Hey folks,
With the NSA Patriot Act/FBI planes in the news, I recalled an IRL
example from 2004 of Minneapolis FBI anti-terrorism division/department
monitoring my cell, email and MSN Messenger communications.
I mention this because so far all the metadata collection info ruckus
has focused on the NSA.
There's been so much data released as a result of Snowden that I've lost
track. Does anyone recall anything showing the FBI have access to the
NSA's data, or does the FBI have it's own interception going on?
Thanks for any light shed on this.

_The NSA provides data to the FBI and DEA, among others. Although it was
known previously, this is part of what Snowden released with
corroborating documentation. That it hasn't gotten more attention, by
Greenwald, Snowden, et al, is one of the major credible complaints since
the releases began in June 2013. _
Thanks M373, this was what I couldn't put my finger on, it's all been NSA, NSA so far... if the FBI has its own capacity to monitor phone, email, chats, etc., in addition to whatever NSA shares with them, that's a whole other data-sucking structure that needs attention.
