You could do it with a physical one-way function.  Take a photo of the victim
on top of the WTC and you know that it can't have been occurred after 9/11. To
generalise it, photograph the victim in front of some documented object and
then destroy the object.  I'm assuming in the movie-plot scenario that someone
who's kidnapped a victim won't worry about blowing up a statue in a park or
performing whatever the physical one-way operation is.  Depending on how evil
your movie-plot villain is (and how convoluted the plot will get), he/she
could kill random strangers after photographing them with the victim, in order
to fix a point in time.

I got the same response from talking to techies at a large telco, they kept
the records just in case they needed them (not for any specific LEO use, but
just in case they needed the info at some point in the future), and because it
was easier to keep them than to delete them.  In other words, throwing a few
more drives into a server farm was relatively straightforward compared to
figuring out what to delete, when, under what conditions, and how (lots of
different formats, data all over the place, etc).

easier to keep data lying around than to figure out what to delete).

Absolutely.  Some time ago I had a long chat with someone who worked on large-
scale financial processing systems.  Among other things his organisation tends
to act as a stress test for any hardware or software they use since they push
it beyond what anyone else ever manages (and no, it's not HFT, just standard
banking clearing).  Their prime directive is that financial value can never be
created or destroyed, so you can never have a situation in which a failure
anywhere will result in one blob of financial value being recorded in two
locations, or no locations.  Saying that you'll address this by rolling back
transactions won't fly both because no standard database can handle the load
they work at, and because the financial world isn't going to stop and wait
while you perform a rollback.
To give some examples of what this entails, they only use the outer sets of
tracks on their disk arrays to maximise data throughput/minimise head
movement, if they were to use the entire platter the system couldn't keep up.
Cacheing doesn't help, they did try it with the most exotic cacheing
technology that EMC could provide them and found that after X hours throughput
dropped to a fraction of what it had been.  Although EMC had simulated this
situation they never expected that anyone would be able to do it in real life.
They also managed to figure out the computing power of a USG agency using a
certain type of architecture because, when they wanted to buy the entire
production run of a particular just-introduced CPU for several months they
found that an unnamed US customer had already bought six months worth of
production ahead of them.
I think this is about as far from hacking together "some crappy ruby code" as
you can get while still remaining on the same planet.

It's not for nothing that, for example, Tandems are sold under the name
NonStop (they're covered in a case study in the book referenced above).  I was
in a Tandem shop some years ago when it experienced a rapid sequence of power
glitches.  The mass of IT gear in the building needed everything from a reboot
to a reinstall to hardware replacement to get working again.  One of their
techies took me into the mainframe room to the Tandem console, which had a
series of reports "Power lost / Power restored / Power lost / ...".  Apart
from that there had been no effect.
There's a story that during the Loma Prieta earthquake a data centre
containing a Tandem machine was damaged in the quake.  It continued running,
lying on its side surrounded by debris, until they could bring in heavy
equipment to push it upright again.

Absolutely.  Some time ago I had a long chat with someone who worked on large-
scale financial processing systems.  Among other things his organisation tends
to act as a stress test for any hardware or software they use since they push
it beyond what anyone else ever manages (and no, it's not HFT, just standard
banking clearing).  Their prime directive is that financial value can never be
created or destroyed, so you can never have a situation in which a failure
anywhere will result in one blob of financial value being recorded in two
locations, or no locations.  Saying that you'll address this by rolling back
transactions won't fly both because no standard database can handle the load
they work at, and because the financial world isn't going to stop and wait
while you perform a rollback.
To give some examples of what this entails, they only use the outer sets of
tracks on their disk arrays to maximise data throughput/minimise head
movement, if they were to use the entire platter the system couldn't keep up.
Cacheing doesn't help, they did try it with the most exotic cacheing
technology that EMC could provide them and found that after X hours throughput
dropped to a fraction of what it had been.  Although EMC had simulated this
situation they never expected that anyone would be able to do it in real life.
They also managed to figure out the computing power of a USG agency using a
certain type of architecture because, when they wanted to buy the entire
production run of a particular just-introduced CPU for several months they
found that an unnamed US customer had already bought six months worth of
production ahead of them.
I think this is about as far from hacking together "some crappy ruby code" as
you can get while still remaining on the same planet.

Almost.  Its sole use is for very fast "drive erasure", i.e. you change the
key and the data on it becomes inaccessible.  Have a look at this
which describes what Samsung (and others) are doing, in particular slide 18.
The decryption key (DEK) is stored in the drive, and is unlocked using a
password (and "authentication key", AK).  So to decrypt the drive you extract
the encrypted DEK, brute-force the password (AK), and you're in.
In any case though it doesn't protect against an attack that occurs when the
drive is mounted since it looks like an unencrypted drive at that point (and
presumably the AK is hardcoded into a startup script or something similar in
order to survive power outages, so you can grab that if you really need it).
It's actually hard to see what purpose this "encryption" is serving (the
vendors studiously avoid providing a threat model), it doesn't protect live
data, it barely protects data at rest (say if you decide to Fedex the contents
of your data centre across town), the only thing it really does is allow for
fast erasure of contents, and protect against casual snooping of the "buy a
batch of drives on ebay and see what's on them" kind.
So I guess if ebay is your threat, it's good enough.  OTOH a BIOS password set
for the drive will do the same thing.
As a more general response to "what's the point", regulatory compliance ("our
drives were encrypted so we don't have to disclose the 40M credit card breach
from last week"), buzzword-compliance, CYA, it's not a bad idea from a

One saving grace about RFC 2631 was that it was pretty much universally
ignored for the reason that it was, well, a pretty stupid way to do things, so
the number of affected implementations would be approximately zero.
(I only know of one, rather minor, vendor who implemented it.  Microsoft
implemented it in receive-only mode solely so that they couldn't be accused of
being non-standards-compliant, but I'd be very surprised if there was anything
still around that supported it.  For starters you'd need to be able to find a

That just indicates support for PKCS  DH parameters, not anything else.  In
any case the page also says:
  OpenSSL currently only supports the older PKCS DH, not the newer X9.42 DH.
so that explicitly precludes using it in certs, even if code elsewhere would
support such usage.
I've gone through my (sizeable) cert collection and found a single example of
X9.42 certs, created by a USG contracting company paid to develop the code for
this and dating from 1996.  The certs are signed with a test DSA key, and
contain a number of errors (zero-length fields, the DH key is marked as a CA
signing key, etc).

You need to go back to the original source of all the DLP stuff, which is DSA
186-3 came along in June 2009, and that in turn points to SP 800-89, which has
a section 4 "Assurance of Domain Parameter Validity".  This one gets really
complicated because you can get the domain parameters from all over the place
(generated yourself, provided for you by a third party, found at the bottom of
a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door
saying 'Beware of the Leopard', ...).
So if you generate them yourself, you're OK.  If you get them from a CA then
you don't need to care because if the CA wants to attack you then they can
just issue a forged cert in your name and don't need to worry about
backdooring the params (in any case using shared params is a bad idea because
they allow forgery of signatures on certificates. Suppose that the certificate
contains a copy of the certificate signer's DSA parameters, and the verifier
of the certificate has a copy of the signer's public key but not the signer's
DSA parameters (which are shared with other keys). If the verifier uses the
DSA parameters from the certificate along with the signer's public key to
verify the signature on the certificate, then an attacker can create bogus
certificates by choosing a random u and finding its inverse v modulo q (uv is
congruent to 1 modulo q).  Then take the certificate signer's public key g^x
and compute g' = (g^x)^u. Then g'^v = g^x.  Using the DSA parameters p, q, g',
the signer's public key corresponds to the private key v, which the attacker
knows.  The attacker can then create a bogus certificate, put parameters (p,
q, g') in it, and sign it with the DSA private key v to create an apparently
valid certificate).
Finally, if you get them from the disused lavatory then you deserve everything
you get^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^HFIPS 186-3 has validation requirements that use the
optional j and seed parameters, but I've never seen them used anywhere so even
though the validation requirements exist, you can't apply them.
The real question though is, why would anyone use parameters they didn't
generate themselves?  All DSA implementations I've seen (apart from some
experimental code from the 1990s, which also encoded the j/seed values)
generate all the parameters themselves, it's not like ECDSA where everyone
ends up using some shared values that a "trusted" external party provides

Whose DH?  There are three major users of this on the public Internet, IPsec,
TLS, and SSH, all of which have the server provide the DH values.  MITM'ing
yourself isn't much of an achievement.
I haven't seen anything about this (so far) that doesn't class it as a purely
certificational weakness.  Consider the following equivalent of the flaw, but
for RSA:
  I stand up a TLS server and provision it with a cert where the server-auth
  key has exponent 1.
There is nothing in any spec that I can immediately think of that says that
you have to reject keys with e=1 (e.g. RFC 3447 just says it's "a positive
integer").  Most implementation were quite happy to accept e=1 keys until
maybe two years ago when there was some bad publicity about them which forced
vendors to fix the problem, but before that no-one bothered rejecting such
obviously invalid keys.  Use of e=1 keys was even a documented Windows
"feature" to allow plaintext key export while still being FIPS 140 compliant
This isn't any deliberately-inserted backdoor in the RFC, it's just sloppy
wording.  In any case though if I configure my server with a key I know to be
broken then any problems I encounter are my own fault.
The reductio ad absurdam form of this is that I stand up a TLS server which
serves the private key to anyone that connects to it (or puts it in the SSH
banner, or whatever).  OK, so I've proven that I can backdoor myself.  I can't
see how a third-party attacker can do anything though (for DH, RSA, or just
straight publish-the-key) unless I help them do it.

One saving grace about RFC 2631 was that it was pretty much universally

or at least any that's still around now.
The static DH parameters need to be turned into a certificate by a CA.  I

That just indicates support for PKCS  DH parameters, not anything else.  In
any case the page also says:
  OpenSSL currently only supports the older PKCS DH, not the newer X9.42 DH.
so that explicitly precludes using it in certs, even if code elsewhere would
support such usage.
I've gone through my (sizeable) cert collection and found a single example of
X9.42 certs, created by a USG contracting company paid to develop the code for
this and dating from 1996.  The certs are signed with a test DSA key, and
contain a number of errors (zero-length fields, the DH key is marked as a CA
signing key, etc).

You need to go back to the original source of all the DLP stuff, which is DSA
186-3 came along in June 2009, and that in turn points to SP 800-89, which has
a section 4 "Assurance of Domain Parameter Validity".  This one gets really
complicated because you can get the domain parameters from all over the place
(generated yourself, provided for you by a third party, found at the bottom of
a locked filing cabinet stuck in a disused lavatory with a sign on the door
saying 'Beware of the Leopard', ...).
So if you generate them yourself, you're OK.  If you get them from a CA then
you don't need to care because if the CA wants to attack you then they can
just issue a forged cert in your name and don't need to worry about
backdooring the params (in any case using shared params is a bad idea because
they allow forgery of signatures on certificates. Suppose that the certificate
contains a copy of the certificate signer's DSA parameters, and the verifier
of the certificate has a copy of the signer's public key but not the signer's
DSA parameters (which are shared with other keys). If the verifier uses the
DSA parameters from the certificate along with the signer's public key to
verify the signature on the certificate, then an attacker can create bogus
certificates by choosing a random u and finding its inverse v modulo q (uv is
congruent to 1 modulo q).  Then take the certificate signer's public key g^x
and compute g' = (g^x)^u. Then g'^v = g^x.  Using the DSA parameters p, q, g',
the signer's public key corresponds to the private key v, which the attacker
knows.  The attacker can then create a bogus certificate, put parameters (p,
q, g') in it, and sign it with the DSA private key v to create an apparently
valid certificate).
Finally, if you get them from the disused lavatory then you deserve everything
you get^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^HFIPS 186-3 has validation requirements that use the
optional j and seed parameters, but I've never seen them used anywhere so even
though the validation requirements exist, you can't apply them.
The real question though is, why would anyone use parameters they didn't
generate themselves?  All DSA implementations I've seen (apart from some
experimental code from the 1990s, which also encoded the j/seed values)
generate all the parameters themselves, it's not like ECDSA where everyone
ends up using some shared values that a "trusted" external party provides

Whose DH?  There are three major users of this on the public Internet, IPsec,
TLS, and SSH, all of which have the server provide the DH values.  MITM'ing
yourself isn't much of an achievement.
I haven't seen anything about this (so far) that doesn't class it as a purely
certificational weakness.  Consider the following equivalent of the flaw, but
for RSA:
  I stand up a TLS server and provision it with a cert where the server-auth
  key has exponent 1.
There is nothing in any spec that I can immediately think of that says that
you have to reject keys with e=1 (e.g. RFC 3447 just says it's "a positive
integer").  Most implementation were quite happy to accept e=1 keys until
maybe two years ago when there was some bad publicity about them which forced
vendors to fix the problem, but before that no-one bothered rejecting such
obviously invalid keys.  Use of e=1 keys was even a documented Windows
"feature" to allow plaintext key export while still being FIPS 140 compliant
This isn't any deliberately-inserted backdoor in the RFC, it's just sloppy
wording.  In any case though if I configure my server with a key I know to be
broken then any problems I encounter are my own fault.
The reductio ad absurdam form of this is that I stand up a TLS server which
serves the private key to anyone that connects to it (or puts it in the SSH
banner, or whatever).  OK, so I've proven that I can backdoor myself.  I can't
see how a third-party attacker can do anything though (for DH, RSA, or just
straight publish-the-key) unless I help them do it.

... which can then be reactivated by anyone who walks through the 6.022e23
security holes that come preconfigured in any "smart" TV.
... thus reducing it to a dumb TV.
(Anyone know how long a TV will run like that, without any access to the
constant stream of communication those things want to engage in?).

Since it came from talk show host Dennis Prager and not any high school
principal, it's unlikely anyone'll get fired over it.

 "guardian-dev I think a more direct lesson here is that taking a security mechanism that
consists of a bit flag used to tag a block of memory, defining any such tagged
area as secure by executive fiat, and selling it as TrustZone, is no match
for, you know, actually doing real security.  It's not like this hasn't
happened before, in 2013 Motorola cellphones got 0wned via attackers targeting
the insecure TrustZone and attacking from inside that out to the (apparently)
quite secure non-TrustZone code.

boatload of other missing defensive features, no DEP, no ASLR, executable
stack, strcpy()s all over the place, it was described at the time as a "hack
like it's 1999" attack.  As I said in the previous post, security is more than
just a fancy name and a lot of marketing, you have to actually make an effort
to make it secure.
Oh, and given that this looks like a repeat of the same flaws from three years
ago, patching your insecure code also helps.
