Granted, that's why we don't use Tor.  However, I thought I read there are only around 3,000 Tor nodes.  That's pretty wimpy.  I may be too lazy to encrypt my traffic, but I'm perfectly happy to spend some of my money supporting free speech.  I just don't want to also support griefers and leechers.
OK, so scratch out the idea of keeping internet histories.  It does sound too dangerous.  Instead, rely on the web of trust model similar to what we see in the original Ripple e-money system.  Maybe enhance it with a reputation system based on recommendations.
You're probably right.  We could instead provide controls similar to OpenDNS where access to sites may be blocked by some exit and routing nodes.  I don't think this would be a huge complication. Also, users could be rated by other users in different categories. For example, on LinkedIn, people verify that I know about FPGAs. I'm not sure if a routing policy should depend on such ratings, as it might give me some clue about who is using my router.
No worries about pessimism.  That's the natural environment new ideas live in, or in this case, probably a regurgitated old idea.
I'm a fan of the original Ripple e-money algorithm (not this new stuff designed to make the authors rich).  Users have nodes in the trust graph, and can specify that they "trust" other users up to some maximum monetary value.  Simply based on these trust relationships, an economy with e-money based on this trust is possible.  I would love to enable micro-transactions in a Ripple system, where I might pay 10 microcents for 100KB of data bandwidth (or whatever the going rate is).  I could also have my FreedomBox pay for at least it's electricity and bandwidth while hosting encrypted backups or helping people download from BitTorrent faster.  It's one thing to say "I trust that guy a lot".  It's another to say "Let him put $10 on my tab."  It forces us to put trust in terms of dollars, and that's when we find out that to one guy "absolute trust" is worth about 10 cents, while "medium trust" is worth $100 to someone else.  If a griefer attacked one of my web sites, I might place a negative trust edge against him, claiming he owes me damages for the griefing.
In terms of automated trust discovery, I'm frankly against it. We're talking anonymous people out there, and they have to earn trust.  To do that, your FreedomBox could host a web site for me, or help transfer files, or backup my data, or you could even simply pay me a few cents.  With a tit-for-tat algorithm, I would trust you back, plus a little extra, over time.  So if we've done $100 in business in the past, I might be willing to lend you $1, no questions asked.  If there are other reasons I want to trust you, for example if we've exchanged e-mails and I've become convinced we share certain goals, then I could manually increase the trust value.
An adversary would have great difficulty scamming people and taking their money in a Ripple network.  The protocol has been running live for years, and I wont go into the details, but it's a hardy algorithm.  However, an adversary who just wants to know our true identities could gain useful insights by analyzing the trust graph. People who trust each other more are more likely to be electrically close to each other, and when people manually set a trust relationship, you can assume they have somehow interacted.  If an adversary takes some step like giving a lot of money to a terrorist group, then they might identify members of that group based on who increases their trust relationship afterwards.
However, I've seen these same arguments made against BitCoin, and an adversary with a lot of nodes in the Tor network (like the NSA) might be able to determine identities based on packet timing. Overall, I suspect we may be able to do a better job promoting freedom if we were to build such a network.
