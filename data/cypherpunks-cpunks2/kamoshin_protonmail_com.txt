Hey Everyone,
It has come to my attention that there are people trying to impersonate me. Trying to claim Bitcoins promised to me years ago which I left to a community member for safe keeping. I do not fully recall who'm I interacted with back in the 2000's as my memory is poor. Though lately for some reason being around exactly 10 years ago I am recalling some interactions. So if what I describe reminds you of a conversation please email me. As I do not wish to risk my property getting in bad hands. I have everything I need to prove my claim. I have recalled a lot of things regarding the early days of Bitcoin which are not public knowledge. Ask me anything? I can as well if need be agree to an in person meeting if it is required to prove my claim. Though I would rather keep my anonymity unless the community really wants me to become more public. I could see myself as a more open figure like the rest of the blockchain community & developers as the times have changed since the 2000's. In 10 years Bitcoin has gotten a lot more mainstream and we are ready to move forward to the next level of implementation. I have a few ideas ;)
Best, Kamoshi Natosato
