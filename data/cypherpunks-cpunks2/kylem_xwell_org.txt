Is that not self-explanatory after everything that happened in the
federal government this month?

So how do you propose that a provider perform SSL without keeping
their private cert? And how should they respond when a court *orders*
them to allow law enforcement or other agencies to install sniffers on
their network? That's essentially what Lavabit faced.
Also: it's easy to accuse someone of lacking guts or imagination, but
I don't think any of these folks are shutting down services and even
businesses without serious consideration of the costs involved -
financial and otherwise.

Trickle connections are an interesting idea and will work for some
applications where high latency and possibly low throughput are okay.
I look forward to reading that paper.
Though re: traffic analysis, if your traffic stands out too much (i.e.
for relatively low n on a global scale), then you'll still have
issues[0]. And the devil's in the details, as Tom Ritter's fine work
around AAM[1] has shown.

@_subject: Spy Files: New WikiLeaks docs expose secretive, unruly 
The journalists (like Barton Gellman) working on the releases have
specifically stated that Snowden's not doing this. According to
Gellman[0], Snowden passed them the docs with fairly minimal
instructions ("select for news and avoid damage"). One could certainly
disbelieve Gellman, but there's the assertion nonetheless.

Fortunately it looks like they have another $90k from non-Paypal

Crypto discussion list Feels like naming coincidence, particularly given that the GCHQ
analogue is named similarly. From The Guardian[0]:
"The NSA's codeword for its decryption program, Bullrun, is taken from
a major battle of the American civil war. Its British counterpart,
Edgehill, is named after the first major engagement of the English
civil war, more than 200 years earlier."

I also suspect they're doing some level of malware screening. If so,
it didn't work too well here - not that this is malware (the author of
the original service that created these docs is a personal friend) but
it has a lot of similar code / functionality.
