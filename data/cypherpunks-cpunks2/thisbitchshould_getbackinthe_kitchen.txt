# REPLY TO PUBLIC RESPONSE AND MISREPRESENTATION
I value diversity and inclusion, am not denying that sexism exists, and
don’t endorse using stereotypes. When addressing the gap in
representation in the population, we need to look at population level
differences in distributions. If we can’t have an honest discussion
about this, then we can never truly solve the problem. Psychological
safety is built on mutual respect and acceptance, but unfortunately our
culture of shaming and misrepresentation is disrespectful and
unaccepting of anyone outside its echo chamber. Despite what the public
response seems to have been, I’ve gotten many personal messages from
fellow Googlers expressing their gratitude for bringing up these very
important issues which they agree with but would never have the courage
to say or defend because of our shaming culture and the possibility of
being fired. This needs to change.

psychological safety.
are too sacred to be honestly discussed.
elements of this ideology.
part explain why we don’t have 50% representation of women in tech and
leadership. Discrimination to reach equal representation is unfair,
divisive, and bad for business.
# BACKGROUND [1]
People generally have good intentions, but we all have biases which are
invisible to us. Thankfully, open and honest discussion with those who
disagree can highlight our blind spots and help us grow, which is why I
wrote this document.[2] Google has several biases and honest discussion
about these biases is being silenced by the dominant ideology. What
follows is by no means the complete story, but it’s a perspective that
desperately needs to be told at Google.
Google’s biases:
At Google, we talk so much about unconscious bias as it applies to race
and gender, but we rarely discuss our moral biases. Political
orientation is actually a result of deep moral preferences and thus
biases. Considering that the overwhelming majority of the social
sciences, media, and Google lean left, we should critically examine
these prejudices.
Left Biases:
Right Biases:
Neither side is 100% correct and both viewpoints are necessary for a
functioning society or, in this case, company. A company too far to the
right may be slow to react, overly hierarchical, and untrusting of
others. In contrast, a company too far to the left will constantly be
changing (deprecating much loved services), over diversify its interests
(ignoring or being ashamed of its core business), and overly trust its
employees and competitors.
Only facts and reason can shed light on these biases, but when it comes
to diversity and inclusion, Google’s left bias has created a politically
correct monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into
silence. This silence removes any checks against encroaching extremist
and authoritarian policies. For the rest of this document, I’ll
concentrate on the extreme stance that all differences in outcome are
due to differential treatment and the authoritarian element that’s
required to actually discriminate to create equal representation.
# POSSIBLE NON-BIAS CAUSES IN THE GENDER GAP IN TECH [3]
At Google, we’re regularly told that implicit (unconscious) and explicit
biases are holding women back in tech and leadership. Of course, men and
women experience bias, tech, and the workplace differently and we should
be cognizant of this, but it’s far from the whole story.
On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways. These
differences aren’t just socially constructed because:
often still identify and act like males
Note, I’m not saying that all men differ from women in the following
ways or that these differences are “just.” I’m simply stating that the
distribution of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in
part due to biological causes and that these differences may explain why
we don’t see equal representation of women in tech and leadership. Many
of these differences are small and there’s significant overlap between
men and women, so you can’t say anything about an individual given these
population level distributions.
# PERSONALITY DIFFERENCES
Women, on average, have more:
Women generally also have a stronger interest in people rather than
things, relative to men (also interpreted as empathizing vs. systemizing).
in social or artistic areas. More men may like coding because it
requires systemizing and even within SWEs, comparatively more women work
on front end, which deals with both people and aesthetics.
Also, higher agreeableness.
asking for raises, speaking up, and leading. Note that these are just
average differences and there’s overlap between men and women, but this
is seen solely as a women’s issue. This leads to exclusory programs like
Stretch and swaths of men without support.
contribute to the higher levels of anxiety women report on Googlegeist
and to the lower number of women in high stress jobs.
Note that contrary to what a social constructionist would argue,
research suggests that “greater nation-level gender equality leads to
psychological dissimilarity in men’s and women’s personality traits.”
Because as “society becomes more prosperous and more egalitarian, innate
dispositional differences between men and women have more space to
develop and the gap that exists between men and women in their
personality becomes wider.” We need to stop assuming that gender gaps
imply sexism.
# MEN'S HIGHER DRIVE FOR STATUS
We always ask why we don’t see women in top leadership positions, but we
never ask why we see so many men in these jobs. These positions often
require long, stressful hours that may not be worth it if you want a
balanced and fulfilling life.
Status is the primary metric that men are judged on[4], pushing many men
into these higher paying, less satisfying jobs for the status that they
entail. Note, the same forces that lead men into high pay/high stress
jobs in tech and leadership cause men to take undesirable and dangerous
jobs like coal mining, garbage collection, and firefighting, and suffer
93% of work-related deaths.
# NON-DISCRIMINATORY WAYS TO REDUCE THE GENDER GAP
Below I’ll go over some of the differences in distribution of traits
between men and women that I outlined in the previous section and
suggest ways to address them to increase women’s representation in tech
and without resorting to discrimination.
Google is already making strides in many of these areas, but I think
it’s still instructive to list them:
programming and more collaboration. Unfortunately, there may be limits
to how people-oriented certain roles and Google can be and we shouldn’t
deceive ourselves or students into thinking otherwise (some of our
programs to get female students into coding might be doing this).
to Perf may be doing this to an extent, but maybe there’s more we can
do. This doesn’t mean that we should remove all competitiveness from
Google. Competitiveness and self reliance can be valuable traits and we
shouldn’t necessarily disadvantage those that have them, like what’s
been done in education. Women on average are more prone to anxiety. Make
tech and leadership less stressful. Google already partly does this with
its many stress reduction courses and benefits.
higher drive for status on average
lucrative careers, men may disproportionately want to be in them.
Allowing and truly endorsing (as part of our culture) part time work
though can keep more women in tech.
gender role, but men are still very much tied to the male gender role.
If we, as a society, allow men to be more “feminine,” then the gender
gap will shrink, although probably because men will leave tech and
leadership for traditionally feminine roles.
Philosophically, I don’t think we should do arbitrary social engineering
of tech just to make it appealing to equal portions of both men and
women. For each of these changes, we need principles reasons for why it
helps Google; that is, we should be optimizing for Google—with Google’s
diversity being a component of that. For example currently those trying
to work extra hours or take extra stress will inevitably get ahead and
if we try to change that too much, it may have disastrous consequences.
Also, when considering the costs and benefits, we should keep in mind
that Google’s funding is finite so its allocation is more zero-sum than
is generally acknowledged.
# THE HARM OF GOOGLE'S BIASES
I strongly believe in gender and racial diversity, and I think we should
strive for more. However, to achieve a more equal gender and race
representation, Google has created several discriminatory practices:
or race [5]
candidates by decreasing the false negative rate
showing that same scrutiny in the reverse direction (clear confirmation
incentivize illegal discrimination [6]
These practices are based on false assumptions generated by our biases
and can actually increase race and gender tensions. We’re told by senior
leadership that what we’re doing is both the morally and economically
correct thing to do, but without evidence this is just veiled left
ideology[7] that can irreparably harm Google.****
# WHY WE'RE BLIND
We all have biases and use motivated reasoning to dismiss ideas that run
counter to our internal values. Just as some on the Right deny science
that runs counter to the “God > humans > environment” hierarchy (e.g.,
evolution and climate change) the Left tends to deny science concerning
biological differences between people (e.g., IQ[8] and sex differences).
Thankfully, climate scientists and evolutionary biologists generally
aren’t on the right. Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of
humanities and social scientists learn left (about 95%), which creates
enormous confirmation bias, changes what’s being studied, and maintains
myths like social constructionism and the gender wage gap[9]. Google’s
left leaning makes us blind to this bias and uncritical of its results,
which we’re using to justify highly politicized programs.
In addition to the Left’s affinity for those it sees as weak, humans are
generally biased towards protecting females. As mentioned before, this
likely evolved because males are biologically disposable and because
women are generally more cooperative and areeable than men. We have
extensive government and Google programs, fields of study, and legal and
social norms to protect women, but when a man complains about a gender
issue issue [sic] affecting men, he’s labelled as a misogynist and
whiner[10]. Nearly every difference between men and women is interpreted
as a form of women’s oppression. As with many things in life, gender
differences are often a case of “grass being greener on the other side”;
unfortunately, taxpayer and Google money is spent to water only one side
of the lawn.
The same compassion for those seen as weak creates political
correctness[11], which constrains discourse and is complacent to the
extremely sensitive PC-authoritarians that use violence and shaming to
advance their cause. While Google hasn’t harbored the violent leftists
protests that we’re seeing at universities, the frequent shaming in TGIF
and in our culture has created the same silence, psychologically unsafe
# SUGGESTIONS
I hope it’s clear that I’m not saying that diversity is bad, that Google
or society is 100% fair, that we shouldn’t try to correct for existing
biases, or that minorities have the same experience of those in the
majority. My larger point is that we have an intolerance for ideas and
evidence that don’t fit a certain ideology. I’m also not saying that we
should restrict people to certain gender roles; I’m advocating for quite
the opposite: treat people as individuals, not as just another member of
their group (tribalism).
My concrete suggestions are to:
01. De-moralize Diversity:
terms of costs and benefits, dismiss anyone that disagrees as immoral,
and harshly punish those we see as villains to protect the “victims.”
02. Stop Alienating Conservatives:
and political orientation is one of the most fundamental and significant
ways in which people view things differently.
feel like they need to stay in the closet to avoid open hostility. We
should empower those with different ideologies to be able to express
business because conservatives tend to be higher in conscientiousness,
which is require for much of the drudgery and maintenance work
characteristic of a mature company.
03. Confront Google’s Biases:
diversity and inclusion, but our moral biases are farther reaching than
orientation and personality to give a fuller picture into how our biases
are affecting our culture.
04. Stop Restricting Programs and Classes to Certain Genders or Races:
focus on some of the non-discriminatory practices I outlined.
05. Have an Open and Honest Discussion About the Costs and Benefits of
our Diversity Programs:
as misguided and biased as mandating increases for women’s
representation in the homeless, work-related and violent deaths,
prisons, and school dropouts.
diversity programs which keeps it immune to criticism from those outside
its ideological echo chamber.
government accusations of discrimination, but that can easily backfire
since they incentivize illegal discrimination.
06. Focus on Psychological Safety, Not Just Race/Gender Diversity:
effects and should (hopefully) not lead to unfair discrimination.
testing our products, but the benefits are less clear for those more
removed from UX.
07. De-emphasize Empathy:
While I strongly support trying to understand how and why people think
the way they do, relying on affective empathy—feeling another’s
pain—causes us to focus on anecdotes, favor individuals similar to us,
and harbor other irrational and dangerous biases. Being emotionally
unengaged helps us better reason about the facts.
08. Prioritize Intention:
increases our sensitivity, which is not universally positive:
sensitivity increases both our tendency to take offense and our self
censorship, leading to authoritarian policies. Speaking up without the
fear of being harshly judged is central to psychological safety, but
these practices can remove that safety by judging unintentional
with violence and isn’t backed by evidence.
09. Be Open About the Science of Human Nature:
or due to discrimination, we open our eyes to a more accurate view of
the human condition which is necessary if we actually want to solve

# FOOTNOTES
[1] This document is mostly written from the perspective of Google’s
Mountain View campus, I can’t speak about other offices or countries.
[2] Of course, I may be biased and only see evidence that supports my
viewpoint. In terms of political biases, I consider myself a classical
liberal and strongly value individualism and reason. I’d be very happy
to discuss any of the document further and provide more citations.
[3] Throughout the document, by “tech”, I mostly mean software engineering.
[4] For heterosexual romantic relationships, men are more strongly
judged by status and women by beauty. Again, this has biological origins
and is culturally universal.
[5] Stretch, BOLD, CSSI, Engineering Practicum (to an extent), and
several other Google funded internal and external programs are for
people with a certain gender or race.
[6] Instead set Googlegeist OKRs, potentially for certain demographics.
We can increase representation at an org level by either making it a
better environment for certain groups (which would be seen in survey
scores) or discriminating based on a protected status (which is illegal
and I’ve seen it done). Increased representation OKRs can incentivize
the latter and create zero-sum struggles between orgs.
[7] Communism promised to be both morally and economically superior to
capitalism, but every attempt became morally corrupt and an economic
failure. As it became clear that the working class of the liberal
democracies wasn’t going to overthrow their “capitalist oppressors,” the
Marxist intellectuals transitioned from class warfare to gender and race
politics. The core oppressor-oppressed dynamics remained, but now the
oppressor is the “white, straight, cis-gendered patriarchy.”
[8] Ironically, IQ tests were initially championed by the Left when
meritocracy meant helping the victims of the aristocracy.
[9] Yes, in a national aggretavistock, women have lower salaries than
men for a variety of reasons. For the same work though, women get paid
just as much as men. Considering women spend more money than men and
that salary represents how much the employees sacrifices (e.g. more
hours, stress, and danger), we really need to rethink our stereotypes
around power.
[10] “The traditionalist system of gender does not deal well with the
idea of men needing support. Men are expected to be strong, to not
complain, and to deal with problems on their own. Men’s problems are
more often seen as personal failings rather than victimhood,, due to our
gendered idea of agency. This discourages men from bringing attention to
their issues (whether individual or group-wide issues), for fear of
being seen as whiners, complainers, or weak.”
[11] Political correctness is defined as “the avoidance of forms of
expression or action that are perceived to exclude, marginalize, or
insult groups of people who are socially disadvantaged or discriminated
against,” which makes it clear why it’s a phenomenon of the Left and a
tool of authoritarians.

We have a response and the cancer cannot be contained.  Pics related.
Update 7:25pm ET:
Google’s new Vice President of Diversity, Integrity & Governance,
Danielle Brown, issued the following statement in response to the
internal employee memo:
I’m Danielle, Google’s brand new VP of Diversity, Integrity &
Governance. I started just a couple of weeks ago, and I had hoped to
take another week or so to get the lay of the land before introducing
myself to you all. But given the heated debate we’ve seen over the past
few days, I feel compelled to say a few words.
Many of you have read an internal document shared by someone in our
engineering organization, expressing views on the natural abilities and
characteristics of different genders, as well as whether one can speak
freely of these things at Google. And like many of you, I found that it
advanced incorrect assumptions about gender. I’m not going to link to it
here as it’s not a viewpoint that I or this company endorses, promotes
or encourages.
Diversity and inclusion are a fundamental part of our values and the
culture we continue to cultivate. We are unequivocal in our belief that
diversity and inclusion are critical to our success as a company, and
we’ll continue to stand for that and be committed to it for the long
haul. As Ari Balogh said in his internal G+ post, “Building an open,
inclusive environment is core to who we are, and the right thing to do.
‘Nuff said. “
Google has taken a strong stand on this issue, by releasing its
demographic data and creating a company wide OKR on diversity and
inclusion. Strong stands elicit strong reactions. Changing a culture is
hard, and it’s often uncomfortable. But I firmly believe Google is doing
the right thing, and that’s why I took this job.
Part of building an open, inclusive environment means fostering a
culture in which those with alternative views, including different
political views, feel safe sharing their opinions. But that discourse
needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment found in our
Code of Conduct, policies, and anti-discrimination laws.
I’ve been in the industry for a long time, and I can tell you that I’ve
never worked at a company that has so many platforms for employees to
express themselves—TGIF, Memegen, internal G+, thousands of discussion
groups. I know this conversation doesn’t end with my email today. I look
forward to continuing to hear your thoughts as I settle in and meet with
Googlers across the company.

# FOOTNOTES
[1] This document is mostly written from the perspective of Google’s
Mountain View campus, I can’t speak about other offices or countries.
[2] Of course, I may be biased and only see evidence that supports my
viewpoint. In terms of political biases, I consider myself a classical
liberal and strongly value individualism and reason. I’d be very happy
to discuss any of the document further and provide more citations.
[3] Throughout the document, by “tech”, I mostly mean software engineering.
[4] For heterosexual romantic relationships, men are more strongly
judged by status and women by beauty. Again, this has biological origins
and is culturally universal.
[5] Stretch, BOLD, CSSI, Engineering Practicum (to an extent), and
several other Google funded internal and external programs are for
people with a certain gender or race.
[6] Instead set Googlegeist OKRs, potentially for certain demographics.
We can increase representation at an org level by either making it a
better environment for certain groups (which would be seen in survey
scores) or discriminating based on a protected status (which is illegal
and I’ve seen it done). Increased representation OKRs can incentivize
the latter and create zero-sum struggles between orgs.
[7] Communism promised to be both morally and economically superior to
capitalism, but every attempt became morally corrupt and an economic
failure. As it became clear that the working class of the liberal
democracies wasn’t going to overthrow their “capitalist oppressors,” the
Marxist intellectuals transitioned from class warfare to gender and race
politics. The core oppressor-oppressed dynamics remained, but now the
oppressor is the “white, straight, cis-gendered patriarchy.”
[8] Ironically, IQ tests were initially championed by the Left when
meritocracy meant helping the victims of the aristocracy.
[9] Yes, in a national aggretavistock, women have lower salaries than
men for a variety of reasons. For the same work though, women get paid
just as much as men. Considering women spend more money than men and
that salary represents how much the employees sacrifices (e.g. more
hours, stress, and danger), we really need to rethink our stereotypes
around power.
[10] “The traditionalist system of gender does not deal well with the
idea of men needing support. Men are expected to be strong, to not
complain, and to deal with problems on their own. Men’s problems are
more often seen as personal failings rather than victimhood,, due to our
gendered idea of agency. This discourages men from bringing attention to
their issues (whether individual or group-wide issues), for fear of
being seen as whiners, complainers, or weak.”
[11] Political correctness is defined as “the avoidance of forms of
expression or action that are perceived to exclude, marginalize, or
insult groups of people who are socially disadvantaged or discriminated
against,” which makes it clear why it’s a phenomenon of the Left and a
tool of authoritarians.

Update 7:25pm ET:
Google’s new Vice President of Diversity, Integrity & Governance,
Danielle Brown, issued the following statement in response to the
internal employee memo:
I’m Danielle, Google’s brand new VP of Diversity, Integrity &
Governance. I started just a couple of weeks ago, and I had hoped to
take another week or so to get the lay of the land before introducing
myself to you all. But given the heated debate we’ve seen over the past
few days, I feel compelled to say a few words.
Many of you have read an internal document shared by someone in our
engineering organization, expressing views on the natural abilities and
characteristics of different genders, as well as whether one can speak
freely of these things at Google. And like many of you, I found that it
advanced incorrect assumptions about gender. I’m not going to link to it
here as it’s not a viewpoint that I or this company endorses, promotes
or encourages.
Diversity and inclusion are a fundamental part of our values and the
culture we continue to cultivate. We are unequivocal in our belief that
diversity and inclusion are critical to our success as a company, and
we’ll continue to stand for that and be committed to it for the long
haul. As Ari Balogh said in his internal G+ post, “Building an open,
inclusive environment is core to who we are, and the right thing to do.
‘Nuff said. “
Google has taken a strong stand on this issue, by releasing its
demographic data and creating a company wide OKR on diversity and
inclusion. Strong stands elicit strong reactions. Changing a culture is
hard, and it’s often uncomfortable. But I firmly believe Google is doing
the right thing, and that’s why I took this job.
Part of building an open, inclusive environment means fostering a
culture in which those with alternative views, including different
political views, feel safe sharing their opinions. But that discourse
needs to work alongside the principles of equal employment found in our
Code of Conduct, policies, and anti-discrimination laws.
I’ve been in the industry for a long time, and I can tell you that I’ve
never worked at a company that has so many platforms for employees to
express themselves—TGIF, Memegen, internal G+, thousands of discussion
groups. I know this conversation doesn’t end with my email today. I look
forward to continuing to hear your thoughts as I settle in and meet with
Googlers across the company.
