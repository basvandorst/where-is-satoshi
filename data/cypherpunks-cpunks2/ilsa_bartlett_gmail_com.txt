@_subject: Aaron Swartz - the real reason he was murdered 
I did not click on the link and just never would. I stood next to Aaron's
brother in a hackathon in honor of The Work.
The Work touches my heart.
I wear my Grace Host shirt proudly. Any person can kick dust in the road
and hope it mixes with some s*%t of the shit kicker and get traction... and
lookie ..Is this success? Where any attention, either good or bad, is worth
the bucket.
I am pulling for the next Aaron kind of guy with a great vision steps
forward fearlessly to lead all us wanna bees forward in the foot steps of
dear dear gentle Aaron and his kind gentle family and friends.
smile, Ruby

@_subject: Remember, remember the Fukushima nuclear disaster on this day? 
I rather read then post. Today I wish to share the Japan's Nuclear Trauma,
as the leaks continue unabated, on it's Fifth Birthday.
  Georgi,  Thank you for posting, your comment is so true...
  Tomorrow just after 2:00, Five Years Ago was the 9.2 Earth Quake in Japan.
  1800 + people died instantly. Our world is still awash with radio active
  waste still out flowing toward the west coast of the United States in all
  water around our globe.
  A Journey In Disaster. This is a Warning To The World!
    <
  I ask you not to forget how the corporation Teco lied.
    <
  Japan has enough bomb quality plutonium to make more than 400 hydrogen
bombs over the number they already have as test examples for how to build a
better killing bomb.

@_subject: Current State of Mailing Lists / Forums about Internet Freedom, 
Please Know that I Care ..I have NO computer skills that I did not copy or
follow Anthony P. Though he is gone I hope to get to know those who would
bother with a Green Horn... I wanted you to know I stand With the freedom
loving service especially as the tracks are going in as everything is
dependent on levels of the global code dances and where important stories
are given time to develop.  I once had just One Date with a tall handsome
security dud who told me, his face so close to my nose, that I could feel
the warmth of his breath, " I did a full search to see if you were real".
Imagine what I was thinking as I slide back in my chair and lifted my
single malt small island scotch.
I might not have computer language skills but I am one of you.  I never
spoke up before but doing this is part of my grieving process. If there is
a true kind person who might give me a helping hand with my privacy needs,
find a way to let me know.
I just wanted to say ...Happy season of the  time to rest and party no
matter what your core stories are, I am so glad You Are All Here and I have
been lucky to read and sometimes act on what you are talking about... yea,
run on sentence...
Have any of y'all written a book?  I am working on an autobiography, anyone
know good editors or agents and so forth?
Somewhere beyond a dream, with..
Respect and Gratitude, Smile
