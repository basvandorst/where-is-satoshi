@_subject: Can I work on a website from 2 computers w/ the same server? 
Hi, I have two computers, an old Windows 3.1  and new Windows 98. (Both use Earthlink.) I built my website on W3.1 with Navigator Gold (without HTML)-- what you see is what you get and like working from there. However in bringing up website on W98-- spacing is dif.  I would like to put the Navigator Gold onto W98 and work on the Website from there-- could download more pix etc. and other machine is getting creaky. (Still not sure about accessing the FTP from W98.)  Any problems you foresee-- or is it possible to work on the website from TWO computers with same server?
Thanks for any helpful information.  Ludmilla Bollow  -  bollow at earthlink.net
