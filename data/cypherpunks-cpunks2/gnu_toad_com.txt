Internet Systems Consortium (ISC) is delighted to announce the
  launch of the Open Home Gateway Forum with an initial grant from
  Comcast. The OHGF is a Forum of ISPs and vendors and Internet
  development organizations, initiated and spearheaded by ISC, that
  aims to improve the rollout of new Internet technologies to home
  networks by providing stable, quality-assured reference Open Source
  software to be used in home gateways. Home gateways are the means by
  which a residential customer connects to an Internet service
  provider.
ISC is serious folks, who have maintained the core DNS implementation
for decades and who run the "F" root server.

@_subject: [Cryptography] System level security in "low end" environments 
Such environments are getting very rare these days.  For example, an
electrical engineer friend of mine was recently working on designing a
cheap aimable mirror, to be deployed by the thousands to aim sunlight
at a collector.  He discovered that connectors and wires are more
expensive than processor chips these days!  So he ended up deciding to
use a system-on-chip with a built-in radio that eliminated the need to
have a connector or a wire to each mirror.  (You can print the antenna
on the same printed circuit board that holds the chip and the
What dogs the security of our systems these days is *complexity*.  We
don't have great security primitives to just drop into place.  And the
ones we do have, have complicated tradeoffs that come to the fore
depending on how we compound them with other design elements (like
RNGs, protocols, radios, clocks, power supplies, threat models, etc).
This is invariant whether the system is "low end" or "high end".
That radio controlled mirror can be taken over by a drive-by attacker
in a way that would take a lot more physical labor to mess up a
wire-controlled one.  And if the attack aimed two hundred mirrors at
something flammable, the attacker could easily start a dangerous fire
instead of making cheap solar energy.  (Denial of service is even
easier - just aim the mirrors in random directions and the power goes
away.  Then what security systems elsewhere were depending on that
power?  This might just be one cog in a larger attack.)  Some of the
security elements are entirely external to the design.  For example,
is the radio protocol one that's built into laptops by default, like
wifi or bluetooth?  Or into smartphones?  Or does it require custom
hardware?  If not, a teenager can more easily attack the mirrors --
and a corrupt government can infect millions of laptops and phones
with malware that will attack mirror arrays that they come near to.
For products that never get made in the millions, the design cost
(salaries and time) is a significant fraction of the final cost per
unit.  Therefore everybody designs unencrypted and unauthenticated
stuff, just because it's easy and predictable.
For example it's pretty easy to make the system-on-chip above send or
receive raw frames on the radio.  Harder to get it to send or receive
UDP packets (now it needs an IP address, ARP, DHCP, more storage, ...).
Much harder to get it to send or receive *authenticated* frames or UDP
packets (now it needs credentials; is it two-way authenticated, if so
it needs a way to be introduced to its system, etc).  Much harder
again to get it to send or receive *encrypted* frames or UDP packets
(now it needs keys too, and probably more state to avoid replays,
etc).  And how many EE's who could debug the simple frame sending
firmware and hardware, can debug a crypto protocol they've just
implemented (even making the dubious assumpion that they compounded
the elements in a secure way and have just made a few stupid coding

Peter Saint-Andre What else is on your LAN besides a network switch?  Do you have a
printer with an Ethernet jack?  Or a DSL modem?  Or a cable modem?  Or
a low-end commercial NAS box?  All of these typically run an embedded
system using some old version of Linux, and never get their firmware
updated to close zero-day security holes.  If one of them can be taken
over, and can convince your network switch to send them all the
packets (perhaps by ARP flooding or ARP spoofing), then that embedded
system can wiretap any LAN transaction it likes.  Many DSL modems contain a small switch, which if it's the only switch
in a small home or office network, would make all packets among local
nodes accessible to malware running in that DSL modem.
Many cheap Ethernet switches are 'intelligent' meaning that they have
an embedded processor that offers a Web configuration interface.
Such devices are fertile malware targets.
Automated global-scale attacks against such embedded systems are
certainly feasible.  Could the injected code be sufficiently subtle to
detect and store or report entropy events like packet timing, without
becoming sufficiently obvious that the malware's presence is detected
on the network?
PS: On the "big iron" rather than "small network" end of things, don't
forget virtual machines, in which a compromised VM hypervisor has full
access to all the packets (and to many other aspects of the machines
running under it).

@_subject: [Cryptography] DSL modems - how would we detect wholesale 
And most DSL modems are provided by your giant telco DSL provider --
such as AT&T -- which we already know has a long history of covertly
sucking up to NSA.  Besides their longstanding cooperation on domestic
and foreign fiber taps, they also produced the first-and-only Clipper
Chip subverted "telephone security device" for making voice calls that
"nobody but NSA" could listen to.  How hard would it be, really, for
them to subvert all their DSL modems to wiretap your LAN?
And how would you know if they had done so?  It's so convenient that
all AT&T DSL modems have a high bandwidth upstream connection to
AT&T's central office switches.  And even better that consumers have
no idea what packets are going up and down over that DSL signalling,
because they have no equipment for monitoring raw 2-wire DSL lines
(the way they could fairly easily detect inappropriate packets
traveling on an Ethernet, with a little free software and a little
replugging of Ethernet equipment).
Your DSL modem could be doing its main job (carrying your external
Internet traffic) using whatever fraction of the available bandwith
that requires in each millisecond, and using any spare capacity on the
DSL wire to mirror a select fraction, or all, of your local LAN
traffic up to the central office switch.  The switch would nominally
discard this 'filler traffic' -- but AT&T would be able to copy it to
NSA upon request, either by individual targeting of particular
customers, or wholesale.  In the better subverted DSL modems, the
filler/tap traffic would be fully encrypted between the modem and the
switch, so that even if you got professional equipment for monitoring
the DSL wire back to the central office, all you would see is 'random'
filler packets all the time.
Suppose AT&T and NSA really had no interest in doing this to you --
unlikely, I know -- but the Chinese manufacturers of DSL modems did
have such an interest?  The threat model is very similar, except the
Chinese would have to subvert the AT&T central office switches
covertly, without AT&T's willing cooperation, to extract your LAN
traffic from them.
You can guard against this threat by only plugging one Ethernet jack
into your DSL modem, and having that lead directly to a Linux or BSD
gateway box that is under your own control.  That way, the DSL modem
has no physical access to the rest of your LAN, and you can monitor
the upstream Ethernet to make sure that the only packets going to the
DSL modem are those that you intended to go upstream.
