'Coolest Monkey in the Jungle', amirite ?

Lol but for real tho.
The artist did a matte painting in photoshop, using the fucking clone
stamp tool, to forever portray the first Halfrican President of the
United States.
Mr. Obama should have this shit repainted by an actual artist, not
some third-year art school student.
The "painting" is so bad that wikipedia is censoring it, and four
other presidential portraits, citing 'Public Domain Issues'.
Second [pic related] proves they are full of shit.
