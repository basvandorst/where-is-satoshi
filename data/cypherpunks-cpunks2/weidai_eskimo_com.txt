Now that I've just spent some time compiling and playing with Matt's ESM
program, it seems almost perfectly suited for prototyping Pipe-Net since you can use it to do nested encryption.  All that's needed is to hack it so that it implements link encryption (i.e., send a
constant stream of random data in between keypresses).
This is what the user would do: (LESM for Link Encrypted Session Manager)
lesm -l
lesm -l
login to server 1
lesm -s
lesm -l (or better yet take over a free LESM session already running
login to server 2
lesm -s
lesm -s
I wonder if Matt has the time and interest do this...  If not then I guess I can try, but I've never done real crypto programming before...

I'm not sure I understand the first question.  My idea was originally based on link encrypted streams.  How can forwarding variable length packets help untracibility?  Wouldn't an attacker just have to match up the sizes of incoming and outgoing packets?  Forwarding fixed length packets, on the other hands, just makes the system a remailer-net (so you'll have to do mixing, etc.).  What am I misunderstanding here?
I just finished hacking ESM to do link encryption.  (see my other post)  Now if someone is willing to run a MUD type program and hook LESM up with it, then we'd have the first prototype of a Wei Dai

It seems to me that if a user maintains a 24-hour a day pipe to an uncompromised server, then the method I described earlier against remailers should not work against that user.  Otherwise, some kind of in-out statistical analysis may work.
See Verner Vinge's _True Names_ for a fictional description of a future where real time anonymous interactions are possible.
This is certainly true.  The system Vinge describes is almost a pipe-net.  But he didn't say anything about link encryption, without which the system can be trivially broken.
I haven't responded to the comments you made about the similarity between pipe-net and ATM, mostly because I'm not very familiar with ATM.  But as I understand it, ATM is based on forwarding fixed length cells, whereas pipe-net is based on fixed-bandwidth link encrypted streams.
Spamming, and flow control shouldn't be problems, since all users of a server will connect to it with pipes of the same bandwidth, so it can just accept a certain number and then stop.
Bandwidth limitations will depend on how fast the server CPU can do the encryption and decryption.  With LESM at 100 cps, each connection took 2% of the CPU capacity of a Sun 4-CPU(90Hz) 4/670MP.  Of course, I made no consideration for efficiency when I hacked ESM, so this can probably be decreased quite a bit.
