Let me know if you need any technical help. I will be glad to help out.
Also, if any donations for the server is required, perhaps (at least I
would) we all would be able to help a bit.

No biggie! We are already discussing how we will manage this transition.

@_subject: New Firefox/TorBrowser 0day in the wild 
"This is an Javascript exploit actively used against TorBrowser NOW. It
consists of one HTML and one CSS file, both pasted below and also
de-obscured. The exact functionality is unknown but it's getting access to
"VirtualAlloc" in "kernel32.dll" and goes from there. Please fix ASAP. I
had to break the "thecode" line in two in order to post, remove ' + ' in
the middle to restore it."

I guess not, I am not sure, but it looks like it's a Windows only
exploit. Wait for Firefox to release an update and prevent using Firefox
for any activity meanwhile.

@_subject: FreeBSD 11.0 Released 
Is anyone here using FreeBSD? I started using OpenBSD for my personal
computer and I am quite impressed. Why would anyone choose FreebSD over
OpenBSD? Number of packages available?
Also, what's the deal with HardnedBSD[1]? Anyone used it? Any good

@_subject: FreeBSD 11.0 Released 
As I am still trying to understand OpenBSDs core, is there a main reason
I should check out FreeBSD (except the reasons you pointed out)? How is
the default security on FreeBSD? I've read it somewhere something like:
"FreeBSD devs don't really care much about security as much as they should"
How true is this statement?
1. How does FreeBSD handle ASLR? If any, does it use SEGVGUARD?
2. How easy can I sandbox software? Using jails only?
3. How about W^X?
4. Trusted Path Execution?

Thanks Tom, I will look into it more and perhaps give it a try. OpenBSD
has lots of packages, but unfortunately not the ones I really need.
Looks really promising. Doing something like this automatically on the
Linux Kernel + monkey patching, would probably break in the first try.
Same goes with the Gentoo port system.
