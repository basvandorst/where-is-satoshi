@_subject: [tor-talk] USB Sticks for TAILS 
I know there is a dedicated mailinglist for TAILS, but I figured I would
reach a larger audience here, and it might be of interest to many who
are not subscribed to the TAILS list.
Ideally, you use TAILS from a read-only medium. CD is best, but many
devices these days don't have an optical drive, and handling CDs is not
as convenient as a USB stick.
For quite some time, people kept recommending the TrekStor CS USB stick
[  ], one of the
few sticks available in Germany with write-protection switch. Turns out
they use a new firmware, and now don't support booting from it in
read-only mode. The company confirmed this via email.
There are roughly no alternatives, and I figured I'm not the only one
looking for USB sticks with write protection switch. Via alibaba.com, a
"wholesale Chinese ebay", I contacted various Chinese suppliers, and
ended up ordering two samples. Even there, the selection of sticks with
write protection is very limited.
I ended up paying paying 60€ for the 2 samples because of shipping and
Western Union fees.
The sticks are not very fast, but acceptable, and boot in read-only
mode. They are not as slim as I hoped for, but the supplier is friendly,
production and shipping was very fast. (less than 2 weeks altogether).
Logo printing is cheap ($0.15 per stick), so to try the quality I also
had them print a logo on the samples.
I am still undecided whether I want the final sticks to have a logo, or
simply be blank to not attract too much attention. If you have a nice
idea for a logo, let me know. I want to order 100 sticks in time for
Chaos Communication Congress 30C3. The production cost is $4 per stick
(8GB), the final price (taxes, GEMA, shipping) will likely be around $15.

@_subject: [liberationtech] A Public Statement Regarding Ubiquitous Encryption 
Reply-To: Jabber/XMPP software development list Almost 15 years have passed since my friend Jeremie Miller released
the initial version of the jabberd IM server, launching the Jabber
open-source community and the technology we know today as XMPP. Yet,
all that time, hop-by-hop encryption using SSL/TLS has been optional
on the XMPP network. A number of server operators and software
developers in the XMPP community have decided that needs to change for
the better. Based on discussions at the XMPP Summit last week in
Portland, Oregon, I have drafted a plan for upgrading the XMPP network
to always-on, mandatory, ubiquitous encryption. You can find it here:
In short: we owe it to those who use XMPP technologies to improve the
security of the network (and thanks to Thijs Alkemade, we now have
better ways to test such security, using the newly-launched "IM
Observatory" at xmpp.net). Although we know that channel encryption is
not the complete answer, it's the right thing to do because it will
help to protect people's communications from prying eyes.
If you or your organization develop XMPP-compatible software or run a
service that's connected to the XMPP network, I encourage you to sign
the statement by following the instructions in the README at the URL
shown above.
