the question highlights how ill-suited the 'spy agencies'​​ are for
conducting asymmetric anything.
Unless they had a Brain inside think of a mechanism and explain it to an
Engineer to propose to a Facilities Security Manager who obtained
confirmation from a Director, they would be vulnerable.
For instance, TEMPEST security - every SCIF has it because inside it was
well documented/implemented.  SEISMIC security - no SCIF*** is isolated
from seismic vibrations modulated with data.  So, to ex-filtrate data, have
those passing circus elephants stomp their feet in predetermined patterns.
 Or make one of those "Dune" style thumpers.  The worms in this case being

*** I'm suppose some very few SCIFs are vibration isolated for various
reasons, but not as an exfil channel.

​I'll suggest a slightly different scenario.  One in which Stone is
presenting his honest opinion, and in which what he spoke is accurate.
I don't know much about him - I think I'm fairly safe in stating prior to
his Review panel he never went close to, let alone through, the Ft. Meade
perimeter onto NSA grounds.
Doing so is awe inspiring.  Not just with heady notions of which agency,
and its history, runs the building; but also seeing the scale of the
operations.  It's a visceral reminder of the power of the United States -
both of it's good and bad aspects.​
​So, I suggest Mr. Stone was overwhelmed and genuinely convinced of what he
saw: he wanted to see a behemoth of an organization full
of sun-glassed covert agents ​running amok.  Rather he saw slightly
shabbily dressed day workers interspersed with the occasional suit,
all surrounded by  uniformed members of the five military branches as well
as those of five other countries.
Second, I suggest the NSA ( and any other semi-/fully- covert agency ) can
easily "expose" all of its bookkeeping for review without exposing anything
it doesn't want exposed.  They don't need to be secretive - the nature of
the organization is so silo'd, looking in from any combination of
directions would never give any indication of a compartment unless one knew
where and how to request that compartment by name.
The result is the Review panel feels they came away with a complete
understanding of the Agency, and the individuals came away with a knew
understanding of what Power means, and how it is applied into the world.
 Some of that understanding is valid - some isn't.
Lastly, I think taking Mr. Stone's words as only about the NSA is a
mistake.  He was writing to, and about, the Agency employees. Namely,
suggesting to them they might do better in the future
to continually re-evaluate their bosses; rather than assuming "father knows
best."  And this is the best possible oversight - the tens of thousands of
employees are as American as anyone, they have it in their own best
interest not to tolerate abuses by their bosses.  Sadly that type of
oversight is insufficient, but that mindset within the majority of
employees is crucial and what I think Mr. Stone was trying to enrich.

Let's be more specific.
Child:  a minor under custodianship of another.
Supervision:  providing meaningful oversight.
No child would rightfully be raised without supervision - you don't let
toddlers walk across the street, you don't let 6 year olds watch porn, and
you don't let teens go to the local pub (okay, last one is location
dependent).  Are you committing child-porn when you oversee your 2 year old
dressing?  Are you censoring their ability to dress themselves by helping
them choose (weather, etc) appropriate clothes?
Many things in life, while we are growing and becoming mature (a process
lasting well into our mid-20s), require oversight.  Both for safely and
utility.  We can pretend otherwise at our and the child's own peril.  Go
ahead and let your child smoke cigs, watch porn and read reddit; it's your
child - do as you feel best - I suspect my child will find yours to be ....
socially repugnant.
The point is blanket statements like you made are corrosive to the
understanding of the discussion.  Unfettered support of "the child" in all
situations is counterproductive.
Don't get going on "Parents don't always know best" ... true, they don't -
but as long as Society allows any person in any circumstance to _have_ a
child without any sort of parenting training, oversight, counselling, then
Society must allow that person the ability to _raise_ their child.  For
better or ill.

@_subject: state cordblood requirement ... 
​Not too disagree with the notion it might not be at sometime, but
currently?  No.  Also, not disagreeing with the notion of how it will be
In fact I don't think any jurisdiction anywhere currently requires or even
recommends any storage of cord-blood.  Would be nice if they did actually -
it's a very useful thing to have for one's future.
All states already require permanent cryobanking of

​Specifically job hunters/HR department types.
They lack the opsec training.  And, inspite of never having had a clearance
or working in an agency (mostly), they usually learn of coverterms/project
names which managers are hiring from because even thouse with training
often slip or don't know.  Then the HR people use those terms for attention
getting of possible candidate - and everyone wants to appear "in the know"
as to be credible.

​Indeed.  try removing your resume once you've made the mistake of
uploading it!  Maybe if I went paid account route I might be able to, but
... somehow ... doubt it.

haha, that's a good one.  Only a job recruiter could smile while spouting

@_subject: Threat Model: Parents 
Several responses have stated, and questioned, the children's rights
accessing the Internet.  Yes, with supervision.  What all the responses
have missed is the lack of distinction between communication and email.
Claiming a child has a right to private extra-familial communications is as
divided as the general access to the Internet.  With supervision, without
any more or less privacy than the child has in non-virtual communications.
And, what hasn't been connected to deciding on the level of supervision,
the developmental state of the child is highly relevant.
Claiming a child merits access - with or without supervision - can only be
made by the primary custodians of the child.
We wish to ignore this subtlety because we wish to ignore Society's
overbearing on all of us.
The result in this specific scenario is, regardless of the child, the
custodians require and merit a higher degree of technical faculty.  To
presume it is less than the childs is a mistake.  Along with this ability
comes the burden of communication: to provide an appropriate example.  As
with many non-virtual counterparts:   many failure.  such sad.
Why should this medium of bits be different?
