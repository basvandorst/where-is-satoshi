Check out the user documentation, where you see which concepts we apply
and also how to import already existing keys:
On the very general approach of pEp, also this IETF draft might help;
that's somewhat more technical, but still high-level (pointing to more
technical drafts):

Dear Cypherpunks!
We just released beta installers for macOS and Windows to engage in
automatic email encryption with Thunderbird (v68 and v78), with in-band
key exchange and a mechanism to synchronize own devices [0][1], using
the same email address.

@_subject: FreeAssange.net action network: copy-paste action formats & 
Dear Cypherpunk folks
From Switzerland, we created an action network to raise awareness about
the Assange Case--and we demand Assange's immediate release!
From the Press Release from Sep 7th; more to follow:
* * *
For 10 years now the USA has been chasing journalist and Wikileaks
founder Julian Assange. In doing so, they are not shy in violating the
rule of law and human rights.
The determination is clear. Every journalist should be discouraged from
reporting facts that may not be convenient for the USA. That is why the
trial, which started again today in London, is not only about the
extradition of Julian Assange. Our free press, and therefore also our
democracy, are in serious dangers, if the USA is not put in its place.
The extradition of Assange is a dangerous precedent. Therefore we demand
At this occasion, the FreeAssange.net action network organized today
before the start of the session a flash mob on the “Bundesplatz” (the
Federal Square) to draw attention to this process, which is highly
dangerous for our democracy.
We call on governments to clearly stand up for fundamental freedoms and
to call for London and Washington to immediately end the hunt against
Julian Assange.

How did you access the site, with a scanner or "manually"? I think you
triggered some "protective" WAF functionality from cyon.ch. A complaint
when out, for now.
The site as is is not set up with Google/NSA/other US Nazi surveillance
state stuff... :)
