What is your opinion on permissionless decentralized exchange for erc20 tokens?   Everyone can list any token in automized way.    Everyone is responsible for his own funds and tokens that he/she lists and trades.
It is p2p, permissionless, immutable, transparent, decentralized and semi anonymous.
If you are interested try this one Write your comments in the troll box and let the shitstorm begin ;)

Hello cypherpunks,
I am interested in your opinion of decentralized exchanges - DEXes.   Do you think that it is good alternative of the centralized ones?
I checked some of them and I think that one of the biggest problems is the liquidity and user experience, but they also have a lot of advantages:
  Extremely secure  Users have full control over their funds  Everything you need is public/privatekey, metamask or hardware wallet  It is not required any personal data  No one can stop the smart contract - it is unstoppable, because is running on the blockchain  The code is open source   I have some friends which are building a DEX and they are focused on the security, transparency and UI.
You could check their platform here:      I would be always happy to discuss anything regarding blockchain and DEXes.    Keep you privacy and digital identity save!
