The motivation could be "make it possible for website authors to make a
living without Google Adwords & other stupid ads" and that rocks, IMHO.
Everything is wasteful you know. Buying things is mostly a waste of
ressources. But at least let me decide what kind of waste I want to produce!
Or just go the Zerzan way but then start by throwing away your computer
and blowing up the nearest electricity poles.

By "their" you meant tidbit devs' motivation or New Jersey internet
sheriffs' motivation?

@_subject: web based shared secret symmetric encryption application 
I'm looking for a decent free and open source application that would
work similarly to "Hushmail Express message"
that would allow me to deposit an encrypted message on an apache web
server that would be decrypted by the recipient using a shared secret
(that's already established, so I don't need a key exchange mechanism).
I read Tony's posts and his blog article
( and I'm well aware
that browser based encryption is not optimal but I'm just looking for
something slightly more secure than plain text email that could be used
by an end user not willing to install GPG, not an NSA proof secure system.
The (apache2/debian7) web server is physically under my control, I'm the
only root (I hope! :-) and SSL/TLS is enabled.
Thanks for your advice.

What do you mean by that precisely?
I don't think PGP/GPG/OpenPGP is meant to encrypt private keys on
servers. In what way OpenPG or GnuPG would be linked with keybase.io
private key encryption scheme or algorithms choice? I don't know
everything about OpenPGP standard but I'm pretty sure it doesn't deal
with such things.
Again, what has PGP/GPG/OpenPGP to do with keybase.io good or bad
choices (you don't seem to know anything about that either by the way
:-) regarding encryption of secrets on their servers? I don't get it.

Maybe you could create a signing subkey specifically for your cell phone.
