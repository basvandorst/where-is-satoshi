@_subject: Apple Card will not allow purchase of cryptocurrencies 
The articles claims the banks are concerned that volatile prices of cryptocurrencies could leave consumers with debts they are unable to pay. That's rubbish. The banks are concerned as such but not in the connotation I believe most would construe. The volatile price might rise so rapidly everyone might actually use their credit to obtain and use cryptocoin and then not pay back their debts as banks have no recourse to collect debts except in dollars through courts, i.e. lien on your paycheck or direct freeze of bank account. Whatever they say, I think the bankers are only scared of cryptocurrency and can't survive in a bitcoin economy where they can't control the creation nor the transfer of money.

Without a race, there will be no individuals of that race, optimal biological partners are third and fourth cousins, see "An Association Between the Kinship and Fertility of Human Couples", they have the most healthy babies. Outbreeding is breeding without one's "race" which could be defined to be really 6th cousins and beyond, and it's a thing that can be as genetically dangerous as inbreeding which is breeding with siblings and 1st cousins.
I think the idea it is possible to blend all races successfully without simply causing mass unfitness and mass defects in anything less than ten thousand years is mere imperial delusions of grandeur spurred on by madmen's pride.
