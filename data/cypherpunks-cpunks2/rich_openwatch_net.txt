Free and Open 4G radios/base stations are actually quite exciting for this
reason. The thing which actually prevents mesh networks from working is
mathematical: past a certain network size, path finding becomes too
computationally expensive, so wifi based mesh networks can only cover a
certain radius before they stop working. With the 4G spectrum, however, the
distances between hops vastly increases, meaning that city-wide mesh
networks can grow and remain performant. This allows for free communication
and file transfer without centralized authorities. Obviously there are
still threats, but there is a lot of freedom gained from network autonomy.

@_subject: Private Distributed Hash Tables 
Far too much yap yap yappin' around here lately.. cpunks write code,
remember? Let's get back to business.
Here's an idea for a private, censorship-resistant communication/file
sharing system with integrated invitations and access control. I don't
think I've ever seen this before, but it's quite possible that people have
discussed this idea previously. Either way, I don't know of any
implementations yet.
The current P2P file sharing landscape is divided up into two spaces: 1)
private tracker communities (what.cd // Demonoid // etc) which provide high
quality network speeds and file quality through moderation, but which are
often subject to outages due to centralization, and 2) the single giant
BitTorrent 'peer exchange' distributed hash table, which provides universal
file access and fault-tolerance, but at the cost of abuse and surveillance
of those participating.
Ideally, we want a peer-to-peer community which is decentralized and
fault-tolerant, but with enough authority to maintain a high network
quality and private enough to avoid open surveillance.
Proposed Solution
It might be possible to combine the exclusivity and moderation of private
trackers with the fault-tolerance of distributed hash tables by having each
private table operate with a certificated-authority based public key
infrastructure. Essentially, to participate in the DHT, peers must
cryptographically prove that they have been invited to participate.
Power and trust flow down a through a concentric certificate web. A
client's authority in the network is a function of how far away from the
root authority they are (not dissimilar to Scientology's hierarchy.)
Clients should automatically respect commands coming from those higher up
the cert chain or from those closer to the root than they are, and should
listen to, but not automatically respect, commands from those lower down
the cert chain or from "lower-ranking" clients.
* Bootstrapping and Invitation
The very first user of the network will have to generate a root
certificate. He is then able to generate new signing certificates, which he
can give to new users of a network to allow them the ability to access the
network. These new users should be able to use their own certificates to do
the same for their own new users. (This could be done with certificate
signing requests coming from potential new users as well, but that might
come at the cost of a slightly more complicated user experience).
* Revocation
Bannings can be performed by issuing updates to a network-wide revocation
list. Clients will automatically respect revocations coming from superiors,
and may or may not choose to respect revocations coming from underlings.
* Implementation
Everything needed to create the heart of this should exist already in
Kademlia and OpenSSL. BitTorrent could serve as the basis for the
file-sharing application, but vanilla BitTorrent has a content discovery
problem, so I'd suggest that any implementations of BitTorrent on Private
Distributed Hash Tables should have some kind of discovery BEP included as
well, possibly one which uses the authority system of the PDHT to verify
files. There's also a possibility there for what you might call "trusted
amnesia" - the ability for a user with a high authority to publish verified
documents to the whole network without having to broadly expose themselves
as the source of the content by having peers in their same trust level sign
their content, forget the source, then increase the availability by one
access level.
Anyway, that's the sketch. Any thoughts?

I suppose RetroShare and GNUnet are similar in that they have 'Friend to
Friend' capabilities, but as we see in practice, they don't create
high-quality networks because there is no hierarchy of trust or
discoverability of new users - by default, users can't interact with
'friends-of-friends', which means that what should be "Private P2P"
networks degrade to "Group P2P" networks of only a few people. This
proposed system should be able to accommodate thousands of users while
still providing the aforementioned benefits.

Full text:
* Abstract
A Stealth Address is a new type of Bitcoin address and related
scriptPubKey/transaction generation scheme that allowers payees to
publish a single, fixed, address that payors can send funds efficiently,
privately, reliably and non-interactively. Payors do not learn what
other payments have been made to the stealth address, and third-parties
learn nothing at all. (both subject to an adjustable anonymity set)
* Acknowledgments
Credit goes to ByteCoin for the original idea.(1) Gregory Maxwell, Adam
Back, and others on  contributed valuable input on the
implementation. Finally thanks goes to Amir Taaki for input on the
general idea of stealth addresses and use-cases.
* Background
Viewed generally a Bitcoin address is a mechanism by which a payee
instructs a payor to create a transaction such that the payee can spend
one or more of the transaction outputs. Of course, typically the address
is simply the hash of a pubkey, and the mechanism by which the funds are
made available to the payee is to simply create a scriptPubKey of the
following form:
    DUP HASH160  EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG
The problem however is address reuse: it is convenient for payees to
give one or more payor a single address and use it multiple times for
various purposes. This results in all those payments becoming trivially
linkable to each other by an attacker - a threat not only to the privacy
of the user, but also to all users of Bitcoin.(2)
BIP32 hierarchical deterministic wallets are frequently proposed as a
solution. Now an address is a chain code and the mechanism by which a
scriptPubKey is generated is to derive a one-time-use pubkey from that
chain code and some index i. However, this quickly runs into two main
1) Lack of privacy: While someone not in possession of the address can't
   link payments together, someone who is can.
2) State: If the index is not to be re-used wallets must either maintain
   per-address state, or somehow query for already used indexes, or
   somehow generate them in a sufficiently small range that the payee
   can recover the indexes. All these solutions are problematic.
A good example of where the BIP32-derivation solutions fails come up at
the Dark Wallet Hackathon where it was suggested by the author that for
the purpose of securing person-to-person payments OpenPGP public keys
and X.509 certificates be extended with a new user-id field containing a
Bitcoin address. Wallet software could then use either certificate
system to ensure funds were being sent to the intended recipients -
essentially a non-interactive way of solving what the BIP70 payment
protocol solves interactively. Of course, without stealth addresses the
scheme would likely have little or no privacy.
* Requirements
1) Generated scriptPubKey must be globally unique
2) Must be only spendable by payee
3) scriptPubKey and associated transaction must be indistinguishable to
   third-parties from other transactions in some anonymity set.
4) Method must be fully deterministic and funds recoverable from a
   wallet seed and blockchain data for both payee and payor.
5) Funds must be efficiently recoverable by payee with reasonable, and
   configurable, computation and bandwidth costs.
6) Must be compatible with CoinJoin/Must not leak information to payee
   about what txins were used to pay them.
7) Must be compatible with multisig-protected wallets.
8) Must not make assumptions about txin scriptSig form.
9) Must be possible to prove to third parties that payment was made in
   accordance to instructions without revealing any other information.
** Payment Reliability
Schemes for making payments by transmitting nonces to the recipient
through some other medium, such as Bitmessage, were discussed at the
Dark Wallet Hackathon. However using any medium but the blockchain
itself for the communication means that the reliability of the payment
getting to the recipient is less than that of a standard transaction.
For instance Bitmessage nodes only keep messages for two weeks. We
decided that anything less than reliable atomic transactions was
* Applying encryption to payments, simple explanation
Using Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) we can generate a shared
secret that the payee can use to recover their funds. Let the payee have
keypair Q=dG. The payor generates nonce keypair P=eG and uses ECDH to
arrive at shared secret c=H(eQ)=H(dP). This secret could be used to
derive a ECC secret key, and from that a scriptPubKey, however that
would allow both payor and payee the ability to spend the funds. So
instead we use BIP32-style derivation to create Q'=(Q+c)G and associated
As for the nonce keypair, that is included in the transaction in an
additional zero-valued output:
    RETURN The payee recovers the funds by scanning the blockchain for candiate P's
in transactions, regenerating the scriptPubKey, and finally checking if
any txouts in the transactions match. Note the close similarity of this
technique to how the Bitmessage network functions - an initial
implementation of the idea will find the Bitmessage code a suitable
starting point.
* Trading off anonymity set size for decreased bandwidth/CPU
By taking advantage of prefix filters(3) we can choose a tradeoff
between anonymity set size and bandwidth/CPU usage if the payee
specifies that payments to them are to match some short prefix k. There
are a few possibilities for how the prefix is to the applied - the most
simple is if per-block indexes of scriptPubKeys are available:
    RETURN  Alternatively if per-block indexes of H(scriptPubKeys) are only
available the wallet software can grind the scriptPubKey with nonce i
until it matches the specified prefix:
    RETURN  Furthermore as symmetric ciphers are quite cheap we might as well hide
the purpose of the OP_RETURN txout and encrypt the pubkey P using H(Q)
as a symmetric key. This gives us a slightly larger anonymity set.
* Advantages of using a separate output
An alternative would be to either re-use a pubkey or signature nonce
value from a transaction input, saving about 45 bytes per txout. An
absolute minimum sized Bitcoin transaction is 166 bytes(4) so at best we
have a 27% savings in tx fees, and more typically around ~15%. (modulo
mass-payments from a single txin)
However using an explicit prunable OP_RETURN output to store the pubkey
rather than re-using one from a txin or txin signature has a number of
1) The txin's owned by the payor are not revealed to the payee. In fact,
   they could be held by a third-party who simply makes a transaction
   with the appropriate txouts on behalf of the payee.
2) Less information about the txouts is leaked. The statistical
   distribution of txouts remains unchanged - not possible in re-use
   schemes because they need to grind the payee scriptPubKey's for the
   sake of the prefix filters.
3) If required the nonce secret can be revealed to prove that a payment
   was made to a third-party, e.g. for dispute resolution.
* Bare CHECK(MULTI)SIG output alternative
An alternative with better efficiency could be to use bare
OP_CHECK(MULTI)SIG outputs to hold the nonce pubkey - generally a second
output is needed anyway for change. The most simple would be to use Jeff
Garzik's OP_DROP proposal(5) for the prefix:
   DROP n ... m CHECKMULTISIG
  or
   DROP  CHECKSIG
The payor pubkey is in the *change* txout, and the payee's ECDH-derived
pubkey in the other txout. By setting the prefix to be the same on both
txouts and using the same basic scriptPubKey form the relationship of
change and payment is still hidden; CoinJoin-using implementations can
adopt even more sophisticated approaches.
If IsStandard() rules remain the same and using OP_DROP is impractical,
we can also grind the change pubkey to match the prefix in a
deterministic manner so the wallet can still be recovered from a seed.
More costly, but maybe still acceptable for reasonably short prefixes.
Either way the result is transactions that are actually smaller and
cheaper than standard transactions, although without the advantage of
pushing scriptPubKey size payment to the receiver. (a pity we didn't
spend the extra time to adopt OP_EVAL)
A disadvantage is that revealing the nonce secret to prove a payment was
made is more problematic - either the txout needs to be spent first, or
we need a CHECKMULTISIG.
* Address format
To be decided. To support mulisig we probably want the ability to
specify n-of-m master pubkeys, using the nonce to generate derived ones.
For the single pubkey case the addresses will be a little longer than
standard Bitcoin addresses:

*Defendants Sold Bitcoins to be Used to Buy and Sell Illegal Drugs
Anonymously on the Silk Road Drug Trafficking Website*
Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New
York, James J. Hunt, the Acting Special-Agent-in-Charge of the New York
Field Division of the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), and Toni
Weirauch, the Special Agent-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the
Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (“IRS-CI”), announced the
unsealing of criminal charges in Manhattan federal court against ROBERT M.
FAIELLA, a/k/a “BTCKing,” an underground Bitcoin exchanger, and CHARLIE
SHREM, the Chief Executive Officer and Compliance Officer of a Bitcoin
exchange company, for engaging in a scheme to sell over $1 million in
Bitcoins to users of “Silk Road,” the underground website that enabled its
users to buy and sell illegal drugs anonymously and beyond the reach of law
enforcement. Each defendant is charged with conspiring to commit money
laundering, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. SHREM
is also charged with willfully failing to file any suspicious activity
report regarding FAIELLA’s illegal transactions through the Company, in
violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. SCHREM was arrested yesterday at John F.
Kennedy International Airport in New York, and is expected to be presented
in Manhattan federal court later today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Henry
Pitman. FAIELLA was arrested today at his residence in Cape Coral, Florida,
and is expected to be presented in federal court in the Middle District of
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: “As alleged, Robert Faiella and
Charlie Shrem schemed to sell over $1 million in Bitcoins to criminals bent
on trafficking narcotics on the dark web drug site, Silk Road. Truly
innovative business models don’t need to resort to old-fashioned
law-breaking, and when Bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are
laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice
but to act. We will aggressively pursue those who would coopt new forms of
currency for illicit purposes.”
DEA Acting Special-Agent-in-Charge James J. Hunt said: “The charges
announced today depict law enforcement's commitment to identifying those
who promote the sale of illegal drugs throughout the world. Hiding behind
their computers, both defendants are charged with knowingly contributing to
and facilitating anonymous drug sales, earning substantial profits along
the way. Drug law enforcement's job is to investigate and identify those
who abet the illicit drug trade at all levels of production and
distribution including those lining their own pockets by feigning ignorance
of any wrong doing and turning a blind eye.”
IRS Special-Agent-in-Charge Toni Weirauch said: “The government has been
successful in swiftly identifying those responsible for the design and
operation of the ‘Silk Road’ website, as well as those who helped ‘Silk
Road’ customers conduct their illegal transactions by facilitating the
conversion of their dollars into Bitcoins. This is yet another example of
the New York Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Strike Force’s proficiency in
applying financial investigative resources to the fight against illegal
According to the allegations contained in the Criminal Complaint unsealed
today in Manhattan federal court:
Bitcoin exchange on the Silk Road website, a website that served as a
sprawling and anonymous black market bazaar where illegal drugs of
virtually every variety were bought and sold regularly by the site’s users.
Operating under the username “BTCKing,” FAIELLA sold Bitcoins – the only
form of payment accepted on Silk Road – to users seeking to buy illegal
drugs on the site. Upon receiving orders for Bitcoins from Silk Road users,
he filled the orders through a company based in New York, New York (the
“Company”). The Company was designed to enable customers to exchange cash
for Bitcoins anonymously, that is, without providing any personal
identifying information, and it charged a fee for its service. FAIELLA
obtained Bitcoins with the Company’s assistance, and then sold the Bitcoins
to Silk Road users at a markup.
SHREM is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and from about August
2011 until about July 2013, when the Company ceased operating, he was also
its Compliance Officer, in charge of ensuring the Company’s compliance with
federal and other anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws. SHREM is also the
Vice Chairman of a foundation dedicated to promoting the Bitcoin virtual
currency system.
SHREM, who personally bought drugs on Silk Road, was fully aware that Silk
Road was a drug-trafficking website, and through his communications with
FAIELLA, SHREM also knew that FAIELLA was operating a Bitcoin exchange
service for Silk Road users. Nevertheless, SHREM knowingly facilitated
FAIELLA’s business with the Company in order to maintain FAIELLA’s business
as a lucrative source of Company revenue. SHREM knowingly allowed FAIELLA
to use the Company’s services to buy Bitcoins for his Silk Road customers;
personally processed FAIELLA’s orders; gave FAIELLA discounts on his
high-volume transactions; failed to file a single suspicious activity
report with the United States Treasury Department about FAIELLA’s illicit
activity, as he was otherwise required to do in his role as the Company’s
Compliance Officer; and deliberately helped FAIELLA circumvent the
Company’s AML restrictions, even though it was SHREM’s job to enforce them
and even though the Company had registered with the Treasury Department as
a money services business.
Working together, SHREM and FAIELLA exchanged over $1 million in cash for
Bitcoins for the benefit of Silk Road users, so that the users could, in
turn, make illegal purchases on Silk Road.
In late 2012, when the Company stopped accepting cash payments, FAIELLA
ceased doing business with the Company and temporarily shut down his
illegal Bitcoin exchange service on Silk Road. FAIELLA resumed operating on
Silk Road in April 2013 without the Company’s assistance, and continued to
exchange tens of thousands of dollars a week in Bitcoins until the Silk
Road website was shut down by law enforcement in October 2013.
*                      *                      *
FAIELLA, 52, of Cape Coral, Florida, and SHREM, 24, of New York, New York,
are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering,
which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and one count of
operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a
maximum sentence of five years in prison. SHREM is also charged with one
count of willful failure to file a suspicious activity report, which
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.
Mr. Bharara praised the outstanding investigative work of the DEA’s New
York Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Strike Force, which is comprised of
agents and officers of the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the New
York City Police Department, Immigration and Customs Enforcement - Homeland
Security Investigations, the New York State Police, the U. S. Internal

U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. Marshal Service, New York National Guard,
Office of Foreign Assets Control and the New York Department of Taxation
and Finance. Mr. Bharara also thanked the FBI’s New York Field Office.
Mr. Bharara also noted that the investigation remains ongoing.
The prosecution of this case is being handled by the Office’s Complex
Frauds Unit. Assistant United States Attorney Serrin Turner is in charge of
the prosecution, and Assistant United States Attorney Andrew Adams of the
Asset Forfeiture Unit is in charge of the forfeiture aspects of the case.

If You Used This Secure Webmail Site, the FBI Has Your Inbox
   - By Kevin Poulsen
   - 01.27.14
   - 6:30 AM
While investigating a hosting company known for sheltering child porn last
year the FBI incidentally seized the entire e-mail database of a popular
anonymous webmail service called TorMail.
Now the FBI is tapping that vast trove of e-mail in unrelated
The bureau's data windfall, seized from a company called Freedom Hosting,
surfaced in court papers last week when prosecutors indicted a Florida man
for allegedly selling counterfeit credit cards online. The filings show the
FBI built its case in part by executing a search warrant on a Gmail account
used by the counterfeiters, where they found that orders for forged cards
were being sent to a TorMail e-mail account: "platplus
Acting on that lead in September, the FBI obtained a search warrant for the
TorMail account, and then accessed it from the bureau's own copy of "data
and information from the TorMail e-mail server, including the content of
TorMail e-mail accounts," according to the
sworn out by U.S. Postal Inspector Eric Malecki.
The tactic suggests the FBI is adapting to the age of big-data with an
NSA-style collect-everything approach, gathering information into a virtual
lock box, and leaving it there until it can obtain specific authority to
tap it later. There's no indication that the FBI searched the trove for
incriminating evidence before getting a warrant. But now that it has a copy
of TorMail's servers, the bureau can execute endless search warrants on a
mail service that once boasted of being immune to spying.
"We have no information to give you or to respond to any subpoenas or court
orders," read TorMail's homepage. "Do not bother contacting us for
information on, or to view the contents of a TorMail user inbox, you will
be ignored."
In another e-mail case, the FBI last year won a court order compelling
secure e-mail provider Lavabit to turn over the master encryption
its website, which would have given agents the technical ability to
on all of Lavabit's 400,000 users - though the government said it was

@_subject: Private Distributed Hash Tables 
Far too much yap yap yappin' around here lately.. cpunks write code,
remember? Let's get back to business.
Here's an idea for a private, censorship-resistant communication/file
sharing system with integrated invitations and access control. I don't
think I've ever seen this before, but it's quite possible that people have
discussed this idea previously. Either way, I don't know of any
implementations yet.
The current P2P file sharing landscape is divided up into two spaces: 1)
private tracker communities (what.cd // Demonoid // etc) which provide high
quality network speeds and file quality through moderation, but which are
often subject to outages due to centralization, and 2) the single giant
BitTorrent 'peer exchange' distributed hash table, which provides universal
file access and fault-tolerance, but at the cost of abuse and surveillance
of those participating.
Ideally, we want a peer-to-peer community which is decentralized and
fault-tolerant, but with enough authority to maintain a high network
quality and private enough to avoid open surveillance.
Proposed Solution
It might be possible to combine the exclusivity and moderation of private
trackers with the fault-tolerance of distributed hash tables by having each
private table operate with a certificated-authority based public key
infrastructure. Essentially, to participate in the DHT, peers must
cryptographically prove that they have been invited to participate.
Power and trust flow down a through a concentric certificate web. A
client's authority in the network is a function of how far away from the
root authority they are (not dissimilar to Scientology's hierarchy.)
Clients should automatically respect commands coming from those higher up
the cert chain or from those closer to the root than they are, and should
listen to, but not automatically respect, commands from those lower down
the cert chain or from "lower-ranking" clients.
* Bootstrapping and Invitation
The very first user of the network will have to generate a root
certificate. He is then able to generate new signing certificates, which he
can give to new users of a network to allow them the ability to access the
network. These new users should be able to use their own certificates to do
the same for their own new users. (This could be done with certificate
signing requests coming from potential new users as well, but that might
come at the cost of a slightly more complicated user experience).
* Revocation
Bannings can be performed by issuing updates to a network-wide revocation
list. Clients will automatically respect revocations coming from superiors,
and may or may not choose to respect revocations coming from underlings.
* Implementation
Everything needed to create the heart of this should exist already in
Kademlia and OpenSSL. BitTorrent could serve as the basis for the
file-sharing application, but vanilla BitTorrent has a content discovery
problem, so I'd suggest that any implementations of BitTorrent on Private
Distributed Hash Tables should have some kind of discovery BEP included as
well, possibly one which uses the authority system of the PDHT to verify
files. There's also a possibility there for what you might call "trusted
amnesia" - the ability for a user with a high authority to publish verified
documents to the whole network without having to broadly expose themselves
as the source of the content by having peers in their same trust level sign
their content, forget the source, then increase the availability by one
access level.
Anyway, that's the sketch. Any thoughts?

I suppose RetroShare and GNUnet are similar in that they have 'Friend to
Friend' capabilities, but as we see in practice, they don't create
high-quality networks because there is no hierarchy of trust or
discoverability of new users - by default, users can't interact with
'friends-of-friends', which means that what should be "Private P2P"
networks degrade to "Group P2P" networks of only a few people. This
proposed system should be able to accommodate thousands of users while
still providing the aforementioned benefits.

In response to the earlier chatter about BitCoin privacy..

Full text:
* Abstract
A Stealth Address is a new type of Bitcoin address and related
scriptPubKey/transaction generation scheme that allowers payees to
publish a single, fixed, address that payors can send funds efficiently,
privately, reliably and non-interactively. Payors do not learn what
other payments have been made to the stealth address, and third-parties
learn nothing at all. (both subject to an adjustable anonymity set)
* Acknowledgments
Credit goes to ByteCoin for the original idea.(1) Gregory Maxwell, Adam
Back, and others on  contributed valuable input on the
implementation. Finally thanks goes to Amir Taaki for input on the
general idea of stealth addresses and use-cases.
* Background
Viewed generally a Bitcoin address is a mechanism by which a payee
instructs a payor to create a transaction such that the payee can spend
one or more of the transaction outputs. Of course, typically the address
is simply the hash of a pubkey, and the mechanism by which the funds are
made available to the payee is to simply create a scriptPubKey of the
following form:
    DUP HASH160  EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG
The problem however is address reuse: it is convenient for payees to
give one or more payor a single address and use it multiple times for
various purposes. This results in all those payments becoming trivially
linkable to each other by an attacker - a threat not only to the privacy
of the user, but also to all users of Bitcoin.(2)
BIP32 hierarchical deterministic wallets are frequently proposed as a
solution. Now an address is a chain code and the mechanism by which a
scriptPubKey is generated is to derive a one-time-use pubkey from that
chain code and some index i. However, this quickly runs into two main
1) Lack of privacy: While someone not in possession of the address can't
   link payments together, someone who is can.
2) State: If the index is not to be re-used wallets must either maintain
   per-address state, or somehow query for already used indexes, or
   somehow generate them in a sufficiently small range that the payee
   can recover the indexes. All these solutions are problematic.
A good example of where the BIP32-derivation solutions fails come up at
the Dark Wallet Hackathon where it was suggested by the author that for
the purpose of securing person-to-person payments OpenPGP public keys
and X.509 certificates be extended with a new user-id field containing a
Bitcoin address. Wallet software could then use either certificate
system to ensure funds were being sent to the intended recipients -
essentially a non-interactive way of solving what the BIP70 payment
protocol solves interactively. Of course, without stealth addresses the
scheme would likely have little or no privacy.
* Requirements
1) Generated scriptPubKey must be globally unique
2) Must be only spendable by payee
3) scriptPubKey and associated transaction must be indistinguishable to
   third-parties from other transactions in some anonymity set.
4) Method must be fully deterministic and funds recoverable from a
   wallet seed and blockchain data for both payee and payor.
5) Funds must be efficiently recoverable by payee with reasonable, and
   configurable, computation and bandwidth costs.
6) Must be compatible with CoinJoin/Must not leak information to payee
   about what txins were used to pay them.
7) Must be compatible with multisig-protected wallets.
8) Must not make assumptions about txin scriptSig form.
9) Must be possible to prove to third parties that payment was made in
   accordance to instructions without revealing any other information.
** Payment Reliability
Schemes for making payments by transmitting nonces to the recipient
through some other medium, such as Bitmessage, were discussed at the
Dark Wallet Hackathon. However using any medium but the blockchain
itself for the communication means that the reliability of the payment
getting to the recipient is less than that of a standard transaction.
For instance Bitmessage nodes only keep messages for two weeks. We
decided that anything less than reliable atomic transactions was
* Applying encryption to payments, simple explanation
Using Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) we can generate a shared
secret that the payee can use to recover their funds. Let the payee have
keypair Q=dG. The payor generates nonce keypair P=eG and uses ECDH to
arrive at shared secret c=H(eQ)=H(dP). This secret could be used to
derive a ECC secret key, and from that a scriptPubKey, however that
would allow both payor and payee the ability to spend the funds. So
instead we use BIP32-style derivation to create Q'=(Q+c)G and associated
As for the nonce keypair, that is included in the transaction in an
additional zero-valued output:
    RETURN The payee recovers the funds by scanning the blockchain for candiate P's
in transactions, regenerating the scriptPubKey, and finally checking if
any txouts in the transactions match. Note the close similarity of this
technique to how the Bitmessage network functions - an initial
implementation of the idea will find the Bitmessage code a suitable
starting point.
* Trading off anonymity set size for decreased bandwidth/CPU
By taking advantage of prefix filters(3) we can choose a tradeoff
between anonymity set size and bandwidth/CPU usage if the payee
specifies that payments to them are to match some short prefix k. There
are a few possibilities for how the prefix is to the applied - the most
simple is if per-block indexes of scriptPubKeys are available:
    RETURN  Alternatively if per-block indexes of H(scriptPubKeys) are only
available the wallet software can grind the scriptPubKey with nonce i
until it matches the specified prefix:
    RETURN  Furthermore as symmetric ciphers are quite cheap we might as well hide
the purpose of the OP_RETURN txout and encrypt the pubkey P using H(Q)
as a symmetric key. This gives us a slightly larger anonymity set.
* Advantages of using a separate output
An alternative would be to either re-use a pubkey or signature nonce
value from a transaction input, saving about 45 bytes per txout. An
absolute minimum sized Bitcoin transaction is 166 bytes(4) so at best we
have a 27% savings in tx fees, and more typically around ~15%. (modulo
mass-payments from a single txin)
However using an explicit prunable OP_RETURN output to store the pubkey
rather than re-using one from a txin or txin signature has a number of
1) The txin's owned by the payor are not revealed to the payee. In fact,
   they could be held by a third-party who simply makes a transaction
   with the appropriate txouts on behalf of the payee.
2) Less information about the txouts is leaked. The statistical
   distribution of txouts remains unchanged - not possible in re-use
   schemes because they need to grind the payee scriptPubKey's for the
   sake of the prefix filters.
3) If required the nonce secret can be revealed to prove that a payment
   was made to a third-party, e.g. for dispute resolution.
* Bare CHECK(MULTI)SIG output alternative
An alternative with better efficiency could be to use bare
OP_CHECK(MULTI)SIG outputs to hold the nonce pubkey - generally a second
output is needed anyway for change. The most simple would be to use Jeff
Garzik's OP_DROP proposal(5) for the prefix:
   DROP n ... m CHECKMULTISIG
  or
   DROP  CHECKSIG
The payor pubkey is in the *change* txout, and the payee's ECDH-derived
pubkey in the other txout. By setting the prefix to be the same on both
txouts and using the same basic scriptPubKey form the relationship of
change and payment is still hidden; CoinJoin-using implementations can
adopt even more sophisticated approaches.
If IsStandard() rules remain the same and using OP_DROP is impractical,
we can also grind the change pubkey to match the prefix in a
deterministic manner so the wallet can still be recovered from a seed.
More costly, but maybe still acceptable for reasonably short prefixes.
Either way the result is transactions that are actually smaller and
cheaper than standard transactions, although without the advantage of
pushing scriptPubKey size payment to the receiver. (a pity we didn't
spend the extra time to adopt OP_EVAL)
A disadvantage is that revealing the nonce secret to prove a payment was
made is more problematic - either the txout needs to be spent first, or
we need a CHECKMULTISIG.
* Address format
To be decided. To support mulisig we probably want the ability to
specify n-of-m master pubkeys, using the nonce to generate derived ones.
For the single pubkey case the addresses will be a little longer than
standard Bitcoin addresses:

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Announces Charges Against Bitcoin Exchangers,
Including Ceo Of Bitcoin Exchange Company, For Scheme To Sell And Launder
Over $1 Million In Bitcoins Related To Silk Road Drug Trafficking
*FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE*
 Monday, January 27, 2014
*Defendants Sold Bitcoins to be Used to Buy and Sell Illegal Drugs
Anonymously on the Silk Road Drug Trafficking Website*
Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New
York, James J. Hunt, the Acting Special-Agent-in-Charge of the New York
Field Division of the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), and Toni
Weirauch, the Special Agent-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the
Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (“IRS-CI”), announced the
unsealing of criminal charges in Manhattan federal court against ROBERT M.
FAIELLA, a/k/a “BTCKing,” an underground Bitcoin exchanger, and CHARLIE
SHREM, the Chief Executive Officer and Compliance Officer of a Bitcoin
exchange company, for engaging in a scheme to sell over $1 million in
Bitcoins to users of “Silk Road,” the underground website that enabled its
users to buy and sell illegal drugs anonymously and beyond the reach of law
enforcement. Each defendant is charged with conspiring to commit money
laundering, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. SHREM
is also charged with willfully failing to file any suspicious activity
report regarding FAIELLA’s illegal transactions through the Company, in
violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. SCHREM was arrested yesterday at John F.
Kennedy International Airport in New York, and is expected to be presented
in Manhattan federal court later today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Henry
Pitman. FAIELLA was arrested today at his residence in Cape Coral, Florida,
and is expected to be presented in federal court in the Middle District of
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: “As alleged, Robert Faiella and
Charlie Shrem schemed to sell over $1 million in Bitcoins to criminals bent
on trafficking narcotics on the dark web drug site, Silk Road. Truly
innovative business models don’t need to resort to old-fashioned
law-breaking, and when Bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are
laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice
but to act. We will aggressively pursue those who would coopt new forms of
currency for illicit purposes.”
DEA Acting Special-Agent-in-Charge James J. Hunt said: “The charges
announced today depict law enforcement's commitment to identifying those
who promote the sale of illegal drugs throughout the world. Hiding behind
their computers, both defendants are charged with knowingly contributing to
and facilitating anonymous drug sales, earning substantial profits along
the way. Drug law enforcement's job is to investigate and identify those
who abet the illicit drug trade at all levels of production and
distribution including those lining their own pockets by feigning ignorance
of any wrong doing and turning a blind eye.”
IRS Special-Agent-in-Charge Toni Weirauch said: “The government has been
successful in swiftly identifying those responsible for the design and
operation of the ‘Silk Road’ website, as well as those who helped ‘Silk
Road’ customers conduct their illegal transactions by facilitating the
conversion of their dollars into Bitcoins. This is yet another example of
the New York Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Strike Force’s proficiency in
applying financial investigative resources to the fight against illegal
According to the allegations contained in the Criminal Complaint unsealed
today in Manhattan federal court:
Bitcoin exchange on the Silk Road website, a website that served as a
sprawling and anonymous black market bazaar where illegal drugs of
virtually every variety were bought and sold regularly by the site’s users.
Operating under the username “BTCKing,” FAIELLA sold Bitcoins – the only
form of payment accepted on Silk Road – to users seeking to buy illegal
drugs on the site. Upon receiving orders for Bitcoins from Silk Road users,
he filled the orders through a company based in New York, New York (the
“Company”). The Company was designed to enable customers to exchange cash
for Bitcoins anonymously, that is, without providing any personal
identifying information, and it charged a fee for its service. FAIELLA
obtained Bitcoins with the Company’s assistance, and then sold the Bitcoins
to Silk Road users at a markup.
SHREM is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and from about August
2011 until about July 2013, when the Company ceased operating, he was also
its Compliance Officer, in charge of ensuring the Company’s compliance with
federal and other anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws. SHREM is also the
Vice Chairman of a foundation dedicated to promoting the Bitcoin virtual
currency system.
SHREM, who personally bought drugs on Silk Road, was fully aware that Silk
Road was a drug-trafficking website, and through his communications with
FAIELLA, SHREM also knew that FAIELLA was operating a Bitcoin exchange
service for Silk Road users. Nevertheless, SHREM knowingly facilitated
FAIELLA’s business with the Company in order to maintain FAIELLA’s business
as a lucrative source of Company revenue. SHREM knowingly allowed FAIELLA
to use the Company’s services to buy Bitcoins for his Silk Road customers;
personally processed FAIELLA’s orders; gave FAIELLA discounts on his
high-volume transactions; failed to file a single suspicious activity
report with the United States Treasury Department about FAIELLA’s illicit
activity, as he was otherwise required to do in his role as the Company’s
Compliance Officer; and deliberately helped FAIELLA circumvent the
Company’s AML restrictions, even though it was SHREM’s job to enforce them
and even though the Company had registered with the Treasury Department as
a money services business.
Working together, SHREM and FAIELLA exchanged over $1 million in cash for
Bitcoins for the benefit of Silk Road users, so that the users could, in
turn, make illegal purchases on Silk Road.
In late 2012, when the Company stopped accepting cash payments, FAIELLA
ceased doing business with the Company and temporarily shut down his
illegal Bitcoin exchange service on Silk Road. FAIELLA resumed operating on
Silk Road in April 2013 without the Company’s assistance, and continued to
exchange tens of thousands of dollars a week in Bitcoins until the Silk
Road website was shut down by law enforcement in October 2013.
*                      *                      *
FAIELLA, 52, of Cape Coral, Florida, and SHREM, 24, of New York, New York,
are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering,
which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and one count of
operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a
maximum sentence of five years in prison. SHREM is also charged with one
count of willful failure to file a suspicious activity report, which
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.
Mr. Bharara praised the outstanding investigative work of the DEA’s New
York Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Strike Force, which is comprised of
agents and officers of the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the New
York City Police Department, Immigration and Customs Enforcement - Homeland
Security Investigations, the New York State Police, the U. S. Internal
Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives,
U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. Marshal Service, New York National Guard,
Office of Foreign Assets Control and the New York Department of Taxation
and Finance. Mr. Bharara also thanked the FBI’s New York Field Office.
Mr. Bharara also noted that the investigation remains ongoing.
The prosecution of this case is being handled by the Office’s Complex
Frauds Unit. Assistant United States Attorney Serrin Turner is in charge of
the prosecution, and Assistant United States Attorney Andrew Adams of the
Asset Forfeiture Unit is in charge of the forfeiture aspects of the case.
The charges contained in the Complaint are merely accusations, and the
defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

If You Used This Secure Webmail Site, the FBI Has Your Inbox
   - By Kevin Poulsen
   - 01.27.14

While investigating a hosting company known for sheltering child porn last
year the FBI incidentally seized the entire e-mail database of a popular
anonymous webmail service called TorMail.
Now the FBI is tapping that vast trove of e-mail in unrelated
The bureau's data windfall, seized from a company called Freedom Hosting,
surfaced in court papers last week when prosecutors indicted a Florida man
for allegedly selling counterfeit credit cards online. The filings show the
FBI built its case in part by executing a search warrant on a Gmail account
used by the counterfeiters, where they found that orders for forged cards
were being sent to a TorMail e-mail account: "platplus at tormail.net."
Acting on that lead in September, the FBI obtained a search warrant for the
TorMail account, and then accessed it from the bureau's own copy of "data
and information from the TorMail e-mail server, including the content of
TorMail e-mail accounts," according to the
sworn out by U.S. Postal Inspector Eric Malecki.
The tactic suggests the FBI is adapting to the age of big-data with an
NSA-style collect-everything approach, gathering information into a virtual
lock box, and leaving it there until it can obtain specific authority to
tap it later. There's no indication that the FBI searched the trove for
incriminating evidence before getting a warrant. But now that it has a copy
of TorMail's servers, the bureau can execute endless search warrants on a
mail service that once boasted of being immune to spying.
"We have no information to give you or to respond to any subpoenas or court
orders," read TorMail's homepage. "Do not bother contacting us for
information on, or to view the contents of a TorMail user inbox, you will
be ignored."
In another e-mail case, the FBI last year won a court order compelling
secure e-mail provider Lavabit to turn over the master encryption
its website, which would have given agents the technical ability to
on all of Lavabit's 400,000 users - though the government said it was
interested only in one. (Rather than comply, Lavabit shut down and is
appealing the surveillance order).
TorMail was the webmail provider of choice for denizens of the so-called
Darknet  of anonymous and
encrypted websites and services, making the FBI's cache extraordinarily
valuable. The affair also sheds a little more light on the already-strange
story of the FBI's broad attack on Freedom Hosting, once a key service
provider for untraceable websites.

@_subject: Private Distributed Hash Tables 
Far too much yap yap yappin' around here lately.. cpunks write code,
remember? Let's get back to business.
Here's an idea for a private, censorship-resistant communication/file
sharing system with integrated invitations and access control. I don't
think I've ever seen this before, but it's quite possible that people have
discussed this idea previously. Either way, I don't know of any
implementations yet.
The current P2P file sharing landscape is divided up into two spaces: 1)
private tracker communities (what.cd // Demonoid // etc) which provide high
quality network speeds and file quality through moderation, but which are
often subject to outages due to centralization, and 2) the single giant
BitTorrent 'peer exchange' distributed hash table, which provides universal
file access and fault-tolerance, but at the cost of abuse and surveillance
of those participating.
Ideally, we want a peer-to-peer community which is decentralized and
fault-tolerant, but with enough authority to maintain a high network
quality and private enough to avoid open surveillance.
Proposed Solution
It might be possible to combine the exclusivity and moderation of private
trackers with the fault-tolerance of distributed hash tables by having each
private table operate with a certificated-authority based public key
infrastructure. Essentially, to participate in the DHT, peers must
cryptographically prove that they have been invited to participate.
Power and trust flow down a through a concentric certificate web. A
client's authority in the network is a function of how far away from the
root authority they are (not dissimilar to Scientology's hierarchy.)
Clients should automatically respect commands coming from those higher up
the cert chain or from those closer to the root than they are, and should
listen to, but not automatically respect, commands from those lower down
the cert chain or from "lower-ranking" clients.
* Bootstrapping and Invitation
The very first user of the network will have to generate a root
certificate. He is then able to generate new signing certificates, which he
can give to new users of a network to allow them the ability to access the
network. These new users should be able to use their own certificates to do
the same for their own new users. (This could be done with certificate
signing requests coming from potential new users as well, but that might
come at the cost of a slightly more complicated user experience).
* Revocation
Bannings can be performed by issuing updates to a network-wide revocation
list. Clients will automatically respect revocations coming from superiors,
and may or may not choose to respect revocations coming from underlings.
* Implementation
Everything needed to create the heart of this should exist already in
Kademlia and OpenSSL. BitTorrent could serve as the basis for the
file-sharing application, but vanilla BitTorrent has a content discovery
problem, so I'd suggest that any implementations of BitTorrent on Private
Distributed Hash Tables should have some kind of discovery BEP included as
well, possibly one which uses the authority system of the PDHT to verify
files. There's also a possibility there for what you might call "trusted
amnesia" - the ability for a user with a high authority to publish verified
documents to the whole network without having to broadly expose themselves
as the source of the content by having peers in their same trust level sign
their content, forget the source, then increase the availability by one
access level.
Anyway, that's the sketch. Any thoughts?

I suppose RetroShare and GNUnet are similar in that they have 'Friend to
Friend' capabilities, but as we see in practice, they don't create
high-quality networks because there is no hierarchy of trust or
discoverability of new users - by default, users can't interact with
'friends-of-friends', which means that what should be "Private P2P"
networks degrade to "Group P2P" networks of only a few people. This
proposed system should be able to accommodate thousands of users while
still providing the aforementioned benefits.

Full text:
* Abstract
A Stealth Address is a new type of Bitcoin address and related
scriptPubKey/transaction generation scheme that allowers payees to
publish a single, fixed, address that payors can send funds efficiently,
privately, reliably and non-interactively. Payors do not learn what
other payments have been made to the stealth address, and third-parties
learn nothing at all. (both subject to an adjustable anonymity set)
* Acknowledgments
Credit goes to ByteCoin for the original idea.(1) Gregory Maxwell, Adam
Back, and others on  contributed valuable input on the
implementation. Finally thanks goes to Amir Taaki for input on the
general idea of stealth addresses and use-cases.
* Background
Viewed generally a Bitcoin address is a mechanism by which a payee
instructs a payor to create a transaction such that the payee can spend
one or more of the transaction outputs. Of course, typically the address
is simply the hash of a pubkey, and the mechanism by which the funds are
made available to the payee is to simply create a scriptPubKey of the
following form:
    DUP HASH160  EQUALVERIFY CHECKSIG
The problem however is address reuse: it is convenient for payees to
give one or more payor a single address and use it multiple times for
various purposes. This results in all those payments becoming trivially
linkable to each other by an attacker - a threat not only to the privacy
of the user, but also to all users of Bitcoin.(2)
BIP32 hierarchical deterministic wallets are frequently proposed as a
solution. Now an address is a chain code and the mechanism by which a
scriptPubKey is generated is to derive a one-time-use pubkey from that
chain code and some index i. However, this quickly runs into two main
1) Lack of privacy: While someone not in possession of the address can't
   link payments together, someone who is can.
2) State: If the index is not to be re-used wallets must either maintain
   per-address state, or somehow query for already used indexes, or
   somehow generate them in a sufficiently small range that the payee
   can recover the indexes. All these solutions are problematic.
A good example of where the BIP32-derivation solutions fails come up at
the Dark Wallet Hackathon where it was suggested by the author that for
the purpose of securing person-to-person payments OpenPGP public keys
and X.509 certificates be extended with a new user-id field containing a
Bitcoin address. Wallet software could then use either certificate
system to ensure funds were being sent to the intended recipients -
essentially a non-interactive way of solving what the BIP70 payment
protocol solves interactively. Of course, without stealth addresses the
scheme would likely have little or no privacy.
* Requirements
1) Generated scriptPubKey must be globally unique
2) Must be only spendable by payee
3) scriptPubKey and associated transaction must be indistinguishable to
   third-parties from other transactions in some anonymity set.
4) Method must be fully deterministic and funds recoverable from a
   wallet seed and blockchain data for both payee and payor.
5) Funds must be efficiently recoverable by payee with reasonable, and
   configurable, computation and bandwidth costs.
6) Must be compatible with CoinJoin/Must not leak information to payee
   about what txins were used to pay them.
7) Must be compatible with multisig-protected wallets.
8) Must not make assumptions about txin scriptSig form.
9) Must be possible to prove to third parties that payment was made in
   accordance to instructions without revealing any other information.
** Payment Reliability
Schemes for making payments by transmitting nonces to the recipient
through some other medium, such as Bitmessage, were discussed at the
Dark Wallet Hackathon. However using any medium but the blockchain
itself for the communication means that the reliability of the payment
getting to the recipient is less than that of a standard transaction.
For instance Bitmessage nodes only keep messages for two weeks. We
decided that anything less than reliable atomic transactions was
* Applying encryption to payments, simple explanation
Using Elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) we can generate a shared
secret that the payee can use to recover their funds. Let the payee have
keypair Q=dG. The payor generates nonce keypair P=eG and uses ECDH to
arrive at shared secret c=H(eQ)=H(dP). This secret could be used to
derive a ECC secret key, and from that a scriptPubKey, however that
would allow both payor and payee the ability to spend the funds. So
instead we use BIP32-style derivation to create Q'=(Q+c)G and associated
As for the nonce keypair, that is included in the transaction in an
additional zero-valued output:
    RETURN The payee recovers the funds by scanning the blockchain for candiate P's
in transactions, regenerating the scriptPubKey, and finally checking if
any txouts in the transactions match. Note the close similarity of this
technique to how the Bitmessage network functions - an initial
implementation of the idea will find the Bitmessage code a suitable
starting point.
* Trading off anonymity set size for decreased bandwidth/CPU
By taking advantage of prefix filters(3) we can choose a tradeoff
between anonymity set size and bandwidth/CPU usage if the payee
specifies that payments to them are to match some short prefix k. There
are a few possibilities for how the prefix is to the applied - the most
simple is if per-block indexes of scriptPubKeys are available:
    RETURN  Alternatively if per-block indexes of H(scriptPubKeys) are only
available the wallet software can grind the scriptPubKey with nonce i
until it matches the specified prefix:
    RETURN  Furthermore as symmetric ciphers are quite cheap we might as well hide
the purpose of the OP_RETURN txout and encrypt the pubkey P using H(Q)
as a symmetric key. This gives us a slightly larger anonymity set.
* Advantages of using a separate output
An alternative would be to either re-use a pubkey or signature nonce
value from a transaction input, saving about 45 bytes per txout. An
absolute minimum sized Bitcoin transaction is 166 bytes(4) so at best we
have a 27% savings in tx fees, and more typically around ~15%. (modulo
mass-payments from a single txin)
However using an explicit prunable OP_RETURN output to store the pubkey
rather than re-using one from a txin or txin signature has a number of
1) The txin's owned by the payor are not revealed to the payee. In fact,
   they could be held by a third-party who simply makes a transaction
   with the appropriate txouts on behalf of the payee.
2) Less information about the txouts is leaked. The statistical
   distribution of txouts remains unchanged - not possible in re-use
   schemes because they need to grind the payee scriptPubKey's for the
   sake of the prefix filters.
3) If required the nonce secret can be revealed to prove that a payment
   was made to a third-party, e.g. for dispute resolution.
* Bare CHECK(MULTI)SIG output alternative
An alternative with better efficiency could be to use bare
OP_CHECK(MULTI)SIG outputs to hold the nonce pubkey - generally a second
output is needed anyway for change. The most simple would be to use Jeff
Garzik's OP_DROP proposal(5) for the prefix:
   DROP n ... m CHECKMULTISIG
  or
   DROP  CHECKSIG
The payor pubkey is in the *change* txout, and the payee's ECDH-derived
pubkey in the other txout. By setting the prefix to be the same on both
txouts and using the same basic scriptPubKey form the relationship of
change and payment is still hidden; CoinJoin-using implementations can
adopt even more sophisticated approaches.
If IsStandard() rules remain the same and using OP_DROP is impractical,
we can also grind the change pubkey to match the prefix in a
deterministic manner so the wallet can still be recovered from a seed.
More costly, but maybe still acceptable for reasonably short prefixes.
Either way the result is transactions that are actually smaller and
cheaper than standard transactions, although without the advantage of
pushing scriptPubKey size payment to the receiver. (a pity we didn't
spend the extra time to adopt OP_EVAL)
A disadvantage is that revealing the nonce secret to prove a payment was
made is more problematic - either the txout needs to be spent first, or
we need a CHECKMULTISIG.
* Address format
To be decided. To support mulisig we probably want the ability to
specify n-of-m master pubkeys, using the nonce to generate derived ones.
For the single pubkey case the addresses will be a little longer than
standard Bitcoin addresses:

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Announces Charges Against Bitcoin Exchangers,
Including Ceo Of Bitcoin Exchange Company, For Scheme To Sell And Launder
Over $1 Million In Bitcoins Related To Silk Road Drug Trafficking
*FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE*
 Monday, January 27, 2014
*Defendants Sold Bitcoins to be Used to Buy and Sell Illegal Drugs
Anonymously on the Silk Road Drug Trafficking Website*
Preet Bharara, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New
York, James J. Hunt, the Acting Special-Agent-in-Charge of the New York
Field Division of the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”), and Toni
Weirauch, the Special Agent-in-Charge of the New York Field Office of the
Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigation (“IRS-CI”), announced the
unsealing of criminal charges in Manhattan federal court against ROBERT M.
FAIELLA, a/k/a “BTCKing,” an underground Bitcoin exchanger, and CHARLIE
SHREM, the Chief Executive Officer and Compliance Officer of a Bitcoin
exchange company, for engaging in a scheme to sell over $1 million in
Bitcoins to users of “Silk Road,” the underground website that enabled its
users to buy and sell illegal drugs anonymously and beyond the reach of law
enforcement. Each defendant is charged with conspiring to commit money
laundering, and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. SHREM
is also charged with willfully failing to file any suspicious activity
report regarding FAIELLA’s illegal transactions through the Company, in
violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. SCHREM was arrested yesterday at John F.
Kennedy International Airport in New York, and is expected to be presented
in Manhattan federal court later today before U.S. Magistrate Judge Henry
Pitman. FAIELLA was arrested today at his residence in Cape Coral, Florida,
and is expected to be presented in federal court in the Middle District of
Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: “As alleged, Robert Faiella and
Charlie Shrem schemed to sell over $1 million in Bitcoins to criminals bent
on trafficking narcotics on the dark web drug site, Silk Road. Truly
innovative business models don’t need to resort to old-fashioned
law-breaking, and when Bitcoins, like any traditional currency, are
laundered and used to fuel criminal activity, law enforcement has no choice
but to act. We will aggressively pursue those who would coopt new forms of
currency for illicit purposes.”
DEA Acting Special-Agent-in-Charge James J. Hunt said: “The charges
announced today depict law enforcement's commitment to identifying those
who promote the sale of illegal drugs throughout the world. Hiding behind
their computers, both defendants are charged with knowingly contributing to
and facilitating anonymous drug sales, earning substantial profits along
the way. Drug law enforcement's job is to investigate and identify those
who abet the illicit drug trade at all levels of production and
distribution including those lining their own pockets by feigning ignorance
of any wrong doing and turning a blind eye.”
IRS Special-Agent-in-Charge Toni Weirauch said: “The government has been
successful in swiftly identifying those responsible for the design and
operation of the ‘Silk Road’ website, as well as those who helped ‘Silk
Road’ customers conduct their illegal transactions by facilitating the
conversion of their dollars into Bitcoins. This is yet another example of
the New York Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Strike Force’s proficiency in
applying financial investigative resources to the fight against illegal
According to the allegations contained in the Criminal Complaint unsealed
today in Manhattan federal court:
Bitcoin exchange on the Silk Road website, a website that served as a
sprawling and anonymous black market bazaar where illegal drugs of
virtually every variety were bought and sold regularly by the site’s users.
Operating under the username “BTCKing,” FAIELLA sold Bitcoins – the only
form of payment accepted on Silk Road – to users seeking to buy illegal
drugs on the site. Upon receiving orders for Bitcoins from Silk Road users,
he filled the orders through a company based in New York, New York (the
“Company”). The Company was designed to enable customers to exchange cash
for Bitcoins anonymously, that is, without providing any personal
identifying information, and it charged a fee for its service. FAIELLA
obtained Bitcoins with the Company’s assistance, and then sold the Bitcoins
to Silk Road users at a markup.
SHREM is the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, and from about August
2011 until about July 2013, when the Company ceased operating, he was also
its Compliance Officer, in charge of ensuring the Company’s compliance with
federal and other anti-money laundering (“AML”) laws. SHREM is also the
Vice Chairman of a foundation dedicated to promoting the Bitcoin virtual
currency system.
SHREM, who personally bought drugs on Silk Road, was fully aware that Silk
Road was a drug-trafficking website, and through his communications with
FAIELLA, SHREM also knew that FAIELLA was operating a Bitcoin exchange
service for Silk Road users. Nevertheless, SHREM knowingly facilitated
FAIELLA’s business with the Company in order to maintain FAIELLA’s business
as a lucrative source of Company revenue. SHREM knowingly allowed FAIELLA
to use the Company’s services to buy Bitcoins for his Silk Road customers;
personally processed FAIELLA’s orders; gave FAIELLA discounts on his
high-volume transactions; failed to file a single suspicious activity
report with the United States Treasury Department about FAIELLA’s illicit
activity, as he was otherwise required to do in his role as the Company’s
Compliance Officer; and deliberately helped FAIELLA circumvent the
Company’s AML restrictions, even though it was SHREM’s job to enforce them
and even though the Company had registered with the Treasury Department as
a money services business.
Working together, SHREM and FAIELLA exchanged over $1 million in cash for
Bitcoins for the benefit of Silk Road users, so that the users could, in
turn, make illegal purchases on Silk Road.
In late 2012, when the Company stopped accepting cash payments, FAIELLA
ceased doing business with the Company and temporarily shut down his
illegal Bitcoin exchange service on Silk Road. FAIELLA resumed operating on
Silk Road in April 2013 without the Company’s assistance, and continued to
exchange tens of thousands of dollars a week in Bitcoins until the Silk
Road website was shut down by law enforcement in October 2013.
*                      *                      *
FAIELLA, 52, of Cape Coral, Florida, and SHREM, 24, of New York, New York,
are each charged with one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering,
which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, and one count of
operating an unlicensed money transmitting business, which carries a
maximum sentence of five years in prison. SHREM is also charged with one
count of willful failure to file a suspicious activity report, which
carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison.
Mr. Bharara praised the outstanding investigative work of the DEA’s New
York Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Strike Force, which is comprised of
agents and officers of the U. S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the New
York City Police Department, Immigration and Customs Enforcement - Homeland
Security Investigations, the New York State Police, the U. S. Internal
Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives,
U.S. Secret Service, the U.S. Marshal Service, New York National Guard,
Office of Foreign Assets Control and the New York Department of Taxation
and Finance. Mr. Bharara also thanked the FBI’s New York Field Office.
Mr. Bharara also noted that the investigation remains ongoing.
The prosecution of this case is being handled by the Office’s Complex
Frauds Unit. Assistant United States Attorney Serrin Turner is in charge of
the prosecution, and Assistant United States Attorney Andrew Adams of the
Asset Forfeiture Unit is in charge of the forfeiture aspects of the case.
The charges contained in the Complaint are merely accusations, and the
defendants are presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty.

If You Used This Secure Webmail Site, the FBI Has Your Inbox
   - By Kevin Poulsen
   - 01.27.14
   - 6:30 AM
While investigating a hosting company known for sheltering child porn last
year the FBI incidentally seized the entire e-mail database of a popular
anonymous webmail service called TorMail.
Now the FBI is tapping that vast trove of e-mail in unrelated
The bureau's data windfall, seized from a company called Freedom Hosting,
surfaced in court papers last week when prosecutors indicted a Florida man
for allegedly selling counterfeit credit cards online. The filings show the
FBI built its case in part by executing a search warrant on a Gmail account
used by the counterfeiters, where they found that orders for forged cards
were being sent to a TorMail e-mail account: "platplus at tormail.net."
Acting on that lead in September, the FBI obtained a search warrant for the
TorMail account, and then accessed it from the bureau's own copy of "data
and information from the TorMail e-mail server, including the content of
TorMail e-mail accounts," according to the
sworn out by U.S. Postal Inspector Eric Malecki.
The tactic suggests the FBI is adapting to the age of big-data with an
NSA-style collect-everything approach, gathering information into a virtual
lock box, and leaving it there until it can obtain specific authority to
tap it later. There's no indication that the FBI searched the trove for
incriminating evidence before getting a warrant. But now that it has a copy
of TorMail's servers, the bureau can execute endless search warrants on a
mail service that once boasted of being immune to spying.
"We have no information to give you or to respond to any subpoenas or court
orders," read TorMail's homepage. "Do not bother contacting us for
information on, or to view the contents of a TorMail user inbox, you will
be ignored."
In another e-mail case, the FBI last year won a court order compelling
secure e-mail provider Lavabit to turn over the master encryption
its website, which would have given agents the technical ability to
on all of Lavabit's 400,000 users - though the government said it was
interested only in one. (Rather than comply, Lavabit shut down and is
appealing the surveillance order).
TorMail was the webmail provider of choice for denizens of the so-called
Darknet  of anonymous and
encrypted websites and services, making the FBI's cache extraordinarily
valuable. The affair also sheds a little more light on the already-strange
story of the FBI's broad attack on Freedom Hosting, once a key service
provider for untraceable websites.
Freedom Hosting specialized in providing turnkey "Tor hidden service" sites

Sad to see this go. Judging by some of the comments on /r/onions, I think
most of the community didn't quite get it, and saw your project as less of
a political tool and more like something akin to sports betting. Subtlety
is a dead art.
Now crowd funding is a main-stream thing, I think you have to look at other
successful crowd funded campaigns and platforms to see what works and what
doesn't. People are more likely to give to individual campaigns rather than
general causes, I think DPL may have been a bit too open-ended. I took a
stab at something similar but it never got very far off the ground, but
perhaps you'd want to talk about picking the pieces up? From my

@_subject: CITIZENFOUR 
Saw this last night - an obvious must-watch for all CPunks. I think it was
probably the most important documentary film of all time. As Roger Ebert
said, "it’s as if Daniel Ellsberg had a friend with a movie camera who
filmed his disclosure of the Pentagon Papers every step of the way. Or if
the Watergate burglars had taken along a filmmaker who shot their crimes
and the cover-up that followed. Except that the issues “Citizenfour” deals
with are, arguably, a thousand times more potent than Vietnam or
Watergate." Truly, this is the Snowden story we have been waiting for since
The main revelation of the film, however, is what an incredible boob Glenn
Greenwald is. I had some idea of this after seeing him give an extremely
disappointing talk earlier this year, but I don't think I quite understood
how useless this guy really is. He's constantly asking the wrong questions,
displays a technical ineptness (to the point of deliberate ignorance) that
obviously hampers the journalism, and at very step shows a very clear
desire to keep the document cache to himself for careerist purposes. At one
point Ewen MacAskill brings up the idea of there being a Wikileaks-esque
document explorer, and Ed says that this would be the best outcome for the
documents, and Greenwald quickly dismisses the idea to talk about his
publishing schedule. I still have immense respect for him, but I found it
very frustrating and quite cringey to watch him treat the whole event in
news-cycle terms, while everybody around him is obviously thinking in
historical context. For instance, there is a moment when they are prepping
for Ed's first on-camera interview and he asks the reporters how much
background he should give about himself, and they give different answers.
Poitras asks for as much detail as possible, and Greenwald basically says
that isn't important, just be short so we get a good soundbite.
More importantly, I think the film also misses an opportunity to talk about
*power*. This is something Edward himself has addressed, but it isn't
really covered in Greenwald's reporting or books, and the only time it's
mentioned in the film is when Jacob Appelbaum, while speaking before a
European council of some sort, quite astutely comments that surveillance
and control are one and the same. I think the film should probably have
spent another hour or so investigating, naming and confronting those who
profit from that control. Other than a few choice C-SPAN snippets, the
enemy is completely faceless, which plays well for the pervading sense
paranoia which envelops the film, but also leaves many questions unasked.
Perhaps that's left as an exercise for the viewer, but I think the general
take-away message from both the reporting and to a slightly lesser extent
the film is that any "solution" will be token reform of policy and not
dismantlement of power structures.
Also, very nice of the Russian government to let Ed have his girlfriend
back. I didn't know that had happened, and it gives a rather unexpected
happy ending to a film which otherwise made me want to cry desperately.
Anyway, I'd be very interested to hear what you lot thought of it. (JY, you
should throw a torrent up ASAP! I'm sure people will be screenshotting and
analyzing all of the new document shots the film contains.)

@_subject: Internet Scale Forensic Traffic Correlation 
Have we seen any evidence of the ability of the NSA/FIVEEYES to do internet
or national scale retroactive traffic correlation? Not just for Tor exit
nodes, but for any arbitrary connection.
For instance, if I upload a 64.32Kb exploit to a server, and they know
forensically that the exploit arrived at 12:01:01PM, do they have the
capability to see all connections, internet-wide, which sent ~64.32Kb of
data within the previous, say, ~500-2000ms? (A useful capability for
anybody trying van paedos behind 7 proxies, but bad news for hackers,
junkies and other weirdos.)
Technical details around this capability would be very useful for designing
high-latency and chaff-based anonymity tools. Ex, a global chaff network to
cover a given byte-size range, steganographic proxies, etc.
Another one to add to the list of "if you happen to have access access to
the Snowden cache, please set this information free" requests (along with
any info compiler backdoors, KH-13, operating system backdoors, transit
cards, cryptocurrencies, burners, advertising industry partners, Oracle,
Narus, etc etc etc..).

No PoC published yet, but interesting work on a new high speed router based
anonymity network.
"We present HORNET, a system that enables high-speed end-to-end anonymous
channels by leveraging next generation network archi-tectures. HORNET is
designed as a low-latency onion routing system that operates at the network
layer thus enabling a wide ra nge of applications. Our system uses only
symmetric cryptography for data forwarding yet requires no per-flow state
on intermediate nodes. This design enables HORNET nodes to process
anonymous traffic at over 93 Gb/s. HORNET can also scale as required,
adding minimal processing overhead per additional anonymous channel. We
discuss design and implementation details, as well as a performance and
security evaluation."
Another subtle but slightly interesting tweak to the threat model in
post-Snowden anonymity papers - increased difficultly of upholding a global
political conspiracy is now explicitly mentioned as layer of defense (7.3).

data within the previous, say, ~500-2000ms? (A useful capability for
anybody trying van paedos behind 7 proxies, but bad news for hackers,
junkies and other weirdos.)
Technical details around this capability would be very useful for designing
high-latency and chaff-based anonymity tools. Ex, a global chaff network to
cover a given byte-size range, steganographic proxies, etc.
Another one to add to the list of "if you happen to have access access to
the Snowden cache, please set this information free" requests (along with
any info compiler backdoors, KH-13, operating system backdoors, transit
cards, cryptocurrencies, burners, advertising industry partners, Oracle,
Narus, etc etc etc..).
Pretty please, massa Greenwald?

@_subject: HORNET: High-speed Onion Routing at the Network Layer 
No PoC published yet, but interesting work on a new high speed router based
anonymity network.
"We present HORNET, a system that enables high-speed end-to-end anonymous
channels by leveraging next generation network archi-tectures. HORNET is
designed as a low-latency onion routing system that operates at the network
layer thus enabling a wide ra nge of applications. Our system uses only
symmetric cryptography for data forwarding yet requires no per-flow state
on intermediate nodes. This design enables HORNET nodes to process
anonymous traffic at over 93 Gb/s. HORNET can also scale as required,
adding minimal processing overhead per additional anonymous channel. We
discuss design and implementation details, as well as a performance and
security evaluation."
Another subtle but slightly interesting tweak to the threat model in
post-Snowden anonymity papers - increased difficultly of upholding a global
political conspiracy is now explicitly mentioned as layer of defense (7.3).

@_subject: Internet Scale Forensic Traffic Correlation 
Have we seen any evidence of the ability of the NSA/FIVEEYES to do internet
or national scale retroactive traffic correlation? Not just for Tor exit
nodes, but for any arbitrary connection.
For instance, if I upload a 64.32Kb exploit to a server, and they know
forensically that the exploit arrived at 12:01:01PM, do they have the
capability to see all connections, internet-wide, which sent ~64.32Kb of
data within the previous, say, ~500-2000ms? (A useful capability for

Where in the stack are you attacking?
For behavior, consult old Phracks on neuro-lingustic programming. A brush
of the hair, a touch of the elbow, anything that builds rapport and makes
the mirror neurons light up. Simple tricks used by street magicians and
con-artists - script kiddies of the mind. Only works against soft targets.
Below behavior, ideology. Surprised to see religion and states listed here
- both applications consuming the API of currency. Have enough money - or
appear to - and anything can be leveraged. Belief in the value of currency
is universal. Riyals, dollars, euros, bitcoin, shiny rocks and gems, common
stock, Yazidi slaves, it doesn't matter - given the right amount of the
right commodity, you can get what you want. Even easier if it's not real -
counterfeit bills, gold paint, or better yet fake commas on a screen.
Transfer complete, here is your passphrase.
Below ideology, biology. Dopamine pathways can be trained to respond to
stimuli without ever leaving kernelspace. Salt, fat, cum, phenethylamines,
sucrose. With the right amount of give and take, control is as easy as
ringing a bell.
And if your target is an asexual billionaire vegan with a TA-CD vaccination?
The answer is simple - scopolamine and DMSO.
