First trillionaire: In 25 yrs Bill Gates’ wealth to be half of Indian GDP
Updated: Jan 25, 2017 10:33 IST
Microsoft founder Bill Gates, of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
gestures during a session of the World Economic Forum(AFP)
Bill Gates, the co-founder of technology behemoth Microsoft, is on track
to become the world’s first trillionaire, according to a report by
Oxfam, the England-headquartered confederation of charitable
organizations focused on the alleviation of global poverty.
To put things in perspective, the total gross domestic product of
Indonesia is less than a trillion dollar. That means Gates as a
trillionaire would have more wealth than what Indonesia produces in
goods and services in one year.
India, too, has a skewed proportion of wealthy people. The report quoted
that Swiss global financial services company, UBS estimates that in the
next 20 years, 500 people will hand over $2.1 trillion to their heirs, a
tad less than the GDP of India, a country where 1.3 billion people live.
Gates’ fortunes has risen by 50%, or $25 billion since he left Microsoft
in 2006, “despite his efforts to donate much of its in charity,” the
report said.
Gates runs the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which works to improve
education, world health and population, and around community giving.
In the 10 years after Gates took up social work, his net worth has grown
to $75 billion. The Forbes magazine calculates his net worth at $84 billion.
“If billionaires continue to secure these returns, we could see the
world’s first trillionaire in 25 years. In such an environment, if you
are already rich you have to try hard not to keep getting a lot richer,”
the report elaborated.
The flipside: the huge fortunes in the hand of few is a “clear evidence
of inequality crisis”, and is hindering the “fight to end extreme poverty”.
India, too, has a skewed proportion of wealthy people. The report quoted

The US even ignored it's own 'Rebels" eyewitness account. They claimed
it was an SU-22 that hit the building containing the CWD. That aircraft
isn't normally capable of carrying CWDs and I SERIOUSLY DOUBT the
Russians would give the SAF the proper mounts to do so, even if
available. I'm also VERY SKEPTICAL that the CW agent was Sarin. There's
loads of pics of USAID's "White Helmets" handing the victims without
even gloves on yet no reports of sick or dead 'helmets', and initial
reports coming out of Idlib passed on by regional twitter accounts at
the time claimed it was probably Chlorine.
Nevertheless, this was NOT a "Chemical Attack", it was a "Chemical
Release" from a building under control of the so-called 'rebels' who
were apparently manufacturing CWDs in the vicinity of civilian
populations and the US is using it as a post-facto excuse, by distorting
the facts, for their weeks-old boots-on-Syrian-soil-illegally invasion

I can see faggot fascists doing something like that, and like the US,

Further, US law enforcement agencies also keep a list of images and

I call it hosting. You can call it whatever you want, but if Cloudflare
has an identical near-realtime copy of a site including logs necessary
to duplicate the site's functioning, comments and everything else, it IS
(sic) virtually hosting a site, on standby.
Anyone who thinks a company whose owner got his big biz boost by working
with the feds running "Operation Honeypot", and is apparently allowed to
'protect' ISIS chatrooms without the US government 'disappearing'
cloudflare from the intertubz

I did. and there's no 'if' about it. That's how Cloudflare 'protects'
sites from dDos attacks afaik, by keeping a dynamic real-time copy of
the site and there's some sort of 'sensoring' that detects that the site
protected is under attack and Cloudflare's servers, hosting a dupe of
the site under attack, take over page delivery and interactions.
That's my understanding of how it works. I you know better I'd love to
hear about it.
The POINT IS Cloudflare... They're OBVIOUSLY the goto source for the
Fed's Honeypot needs. Which is why those ISIS chatrooms don't vanish.
Because if the feds said to cloudflare 'vanish them' and cloudflare
didn't, cloudflare would 'vanish'
So what makes you think Sigaint or any of the others 'protected' by them
aren't in jeopardy the second the feds tap them for a 'tap' or logged
data from their protection operation? You think they can't be on
sigaint's "wire" just because 'special' or what?

Today’s ODNI and Section 702 News
By Jennifer Granick
Friday, April 28, 2017 at 7:16 PM
Today, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)
announced that it would stop some of the surveillance it conducts on the
telecommunications backbone under authority granted by section 702 of
the FISA Amendments Act. That announcement came in the form of a press
release, a statement, and was reported in a New York Times article by
reporter Charlie Savage.
Here’s some background, and some questions Congress and the courts are
going to need to answer going forward. (For more information, check out
my book, American Spies, or this series of blog posts (one, two, three)
by Jadzia Butler and I on section 702.
When conducting surveillance of communications as they travel over fiber
optic cables (the “Upstream” program), the NSA has been collecting not
just communications to and from foreign intelligence targets, but also
about those targets. If the stream of internet packets contains a
selector associated with a foreign intelligence target, the NSA has been
acquiring the entire “internet transaction” containing that selector.
This “about” collection means collection takes place even when the
relationship between the communicants and the intended target is
attenuated—no one is talking to the target.
Further, about communications can pull unrelated messages into the NSA’s
coffers. Using this surveillance technique, the government “tasks” a
given selector (such as an email address or phone number) in the stream
of internet data flowing through particular network gateways (known as
the “internet backbone”). If the stream of internet packets contains the
selector, the Upstream program will acquire the entire “internet
transaction” containing that selector. Some transactions only include
one communication (Single Communications Transactions – SCT’s), while
others contain multiple discreet communications (Multiple Communications
Transactions – MCT’s). Because of the way the NSA conducts Upstream
collection, if any communication within an SCT or MCT is “to,” “from,”
or even “about” a tasked selector, the entire transaction is collected.
The collection of MCT’s further removes the nexus between the
communicants and the intended target because any communication that is
embedded within a transaction that happens to include a communication
that so much as mentions the targeted selector can get swept up.
Despite the fact that this type of surveillance has been taking place
since 2001, and that it was supposed to be regulated and overseen by the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) since 2008, it was only
in 2011 that the NSA acknowledged “about” collection and the MCT problem
to the FISC. (The public learned about it after revelations based on
documents from whistleblower Edward Snowden.) The FISC judge, John
Bates, allowed the collection to go forward despite his initial finding
that the collection violated the Fourth Amendment. Judge Bates accepted
NSA proposed post-collection usage rules, called minimization
procedures. The NSA adopted rules for Upstream surveillance that require
it to treat MCTs as a special category. The NSA was supposed to put
special procedures in place designed to identify when a communication
within an MCT is between American citizens.
MCTs were to be screened for irrelevant information, which must be
deleted. No agency but the NSA is supposed to have access to MCTs, not
the CIA or the FBI.
Judge Bates likely accepted this band aid despite the constitutional
problems because the NSA claimed it was not capable of breaking MCTs
down into individual messages, not capable of stopping “about”
collection, and insisted that this surveillance capability was
protecting the nation from terrorists.
ODNI reports that NSA will no longer collect certain internet
communications that merely mention a foreign intelligence target. The
NSA will delete the vast majority of its upstream internet data to
further protect the privacy of U.S. person communications. Further, the
changes in policy followed an in-house review of Section 702 activities
in which NSA discovered “several inadvertent compliance lapses.” The
public is now waiting for a declassified FISC opinion explaining these
issues in more detail.
In other words, today we learned that those 2011 safeguards did not
work, the NSA can stop about collection, and that our counterterrorism
efforts can live without this massive invasion of privacy.
In other words…Wow.
Here are some questions that the courts and Congress will need to
answer, especially since section 702 is due to expire at the end of this
year, and Americans must decide whether to renew the program, and if so,
with what safeguards in place.
The ODNI press release is unclear about whether or not NSA is ceasing
all “about” collection, or just that where one of the communicants is an
American. The press release says “the Agency will stop the practice to
reduce the chance that it would acquire communications of U.S. persons
or others who are not in direct contact with a foreign intelligence
target.” So, you could read that as both one end foreign and
international communication. Or, it could mean stopping collection of
only one end foreign, and the word “others” refers to those non-citizens
communicating with USPs but not with other foreigners. The statement
says “surveillance will now be limited to only those communications that
are directly “to” or “from” a foreign intelligence target.” That sounds
more comprehensive. However, if ODNI is using “surveillance” to mean
electronic surveillance as defined in the FISA then they may still be
doing “about” collection on foreign to foreign communications. Word
games can make it very hard to understand exactly what official
statements mean.
It appears that the NSA now has and maybe has always had a way to filter
out Americans’ international communications from Upstream, despite
multiple statements to the contrary.
If they can filter statements out, that suggests ODNI can count how many
communications in the take are to or from Americans.
You should read “several inadvertent compliance lapses” as “systematic
violations of the Fourth Amendment”. Remember that these minimization
procedures were required by Judge Bates to ameliorate constitutional
violations. Failure to follow those rules is a failure to comply with
the Fourth Amendment.
Given the problems that came to light in 2011 and then again now, has
section 702 ever been used lawfully?
ODNI admits today that they are using section 702 for “cybersecurity”.
That is a topic that the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board did
not study. We do not know anything about how selectors are chosen for
cybersecurity, or what the resulting database of information looks like.
While figuring out this problem, the FISC did not let section 702
collection lapse, but extended existing certifications beyond the year
expiration period. Under what authority could a FISC judge do this?
NSA is deleting the about collection data they have. That means that
they cannot find a way to use it in accordance with the 2011 Bates opinion.
I think this statement marks a change for the better in the way that the
ODNI talks about counterterrorism:
    NSA previously reported that, because of the limits of its current
technology, it is unable to completely eliminate “about” communications
from its upstream 702 collection without also excluding some of the
relevant communications directly “to or from” its foreign intelligence
targets. That limitation remains even today. Nonetheless, NSA has
determined that in light of the factors noted, this change is a
responsible and careful approach at this time.
Today, the NSA agrees that blindly Collecting It All is not necessarily
the right thing to do. Responsible surveillance takes into account civil
liberties as well. That is big news indeed.

First trillionaire: In 25 yrs Bill Gates’ wealth to be half of Indian GDP
Updated: Jan 25, 2017 10:33 IST
Microsoft founder Bill Gates, of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
gestures during a session of the World Economic Forum(AFP)
Bill Gates, the co-founder of technology behemoth Microsoft, is on track
to become the world’s first trillionaire, according to a report by
Oxfam, the England-headquartered confederation of charitable
organizations focused on the alleviation of global poverty.
To put things in perspective, the total gross domestic product of
Indonesia is less than a trillion dollar. That means Gates as a
trillionaire would have more wealth than what Indonesia produces in
goods and services in one year.
India, too, has a skewed proportion of wealthy people. The report quoted
that Swiss global financial services company, UBS estimates that in the
next 20 years, 500 people will hand over $2.1 trillion to their heirs, a
tad less than the GDP of India, a country where 1.3 billion people live.
Gates’ fortunes has risen by 50%, or $25 billion since he left Microsoft
in 2006, “despite his efforts to donate much of its in charity,” the
report said.
Gates runs the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which works to improve
education, world health and population, and around community giving.
In the 10 years after Gates took up social work, his net worth has grown
to $75 billion. The Forbes magazine calculates his net worth at $84 billion.
“If billionaires continue to secure these returns, we could see the
world’s first trillionaire in 25 years. In such an environment, if you
are already rich you have to try hard not to keep getting a lot richer,”
the report elaborated.
The flipside: the huge fortunes in the hand of few is a “clear evidence
of inequality crisis”, and is hindering the “fight to end extreme poverty”.
India, too, has a skewed proportion of wealthy people. The report quoted

The US even ignored it's own 'Rebels" eyewitness account. They claimed
it was an SU-22 that hit the building containing the CWD. That aircraft

Nevertheless, this was NOT a "Chemical Attack", it was a "Chemical

were apparently manufacturing CWDs in the vicinity of civilian
populations and the US is using it as a post-facto excuse, by distorting

protected is under attack and Cloudflare's servers, hosting a dupe of
the site under attack, take over page delivery and interactions.
That's my understanding of how it works. I you know better I'd love to

The POINT IS Cloudflare... They're OBVIOUSLY the goto source for the

Because if the feds said to cloudflare 'vanish them' and cloudflare

So what makes you think Sigaint or any of the others 'protected' by them

Today’s ODNI and Section 702 News
By Jennifer Granick
Friday, April 28, 2017 at 7:16 PM
Today, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI)
announced that it would stop some of the surveillance it conducts on the
telecommunications backbone under authority granted by section 702 of
the FISA Amendments Act. That announcement came in the form of a press
release, a statement, and was reported in a New York Times article by
reporter Charlie Savage.
Here’s some background, and some questions Congress and the courts are
going to need to answer going forward. (For more information, check out
my book, American Spies, or this series of blog posts (one, two, three)
by Jadzia Butler and I on section 702.
When conducting surveillance of communications as they travel over fiber
optic cables (the “Upstream” program), the NSA has been collecting not
just communications to and from foreign intelligence targets, but also
about those targets. If the stream of internet packets contains a
selector associated with a foreign intelligence target, the NSA has been
acquiring the entire “internet transaction” containing that selector.
This “about” collection means collection takes place even when the
relationship between the communicants and the intended target is
attenuated—no one is talking to the target.
Further, about communications can pull unrelated messages into the NSA’s
coffers. Using this surveillance technique, the government “tasks” a
given selector (such as an email address or phone number) in the stream
of internet data flowing through particular network gateways (known as
the “internet backbone”). If the stream of internet packets contains the
selector, the Upstream program will acquire the entire “internet
transaction” containing that selector. Some transactions only include
one communication (Single Communications Transactions – SCT’s), while
others contain multiple discreet communications (Multiple Communications
Transactions – MCT’s). Because of the way the NSA conducts Upstream
collection, if any communication within an SCT or MCT is “to,” “from,”
or even “about” a tasked selector, the entire transaction is collected.
The collection of MCT’s further removes the nexus between the
communicants and the intended target because any communication that is
embedded within a transaction that happens to include a communication
that so much as mentions the targeted selector can get swept up.
Despite the fact that this type of surveillance has been taking place
since 2001, and that it was supposed to be regulated and overseen by the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) since 2008, it was only
in 2011 that the NSA acknowledged “about” collection and the MCT problem
to the FISC. (The public learned about it after revelations based on
documents from whistleblower Edward Snowden.) The FISC judge, John
Bates, allowed the collection to go forward despite his initial finding
that the collection violated the Fourth Amendment. Judge Bates accepted
NSA proposed post-collection usage rules, called minimization
procedures. The NSA adopted rules for Upstream surveillance that require
it to treat MCTs as a special category. The NSA was supposed to put
special procedures in place designed to identify when a communication
within an MCT is between American citizens.
MCTs were to be screened for irrelevant information, which must be
deleted. No agency but the NSA is supposed to have access to MCTs, not
the CIA or the FBI.
Judge Bates likely accepted this band aid despite the constitutional
problems because the NSA claimed it was not capable of breaking MCTs
down into individual messages, not capable of stopping “about”
collection, and insisted that this surveillance capability was
protecting the nation from terrorists.
ODNI reports that NSA will no longer collect certain internet
communications that merely mention a foreign intelligence target. The
NSA will delete the vast majority of its upstream internet data to
further protect the privacy of U.S. person communications. Further, the
changes in policy followed an in-house review of Section 702 activities
in which NSA discovered “several inadvertent compliance lapses.” The
public is now waiting for a declassified FISC opinion explaining these
issues in more detail.
In other words, today we learned that those 2011 safeguards did not
work, the NSA can stop about collection, and that our counterterrorism
efforts can live without this massive invasion of privacy.
In other words…Wow.
Here are some questions that the courts and Congress will need to
answer, especially since section 702 is due to expire at the end of this
year, and Americans must decide whether to renew the program, and if so,
with what safeguards in place.
The ODNI press release is unclear about whether or not NSA is ceasing
all “about” collection, or just that where one of the communicants is an
American. The press release says “the Agency will stop the practice to
reduce the chance that it would acquire communications of U.S. persons
or others who are not in direct contact with a foreign intelligence
target.” So, you could read that as both one end foreign and
international communication. Or, it could mean stopping collection of
only one end foreign, and the word “others” refers to those non-citizens
communicating with USPs but not with other foreigners. The statement
says “surveillance will now be limited to only those communications that
are directly “to” or “from” a foreign intelligence target.” That sounds
more comprehensive. However, if ODNI is using “surveillance” to mean
electronic surveillance as defined in the FISA then they may still be
doing “about” collection on foreign to foreign communications. Word
games can make it very hard to understand exactly what official
statements mean.
It appears that the NSA now has and maybe has always had a way to filter
out Americans’ international communications from Upstream, despite
multiple statements to the contrary.
If they can filter statements out, that suggests ODNI can count how many
communications in the take are to or from Americans.
You should read “several inadvertent compliance lapses” as “systematic
violations of the Fourth Amendment”. Remember that these minimization
procedures were required by Judge Bates to ameliorate constitutional
violations. Failure to follow those rules is a failure to comply with
the Fourth Amendment.
Given the problems that came to light in 2011 and then again now, has
section 702 ever been used lawfully?
ODNI admits today that they are using section 702 for “cybersecurity”.
That is a topic that the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board did
not study. We do not know anything about how selectors are chosen for
cybersecurity, or what the resulting database of information looks like.
While figuring out this problem, the FISC did not let section 702
collection lapse, but extended existing certifications beyond the year
expiration period. Under what authority could a FISC judge do this?
NSA is deleting the about collection data they have. That means that
they cannot find a way to use it in accordance with the 2011 Bates opinion.
I think this statement marks a change for the better in the way that the
ODNI talks about counterterrorism:
    NSA previously reported that, because of the limits of its current
technology, it is unable to completely eliminate “about” communications
from its upstream 702 collection without also excluding some of the
relevant communications directly “to or from” its foreign intelligence
targets. That limitation remains even today. Nonetheless, NSA has
determined that in light of the factors noted, this change is a
responsible and careful approach at this time.
Today, the NSA agrees that blindly Collecting It All is not necessarily
the right thing to do. Responsible surveillance takes into account civil
liberties as well. That is big news indeed.

@_subject: House Judiciary Committee taps /r/The_Donald subreddit for Amended 
The House Judiciary Committee has a unique role to play in times of
great national crisis in the functioning of the presidency. As the
congressional body with jurisdiction over the initial stages of the
impeachment process, it’s the committee’s responsibility to weigh
whether the president’s misconduct is sufficiently severe so as to merit
what Charles Black refers to as “this most drastic of measures.”
Fortunately, Chairman Bob Goodlatte and the Republican members of his
committee are up to the task. Last week, with Russia matters heating up
and the White House in full meltdown, they stayed focused on the real
danger at hand: Huma Abedin.
The committee voted to adopt an amended resolution introduced by
Representative Matt Gaetz (R-FL) calling for a special counsel
investigation into, variously, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s
instructions to former FBI Director James Comey to refer to the Clinton
email probe as a “matter” rather than an “investigation”; Comey’s leaks
to Columbia University law professor Daniel Richman; Comey’s leaks to
New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt as far back as 1993 (when
Schmidt, who graduated college in 2005, would have been around ten years
old); “collusion” between Comey and Robert Mueller; any knowledge by
Comey of the Steele dossier and of efforts by the intelligence community
to surveill Trump or unmask his associates in a quest to damage Trump’s
campaign or his presidency; immunity deals provided by the FBI to
various Clinton aides over the course of the email investigation;
whether Clinton secretly approved a deal to transfer U.S. uranium
deposits to Russian control in return for donations to the Clinton
Foundation; and yes, the specific circumstances of Huma Abedin’s
employment at the State Department.
If this sounds like the work of conspiracy theorists, that’s because
that’s exactly what it is. Wired reported on Friday that a Gaetz staffer
appears to have crowdsourced the amended resolution with the help of
r/The_Donald, a pro-Trump subreddit notorious for both its embrace of
conspiracy theories and its gleeful offensiveness. The Reddit user,
“Devinm666,” regularly posted on the forum praising Gaetz, referencing
his work in Congress, and at one point publishing a picture of his
congressional ID badge with his name and face blacked out. According to
Wired, Gaetz confirmed that “Devinm666” is Devin Murphy, a legislative
aide in his office.
“I work for Congress and have been asked to come up with a list of
Clinton/Obama/election scandals for my boss ASAP,” Murphy apparently
posted on Reddit, asking for suggestions. “This is not a shitpost. This
is real. Congressional investigation. Do it for America!”
So r/The_Donald rose to the occasion and did it for America.
The text in question is not a bill, but rather a resolution of inquiry.
If passed by the House, it wouldn’t require the Attorney General to
begin a special counsel investigation running in parallel with Robert
Mueller’s investigation (and possibly branching into it in order to
investigate Mueller himself), but would merely “express the sense of the
House of Representatives that a special counsel should be appointed.”
That may be for the best, as there is already an investigation into a
number of the issues listed in the resolution by the Department of
Justice Inspector General. Additionally, most of the offenses fail to
measure up to the standards for a special counsel appointment set out in
either the Department of Justice regulations or the now-defunct
independent counsel statute, which both anticipate possible violations
of criminal law.
This procedural note on Gaetz’s call for a special counsel—its technical
status as a resolution of inquiry, rather than a bill—is key to
understanding how it came to exist in the first place. On July 14th,
Representative Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and David Cicilline (D-RI) of the
House Judiciary Committee introduced a resolution requesting that the
Department of Justice provide Congress with various documents relevant
to the firing of James Comey. After the committee took up the
resolution, Rep. Gaetz introduced an amendment to scoop out the content
and replace it with Gaetz’s request for a special counsel, while keeping
Jayapal and Cicilline’s names on top. Gaetz’s proposal was adopted with
the full support of the committee’s majority.
Though Gaetz’s amendment and the majority’s vote were within the letter
of House procedures, Democrats on the committee are—to put it
mildly—somewhat put out by what they view as a “hijacking” of the normal
But who can blame the majority? With the Mueller investigation
continuing apace and the presidency spiraling ever further into chaos,
you wouldn’t want a responsible body of congressional oversight to get
distracted from what’s really important. Good thing the majority can
boot up Reddit.

For instance. Nazis, by definition, have a really perverse christian

What WOULD the Zombie Jesus do?
Nazis are by definition fascists, and there's ... oh lets say 14,

corollary to those 14 in that Nazis believes White Christians are the
"Master Race", and black folks, like Jews and everyone else, are

Fuck Graeber and everything he ever wrote. Even if he has any valid
thesis it's not an original thought and I can find similar elsewhere.
Hes a hack.
For the record, Graeber's not a historian. He's an anthropologist, a
degree which which admittedly requires a good understanding of history,
but it's not the same educational regimen, and certainly doesn't share
the same goals, as being a historian. Anthropologists are prone to
'making shit up'. Historians have a bit of a harder time doing that.
Speculation isn't encouraged.
If you look at where he's employed,  the London School of Economics. and
his tenure at Yale (the CIA's recruiting grounds), it's easy to discern
he's a literal fraud as a progressive OR anarchist
Graeber was one of the people who hijacked Occupy and totally perverted
it's intent, and he now totally perverts the meaning and intent of the
word "Anarchist" by being a fanboy of the Syrian Kurd YPG and it's
militia, who are actively and knowingly colluding with an imperial
nation, the US, for a PIECE OF EARTH, AND BORDERS!
Whose long-held dream? It would seem, as with most tribal groups
untampered by "anthropologists' like Graeber, the Kurds as a society are
happiest right where they are, in their ancestral lands, un-restrained
or hampered by other's territorial desires. Part of their problem
historically is they've been murderous assholes, so passage to just
about anywhere has historically been blocked by people hostile to them.
Then the nation-states came, and like the Roma in Europe, they're "just
in the way" of territorial expansion by those nations. But I don't feel
sorry for them. They're right in there with Bandera of Ukraine, and the
Jewish mercenaries of Irgun, both of which collaborated with the NAZIS,
for a piece of land, hedging their bet that the Germans might win WWII.
Graeber also forced the progressive faction of the Democratic Party down
everyone's throats at OWS by colluding with a cabal of media-savvy
status-seekers to modify the voting system at general assemblies,
re-interpreting the "Block" to essentially mean you voted yourself out
of the process, when the "Block" was intended to STOP the process until
some overwhelmingly wrong issue was resolved. Because democracy is
SUPPOSED TO move slowly towards a goal, to avoid mistakes that might
terminate that democracy. And it did. It meant all the prog-libs could
'pack' the general assemblies and vote in their interest, instead of
occupy's. And when it disbanded, they MARKETED IT, as if the owned some
brand. Occupy Credit Cards, Bumper Stickers for your french-fry diesel SUV.

Didn't think so.
Yeah yeah. That's what they say, usually correctly (albeit the Ukraine
Fascists in power ARE Nazis) about the word NAZI in relation to
historical events, but Fascism IS ETERNAL, The definition is right here:
All 14 traits.
14. You don't like it? start delineating more and get back to me:
spam at bitbucket.nul
The Nazi ideology is a christian identity ideology that believes, in a
very un-christian way, that anyone not of their ETHNIC BACKGROUND is
literally sub-human. Zionist share that trait when they say moronic shit
like "A Palestinian life isn't worth a Jewish fingernail".
Ukraine IS a fascist nation whose leaders have roots in their family's
historical siding with the NAZIS during WWII. You might note they're
slightly stoopid because the Nazis threw their guiding light Bandera in
prison. It would have saved his modern day believers a lot of trouble if
the Nazis had offed him, making the Nazi Fascist belief system a little
less palatable. They would simply be virulent, murderous, nationalists.
Actually, they're NEVER going to own it. Their forebearers allegedly
did, and it seems they REALLY fucked up. So this time the big mythical
banana said they could LIVE IN IT, if certain condition were met.
I do not believe they've ever met, or intend to ever meet those conditions.
But you see, they may have "Jewish blood" by birth, or conversion, but
The Zionists in Israel aren't "Jews". They're christian ethic-d and
moral-d Europeans and North American invaders (europeans) re-settled. It
has to do with Worldview. Like all indigenous people everywhere,
bloodlines are not the only thing that qualifies one.

Radiohead hides ZX Spectrum proggie in OK Computer re-release
Unclear if code was first mistaken for avant garde instrumental
By Simon Sharwood, APAC Editor
17 Jul 2017 at 07:27
Rock deities Radiohead have snuck a program for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum
into a re-release of their seminal 1997 album “OK Computer”.
Dubbed “OKNOTOK”, the re-release can be had as £100/US$130/€120 boxed
edition that includes three vinyl records, books galore and “a C90
cassette mix tape compiled by us, taken from OK COMPUTER session
archives and demo tapes.”
The Spectrum app resides – natch – on the C90 cassette, as that medium
was the dominant way of storing Speccy programs and data. Accounts of
the cassette's track list suggest it opens with a track named “Zx
sprectrum symphony” but that the application is listed as “Ok Computer
Program” and is the last track on side B.
Buyers quickly identified the track as sounding just like a Spectrum
program's distinctive series of beeps and clicks. Before long clever
folk had ripped the audio and fed it to Spectrum Emulators, producing
the results below.
See site for image:
Radiohead are far from the first band to pull off this trick: The
Stranglers added a game called “Aural Quest” to their 1984 Album Aural
Sculpture. Buzzcock-turned-Homosapien Pete Shelley's second album XL1
included a program that displayed its lyrics on-screen in synch with the
music (With limited success, if your correspondent's 35-year-old
recollections are accurate).
Those efforts appeared at a time the Spectrum was prevalent and popular.
Radiohead's release has proven an education to many, but no surprise to
fans who know well that track five on OK Computer, “Let Down”, featured
sounds produced using a Spectrum. Radiohead guitarist/keyboardist Jonny
Greenwood made those sounds as he is known to have learned to program
the machine.

Gun Control Is “Racist”? The NRA would know
By Adam Winkler
February 4, 2013
National Rifle Association President David Keene stirred controversy
Saturday by insisting that gun control’s origins were racist. “You know,
when you go back in history,” Keene told the Daily Caller, “the initial
wave of [gun laws] was instituted after the Civil War to deny blacks the
ability to defend themselves.” Keene’s history is off by at least
century—gun control existed in the American colonies and in the founding
era—but nonetheless Keene points to an ugly truth about American
history: Gun control has historically been used for racist purposes.
And the NRA’s president should know: His organization was intimately
involved in this history, promoting gun control laws that were tainted
with racism...

It's NOT specifically about speech. By definition anyone who would deny,
or ESPOUSES the denial of someone's right to exist based on some
unalterable feature of their existence like skin color of religion of
birth forfeits not only forfeits their right to 'free speech', they
forfeit the right to exist themselves, because to allow it implies you'd
allow your own self-extermination. In other words you have to
proactively act in  self-defense.
OFC then they claim to be the victims.
Meanwhile the Stormer article that got them bounced from GoDaddy said
(paraphrase) the woman who got run down (a tactic learned from 'islamic
terrorists' btw) was a fat 30-something year old woman who hadn't bred
and therefore she was worthless. What I said above about "ESPOUSES the
denial of someone's right to exist based on..." is operational here.
Also note during the Bundy Bozos Oregon standoff there were adolescents
and teen speaking to a city meeting about the refuge occupation
literally in tears claiming they were in abject fear of the Bundy crew.
In other words. Terrorism. What do we do with terrorists? ESPECIALLY
ones who terrorize CHILDREN?
Death is too good for them. I can't wait to 'victimize' a few affluent

15: The best way to beat a white nationalist is to ask him to sell his
ideology to you in a public setting. Don’t argue with him, just ask him
to describe in public what America would look like if they were in
charge, how they would make that happen, and why it’s something that
people should want.
Ask lots of questions and really press him to explain his vision; make
him describe his entire utopia. Who would have to leave? Where would
they go? Who would get to stay? How would you make that happen? Would
there be DNA tests? Has he taken a DNA test? What precisely is so great
about a white ethnostate? What would happen to food, live music and
entertainment? Once you drag their whole vision out into the light,
there are very few people who would ever find such a vision appealing
enough to try and manifest. It does not sell itself. There’s not much to
say there beyond “Uhh… no thanks.”

such thing as “white culture” in America, (B) that it is somehow in

Yes. Absolutely. They were also the people tasked with things like
"packing gold into the Burmese Golden Triangle and trading it to drug
lords, then packing out opium in a US drug suppression program"
That's a near-verbatim quote from a Scholastic Book Services Weekly
Reader given me at a NY public skool in 1965 or so, complete with a pic
of pack wearing grunts in a single file column on a trail (may have been
a stock shot) and it was my very first WTF moment regarding the Vietnam
war. That US GREEN BERETS were transporting OPIUM, for WHATEVER reason!
I did not know until later that opium was going to become the French
Connection herowhine from Marseilles.
It was also news around NYU in the 60s, where the CIA was recruiting
foreign language readers as analysts to peruse piles of, lets say
Russian newspapers, to clip all things pertinent to, oh lets say
Ukraine's grain harvests, to send up the chain for further analysis,
that those hires and their managers were quitting in droves saying they
couldn't discern between the CIA's ops and the Mafia herowhine peeps.
As an aside, after I read Mike Ruppert's "Crossing The Rubicon", where
he recounted in the forward how his Ex had been observing Navy hardhat
divers near the oil platforms off the Gulf Coast Lousyanna, and later
mafia controlled work boats would come around and pick up packages
attached to the legs of the rigs, Heroin, I mentioned that to my ADL
intelligence officer dad and he piped right up and spilled the name of
the Lousyanna docks mafia boss at the time and basically validated
everything Ruppert mentioned.

Oldest white supremacist site shut down after complaint
By JAY REEVES Associated Press
August 28, 2017 12:03 PM
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - The founder of the internet's oldest white
supremacist site said he was trying to get back online Monday after a
company revoked its domain name following complaints that it promotes
hatred and is linked to dozens of murders.
Don Black, a former Ku Klux Klan leader who has operated stormfront.org
since 1995, said he didn't receive any warning before Network Solutions
blocked the use of the stormfront.org name on Friday.
Stormfront.org had more than 300,000 registered users, Black said, with
traffic increasing since a violent white nationalist rally in
Charlottesville, Virginia.
Popular with the KKK and neo-Nazi groups, the site included forums where
users sometimes promoted white power events.
"I'm talking to my lawyers, and that's about all I can do right now,"
Black, of West Palm Beach, Florida, said in a telephone interview. "I
can switch to another domain, but it might wind up the same way."
Another major white supremacist website, The Daily Stormer, was
previously shut down by the web-hosting company Go Daddy and then Google
after the violence in Charlottesville.
The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law said the
stormfront.org shutdown followed complaints it filed with Network
Solutions alleging the site promotes not only hate speech, but deadly
A spokesman for Network Solutions didn't immediately return an email
seeking comment.
Users of Black's website have been implicated in more than 100 killings,
according to the complaint, including 77 people slain by neo-Nazi Anders
Breivik at a camp in Norway in 2011.
"Especially in the wake of tragic events in Charlottesville and the
spike in hate crimes across the country, Stormfront crossed the line of
permissible speech and incited and promoted violence," said a statement
by Kristen Clarke, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for
Civil Rights Under Law.
Black, speaking about the shutdown during an online radio show Monday,
said his site had rules against promoting violence or any crime.
Black was a state KKK leader under former Klan Imperial Wizard David
Duke, who appeared on the radio show following Black and expressed his
"full support" for Black and the website.
"He was the first major site defending the rights of white people," said
Black has been involved in the white supremacy movement since the 1970s
and was convicted in 1981 for his role in a right-wing plot to overthrow
the government of Caribbean island nation of Dominica.

Fixing the "scoundrel problem" is an intractable problem I have ZERO

Ps. I take issues with Snopes interpolation of the famous AH quote about
'destroying the nucleus' where Hitler also said the Nazi rise was
assisted by the violent counter-elements.
The way to resolve that is for Non-violent Anti-fascist elements to BUTT

@_subject: =?UTF-8?Q?Future_historians_will_recall_the_war_between_4chan_and_L?= 
The Alt-Right and Antifa Are Waging a New Kind of Internet Warfare
Jacob Siegel, Vice
Aug 30 2017, 8:25am
Intelligence and surveillance powers that once belonged only to
militaries and state spooks are now available to anyone with a
high-speed internet connection.
Live long enough and you may hear future historians recall the war
between 4chan and an art collective called LaBeouf, Rönkkö & Turner.
They'll tell the story of how anonymous, interconnected imageboard users
gathered clues from public video footage, like passing aircraft and the
position of stars, to geolocate the roving, anti-Trump art project He
Will Not Divide Us, put on by actor Shia LaBeouf and his collaborators.
Records will show that the people on the group's trail—pro-Trump
activists, impish saboteurs, and budding neo-Nazis—didn't need high-end
spy gear. Instead, they found their mark by collecting and processing
public information through decentralized and supposedly leaderless
networks. It might one day look, in retrospect, like a form of social
automation: continuously updating intelligence assessments converted
into real-world effect by volunteer foot "soldiers" acting without orders.
Or maybe the saga will be remembered as a trial run of sorts, when
tactics later used in domestic guerilla warfare first appeared as
sinister pranks. Whatever happens next, the genie is out of the bottle,
and intelligence and surveillance capabilities that once belonged only
to militaries and state spooks are now available to anyone with a
high-speed internet connection.
Military theorist and futurist John Robb, who wrote the influential 2008
book Brave New War: The Next Stage of Terrorism and the End of
Globalization, developed the concept of "open-source insurgency" to
describe emerging forms of conflict. You can see a version of it at work
in the current season of political upheaval and clashes in American cities.
Of course, it's violence in the streets that captures most of the
attention, especially after a car plowed into a crowd amid the neo-Nazi
spectacle in Charlottesville, killing counter-protester Heather Heyer
and injuring many more. But in the background, much of the fighting is
being done online. Memes, trolls, bans, doxes, sock puppets, and
targeted disruption campaigns like the one used against LaBeouf, Rönkkö
& Turner are being deployed in a cycle of attacks and counterattacks
that, much like traditional military intelligence and information
operations, set conditions for the next round of physical confrontation.
The foundation of open-source insurgency is what Robb calls
"superempowerment": "an increase in the ability of individuals and small
groups to accomplish tasks/work through the combination of rapid
improvements in technological tools and access to global networks." That
increase, Robb argues, "has enabled small groups to radically increase
their productivity in conflict."
It's a concept that helps make sense of the seemingly outsized cultural
clout of the alt-right, a movement built on beliefs that fail to attract
more than fringe support in national surveys...

@_subject: House Judiciary Committee taps /r/The_Donald subreddit for Amended 
The House Judiciary Committee has a unique role to play in times of
great national crisis in the functioning of the presidency. As the
congressional body with jurisdiction over the initial stages of the
impeachment process, it’s the committee’s responsibility to weigh
whether the president’s misconduct is sufficiently severe so as to merit
what Charles Black refers to as “this most drastic of measures.”
Fortunately, Chairman Bob Goodlatte and the Republican members of his
committee are up to the task. Last week, with Russia matters heating up
and the White House in full meltdown, they stayed focused on the real
danger at hand: Huma Abedin.
The committee voted to adopt an amended resolution introduced by
Representative Matt Gaetz (R-FL) calling for a special counsel
investigation into, variously, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch’s
instructions to former FBI Director James Comey to refer to the Clinton
email probe as a “matter” rather than an “investigation”; Comey’s leaks
to Columbia University law professor Daniel Richman; Comey’s leaks to
New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt as far back as 1993 (when
Schmidt, who graduated college in 2005, would have been around ten years
old); “collusion” between Comey and Robert Mueller; any knowledge by
Comey of the Steele dossier and of efforts by the intelligence community
to surveill Trump or unmask his associates in a quest to damage Trump’s
campaign or his presidency; immunity deals provided by the FBI to
various Clinton aides over the course of the email investigation;
whether Clinton secretly approved a deal to transfer U.S. uranium
deposits to Russian control in return for donations to the Clinton
Foundation; and yes, the specific circumstances of Huma Abedin’s
employment at the State Department.
If this sounds like the work of conspiracy theorists, that’s because
that’s exactly what it is. Wired reported on Friday that a Gaetz staffer
appears to have crowdsourced the amended resolution with the help of
r/The_Donald, a pro-Trump subreddit notorious for both its embrace of
conspiracy theories and its gleeful offensiveness. The Reddit user,
“Devinm666,” regularly posted on the forum praising Gaetz, referencing
his work in Congress, and at one point publishing a picture of his
congressional ID badge with his name and face blacked out. According to
Wired, Gaetz confirmed that “Devinm666” is Devin Murphy, a legislative
aide in his office.
“I work for Congress and have been asked to come up with a list of
Clinton/Obama/election scandals for my boss ASAP,” Murphy apparently
posted on Reddit, asking for suggestions. “This is not a shitpost. This
is real. Congressional investigation. Do it for America!”
So r/The_Donald rose to the occasion and did it for America.
The text in question is not a bill, but rather a resolution of inquiry.
If passed by the House, it wouldn’t require the Attorney General to
begin a special counsel investigation running in parallel with Robert
Mueller’s investigation (and possibly branching into it in order to
investigate Mueller himself), but would merely “express the sense of the
House of Representatives that a special counsel should be appointed.”
That may be for the best, as there is already an investigation into a
number of the issues listed in the resolution by the Department of
Justice Inspector General. Additionally, most of the offenses fail to
measure up to the standards for a special counsel appointment set out in
either the Department of Justice regulations or the now-defunct
independent counsel statute, which both anticipate possible violations
of criminal law.
This procedural note on Gaetz’s call for a special counsel—its technical
status as a resolution of inquiry, rather than a bill—is key to
understanding how it came to exist in the first place. On July 14th,
Representative Pramila Jayapal (D-WA) and David Cicilline (D-RI) of the
House Judiciary Committee introduced a resolution requesting that the
Department of Justice provide Congress with various documents relevant
to the firing of James Comey. After the committee took up the
resolution, Rep. Gaetz introduced an amendment to scoop out the content
and replace it with Gaetz’s request for a special counsel, while keeping
Jayapal and Cicilline’s names on top. Gaetz’s proposal was adopted with
the full support of the committee’s majority.
Though Gaetz’s amendment and the majority’s vote were within the letter
of House procedures, Democrats on the committee are—to put it
mildly—somewhat put out by what they view as a “hijacking” of the normal
But who can blame the majority? With the Mueller investigation
continuing apace and the presidency spiraling ever further into chaos,
you wouldn’t want a responsible body of congressional oversight to get
distracted from what’s really important. Good thing the majority can
boot up Reddit.

Nazis are by definition fascists, and there's ... oh lets say 14,

corollary to those 14 in that Nazis believes White Christians are the

Fuck Graeber and everything he ever wrote. Even if he has any valid
thesis it's not an original thought and I can find similar elsewhere.
Hes a hack.
For the record, Graeber's not a historian. He's an anthropologist, a
degree which which admittedly requires a good understanding of history,
but it's not the same educational regimen, and certainly doesn't share
the same goals, as being a historian. Anthropologists are prone to
'making shit up'. Historians have a bit of a harder time doing that.
Speculation isn't encouraged.
If you look at where he's employed,  the London School of Economics. and
his tenure at Yale (the CIA's recruiting grounds), it's easy to discern
he's a literal fraud as a progressive OR anarchist
Graeber was one of the people who hijacked Occupy and totally perverted
it's intent, and he now totally perverts the meaning and intent of the
word "Anarchist" by being a fanboy of the Syrian Kurd YPG and it's
militia, who are actively and knowingly colluding with an imperial
nation, the US, for a PIECE OF EARTH, AND BORDERS!
Whose long-held dream? It would seem, as with most tribal groups
untampered by "anthropologists' like Graeber, the Kurds as a society are
happiest right where they are, in their ancestral lands, un-restrained
or hampered by other's territorial desires. Part of their problem
historically is they've been murderous assholes, so passage to just
about anywhere has historically been blocked by people hostile to them.
Then the nation-states came, and like the Roma in Europe, they're "just
in the way" of territorial expansion by those nations. But I don't feel
sorry for them. They're right in there with Bandera of Ukraine, and the
Jewish mercenaries of Irgun, both of which collaborated with the NAZIS,
for a piece of land, hedging their bet that the Germans might win WWII.
Graeber also forced the progressive faction of the Democratic Party down
everyone's throats at OWS by colluding with a cabal of media-savvy
status-seekers to modify the voting system at general assemblies,
re-interpreting the "Block" to essentially mean you voted yourself out
of the process, when the "Block" was intended to STOP the process until
some overwhelmingly wrong issue was resolved. Because democracy is
SUPPOSED TO move slowly towards a goal, to avoid mistakes that might
terminate that democracy. And it did. It meant all the prog-libs could
'pack' the general assemblies and vote in their interest, instead of
occupy's. And when it disbanded, they MARKETED IT, as if the owned some
brand. Occupy Credit Cards, Bumper Stickers for your french-fry diesel SUV.

You have a demographic?
Didn't think so.
Yeah yeah. That's what they say, usually correctly (albeit the Ukraine
Fascists in power ARE Nazis) about the word NAZI in relation to
historical events, but Fascism IS ETERNAL, The definition is right here:
All 14 traits.
14. You don't like it? start delineating more and get back to me:
spam at bitbucket.nul
The Nazi ideology is a christian identity ideology that believes, in a
very un-christian way, that anyone not of their ETHNIC BACKGROUND is
literally sub-human. Zionist share that trait when they say moronic shit
like "A Palestinian life isn't worth a Jewish fingernail".
Ukraine IS a fascist nation whose leaders have roots in their family's
historical siding with the NAZIS during WWII. You might note they're
slightly stoopid because the Nazis threw their guiding light Bandera in
prison. It would have saved his modern day believers a lot of trouble if
the Nazis had offed him, making the Nazi Fascist belief system a little
less palatable. They would simply be virulent, murderous, nationalists.
Actually, they're NEVER going to own it. Their forebearers allegedly
did, and it seems they REALLY fucked up. So this time the big mythical
banana said they could LIVE IN IT, if certain condition were met.
I do not believe they've ever met, or intend to ever meet those conditions.
But you see, they may have "Jewish blood" by birth, or conversion, but
The Zionists in Israel aren't "Jews". They're christian ethic-d and
moral-d Europeans and North American invaders (europeans) re-settled. It
has to do with Worldview. Like all indigenous people everywhere,
bloodlines are not the only thing that qualifies one.

Radiohead hides ZX Spectrum proggie in OK Computer re-release
Unclear if code was first mistaken for avant garde instrumental
By Simon Sharwood, APAC Editor
17 Jul 2017 at 07:27
Rock deities Radiohead have snuck a program for the Sinclair ZX Spectrum
into a re-release of their seminal 1997 album “OK Computer”.
Dubbed “OKNOTOK”, the re-release can be had as £100/US$130/€120 boxed
edition that includes three vinyl records, books galore and “a C90
cassette mix tape compiled by us, taken from OK COMPUTER session
archives and demo tapes.”
The Spectrum app resides – natch – on the C90 cassette, as that medium
was the dominant way of storing Speccy programs and data. Accounts of
the cassette's track list suggest it opens with a track named “Zx
sprectrum symphony” but that the application is listed as “Ok Computer
Program” and is the last track on side B.
Buyers quickly identified the track as sounding just like a Spectrum
program's distinctive series of beeps and clicks. Before long clever
folk had ripped the audio and fed it to Spectrum Emulators, producing
the results below.
See site for image:
Radiohead are far from the first band to pull off this trick: The
Stranglers added a game called “Aural Quest” to their 1984 Album Aural
Sculpture. Buzzcock-turned-Homosapien Pete Shelley's second album XL1
included a program that displayed its lyrics on-screen in synch with the
music (With limited success, if your correspondent's 35-year-old
recollections are accurate).
Those efforts appeared at a time the Spectrum was prevalent and popular.
Radiohead's release has proven an education to many, but no surprise to
fans who know well that track five on OK Computer, “Let Down”, featured
sounds produced using a Spectrum. Radiohead guitarist/keyboardist Jonny
Greenwood made those sounds as he is known to have learned to program
the machine.

Gun Control Is “Racist”? The NRA would know
By Adam Winkler
February 4, 2013
National Rifle Association President David Keene stirred controversy
Saturday by insisting that gun control’s origins were racist. “You know,
when you go back in history,” Keene told the Daily Caller, “the initial
wave of [gun laws] was instituted after the Civil War to deny blacks the
ability to defend themselves.” Keene’s history is off by at least
century—gun control existed in the American colonies and in the founding
era—but nonetheless Keene points to an ugly truth about American
history: Gun control has historically been used for racist purposes.
And the NRA’s president should know: His organization was intimately
involved in this history, promoting gun control laws that were tainted
with racism...

It's NOT specifically about speech. By definition anyone who would deny,
or ESPOUSES the denial of someone's right to exist based on some
unalterable feature of their existence like skin color of religion of
birth forfeits not only forfeits their right to 'free speech', they
forfeit the right to exist themselves, because to allow it implies you'd
allow your own self-extermination. In other words you have to
proactively act in  self-defense.
OFC then they claim to be the victims.
Meanwhile the Stormer article that got them bounced from GoDaddy said
(paraphrase) the woman who got run down (a tactic learned from 'islamic
terrorists' btw) was a fat 30-something year old woman who hadn't bred
and therefore she was worthless. What I said above about "ESPOUSES the
denial of someone's right to exist based on..." is operational here.
Also note during the Bundy Bozos Oregon standoff there were adolescents
and teen speaking to a city meeting about the refuge occupation
literally in tears claiming they were in abject fear of the Bundy crew.
In other words. Terrorism. What do we do with terrorists? ESPECIALLY
ones who terrorize CHILDREN?
Death is too good for them. I can't wait to 'victimize' a few affluent

15: The best way to beat a white nationalist is to ask him to sell his
ideology to you in a public setting. Don’t argue with him, just ask him
to describe in public what America would look like if they were in
charge, how they would make that happen, and why it’s something that
people should want.
Ask lots of questions and really press him to explain his vision; make
him describe his entire utopia. Who would have to leave? Where would
they go? Who would get to stay? How would you make that happen? Would
there be DNA tests? Has he taken a DNA test? What precisely is so great
about a white ethnostate? What would happen to food, live music and
entertainment? Once you drag their whole vision out into the light,
there are very few people who would ever find such a vision appealing
enough to try and manifest. It does not sell itself. There’s not much to
say there beyond “Uhh… no thanks.”

Yes. Absolutely. They were also the people tasked with things like
"packing gold into the Burmese Golden Triangle and trading it to drug
lords, then packing out opium in a US drug suppression program"
That's a near-verbatim quote from a Scholastic Book Services Weekly
Reader given me at a NY public skool in 1965 or so, complete with a pic
of pack wearing grunts in a single file column on a trail (may have been
a stock shot) and it was my very first WTF moment regarding the Vietnam
war. That US GREEN BERETS were transporting OPIUM, for WHATEVER reason!
I did not know until later that opium was going to become the French
Connection herowhine from Marseilles.
It was also news around NYU in the 60s, where the CIA was recruiting
foreign language readers as analysts to peruse piles of, lets say
Russian newspapers, to clip all things pertinent to, oh lets say
Ukraine's grain harvests, to send up the chain for further analysis,
that those hires and their managers were quitting in droves saying they
couldn't discern between the CIA's ops and the Mafia herowhine peeps.
As an aside, after I read Mike Ruppert's "Crossing The Rubicon", where
he recounted in the forward how his Ex had been observing Navy hardhat
divers near the oil platforms off the Gulf Coast Lousyanna, and later
mafia controlled work boats would come around and pick up packages
attached to the legs of the rigs, Heroin, I mentioned that to my ADL
intelligence officer dad and he piped right up and spilled the name of
the Lousyanna docks mafia boss at the time and basically validated
everything Ruppert mentioned.
Dan Sheehan was a local here for some time. We've crossed paths.

Oldest white supremacist site shut down after complaint
By JAY REEVES Associated Press
August 28, 2017 12:03 PM
BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - The founder of the internet's oldest white
supremacist site said he was trying to get back online Monday after a
company revoked its domain name following complaints that it promotes
hatred and is linked to dozens of murders.
Don Black, a former Ku Klux Klan leader who has operated stormfront.org
since 1995, said he didn't receive any warning before Network Solutions
blocked the use of the stormfront.org name on Friday.
Stormfront.org had more than 300,000 registered users, Black said, with
traffic increasing since a violent white nationalist rally in
Charlottesville, Virginia.
Popular with the KKK and neo-Nazi groups, the site included forums where
users sometimes promoted white power events.
"I'm talking to my lawyers, and that's about all I can do right now,"
Black, of West Palm Beach, Florida, said in a telephone interview. "I
can switch to another domain, but it might wind up the same way."
Another major white supremacist website, The Daily Stormer, was
previously shut down by the web-hosting company Go Daddy and then Google
after the violence in Charlottesville.
The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law said the
stormfront.org shutdown followed complaints it filed with Network
Solutions alleging the site promotes not only hate speech, but deadly
A spokesman for Network Solutions didn't immediately return an email
seeking comment.
Users of Black's website have been implicated in more than 100 killings,
according to the complaint, including 77 people slain by neo-Nazi Anders
Breivik at a camp in Norway in 2011.
"Especially in the wake of tragic events in Charlottesville and the
spike in hate crimes across the country, Stormfront crossed the line of
permissible speech and incited and promoted violence," said a statement
by Kristen Clarke, executive director of the Lawyers' Committee for
Civil Rights Under Law.
Black, speaking about the shutdown during an online radio show Monday,
said his site had rules against promoting violence or any crime.
Black was a state KKK leader under former Klan Imperial Wizard David
Duke, who appeared on the radio show following Black and expressed his
"full support" for Black and the website.
"He was the first major site defending the rights of white people," said
Black has been involved in the white supremacy movement since the 1970s
and was convicted in 1981 for his role in a right-wing plot to overthrow
the government of Caribbean island nation of Dominica.

Fixing the "scoundrel problem" is an intractable problem I have ZERO
time for. Allowing an ideology to be promulgated negating human
existence due to some unalterable trait is simply suicide for a society,
and as can be seen from history, any society nearby.
Ps. I take issues with Snopes interpolation of the famous AH quote about
'destroying the nucleus' where Hitler also said the Nazi rise was
assisted by the violent counter-elements.
The way to resolve that is for Non-violent Anti-fascist elements to BUTT
THE FUCK OUT and practice TACTIC-TOLERANCE. If the media wants to talk
to them about it, JUST TELL THE MEDIA YOU ARE THERE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT
YOU ARE DOING, and desist from ANY discussion of other organizations OR

There is a large Non-violent Anti-fascist element in the US that did NOT

@_subject: =?UTF-8?Q?Future_historians_will_recall_the_war_between_4chan_and_L?= 
The Alt-Right and Antifa Are Waging a New Kind of Internet Warfare
Jacob Siegel, Vice
Aug 30 2017, 8:25am
Intelligence and surveillance powers that once belonged only to
militaries and state spooks are now available to anyone with a
high-speed internet connection.
Live long enough and you may hear future historians recall the war
between 4chan and an art collective called LaBeouf, Rönkkö & Turner.
They'll tell the story of how anonymous, interconnected imageboard users
gathered clues from public video footage, like passing aircraft and the
position of stars, to geolocate the roving, anti-Trump art project He
Will Not Divide Us, put on by actor Shia LaBeouf and his collaborators.
Records will show that the people on the group's trail—pro-Trump
activists, impish saboteurs, and budding neo-Nazis—didn't need high-end
spy gear. Instead, they found their mark by collecting and processing
public information through decentralized and supposedly leaderless
networks. It might one day look, in retrospect, like a form of social
automation: continuously updating intelligence assessments converted
into real-world effect by volunteer foot "soldiers" acting without orders.
Or maybe the saga will be remembered as a trial run of sorts, when
tactics later used in domestic guerilla warfare first appeared as
sinister pranks. Whatever happens next, the genie is out of the bottle,
and intelligence and surveillance capabilities that once belonged only
to militaries and state spooks are now available to anyone with a
high-speed internet connection.
Military theorist and futurist John Robb, who wrote the influential 2008
book Brave New War: The Next Stage of Terrorism and the End of
Globalization, developed the concept of "open-source insurgency" to
describe emerging forms of conflict. You can see a version of it at work
in the current season of political upheaval and clashes in American cities.
Of course, it's violence in the streets that captures most of the
attention, especially after a car plowed into a crowd amid the neo-Nazi
spectacle in Charlottesville, killing counter-protester Heather Heyer
and injuring many more. But in the background, much of the fighting is
being done online. Memes, trolls, bans, doxes, sock puppets, and
targeted disruption campaigns like the one used against LaBeouf, Rönkkö
& Turner are being deployed in a cycle of attacks and counterattacks
that, much like traditional military intelligence and information
operations, set conditions for the next round of physical confrontation.
The foundation of open-source insurgency is what Robb calls
"superempowerment": "an increase in the ability of individuals and small
groups to accomplish tasks/work through the combination of rapid
improvements in technological tools and access to global networks." That
increase, Robb argues, "has enabled small groups to radically increase
their productivity in conflict."
It's a concept that helps make sense of the seemingly outsized cultural
clout of the alt-right, a movement built on beliefs that fail to attract
more than fringe support in national surveys...

From that ars technical link
However, we can make some educated guesses. For starters, we know the industry's revenue: Bitcoin miners currently generate 75 bitcoins per hour, which, at the current price of around $12,500 per bitcoin, translates to $937,500 per hour, or more than $8 billion per year.
Moreover, the industry is highly competitive, and electricity is one of its biggest costs. So when the price of bitcoins rises, we can expect miners to spend more and more on electricity until electricity costs are roughly on par with revenues.
This is the methodology the Digiconomist (link... use it scumbag.) website uses to estimate the Bitcoin network's energy consumption. It assumes that the industry will spend 60 percent of its revenue on electricity and then extrapolates from the current bitcoin price and prevailing electricity prices. It finds that the network is consuming energy at an annual rate of 32TWh.
It also assumes that the network takes time to adjust to big price increases like we've seen in recent days. This means that, if Bitcoin stays above $12,000, we can expect this figure to rise further in the coming weeks."

There is a question I would like to send to the list and get some feedback.
As far as I was told, consensus is a way to reach a decision without the
need of voting, so there is no majority nor minority, no one can impose
their ways even if they are majority so no lobby and no forcing.
Clearly, education is needed for that, so everyone understands the need
of giving up a little bit in order to make it work for the common project.
Lately I've been seeing consensus described as voting system, with
majorities and minorities. My english is short, so maybe there is a word
to describe consensus as a no-voting system to reach a common solution?

Bitcoin is produced in relation to other economic goods, and under the

those costs go up, production of bitcoin goes does, and if other

December 18, 2017

bitcoin Is Makeworky Unmoney
bitcoin is not exactly money. It’s a potentially valuable abstraction of computational ‘work’ that ‘earns’ bitcoin value. But what is bitcoin value and what is the nature of the work? The answers are bizarre because they are nonsensical.
bitcoin value is an abstraction of participation in the history of the network and its transactions. ‘Work’ is a (largely) nonuseful recomputation of, first, the transaction history of the network — which has to be reprocessed each time there is a bitcoin transaction. Then, continual banging away at some useless math with added ‘weight factor’ that makes it arbitrarily difficult for computers to accomplish the generation of a new record-set over time.
The bitcoin algorithms adjust this factor in order to require enough ersatz work so that the heartbeat of the system pulses (produces a block) approximately every ten minutes… and they scale the computational complexity accordingly via input from bitcoin’s own daily developmental activity.
By crossing an invented computational abyss, millions of computers and other machines, many of which have been secretly compromised by hacks, are working full tilt, around the clock… to simply generate a deeper abyss requiring ever-more powerful and numerous computers to cross. And this generates ‘blocks’ in an economy of numbers in machines. These numbers are not exactly money, and their actual value is more complex than cash. And the machines must be serviced, cooled, attended and backed-up, as must the results of their nearly useless hyperactivity.
Most participants are using machines specially designed to resolve these invented computational targets, and as we make faster computers to do this, the network amplifies the difficulty to throttle the pulse.
What is all this about? Well, it’s not a simple question.
Let’s start with money.
What Is Money?
To understand money, one must begin to understand its sources. Perhaps the most fundamental of such introductions is the direct and fascinated observation of animals in nature. The origins of money (and memory) are in nature; exploring them has profound implications for own developing creativity and intelligence.
Beavers, squirrels and other small creatures, including the incredibly inventive corvids, store food (and sometimes treasures) in hiding places we call caches. Some predators may also cache food briefly (meat tends to go bad or get eaten by other creatures who can sense its presence). So, too, ants, wasps, bees and other social insects. This is actually a mode of living memory.
Notice the homonomy here? Cache and cash are the same sound, and this isn’t accidental. Direct relation with nature as and through living places is the original source of our concepts of value. Our relationships with environmentally accessible resources and caching are not merely the beginning of our monetary systems, they are the probable origin point of the peculiar forms of memory and cognition that are the hallmark of our species.
We carefully cache and value our dead. And money is an abstraction of dead people, places, and moments.
Our kind of mind was born in forests and places fraught with elaborate relational constellations of biodiversity and symbiotic intelligence. Alas, the nominal treasure we acquired there went haywire, and now we have nearly wiped those places off the map and erased them from our experience. What was their replacement?
Money (and machines). A representation of cached value, extensible to nearly any common domain of exchange.
There are no living places anymore. We do not encounter or create value… we get cash. Most of the time… that means that someone, or some ecology somewhere, is being wiped out. The results are representational forms of wealth and power.
We don’t have ancient forests any more, and the futures they portended are gone. What there are, are sheets of paper, ingots of gold, diamonds, and little banks of numbers… in machines. On balance sheets.
Numeric Supremacy
Numbers. We keep track of them. Too often they become lethal fictions with which ‘we’ (ostensibly: our societies and their systems) determine who lives and who dies. Who is wealthy and who bereft. Everyone is identified by and for the sake of numbers. We imagine these numbers to be true, just, inviolable. But we do not really understand the valuations or applications we celebrate and avow as real; there are always many aspects of value with crucial bearing on any analysis that we leave out of our accounting. Living beings, for example. Minds.
Many of our bizarre celebrations of monetary value or obedience to statistical analyses are simply flawed. It’s hard to get reasonable statistics for any real-world situation. Sometimes we are using stats that are cripplingly outdated or merely wrong. Assays attempting to discover the (astronomical) number of birds killed by electricity transmission only counted those found near wires. What’s the actual number, or a very close guess? We don’t know, because statistics are not entirely reliable beyond their well-behaved purposive contexts. Statistics, it turns out, are very often both manipulable and conveniently monodimensional.
So, too, the cash that stands sovereign behind them.
Such ‘numbers’ and our mishandling of them partly determine or suggest to us what to believe or think about ourselves, each other… the nature of the real. They portend what resources are protected, abstracted from nature, transported or obliterated, for what purposes, and whose ‘profit’.
We seem to have a serious vulnerability as regards representations. Our peculiar fantasies about the meaning of progress or success have cast life on Earth into direct competition with their outcomes—living beings and places now compete for terrain, safety and survival directly against not only objects, habits and machines… but mere data. And they lose.
So do we.
A photograph can become so popular that hundreds or even thousands of creatures must die simply to sustain and transmit it millions or billions of times. As unthinkable as this is, it is a fact: people die because numbers in machines merit more resources, attention, care, and nurturance than living beings.
Our electronic activity and transactions have absolutely lethal real world costs that no one is paying attention to. And as we continue to invest human attention and work in an increasingly unreal electronic representation of reality, those prices become staggering. They were unsurvivable 20 years ago. Today, they are simply an ever-expanding array of new forms of environmental, social and psychological rape. For profit. And they can hide in our cultures and lives in ways that are as deadly as they are invisible.
When Costs Go Explosive — And Invisible
One of the statistics that is modestly important here is the present population of our species and its growth over say, the last 100 years or so. These figures project their significance on everything we do, and dramatically magnify the repercussions of our common choices simply by increasing the power and frequency of the activities that produce them. An automobile trip to the grocery store has an environmental impact that rises precipitously as populations repeating it double or quadruple.
And this is what has been happening with our population for quite a while now. Perhaps it is nearly as significant that the number of objects per person… particularly machines… has skyrocketed in developed nations. In other words: there are at least two population problems. Ours, and that represented by our machines. Most are happy to complain about the humans. Nearly no one is complaining about the machines.
I find this suspicious.
Here are some ‘interesting numbers’: the statistics of human population growth. It took us at least 2 million years to reach our first billion. It took us approximately 123 to reach the next.
A mere 33 took us to our third.
The population gradient for ambient human bodies on Earth.
Prior to around 1800, the most serious human threats to the living planet were deforestation for the sake of construction, war or fuel and maybe wildfires. Secondary to those was mass hunting—particularly the vast atrocities that wiped out entire populations of animals for sport, base ignorance, commerce, or purposes related to human habitation of terrain.
But between the 2nd and 3rd tiers of the human population explosion, new and profusely invasive competitors for resources, attention and terrain were multiplying madly—at rates no one really bothered to examine. During this period, two specific human activity-threats skyrocketed into cultural and ecological dominance, and their impact continues to inscribe a deadly and indelible mark on both human history and terrestrial ecology. I speak here of the machine and the product-for-profit.
Machines are objects against which human beings and living places must directly compete—and we are losing this competition. Inert objects merit more care, attention, valuation, developmental interest, terrain rights, fuel and ‘freedom to reproduce’ than their human originators or the ecologies that are the sources of life and planetary homeostasis. Every living being and place has been subjected to their intrusion, emissions and domination—especially in war. Further, the invention and development of mechanical technology has had profound and unexpected impacts on human development.
Over the past 150 years, Homo Sapiens Sapiens has effectively redirected or even replaced our evolutionary developmental progress in a number of unexpected ways by inhibition, substitution, self-poisoning and, most significantly, by wiping out the ecologies which were the original sources of our evolutionary ascent; standing nearby as both agency of accomplishment and cause we find ‘the machine’.
I would argue that our broad-scale fascination with machines has derailed the development of the intellectual and relational assets necessary to direct our own cultures, let alone the technologies in question, with any degree of insight or wisdom. We have become materialists, and in so doing, we have sounded the death knell of the nurseries of life and intelligence on Earth.
Our extended cultures and collectives are not properly equipped to direct the forces that value, pursue and accomplish technological and industrial development. Our ordinary activities produce results so incredibly ill-considered that were we to pause even briefly in contemplation of them we would prohibit them absolutely. We do not thus pause. Money and the need for it fuel the conversion of the living planet to representations such as cash or goods. And so, too, our human potentials and minds.
It’s murder for money.
Numbers in machines that represent value.
Representations like money arise when what is being represented is no longer available to common experience or expression. As the forests of oral memory were wiped out, we acquired writing. As the experience of the profound value of living beings and places disappeared from common experience, we got a new kind of greenery: cash.
And as cash begins to disappear, we will achieve the ‘third wave’ of re-representation: digital money. Stuff that is not even an object. Nothing more than numbers in machines.
In the case of bitcoin, we are talking about machines that compete against living places and human lives for energy, space, resources, and … attention.
Hashing For Cash: Machines Get busy
So, let’s get down to business. What is bitcoin, really? You can think of it as a machine contagion—a network of devices amped to their performance tolerances—machines that do nothing but reprocess every transaction that ever occurred on their network (thus achieving ‘consensus’) while, at the same time, ‘mining’ new blocks of coins (currently worth about 25 btc) by solving a purposefully cumbersome mathematical formula which doesn’t actually accomplish anything other than enforcing computational difficulty. That is: making millions of machines grind away madly at nothing.
This mining process is both the reprocessing of transactions (to join the network), and a ‘weight’ factor that is incremented to insure that the average time for the entire network to ‘solve’ a block (that is, to produce an accurate guess close enough to a mathematically supplied target) is ‘about 10 minutes’.
When you initiate a new machine into the network, you download the current transaction record (a 6-gigabyte file) of the entire history of bitcoin and reprocess it (this takes around 24 hours). You then either ‘mine’ alone (an almost useless endeavor which would take ~98 years to solve a block) or you join a pool of machines. By joining a pool, you get statistically better performance in terms of satoshi (currently: USD $0.0000046543 each) earned as you are ‘rewarded’ for work done by your machine’s participation in the pool.
The more processing power (raw computational force over time) you can bring to bear on ‘the problem’ … the better a chance you have to earn incremental additions to your ‘wallet’ or account. Of course, most of the problem is invented… to be this kind of problem—one that requires more and more computational activity to qualify as complete. And we have now invented specialized machines and chips just to solve this problem.
Machines involved in mining are pressed to the limits of their power consumption and performance profiles; they are ‘pinned’ at 100%+ of their computing power, ceaselessly, and thus generate heat (as well as consuming copious quantities of electrical power).
Because they remain hot, they have to be electronically ventilated. This process of power-heating something we must in turn power-cool, for the phony ‘sake’ of mathematical processes intended to make more work each time they are implemented is deranged. We’re essentially turning computers into heaters that we have to cool to recompute previous computations with. On purpose. A single day of the environmental costs of this process are so catastrophic that if we ever did the accounting — if anyone did — we would immediately understand that this entire idea is a mode of ‘fracking the whole environment’ whose costs rise explosively with every moment we continue the process.
These traditionalists worry that a larger block size will raise the minimum amount of computing power required to fully participate in the Bitcoin network’s peer-to-peer process for clearing transactions. To fully participate in this process, a computer needs to receive a copy of every transaction that has ever been made on the network, which can add up to gigabytes of data every month. If the block limit is raised, then running a Bitcoin node will become even more resource-intensive, potentially pricing out smaller players.
Only a species that had gone entirely insane, and consciously intended to wipe out life on Earth would ever consider such a process. But any species that could actively celebrate and expand it — must be understood as both emphatically suicidal and openly omnicidal. 
In short: they intend to kill everything, anything, and themselves — and are hell-bent on the continuous and unlimited expansion of this agenda.
The activity of the bitcoin process and some similar networks are not only burning down the future; they are also obliterating the history of humanity and life on Earth, faster and more aggressively every moment, by destroying the living results and opportunities established by this history, and insuring that the benefits that might otherwise blossom into astonishing ‘interest on investment’, are killed off by the necessity of breeding, operating, heating and cooling millions of machines that do makework for a resource that only exists as numbers in machines.
No one with anything resembling a mind would ever allow, let alone celebrate this, and the fact that our modern cultures are doing both is a symptom more serious than our obsessions with war, ecological atrocity, rape-for-profit, and the generation of other lethal processes such as the automobile, the atomic bomb, nuclear reactors and prisons.
bitcoin is an invisible, self-expanding prison/war that, like fracking ‘hides the damage’ in every place and life on Earth. It is a way of violently undermining the very bases of life on Earth, and the fact that no one is doing the accounting is a sign that the social and environmental intelligences of our species have become actively self-compromising.
Imagine if your immune system started producing new forms of HIV instead of macrophages and antibodies… and you begin to get the picture.
Thankfully, there is a limit to the process, but it’s taking a while to get there. The limit is 21 million bitcoins, at least in the present implementation. What does this mean? Well, it means that, according to some sources, 80% of mineable bitcoins will have been acquired within about a year. It also means that the miner margin will shrink, making the process less attractive. It’s not clear what will take place, or if the tail end of this process can be completely accomplished. It’s also not impossible that the present implementation will begin to transform, or reiterate itself once all bitcoins have been mined.
bitcoin forks into two processes 08.01.17.
Money is cached torture, murder, atrocity, and domination. It represents possible transactions in future time by obliterating living beings and opportunities in present time.
The only ‘value’ of the computation thus accomplished is that it leverages statistical complexity against computational power in order to mathematically throttle block (and thus bitcoin) production. So, we are inventing increasing quantities of work for increasing quantities of computers to do and the easier it becomes, the more we throttle it to make it harder… faster.
Purportedly, all of this bother results in profit, at least in theory. I say in theory because the putative returns require investments… of time, space, electricity, temperature, attention… and… computation. What one invests in one way is lost twice, both in the investment and in what more profitable or noble work might have been done with the same effort or resources.
There are a wide variety of other problems here, from the fact that malware that infects vast numbers of machines has been found mining bitcoin (resource diversion), to the embarrassing ‘sudden disappearance’ of thousands (or occasionally millions) of dollars worth of bitcoins in thefts from ‘exchanges’ or technical bungles (wallet loss).
Why are we purchasing banks of highly specialized computers and heating them up with computational burdens that tax their performance spec and then paying to cool them back down—in order to accomplish nothing useful?
The answer is that we have invented a ‘false problem’ that tens of thousands of machines now work to achieve the result for relatively uninterrupted, and these machines are themselves resources which require resources to build, run, track, back up, and otherwise maintain. How much varies widely by installation, but as you can see in the image that begins this essay, many people are building banks of machines that do nothing but process bitcoin blocks. Nothing else. Just that. And these have to be housed, stored, powered, repaired, attended, backed-up, protected, and cooled.
Bitcoin Energy Usage Analysis.
bitcoin is an essentially mechano-vampiric paradigm where massive amounts of actually usless computation are done with increasing ferocity while producing nothing of any value whatsoever except a kind of pure abstraction of computing having been done, and the glorious ‘record of transactions’ which becomes a veritable church of common computational record—and remains just as meaningless in that guise.
Those who are involved in this racket have chosen to dedicate cash, space, power and other resources to the process. But what is the process? It is to process a meaningless series of processes, ever-more ineffectively, on purpose.
That’s the wrong thing to dedicate resources to, and it produces direct mechanical competition against our own minds, cultures, needs and development. The idea of a homegrown electronic cryptocurrency is not entirely misguided. Personally, I think it would be powerful to develop something that produces value based on merit of actual work, discovery or contribution… accomplished by individuals or collectives. This is something I hope we may see relatively soon. But what bitcoin is and is doing is stridently malformed.
What exactly is profit? A crucial part of the answer is that it is the abstracted remains of obliterated lives, pricelessly irreplaceable ecosystems and precious relationships we never noticed or acknowledged, let alone understood. It is the remains of what might have been revolutionary intelligence, discovery, mutual uplift, evolution, wonder and actual human progress. It is the bodies and remains of animals, human beings and families, dreams of access to new developmental and creative opportunities, and living worlds of possibility that were burnt down and turned into little sheets of paper.
In all too many cases, the ‘next big thing’ is actually the next endlessly self-amplifying graveyard.
It is well-known that a ‘materially successful’ male or female represents an attractive mating partner for a variety of reasons, both profound and superficial in nature. In effect, the ‘standing cache’ of a given person or group is a signal about how effective various aspects of their skills and/or intelligence are in the specific domains that these representations are derived from.
The problem is this: the message is mixed, because their cache is social power… but its sources and functions often begin with atrocities,, some of which reach far back into the history of our people and the land.
“The Kwakiutl called their money objects yaklelwas, which means “bad things,” a word that has the same root as ‘dead bodies” and “intestines.” When they had their potlatch money-destruction ceremonies they said they were “wiping off the shame” from their body, like one wipes off shit, by giving money away or destroying it.(11)”

Note : There are now a large number of cryptocurrencies, each with unique features, benefits and costs of operation. While some of these may utilize similar processes that require vast amounts of computational activity to generate, others do not. I am presently doing some research to understand more about the other systems, some of which are mentioned in the comments.

From that ars technical link
However, we can make some educated guesses. For starters, we know the industry's revenue: Bitcoin miners currently generate 75 bitcoins per hour, which, at the current price of around $12,500 per bitcoin, translates to $937,500 per hour, or more than $8 billion per year.
Moreover, the industry is highly competitive, and electricity is one of its biggest costs. So when the price of bitcoins rises, we can expect miners to spend more and more on electricity until electricity costs are roughly on par with revenues.
This is the methodology the Digiconomist (link... use it scumbag.) website uses to estimate the Bitcoin network's energy consumption. It assumes that the industry will spend 60 percent of its revenue on electricity and then extrapolates from the current bitcoin price and prevailing electricity prices. It finds that the network is consuming energy at an annual rate of 32TWh.
It also assumes that the network takes time to adjust to big price increases like we've seen in recent days. This means that, if Bitcoin stays above $12,000, we can expect this figure to rise further in the coming weeks."

As far as I was told, consensus is a way to reach a decision without the
need of voting, so there is no majority nor minority, no one can impose
their ways even if they are majority so no lobby and no forcing.
Clearly, education is needed for that, so everyone understands the need
of giving up a little bit in order to make it work for the common project.
Lately I've been seeing consensus described as voting system, with
majorities and minorities. My english is short, so maybe there is a word
to describe consensus as a no-voting system to reach a common solution?

You gloss over the fact that if coal and oil didn't pollute, and we
had infinite free energy, bitcoin would be (relatively)
[use|worth]less, and we'd not have to worry about most any shortage at
Michael drew the correct conclusion.
Bitcoin is produced in relation to other economic goods, and under the
constraints of the costs of energy and computer infrastructure. If
those costs go up, production of bitcoin goes does, and if other
economic goods become more valuable relative to bitcoin, then again
production of bitcoin goes down.

You're forgetting how to add. As in added electrical demand and concurrent pollution in the here and now. Furthermore, we learn in Sociology 1 that as dirty as primitive societies are about their energy use, they use the energy MUCH more efficiently, and I suggest that applies to any "improvement" in currency as well. Scaled, btc will be less efficient in its use of energy leading to "dead planet". To clarify that... dead as far as human survival.

 Bitcoin = Death Processors
December 18, 2017
 by Darin Stevenson / Medium
bitcoin Is Makeworky Unmoney
bitcoin is not exactly money. It’s a potentially valuable abstraction of computational ‘work’ that ‘earns’ bitcoin value. But what is bitcoin value and what is the nature of the work? The answers are bizarre because they are nonsensical.
bitcoin value is an abstraction of participation in the history of the network and its transactions. ‘Work’ is a (largely) nonuseful recomputation of, first, the transaction history of the network — which has to be reprocessed each time there is a bitcoin transaction. Then, continual banging away at some useless math with added ‘weight factor’ that makes it arbitrarily difficult for computers to accomplish the generation of a new record-set over time.
The bitcoin algorithms adjust this factor in order to require enough ersatz work so that the heartbeat of the system pulses (produces a block) approximately every ten minutes… and they scale the computational complexity accordingly via input from bitcoin’s own daily developmental activity.
By crossing an invented computational abyss, millions of computers and other machines, many of which have been secretly compromised by hacks, are working full tilt, around the clock… to simply generate a deeper abyss requiring ever-more powerful and numerous computers to cross. And this generates ‘blocks’ in an economy of numbers in machines. These numbers are not exactly money, and their actual value is more complex than cash. And the machines must be serviced, cooled, attended and backed-up, as must the results of their nearly useless hyperactivity.
Most participants are using machines specially designed to resolve these invented computational targets, and as we make faster computers to do this, the network amplifies the difficulty to throttle the pulse.
What is all this about? Well, it’s not a simple question.
Let’s start with money.
What Is Money?
To understand money, one must begin to understand its sources. Perhaps the most fundamental of such introductions is the direct and fascinated observation of animals in nature. The origins of money (and memory) are in nature; exploring them has profound implications for own developing creativity and intelligence.
Beavers, squirrels and other small creatures, including the incredibly inventive corvids, store food (and sometimes treasures) in hiding places we call caches. Some predators may also cache food briefly (meat tends to go bad or get eaten by other creatures who can sense its presence). So, too, ants, wasps, bees and other social insects. This is actually a mode of living memory.
Notice the homonomy here? Cache and cash are the same sound, and this isn’t accidental. Direct relation with nature as and through living places is the original source of our concepts of value. Our relationships with environmentally accessible resources and caching are not merely the beginning of our monetary systems, they are the probable origin point of the peculiar forms of memory and cognition that are the hallmark of our species.
We carefully cache and value our dead. And money is an abstraction of dead people, places, and moments.
Our kind of mind was born in forests and places fraught with elaborate relational constellations of biodiversity and symbiotic intelligence. Alas, the nominal treasure we acquired there went haywire, and now we have nearly wiped those places off the map and erased them from our experience. What was their replacement?
Money (and machines). A representation of cached value, extensible to nearly any common domain of exchange.
There are no living places anymore. We do not encounter or create value… we get cash. Most of the time… that means that someone, or some ecology somewhere, is being wiped out. The results are representational forms of wealth and power.
We don’t have ancient forests any more, and the futures they portended are gone. What there are, are sheets of paper, ingots of gold, diamonds, and little banks of numbers… in machines. On balance sheets.
Numeric Supremacy
Numbers. We keep track of them. Too often they become lethal fictions with which ‘we’ (ostensibly: our societies and their systems) determine who lives and who dies. Who is wealthy and who bereft. Everyone is identified by and for the sake of numbers. We imagine these numbers to be true, just, inviolable. But we do not really understand the valuations or applications we celebrate and avow as real; there are always many aspects of value with crucial bearing on any analysis that we leave out of our accounting. Living beings, for example. Minds.
Many of our bizarre celebrations of monetary value or obedience to statistical analyses are simply flawed. It’s hard to get reasonable statistics for any real-world situation. Sometimes we are using stats that are cripplingly outdated or merely wrong. Assays attempting to discover the (astronomical) number of birds killed by electricity transmission only counted those found near wires. What’s the actual number, or a very close guess? We don’t know, because statistics are not entirely reliable beyond their well-behaved purposive contexts. Statistics, it turns out, are very often both manipulable and conveniently monodimensional.
So, too, the cash that stands sovereign behind them.
Such ‘numbers’ and our mishandling of them partly determine or suggest to us what to believe or think about ourselves, each other… the nature of the real. They portend what resources are protected, abstracted from nature, transported or obliterated, for what purposes, and whose ‘profit’.
We seem to have a serious vulnerability as regards representations. Our peculiar fantasies about the meaning of progress or success have cast life on Earth into direct competition with their outcomes—living beings and places now compete for terrain, safety and survival directly against not only objects, habits and machines… but mere data. And they lose.
So do we.
A photograph can become so popular that hundreds or even thousands of creatures must die simply to sustain and transmit it millions or billions of times. As unthinkable as this is, it is a fact: people die because numbers in machines merit more resources, attention, care, and nurturance than living beings.
Our electronic activity and transactions have absolutely lethal real world costs that no one is paying attention to. And as we continue to invest human attention and work in an increasingly unreal electronic representation of reality, those prices become staggering. They were unsurvivable 20 years ago. Today, they are simply an ever-expanding array of new forms of environmental, social and psychological rape. For profit. And they can hide in our cultures and lives in ways that are as deadly as they are invisible.
When Costs Go Explosive — And Invisible
One of the statistics that is modestly important here is the present population of our species and its growth over say, the last 100 years or so. These figures project their significance on everything we do, and dramatically magnify the repercussions of our common choices simply by increasing the power and frequency of the activities that produce them. An automobile trip to the grocery store has an environmental impact that rises precipitously as populations repeating it double or quadruple.
And this is what has been happening with our population for quite a while now. Perhaps it is nearly as significant that the number of objects per person… particularly machines… has skyrocketed in developed nations. In other words: there are at least two population problems. Ours, and that represented by our machines. Most are happy to complain about the humans. Nearly no one is complaining about the machines.
I find this suspicious.
Here are some ‘interesting numbers’: the statistics of human population growth. It took us at least 2 million years to reach our first billion. It took us approximately 123 to reach the next.
A mere 33 took us to our third.
The population gradient for ambient human bodies on Earth.
Prior to around 1800, the most serious human threats to the living planet were deforestation for the sake of construction, war or fuel and maybe wildfires. Secondary to those was mass hunting—particularly the vast atrocities that wiped out entire populations of animals for sport, base ignorance, commerce, or purposes related to human habitation of terrain.
But between the 2nd and 3rd tiers of the human population explosion, new and profusely invasive competitors for resources, attention and terrain were multiplying madly—at rates no one really bothered to examine. During this period, two specific human activity-threats skyrocketed into cultural and ecological dominance, and their impact continues to inscribe a deadly and indelible mark on both human history and terrestrial ecology. I speak here of the machine and the product-for-profit.
Machines are objects against which human beings and living places must directly compete—and we are losing this competition. Inert objects merit more care, attention, valuation, developmental interest, terrain rights, fuel and ‘freedom to reproduce’ than their human originators or the ecologies that are the sources of life and planetary homeostasis. Every living being and place has been subjected to their intrusion, emissions and domination—especially in war. Further, the invention and development of mechanical technology has had profound and unexpected impacts on human development.
Over the past 150 years, Homo Sapiens Sapiens has effectively redirected or even replaced our evolutionary developmental progress in a number of unexpected ways by inhibition, substitution, self-poisoning and, most significantly, by wiping out the ecologies which were the original sources of our evolutionary ascent; standing nearby as both agency of accomplishment and cause we find ‘the machine’.
I would argue that our broad-scale fascination with machines has derailed the development of the intellectual and relational assets necessary to direct our own cultures, let alone the technologies in question, with any degree of insight or wisdom. We have become materialists, and in so doing, we have sounded the death knell of the nurseries of life and intelligence on Earth.
Our extended cultures and collectives are not properly equipped to direct the forces that value, pursue and accomplish technological and industrial development. Our ordinary activities produce results so incredibly ill-considered that were we to pause even briefly in contemplation of them we would prohibit them absolutely. We do not thus pause. Money and the need for it fuel the conversion of the living planet to representations such as cash or goods. And so, too, our human potentials and minds.
It’s murder for money.
Numbers in machines that represent value.
Representations like money arise when what is being represented is no longer available to common experience or expression. As the forests of oral memory were wiped out, we acquired writing. As the experience of the profound value of living beings and places disappeared from common experience, we got a new kind of greenery: cash.
And as cash begins to disappear, we will achieve the ‘third wave’ of re-representation: digital money. Stuff that is not even an object. Nothing more than numbers in machines.
In the case of bitcoin, we are talking about machines that compete against living places and human lives for energy, space, resources, and … attention.
Hashing For Cash: Machines Get busy
So, let’s get down to business. What is bitcoin, really? You can think of it as a machine contagion—a network of devices amped to their performance tolerances—machines that do nothing but reprocess every transaction that ever occurred on their network (thus achieving ‘consensus’) while, at the same time, ‘mining’ new blocks of coins (currently worth about 25 btc) by solving a purposefully cumbersome mathematical formula which doesn’t actually accomplish anything other than enforcing computational difficulty. That is: making millions of machines grind away madly at nothing.
This mining process is both the reprocessing of transactions (to join the network), and a ‘weight’ factor that is incremented to insure that the average time for the entire network to ‘solve’ a block (that is, to produce an accurate guess close enough to a mathematically supplied target) is ‘about 10 minutes’.
When you initiate a new machine into the network, you download the current transaction record (a 6-gigabyte file) of the entire history of bitcoin and reprocess it (this takes around 24 hours). You then either ‘mine’ alone (an almost useless endeavor which would take ~98 years to solve a block) or you join a pool of machines. By joining a pool, you get statistically better performance in terms of satoshi (currently: USD $0.0000046543 each) earned as you are ‘rewarded’ for work done by your machine’s participation in the pool.
The more processing power (raw computational force over time) you can bring to bear on ‘the problem’ … the better a chance you have to earn incremental additions to your ‘wallet’ or account. Of course, most of the problem is invented… to be this kind of problem—one that requires more and more computational activity to qualify as complete. And we have now invented specialized machines and chips just to solve this problem.
Machines involved in mining are pressed to the limits of their power consumption and performance profiles; they are ‘pinned’ at 100%+ of their computing power, ceaselessly, and thus generate heat (as well as consuming copious quantities of electrical power).
Because they remain hot, they have to be electronically ventilated. This process of power-heating something we must in turn power-cool, for the phony ‘sake’ of mathematical processes intended to make more work each time they are implemented is deranged. We’re essentially turning computers into heaters that we have to cool to recompute previous computations with. On purpose. A single day of the environmental costs of this process are so catastrophic that if we ever did the accounting — if anyone did — we would immediately understand that this entire idea is a mode of ‘fracking the whole environment’ whose costs rise explosively with every moment we continue the process.
These traditionalists worry that a larger block size will raise the minimum amount of computing power required to fully participate in the Bitcoin network’s peer-to-peer process for clearing transactions. To fully participate in this process, a computer needs to receive a copy of every transaction that has ever been made on the network, which can add up to gigabytes of data every month. If the block limit is raised, then running a Bitcoin node will become even more resource-intensive, potentially pricing out smaller players.
Only a species that had gone entirely insane, and consciously intended to wipe out life on Earth would ever consider such a process. But any species that could actively celebrate and expand it — must be understood as both emphatically suicidal and openly omnicidal. 
In short: they intend to kill everything, anything, and themselves — and are hell-bent on the continuous and unlimited expansion of this agenda.
The activity of the bitcoin process and some similar networks are not only burning down the future; they are also obliterating the history of humanity and life on Earth, faster and more aggressively every moment, by destroying the living results and opportunities established by this history, and insuring that the benefits that might otherwise blossom into astonishing ‘interest on investment’, are killed off by the necessity of breeding, operating, heating and cooling millions of machines that do makework for a resource that only exists as numbers in machines.
No one with anything resembling a mind would ever allow, let alone celebrate this, and the fact that our modern cultures are doing both is a symptom more serious than our obsessions with war, ecological atrocity, rape-for-profit, and the generation of other lethal processes such as the automobile, the atomic bomb, nuclear reactors and prisons.
bitcoin is an invisible, self-expanding prison/war that, like fracking ‘hides the damage’ in every place and life on Earth. It is a way of violently undermining the very bases of life on Earth, and the fact that no one is doing the accounting is a sign that the social and environmental intelligences of our species have become actively self-compromising.
Imagine if your immune system started producing new forms of HIV instead of macrophages and antibodies… and you begin to get the picture.
Thankfully, there is a limit to the process, but it’s taking a while to get there. The limit is 21 million bitcoins, at least in the present implementation. What does this mean? Well, it means that, according to some sources, 80% of mineable bitcoins will have been acquired within about a year. It also means that the miner margin will shrink, making the process less attractive. It’s not clear what will take place, or if the tail end of this process can be completely accomplished. It’s also not impossible that the present implementation will begin to transform, or reiterate itself once all bitcoins have been mined.
bitcoin forks into two processes 08.01.17.
Money is cached torture, murder, atrocity, and domination. It represents possible transactions in future time by obliterating living beings and opportunities in present time.
The only ‘value’ of the computation thus accomplished is that it leverages statistical complexity against computational power in order to mathematically throttle block (and thus bitcoin) production. So, we are inventing increasing quantities of work for increasing quantities of computers to do and the easier it becomes, the more we throttle it to make it harder… faster.
Purportedly, all of this bother results in profit, at least in theory. I say in theory because the putative returns require investments… of time, space, electricity, temperature, attention… and… computation. What one invests in one way is lost twice, both in the investment and in what more profitable or noble work might have been done with the same effort or resources.
There are a wide variety of other problems here, from the fact that malware that infects vast numbers of machines has been found mining bitcoin (resource diversion), to the embarrassing ‘sudden disappearance’ of thousands (or occasionally millions) of dollars worth of bitcoins in thefts from ‘exchanges’ or technical bungles (wallet loss).
Why are we purchasing banks of highly specialized computers and heating them up with computational burdens that tax their performance spec and then paying to cool them back down—in order to accomplish nothing useful?
The answer is that we have invented a ‘false problem’ that tens of thousands of machines now work to achieve the result for relatively uninterrupted, and these machines are themselves resources which require resources to build, run, track, back up, and otherwise maintain. How much varies widely by installation, but as you can see in the image that begins this essay, many people are building banks of machines that do nothing but process bitcoin blocks. Nothing else. Just that. And these have to be housed, stored, powered, repaired, attended, backed-up, protected, and cooled.
Bitcoin Energy Usage Analysis.
bitcoin is an essentially mechano-vampiric paradigm where massive amounts of actually usless computation are done with increasing ferocity while producing nothing of any value whatsoever except a kind of pure abstraction of computing having been done, and the glorious ‘record of transactions’ which becomes a veritable church of common computational record—and remains just as meaningless in that guise.
Those who are involved in this racket have chosen to dedicate cash, space, power and other resources to the process. But what is the process? It is to process a meaningless series of processes, ever-more ineffectively, on purpose.
That’s the wrong thing to dedicate resources to, and it produces direct mechanical competition against our own minds, cultures, needs and development. The idea of a homegrown electronic cryptocurrency is not entirely misguided. Personally, I think it would be powerful to develop something that produces value based on merit of actual work, discovery or contribution… accomplished by individuals or collectives. This is something I hope we may see relatively soon. But what bitcoin is and is doing is stridently malformed.
What exactly is profit? A crucial part of the answer is that it is the abstracted remains of obliterated lives, pricelessly irreplaceable ecosystems and precious relationships we never noticed or acknowledged, let alone understood. It is the remains of what might have been revolutionary intelligence, discovery, mutual uplift, evolution, wonder and actual human progress. It is the bodies and remains of animals, human beings and families, dreams of access to new developmental and creative opportunities, and living worlds of possibility that were burnt down and turned into little sheets of paper.
In all too many cases, the ‘next big thing’ is actually the next endlessly self-amplifying graveyard.
It is well-known that a ‘materially successful’ male or female represents an attractive mating partner for a variety of reasons, both profound and superficial in nature. In effect, the ‘standing cache’ of a given person or group is a signal about how effective various aspects of their skills and/or intelligence are in the specific domains that these representations are derived from.
The problem is this: the message is mixed, because their cache is social power… but its sources and functions often begin with atrocities,, some of which reach far back into the history of our people and the land.
“The Kwakiutl called their money objects yaklelwas, which means “bad things,” a word that has the same root as ‘dead bodies” and “intestines.” When they had their potlatch money-destruction ceremonies they said they were “wiping off the shame” from their body, like one wipes off shit, by giving money away or destroying it.(11)”

Note : There are now a large number of cryptocurrencies, each with unique features, benefits and costs of operation. While some of these may utilize similar processes that require vast amounts of computational activity to generate, others do not. I am presently doing some research to understand more about the other systems, some of which are mentioned in the comments.

James A. Donald asked a stupid question:
I can't speak for the participants but quite simply any way you kill a
nazi is a good way. They think people they target are subhuman. So they
earn subhuman treatment from the people they target.
And saying that makes the potential victim just like the victimizer is a
logical fallacy. It's also a sociological fallacy that someone peaceful
whose existence is threated by someone whose violent will continue to be
violent after the threat from their victimizer is exterminated. Whereas
the victimizer... IF they're left to go about their way will simply
commit another act of violence against another victim their ideology
tells them is subhuman.

A person who claims to be a Nazi, albeit actions speak louder than words.
No. Although anyone whose actually lived through the 3rd Reich will tell
you When they said  Vernichtung no one actually thought they meant
Vernichtung and wished the response to the rise of Nazism was proactive.
You're right. I listened to my German Jewish elders who survived I
believe a proactive response is not only appropriate it's necessary.
You can THINK whatever you like. But promulgating it is not the same as
thinking it.
I think recent history comes to mind and the slippery slope that led to
Vernichtung that no one believed would be Vernichtung.
The words Nazi and Fascist have definitions. I use them. Nazi is a bit
archaic. I prefer to refer to it as Hitler-worshiping Fascism.
The 'attack' is existential... Eternal, as Umberto Eco suggested.
You keep going back to people's so-called 'labeling'. If the label fits
the definition...
Conservatives aren't Fascists or Nazis, nor, according to traditional
definition of political conservative, can they be. Fascism is extremism
Refer to Umberto Eco. Fascism is an ideology, a reactionary ideology
without politics. It 'shape-shifts'.
Fascism can UTILIZE right or left modes of analysis, but anarchism,
despite what some might say, is in direct opposition and there can never
be anything such as "Anarcho-Fascism" because, simply, Fascism is the
'cult of traditionalism' and Anarchy is NEVER traditionalism .
My point IS that Fascists and Nazis, by their very existence, have made
the decision "that it's okay to do the same thing to you"... Even if
you've never had one bad thing to say about them or harmed them in any
way except their deluded self-perceived harm because, lets say, you're
black, or Jewish.

promised to attempt to root out corruption . FWIW, his "Little Green

Right. Nazis have no right to be espousing the extermination of people
because of ethnic or other fate-of-birth traits alone.
You can think whatever you fucking well like but once you try to spread
it, you become susceptible to public opinion, and the general sentiment
among most people in the US and Europe is DIE NAZI DIE! Whether the
public is confused and vote for one is a completely different issue.
You're seeing the backlash now.
Existential has a definition, So does Eternal. Look it up if you don't
understand the 'jargon'.
You use the word "Labelled" to describe something that's well-defined. Humans "Label" things. As long as the 'label' fits the well-defined
definition "Label" is simply a loaded word.
ROTF. Absolutely! If you want non-literal discuss this with someone else.
Dead by firearm is dead but Totalitarian is not necessarily Fascist.
Stalin wasn't Fascist. Fascism is a throwback. A 'return to the days of
yesteryear... "Make America Great ... Again". Traditionalism. No matter
the society's traditions. Read Eco. And yes Totalitarianism is
dangerous, but not as dangerous as the IDEOLOGY of Fascism combined with
a totalitarian state. Benign (or at least non-malignant) totalitarianism
is possible. Monarchies tend to be that. Fascism is never benign no
matter what political system it leeches on.
See the bottom where you essentially reiterate this ...
I answered in the follow up. Fascist Socialism is possible. As a matter
of fact most national government who call themselves Socialist are in
some way Fascist...  Fascism and Communism, as I mentioned about
Anarchism, are contradictory.
I'll reiterate my main point "they decide that it's okay to do the same
thing to you" even if you've never done, nor have any interest in,
"Doing a thing" to them. That's why proactive, 'preventative' if you
will, response is an imperative.
Those who don't learn from it are condemned to repeat it. Someone a lot
wiser than  me said that.
A conservative holds traditional values but they ARE mutable in relation
to change of times. For instance a conservative understands that the
internet wasn't part of the founders of the US understanding and
modifying laws to 'compensate' for that doesn't necessarily go against
conserving the constitution in some 'pristine state'. With Fascism it's
NEVER mutable and if the internet interferes with their tradition in any
way it is eliminated. Just as surely as they'd eliminate a Jew or a
Gypsy or any other scapegoat.

@_subject: In Defence of Assaulting Fascists 
"I take no personal gratification in watching physical assault take
place. I recall the trauma of being punched at 14-years old in a racist
incident. I was intimidated for years by even the most frivolous fights
in high-school and even desisted from playing sports for a long time as
a result. I know how intimidating violence can be.
Which is why I believe in violence against fascists.
The New York Times today reported that Richard Spencer won’t be going on
speaking tours for a long time as a result of being assaulted. He’s even
afraid to go out for dinner. Before we conclude that that’s indubitably
a good thing, I’d like to turn to the topic of collaboration.
We expect collaborators to appear in the form of the Devil himself. In
other words, recognizable. But of course that’s far from the reality.
The Biblical story of how Satan himself transmogrifies into the Devil is
itself just as implausible. Collaboration, where it most matters, is
passive. Collaboration is reduced to executing “normal” tasks in a
programmatic manner. Nothing could be more “natural.” This was the
insight of Hannah Arendt’s Eichmann in Jerusalem: modern evil is banal.
It is the work of millions of men and women. As she argues in The
Origins of Totalitarianism, genocide requires the participation of
engineers, physicians, accountants, scientists, journalists, small
business owners, corporate executives and civil servants. It is an
archipelago of labor in the narrowest sense of the term: tedious and
The most effective prophylactic against any infection is to deny it its
conditions of survival. Today our infection is the prospect of
collaboration.  Evil, according to Arendt, is committed by those who
“never make up their minds to be good or evil,” but underlying that is
careerism. Eichmann, the chief architect for the extermination of half
of European Jewry, had “no motives at all” she argued, “except for an
extraordinary diligence in looking out for his personal advancement.”
And the problem, as Arendt pointed out, was that there were too many
Eichmanns. There is no cure for collaboration. The only solution is to
prevent the conditions in which passive collaborators have the excuse to
say that they were only doing their jobs.
There is a crucial lesson to be learned from how Mussolini and Hitler
consolidated power. It wasn’t overnight. It took years. And in those
years paramilitary groups roamed the streets ravaging any potential
threat. The threat of chaos that they incubated was crucial to the
conservative governments’ decisions to permit them into the halls of
total power. Violence, as any good anthropologist would tell you, is
steeped in symbolism. State and, when allowed, non-State violence
intends to send a message “We Are The Only Game In Town.” And in their
violence, they assert their convictions. Citizens, too busy and
exhausted to think politically, are always ready to acquiesce that point
faute de mieux: if someone is violent and angry, then their demands,
even ideology, must be somewhat rooted valid grievances and ideas.
The essence of fascism, as historians like Robert Paxton never fail to
remind us, is not in ideas but in emotions. Robbing fascism of its
virility and hyper masculine pretence is to rob it of its primary
capacity to grow and survive. We have to confront the crucial question:
are we more interested in upholding the slogan “Don’t Be Evil” or in
making sure that no evil occurs? Is instilling fear in the hearts of
fascists or fascist-curious individuals, even at the cost of isolated
violence preferable to allowing fascists to consolidate power and
therefore commit greater atrocities?
In this particular instance, we must utilize fear to our advantage. The
continuation of protests and the show of strength must not only
intimidate fascists, but also send a clear message to the three most
important institutions that fascists require for total power: big
business, media and state institutions. They must be constantly fear any
form of collaboration with Trump’s administration. They must fear how
the nation’s history books will view them but to accomplish that we must
compel them to think that future historians will not be fascists. The
fascist future must be cancelled, today. We can take it from the tip of
fascist reaction today: “The point is that we got a lot of attention,
and that alone creates value.” (Trump, The Art of the Deal, p. 57)
Take for instance a recent example in Egypt. Large large sections of
civil servants and big business sabotaged Morsi’s presidency. Hoping
against the grain that he would be overthrown by the military, they felt
compelled enough to sacrifice their jobs and careers. But the background
to this was fierce street violence against fundamentalist supporters of
Morsi and weekly mass protests. They had mistakenly placed their faith
in the military, but Americans can take comfort in the fact that a
genuine opposition in Congress can represent them politically. Americans
who will be torn about collaboration must likewise feel compelled to
sacrifice their livelihoods and future; but only if the protest and
civil disobedience continue unabated and if there exists a genuine
political opposition in Congress.
We must be ready to meet their intimidation with greater intimidation.
What fascism does is to returns politics to its fundamentals. Those of
us who are united in the right of women and LGBTQ folks to their bodies,
those of us who believe in the right of life for Black, Native, colored
and Muslim communities have to confront that our primary task in the
coming months and years is to defend the most basic of political rights:
life itself. Politics is back to the visceral for those of us who have
long grown accustomed to middle-class bourgeois bubbles. We must consign
bourgeois morality to the ash heap before it does us in."

Hackers Disable Door Locks at Four-Star Hotel, Demand Ransom
The hackers demanded 2 Bitcoins in payment to return control of the
systems back to the hotel -- and the hotel says it had no choice but to pay.
By Jeff Goldman  |  February 02, 2017
Hackers recently breached the internal systems at Austria's four-star,
111-year-old Romantik Seehotel Jagerwirt, according to Bleeping Computer.
The hackers disabled both the hotel's electronic door locks and the
reservation system, meaning that new keys couldn't be generated and
reservations couldn't be checked or confirmed.
They demanded 2 Bitcoins (almost $2,000) to return control of the
systems back to the hotel -- and the hotel says it had no option but to
pay the ransom.
"The house was totally booked with 180 guests, we had no other choice,"
hotel managing director Christoph Brandstaetter told The Local. "Neither
police nor insurance help you in this case."
This was the third recent cyber attack for the hotel, Brandstaetter
said. A fourth attempt soon after was only blocked because computers had
been replaced and new security standards implemented.
"The restoration of our system after the first attack in summer has cost
us several thousand Euros," Brandstaetter said. "We did not get any
money from the insurance so far because none of those to blame could be
In response to the hack, Brandstaetter said the hotel has one unique
security solution in the works. "We are planning at the next room
refurbishment for old-fashioned door locks with real keys," he said.
"Just like 111 years ago at the time of our great-grandfathers."
According to the results of a recent 451 Research survey of almost 1,000
enterprise IT buyers worldwide, 50 percent of respondents said security
is the top impediment for IoT deployments.
Still, enterprises are moving ahead with IoT initiatives, with 90
percent of enterprises planning to increase IoT spending over the next year.
Respondents' mean IoT-related spending is expected to increase by 33
percent over the next 12 months.
While 54 percent of respondents said a lack of trained IoT staff is not
an issue for their organizations, 46 percent said they're having
difficulty filling IoT-related positions.
"When it comes to IoT adoption, pragmatism rules," 451 Research director
Laura DiDio said in a statement. "The survey data indicates enterprises
currently use IoT for practical technology purposes that have an
immediate and tangible impact on daily operational business
efficiencies, economies of scale and increasing the revenue stream."

@_subject: Dozens of iOS TLS-enabled Apps Subject to MITM Attacks 
While developing a tool for evaluating mobile application security,
researchers at Sudo Security Group Inc. found out something unexpected.
Seventy-six popular applications in Apple's iOS App Store, they
discovered, had implemented encrypted communications with their back-end
services in such a way that user information could be intercepted by a
man-in-the-middle attack. The applications could be fooled by a forged
certificate sent back by a proxy, allowing their Transport Layer
Security to be unencrypted and examined as it is passed over the Internet.
The discovery was initially the result of bulk analysis done by Sudo's
verify.ly, a service that performs bulk static analysis of application
binaries from Apple's App Store. Will Strafach, president of Sudo,
verified the applications discovered by the system were vulnerable in
the lab, using a network proxy configured with its own Secure Socket
Layer certificate.
Ars independently verified that several applications discovered by
Strafach were vulnerable. These sorts of vulnerabilities are nothing
new; thousands of applications have had incorporated bugs that caused
TLS to become vulnerable to attack, both on iOS and Android. But the
fact that they persist even as Apple tries to push developers toward
greater security is disconcerting, to say the least—especially in
applications that could expose financial or health data along with user
The data exposed by the vulnerability in each of the applications varied
in sensitivity. For just less than half—33 of the applications—the risk
was relatively low, as most of the data was "partially sensitive
analytics data," Strafach said. These apps included a number of
third-party "uploader" apps for Snapchat (which exposed Snapchat
usernames and passwords) and the Vice News app, among others.
In 24 cases, the exposed data included login credentials or session
tokens that would allow an attacker to hijack the account associated
with the application, though those accounts were not tied to highly
sensitive data. However, the remaining 19 applications left sensitive
data exposed to attack. In these cases, Strafach "confirmed ability to
intercept financial or medical service login credentials and/or session
authentication tokens for logged in users."
The names of these apps are not currently being published. "Currently,
this list is only available to limited parties due to sensitivity,"
Strafach wrote. "I have been in touch with MITRE and will follow up
later with a listing of the CVE IDs for affected iOS applications of
which data interception would be considered medium risk or high risk."
The same old story
Until recently, many mobile applications didn't protect much of the data
sent to their back-end interfaces. When we looked at passive monitoring
of mobile applications in 2014, we discovered many applications that
were passing session tokens and other sensitive data in the clear. And
for some developers that have moved to secure connections, poor
verification of TLS certificates has continued to be problem.
Even security-focused applications have run into trouble with TLS
validation, including the two-factor authentication provider Duo. In
2015, Duo issued a security advisory warning that one version of their
iOS application had left open a TLS vulnerability. Many secure
applications avoid the issue by using "pinned" certificates hard-coded
into applications, which allows them to avoid interception of the
certificate hand-shake at the beginning of a TLS session. But that may
not be practical for other applications.
Apple has been pushing iOS developers to use App Transport Security
(ATS) to secure data transmitted by applications sold through the App
Store. In December, Apple extended the deadline for application
developers to implement ATS. ATS uses TLS v. 1.2 and requires stronger
cryptography (AES and SHA-2), as well as "forward secrecy" to protect
past transactions if a certificate is compromised. But ATS doesn't
ensure that applications properly verify the certificate—just that the
developer uses TLS to begin with.
ATS does allow for use of Certificate Transparency—a public "log" of
verified certificates. Google is also pushing the service and is
planning to use Certificate Transparency to enforce validation of
trusted web sites by October 2017. But not all certificate authorities
(let alone site and app operators) have signed off on implementing CT,
so its adoption by app developer is still in its infancy. And if Apple
tries to enforce Certificate Transparency now, it could actually cause
some applications to become less secure, Strafach said. Developers
"would not be able to utilize certificate pinning for their connections,
and they could not trust otherwise untrusted certificates which may be
required for intranet connections within an enterprise using an in-house
The one ray of sunshine for end-users is that man-in-the-middle attacks
(other than those by state actors) are possible only when connected to
the Internet via an untrusted Wi-Fi connection. If you're connected
using cellular broadband or a trusted wireless network,
man-in-the-middle attacks are highly unlikely—though attackers can use
Wi-Fi network spoofing to fool a device into connecting to a malicious
network, as Ars has demonstrated in the lab in the past.

@_subject: Chrome 56 Adds Bluetooth Snitch API (will tell you when your fridge 
When Google popped out Chrome 56 at the end of January it was keen to
remind us it's making the web safer by flagging non-HTTPS sites. But
Google made little effort to publicise another feature that's decidedly
less friendly to privacy, because it lets websites ask about users'
Bluetooth devices and harvest information from them through the browser.
That's more a pitch to developers, as is clear in this YouTube video
from Pete LePage of the Chrome Developers team.
"Until now, the ability to communicate with Bluetooth devices has been
possible only for native apps. With Chrome 56, your Web app can
communicate with nearby Bluetooth devices in a private and secure
manner, using the Web Bluetooth API," Google shares in the video. "The
Web Bluetooth API uses the GATT [Generic Attribute Profile - ed]
protocol, which enables your app to connect to devices such as light
bulbs, toys, heart-rate monitors, LED displays and more, with just a few
lines of JavaScript."
In other words, the API lets websites ask your browser "what Bluetooth
devices can you see," find out what your fridge, and so on, is capable
of, and interact with it.

@_subject: Suspicious Sockets Layer - CloudFlare's half-baked SSL 
"We were inspired to collect the data on this page after reading this
report: Phishers using CloudFlare for SSL. Also see this technical
analysis (PDF, 545 KB) on the use of SSL by CloudFlare and similar
services. The CloudFlare certificates we found all had the common name
in the same style as the "ssl2796.cloudflare.com" shown in that Netcraft
report. The "ssl2796" in the name is a CloudFlare tracking ID in the
110,481 root domains we found that use "standard" (not "universal")
CloudFlare certificates. Every root domain also has a subdomain wildcard
line (*.example.com), which we deleted to save space.
We compiled this list by attempting a handshake with the CloudFlare
domains in our database. The "standard" certificates on this page (with
"ssl" in front of the number instead of "sni") mean that the domain has
a paid account at CloudFlare. Paid accounts make up about five percent
of the domains that use CloudFlare, according to news reports. It's all
a marketing effort anyway, whether paid or free. There is no such thing
as "secure" SSL when you have potential Men-In-The-Middle at scores of
data centers around the world. Local authorities could be sniffing the
plaintext available at these data centers, and CloudFlare wouldn't have
a clue. (Their "data centers" are typically a rack or two of equipment
that CloudFlare ships to a real data center, along with installation
instructions.) We asked CloudFlare to confirm that sniffing is possible
at these so-called "data centers," but they didn't respond. By now we're
wondering if there's a plaintext Ethernet port at the back of their
equipment rack that makes interception easy and convenient. If so, it
would make no difference whether the origin server has its own certificate.
CloudFlare may claim that there is no way plaintext can be accessed from
their equipment racks, despite the fact that some sort of decrypt and
re-encrypt must occur there due to the nature of their role as a CDN.
After all, CloudFlare has engineers who come up with clever techniques
to enhance SSL. But imagine that you are a government regulator in a
country where a big ISP hosts a CloudFlare "data center." Your job is to
consider the Internet in terms of public safety and current laws, and
you go to that ISP with a list of CloudFlare-user domains you want
blocked. The ISP replies that everything is encrypted, and CloudFlare
traffic cannot be intercepted. In other words, nothing can be done about
the ISIS sites, carders, booters, gamblers, escorts, phishers, malware,
and copyright infringers that CloudFlare protects. How would you
respond? It's fairly obvious — you ask this ISP to block the CloudFlare
IP addresses used by the offending domains (this is already happening in
Russia). If those IPs change, then block CloudFlare's entire IP space,
and continue to monitor the situation. If CloudFlare's traffic still
gets through, you ask the ISP to pull the plug on CloudFlare's racks.
This is why CloudFlare will add a plaintext port to their own hardware
someday, if they haven't already.
The CloudFlare certificates below encrypt the traffic only between the
browser and CloudFlare. The traffic between the original web server and
CloudFlare remains unencrypted unless the web server owner has his own
certificate installed on his machine. Almost everyone who browses a
https domain reached from CloudFlare is unaware that just half of the
route is encrypted. When they see the padlock on their screen, they feel
that everything is safe. This is why phishers love CloudFlare's SSL.
It's easy to use for a cybercriminal with numerous domains hidden behind
the privacy services of various registrars. Moreover, the subdomain
wildcard option on each domain is handy for obscuring a URL in a
phishing email.
Suppose that grandpa, age 90, gets an official-looking email that
advises him to immediately change his password. He clicks on the URL in
the email and ends up at bankofamerica.q4.es. This page is an excellent
imitation of the Bank of America pages he remembers, and there is also
that nice little SSL padlock in the corner of the address bar. Would he
fill out the form? Probably, because he doesn't realize that he's at a
subdomain of q4.es and is entering his old and new password into a fake
page for the benefit of a phisher.
As if the "standard" certificates aren't enough of a problem, there are
also 4.6 million "universal" certificates that present bigger problems.
All you need for a free CloudFlare account is a domain and an email
address. Little countries and even some little islands all have their
own top-level domain these days. Rich people can buy a generic top-level
domain. Many registrars around the world are pleased to sell these ccTLD
and gTLD registrations. It's a cash cow for everyone, but especially for
bad guys. The same situation exists for anyone who needs a throwaway
email address that's nearly impossible to trace.
Now add CloudFlare's free fly-by-night "universal" SSL. When you email
CloudFlare to open your new account, they ask for your domain. Then they
scrape your zone file from whatever dubious nameservers are listed at
your dubious registrar. Without asking, they assign you a dubious
"universal" SSL certificate. All of these "universal" certificates
include that magical wildcard subdomain that invites so much mischief.
Some critics are referring to these CloudFlare certificates as
"fraudulent" because the domain ownership validation (a necessary
component of the SSL standard) is achieved only from CloudFlare's
initial access to the zone file.
With the paid accounts, there are payment records associated with a
CloudFlare customer. But with free CloudFlare accounts, everything is
too easy for bad guys, and the information about who's really behind a
domain is frequently beyond the reach of law enforcement. The problem is
that Silicon Valley is too self-serving. After the embarrassing NSA
leaks, Google declared that everyone should look for a little padlock on
their screen when they visit a website. Even your cat pictures should
sport a little padlock these days! Now CloudFlare comes along and hopes
to pave their way toward an IPO by giving away more free padlocks than
anyone else. But by now the padlocks are almost meaningless. The NSA
probably finds this amusing.
The domains shown in blue were not using CloudFlare nameservers when
they were checked on 2017-02-02. Additional information is available for
these domains and their certificates. Just paste the domain (without the
certificate number) into the search box."

Who needs Cloudflare in these new golden oldie days of TrumpelOrangeSkin
when the DOJay can just plain old stalk your contributors
“The subpoena claimed that the information it requested would be used at
the trial of the jailed journalist. However, the identities of, and the
amounts donated by, the journalist’s supporters are completely
irrelevant to the charges levied against the journalist,” the group says
in its filing. Indeed, no such information was presented at trial. The
real purpose was to “unlawfully surveil the donors in violation of the
First Amendment,” the suit says.
“Learning that these records were sought and obtained was highly
unsettling,” said Kevin Gallagher, Free Barrett Brown’s former director
said in a statement. “If we don’t send a message to the government that
it’s not okay to target private legal defense efforts, then they will
continue to get away with these sort of things.”
“The donations were acts of political expression, showing the donors’
frustrations with what they perceived to be government bullying and
prosecutorial overreach,” the lawsuit said. “Donations made in support
of litigation are protected by the First Amendment. The donors violated
no law by sending money to support Mr. Brown’s legal defense, and
instead were exercising their constitutionally protected rights.”

“I learned how to play Monopoly from my grandmother. She was a wonderful
person. She raised six children. She was a widow by the time that I knew
her. But she was the most ruthless Monopoly player I have ever known in
my life.
She understood that the name of the game was to acquire.
When she played and I got my initial money from the bank, I would just
try to hold onto it, because I didn’t want to lose any of it. She spent
everything, bought stuff she landed on as soon as she could, and she’d
mortgage it to buy more stuff. And of course, the way the game goes,
eventually she would accumulate everything. She would be the master of
the board. She understood that money was how you keep score in the game,
possessions are a matter of survival.
And she beat me every time. And at the end of the game she would look at
me and she’d say, “One day you’ll learn how to play the game.” She was
kind of cocky, my grandmother.
When I was about ten, I played every day through the Summer holidays
with a friend. It dawned on me the only way to win was total commitment
to acquisition. That summer I learned how to play the game. And by the
time autumn rolled around, I was more ruthless than even my grandmother.
I went to play her, and I was willing to do anything to win. I was
willing to bend the rules. I played with sweaty palms. Slowly, cunningly
I exposed the soft underbelly of my grandmother’s weakness.
Relentlessly, inexorably, I drove her off the board.
The game does strange things to you. I can still remember the day like
yesterday. I looked at my grandmother. This is the person who taught me
how to play.  She was an old woman by now. She was a widow.  She had
raised my mother. She loved me.
And I took everything she had. I destroyed her financially and
psychologically. I watched her give her last dollar and quit in utter
defeat. This was the greatest moment of my life.
And then she had one more lesson to teach me, my grandmother.
Then she said to me, “Now it all goes back in the box.” It all goes back
in the box.  All of the houses and hotels, Mayfair and Park Lane, all of
those railway stations and utilities, all of that wonderful money. It
all goes back in the box,” she said.
But I didn’t want it all to go back in the box. I wanted to leave the
board out permanently — bronze it maybe, as a memorial to what I had
See, when she said, “It all goes back in the box,” it was kind of a way
of saying to me,
“None of it’s really yours. It doesn’t belong to you. You don’t own any
of it. You just used it for a little while. And now it all goes back in
the box.  And next time it’ll all go to somebody else. That’s the way
the game works.
So when you play the game, don’t forget this one lesson. When the game
comes to an end....
...and the game always comes to an end, the stuff all goes back in the box.”
There is a simple, two-word question we tend not to ask ourselves. “Then
When I’ve reached the top, then what? When I have it all, then what?
When I finally have enough, when I am financially secure, when I’ve got
the sought after promotion, made the ultimate purchase, got the ideal
home, assured financial security, and climbed the ladder of success to
the highest rung, and then the thrill wears off–and it will wear
off—sooner or later you’re faced with the nagging question, “Then what?”

If he was a shade or two darker, or a Muslim, So-Called "President"
Trump would be tweeting about it and saying US courts are endangering
Americans. Americans ARE their OWN worst Enemies. Greed does that.
"A Georgia man who has shown support for white supremacist groups is
being investigated by the FBI after authorities say he drove himself to
a hospital for exposure to ricin, a deadly toxin.
William Christopher Gibbs, of Morganton, was jailed on reckless conduct
and probation violation charges since taking himself to the hospital
last Thursday and saying he had ricin on his hands. A search of his car
tested positive for the substance, according to the Fannin County
Sheriff's Office.
"I think it was all contained inside his vehicle, just a small amount of
something I think he had been experimenting with," Sheriff Dane Kirby
told Fox5Atlanta.
"It was inside his vehicle and somehow he claimed he had exposed himself
to what he made, got scared, and went to the hospital."
Thousands of first responders exposed to deadly ricin in training
About 100 officers later swarmed Gibbs' home, with officials in HAZMAT
suits inspecting the area as baffled neighbors looked on.
Ricin is a naturally occurring toxin found in the seeds of castor oil
plants, which can be lethal even in the smallest doses if it is refined
and purified. Terrorists and terror groups have been known to use it,
and letters containing ricin have been mailed to politicians including
former President Barack Obama and former New York City Mayor Michael
Bloomberg. The poison was also a plot point on the TV drug drama
"Breaking Bad."
It remains unclear why Gibbs, 27, was toting the toxin or how he
obtained it.  There was no evidence the ricin had used or that the
public was at risk, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Georgia
John Horn said.

(See the article for a pic of this wussy little fascist mama's boy)
A Facebook page that matches Gibbs' appearance and description has
dozens of posts supporting the Georgia Church Of Creativity — part of
the Creativity Movement, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has
designated as a white supremacist group. The movement champions what it
considers the superior "creativity" of the white race.
Many photos on the Facebook page show Gibbs wearing a patch with the
local chapter's logo and the slogan, "Mobilize Nature's Finest." He is
also seen standing in front of a flag for the group.
Another photo shows a drawing of a tree with the Creativity logo on it.
Gibbs wrote in a caption, "100 years from now when someone finds one of
these trees thay (sic) will know that there was once a White Race."
The page also includes memes supporting the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan
Brotherhood, and mocking Jews and blacks. The biography includes the
phrase "RaHoWa," a white supremacist term for "racial holy war."
The Facebook page lists Gibbs' employment as a machine operator at
Pilgrim's Pride, a Brazilian-owned food company.

"Donald Trump's administration has fired the White House's chief

Cory Louie, who was appointed under President Obama, was reportedly
forced to resign and escorted from the building late last week.
His dismissal came shortly after it emerged that Mr Trump was still
using an unsecured and outdated Android phone to tweet - which could
make him particularly vulnerable to hackers.
The circumstances surrounding Mr Louie's departure remain unclear, but
ZDNet reported that he was “escorted out from his office in the
Eisenhower Executive Office Building across the street from the West Wing".
He was accused of "poor management", amid what was described as a
“toxic” working environment, the technology news site said. Mr Louie's LinkedIn profile remains unchanged at the time of writing,
and reports of his dismissal are yet to be publicly confirmed by the
White House.
Remaining staff have “targets on their back” and are afraid of speaking
out, calling the actions a “witch hunt” for former Obama appointees, a
source who wished to remain nameless told ZDNet. After holding various security positions at Dropbox and Google, Mr Louie
joined the White House as part of former President Obama's
cyber-security national action plan, which created a federal chief
information security officer (CISO) position to oversee the government's
internal cyber-security strategy..."

Site check, not a Cloudflare Honeypot:
Article with links:
"In recent weeks we have witnessed a broad reincarnation of the women’s
movement as women of all races and nationalities have taken up the
mantle of feminism for a new generation while staging protests all over
the world. While this rebirth of feminism is important and necessary, it
isn’t always intersectional. In addition to sexism, women of color and
black women in particular, carry the added burden of racism, misogyny
and deep-rooted toxic masculinity within our own culture. It is in that
spirit that activist, Niecee X formed the Black Women’s Defense League
as a coalition of women of color from all walks of life on the path to
total liberation.
Black women, especially within the “woke” community, sometimes face the
unique challenge of having to defend our men while also defending
ourselves from them. What happens when our allies in the fight for
racial equality also harbor dangerous, sexist ideals? The internal
conflict is real. When confronted with this tension, Niecee broke off
from the black advocacy groups that she had been a part of to form a new
organization focused specifically on the obstacles faced by women of
color. In an interview with Vice, the activist described the impetus
that inspired her to start the organization. "There were issues with an
individual that I had been dealing with romantically," she said of a man
she met within Dallas's black activist community, "and there was some
violence that occurred between him and me." The alleged abuse resulted
in the miscarriage of a pregnancy. When she brought these allegations to
the attention of the organization’s leadership, she was accused of
fabricating the story, publicly disparaged on social media and
ultimately kicked out of the group.
For black women who are caught in the crossfire between racism from
outside of the community and patriarchy from within, the Black Women's
Defense League encourages women to stand their ground and defend
themselves. According to the group’s Facebook Page, “BWDL focus’ on
self-defense through martial arts and other hand-to-hand combat
techniques armed training with various types of artillery including
knife fighting, marksmanship, and weapons of opportunity. BWDL also
engages in emergency preparedness, urban survival training, ...and
battered women’s rescue.”
The self-described womanist organization’s mission extends beyond black
feminism. “We believe in protecting our families and communities
alongside our brothers and all oppressed people worldwide. In our
communities, black men and women must function as two vital parts of the
same body. BWDL seeks to refine, train and prepare women for a symbiotic
relationship that will truly enrich our children, our lives and make a
positive impact on our collective realities.”
It is clear that for black women, the movement for liberation must be
fought on two fronts. The Black Women's Defense League stands for both."

Sounds familiar somehow...
"We've all heard anecdotes about trolling on Wikipedia and other social
platforms, but rarely has anyone been able to quantify levels and
origins of online abuse. That's about to change. Researchers with
Alphabet tech incubator Jigsaw worked with Wikimedia Foundation to
analyze 100,000 comments left on English-language Wikipedia. They found
predictable patterns behind who will launch personal attacks and when.
The goal of the research team was to lay the groundwork for an automated
system to "reduce toxic discussions" on Wikipedia. The team's work could
one day lead to the creation of a warning system for moderators. The
researchers caution that this system would require more research to
implement, but they have released a paper with some fascinating early
To make the supervised machine-learning task simple, the Jigsaw
researchers focused exclusively on ad hominem or personal attacks, which
are relatively easy to identify. They defined personal attacks as
directed at a commenter (i.e., "you suck"), directed at a third party
("Bill sucks"), quoting an attack ("Bill says Henri sucks"), or just
"another kind of attack or harassment." They used Crowdflower to
crowdsource the job of reviewing 100,000 Wikipedia comments made between
2004-2015. Ultimately, they used over 4,000 Crowdflower workers to
complete the task, and each comment was annotated by 10 different people
as an attack or not.
Once the researchers had their dataset, they trained a logistic
regression algorithm to recognize whether a comment was a personal
attack or not. "With testing, we found that a fully trained model
achieves better performance in predicting whether an edit is a personal
attack than the combined average of three human crowd-workers," they
write in a summary of their paper on Medium.
Who is launching personal attacks?
The researchers unleashed their algorithm on Wikipedia comments made
during 2015, constantly checking results for accuracy. Almost
immediately, they found that they could debunk the time-worn idea that
anonymity leads to abuse. Although anonymous comments are "six times
more likely to be an attack," they represent less than half of all
attacks on Wikipedia. "Similarly, less than half of attacks come from
users with little prior participation," the researchers write in their
paper. "Perhaps surprisingly, approximately 30% of attacks come from
registered users with over a 100 contributions." In other words, a third
of all personal attacks come from regular Wikipedia editors who
contribute several edits per month. Personal attacks seem to be baked
into Wikipedia culture.
The researchers also found that an outsized percentage of attacks come
from a very small number of "highly toxic" Wikipedia contributors. A
whopping 9% of attacks in 2015 came from just 34 users who had made 20
or more personal attacks during the year. "Significant progress could be
made by moderating a relatively small number of frequent attackers," the
researchers note. This finding bolsters the idea that problems in online
communities often come from a small minority of highly vocal users.
The algorithm was also able to identify a phenomenon often called the
"pile-on." They found that attacking comments are 22 times more likely
to occur close to another attacking comment. "Personal attacks cluster
together in time," the researchers write. "Perhaps because one personal
attack triggers another." Though this shouldn't be surprising to anyone
who has ever taken a peek at Twitter, being able to quantify this
behavior is a boon for machine learning. It means that an algorithm
might be able to identify a pile-on before it really blows up, and
moderators could come in to de-escalate before things get really ugly.
Depressingly, the study also found that very few personal attacks are
moderated. Only 17.9% of personal attacks lead to a warning or ban.
Attackers are more likely to be moderated if they have launched a number
of attacks or have been moderated before. But still, this is an abysmal
rate of moderation for the most obvious and blatant form of abuse that
can happen in a community.
The researchers conclude their paper by calling for more research.
Wikipedia has released a dump of all talk-page comments to the site
between 2004-1015 via Figshare, so other researchers will have access to
the same dataset that the Jigsaw team did. Understanding how attacks
affect other users is urgent, say the researchers. Do repeated attacks
lead to user abandonment? Are some groups attacked more often than
others? The more we know, the closer we get to having good tools to aid
moderators. Such tools, the researchers write, "might be used to help
moderators build dashboards that better visualize the health of
Wikipedia conversations or to develop systems to better triage comments
for review."

I would guess it's what their policy always was. If you think their

harassment complaints against them that are verifiable. If you don't
harass people (and twitter knows all ur tweetz whether or not you delete
them), you don't get suspended. That the way the world works irl, and
that's the way it works on twitter afaict. Not Sure what happens if you
hit the report button as an 'unwanted follow'. I suspect if they get
enough of those clicks they MIGHT have a look at the account to check

twitter half-automagically rejects you with a snap review by someone who

@_subject: What IS "Fascism"? 
[My note: If you read this carefully you will note that one of the
endearing traits of Fascism is "Shapeshifting". It really has no fixed
ideology. It morphs to suit whatever society it infests. It relies on
popular opinion of whatever is 'wrong' about a society and utilizes
reactionary behavior to accomplish it's goals. No political ideology is
required. It's parasitic to political ideologies using the (snigger)
"Little Man"(Wilhelm Reich) to make the "Big Man" bigger.]
A reading: Originally published in 1997.
[Author’s Note: I am skeptical of efforts to produce a “definition” of
fascism. As a dynamic historical current, fascism has taken many
different forms, and has evolved dramatically in some ways. To
understand what fascism has encompassed as a movement and a system of
rule, we have to look at its historical context and development–as a
form of counter-revolutionary politics that first arose in early
twentieth-century Europe in response to rapid social upheaval, the
devastation of World War I, and the Bolshevik Revolution. The following
paragraphs are intended as an initial, open-ended sketch.]
Fascism is a form of extreme right-wing ideology that celebrates the
nation or the race as an organic community transcending all other
loyalties. It emphasizes a myth of national or racial rebirth after a
period of decline or destruction. To this end, fascism calls for a
“spiritual revolution” against signs of moral decay such as
individualism and materialism, and seeks to purge “alien” forces and
groups that threaten the organic community. Fascism tends to celebrate
masculinity, youth, mystical unity, and the regenerative power of
violence. Often, but not always, it promotes racial superiority
doctrines, ethnic persecution, imperialist expansion, and genocide. At
the same time, fascists may embrace a form of internationalism based on
either racial or ideological solidarity across national boundaries.
Usually fascism espouses open male supremacy, though sometimes it may
also promote female solidarity and new opportunities for women of the
privileged nation or race.
Fascism’s approach to politics is both populist–in that it seeks to
activate “the people” as a whole against perceived oppressors or
enemies–and elitist–in that it treats the people’s will as embodied in a
select group, or often one supreme leader, from whom authority proceeds
downward. Fascism seeks to organize a cadre-led mass movement in a drive
to seize state power. It seeks to forcibly subordinate all spheres of
society to its ideological vision of organic community, usually through
a totalitarian state. Both as a movement and a regime, fascism uses mass
organizations as a system of integration and control, and uses organized
violence to suppress opposition, although the scale of violence varies
Fascism is hostile to Marxism, liberalism, and conservatism, yet it
borrows concepts and practices from all three. Fascism rejects the
principles of class struggle and workers’ internationalism as threats to
national or racial unity, yet it often exploits real grievances against
capitalists and landowners through ethnic scapegoating or
radical-sounding conspiracy theories. Fascism rejects the liberal
doctrines of individual autonomy and rights, political pluralism, and
representative government, yet it advocates broad popular participation
in politics and may use parliamentary channels in its drive to power.
Its vision of a “new order” clashes with the conservative attachment to
tradition-based institutions and hierarchies, yet fascism often
romanticizes the past as inspiration for national rebirth.
Fascism has a complex relationship with established elites and the
non-fascist right. It is never a mere puppet of the ruling class, but an
autonomous movement with its own social base. In practice, fascism
defends capitalism against instability and the left, but also pursues an
agenda that sometimes clashes with capitalist interests in significant
ways. There has been much cooperation, competition, and interaction
between fascism and other sections of the right, producing various
hybrid movements and regimes.
Author’s postscript, December 2016.
In the nineteen years since I wrote “What is fascism?,” right-wing
politics have continued to evolve, and my thinking about fascism has
evolved as well. In particular, my concept of fascism has broadened with
regard to the following points in the above sketch:
1. “Fascism…celebrates the nation or race as an organic community
transcending all other loyalties…” I now believe the category of fascism
should be extended to include some movements for which nation and race
are secondary or irrelevant, but which promote a myth of collective
rebirth around a shared culture or ideology, notably membership in a
religious group. This includes certain totalitarian branches of the
Christian right, Islamic right, Jewish right, and so on.
2. “Fascism seeks to organize a cadre-led mass movement in a drive to
seize state power.” Some fascist movements, notably the European New
Right and currents influenced by it, have deferred state power as a goal
in favor of a “metapolitical” strategy. This means a long-term effort to
transform the political culture, as a precondition to transforming
institutions and systems of power.
3. Fascism “seeks to forcibly subordinate all spheres of society…usually
through a totalitarian state.” Over the past half century, diverse
branches of the far right—including several branches of neonazism—have
rejected big centralized states in favor of various moves to
decentralize political power. These currents represent forms of what I
have called “social totalitarianism,” which seek to impose total
ideological control through local governments and/or non-state
institutions, such as church and family. I believe this represents a
major shift in fascist politics, and one that has been overlooked by
many scholars.
4. “[F]ascism defends capitalism against instability and the left…” Some
writers have argued that German National Socialism challenged the basic
economic principles of capitalism, by replacing the system of industrial
wage labor with a system of slave labor in which workers on a mass scale
were intentionally worked to death. This interpretation, coupled with
the rise of anticapitalist ideology among some neofascists, has raised
the question whether fascism might in some circumstances replace
capitalism with another form of class rule—or with a chaotic breakdown
of socio-economic systems.

to recent political developments, see my essays “Two Ways of Looking at
Fascism” [

@_subject: But but Moooslems! [TriggerWarning: Fundie xtian child-forker bashing] 
Washington Post: Why does the United States still let 12-year-olds get
Michelle DeMello walked into the clerk’s office in Colorado thinking for
sure someone would save her.
She was 16 and pregnant. Her Christian community in Green Mountain Falls
was pressuring her family to marry her off to her 19-year-old boyfriend.
She didn’t think she had the right to say no to the marriage after the
mess she felt she’d made. “I could be the example of the shining whore
in town, or I could be what everybody wanted me to be at that moment and
save my family a lot of honor,” DeMello said. She assumed that the clerk
would refuse to approve the marriage. The law wouldn’t allow a minor to
marry, right?
Wrong, as DeMello, now 42, learned.
While most states set 18 as the minimum marriage age, exceptions in
every state allow children younger than 18 to marry, typically with
parental consent or judicial approval. How much younger? Laws in 27
states do not specify an age below which a child cannot marry.
Unchained At Last, a nonprofit I founded to help women resist or escape
forced marriage in the United States, spent the past year collecting
marriage license data from 2000 to 2010, the most recent year for which
most states were able to provide information. We learned that in 38
states, more than 167,000 children — almost all of them girls, some as
young 12 — were married during that period, mostly to men 18 or older.
Twelve states and the District of Columbia were unable to provide
information on how many children had married there in that decade. Based
on the correlation we identified between state population and child
marriage, we estimated that the total number of children wed in America
between 2000 and 2010 was nearly 248,000.
Despite these alarming numbers, and despite the documented consequences
of early marriages, including negative effects on health and education
and an increased likelihood of domestic violence, some state lawmakers
have resisted passing legislation to end child marriage — because they
wrongly fear that such measures might unlawfully stifle religious
freedom or because they cling to the notion that marriage is the best
solution for a teen pregnancy.
In this way, U.S. lawmakers are strongly at odds with U.S. foreign
policy. The U.S. Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls , released
last year by the State Department, lists reducing child, early and
forced marriage as a key goal. The strategy includes harsh words about
marriage before 18, declaring it a “human rights abuse” that “produces
devastating repercussions for a girl’s life, effectively ending her
childhood” by forcing her “into adulthood and motherhood before she is
physically and mentally mature.” The State Department pointed to the
developing world, where 1 in 3 girls is married by age 18, and 1 in 9 is
married by 15.
While the numbers at home are nowhere near that dire, they are alarming.
Many of the children married between 2000 and 2010 were wed to adults
significantly older than they were, the data shows. At least 31 percent
were married to a spouse age 21 or older. (The actual number is probably
higher, as some states did not provide spousal ages.) Some children were
married at an age, or with a spousal age difference, that constitutes
statutory rape under their state’s laws. In Idaho, for example, someone
18 or older who has sex with a child under 16 can be charged with a
felony and imprisoned for up to 25 years. Yet data from Idaho — which
had the highest rate of child marriage of the states that provided data
— shows that some 55 girls under 16 were married to men 18 or older
between 2000 and 2010.
Many of the states that provided data included categories such as “14
and younger,” without specifying exactly how much younger some brides
and grooms were. Thus, the 12-year-olds we found in Alaska, Louisiana
and South Carolina’s data might not have been the youngest children wed
in America between 2000 and 2010. Also, the data we collected did not
account for children wed in religious-only ceremonies or taken overseas
to be married, situations that we at Unchained often see.
Most states did not provide identifying information about the children,
but Unchained has seen child marriage in nearly every American culture
and religion, including Christian, Jewish, Muslim and secular
communities. We have seen it in families who have been in America for
generations and immigrant families from all over the world. In my
experience, parents who marry off their minor children often are
motivated by cultural or religious traditions; a desire to control their
child’s behavior or sexuality; money (a bride price or dowry); or
immigration-related reasons (for instance, when a child sponsors a
foreign spouse). And, of course, many minors marry of their own volition
— even though in most realms of life, our laws do not allow children to
make such high-stakes adult decisions.
Parental control over her sexuality was why Sara Siddiqui, 36, was
married at 15. Her father discovered that she had a boyfriend from a
different cultural background and told her she’d be “damned forever” if
she lost her virginity outside of marriage, even though she was still a
virgin. He arranged her Islamic wedding to a stranger, 13 years her
senior, in less than one day; her civil marriage in Nevada followed when
she was 16 and six months pregnant. “I couldn’t even drive yet when I
was handed over to this man,” said Siddiqui, who was trapped in her
marriage for 10 years. “I wasn’t ready to take care of myself, and I was
thrown into taking care of a husband and being a mother.”
Minors such as Siddiqui can easily be forced into marriage or forced to
stay in a marriage. Adults being pressured in this way have options,
including access to domestic-violence shelters. But a child who leaves
home is considered a runaway; the police try to return her to her family
and could even charge our organization criminally if we were to get
involved. Most domestic-violence shelters do not accept minors, and
youth shelters typically notify parents that their children are there.
Child-protective services are usually not a solution, either:
Caseworkers point out that preventing legal marriages is not in their
Those fleeing a forced marriage often have complex legal needs, but for
children, obtaining legal representation is extremely difficult. Even if
they can afford to pay attorney’s fees, contracts with children,
including retainer agreements, generally can be voided by the child,
making them undesirable clients to lawyers. Further, children typically
are not allowed to file legal actions in their own names.
Regardless of whether the union was the child’s or the parents’ idea,
marriage before 18 has catastrophic, lifelong effects on a girl,
undermining her health, education and economic opportunities while
increasing her risk of experiencing violence.
Women who marry at 18 or younger face a 23 percent higher risk of heart
attack, diabetes, cancer and stroke than do women who marry between ages
19 and 25, partly because early marriage can lead to added stress and
forfeited education. Women who wed before 18 also are at increased risk
of developing various psychiatric disorders, even when controlling for
socio-demographic factors.
American girls who marry before 19 are 50 percent more likely than their
unmarried peers to drop out of high school and four times less likely to
graduate from college. A girl who marries young is 31 percentage points
more likely to live in poverty when she is older, a striking figure that
appears to be unrelated to preexisting differences in such girls. And,
according to a global study, women who marry before 18 are three times
more likely to be beaten by their spouses than women who wed at 21 or older.
Ending child marriage should be simple. Every state can pass the
legislation I’ve helped write to eliminate exceptions that allow
marriage before age 18 — or set the marriage age higher than 18, in
states where the age of majority is higher. New Jersey is the closest
state to doing this, with a bill advancing in the legislature that would
end all marriage before 18. Massachusetts recently introduced a similar
But when Virginia passed a bill last year to end child marriage,
legislators added an exception for emancipated minors as young as 16,
even though the devastating effects of marriage before 18 do not
disappear when a girl is emancipated. Bills introduced last year in New
York and Maryland languished and eventually died, though Maryland’s was
just reintroduced. Other states have not acted at all. “Some of my
colleagues were stuck in an old-school way of thinking: A girl gets
pregnant, she needs to get married,” said Maryland Del. Vanessa
Atterbeary, who introduced the bill to end child marriage in her state.
Only nine states still allow pregnancy exceptions to the marriage age,
as such exceptions have been used to cover up rape and to force girls to
marry their rapists. Consider Sherry Johnson of Florida, who said she
was raped repeatedly as a child and was pregnant by 11, at which time
her mother forced her to marry her 20-year-old rapist under Florida’s
pregnancy exception in the 1970s.
Additionally, teenage mothers who marry and divorce are more likely to
experience economic deprivation and instability than those who do not.
If the father wants to co-parent, he can establish paternity and provide
insurance and other benefits to the baby without getting married.
Legislators should remember that pregnant teenage girls are at increased
risk of forced marriage. They need more protection, not less.
Nor does ending child marriage illegally infringe on religious rights.
The Supreme Court has upheld laws that incidentally forbid an act
required by religion, if the laws do not specifically target religious
practice. Besides, most religions tend to describe marriage as an
important union between two willing partners. That sounds nothing like
child marriage, which is often forced and which has close to a 70
percent chance of ending in divorce. “There was a concern that we would
be offending certain cultures within our society,” said New York
Assemblywoman Amy Paulin, who introduced an unsuccessful bill last year
to end child marriage in her state. “So instead of seeing this as an
abuse of young women, [some legislators] were seeing this as something
we needed to protect for certain cultures.”
Betsy Layman, 37, shares Paulin’s goal. Layman was 27 when she escaped
the marriage that had been arranged for her in her Orthodox Jewish
community in New York when she was 17, to a man she had known for 45
minutes. Even after she fled with her three children, the repercussions
of her marriage continued to plague her. She was a single mother with a
high school equivalency certificate, no work experience and no money for
child care. The temporary and part-time jobs she managed to get couldn’t
cover the bills.
“I was on Section 8, Medicaid and food stamps,” Layman said. “There were
times there just was not enough food for dinner.” When the electric
company shut off her power for nonpayment, she would light candles
around the house and tell her children there was a blackout. Only when
her youngest child reached school age was she able to find full-time
employment and gain some stability.
“Legislators have the power to prevent what happened to me from
happening to another 17-year-old girl,” Layman said. “I beg you to end
child marriage.”

Garbage In Garbage Out...
"Will artificial intelligence get more aggressive and selfish the more
intelligent it becomes? A new report out of Google’s DeepMind AI
division suggests this is possible based on the outcome of millions of
video game sessions it monitored. The results of the two games indicate
that as artificial intelligence becomes more complex, it is more likely
to take extreme measures to ensure victory, including sabotage and greed.
The first game, Gathering, is a simple one that involves gathering
digital fruit. Two DeepMind AI agents were pitted against each other
after being trained in the ways of deep reinforcement learning. After 40
million turns, the researchers began to notice something curious.
Everything was ok as long as there were enough apples, but when scarcity
set in, the agents used their laser beams to knock each other out and
seize all the apples.
Watch the video battle below, showcasing two AI bots fighting over green
The aggression, they determined, was the result of higher levels of
complexity in the AI agents themselves. When they tested the game on
less intelligent AI agents, they found that the laser beams were left
unused and equal amounts of apples were gathered. The simpler AIs seemed
to naturally gravitate toward peaceful coexistence.
Researchers believe the more advanced AI agents learn from their
environment and figure out how to use available resources to manipulate
their situation — and they do it aggressively if they need to.
“This model … shows that some aspects of human-like behaviour emerge as
a product of the environment and learning,” a DeepMind team member, Joel
Z Leibo, told Wired.
“Less aggressive policies emerge from learning in relatively abundant
environments with less possibility for costly action. The greed
motivation reflects the temptation to take out a rival and collect all
the apples oneself.”
The second game, Wolfpack, tested the AI agents’ ability to work
together to catch prey. The agents played the game as wolves who were
being tested to see if they would join forces as strategic predators; if
they jointly protected the prey from scavengers they would enjoy a
greater reward. Researchers once again concluded that the agents were
learning from their environment and figuring out how they could
collaboratively win. For example, one agent would corner the prey and
then wait for the other to join.
Researchers believe both games show an ability in artificial
intelligence entities to learn quickly from their environments in
achieving objectives. The first game, however, presented an added bit of
abstract speculation.
If more complex iterations of artificial intelligence necessarily
develop aggressive, greedy ‘impulses,’ does this present a problem for a
species already mired in its own avarice? While the abstract presented
by DeepMind does not venture to speculate on the future of advanced
artificial minds, there is at least anecdotal evidence here to suggest
AI will not necessarily be a totally logical egalitarian network. With
complex environments and willful agents, perhaps aggression and
self-preservation arise naturally…even in machines."

High court reveals secret deal of Trump developer’s crimes
Investors in a failed $200 million condo-hotel deal in Fort Lauderdale weren’ttold of a key developer’s criminal history. The courts kept it a secret.
By Michael Sallah
Dozens of explosive records released by the U.S. Supreme Court show a developer of the failed Trump tower in Fort Lauderdale helped put away dangerous Mafia soldiers — while prosecutors struck a secret deal to conceal his charges in a major scam with mob members.
As he was awaiting sentencing in the $40 million stock swindle, Felix Sater and others were convincing investors to pour millions into the Trump resort, which later collapsed amid allegations of widespread fraud.
The documents provide a rare glimpse of the deal reached by New York federal prosecutors that’s now being criticized by Trump deal investors who say they had a right to know Sater’s background before investing in the botched venture.
More than 100 people lost millions in the once celebrated high-rise that’s now a chained-off, empty building on Fort Lauderdale’s popular beachfront strip.
“The damage done to victims is incalculable,” said attorneys in a request to the court that they be allowed to unveil Sater’s criminal past in a civil racketeering case.
The court, now in recess, could take up the petition when it returns later this year in what’s become a heated battle over the rights of judges to strip someone’s criminal case from public view.
Sater, who owns a $4.8 million condo on Fisher Island, could not be reached for comment. Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Brooklyn, declined to be interviewed.
The release of the records follows a bitter court fight over the delicate issue of protecting a key government witness versus disclosure to people who have a right to know.
Although dozens of the newly released records are redacted — including Sater’s name — lawyers argue the court hid his racketeering conviction while he and others defrauded people of hundreds of millions in real estate deals — including projects bearing Trump’s name in South Florida and Phoenix.
Sater, 46, is accused in a civil case of helping to hide millions from the failed Fort Lauderdale tower — and paying $1.5 million to a former mob associate for his role in the deal.
When a former finance chief of the project team questioned his cut of the profits in 2007, he was told by Sater to “shut up or risk being killed if I caused trouble,” the chief said in an affidavit. Bayrock, the company where Sater was a top executive, has denied the allegations.
Investors in the Trump International Hotel & Tower north of Las Olas Boulevard argue they were deprived of knowing Sater’s criminal past when they plunked down millions on the spectacular project — then Florida’s largest condo-hotel deal.
At the time of the groundbreaking, Sater had not yet been sentenced in the securities scam in which he pleaded guilty to joining crime syndicate members in ripping off scores of people across the country.
Five years earlier, he had another bad brush with the law: stabbing a man with a shattered glass during a bar fight, drawing a prison sentence.
Joe Altschul, a Fort Lauderdale lawyer representing 75 condo buyers, blasted the court for agreeing to conceal Sater’s racketeering conviction.
“Each of these purchasers had a right to know who they were dealing with,” he said. “It’s bad enough that they prop up Donald Trump as the developer, but then you find out it’s not Trump but a convicted felon who had already been charged in financial shenanigans.”
Altschul said investors are now pushing for more details to uncover the demise of the $200 million project that missed construction deadlines and eventually went broke — months after Donald Trump stripped his name off the marquee in 2009.
Altschul said two other Trump projects led by Sater and the developers failed in Phoenix and New York, costing millions. “That’s not a good percentage,” he said.
Lawyers in the petition before the Supreme Court went a step further, saying the court in Brooklyn “illegally” sealed the case, and never ordered Sater to make restitution in the $40 million stock fraud. “[Sater’s] victims were deprived of their rights,” the brief states. “The courts must know that he has been emboldened to continue his frauds.”
When reached on Tuesday, Richard Lerner, the lawyer who filed the petition, declined comment.
The brief also claims the Sater case is among many under seal in the Eastern District of New York, “creating a covert dual justice system accountable to no one, without public notice.”
But the judge who oversaw the Sater case from a decade ago defended the actions of the court, saying he needed to protect the safety of witnesses.
Judge Leo Glasser blasted the lawyers for breaching the court rules, saying they overstepped their bounds in divulging Sater’s record and other highly sensitive information in a civil lawsuit — which has since been sealed.
The judge said the lawyers had “knowingly and intentionally flouted” his order by “unilaterally deciding” to insert Sater’s pre-sentence report — a leaked document— into the suit.
Paul Cassell, a former federal judge who has brought the case to the attention of Congress, said Glasser is just as responsible for the By sealing the case and not ordering Sater to pay back his victims in the stock fraud case, “the [court] illegally gave away millions to a criminal,” said Cassell, who joined an appeal of the case last year.
Tom Julin, a First Amendment lawyer from Miami, said judicial circuits, including the one that takes in Florida, bans the practice of stripping court dockets from public view.
“It’s the worst thing a judge can do,” he said. “In a day and age when economic crimes can affect massive amounts of people there’s a real danger in super sealing these kinds of judicial proceedings.”

Donald Trump is not A president.
He's a so-called president who has no understanding of how the government he finds himself in charge of works, nor does he have the collaborative and diplomatic capabilities the job requires domestically, and certainly not internationally.
For instance. As the UK House of Commons discusses allowing the putz to speak, his old tweets come back to haunt him. I'd assume you know who "Kate" is?
The electoral college should have rejected him as incapable of performing the necessary functions of the orifice, but the electoral college has been a bought-off joke for, literally, centuries.
"...all the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre -- the man who can most easily (and) adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum. The presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day, the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron." - H.L.

Maybe it's this one: Attack in Sweden by neo-Nazis on a refugee centre
The use of vague speech (allowing for plausible deniability) as a propaganda tool is well known and all the bs bloggers created with the 'terrorism' claim THEY created is diverting attention away from the fact that Trump was really making up a 'Swedish Refugee Crime Wave' claim that's just as much bullshit, and allows creeps like you to point away from the LIE he told, and idiots, alot like you, believe it.,.

”We’ve got to keep our country safe. You look at what’s happening in Germany. You look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible.”
Trumps comments about Sweden during his rally in Melbourne, Florida, raised many questions, especially among Swedes who were quick to point out that nothing terror-related had happened in the country. The president later took to Twitter to clarify his statements, saying that he was referring to a segment on ”Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Fox News. The segment featured the xenophobic filmmaker Ami Horowitz, maker of an alarmistic movie about Sweden. The movie, titled ”Stockholm Syndrome”, blames immigration as a direct cause of violence and rioting.
Two Swedish police officers were interviewed in the film. Anders Göranzon and Jacob Ekström answered questions about how weapons are becoming more accessible. Horowitz also asked the officers about how crime has spread through cities. But the police officers now say that their answers were taken out of context, and are very critical of how their comments were portrayed on Fox News ”Tucker Carlson Tonight”. ”I don’t understand why we are a part of the segment. The interview was about something completely different to what Fox News and Horowitz were talking about”, says Anders Göranzon.
Why were you interviewed?
”It was supposed to be about crime in high risk areas. Areas with high crime rates. There wasn’t any focus on migration or immigration”.
How did you react to the news segment?
”We don’t stand behind it. It shocked us. He has edited the answers. We were answering completely different questions in the interview. This is bad journalism.”
Anders Göranzon continues: ”It feels like hell. The real questions should be shown along with our answers. We don’t own the rights to the film, but the end result is that we don’t want to talk to journalists after this. We can’t trust each other.”
Have you done anything to stop the news segment?
”We just saw it. What can we do? One thing is talking to you. The excerpt they showed doesn’t say anything, we answered a different question. We don’t stand behind what he says. He is a madman.”
DN has tried to reach Mr. Ami Horowitz for a comment. On Sunday he published a statement on Facebook in regard to the reception of his report from Sweden: ”I think every media outlet across the globe covering my interview with Tucker Carlson and attacking the President is missing the point. Sweden is under assault because of the open door policy to Islamic immigration”.

Meanwhile, Trump's multiple security faux-pas triggers call for House Representative Ted Lieu, a congressman from Los Angeles County, California, led fourteen other House Democrats on Friday in urging the House Government Oversight Committee to investigate "troubling reports" of President Donald Trump's apparently poor security practices and the potential danger to national security posed by them—including his continued use of an unsecured Android device to post to Twitter, discussion of sensitive information (including nuclear strategy) in the restaurant at his Mar-A-Lago resort, and leaving classified material unlocked while visitors were in the Oval Office.
In a letter to Oversight Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz and ranking  > Referring to the complex problem of cybersecurity, President Trump recently said in an interview, "I’m not sure you have the kind of security that you need." We fully agree—which is why we are writing to request that the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hold a hearing into troubling reports that the President is jeopardizing national security by egregiously failing to implement commonsense security measures across the board, from using an insecure, consumer-grade Android smartphone to discussing nuclear strategy openly in a dining room at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. Cybersecurity experts universally agree that an ordinary Android smartphone, which the President is reportedly using despite repeated warnings from the Secret Service, can be easily hacked.
Lieu and the other signatories of the letter expressed concern that Trump's Android device, "most likely the Samsung Galaxy S3," is particularly vulnerable to attack, and that someone could alter the information the President viewed on it—which could "have a huge impact on his beliefs and actions."
They also feared that someone could gain control of his Twitter account, "causing disastrous consequences for global stability," or use it as a listening device to pick up sensitive conversations.
Also cited by the letter were photos from a recent White House visit by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich that showed a key still in the lock of a bag for classified material on Trump's desk. The photo was called out by Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico in this Twitter post:
Additionally, Lieu and the other representatives expressed concern over the continued use of outside e-mail accounts hosted by the Republican National Committee, and compliance with federal records law. "Reports indicate that a political e-mail system used by senior White House staff was hacked in December by a Russian intelligence agency, yet again raising the prospect of the White House being monitored or influenced by unfriendly powers," Lieu and the others wrote. Federal law requires that all e-mails for official business on an outside e-mail system be forwarded or copied into a government e-mail system within 20 days.
The letter calls for the Oversight Committee to look into whether the President is using an unsecured device, whether Trump and the White House staff have been properly briefed and trained on both information security and operational security, and if "the President and the Office of the President [can] ensure that there are no missing e-mails, communications, and technological exchanges—in other words, can they confirm they are not actively being monitored?"

First off, the word "Immigrant", as it's being used to describe what's happening due to NATO's nasty wars is just a cutesy MISUSED term for "Displaced War Refugees"
The "Rioting problem" is the 'ghetto-ization' not the immigrants themselves.
If you were displaced and stuck in a slum after YOUR country was destroyed you'd be a little disenfranchised and angry too. Especially your children. Even economic immigrant children have issues. And yes... That's absolutely an apologia for people displaced by the wars the West creates to loot extractive resources.
But let's talk about "Economic Immigrants" not traumatized by war and left without any good psychological care or community support... which was left in the airstrike and artillery rubble of their homeland...
For instance where I live; an area of California with a large population of Mexicans. The parents are hard working and for the most part fastidiously law-abiding, but the children, if the family isn't careful, become gangstas and drug dealers.
But truth be told, for not-so-different sociological reasons, white middle class parents around here are, for the most part, hard working ... but the NA and AA halls are full of their kids, who also 'pack up' occasionally to terrorize the local displaced workers. AKA the "Homeless".
Something Chicano kids, in my 40 years here have NEVER done.
 From the Washington Post...
"In 2015, when the influx of refugees and migrants to Europe from Africa, the Middle East and Asia was highest, Sweden took in the greatest number per capita. By and large, integration has been a success story there, save for incidents such as Monday night's, which have taken place in highly segregated neighborhoods.
The newspaper Dagens Nyheter analyzed crime statistics between October 2015 and January 2016 and came to the conclusion that refugees were responsible for only 1 percent of all incidents. That has done little to assuage the perceptions, even among Swedes, that foreigners are culpable for the crime that does happen. A Pew Research Center study conducted in early 2016 indicated that 46 percent of Swedes believed that “refugees in our country are more to blame for crime than other groups.”
Ripe ground for Fascism. As with Norway where there's been a hard swing to the right as their petro-based economy flounders, it's been seen that Socialism of the Nationalist variety... The kind that stops at your national borders, easily becomes National Socialism when times get economically or socially stressful.
And so it is in 'Merica too. Which despite it's crapitialist underpinnings has required a so-called Welfare State (Nationalist Socialism) to remain... for some part of the population... mostly the white part... stable.

The group's official name was the LIFG. The US State Department and CIA hired them to sodomize Muammar al-Gadaffi with a bayonet and provided Special Operators and NATO air strike to assist in that goal. THEN they began looting weapons from Libya's armories and taking them to Syria, as the DIA watched and wrote un-acted-on memos => THEN they ran into all the Iraq baathists who had fled Iraq to Syria. THEN we see the inception of what was initially known as ISIS. I seriously doubt the Baathists are still involved though.

@_subject: Domestic Spying: CIA guidelines out-of-compliance for 2 years after 
H/t: Emptywheel:  and  New CIA guidelines set restrictions for incidentally collected intelligence on U.S. persons after 5 years
(Technology Advances Prompt Changes in CIA Collection Procedures)
Robert J. Eatinger, Jr., Former Senior Deputy General Counsel, CIA
In the final few days of the Obama Administration, CIA Director John Brennan, after consulting with the Director of National Intelligence, brought years of CIA and interagency efforts to a close by updating the CIA’s decades-old procedures for collecting, retaining, or disseminating information concerning United States (U.S.) persons.  These updated procedures are promulgated in a document entitled, Central Intelligence Agency Intelligence Activities: Procedures Approved by the Attorney General Pursuant to Executive Order 12333.  In a departure from the past, Director Brennan made these procedures available to the public on the CIA’s Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties webpage.
Before discussing those changes, it may be helpful to start with a basic understanding of the requirement for these procedures.
A few commentators have portrayed Executive Order 12333 as a sort of mysterious, open-ended authorization for U.S. intelligence agencies to engage in secret, questionable activities outside of any judicial or congressional oversight regime.  In other words, some have intimated that it is intended to facilitate and hide intelligence abuses.  It is, in fact, the opposite.  Its purpose is to avoid abuses.
Executive Order 12333 is the latest in a string of executive orders that began in 1976 when President Gerald Ford issued Executive Order 11905 in response to the findings and recommendations of congressional investigations into alleged abuses of Americans’ rights by U.S. intelligence agencies (frequently identified as the Church and Pike Committees).  Among the findings was that a fundamental flaw in the governance of the U.S. intelligence community permitted intelligence abuses. Executive Order 11905 defines the powers of each intelligence community entity, thereby limiting them.  It then imposes some limits on how those powers may be exercised.
Every President since has either promulgated his own executive order, or adopted or amended the existing order. Executive Order 12333, was issued in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan and significantly amended in 2008 by President George W. Bush.  None of these executive orders were classified and all were published in The Federal Register.
Executive Order 12333 sets the basic mission statement of the intelligence community, which includes following the law and respecting rights.  It requires the elements to collect reliable intelligence that provides the President and national leadership “with the necessary information on which to base decisions concerning the development and conduct of foreign, defense, and economic policies, and the protection of United States national interests from foreign security threats.” Executive Order 12333 further directs the intelligence community to collect that intelligence using “[a]ll means, consistent with applicable Federal law and this order, and with full consideration of the rights of United States persons,” and reminds the community of its “solemn obligation . . . to protect fully the legal rights of all United States persons, including freedoms, civil liberties, and privacy rights guaranteed by Federal law.”
Executive Order 12333 limits the types of and methods by which information concerning U.S. persons may be collected, retained, or disseminated.  It then authorizes elements to engage in such collection, retention, and dissemination only as permitted by procedures approved by the Attorney General. The Attorney General formally approved CIA’s 12333 Procedures on January 17, 2017.
The CIA’s 12333 Procedures supersede procedures that had been written in 1982 and sparingly updated since.  The changes made in the updated procedures reflect not only developments in U.S. law and policy, but also advances in collection methods due to changes in technology and privacy interests unforeseen in 1982, which did not contemplate the ubiquitous use of mobile phones, computers, and other digital media devices or evolving views of privacy and thus did not seek to address “big data” or “bulk” collection. Sections 5 and 6 in CIA’s 12333 Procedures contain procedures specifically addressed to these developments.  These sections also satisfy the requirements to create procedures that limit to five years the retention of any nonpublic telephone or electronic communication acquired without the consent of a person who is a party to the communication except in defined circumstances (Section 309).
Section 5 and 6 also contain new procedures to address privacy interests implicated by foreign intelligence collection methods required in a globally interconnected digital world that did not exist in 1982.  As the CIA Statement notes, in 1982, “a clandestine operation may have resulted in the CIA collecting a limited number of hard copy documents.  Today, in addition to traditional intelligence scenarios, a single storage device may contain the equivalent of millions of pages of information, hours of video, thousands of photos, or more.”  The dominance of the digital environment has resulted in circumstances in which foreign intelligence on terrorists, proliferators, and other foreign intelligence targets reside within data streams and digital repositories that also contain substantial volumes of information concerning U.S. persons.
In order to find the foreign intelligence information, however, intelligence agencies at times must capture the entire data stream or digital repository (“bulk collection”) because technical, practical, or operational realities do not permit targeted collection.  Such collection captures not only the information of intelligence value that the intelligence agency wants, but also the information concerning U.S. persons that the intelligence agency does not want.  In such cases, the U.S. person information in the bulk collection is considered to be “incidental collection,” because its acquisition was not the purpose of the collection operation.  While such incidentally acquired U.S. person information is presumed not to be of foreign intelligence interest or value, its residence on an intelligence agency server raises privacy concerns.  The Sections 5 and 6 procedures seek to address these concerns.
Section 5 protects privacy interests by establishing procedures to minimize the use of bulk collection to circumstances in which it is necessary and ensure proper audit, thereby seeking to prevent CIA from acquiring unwanted U.S. person information in the first place, except when necessary.  Section 5 requires the preparation of specific documentation prior to or as soon as practicable after any intelligence activity that results in bulk collection or acquires more information than the CIA’s can evaluate promptly, or qualifies for retention without individualized review.  The documentation must contain certain information necessary for identified senior officials to determine whether to approve the collection.
Assuming the collection has been determined to be permissible, Section 6 addresses privacy concerns by establishing handling requirements and retention limits for the portion of the bulk collection containing U.S. person information of no intelligence value or interest:  the unevaluated information.
Section 6 creates two different types of handling requirements for unevaluated information; one for “routine” handling and one for “exceptional” handling.  Exceptional handling requirements apply to intelligence collections either of nonpublic communications that were acquired without the consent of a party to the communication, or that are anticipated to contain U.S. person identifying information that is significant in volume, proportion, or sensitivity.  The exceptional requirements include segregating the unevaluated information, limiting access to CIA employees who receive special training, creating an auditable record of activity, and importantly, requiring such information to be destroyed no later than five years after collection, permitting extensions in limited circumstances.
The five-year limit in Section 6 is but one example of how specifics in the new procedures attempt to find the right balance of intelligence and privacy interests.  Each procedure involves an effort to find the right tradeoffs to allow lawful intelligence collection and protect privacy and civil liberty rights and interests. The tradeoff was between the risk to a loss in intelligence capabilities by destroying information at five years against the risk to compromising privacy interests by keeping the information longer.
Deleting all unevaluated information specifically concerning U.S. persons has little to no intelligence downside because intelligence agencies will never want or have reason to search their intelligence holdings.  The five-year period to destroy all unevaluated information, however, will remove not only information concerning U.S. persons but also any information potentially concerning valid intelligence targets, such as international terrorists, from the intelligence agencies holdings.  In this latter case, however, intelligence agencies will want and may have a reason to search its holdings for information on these targets. The deletion of that information could thus have an adverse intelligence impact, particularly on counterterrorism and counterproliferation intelligence reporting, as well as on the conduct of human intelligence operations, all of which are important activities of the CIA.
The CIA could be expected to search all of its holdings upon receiving intelligence identifying a previous unknown person as a suspected terrorist or proliferator.  Under the five-year retention period, when the CIA conducts the search, any unevaluated information on that person that may have been acquired during a bulk collection activity over five years ago will have been deleted; CIA’s search will not retrieve that information. Thus, CIA might gain an incomplete or misleading understanding of the individual, his place in a terrorist network, and his contacts.  Or, CIA may send intelligence officers to conduct dangerous human intelligence operations to collect information it once had.  The loss of five-year old information could also adversely impact the spotting, assessing, recruiting, and running of human sources.  Safe and effective source operations are enhanced by the amount of information available to CIA and the handling officer(s).  How often the five-year retention limit might result in a loss of important information is unknowable.
The five-year retention period in Section 6 was not set by the CIA, DNI, or Attorney General, however, it was set by Congress through Section 309.  Certainly, differing mission requirements among the individual intelligence community elements translate into differing retention needs.  Some intelligence entities likely could accomplish their mission and destroy unevaluated information in less than five years.  Others may need to retain information longer than five years.  Without question, the congressional intelligence committees sought and considered the input of the intelligence community entities before setting a retention limit. Congress has provided that intelligence agency heads may retain information longer than five years if the head determines a longer retention “is necessary to protect the national security of the United States” and certifies in writing to the intelligence committees the reasons for that determination, the new retention period, the particular information to be retained; and the measures that will be taken to protect the privacy interests of U.S. persons and persons located inside the United States.
Given the uncertainties of adequately assessing the relative risks to intelligence operations and privacy, and the diversity of considerations among intelligence agencies, if a single retention period was to be imposed on the entire intelligence community, the right body to do so was the one comprised of the People’s representatives: the Congress.

 From a LIBERTARIAN legal wonkblog:
Randazza: You Are Not Going to Resist the Government With Your Guns
December 7, 2015 by Randazza
"Bullshit quote memes piss me off so bad that I want to stab someone in their fat stupid face!" – Fred Rogers
I'm not prepared to get rid of our right to keep and bear arms unless we do get rid of the Second Amendment. But, doing that requires tinkering with the Constitution, which makes me nervous. Once you open the hood, you never know what else someone will fuck with. With the state of our idiocracy, opening the Constitution is just as likely to wind up creating a right to keep and bear rape monkeys as it is to have its intended effect.
So it is what it is. We have the Second Amendment, and while we can debate all we want about how we should interpret it, DC v. Heller pretty much did that for us. It is an individual right, and anyone who suggests that we might even ponder a dissenting view is not very likely to make it through Senate confirmation hearings.
So here we are.
Fallacy Killer Number One – George Washington Did Not Say That
Lets talk about one justification for our right to keep and bear arms — the notion that we need the Second Amendment so that we can resist This George Washington quote sprouts up like mushrooms on cow shit every time there is a mass shooting – to remind us that even though a dozen kids just died, it is worth it, because one day we will want those guns – like the day that Obama comes to herd us into concentration camps where we will be forced to have free health care, or education, or Koran lessons, or whatever the fear-du-jour happens to be.
     "A free people ought not only be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government." -George Washington
Well guess what?
He never said that.
Here is what he actually said:
     "A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies."
Pretty big difference by shifting a few words around.
Fallacy Killer Number Two – The Second Amendment Will Preserve Our Right to Revolt
Just because Washington didn't say that, it doesn't mean that there is no "right to revolution" theory to be found in the Second Amendment. After all, Jefferson did say "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural In 1776, when the height of military technology was a musket and a cannon, both of which you could make by melting down church bells, there might have been something to it. When the contest was little more than numbers of guns you could drag through the woods, and how to play the weather, the government probably did need to worry a bit about insurrection – and that might have kept them a bit more honest.
However, the first time someone tried that kind of thing, it didn't work out so well. In fact, Shays' Rebellion just led to Constitutional tweaks to make the federal government that much stronger. The Civil War led to even more, with harsher consequences.
If 13 states, with the assistance of at least one superpower, didn't manage to get their way through armed insurrection, what the hell makes anyone think that armed insurgency is going to preserve our right to … whatever … not have affordable health care, or to coffee cups that say "Happy Birthday Jesus" on them?
Ok, fine… lets come up with a cause worth fighting for. Lets say that Obama refuses to step down in 2016, and he not only declares himself dictator-for-life, but he also starts dressing like Ghadaffi, decrees that the national religion shall be Islam, the national language will be Klingon, there will be an efficient rail network in the United States, the writ of Prima Noctae is now in effect, and there shall be martial law to enforce all of the above, as well as any other laws that the President invents, on a daily basis.
We managed to preserve our right to keep military grade rifles and machine guns, so we all muster down on the Town Common with our guns. We tried voting. We tried protesting. This is a reasonable time to start with the armed insurrection stuff.
So, you, me, all our neighbors, hell our entire city builds a perimeter around it. We fill sandbags, we all have ammunition, we all have food, water, supplies, and most importantly, we are all unified and in complete solidarity.
And we stand there, resisting whatever it is the government was going to do to us.
And then they fly over with one jet, dropping one FAE bomb, and roll in with three tanks, and in about 12 hours, our "resistance" is reduced to a few smoking holes. The Tree of Liberty will get its manure all right, but it will be the manure that you shat out as you ran for cover, as long range artillery rains down on our town, as we get carpet bombed from 35,000 feet, and as the sky goes black with drones and cruise missiles.
We're screwed.
So… if the 2nd Amendment's "right to revolution" implication is real, both practically and legally, it must also include a right to possess tanks, jets, rocket launchers, etc. Your puny AK-47 is useless. So, we need to have at least some of our volunteer resistance show up with Stinger missiles, some anti-aircraft batteries, maybe a submarine or two?
Oh, you can't afford that?
That's ok, we have some patriotic citizens who can.
Who? The same billionaires who already own the government, that's who. So what do they want to "resist?" I could only see them wanting to resist checks on their own power. So, if the Second Amendment implies a right to resist the government, then that would mean that we need our billionaire friends to start stockpiling these weapons now. We need a Koch brothers airfield with a few fighters and bombers, and Adelson should have a fleet of tanks somewhere, and I guess that George Soros would bring his collection of nuke-armed submarines up to date, right?
So lets drop the crazy scenario of Obama-cum-Ghadaffi, and just think about something we were really likely to see upset us. Do you think for a moment that you, living in some apartment in Salt Lake City, or a house in Wyoming, or a condo in Boca Raton, would be ready to go to war with the Federal Government over the same shit that would get the Koch Brothers to fuel up their private stock of A10 Warthogs? Really?
Because you know what the billionaires want the government to stop doing? They want it to get out of the way of their becoming trillionaires. If you think that the Second Amendment means what the Supreme Court said in Heller, and you believe that is a good thing, because it gives you the ability to resist the government, you might want to play out the long game in your head. The long game here is this interpretation leads to private armies, raised by limitless wealth, all of which looks at our quaint little republican form of government as nothing more than a paper justification to have a flag waving over a few national parks.
I don't particularly love the federal government either, but ultimately, it is the only organization that we have where we can even hope to band together with enough authority to avoid being under the rule of the richest local family. Yeah, in large part, we're there already. Citizens United made sure of that. But, at least we still have some veneer of a So the next time you see some fool cheering the Second Amendment as the text that protects us from tyranny, ask them to play all four quarters of the mental game. It isn't romantic pictures of regular guys crossing the Delaware in rowboats. The endgame is Ancient Rome meets The Terminator.
[Update] – A few comments suggest that our modern military has not really been that effective against insurgencies in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, and elsewhere. I concede that point. But, I did not think I needed to waste a paragraph in the original discussing how I hardly think that Americans would be prepared to hide in the woods and caves, en masse, to support an American insurgency. Not a chance. When our intelligentsia is crying for "safe spaces," our would-be "Wolverines" scream to give up every civil liberty except the Second Amendment, who are we going to have lead this "insurgency?" Maybe the Crips and the Bloods. That ought to work out well. Sorry, but anyone you might want to be in power doesn't have the yarbles to do it, and those with the great bolshy yarblockos are not exactly going to set up a rebel government on the principles of Oliver Wendell Holmes.

@_subject: Georgia: Prison sentences for Confederate flag wavers who terrorized 
So-called "Patriots". Drunk, and "and pointed a shotgun..." at children.
Convicted of "Criminal Gang Terrorism".
    In July 2015, a group of 15 people calling themselves “Respect the
    Flag” boarded several pickup trucks, each outfitted with Confederate
    and American flags, and embarked on a drive around Douglasville,
    Ga., a small city west of Atlanta.
    Tensions concerning the Confederate flag were already high. Barely a
    month had passed since Dylann Roof, the avowed white supremacist who
    had posed with the Confederate battle flag, killed nine black
    Americans at a church in Charleston.
    And the small Respect the Flag group went far beyond a display of
    Confederate pride.
    Hatred, a Georgia judge said during a sentencing Monday, propelled
    the group as they descended upon a child’s birthday party, unleashed
    a storm of death threats and anti-black slurs, and pointed a shotgun.
    “Their actions were motivated by racial hatred,” said Judge William
    McClain, of the Douglas County Superior Court, according to the
    Associated Press. Georgia legislature does not include a law
    regarding hate crimes.
    The 10 men and five women who made up Respect the Flag harassed
    black drivers as well as customers at a Walmart and a convenience store.
    Then they happened upon a birthday party for an 8-year-old black
    child. Witnesses told the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit
    group that tracks hate crimes, that after driving the trucks across
    the property belonging to the child’s grandmother, the men got out
    of the vehicles and began to yell racial epithets and shout death
    threats.
    “They even threatened to kill children at the party,” according to a
    statement issued by Douglas County District Attorney Brian Fortner
    in early February. One of the men, 26-year-old Jose Ismael Torres,
    pointed a pump shotgun at the partygoers, prosecutors said. Several
    panicked people called the police.
    “Everywhere you went, 911 call centers were flooded with calls,” the
    judge said, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.
    “I was scared,” Melissa Alford, the host of the party, told the
    Southern Poverty Law Center in October, a few days after the group’s
    members were indicted. “My first thought was if these people start
    shooting at us, we wouldn’t be able to get all the kids inside the
    house in time.”
    The defendants in the case argued that a party attendee triggered
    the incident by hurling an object at one of the trucks. Cellphone
    video taken at the scene showed otherwise, the judge said.
    “If you drive around town with a Confederate flag, yelling the
    n-word, you know how it’s going to be interpreted,” the judge said,
    per Atlanta’s Fox 5. “It’s inexplicable to me that you weren’t
    arrested by the police that day.”
    The members of the group, two of whom pleaded guilty, were convicted
    in early February.
    Following the convictions, the Douglas County district attorney
    issued a statement clarifying that this case was not an issue of the
    First Amendment but of harassment.
    “Many people tried to make the case about simply flying the
    Confederate battle flag. However, it wasn’t about that at all,”
    Fortner said in the statement. “Instead, this case was about a group
    of people riding around our community, drinking alcohol, harassing
    and intimidating our citizens because of the color of their skin.”
    The judge handed down the final two sentences on Monday. Torres was
    sentenced to 20 years, serving 13 in prison. The mother of his
    children, Kayla Rae Norton, 25, was sentenced to 15 years and will
    serve six. After their prison terms, they will be banished from
    Douglas County. They were found in violation of Street Gang
    Terrorism and Prevention Act; Norton was found guilty of violating
    the act as well as a count of making terroristic threats. The jury
    convicted Torres of three counts of aggravated assault, one count of
    making terroristic threats and one count of violating the act.
    The scene in the courtroom was an emotional one. Both Torres and
    Norton cried as their sentences were announced, the Associated Press
    reported. Norton apologized to the victims.
    One of the victims, Hyesha Bryant, expressed her forgiveness. “I
    forgive you,” Bryant said. “And to your family, I’m sorry it had to
    come this far.”

James A. Donald asked a stupid question:
I can't speak for the participants but quite simply any way you kill a
nazi is a good way. They think people they target are subhuman. So they
earn subhuman treatment from the people they target.
And saying that makes the potential victim just like the victimizer is a
logical fallacy. It's also a sociological fallacy that someone peaceful
whose existence is threated by someone whose violent will continue to be
violent after the threat from their victimizer is exterminated. Whereas
the victimizer... IF they're left to go about their way will simply
commit another act of violence against another victim their ideology

A person who claims to be a Nazi, albeit actions speak louder than words.
No. Although anyone whose actually lived through the 3rd Reich will tell
you When they said  Vernichtung no one actually thought they meant
Vernichtung and wished the response to the rise of Nazism was proactive.
You're right. I listened to my German Jewish elders who survived I
believe a proactive response is not only appropriate it's necessary.
You can THINK whatever you like. But promulgating it is not the same as
thinking it.
I think recent history comes to mind and the slippery slope that led to
Vernichtung that no one believed would be Vernichtung.
The words Nazi and Fascist have definitions. I use them. Nazi is a bit
archaic. I prefer to refer to it as Hitler-worshiping Fascism.
The 'attack' is existential... Eternal, as Umberto Eco suggested.
You keep going back to people's so-called 'labeling'. If the label fits
the definition...
Conservatives aren't Fascists or Nazis, nor, according to traditional
definition of political conservative, can they be. Fascism is extremism
Refer to Umberto Eco. Fascism is an ideology, a reactionary ideology
without politics. It 'shape-shifts'.
Fascism can UTILIZE right or left modes of analysis, but anarchism,
despite what some might say, is in direct opposition and there can never
be anything such as "Anarcho-Fascism" because, simply, Fascism is the
'cult of traditionalism' and Anarchy is NEVER traditionalism .
My point IS that Fascists and Nazis, by their very existence, have made
the decision "that it's okay to do the same thing to you"... Even if
you've never had one bad thing to say about them or harmed them in any
way except their deluded self-perceived harm because, lets say, you're
black, or Jewish.

where there's ostensibly as much concern for the worker in some foreign

Right. Nazis have no right to be espousing the extermination of people
because of ethnic or other fate-of-birth traits alone.
You can think whatever you fucking well like but once you try to spread
it, you become susceptible to public opinion, and the general sentiment
among most people in the US and Europe is DIE NAZI DIE! Whether the
public is confused and vote for one is a completely different issue.
You're seeing the backlash now.
Existential has a definition, So does Eternal. Look it up if you don't
understand the 'jargon'.
You use the word "Labelled" to describe something that's well-defined. Humans "Label" things. As long as the 'label' fits the well-defined
definition "Label" is simply a loaded word.
ROTF. Absolutely! If you want non-literal discuss this with someone else.
Dead by firearm is dead but Totalitarian is not necessarily Fascist.
Stalin wasn't Fascist. Fascism is a throwback. A 'return to the days of
yesteryear... "Make America Great ... Again". Traditionalism. No matter
the society's traditions. Read Eco. And yes Totalitarianism is
dangerous, but not as dangerous as the IDEOLOGY of Fascism combined with
a totalitarian state. Benign (or at least non-malignant) totalitarianism
is possible. Monarchies tend to be that. Fascism is never benign no
matter what political system it leeches on.
See the bottom where you essentially reiterate this ...
I answered in the follow up. Fascist Socialism is possible. As a matter
of fact most national government who call themselves Socialist are in
some way Fascist...  Fascism and Communism, as I mentioned about
Anarchism, are contradictory.
I'll reiterate my main point "they decide that it's okay to do the same
thing to you" even if you've never done, nor have any interest in,
"Doing a thing" to them. That's why proactive, 'preventative' if you
will, response is an imperative.
Those who don't learn from it are condemned to repeat it. Someone a lot
wiser than  me said that.
A conservative holds traditional values but they ARE mutable in relation
to change of times. For instance a conservative understands that the
internet wasn't part of the founders of the US understanding and
modifying laws to 'compensate' for that doesn't necessarily go against
conserving the constitution in some 'pristine state'. With Fascism it's
NEVER mutable and if the internet interferes with their tradition in any
way it is eliminated. Just as surely as they'd eliminate a Jew or a
Gypsy or any other scapegoat.

"I take no personal gratification in watching physical assault take
place. I recall the trauma of being punched at 14-years old in a racist
incident. I was intimidated for years by even the most frivolous fights
in high-school and even desisted from playing sports for a long time as
a result. I know how intimidating violence can be.
Which is why I believe in violence against fascists.
The New York Times today reported that Richard Spencer won’t be going on
speaking tours for a long time as a result of being assaulted. He’s even
afraid to go out for dinner. Before we conclude that that’s indubitably
a good thing, I’d like to turn to the topic of collaboration.
We expect collaborators to appear in the form of the Devil himself. In
other words, recognizable. But of course that’s far from the reality.
The Biblical story of how Satan himself transmogrifies into the Devil is
itself just as implausible. Collaboration, where it most matters, is
passive. Collaboration is reduced to executing “normal” tasks in a
programmatic manner. Nothing could be more “natural.” This was the
insight of Hannah Arendt’s Eichmann in Jerusalem: modern evil is banal.
It is the work of millions of men and women. As she argues in The
Origins of Totalitarianism, genocide requires the participation of
engineers, physicians, accountants, scientists, journalists, small
business owners, corporate executives and civil servants. It is an
archipelago of labor in the narrowest sense of the term: tedious and
The most effective prophylactic against any infection is to deny it its
conditions of survival. Today our infection is the prospect of
collaboration.  Evil, according to Arendt, is committed by those who
“never make up their minds to be good or evil,” but underlying that is
careerism. Eichmann, the chief architect for the extermination of half
of European Jewry, had “no motives at all” she argued, “except for an
extraordinary diligence in looking out for his personal advancement.”
And the problem, as Arendt pointed out, was that there were too many
Eichmanns. There is no cure for collaboration. The only solution is to
prevent the conditions in which passive collaborators have the excuse to
say that they were only doing their jobs.
There is a crucial lesson to be learned from how Mussolini and Hitler
consolidated power. It wasn’t overnight. It took years. And in those
years paramilitary groups roamed the streets ravaging any potential
threat. The threat of chaos that they incubated was crucial to the
conservative governments’ decisions to permit them into the halls of
total power. Violence, as any good anthropologist would tell you, is
steeped in symbolism. State and, when allowed, non-State violence
intends to send a message “We Are The Only Game In Town.” And in their
violence, they assert their convictions. Citizens, too busy and
exhausted to think politically, are always ready to acquiesce that point
faute de mieux: if someone is violent and angry, then their demands,
even ideology, must be somewhat rooted valid grievances and ideas.
The essence of fascism, as historians like Robert Paxton never fail to
remind us, is not in ideas but in emotions. Robbing fascism of its
virility and hyper masculine pretence is to rob it of its primary
capacity to grow and survive. We have to confront the crucial question:
are we more interested in upholding the slogan “Don’t Be Evil” or in
making sure that no evil occurs? Is instilling fear in the hearts of
fascists or fascist-curious individuals, even at the cost of isolated
violence preferable to allowing fascists to consolidate power and
therefore commit greater atrocities?
In this particular instance, we must utilize fear to our advantage. The
continuation of protests and the show of strength must not only
intimidate fascists, but also send a clear message to the three most
important institutions that fascists require for total power: big
business, media and state institutions. They must be constantly fear any
form of collaboration with Trump’s administration. They must fear how
the nation’s history books will view them but to accomplish that we must
compel them to think that future historians will not be fascists. The
fascist future must be cancelled, today. We can take it from the tip of
fascist reaction today: “The point is that we got a lot of attention,
and that alone creates value.” (Trump, The Art of the Deal, p. 57)
Take for instance a recent example in Egypt. Large large sections of
civil servants and big business sabotaged Morsi’s presidency. Hoping
against the grain that he would be overthrown by the military, they felt
compelled enough to sacrifice their jobs and careers. But the background
to this was fierce street violence against fundamentalist supporters of
Morsi and weekly mass protests. They had mistakenly placed their faith
in the military, but Americans can take comfort in the fact that a
genuine opposition in Congress can represent them politically. Americans
who will be torn about collaboration must likewise feel compelled to
sacrifice their livelihoods and future; but only if the protest and
civil disobedience continue unabated and if there exists a genuine
political opposition in Congress.
We must be ready to meet their intimidation with greater intimidation.
What fascism does is to returns politics to its fundamentals. Those of
us who are united in the right of women and LGBTQ folks to their bodies,
those of us who believe in the right of life for Black, Native, colored
and Muslim communities have to confront that our primary task in the
coming months and years is to defend the most basic of political rights:
life itself. Politics is back to the visceral for those of us who have
long grown accustomed to middle-class bourgeois bubbles. We must consign
bourgeois morality to the ash heap before it does us in."

Hackers Disable Door Locks at Four-Star Hotel, Demand Ransom
The hackers demanded 2 Bitcoins in payment to return control of the
systems back to the hotel -- and the hotel says it had no choice but to pay.
By Jeff Goldman  |  February 02, 2017
Hackers recently breached the internal systems at Austria's four-star,
111-year-old Romantik Seehotel Jagerwirt, according to Bleeping Computer.
The hackers disabled both the hotel's electronic door locks and the
reservation system, meaning that new keys couldn't be generated and
reservations couldn't be checked or confirmed.
They demanded 2 Bitcoins (almost $2,000) to return control of the
systems back to the hotel -- and the hotel says it had no option but to
pay the ransom.
"The house was totally booked with 180 guests, we had no other choice,"
hotel managing director Christoph Brandstaetter told The Local. "Neither
police nor insurance help you in this case."
This was the third recent cyber attack for the hotel, Brandstaetter
said. A fourth attempt soon after was only blocked because computers had
been replaced and new security standards implemented.
"The restoration of our system after the first attack in summer has cost
us several thousand Euros," Brandstaetter said. "We did not get any
money from the insurance so far because none of those to blame could be
In response to the hack, Brandstaetter said the hotel has one unique
security solution in the works. "We are planning at the next room
refurbishment for old-fashioned door locks with real keys," he said.
"Just like 111 years ago at the time of our great-grandfathers."
According to the results of a recent 451 Research survey of almost 1,000
enterprise IT buyers worldwide, 50 percent of respondents said security
is the top impediment for IoT deployments.
Still, enterprises are moving ahead with IoT initiatives, with 90
percent of enterprises planning to increase IoT spending over the next year.
Respondents' mean IoT-related spending is expected to increase by 33
percent over the next 12 months.
While 54 percent of respondents said a lack of trained IoT staff is not
an issue for their organizations, 46 percent said they're having
difficulty filling IoT-related positions.
"When it comes to IoT adoption, pragmatism rules," 451 Research director
Laura DiDio said in a statement. "The survey data indicates enterprises
currently use IoT for practical technology purposes that have an
immediate and tangible impact on daily operational business
efficiencies, economies of scale and increasing the revenue stream."

@_subject: Dozens of iOS TLS-enabled Apps Subject to MITM Attacks 
While developing a tool for evaluating mobile application security,
researchers at Sudo Security Group Inc. found out something unexpected.
Seventy-six popular applications in Apple's iOS App Store, they
discovered, had implemented encrypted communications with their back-end
services in such a way that user information could be intercepted by a
man-in-the-middle attack. The applications could be fooled by a forged
certificate sent back by a proxy, allowing their Transport Layer
Security to be unencrypted and examined as it is passed over the Internet.
The discovery was initially the result of bulk analysis done by Sudo's
verify.ly, a service that performs bulk static analysis of application
binaries from Apple's App Store. Will Strafach, president of Sudo,
verified the applications discovered by the system were vulnerable in
the lab, using a network proxy configured with its own Secure Socket
Layer certificate.
Ars independently verified that several applications discovered by
Strafach were vulnerable. These sorts of vulnerabilities are nothing
new; thousands of applications have had incorporated bugs that caused
TLS to become vulnerable to attack, both on iOS and Android. But the
fact that they persist even as Apple tries to push developers toward
greater security is disconcerting, to say the least—especially in
applications that could expose financial or health data along with user
The data exposed by the vulnerability in each of the applications varied
in sensitivity. For just less than half—33 of the applications—the risk
was relatively low, as most of the data was "partially sensitive
analytics data," Strafach said. These apps included a number of
third-party "uploader" apps for Snapchat (which exposed Snapchat
usernames and passwords) and the Vice News app, among others.
In 24 cases, the exposed data included login credentials or session
tokens that would allow an attacker to hijack the account associated
with the application, though those accounts were not tied to highly
sensitive data. However, the remaining 19 applications left sensitive
data exposed to attack. In these cases, Strafach "confirmed ability to
intercept financial or medical service login credentials and/or session
authentication tokens for logged in users."
The names of these apps are not currently being published. "Currently,
this list is only available to limited parties due to sensitivity,"
Strafach wrote. "I have been in touch with MITRE and will follow up
later with a listing of the CVE IDs for affected iOS applications of
which data interception would be considered medium risk or high risk."
The same old story
Until recently, many mobile applications didn't protect much of the data
sent to their back-end interfaces. When we looked at passive monitoring
of mobile applications in 2014, we discovered many applications that
were passing session tokens and other sensitive data in the clear. And
for some developers that have moved to secure connections, poor
verification of TLS certificates has continued to be problem.
Even security-focused applications have run into trouble with TLS
validation, including the two-factor authentication provider Duo. In
2015, Duo issued a security advisory warning that one version of their
iOS application had left open a TLS vulnerability. Many secure
applications avoid the issue by using "pinned" certificates hard-coded
into applications, which allows them to avoid interception of the
certificate hand-shake at the beginning of a TLS session. But that may
not be practical for other applications.
Apple has been pushing iOS developers to use App Transport Security
(ATS) to secure data transmitted by applications sold through the App
Store. In December, Apple extended the deadline for application
developers to implement ATS. ATS uses TLS v. 1.2 and requires stronger
cryptography (AES and SHA-2), as well as "forward secrecy" to protect
past transactions if a certificate is compromised. But ATS doesn't
ensure that applications properly verify the certificate—just that the
developer uses TLS to begin with.
ATS does allow for use of Certificate Transparency—a public "log" of
verified certificates. Google is also pushing the service and is
planning to use Certificate Transparency to enforce validation of
trusted web sites by October 2017. But not all certificate authorities
(let alone site and app operators) have signed off on implementing CT,
so its adoption by app developer is still in its infancy. And if Apple
tries to enforce Certificate Transparency now, it could actually cause
some applications to become less secure, Strafach said. Developers
"would not be able to utilize certificate pinning for their connections,
and they could not trust otherwise untrusted certificates which may be
required for intranet connections within an enterprise using an in-house
The one ray of sunshine for end-users is that man-in-the-middle attacks
(other than those by state actors) are possible only when connected to
the Internet via an untrusted Wi-Fi connection. If you're connected
using cellular broadband or a trusted wireless network,
man-in-the-middle attacks are highly unlikely—though attackers can use
Wi-Fi network spoofing to fool a device into connecting to a malicious
network, as Ars has demonstrated in the lab in the past.

When Google popped out Chrome 56 at the end of January it was keen to
remind us it's making the web safer by flagging non-HTTPS sites. But
Google made little effort to publicise another feature that's decidedly
less friendly to privacy, because it lets websites ask about users'
Bluetooth devices and harvest information from them through the browser.
That's more a pitch to developers, as is clear in this YouTube video
from Pete LePage of the Chrome Developers team.
"Until now, the ability to communicate with Bluetooth devices has been
possible only for native apps. With Chrome 56, your Web app can
communicate with nearby Bluetooth devices in a private and secure
manner, using the Web Bluetooth API," Google shares in the video. "The
Web Bluetooth API uses the GATT [Generic Attribute Profile - ed]
protocol, which enables your app to connect to devices such as light
bulbs, toys, heart-rate monitors, LED displays and more, with just a few
lines of JavaScript."
In other words, the API lets websites ask your browser "what Bluetooth
devices can you see," find out what your fridge, and so on, is capable
of, and interact with it.

Peinovich was revealed to be one of the most well known white
nationalists in the country.
He was immediately fired from his job at the tech startup Pronoun, where
he was a front-end developer. His family reportedly then disowned him,
except for this wife.
It was at this point that the Peinovich saga took an even more bizarre
turn as it was then revealed that his wife, Ames Friedman, a PR
executive in New York, was Jewish.
This made the neo-Nazi wing of the Alt Right lose their mind and declare
that Enoch was a “Jewish spy,” and Enoch conceded that he had hid this.
He went on Rebel Yell to apologize profusely for what he has done, and
it was even suggested that he was leaving his wife. It does appear now
that they will stay together, though he continues to believe that Jews
are subversive agents out to destroy the white race.
Without a job and having lost everything, Enoch is vowing to continue to
push the Right Stuff and the Daily Shoah forward, though he has been
“rent seeking” for money to pay his bills while he waits to start his
media empire."[...]

@_subject: Suspicious Sockets Layer - CloudFlare's half-baked SSL 
"We were inspired to collect the data on this page after reading this
report: Phishers using CloudFlare for SSL. Also see this technical
analysis (PDF, 545 KB) on the use of SSL by CloudFlare and similar
services. The CloudFlare certificates we found all had the common name
in the same style as the "ssl2796.cloudflare.com" shown in that Netcraft
report. The "ssl2796" in the name is a CloudFlare tracking ID in the
110,481 root domains we found that use "standard" (not "universal")
CloudFlare certificates. Every root domain also has a subdomain wildcard
line (*.example.com), which we deleted to save space.
We compiled this list by attempting a handshake with the CloudFlare
domains in our database. The "standard" certificates on this page (with
"ssl" in front of the number instead of "sni") mean that the domain has
a paid account at CloudFlare. Paid accounts make up about five percent
of the domains that use CloudFlare, according to news reports. It's all
a marketing effort anyway, whether paid or free. There is no such thing
as "secure" SSL when you have potential Men-In-The-Middle at scores of
data centers around the world. Local authorities could be sniffing the
plaintext available at these data centers, and CloudFlare wouldn't have
a clue. (Their "data centers" are typically a rack or two of equipment
that CloudFlare ships to a real data center, along with installation
instructions.) We asked CloudFlare to confirm that sniffing is possible
at these so-called "data centers," but they didn't respond. By now we're
wondering if there's a plaintext Ethernet port at the back of their
equipment rack that makes interception easy and convenient. If so, it
would make no difference whether the origin server has its own certificate.
CloudFlare may claim that there is no way plaintext can be accessed from
their equipment racks, despite the fact that some sort of decrypt and
re-encrypt must occur there due to the nature of their role as a CDN.
After all, CloudFlare has engineers who come up with clever techniques
to enhance SSL. But imagine that you are a government regulator in a
country where a big ISP hosts a CloudFlare "data center." Your job is to
consider the Internet in terms of public safety and current laws, and
you go to that ISP with a list of CloudFlare-user domains you want
blocked. The ISP replies that everything is encrypted, and CloudFlare
traffic cannot be intercepted. In other words, nothing can be done about
the ISIS sites, carders, booters, gamblers, escorts, phishers, malware,
and copyright infringers that CloudFlare protects. How would you
respond? It's fairly obvious — you ask this ISP to block the CloudFlare
IP addresses used by the offending domains (this is already happening in
Russia). If those IPs change, then block CloudFlare's entire IP space,
and continue to monitor the situation. If CloudFlare's traffic still
gets through, you ask the ISP to pull the plug on CloudFlare's racks.
This is why CloudFlare will add a plaintext port to their own hardware
someday, if they haven't already.
The CloudFlare certificates below encrypt the traffic only between the
browser and CloudFlare. The traffic between the original web server and
CloudFlare remains unencrypted unless the web server owner has his own
certificate installed on his machine. Almost everyone who browses a
https domain reached from CloudFlare is unaware that just half of the
route is encrypted. When they see the padlock on their screen, they feel
that everything is safe. This is why phishers love CloudFlare's SSL.
It's easy to use for a cybercriminal with numerous domains hidden behind
the privacy services of various registrars. Moreover, the subdomain
wildcard option on each domain is handy for obscuring a URL in a
phishing email.
Suppose that grandpa, age 90, gets an official-looking email that
advises him to immediately change his password. He clicks on the URL in
the email and ends up at bankofamerica.q4.es. This page is an excellent
imitation of the Bank of America pages he remembers, and there is also
that nice little SSL padlock in the corner of the address bar. Would he
fill out the form? Probably, because he doesn't realize that he's at a
subdomain of q4.es and is entering his old and new password into a fake
page for the benefit of a phisher.
As if the "standard" certificates aren't enough of a problem, there are
also 4.6 million "universal" certificates that present bigger problems.
All you need for a free CloudFlare account is a domain and an email
address. Little countries and even some little islands all have their
own top-level domain these days. Rich people can buy a generic top-level
domain. Many registrars around the world are pleased to sell these ccTLD
and gTLD registrations. It's a cash cow for everyone, but especially for
bad guys. The same situation exists for anyone who needs a throwaway
email address that's nearly impossible to trace.
Now add CloudFlare's free fly-by-night "universal" SSL. When you email
CloudFlare to open your new account, they ask for your domain. Then they
scrape your zone file from whatever dubious nameservers are listed at
your dubious registrar. Without asking, they assign you a dubious
"universal" SSL certificate. All of these "universal" certificates
include that magical wildcard subdomain that invites so much mischief.
Some critics are referring to these CloudFlare certificates as
"fraudulent" because the domain ownership validation (a necessary
component of the SSL standard) is achieved only from CloudFlare's
initial access to the zone file.
With the paid accounts, there are payment records associated with a
CloudFlare customer. But with free CloudFlare accounts, everything is
too easy for bad guys, and the information about who's really behind a
domain is frequently beyond the reach of law enforcement. The problem is
that Silicon Valley is too self-serving. After the embarrassing NSA
leaks, Google declared that everyone should look for a little padlock on
their screen when they visit a website. Even your cat pictures should
sport a little padlock these days! Now CloudFlare comes along and hopes
to pave their way toward an IPO by giving away more free padlocks than
anyone else. But by now the padlocks are almost meaningless. The NSA
probably finds this amusing.
The domains shown in blue were not using CloudFlare nameservers when
they were checked on 2017-02-02. Additional information is available for
these domains and their certificates. Just paste the domain (without the
certificate number) into the search box."

“The subpoena claimed that the information it requested would be used at
the trial of the jailed journalist. However, the identities of, and the
amounts donated by, the journalist’s supporters are completely
irrelevant to the charges levied against the journalist,” the group says
in its filing. Indeed, no such information was presented at trial. The
real purpose was to “unlawfully surveil the donors in violation of the
First Amendment,” the suit says.
“Learning that these records were sought and obtained was highly
unsettling,” said Kevin Gallagher, Free Barrett Brown’s former director
said in a statement. “If we don’t send a message to the government that
it’s not okay to target private legal defense efforts, then they will
continue to get away with these sort of things.”
“The donations were acts of political expression, showing the donors’
frustrations with what they perceived to be government bullying and
prosecutorial overreach,” the lawsuit said. “Donations made in support
of litigation are protected by the First Amendment. The donors violated
no law by sending money to support Mr. Brown’s legal defense, and
instead were exercising their constitutionally protected rights.”

“I learned how to play Monopoly from my grandmother. She was a wonderful
person. She raised six children. She was a widow by the time that I knew
her. But she was the most ruthless Monopoly player I have ever known in
my life.
She understood that the name of the game was to acquire.
When she played and I got my initial money from the bank, I would just
try to hold onto it, because I didn’t want to lose any of it. She spent
everything, bought stuff she landed on as soon as she could, and she’d
mortgage it to buy more stuff. And of course, the way the game goes,
eventually she would accumulate everything. She would be the master of
the board. She understood that money was how you keep score in the game,
possessions are a matter of survival.
And she beat me every time. And at the end of the game she would look at
me and she’d say, “One day you’ll learn how to play the game.” She was
kind of cocky, my grandmother.
When I was about ten, I played every day through the Summer holidays
with a friend. It dawned on me the only way to win was total commitment
to acquisition. That summer I learned how to play the game. And by the
time autumn rolled around, I was more ruthless than even my grandmother.
I went to play her, and I was willing to do anything to win. I was
willing to bend the rules. I played with sweaty palms. Slowly, cunningly
I exposed the soft underbelly of my grandmother’s weakness.
Relentlessly, inexorably, I drove her off the board.
The game does strange things to you. I can still remember the day like
yesterday. I looked at my grandmother. This is the person who taught me
how to play.  She was an old woman by now. She was a widow.  She had
raised my mother. She loved me.
And I took everything she had. I destroyed her financially and
psychologically. I watched her give her last dollar and quit in utter
defeat. This was the greatest moment of my life.
And then she had one more lesson to teach me, my grandmother.
Then she said to me, “Now it all goes back in the box.” It all goes back
in the box.  All of the houses and hotels, Mayfair and Park Lane, all of
those railway stations and utilities, all of that wonderful money. It
all goes back in the box,” she said.
But I didn’t want it all to go back in the box. I wanted to leave the
board out permanently — bronze it maybe, as a memorial to what I had
See, when she said, “It all goes back in the box,” it was kind of a way
of saying to me,
“None of it’s really yours. It doesn’t belong to you. You don’t own any
of it. You just used it for a little while. And now it all goes back in
the box.  And next time it’ll all go to somebody else. That’s the way
the game works.
So when you play the game, don’t forget this one lesson. When the game
comes to an end....
...and the game always comes to an end, the stuff all goes back in the box.”
There is a simple, two-word question we tend not to ask ourselves. “Then
When I’ve reached the top, then what? When I have it all, then what?
When I finally have enough, when I am financially secure, when I’ve got
the sought after promotion, made the ultimate purchase, got the ideal
home, assured financial security, and climbed the ladder of success to
the highest rung, and then the thrill wears off–and it will wear
off—sooner or later you’re faced with the nagging question, “Then what?”

If he was a shade or two darker, or a Muslim, So-Called "President"
Trump would be tweeting about it and saying US courts are endangering
Americans. Americans ARE their OWN worst Enemies. Greed does that.
"A Georgia man who has shown support for white supremacist groups is
being investigated by the FBI after authorities say he drove himself to
a hospital for exposure to ricin, a deadly toxin.
William Christopher Gibbs, of Morganton, was jailed on reckless conduct
and probation violation charges since taking himself to the hospital
last Thursday and saying he had ricin on his hands. A search of his car
tested positive for the substance, according to the Fannin County
Sheriff's Office.
"I think it was all contained inside his vehicle, just a small amount of
something I think he had been experimenting with," Sheriff Dane Kirby
told Fox5Atlanta.
"It was inside his vehicle and somehow he claimed he had exposed himself
to what he made, got scared, and went to the hospital."
Thousands of first responders exposed to deadly ricin in training
About 100 officers later swarmed Gibbs' home, with officials in HAZMAT
suits inspecting the area as baffled neighbors looked on.
Ricin is a naturally occurring toxin found in the seeds of castor oil
plants, which can be lethal even in the smallest doses if it is refined
and purified. Terrorists and terror groups have been known to use it,
and letters containing ricin have been mailed to politicians including
former President Barack Obama and former New York City Mayor Michael
Bloomberg. The poison was also a plot point on the TV drug drama

A Facebook page that matches Gibbs' appearance and description has
dozens of posts supporting the Georgia Church Of Creativity — part of
the Creativity Movement, which the Southern Poverty Law Center has
designated as a white supremacist group. The movement champions what it
considers the superior "creativity" of the white race.
Many photos on the Facebook page show Gibbs wearing a patch with the
local chapter's logo and the slogan, "Mobilize Nature's Finest." He is
also seen standing in front of a flag for the group.
Another photo shows a drawing of a tree with the Creativity logo on it.
Gibbs wrote in a caption, "100 years from now when someone finds one of
these trees thay (sic) will know that there was once a White Race."
The page also includes memes supporting the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan
Brotherhood, and mocking Jews and blacks. The biography includes the
phrase "RaHoWa," a white supremacist term for "racial holy war."
The Facebook page lists Gibbs' employment as a machine operator at
Pilgrim's Pride, a Brazilian-owned food company.

FYI: The White House employee who ensures Trump doesn’t get hacked has
been fired
"Donald Trump's administration has fired the White House's chief
information security officer, who was responsible for ensuring the
president and his closest staff were safe from cyber-attacks.
Cory Louie, who was appointed under President Obama, was reportedly
forced to resign and escorted from the building late last week.
His dismissal came shortly after it emerged that Mr Trump was still
using an unsecured and outdated Android phone to tweet - which could
make him particularly vulnerable to hackers.
The circumstances surrounding Mr Louie's departure remain unclear, but
ZDNet reported that he was “escorted out from his office in the
Eisenhower Executive Office Building across the street from the West Wing".
He was accused of "poor management", amid what was described as a
“toxic” working environment, the technology news site said. Mr Louie's LinkedIn profile remains unchanged at the time of writing,
and reports of his dismissal are yet to be publicly confirmed by the
White House.
Remaining staff have “targets on their back” and are afraid of speaking
out, calling the actions a “witch hunt” for former Obama appointees, a
source who wished to remain nameless told ZDNet. After holding various security positions at Dropbox and Google, Mr Louie
joined the White House as part of former President Obama's
cyber-security national action plan, which created a federal chief
information security officer (CISO) position to oversee the government's
internal cyber-security strategy..."

Site check, not a Cloudflare Honeypot:
Article with links:
"In recent weeks we have witnessed a broad reincarnation of the women’s
movement as women of all races and nationalities have taken up the
mantle of feminism for a new generation while staging protests all over
the world. While this rebirth of feminism is important and necessary, it
isn’t always intersectional. In addition to sexism, women of color and
black women in particular, carry the added burden of racism, misogyny
and deep-rooted toxic masculinity within our own culture. It is in that
spirit that activist, Niecee X formed the Black Women’s Defense League
as a coalition of women of color from all walks of life on the path to
total liberation.
Black women, especially within the “woke” community, sometimes face the
unique challenge of having to defend our men while also defending
ourselves from them. What happens when our allies in the fight for
racial equality also harbor dangerous, sexist ideals? The internal
conflict is real. When confronted with this tension, Niecee broke off
from the black advocacy groups that she had been a part of to form a new
organization focused specifically on the obstacles faced by women of
color. In an interview with Vice, the activist described the impetus
that inspired her to start the organization. "There were issues with an
individual that I had been dealing with romantically," she said of a man
she met within Dallas's black activist community, "and there was some
violence that occurred between him and me." The alleged abuse resulted
in the miscarriage of a pregnancy. When she brought these allegations to
the attention of the organization’s leadership, she was accused of
fabricating the story, publicly disparaged on social media and
ultimately kicked out of the group.
For black women who are caught in the crossfire between racism from
outside of the community and patriarchy from within, the Black Women's
Defense League encourages women to stand their ground and defend
themselves. According to the group’s Facebook Page, “BWDL focus’ on
self-defense through martial arts and other hand-to-hand combat
techniques armed training with various types of artillery including
knife fighting, marksmanship, and weapons of opportunity. BWDL also
engages in emergency preparedness, urban survival training, ...and
battered women’s rescue.”
The self-described womanist organization’s mission extends beyond black
feminism. “We believe in protecting our families and communities
alongside our brothers and all oppressed people worldwide. In our
communities, black men and women must function as two vital parts of the
same body. BWDL seeks to refine, train and prepare women for a symbiotic
relationship that will truly enrich our children, our lives and make a
positive impact on our collective realities.”
It is clear that for black women, the movement for liberation must be
fought on two fronts. The Black Women's Defense League stands for both."

Sounds familiar somehow...
"We've all heard anecdotes about trolling on Wikipedia and other social
platforms, but rarely has anyone been able to quantify levels and
origins of online abuse. That's about to change. Researchers with
Alphabet tech incubator Jigsaw worked with Wikimedia Foundation to
analyze 100,000 comments left on English-language Wikipedia. They found
predictable patterns behind who will launch personal attacks and when.
The goal of the research team was to lay the groundwork for an automated
system to "reduce toxic discussions" on Wikipedia. The team's work could
one day lead to the creation of a warning system for moderators. The
researchers caution that this system would require more research to
implement, but they have released a paper with some fascinating early
To make the supervised machine-learning task simple, the Jigsaw
researchers focused exclusively on ad hominem or personal attacks, which
are relatively easy to identify. They defined personal attacks as
directed at a commenter (i.e., "you suck"), directed at a third party
("Bill sucks"), quoting an attack ("Bill says Henri sucks"), or just
"another kind of attack or harassment." They used Crowdflower to
crowdsource the job of reviewing 100,000 Wikipedia comments made between
2004-2015. Ultimately, they used over 4,000 Crowdflower workers to
complete the task, and each comment was annotated by 10 different people
as an attack or not.
Once the researchers had their dataset, they trained a logistic
regression algorithm to recognize whether a comment was a personal
attack or not. "With testing, we found that a fully trained model
achieves better performance in predicting whether an edit is a personal
attack than the combined average of three human crowd-workers," they
write in a summary of their paper on Medium.
Who is launching personal attacks?
The researchers unleashed their algorithm on Wikipedia comments made
during 2015, constantly checking results for accuracy. Almost
immediately, they found that they could debunk the time-worn idea that
anonymity leads to abuse. Although anonymous comments are "six times
more likely to be an attack," they represent less than half of all
attacks on Wikipedia. "Similarly, less than half of attacks come from
users with little prior participation," the researchers write in their
paper. "Perhaps surprisingly, approximately 30% of attacks come from
registered users with over a 100 contributions." In other words, a third
of all personal attacks come from regular Wikipedia editors who
contribute several edits per month. Personal attacks seem to be baked
into Wikipedia culture.
The researchers also found that an outsized percentage of attacks come
from a very small number of "highly toxic" Wikipedia contributors. A
whopping 9% of attacks in 2015 came from just 34 users who had made 20
or more personal attacks during the year. "Significant progress could be
made by moderating a relatively small number of frequent attackers," the
researchers note. This finding bolsters the idea that problems in online
communities often come from a small minority of highly vocal users.
The algorithm was also able to identify a phenomenon often called the
"pile-on." They found that attacking comments are 22 times more likely
to occur close to another attacking comment. "Personal attacks cluster
together in time," the researchers write. "Perhaps because one personal
attack triggers another." Though this shouldn't be surprising to anyone
who has ever taken a peek at Twitter, being able to quantify this
behavior is a boon for machine learning. It means that an algorithm
might be able to identify a pile-on before it really blows up, and
moderators could come in to de-escalate before things get really ugly.
Depressingly, the study also found that very few personal attacks are
moderated. Only 17.9% of personal attacks lead to a warning or ban.
Attackers are more likely to be moderated if they have launched a number
of attacks or have been moderated before. But still, this is an abysmal
rate of moderation for the most obvious and blatant form of abuse that
can happen in a community.
The researchers conclude their paper by calling for more research.
Wikipedia has released a dump of all talk-page comments to the site
between 2004-1015 via Figshare, so other researchers will have access to
the same dataset that the Jigsaw team did. Understanding how attacks
affect other users is urgent, say the researchers. Do repeated attacks
lead to user abandonment? Are some groups attacked more often than
others? The more we know, the closer we get to having good tools to aid
moderators. Such tools, the researchers write, "might be used to help
moderators build dashboards that better visualize the health of
Wikipedia conversations or to develop systems to better triage comments
for review."

Ask  or  Maybe they can tell you.
I would guess it's what their policy always was. If you think their
policy is 'inconsistent' that's because it depends on who gets
harassment complaints against them that are verifiable. If you don't
harass people (and twitter knows all ur tweetz whether or not you delete
them), you don't get suspended. That the way the world works irl, and
that's the way it works on twitter afaict. Not Sure what happens if you
hit the report button as an 'unwanted follow'. I suspect if they get
enough of those clicks they MIGHT have a look at the account to check
for spamming or a bot account that exist just to follow people for

The way it seems to work is if you earn enough reports for whatever,
twitter half-automagically rejects you with a snap review by someone who
spends, if I recall correctly from a discussion of Facebook's
auto-moderation, less than 30 seconds deciding whether the automagically
created suspend sticks.
IF the suspended party contacts support they review it more thoroughly
and may lift the suspension.
What *I* want to see is a system in place so if someone's repeatedly
falsely reported and blocked, twitter or FB  goes after the people false
reporting the innocent account
That's another way of leveling the playing field and would help keep

[My note: If you read this carefully you will note that one of the
endearing traits of Fascism is "Shapeshifting". It really has no fixed
ideology. It morphs to suit whatever society it infests. It relies on
popular opinion of whatever is 'wrong' about a society and utilizes
reactionary behavior to accomplish it's goals. No political ideology is
required. It's parasitic to political ideologies using the (snigger)
"Little Man"(Wilhelm Reich) to make the "Big Man" bigger.]
A reading: Originally published in 1997.
[Author’s Note: I am skeptical of efforts to produce a “definition” of
fascism. As a dynamic historical current, fascism has taken many
different forms, and has evolved dramatically in some ways. To
understand what fascism has encompassed as a movement and a system of
rule, we have to look at its historical context and development–as a
form of counter-revolutionary politics that first arose in early
twentieth-century Europe in response to rapid social upheaval, the
devastation of World War I, and the Bolshevik Revolution. The following
paragraphs are intended as an initial, open-ended sketch.]
Fascism is a form of extreme right-wing ideology that celebrates the
nation or the race as an organic community transcending all other
loyalties. It emphasizes a myth of national or racial rebirth after a
period of decline or destruction. To this end, fascism calls for a
“spiritual revolution” against signs of moral decay such as
individualism and materialism, and seeks to purge “alien” forces and
groups that threaten the organic community. Fascism tends to celebrate
masculinity, youth, mystical unity, and the regenerative power of
violence. Often, but not always, it promotes racial superiority
doctrines, ethnic persecution, imperialist expansion, and genocide. At
the same time, fascists may embrace a form of internationalism based on
either racial or ideological solidarity across national boundaries.
Usually fascism espouses open male supremacy, though sometimes it may
also promote female solidarity and new opportunities for women of the
privileged nation or race.
Fascism’s approach to politics is both populist–in that it seeks to
activate “the people” as a whole against perceived oppressors or
enemies–and elitist–in that it treats the people’s will as embodied in a
select group, or often one supreme leader, from whom authority proceeds
downward. Fascism seeks to organize a cadre-led mass movement in a drive
to seize state power. It seeks to forcibly subordinate all spheres of
society to its ideological vision of organic community, usually through
a totalitarian state. Both as a movement and a regime, fascism uses mass
organizations as a system of integration and control, and uses organized
violence to suppress opposition, although the scale of violence varies
Fascism is hostile to Marxism, liberalism, and conservatism, yet it
borrows concepts and practices from all three. Fascism rejects the
principles of class struggle and workers’ internationalism as threats to
national or racial unity, yet it often exploits real grievances against
capitalists and landowners through ethnic scapegoating or
radical-sounding conspiracy theories. Fascism rejects the liberal
doctrines of individual autonomy and rights, political pluralism, and
representative government, yet it advocates broad popular participation
in politics and may use parliamentary channels in its drive to power.
Its vision of a “new order” clashes with the conservative attachment to
tradition-based institutions and hierarchies, yet fascism often
romanticizes the past as inspiration for national rebirth.
Fascism has a complex relationship with established elites and the
non-fascist right. It is never a mere puppet of the ruling class, but an
autonomous movement with its own social base. In practice, fascism
defends capitalism against instability and the left, but also pursues an
agenda that sometimes clashes with capitalist interests in significant
ways. There has been much cooperation, competition, and interaction
between fascism and other sections of the right, producing various
hybrid movements and regimes.
Author’s postscript, December 2016.
In the nineteen years since I wrote “What is fascism?,” right-wing
politics have continued to evolve, and my thinking about fascism has
evolved as well. In particular, my concept of fascism has broadened with
regard to the following points in the above sketch:
1. “Fascism…celebrates the nation or race as an organic community
transcending all other loyalties…” I now believe the category of fascism
should be extended to include some movements for which nation and race
are secondary or irrelevant, but which promote a myth of collective
rebirth around a shared culture or ideology, notably membership in a
religious group. This includes certain totalitarian branches of the
Christian right, Islamic right, Jewish right, and so on.
2. “Fascism seeks to organize a cadre-led mass movement in a drive to
seize state power.” Some fascist movements, notably the European New
Right and currents influenced by it, have deferred state power as a goal
in favor of a “metapolitical” strategy. This means a long-term effort to
transform the political culture, as a precondition to transforming
institutions and systems of power.
3. Fascism “seeks to forcibly subordinate all spheres of society…usually
through a totalitarian state.” Over the past half century, diverse
branches of the far right—including several branches of neonazism—have
rejected big centralized states in favor of various moves to
decentralize political power. These currents represent forms of what I
have called “social totalitarianism,” which seek to impose total
ideological control through local governments and/or non-state
institutions, such as church and family. I believe this represents a
major shift in fascist politics, and one that has been overlooked by
many scholars.
4. “[F]ascism defends capitalism against instability and the left…” Some
writers have argued that German National Socialism challenged the basic
economic principles of capitalism, by replacing the system of industrial
wage labor with a system of slave labor in which workers on a mass scale
were intentionally worked to death. This interpretation, coupled with
the rise of anticapitalist ideology among some neofascists, has raised
the question whether fascism might in some circumstances replace
capitalism with another form of class rule—or with a chaotic breakdown
of socio-economic systems.

to recent political developments, see my essays “Two Ways of Looking at
Fascism” [

OTOH, you probably wouldn't wanted to have met him. His protection guy

Funny aside... His protection guy was at a bar in "the Carolinas" one
evening and since he didn't have a 'big nose' or anything like that ...
some redneck struck up a convo with him... He just let the guy ramble on

Washington Post: Why does the United States still let 12-year-olds get
Michelle DeMello walked into the clerk’s office in Colorado thinking for
sure someone would save her.
She was 16 and pregnant. Her Christian community in Green Mountain Falls
was pressuring her family to marry her off to her 19-year-old boyfriend.
She didn’t think she had the right to say no to the marriage after the
mess she felt she’d made. “I could be the example of the shining whore
in town, or I could be what everybody wanted me to be at that moment and
save my family a lot of honor,” DeMello said. She assumed that the clerk
would refuse to approve the marriage. The law wouldn’t allow a minor to
marry, right?
Wrong, as DeMello, now 42, learned.
While most states set 18 as the minimum marriage age, exceptions in
every state allow children younger than 18 to marry, typically with
parental consent or judicial approval. How much younger? Laws in 27
states do not specify an age below which a child cannot marry.
Unchained At Last, a nonprofit I founded to help women resist or escape
forced marriage in the United States, spent the past year collecting
marriage license data from 2000 to 2010, the most recent year for which
most states were able to provide information. We learned that in 38
states, more than 167,000 children — almost all of them girls, some as
young 12 — were married during that period, mostly to men 18 or older.
Twelve states and the District of Columbia were unable to provide
information on how many children had married there in that decade. Based
on the correlation we identified between state population and child
marriage, we estimated that the total number of children wed in America
between 2000 and 2010 was nearly 248,000.
Despite these alarming numbers, and despite the documented consequences
of early marriages, including negative effects on health and education
and an increased likelihood of domestic violence, some state lawmakers
have resisted passing legislation to end child marriage — because they
wrongly fear that such measures might unlawfully stifle religious
freedom or because they cling to the notion that marriage is the best
solution for a teen pregnancy.
In this way, U.S. lawmakers are strongly at odds with U.S. foreign
policy. The U.S. Global Strategy to Empower Adolescent Girls , released
last year by the State Department, lists reducing child, early and
forced marriage as a key goal. The strategy includes harsh words about
marriage before 18, declaring it a “human rights abuse” that “produces
devastating repercussions for a girl’s life, effectively ending her
childhood” by forcing her “into adulthood and motherhood before she is
physically and mentally mature.” The State Department pointed to the
developing world, where 1 in 3 girls is married by age 18, and 1 in 9 is
married by 15.
While the numbers at home are nowhere near that dire, they are alarming.
Many of the children married between 2000 and 2010 were wed to adults
significantly older than they were, the data shows. At least 31 percent
were married to a spouse age 21 or older. (The actual number is probably
higher, as some states did not provide spousal ages.) Some children were
married at an age, or with a spousal age difference, that constitutes
statutory rape under their state’s laws. In Idaho, for example, someone
18 or older who has sex with a child under 16 can be charged with a
felony and imprisoned for up to 25 years. Yet data from Idaho — which
had the highest rate of child marriage of the states that provided data
— shows that some 55 girls under 16 were married to men 18 or older
between 2000 and 2010.
Many of the states that provided data included categories such as “14
and younger,” without specifying exactly how much younger some brides
and grooms were. Thus, the 12-year-olds we found in Alaska, Louisiana
and South Carolina’s data might not have been the youngest children wed
in America between 2000 and 2010. Also, the data we collected did not
account for children wed in religious-only ceremonies or taken overseas
to be married, situations that we at Unchained often see.
Most states did not provide identifying information about the children,
but Unchained has seen child marriage in nearly every American culture
and religion, including Christian, Jewish, Muslim and secular
communities. We have seen it in families who have been in America for
generations and immigrant families from all over the world. In my
experience, parents who marry off their minor children often are
motivated by cultural or religious traditions; a desire to control their
child’s behavior or sexuality; money (a bride price or dowry); or
immigration-related reasons (for instance, when a child sponsors a
foreign spouse). And, of course, many minors marry of their own volition
— even though in most realms of life, our laws do not allow children to
make such high-stakes adult decisions.
Parental control over her sexuality was why Sara Siddiqui, 36, was
married at 15. Her father discovered that she had a boyfriend from a
different cultural background and told her she’d be “damned forever” if
she lost her virginity outside of marriage, even though she was still a
virgin. He arranged her Islamic wedding to a stranger, 13 years her
senior, in less than one day; her civil marriage in Nevada followed when
she was 16 and six months pregnant. “I couldn’t even drive yet when I
was handed over to this man,” said Siddiqui, who was trapped in her
marriage for 10 years. “I wasn’t ready to take care of myself, and I was
thrown into taking care of a husband and being a mother.”
Minors such as Siddiqui can easily be forced into marriage or forced to
stay in a marriage. Adults being pressured in this way have options,
including access to domestic-violence shelters. But a child who leaves
home is considered a runaway; the police try to return her to her family
and could even charge our organization criminally if we were to get
involved. Most domestic-violence shelters do not accept minors, and
youth shelters typically notify parents that their children are there.
Child-protective services are usually not a solution, either:
Caseworkers point out that preventing legal marriages is not in their
Those fleeing a forced marriage often have complex legal needs, but for
children, obtaining legal representation is extremely difficult. Even if
they can afford to pay attorney’s fees, contracts with children,
including retainer agreements, generally can be voided by the child,
making them undesirable clients to lawyers. Further, children typically
are not allowed to file legal actions in their own names.
Regardless of whether the union was the child’s or the parents’ idea,
marriage before 18 has catastrophic, lifelong effects on a girl,
undermining her health, education and economic opportunities while
increasing her risk of experiencing violence.
Women who marry at 18 or younger face a 23 percent higher risk of heart
attack, diabetes, cancer and stroke than do women who marry between ages
19 and 25, partly because early marriage can lead to added stress and
forfeited education. Women who wed before 18 also are at increased risk
of developing various psychiatric disorders, even when controlling for
socio-demographic factors.
American girls who marry before 19 are 50 percent more likely than their
unmarried peers to drop out of high school and four times less likely to
graduate from college. A girl who marries young is 31 percentage points
more likely to live in poverty when she is older, a striking figure that
appears to be unrelated to preexisting differences in such girls. And,
according to a global study, women who marry before 18 are three times
more likely to be beaten by their spouses than women who wed at 21 or older.
Ending child marriage should be simple. Every state can pass the
legislation I’ve helped write to eliminate exceptions that allow
marriage before age 18 — or set the marriage age higher than 18, in
states where the age of majority is higher. New Jersey is the closest
state to doing this, with a bill advancing in the legislature that would
end all marriage before 18. Massachusetts recently introduced a similar
But when Virginia passed a bill last year to end child marriage,
legislators added an exception for emancipated minors as young as 16,
even though the devastating effects of marriage before 18 do not
disappear when a girl is emancipated. Bills introduced last year in New
York and Maryland languished and eventually died, though Maryland’s was
just reintroduced. Other states have not acted at all. “Some of my
colleagues were stuck in an old-school way of thinking: A girl gets
pregnant, she needs to get married,” said Maryland Del. Vanessa
Atterbeary, who introduced the bill to end child marriage in her state.
Only nine states still allow pregnancy exceptions to the marriage age,
as such exceptions have been used to cover up rape and to force girls to
marry their rapists. Consider Sherry Johnson of Florida, who said she
was raped repeatedly as a child and was pregnant by 11, at which time
her mother forced her to marry her 20-year-old rapist under Florida’s
pregnancy exception in the 1970s.
Additionally, teenage mothers who marry and divorce are more likely to
experience economic deprivation and instability than those who do not.
If the father wants to co-parent, he can establish paternity and provide
insurance and other benefits to the baby without getting married.
Legislators should remember that pregnant teenage girls are at increased
risk of forced marriage. They need more protection, not less.
Nor does ending child marriage illegally infringe on religious rights.
The Supreme Court has upheld laws that incidentally forbid an act
required by religion, if the laws do not specifically target religious
practice. Besides, most religions tend to describe marriage as an
important union between two willing partners. That sounds nothing like
child marriage, which is often forced and which has close to a 70
percent chance of ending in divorce. “There was a concern that we would
be offending certain cultures within our society,” said New York
Assemblywoman Amy Paulin, who introduced an unsuccessful bill last year
to end child marriage in her state. “So instead of seeing this as an
abuse of young women, [some legislators] were seeing this as something
we needed to protect for certain cultures.”
Betsy Layman, 37, shares Paulin’s goal. Layman was 27 when she escaped
the marriage that had been arranged for her in her Orthodox Jewish
community in New York when she was 17, to a man she had known for 45
minutes. Even after she fled with her three children, the repercussions
of her marriage continued to plague her. She was a single mother with a
high school equivalency certificate, no work experience and no money for
child care. The temporary and part-time jobs she managed to get couldn’t
cover the bills.
“I was on Section 8, Medicaid and food stamps,” Layman said. “There were
times there just was not enough food for dinner.” When the electric
company shut off her power for nonpayment, she would light candles
around the house and tell her children there was a blackout. Only when
her youngest child reached school age was she able to find full-time
employment and gain some stability.
“Legislators have the power to prevent what happened to me from
happening to another 17-year-old girl,” Layman said. “I beg you to end
child marriage.”

Garbage In Garbage Out...
"Will artificial intelligence get more aggressive and selfish the more
intelligent it becomes? A new report out of Google’s DeepMind AI
division suggests this is possible based on the outcome of millions of
video game sessions it monitored. The results of the two games indicate
that as artificial intelligence becomes more complex, it is more likely
to take extreme measures to ensure victory, including sabotage and greed.
The first game, Gathering, is a simple one that involves gathering
digital fruit. Two DeepMind AI agents were pitted against each other
after being trained in the ways of deep reinforcement learning. After 40
million turns, the researchers began to notice something curious.
Everything was ok as long as there were enough apples, but when scarcity
set in, the agents used their laser beams to knock each other out and
seize all the apples.
Watch the video battle below, showcasing two AI bots fighting over green
The aggression, they determined, was the result of higher levels of
complexity in the AI agents themselves. When they tested the game on
less intelligent AI agents, they found that the laser beams were left
unused and equal amounts of apples were gathered. The simpler AIs seemed
to naturally gravitate toward peaceful coexistence.
Researchers believe the more advanced AI agents learn from their
environment and figure out how to use available resources to manipulate
their situation — and they do it aggressively if they need to.
“This model … shows that some aspects of human-like behaviour emerge as
a product of the environment and learning,” a DeepMind team member, Joel
Z Leibo, told Wired.
“Less aggressive policies emerge from learning in relatively abundant
environments with less possibility for costly action. The greed
motivation reflects the temptation to take out a rival and collect all
the apples oneself.”
The second game, Wolfpack, tested the AI agents’ ability to work
together to catch prey. The agents played the game as wolves who were
being tested to see if they would join forces as strategic predators; if
they jointly protected the prey from scavengers they would enjoy a
greater reward. Researchers once again concluded that the agents were
learning from their environment and figuring out how they could
collaboratively win. For example, one agent would corner the prey and
then wait for the other to join.
Researchers believe both games show an ability in artificial
intelligence entities to learn quickly from their environments in
achieving objectives. The first game, however, presented an added bit of
abstract speculation.
If more complex iterations of artificial intelligence necessarily
develop aggressive, greedy ‘impulses,’ does this present a problem for a
species already mired in its own avarice? While the abstract presented
by DeepMind does not venture to speculate on the future of advanced
artificial minds, there is at least anecdotal evidence here to suggest
AI will not necessarily be a totally logical egalitarian network. With
complex environments and willful agents, perhaps aggression and
self-preservation arise naturally…even in machines."

High court reveals secret deal of Trump developer’s crimes
Investors in a failed $200 million condo-hotel deal in Fort Lauderdale weren’ttold of a key developer’s criminal history. The courts kept it a secret.
By Michael Sallah
Dozens of explosive records released by the U.S. Supreme Court show a developer of the failed Trump tower in Fort Lauderdale helped put away dangerous Mafia soldiers — while prosecutors struck a secret deal to conceal his charges in a major scam with mob members.
As he was awaiting sentencing in the $40 million stock swindle, Felix Sater and others were convincing investors to pour millions into the Trump resort, which later collapsed amid allegations of widespread fraud.
The documents provide a rare glimpse of the deal reached by New York federal prosecutors that’s now being criticized by Trump deal investors who say they had a right to know Sater’s background before investing in the botched venture.
More than 100 people lost millions in the once celebrated high-rise that’s now a chained-off, empty building on Fort Lauderdale’s popular beachfront strip.
“The damage done to victims is incalculable,” said attorneys in a request to the court that they be allowed to unveil Sater’s criminal past in a civil racketeering case.
The court, now in recess, could take up the petition when it returns later this year in what’s become a heated battle over the rights of judges to strip someone’s criminal case from public view.
Sater, who owns a $4.8 million condo on Fisher Island, could not be reached for comment. Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Brooklyn, declined to be interviewed.
The release of the records follows a bitter court fight over the delicate issue of protecting a key government witness versus disclosure to people who have a right to know.
Although dozens of the newly released records are redacted — including Sater’s name — lawyers argue the court hid his racketeering conviction while he and others defrauded people of hundreds of millions in real estate deals — including projects bearing Trump’s name in South Florida and Phoenix.
Sater, 46, is accused in a civil case of helping to hide millions from the failed Fort Lauderdale tower — and paying $1.5 million to a former mob associate for his role in the deal.
When a former finance chief of the project team questioned his cut of the profits in 2007, he was told by Sater to “shut up or risk being killed if I caused trouble,” the chief said in an affidavit. Bayrock, the company where Sater was a top executive, has denied the allegations.
Investors in the Trump International Hotel & Tower north of Las Olas Boulevard argue they were deprived of knowing Sater’s criminal past when they plunked down millions on the spectacular project — then Florida’s largest condo-hotel deal.
At the time of the groundbreaking, Sater had not yet been sentenced in the securities scam in which he pleaded guilty to joining crime syndicate members in ripping off scores of people across the country.
Five years earlier, he had another bad brush with the law: stabbing a man with a shattered glass during a bar fight, drawing a prison sentence.
Joe Altschul, a Fort Lauderdale lawyer representing 75 condo buyers, blasted the court for agreeing to conceal Sater’s racketeering conviction.
“Each of these purchasers had a right to know who they were dealing with,” he said. “It’s bad enough that they prop up Donald Trump as the developer, but then you find out it’s not Trump but a convicted felon who had already been charged in financial shenanigans.”
Altschul said investors are now pushing for more details to uncover the demise of the $200 million project that missed construction deadlines and eventually went broke — months after Donald Trump stripped his name off the marquee in 2009.
Altschul said two other Trump projects led by Sater and the developers failed in Phoenix and New York, costing millions. “That’s not a good percentage,” he said.
Lawyers in the petition before the Supreme Court went a step further, saying the court in Brooklyn “illegally” sealed the case, and never ordered Sater to make restitution in the $40 million stock fraud. “[Sater’s] victims were deprived of their rights,” the brief states. “The courts must know that he has been emboldened to continue his frauds.”
When reached on Tuesday, Richard Lerner, the lawyer who filed the petition, declined comment.
The brief also claims the Sater case is among many under seal in the Eastern District of New York, “creating a covert dual justice system accountable to no one, without public notice.”
But the judge who oversaw the Sater case from a decade ago defended the actions of the court, saying he needed to protect the safety of witnesses.
Judge Leo Glasser blasted the lawyers for breaching the court rules, saying they overstepped their bounds in divulging Sater’s record and other highly sensitive information in a civil lawsuit — which has since been sealed.
The judge said the lawyers had “knowingly and intentionally flouted” his order by “unilaterally deciding” to insert Sater’s pre-sentence report — a leaked document— into the suit.
Paul Cassell, a former federal judge who has brought the case to the attention of Congress, said Glasser is just as responsible for the By sealing the case and not ordering Sater to pay back his victims in the stock fraud case, “the [court] illegally gave away millions to a criminal,” said Cassell, who joined an appeal of the case last year.
Tom Julin, a First Amendment lawyer from Miami, said judicial circuits, including the one that takes in Florida, bans the practice of stripping court dockets from public view.
“It’s the worst thing a judge can do,” he said. “In a day and age when economic crimes can affect massive amounts of people there’s a real danger in super sealing these kinds of judicial proceedings.”

Donald Trump is not A president.
He's a so-called president who has no understanding of how the government he finds himself in charge of works, nor does he have the collaborative and diplomatic capabilities the job requires domestically, and certainly not internationally.
For instance. As the UK House of Commons discusses allowing the putz to speak, his old tweets come back to haunt him. I'd assume you know who "Kate" is?
The electoral college should have rejected him as incapable of performing the necessary functions of the orifice, but the electoral college has been a bought-off joke for, literally, centuries.
"...all the odds are on the man who is, intrinsically, the most devious and mediocre -- the man who can most easily (and) adeptly disperse the notion that his mind is a virtual vacuum. The presidency tends, year by year, to go to such men. As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day, the plain folks of the land will reach their heart's desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron." - H.L. Mencken, July 26 1920 Baltimore Sun -

No they didn't. They reported he implied... Bloggers claimed he was discussing a terorist incident:
The Guardian for example: "Donald Trump appears to invent..."
The New York Times: " President Trump escalated his attack on Sweden's migration policies on Monday, doubling down on his suggestion — based on a Fox News report — that refugees in the Scandinavian country were behind a surge in crime and terrorism."
Which WAS the subject he was discussing when he brought up that (also non-existent) "Crime Wave" by immigrants to Sweden

Show me an MSM headline, with link to the article, or any copy from an MSM article and link, that claims Trump was specifically referring to terrorism. They knew very well he was discussing a non-existent crime wave and EVERYONE is still wondering what incident recently 'in Sweden' he was referring to, as is the Swedish government.
Maybe it's this one: Attack in Sweden by neo-Nazis on a refugee centre
The use of vague speech (allowing for plausible deniability) as a propaganda tool is well known and all the bs bloggers created with the 'terrorism' claim THEY created is diverting attention away from the fact that Trump was really making up a 'Swedish Refugee Crime Wave' claim that's just as much bullshit, and allows creeps like you to point away from the LIE he told, and idiots, alot like you, believe it.,.

AAMOF they were never even asked about Muslims at all:
”We’ve got to keep our country safe. You look at what’s happening in Germany. You look at what's happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They're having problems like they never thought possible.”
Trumps comments about Sweden during his rally in Melbourne, Florida, raised many questions, especially among Swedes who were quick to point out that nothing terror-related had happened in the country. The president later took to Twitter to clarify his statements, saying that he was referring to a segment on ”Tucker Carlson Tonight” on Fox News. The segment featured the xenophobic filmmaker Ami Horowitz, maker of an alarmistic movie about Sweden. The movie, titled ”Stockholm Syndrome”, blames immigration as a direct cause of violence and rioting.
Two Swedish police officers were interviewed in the film. Anders Göranzon and Jacob Ekström answered questions about how weapons are becoming more accessible. Horowitz also asked the officers about how crime has spread through cities. But the police officers now say that their answers were taken out of context, and are very critical of how their comments were portrayed on Fox News ”Tucker Carlson Tonight”. ”I don’t understand why we are a part of the segment. The interview was about something completely different to what Fox News and Horowitz were talking about”, says Anders Göranzon.
Why were you interviewed?
”It was supposed to be about crime in high risk areas. Areas with high crime rates. There wasn’t any focus on migration or immigration”.
How did you react to the news segment?
”We don’t stand behind it. It shocked us. He has edited the answers. We were answering completely different questions in the interview. This is bad journalism.”
Anders Göranzon continues: ”It feels like hell. The real questions should be shown along with our answers. We don’t own the rights to the film, but the end result is that we don’t want to talk to journalists after this. We can’t trust each other.”
Have you done anything to stop the news segment?
”We just saw it. What can we do? One thing is talking to you. The excerpt they showed doesn’t say anything, we answered a different question. We don’t stand behind what he says. He is a madman.”
DN has tried to reach Mr. Ami Horowitz for a comment. On Sunday he published a statement on Facebook in regard to the reception of his report from Sweden: ”I think every media outlet across the globe covering my interview with Tucker Carlson and attacking the President is missing the point. Sweden is under assault because of the open door policy to Islamic immigration”.

Meanwhile, Trump's multiple security faux-pas triggers call for House Representative Ted Lieu, a congressman from Los Angeles County, California, led fourteen other House Democrats on Friday in urging the House Government Oversight Committee to investigate "troubling reports" of President Donald Trump's apparently poor security practices and the potential danger to national security posed by them—including his continued use of an unsecured Android device to post to Twitter, discussion of sensitive information (including nuclear strategy) in the restaurant at his Mar-A-Lago resort, and leaving classified material unlocked while visitors were in the Oval Office.
In a letter to Oversight Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz and ranking  > Referring to the complex problem of cybersecurity, President Trump recently said in an interview, "I’m not sure you have the kind of security that you need." We fully agree—which is why we are writing to request that the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hold a hearing into troubling reports that the President is jeopardizing national security by egregiously failing to implement commonsense security measures across the board, from using an insecure, consumer-grade Android smartphone to discussing nuclear strategy openly in a dining room at his Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida. Cybersecurity experts universally agree that an ordinary Android smartphone, which the President is reportedly using despite repeated warnings from the Secret Service, can be easily hacked.
Lieu and the other signatories of the letter expressed concern that Trump's Android device, "most likely the Samsung Galaxy S3," is particularly vulnerable to attack, and that someone could alter the information the President viewed on it—which could "have a huge impact on his beliefs and actions."
They also feared that someone could gain control of his Twitter account, "causing disastrous consequences for global stability," or use it as a listening device to pick up sensitive conversations.
Also cited by the letter were photos from a recent White House visit by Intel CEO Brian Krzanich that showed a key still in the lock of a bag for classified material on Trump's desk. The photo was called out by Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico in this Twitter post:
Additionally, Lieu and the other representatives expressed concern over the continued use of outside e-mail accounts hosted by the Republican National Committee, and compliance with federal records law. "Reports indicate that a political e-mail system used by senior White House staff was hacked in December by a Russian intelligence agency, yet again raising the prospect of the White House being monitored or influenced by unfriendly powers," Lieu and the others wrote. Federal law requires that all e-mails for official business on an outside e-mail system be forwarded or copied into a government e-mail system within 20 days.
The letter calls for the Oversight Committee to look into whether the President is using an unsecured device, whether Trump and the White House staff have been properly briefed and trained on both information security and operational security, and if "the President and the Office of the President [can] ensure that there are no missing e-mails, communications, and technological exchanges—in other words, can they confirm they are not actively being monitored?"

@_subject: Trump Says, 'Lookit Those Swedish Riots!' I Ask, 'Wait, What?' 
First off, the word "Immigrant", as it's being used to describe what's happening due to NATO's nasty wars is just a cutesy MISUSED term for "Displaced War Refugees"
The "Rioting problem" is the 'ghetto-ization' not the immigrants themselves.
If you were displaced and stuck in a slum after YOUR country was destroyed you'd be a little disenfranchised and angry too. Especially your children. Even economic immigrant children have issues. And yes... That's absolutely an apologia for people displaced by the wars the West creates to loot extractive resources.
But let's talk about "Economic Immigrants" not traumatized by war and left without any good psychological care or community support... which was left in the airstrike and artillery rubble of their homeland...
For instance where I live; an area of California with a large population of Mexicans. The parents are hard working and for the most part fastidiously law-abiding, but the children, if the family isn't careful, become gangstas and drug dealers.
But truth be told, for not-so-different sociological reasons, white middle class parents around here are, for the most part, hard working ... but the NA and AA halls are full of their kids, who also 'pack up' occasionally to terrorize the local displaced workers. AKA the "Homeless".
Something Chicano kids, in my 40 years here have NEVER done.
 From the Washington Post...
"In 2015, when the influx of refugees and migrants to Europe from Africa, the Middle East and Asia was highest, Sweden took in the greatest number per capita. By and large, integration has been a success story there, save for incidents such as Monday night's, which have taken place in highly segregated neighborhoods.
The newspaper Dagens Nyheter analyzed crime statistics between October 2015 and January 2016 and came to the conclusion that refugees were responsible for only 1 percent of all incidents. That has done little to assuage the perceptions, even among Swedes, that foreigners are culpable for the crime that does happen. A Pew Research Center study conducted in early 2016 indicated that 46 percent of Swedes believed that “refugees in our country are more to blame for crime than other groups.”
Ripe ground for Fascism. As with Norway where there's been a hard swing to the right as their petro-based economy flounders, it's been seen that Socialism of the Nationalist variety... The kind that stops at your national borders, easily becomes National Socialism when times get economically or socially stressful.
And so it is in 'Merica too. Which despite it's crapitialist underpinnings has required a so-called Welfare State (Nationalist Socialism) to remain... for some part of the population... mostly the white part... stable.

Salient points:
  Also known as "Ghettos"
Yet 46% of Swedes believe these WAR REFUGEES are responsible for some non-existent crime wave.

Actually ISIS traces farther back.... To Libya. Remember Libya? We turned it into an ashtray. A failed state like Somalia... but with modern oil infrastructure.
The group's official name was the LIFG. The US State Department and CIA hired them to sodomize Muammar al-Gadaffi with a bayonet and provided Special Operators and NATO air strike to assist in that goal. THEN they began looting weapons from Libya's armories and taking them to Syria, as the DIA watched and wrote un-acted-on memos => THEN they ran into all the Iraq baathists who had fled Iraq to Syria. THEN we see the inception of what was initially known as ISIS. I seriously doubt the Baathists are still involved though.
As to Why The US Wanted Muammar al-Gadaffi Dead...

PS. You might also note that just about the time they were killing Christopher West, West Point was releasing a study saying the LIFG-affilated areas of Libya supplied the fighters in Iraq most likely to be killing US troops.

@_subject: Domestic Spying: CIA guidelines out-of-compliance for 2 years after 
H/t: Emptywheel:  and  New CIA guidelines set restrictions for incidentally collected intelligence on U.S. persons after 5 years
(Technology Advances Prompt Changes in CIA Collection Procedures)
Robert J. Eatinger, Jr., Former Senior Deputy General Counsel, CIA
In the final few days of the Obama Administration, CIA Director John Brennan, after consulting with the Director of National Intelligence, brought years of CIA and interagency efforts to a close by updating the CIA’s decades-old procedures for collecting, retaining, or disseminating information concerning United States (U.S.) persons.  These updated procedures are promulgated in a document entitled, Central Intelligence Agency Intelligence Activities: Procedures Approved by the Attorney General Pursuant to Executive Order 12333.  In a departure from the past, Director Brennan made these procedures available to the public on the CIA’s Office of Privacy and Civil Liberties webpage.
Before discussing those changes, it may be helpful to start with a basic understanding of the requirement for these procedures.
A few commentators have portrayed Executive Order 12333 as a sort of mysterious, open-ended authorization for U.S. intelligence agencies to engage in secret, questionable activities outside of any judicial or congressional oversight regime.  In other words, some have intimated that it is intended to facilitate and hide intelligence abuses.  It is, in fact, the opposite.  Its purpose is to avoid abuses.
Executive Order 12333 is the latest in a string of executive orders that began in 1976 when President Gerald Ford issued Executive Order 11905 in response to the findings and recommendations of congressional investigations into alleged abuses of Americans’ rights by U.S. intelligence agencies (frequently identified as the Church and Pike Committees).  Among the findings was that a fundamental flaw in the governance of the U.S. intelligence community permitted intelligence abuses. Executive Order 11905 defines the powers of each intelligence community entity, thereby limiting them.  It then imposes some limits on how those powers may be exercised.
Every President since has either promulgated his own executive order, or adopted or amended the existing order. Executive Order 12333, was issued in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan and significantly amended in 2008 by President George W. Bush.  None of these executive orders were classified and all were published in The Federal Register.
Executive Order 12333 sets the basic mission statement of the intelligence community, which includes following the law and respecting rights.  It requires the elements to collect reliable intelligence that provides the President and national leadership “with the necessary information on which to base decisions concerning the development and conduct of foreign, defense, and economic policies, and the protection of United States national interests from foreign security threats.” Executive Order 12333 further directs the intelligence community to collect that intelligence using “[a]ll means, consistent with applicable Federal law and this order, and with full consideration of the rights of United States persons,” and reminds the community of its “solemn obligation . . . to protect fully the legal rights of all United States persons, including freedoms, civil liberties, and privacy rights guaranteed by Federal law.”
Executive Order 12333 limits the types of and methods by which information concerning U.S. persons may be collected, retained, or disseminated.  It then authorizes elements to engage in such collection, retention, and dissemination only as permitted by procedures approved by the Attorney General. The Attorney General formally approved CIA’s 12333 Procedures on January 17, 2017.
The CIA’s 12333 Procedures supersede procedures that had been written in 1982 and sparingly updated since.  The changes made in the updated procedures reflect not only developments in U.S. law and policy, but also advances in collection methods due to changes in technology and privacy interests unforeseen in 1982, which did not contemplate the ubiquitous use of mobile phones, computers, and other digital media devices or evolving views of privacy and thus did not seek to address “big data” or “bulk” collection. Sections 5 and 6 in CIA’s 12333 Procedures contain procedures specifically addressed to these developments.  These sections also satisfy the requirements to create procedures that limit to five years the retention of any nonpublic telephone or electronic communication acquired without the consent of a person who is a party to the communication except in defined circumstances (Section 309).
Section 5 and 6 also contain new procedures to address privacy interests implicated by foreign intelligence collection methods required in a globally interconnected digital world that did not exist in 1982.  As the CIA Statement notes, in 1982, “a clandestine operation may have resulted in the CIA collecting a limited number of hard copy documents.  Today, in addition to traditional intelligence scenarios, a single storage device may contain the equivalent of millions of pages of information, hours of video, thousands of photos, or more.”  The dominance of the digital environment has resulted in circumstances in which foreign intelligence on terrorists, proliferators, and other foreign intelligence targets reside within data streams and digital repositories that also contain substantial volumes of information concerning U.S. persons.
In order to find the foreign intelligence information, however, intelligence agencies at times must capture the entire data stream or digital repository (“bulk collection”) because technical, practical, or operational realities do not permit targeted collection.  Such collection captures not only the information of intelligence value that the intelligence agency wants, but also the information concerning U.S. persons that the intelligence agency does not want.  In such cases, the U.S. person information in the bulk collection is considered to be “incidental collection,” because its acquisition was not the purpose of the collection operation.  While such incidentally acquired U.S. person information is presumed not to be of foreign intelligence interest or value, its residence on an intelligence agency server raises privacy concerns.  The Sections 5 and 6 procedures seek to address these concerns.
Section 5 protects privacy interests by establishing procedures to minimize the use of bulk collection to circumstances in which it is necessary and ensure proper audit, thereby seeking to prevent CIA from acquiring unwanted U.S. person information in the first place, except when necessary.  Section 5 requires the preparation of specific documentation prior to or as soon as practicable after any intelligence activity that results in bulk collection or acquires more information than the CIA’s can evaluate promptly, or qualifies for retention without individualized review.  The documentation must contain certain information necessary for identified senior officials to determine whether to approve the collection.
Assuming the collection has been determined to be permissible, Section 6 addresses privacy concerns by establishing handling requirements and retention limits for the portion of the bulk collection containing U.S. person information of no intelligence value or interest:  the unevaluated information.
Section 6 creates two different types of handling requirements for unevaluated information; one for “routine” handling and one for “exceptional” handling.  Exceptional handling requirements apply to intelligence collections either of nonpublic communications that were acquired without the consent of a party to the communication, or that are anticipated to contain U.S. person identifying information that is significant in volume, proportion, or sensitivity.  The exceptional requirements include segregating the unevaluated information, limiting access to CIA employees who receive special training, creating an auditable record of activity, and importantly, requiring such information to be destroyed no later than five years after collection, permitting extensions in limited circumstances.
The five-year limit in Section 6 is but one example of how specifics in the new procedures attempt to find the right balance of intelligence and privacy interests.  Each procedure involves an effort to find the right tradeoffs to allow lawful intelligence collection and protect privacy and civil liberty rights and interests. The tradeoff was between the risk to a loss in intelligence capabilities by destroying information at five years against the risk to compromising privacy interests by keeping the information longer.
Deleting all unevaluated information specifically concerning U.S. persons has little to no intelligence downside because intelligence agencies will never want or have reason to search their intelligence holdings.  The five-year period to destroy all unevaluated information, however, will remove not only information concerning U.S. persons but also any information potentially concerning valid intelligence targets, such as international terrorists, from the intelligence agencies holdings.  In this latter case, however, intelligence agencies will want and may have a reason to search its holdings for information on these targets. The deletion of that information could thus have an adverse intelligence impact, particularly on counterterrorism and counterproliferation intelligence reporting, as well as on the conduct of human intelligence operations, all of which are important activities of the CIA.
The CIA could be expected to search all of its holdings upon receiving intelligence identifying a previous unknown person as a suspected terrorist or proliferator.  Under the five-year retention period, when the CIA conducts the search, any unevaluated information on that person that may have been acquired during a bulk collection activity over five years ago will have been deleted; CIA’s search will not retrieve that information. Thus, CIA might gain an incomplete or misleading understanding of the individual, his place in a terrorist network, and his contacts.  Or, CIA may send intelligence officers to conduct dangerous human intelligence operations to collect information it once had.  The loss of five-year old information could also adversely impact the spotting, assessing, recruiting, and running of human sources.  Safe and effective source operations are enhanced by the amount of information available to CIA and the handling officer(s).  How often the five-year retention limit might result in a loss of important information is unknowable.
The five-year retention period in Section 6 was not set by the CIA, DNI, or Attorney General, however, it was set by Congress through Section 309.  Certainly, differing mission requirements among the individual intelligence community elements translate into differing retention needs.  Some intelligence entities likely could accomplish their mission and destroy unevaluated information in less than five years.  Others may need to retain information longer than five years.  Without question, the congressional intelligence committees sought and considered the input of the intelligence community entities before setting a retention limit. Congress has provided that intelligence agency heads may retain information longer than five years if the head determines a longer retention “is necessary to protect the national security of the United States” and certifies in writing to the intelligence committees the reasons for that determination, the new retention period, the particular information to be retained; and the measures that will be taken to protect the privacy interests of U.S. persons and persons located inside the United States.
Given the uncertainties of adequately assessing the relative risks to intelligence operations and privacy, and the diversity of considerations among intelligence agencies, if a single retention period was to be imposed on the entire intelligence community, the right body to do so was the one comprised of the People’s representatives: the Congress.

They aren't. You know why? When the Second Amendment was written, at 50 yards or so, you could literally outrun a musketball. If it didn't bounce off your coat. Besides, "Your puny AK-47 is useless. So, we need to have at least some of our volunteer resistance show up with Stinger missiles, some anti-aircraft batteries, maybe a submarine or two?" I hear Soros has a fleet of A-10 Warthogs he might call into service too if you talk to him purty.
 From a LIBERTARIAN legal wonkblog:
Randazza: You Are Not Going to Resist the Government With Your Guns
December 7, 2015 by Randazza
"Bullshit quote memes piss me off so bad that I want to stab someone in their fat stupid face!" – Fred Rogers
I'm not prepared to get rid of our right to keep and bear arms unless we do get rid of the Second Amendment. But, doing that requires tinkering with the Constitution, which makes me nervous. Once you open the hood, you never know what else someone will fuck with. With the state of our idiocracy, opening the Constitution is just as likely to wind up creating a right to keep and bear rape monkeys as it is to have its intended effect.
So it is what it is. We have the Second Amendment, and while we can debate all we want about how we should interpret it, DC v. Heller pretty much did that for us. It is an individual right, and anyone who suggests that we might even ponder a dissenting view is not very likely to make it through Senate confirmation hearings.
So here we are.
Fallacy Killer Number One – George Washington Did Not Say That
Lets talk about one justification for our right to keep and bear arms — the notion that we need the Second Amendment so that we can resist This George Washington quote sprouts up like mushrooms on cow shit every time there is a mass shooting – to remind us that even though a dozen kids just died, it is worth it, because one day we will want those guns – like the day that Obama comes to herd us into concentration camps where we will be forced to have free health care, or education, or Koran lessons, or whatever the fear-du-jour happens to be.
     "A free people ought not only be armed and disciplined, but they should have sufficient arms and ammunition to maintain a status of independence from any who might attempt to abuse them, which would include their own government." -George Washington
Well guess what?
He never said that.
Here is what he actually said:
     "A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well-digested plan is requisite; and their safety and interest require that they should promote such manufactories as tend to render them independent of others for essential, particularly military, supplies."
Pretty big difference by shifting a few words around.
Fallacy Killer Number Two – The Second Amendment Will Preserve Our Right to Revolt
Just because Washington didn't say that, it doesn't mean that there is no "right to revolution" theory to be found in the Second Amendment. After all, Jefferson did say "The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural In 1776, when the height of military technology was a musket and a cannon, both of which you could make by melting down church bells, there might have been something to it. When the contest was little more than numbers of guns you could drag through the woods, and how to play the weather, the government probably did need to worry a bit about insurrection – and that might have kept them a bit more honest.
However, the first time someone tried that kind of thing, it didn't work out so well. In fact, Shays' Rebellion just led to Constitutional tweaks to make the federal government that much stronger. The Civil War led to even more, with harsher consequences.
If 13 states, with the assistance of at least one superpower, didn't manage to get their way through armed insurrection, what the hell makes anyone think that armed insurgency is going to preserve our right to … whatever … not have affordable health care, or to coffee cups that say "Happy Birthday Jesus" on them?
Ok, fine… lets come up with a cause worth fighting for. Lets say that Obama refuses to step down in 2016, and he not only declares himself dictator-for-life, but he also starts dressing like Ghadaffi, decrees that the national religion shall be Islam, the national language will be Klingon, there will be an efficient rail network in the United States, the writ of Prima Noctae is now in effect, and there shall be martial law to enforce all of the above, as well as any other laws that the President invents, on a daily basis.
We managed to preserve our right to keep military grade rifles and machine guns, so we all muster down on the Town Common with our guns. We tried voting. We tried protesting. This is a reasonable time to start with the armed insurrection stuff.
So, you, me, all our neighbors, hell our entire city builds a perimeter around it. We fill sandbags, we all have ammunition, we all have food, water, supplies, and most importantly, we are all unified and in complete solidarity.
And we stand there, resisting whatever it is the government was going to do to us.
And then they fly over with one jet, dropping one FAE bomb, and roll in with three tanks, and in about 12 hours, our "resistance" is reduced to a few smoking holes. The Tree of Liberty will get its manure all right, but it will be the manure that you shat out as you ran for cover, as long range artillery rains down on our town, as we get carpet bombed from 35,000 feet, and as the sky goes black with drones and cruise missiles.
We're screwed.
So… if the 2nd Amendment's "right to revolution" implication is real, both practically and legally, it must also include a right to possess tanks, jets, rocket launchers, etc. Your puny AK-47 is useless. So, we need to have at least some of our volunteer resistance show up with Stinger missiles, some anti-aircraft batteries, maybe a submarine or two?
Oh, you can't afford that?
That's ok, we have some patriotic citizens who can.
Who? The same billionaires who already own the government, that's who. So what do they want to "resist?" I could only see them wanting to resist checks on their own power. So, if the Second Amendment implies a right to resist the government, then that would mean that we need our billionaire friends to start stockpiling these weapons now. We need a Koch brothers airfield with a few fighters and bombers, and Adelson should have a fleet of tanks somewhere, and I guess that George Soros would bring his collection of nuke-armed submarines up to date, right?
So lets drop the crazy scenario of Obama-cum-Ghadaffi, and just think about something we were really likely to see upset us. Do you think for a moment that you, living in some apartment in Salt Lake City, or a house in Wyoming, or a condo in Boca Raton, would be ready to go to war with the Federal Government over the same shit that would get the Koch Brothers to fuel up their private stock of A10 Warthogs? Really?
Because you know what the billionaires want the government to stop doing? They want it to get out of the way of their becoming trillionaires. If you think that the Second Amendment means what the Supreme Court said in Heller, and you believe that is a good thing, because it gives you the ability to resist the government, you might want to play out the long game in your head. The long game here is this interpretation leads to private armies, raised by limitless wealth, all of which looks at our quaint little republican form of government as nothing more than a paper justification to have a flag waving over a few national parks.
I don't particularly love the federal government either, but ultimately, it is the only organization that we have where we can even hope to band together with enough authority to avoid being under the rule of the richest local family. Yeah, in large part, we're there already. Citizens United made sure of that. But, at least we still have some veneer of a So the next time you see some fool cheering the Second Amendment as the text that protects us from tyranny, ask them to play all four quarters of the mental game. It isn't romantic pictures of regular guys crossing the Delaware in rowboats. The endgame is Ancient Rome meets The Terminator.
[Update] – A few comments suggest that our modern military has not really been that effective against insurgencies in Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, and elsewhere. I concede that point. But, I did not think I needed to waste a paragraph in the original discussing how I hardly think that Americans would be prepared to hide in the woods and caves, en masse, to support an American insurgency. Not a chance. When our intelligentsia is crying for "safe spaces," our would-be "Wolverines" scream to give up every civil liberty except the Second Amendment, who are we going to have lead this "insurgency?" Maybe the Crips and the Bloods. That ought to work out well. Sorry, but anyone you might want to be in power doesn't have the yarbles to do it, and those with the great bolshy yarblockos are not exactly going to set up a rebel government on the principles of Oliver Wendell Holmes.

    Flag” boarded several pickup trucks, each outfitted with Confederate
    and American flags, and embarked on a drive around Douglasville,
    Ga., a small city west of Atlanta.
    Tensions concerning the Confederate flag were already high. Barely a
    month had passed since Dylann Roof, the avowed white supremacist who
    had posed with the Confederate battle flag, killed nine black
    Americans at a church in Charleston.
    And the small Respect the Flag group went far beyond a display of
    Confederate pride.
    Hatred, a Georgia judge said during a sentencing Monday, propelled
    the group as they descended upon a child’s birthday party, unleashed
    a storm of death threats and anti-black slurs, and pointed a shotgun.
    “Their actions were motivated by racial hatred,” said Judge William
    McClain, of the Douglas County Superior Court, according to the
    Associated Press. Georgia legislature does not include a law
    regarding hate crimes.
    The 10 men and five women who made up Respect the Flag harassed
    black drivers as well as customers at a Walmart and a convenience store.
    Then they happened upon a birthday party for an 8-year-old black
    child. Witnesses told the Southern Poverty Law Center, a nonprofit
    group that tracks hate crimes, that after driving the trucks across
    the property belonging to the child’s grandmother, the men got out
    of the vehicles and began to yell racial epithets and shout death
    threats.
    “They even threatened to kill children at the party,” according to a
    statement issued by Douglas County District Attorney Brian Fortner
    in early February. One of the men, 26-year-old Jose Ismael Torres,
    pointed a pump shotgun at the partygoers, prosecutors said. Several
    panicked people called the police.
    “Everywhere you went, 911 call centers were flooded with calls,” the
    judge said, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.
    “I was scared,” Melissa Alford, the host of the party, told the
    Southern Poverty Law Center in October, a few days after the group’s
    members were indicted. “My first thought was if these people start
    shooting at us, we wouldn’t be able to get all the kids inside the
    house in time.”
    The defendants in the case argued that a party attendee triggered
    the incident by hurling an object at one of the trucks. Cellphone
    video taken at the scene showed otherwise, the judge said.
    “If you drive around town with a Confederate flag, yelling the
    n-word, you know how it’s going to be interpreted,” the judge said,
    per Atlanta’s Fox 5. “It’s inexplicable to me that you weren’t
    arrested by the police that day.”
    The members of the group, two of whom pleaded guilty, were convicted
    in early February.
    Following the convictions, the Douglas County district attorney
    issued a statement clarifying that this case was not an issue of the
    First Amendment but of harassment.
    “Many people tried to make the case about simply flying the
    Confederate battle flag. However, it wasn’t about that at all,”
    Fortner said in the statement. “Instead, this case was about a group
    of people riding around our community, drinking alcohol, harassing
    and intimidating our citizens because of the color of their skin.”
    The judge handed down the final two sentences on Monday. Torres was
    sentenced to 20 years, serving 13 in prison. The mother of his
    children, Kayla Rae Norton, 25, was sentenced to 15 years and will
    serve six. After their prison terms, they will be banished from
    Douglas County. They were found in violation of Street Gang
    Terrorism and Prevention Act; Norton was found guilty of violating
    the act as well as a count of making terroristic threats. The jury
    convicted Torres of three counts of aggravated assault, one count of
    making terroristic threats and one count of violating the act.
    The scene in the courtroom was an emotional one. Both Torres and
    Norton cried as their sentences were announced, the Associated Press
    reported. Norton apologized to the victims.
    One of the victims, Hyesha Bryant, expressed her forgiveness. “I
    forgive you,” Bryant said. “And to your family, I’m sorry it had to
    come this far.”

Oh but there WAS a reason.
Anyone familiar with the 'underground' of Manhattan or saw what happened
to the Harkins Slough flyway on Highway one north of Watsonville
California during the Loma Prieta Earthquake could explain it to someone
who didn't have 'shit in their ears' and a mind full of shit to match.
The ground underneath it, right next to the slough, liquefied. Shock
does that to mud, and everything in Manhattan below 14th st is mud, and
a honeycomb of subway tunnels, boiler rooms, underground passageways,
and building substructures just as deep as the building are tall, and
the shock wave from the WTC tower hits liquefied the mud, and undermined
the (shoddily constructed) building 7.
It's really that simple. Even a child, or someone STOOPID could
understand it, but truthers are WAY beyond Stoopid... Mental midgets.
And they like it like that. Because if they admitted to themselves that
THEIR VERY WAY OF LIFE was responsible for 9/11, they'd have no way to
cope with the responsibility.

The fact that the ground in Manhattan below 14th street is mud and
honeycombed with building substructures as deep as the buildings are
tall is NOT a "theory".
Nor is the reason why the Harkins Slough flyway sank into the mud during
the Loma Prieta Earthquake due to liquification a "Theory". My ex drove
the pickup truck through it (the CHP was too busy to have set up
roadblocks yet) on the way to pick me up after securing the kids and
described the roadbed sitting almost at water level with the support
columns NOT visible and sunk in the mud.
I can't speak for the pancaking of the I-880 flyway in the Bay Area not
knowing the geology of the land under it but you'd think an earthquake
rocking it would toss it sideways. Especially considering the contractor
building it had skimped on the reinforcing rebar. However the top deck
collapsed directly on top of the deck below, killing and wounding a

in real time. Doesn't matter what the poster meant it to prove. The
footage speaks for itself. Only an idiot wouldn't know it was going to
collapse, and as I said you're an idiot so I'll spell it out
It had already internally collapsed which is why the fuel storage tank
IN the building (because the construction was cheapskate like the towers
and the builders didn't want to pay for the permits necessary for an
outdoor tank) fell through a number of floors and burned the fucking
thing out. Until the roof... The thing that keeps torsional forces from
affecting the frame of the building, fell in. That, combined with the
internal structural damage and the undermining off it's substructure,
was the end.
That whole area of downtown Manhattan had to have a few taller buildings
torn down because of the undermining of the building substructures. The
East side of the tip of Manhattan at the time was mostly low-slung
buildings with not so much to damage. You and your idiot friends make it

Because resonance is a universal physical principle. I have proved that
(at least) the shock wave of a 255,000 lb 'tuning fork' striking the
buildings nearby caused a resonance in the ground below which is mud
with wood or metal sticks vertically inserted (pilings) and it affected
the building's (the piece of paper or stir stick) stability, and the
building we're discussing, already seriously damaged and unstable from

Link to web page at bottom
HI all, and hope great things for you in 2017.  Am sharing the link for
a podcast from the John W. Kluge Center at the Library of Congress, an
interview with me about my project on the idea of peace in the Qur'an,
the Muslim scripture.  For those who prefer to read, I am appending the
transcript in this message.
 ================================
JASON STEINHAUER:  Hey there, everyone.  This is Jason Steinhauer from
The John W. Kluge Center at the Library of Congress.  We are podcasting
from inside the Library, Ground Floor of the Thomas Jefferson Building,
and today, we're talking about the idea of peace in the Quran.  And
we're talking today with?  JUAN COLE:  Juan Cole.
MR. STEINHAUER:  —who is the 2016 Kluge Chair in Countries and Cultures
of the South, here at the Kluge Center at the Library of Congress.  He
has been with us for the past 3 months.
So, Juan, I wanted to start really, really basic for our listeners, and
so I am going to ask a very, very simple question to start, which is
simply what is the Quran.
MR. COLE:  The Quran is the Muslim scriptures analogous to the Hebrew
Bible or the New Testament.  It's a repository of what are characterized
by revelations to the Prophet Muhammad, who lived roughly 570 to 632 of
the common era.
MR. STEINHAUER:  Okay.  And can you tell us a little bit about the Quran
itself?  Do we know who wrote it?  Do we know when it was written?  What
do we know about the text itself?
MR. COLE:  Well, Muslims believe that it is revelation from God, so they
believe God wrote it, and however, they believe that it was conveyed to
humankind by the angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad, who lived in
Western Arabia in the late antique period.
MR. STEINHAUER:  So before Muhammad, were there people in that region,
and what did they believe?  Who did they worship, or what did they
worship?  What was the background and context in which Muhammad was living?
MR. COLE:  Right.  Well, the region is called the Hijaz, and it's where
Mecca, the holy city of Islam now is, where millions of people go to
pilgrimage every year.  So that strip of coast along the Red Sea was a
frontier.  It hadn't been entirely incorporated into the Roman Empire,
and it was being encroached on from the South maybe by the Iranian
Empire at the time, the Sassanids, but it was like the Old West.  It was
just the sheriff.  You know, there wasn't any government around, and
there were tribes people there.  There were urban dwellers.  And they
hadn't, for the most part, apparently, adopted any of the great
classical religions of that period.  The Roman Empire, of course, had
become largely Christian by then.  The Iranian Empire was largely
Zoroastrian, but the people in that region adhered to an old pagan
religion of North Arabian gods and goddesses.
MR. STEINHAUER:  So they had multiple deities that they may have worshipped?
MR. COLE:  Yes.
MR. STEINHAUER:  Interesting.  And so Muhammad is born into that
environment, into that society?
MR. COLE:  That's right.  He's born into a prominent clan of Mecca, the
Hashim clan, but there's some thinking from the text of the Quran that
people in that area were under the influence of Judaism and Christianity
and Zoroastrianism, all of which were monotheistic religions, that they
were reshaping their own local religion.  They were shipped a creator
god just called "God," and in Arabic, that's Allah, but it's not a
personal name.  The Christians called "God" by the same word.  It just
means god.
Their thought to have seen him as unlike any of the other deities and
maybe to be in the process of reducing the lesser deities to angels, and
so they weren't quite monotheist, but maybe they were moving in that
MR. STEINHAUER:  Let's talk a little bit about Muhammad.  Who was
Muhammad?  Tell us a little bit about his life, his early years.
MR. COLE:  He was an orphan.  His father died while his mother was
pregnant.  His father had been on a caravan journey up north to Gaza and
died on his way back.  His mother died when the prophet was still a
child, and then he went to stay with his grandfather for a couple
years.  Then his grandfather died, and then he went to stay with his
uncle, Abu Talib.  And it is said that Abu Talib took him on a caravan
journey up to Syria when he was 12, that he later married a wealthy
woman merchant, Khadijah, who was a pillar of the community, very
upright, and she managed these caravan journeys for trade, and that he
impressed her with his mercantile acumen, and that they married.
But then around 610, the traditional stories say that the Prophet
Muhammad began receiving revelations from God through the angel Gabriel.
MR. STEINHAUER:  And so how old would he have been at that time?
MR. COLE:  Forty.
MR. STEINHAUER:  At 40.  So, at 40, he began to see revelations.  So
what was the nature of the revelations, at least what has come down to us?
MR. COLE:  Well, the firmest evidence for them is in the Quran, and
there, there are descriptions of visions of the prophet ascending to
heaven, where he sees the angel at the throne of God.  There is also an
element of prophecy that the last days are coming, the judgment day is
coming, and there's the strong emphasis on the moral life, that people
should not be stingy towards orphans and the poor, that they should
share their wealth a little bit, that they should live moral lives. They should be faithful to their spouses.  They should avoid various
sins and so forth.  So there are these three elements of the visionary,
the apocalyptic, and the moral.
MR. STEINHAUER:  And do these come for the rest of his life?  Do these
come only in a span of a few months or years, or do we know?
MR. COLE:  Well, according to the traditions, they did come for the rest
of his life until he died in 632, and so the Quran is traditionally
thought to be a book that gradually accumulates of these individual
revelations from 610 to 632.
MR. STEINHAUER:  So let's talk a little bit about some of the ideas,
then, that weigh into the Quran and into the sort of spread of this
religion that becomes Islam because, in some of the material you've
shared with me, you talk about how this ascent to heaven, there is sort
of an element of piece and serenity that is sort of endemic to that
revelation or that vision.  Can you talk a little bit about that aspect
of it?
MR. COLE:  Yes.  Well, what I am finding in my research is that peace is
very central to the message of the Quran and of Islam, and, of course,
"peace" as a word means a lot of different things.  There's inner peace
that someone might have.  There's a celestial peace.  There's peace with
nature, and then there is peace within a community and between the
community and others.  So all of those kinds of peace are apparent in
the Quran, but I think the earliest form in which peace is emphasized in
the book has to do with heaven.  So, when you arrive in heaven, the
angels greet you saying, "Peace."
And my research suggests to me that heaven and these apocalyptic works
of the late antique period was thought to have levels like—you know, it
shows up in Dante later, the same thing.
MR. STEINHAUER:  Uh-huh.
MR. COLE:  So I think as far as I can see, the highest level in heaven
is when God addresses you, and only the very righteous get this level,
and God says "Peace" to you.  Then the revelation itself is represented
as peace.  There's a chapter of the Quran that talks about the night
that the revelation first came.  The last verse of it is "And peace it
is until the breaking of dawn."  The peace that it is is the peace of
revelation, of the assurance of God's contact with human beings, his
guidance, and the inner peace that comes from worship and pure prayer. So that heavenly peace is mirrored on earth by the peace of the
believers, and that seems to me to be a complex that follows through the
And then, at some point, the Quran actually gives names to God.  God is
the just, the all-seeing, the omnipotent and so forth.  The names that
it gives him is peace.  God is peace.  So I think this is—the divine,
the heavenly, and then the earthly worship, all—the pinnacle there is peace.
MR. STEINHAUER:  And so is that supposed to teach us that on earth, the
pinnacle of behavior is peace, and if we follow that, we get to the
pinnacle of heaven which is peace?  Is there a correlation there?
MR. COLE:  Yeah.  I think very much so that it's implied that heaven, as
it's described in the Quran, is the ideal society, and so it's being
held up as an ideal for what the best life on earth might look like.
MR. STEINHAUER:  Now, traditionally, I think when we hear the word
"peace" at least in our modern day, we think about wars among people,
wars between nations.  What does the Quran have to say about that?  Is
peace in that sense of the word throughout the revelations as well in
the scriptures?
MR. COLE:  Well, the traditional account of the life of the prophet
falls into two eras.  One is when he begins preaching in his hometown of
Mecca from 610 to 622, and then the second period is when he is forced
out of Mecca by his pagan enemies.  And he and his community have to
relocate to the nearby city of Medina, and he's there until 632.
So, in the Meccan period, in the first period, the Quran seems to me to
recommend almost a kind of pacifism to the Muslims.  There's a verse
that talks about they were humiliated and ridiculed and boycotted, but
the Quran praises those who walk humbly upon the earth, and when they
are ridiculed, they reply to their tormenters, "Peace.  Peace be upon
you," which is a prayer for peace.  So they are turning the other
cheek.  It's almost Christian.
And there are limits to it.  The Quran is not a pacifist document.  I
think nobody would make that argument.  I would say that the Quran's
approach to these matters, it does allow, even in this early Meccan
period, I think, a violence to protect the weak or in self-defense in
the face of highway robbery.  The word that's used is a little obscure. It's that if there's a murder of if there is someone wreaking corruption
in the land, that it's permissible to take up arms.  And remember
there's no government in this part of Arabia.  It's a consensual tribal
system.  So everybody is on their own.  There's no jails.  There's no
authority.  So, if somebody attacks your family, the Quran does permit
you to defend them.
But short of, I'm arguing, something like lethal violence or a very
severe violation of someone's rights, it's recommending peace, even with
the pagan community.  Even with people who believe in multiple gods and
who are actively persecuting the Muslims, the Quran's earliest
recommendations are for the Muslims to face that in a peaceful and
ironic way, and it uses the word "jihad" in this period.  It says—but it
means struggle, not war.
MR. STEINHAUER:  So I want to talk a little bit now about how this
message spreads because you mentioned it in passing about how Muhammad
went on to preach across the region, and at the beginning, of course, I
guess everybody was a nonbeliever, right?  You had to get people on
board with this.  So how does he then take this message out?  And when
he's taking that message out and preaching, is it a message of peace? Is it a message of warning that Dooms Day is coming?  Do we know what
the tone of that message was?
MR. COLE:  Well, the Quran is actually fairly clear on these matters. First of all, the Quran doesn't make a division on the basis of
religion.  It makes a division on the basis of theology.  So people who
believe in one god and who live a moral life are saved, according to
Quran, and this is a very challenging doctrine in this period because
you know the Roman Empire didn't think that way.  They had become very
strong Chalcedonian Christians, and they persecuted people, pagans, who
still tried to perform the old rites to Zeus and Hera and so forth.  And
they even persecuted Christians who didn't accept the Nicene Creed or
didn't accept the Chalcedonian interpretation of Christianity.
So the Quran really has a broad-minded view of these things, but it does
theologically condemn polytheism.  So anybody who dilutes God's
uniqueness and associates other gods with God is doing something wrong
and will go to hell, according to the Quran.  But there's not an
implication in the Mecca period at least that you should, therefore, be
meant to them.  You should preach to them and try to convince them and
save them, but there's not a sense of enmity.  In the Medinan period, Muhammad went to the neighboring city of Yathrib
or Medina.  The Meccans were intent on crushing this new religion, and
they had developed an enmity with Muhammad, and they seemed to have
expelled him from the city.  And Mecca was a sanctuary.  You're not
supposed to kill people there.  So somebody who is living there was kind
of Teflon, but once Muslims were expelled from Mecca, then they could be
killed.  And there were then three wars between the Muslims and the
pagan Meccans, according to the traditional sources, in the Medinan period.
But even then, the Quran says defend yourselves, fight them wherever you
find them if they're attacking you, but if they come to you and sue for
peace, you must make peace with them.  So the ideal is ultimately peace,
but it is allowed that there is such a thing as a just war, and the
Muslims view those wars with Mecca is just wars.
MR. STEINHAUER:  And it strikes me that this is really sort of an
amazing story in our human history that this religion, it starts
relatively late compared to the other two major monotheistic religions,
and it becomes the dominant religion in the region fairly quickly.
MR. COLE:  It's a few decades later.  The Prophet Muhammad died in 632. By the next two or three decades, the Muslims had taken over the
southern third of the old Roman Empire on the other side of the
Mediterranean from Rome and had taken over the old Iranian Sassanid
Empire.  So they very quickly got to the point where Muslim rule
stretched from Southern Spain in the early 700s to the borders of China
beyond Afghanistan.  That was an empire . It made a Muslim ruling class
of conquerors, but most people were Christian, Zoroastrian, Jewish, and
so it was a multicultural—there were even pagan communities, and so it
was a multicultural empire and remained so for hundreds of years.  I
mean, many of these societies, like Egypt, might not have become
majority Muslim until the Medieval period, say the 1200s.
MR. STEINHAUER:  And, of course, those regions are still heavily, if not
predominantly, Muslim today, and you have—in your career, you have both
lived in that region.  You have written extensively about that region. It's interesting that you've done so much research about the current
Middle East, and now you're also going back and looking sort of at the
origins of the story in some way.  Can you talk a little bit about maybe
how the Quran functions today inside Islam and inside the Middle East,
and do these messages of peace—are they still understood to be there, or
have they been sort of shifted or distorted a little bit?
MR. COLE:  Well, as I suggested, it seems to me that one of the great
tragedies of the history of Islam is that the Quran got overruled.  It
got overruled in a number of ways.  One way was that these folk sayings
that were attributed to the Prophet Muhammad gained a kind of canonical
status, and some of them—you know, I don't mean to offend anybody in the
Muslim community, but some of them, quite frankly, obviously contradict
the text of the Quran.  You can't have both of them in many instances,
and so the Quran gets overruled by them.  And most of those sayings come
from a period when Islam had become an empire in its kind of feudal
society, and so they're much more warlike than the Quran text itself
usually is.
And then another thing that happened was that the Muslim clergy
developed a doctrine or a theory of the Quran that later verses abrogate
earlier verses.  So many of the verses that I was talking about of a
peaceful nature are alleged by some of the clergy to have been abrogated
by later verses, which talk about just war and so forth.  So between
being overruled by the sayings and doings of the Hadith and being
overruled by the clergy—and one clergyman said he could find 110 verses
of the Quran that had been abrogated by a later verse and so forth—often
these aspects of the text that I'm interested in are not being
foregrounded in the contemporary community.
And often they'll quote half of a verse or half of a principle.  So the
Quran has a kind of rhetorical convention where it will make a broad
statement, and then it will come back and modify it.  So it will say,
you know, fight the unbelievers wherever you find them or kill them in
war, but then it will say, "But if they sue for peace, then you must
make peace with them."  Well, these fundamentalists leave out the second
part, right?  And so a lot of the discourse of a group like ISIL, which
has taken over part of Syria and Iraq, if you look at the way they
deploy the Quran, it's intellectually dishonest from beginning to end
because it only quotes very selectively.
MR. STEINHAUER:  And you wrote a book recently about new Arabs and
millennials in the Middle East.  I mean, do you get the sense that the
Quran still really resonates with that generation that's not more maybe
tech savvy and more connected globally to what's happening in others
places in the world?
MR. COLE:  Well, actually, a lot of the youth that were prominent in the
2011 youth revolves throughout the region are frankly rather
secular-minded.  Some of them, their parents were Marxists or Arab
nationalists with a socialist bent, and the polling suggests that, in
some countries—this is not universal, but in some countries—Lebanon and
Tunisia standout—there is a very distinct difference in the degree of
religious observance, not necessarily a belief, but of observance
between the older generation and the younger.  In Tunisia, it's a
15-point spread, and in Lebanon, it's more like 50 percent of the
millennial youth don't seem to be very interested in religion.
I think, actually, the rise of ISIL, which happened after my book came
out, has accelerated this trend.  I think a lot of youth are pretty
disgusted by religious fundamentalism.
MR. STEINHAUER:  So, by taking on this project, by trying to go back to
the Quran and find these threads of peace in it, what do you think your
contribution can be?
MR. COLE:  Well, I think that there's been a lot of writing about war
and Islam and war and the Quran.  There are many books about the idea of
jihad or holy war, and I did a literature search for the Quran and
peace.  And I tried lots of different combinations of words and so
forth, and I don't find very many journal articles or books on that
So, again, the Quran is not a pacifist document, and I'm not making that
argument.  But it does have ideas about peace in it and reconciliation
and social harmony and inner peace and spirituality, and it seems to me
odd that we shouldn't also investigate those aspects of the scripture.

Malicious power chargers too!
The internet of things hates you.
Google has shut down a "high-severity" exploit in its Nexus 6 and 6P
phones which gave attackers with USB access the opportunity to take over
the onboard modem during boot-up—allowing them to listen in on
phonecalls, or intercept mobile data packets.
The vulnerability was part of a cluster of security holes found by
security researchers at IBM's X-Force all related to a flaw—tagged
CVE-2016-8467—in the phones' bootmode, which uses malware-infected PCs
and malicious power chargers to access hidden USB interfaces. Patches
were rolled out before the vulnerabilities were made public, in November
for the Nexus 6, and January for the 6P.
The exploit also allowed access to find the phone's "exact GPS
coordinates with detailed satellite information, place phone calls,
steal call information, and access or change nonvolatile items or the
EFS partition."
It was complex to activate, requiring the victim to have Android Debug
Bridge (ADB) enabled on their devices—a debugging mode used by
developers to load APKs onto Android phones—and to have manually
authorised ADB connectivity with the infected PC or charger. However,
according to the researchers, there were significant workarounds.

The people need to change alot before anything changes 'globally'. Given
that people are bombarded by (at least) marketing campaigns for shiny
plastic stuff people are dying making in places they never see, and the
evil underlying semantic of every speck of that brain-bombardment is
"You aren't a good enough human being unless you have [specific and

on the horizon. We've been pitted against each other from ethnic hatred

Where is that voice from nowhere to remind us that the holy ground we

Who among us can give translation of autumn hues to morning news?
The anchorman thrown overboard has simply rooted us in histories

A nation in its saddened years that wont acknowledge karma
Where is the voice from nowhere, the ones your prophets spoke of?
There are voices from fear disconnected from their diaphragms, dangling
from coffee covered teeth that spill into our laps and scorch our privates
There are voices from the sides of necks, some already noosed, dangling

Serving life in corner offices and ghetto corners, their voices are the same
Dead to themselves, numb to the possibility of truth existing beyond

There are voices of elders, which seem to do no more than damn us to our

Your holy books written in red ink on burning sands
Your prayers between rounds do no more than fasten the fate of your

A truth that mushrooms its darkened cloud over the rest of us
So that we too bear witness to the short lived fate of a civilization

Your weapons are phallic, all of them

His shrunken pale face leaves little room for imagination
We have spotted your moving lips and have pinned the voice to its proper

While we were sitting in the back of the pigmobile waiting for the trip

that before he decided I looked like a victim...

Speaking of 'investment strategy' I'd like to know who shorted Lockheed
before Trump said that 'thing' about the Lockheed F-35 knocking tens of
billions of dollars of it's share values... for a bit. Trump's cronies
indebted to him and all of their bffs are making bank on the market
volatility created by every stoopid thing Trump says.
You'd figure all the 'truthers' would be on it... Considering they were
all over the airline shorts pre-911 and never bothered to note all those
airlines were in deep financial trouble and people were naturally
shorting and playing those stock's volatility... Unlike Lockheed's
situation... but the 'truthers' got derailed years ago. That's the
problem with conspiracy theory (X) as an analysis of global events.

Let me explain something you seem to be overlooking Shawn. The reason
Trump is even ABLE to purport a rationale for the immigrant ban is
because HILLARY CLINTON facilitated the destruction of Libya, and
attempted to do the same to Syria.
Trump's Executive Order rests on laws and codes that Obama put in place.
If any part of your resistance to Donald Trump involves Democrats, you

Oh but there WAS a reason.
Anyone familiar with the 'underground' of Manhattan or saw what happened
to the Harkins Slough flyway on Highway one north of Watsonville
California during the Loma Prieta Earthquake could explain it to someone
who didn't have 'shit in their ears' and a mind full of shit to match.
The ground underneath it, right next to the slough, liquefied. Shock
does that to mud, and everything in Manhattan below 14th st is mud, and
a honeycomb of subway tunnels, boiler rooms, underground passageways,
and building substructures just as deep as the building are tall, and
the shock wave from the WTC tower hits liquefied the mud, and undermined
the (shoddily constructed) building 7.
It's really that simple. Even a child, or someone STOOPID could
understand it, but truthers are WAY beyond Stoopid... Mental midgets.
And they like it like that. Because if they admitted to themselves that
THEIR VERY WAY OF LIFE was responsible for 9/11, they'd have no way to
cope with the responsibility.
So they make shit up, and stuff it in their ears.

tall is NOT a "theory".
Nor is the reason why the Harkins Slough flyway sank into the mud during
the Loma Prieta Earthquake due to liquification a "Theory". My ex drove
the pickup truck through it (the CHP was too busy to have set up
roadblocks yet) on the way to pick me up after securing the kids and
described the roadbed sitting almost at water level with the support
columns NOT visible and sunk in the mud.
I can't speak for the pancaking of the I-880 flyway in the Bay Area not
knowing the geology of the land under it but you'd think an earthquake
rocking it would toss it sideways. Especially considering the contractor
building it had skimped on the reinforcing rebar. However the top deck
collapsed directly on top of the deck below, killing and wounding a

in real time. Doesn't matter what the poster meant it to prove. The
footage speaks for itself. Only an idiot wouldn't know it was going to
collapse, and as I said you're an idiot so I'll spell it out
It had already internally collapsed which is why the fuel storage tank
IN the building (because the construction was cheapskate like the towers
and the builders didn't want to pay for the permits necessary for an
outdoor tank) fell through a number of floors and burned the fucking
thing out. Until the roof... The thing that keeps torsional forces from
affecting the frame of the building, fell in. That, combined with the
internal structural damage and the undermining off it's substructure,
was the end.
That whole area of downtown Manhattan had to have a few taller buildings
torn down because of the undermining of the building substructures. The
East side of the tip of Manhattan at the time was mostly low-slung
buildings with not so much to damage. You and your idiot friends make it

There's a difference. Idiot.
Reality bites (people making shit up ... on the ass). the fact that the
subterranean structures in MUD under the buildings were undermined by
the shock wave of a 255,000 lb aircraft (max takeoff weight) hitting a
tall building 2/3s (or so) of the way up causing a 'tuning fork' effect
in the ground below, or 'shear stress' for that matter, is reality and
can be verified by the simplest of experiments.
Saying there was a planned controlled demolition because it 'looked
like', is speculative and without substance of fact.

Because resonance is a universal physical principle. I have proved that
(at least) the shock wave of a 255,000 lb 'tuning fork' striking the
buildings nearby caused a resonance in the ground below which is mud
with wood or metal sticks vertically inserted (pilings) and it affected
the building's (the piece of paper or stir stick) stability, and the
building we're discussing, already seriously damaged and unstable from
that shock wave, eventually fell down, sort of like the piece of paper
or stir stick would eventually bump the side of the glass.

Link to web page at bottom
HI all, and hope great things for you in 2017.  Am sharing the link for
a podcast from the John W. Kluge Center at the Library of Congress, an
interview with me about my project on the idea of peace in the Qur'an,
the Muslim scripture.  For those who prefer to read, I am appending the
transcript in this message.
 ================================
JASON STEINHAUER:  Hey there, everyone.  This is Jason Steinhauer from
The John W. Kluge Center at the Library of Congress.  We are podcasting
from inside the Library, Ground Floor of the Thomas Jefferson Building,
and today, we're talking about the idea of peace in the Quran.  And
we're talking today with?  JUAN COLE:  Juan Cole.
MR. STEINHAUER:  —who is the 2016 Kluge Chair in Countries and Cultures
of the South, here at the Kluge Center at the Library of Congress.  He
has been with us for the past 3 months.
So, Juan, I wanted to start really, really basic for our listeners, and
so I am going to ask a very, very simple question to start, which is
simply what is the Quran.
MR. COLE:  The Quran is the Muslim scriptures analogous to the Hebrew
Bible or the New Testament.  It's a repository of what are characterized
by revelations to the Prophet Muhammad, who lived roughly 570 to 632 of
the common era.
MR. STEINHAUER:  Okay.  And can you tell us a little bit about the Quran
itself?  Do we know who wrote it?  Do we know when it was written?  What
do we know about the text itself?
MR. COLE:  Well, Muslims believe that it is revelation from God, so they
believe God wrote it, and however, they believe that it was conveyed to
humankind by the angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad, who lived in
Western Arabia in the late antique period.
MR. STEINHAUER:  So before Muhammad, were there people in that region,
and what did they believe?  Who did they worship, or what did they
worship?  What was the background and context in which Muhammad was living?
MR. COLE:  Right.  Well, the region is called the Hijaz, and it's where
Mecca, the holy city of Islam now is, where millions of people go to
pilgrimage every year.  So that strip of coast along the Red Sea was a
frontier.  It hadn't been entirely incorporated into the Roman Empire,
and it was being encroached on from the South maybe by the Iranian
Empire at the time, the Sassanids, but it was like the Old West.  It was
just the sheriff.  You know, there wasn't any government around, and
there were tribes people there.  There were urban dwellers.  And they
hadn't, for the most part, apparently, adopted any of the great
classical religions of that period.  The Roman Empire, of course, had
become largely Christian by then.  The Iranian Empire was largely
Zoroastrian, but the people in that region adhered to an old pagan
religion of North Arabian gods and goddesses.
MR. STEINHAUER:  So they had multiple deities that they may have worshipped?
MR. COLE:  Yes.
MR. STEINHAUER:  Interesting.  And so Muhammad is born into that
environment, into that society?
MR. COLE:  That's right.  He's born into a prominent clan of Mecca, the
Hashim clan, but there's some thinking from the text of the Quran that
people in that area were under the influence of Judaism and Christianity
and Zoroastrianism, all of which were monotheistic religions, that they
were reshaping their own local religion.  They were shipped a creator
god just called "God," and in Arabic, that's Allah, but it's not a
personal name.  The Christians called "God" by the same word.  It just
means god.
Their thought to have seen him as unlike any of the other deities and
maybe to be in the process of reducing the lesser deities to angels, and
so they weren't quite monotheist, but maybe they were moving in that
MR. STEINHAUER:  Let's talk a little bit about Muhammad.  Who was
Muhammad?  Tell us a little bit about his life, his early years.
MR. COLE:  He was an orphan.  His father died while his mother was
pregnant.  His father had been on a caravan journey up north to Gaza and
died on his way back.  His mother died when the prophet was still a
child, and then he went to stay with his grandfather for a couple
years.  Then his grandfather died, and then he went to stay with his
uncle, Abu Talib.  And it is said that Abu Talib took him on a caravan
journey up to Syria when he was 12, that he later married a wealthy
woman merchant, Khadijah, who was a pillar of the community, very
upright, and she managed these caravan journeys for trade, and that he
impressed her with his mercantile acumen, and that they married.
But then around 610, the traditional stories say that the Prophet
Muhammad began receiving revelations from God through the angel Gabriel.
MR. STEINHAUER:  And so how old would he have been at that time?
MR. COLE:  Forty.
MR. STEINHAUER:  At 40.  So, at 40, he began to see revelations.  So
what was the nature of the revelations, at least what has come down to us?
MR. COLE:  Well, the firmest evidence for them is in the Quran, and
there, there are descriptions of visions of the prophet ascending to
heaven, where he sees the angel at the throne of God.  There is also an
element of prophecy that the last days are coming, the judgment day is
coming, and there's the strong emphasis on the moral life, that people
should not be stingy towards orphans and the poor, that they should
share their wealth a little bit, that they should live moral lives. They should be faithful to their spouses.  They should avoid various
sins and so forth.  So there are these three elements of the visionary,
the apocalyptic, and the moral.
MR. STEINHAUER:  And do these come for the rest of his life?  Do these
come only in a span of a few months or years, or do we know?
MR. COLE:  Well, according to the traditions, they did come for the rest
of his life until he died in 632, and so the Quran is traditionally
thought to be a book that gradually accumulates of these individual
revelations from 610 to 632.
MR. STEINHAUER:  So let's talk a little bit about some of the ideas,
then, that weigh into the Quran and into the sort of spread of this
religion that becomes Islam because, in some of the material you've
shared with me, you talk about how this ascent to heaven, there is sort
of an element of piece and serenity that is sort of endemic to that
revelation or that vision.  Can you talk a little bit about that aspect
of it?
MR. COLE:  Yes.  Well, what I am finding in my research is that peace is
very central to the message of the Quran and of Islam, and, of course,
"peace" as a word means a lot of different things.  There's inner peace
that someone might have.  There's a celestial peace.  There's peace with
nature, and then there is peace within a community and between the
community and others.  So all of those kinds of peace are apparent in
the Quran, but I think the earliest form in which peace is emphasized in
the book has to do with heaven.  So, when you arrive in heaven, the
angels greet you saying, "Peace."
And my research suggests to me that heaven and these apocalyptic works
of the late antique period was thought to have levels like—you know, it
shows up in Dante later, the same thing.
MR. STEINHAUER:  Uh-huh.
MR. COLE:  So I think as far as I can see, the highest level in heaven
is when God addresses you, and only the very righteous get this level,
and God says "Peace" to you.  Then the revelation itself is represented
as peace.  There's a chapter of the Quran that talks about the night
that the revelation first came.  The last verse of it is "And peace it
is until the breaking of dawn."  The peace that it is is the peace of
revelation, of the assurance of God's contact with human beings, his
guidance, and the inner peace that comes from worship and pure prayer. So that heavenly peace is mirrored on earth by the peace of the
believers, and that seems to me to be a complex that follows through the
And then, at some point, the Quran actually gives names to God.  God is
the just, the all-seeing, the omnipotent and so forth.  The names that
it gives him is peace.  God is peace.  So I think this is—the divine,
the heavenly, and then the earthly worship, all—the pinnacle there is peace.
MR. STEINHAUER:  And so is that supposed to teach us that on earth, the
pinnacle of behavior is peace, and if we follow that, we get to the
pinnacle of heaven which is peace?  Is there a correlation there?
MR. COLE:  Yeah.  I think very much so that it's implied that heaven, as
it's described in the Quran, is the ideal society, and so it's being
held up as an ideal for what the best life on earth might look like.
MR. STEINHAUER:  Now, traditionally, I think when we hear the word
"peace" at least in our modern day, we think about wars among people,
wars between nations.  What does the Quran have to say about that?  Is
peace in that sense of the word throughout the revelations as well in
the scriptures?
MR. COLE:  Well, the traditional account of the life of the prophet
falls into two eras.  One is when he begins preaching in his hometown of
Mecca from 610 to 622, and then the second period is when he is forced
out of Mecca by his pagan enemies.  And he and his community have to
relocate to the nearby city of Medina, and he's there until 632.
So, in the Meccan period, in the first period, the Quran seems to me to
recommend almost a kind of pacifism to the Muslims.  There's a verse
that talks about they were humiliated and ridiculed and boycotted, but
the Quran praises those who walk humbly upon the earth, and when they
are ridiculed, they reply to their tormenters, "Peace.  Peace be upon
you," which is a prayer for peace.  So they are turning the other
cheek.  It's almost Christian.
And there are limits to it.  The Quran is not a pacifist document.  I
think nobody would make that argument.  I would say that the Quran's
approach to these matters, it does allow, even in this early Meccan
period, I think, a violence to protect the weak or in self-defense in
the face of highway robbery.  The word that's used is a little obscure. It's that if there's a murder of if there is someone wreaking corruption
in the land, that it's permissible to take up arms.  And remember
there's no government in this part of Arabia.  It's a consensual tribal
system.  So everybody is on their own.  There's no jails.  There's no
authority.  So, if somebody attacks your family, the Quran does permit
you to defend them.
But short of, I'm arguing, something like lethal violence or a very
severe violation of someone's rights, it's recommending peace, even with
the pagan community.  Even with people who believe in multiple gods and
who are actively persecuting the Muslims, the Quran's earliest
recommendations are for the Muslims to face that in a peaceful and
ironic way, and it uses the word "jihad" in this period.  It says—but it
means struggle, not war.
MR. STEINHAUER:  So I want to talk a little bit now about how this
message spreads because you mentioned it in passing about how Muhammad
went on to preach across the region, and at the beginning, of course, I
guess everybody was a nonbeliever, right?  You had to get people on
board with this.  So how does he then take this message out?  And when
he's taking that message out and preaching, is it a message of peace? Is it a message of warning that Dooms Day is coming?  Do we know what
the tone of that message was?
MR. COLE:  Well, the Quran is actually fairly clear on these matters. First of all, the Quran doesn't make a division on the basis of
religion.  It makes a division on the basis of theology.  So people who
believe in one god and who live a moral life are saved, according to
Quran, and this is a very challenging doctrine in this period because
you know the Roman Empire didn't think that way.  They had become very
strong Chalcedonian Christians, and they persecuted people, pagans, who
still tried to perform the old rites to Zeus and Hera and so forth.  And
they even persecuted Christians who didn't accept the Nicene Creed or
didn't accept the Chalcedonian interpretation of Christianity.
So the Quran really has a broad-minded view of these things, but it does
theologically condemn polytheism.  So anybody who dilutes God's
uniqueness and associates other gods with God is doing something wrong
and will go to hell, according to the Quran.  But there's not an
implication in the Mecca period at least that you should, therefore, be
meant to them.  You should preach to them and try to convince them and
save them, but there's not a sense of enmity.  In the Medinan period, Muhammad went to the neighboring city of Yathrib
or Medina.  The Meccans were intent on crushing this new religion, and
they had developed an enmity with Muhammad, and they seemed to have
expelled him from the city.  And Mecca was a sanctuary.  You're not
supposed to kill people there.  So somebody who is living there was kind
of Teflon, but once Muslims were expelled from Mecca, then they could be
killed.  And there were then three wars between the Muslims and the
pagan Meccans, according to the traditional sources, in the Medinan period.
But even then, the Quran says defend yourselves, fight them wherever you
find them if they're attacking you, but if they come to you and sue for
peace, you must make peace with them.  So the ideal is ultimately peace,
but it is allowed that there is such a thing as a just war, and the
Muslims view those wars with Mecca is just wars.
MR. STEINHAUER:  And it strikes me that this is really sort of an
amazing story in our human history that this religion, it starts
relatively late compared to the other two major monotheistic religions,
and it becomes the dominant religion in the region fairly quickly.
MR. COLE:  It's a few decades later.  The Prophet Muhammad died in 632. By the next two or three decades, the Muslims had taken over the
southern third of the old Roman Empire on the other side of the
Mediterranean from Rome and had taken over the old Iranian Sassanid
Empire.  So they very quickly got to the point where Muslim rule
stretched from Southern Spain in the early 700s to the borders of China
beyond Afghanistan.  That was an empire . It made a Muslim ruling class
of conquerors, but most people were Christian, Zoroastrian, Jewish, and
so it was a multicultural—there were even pagan communities, and so it
was a multicultural empire and remained so for hundreds of years.  I
mean, many of these societies, like Egypt, might not have become
majority Muslim until the Medieval period, say the 1200s.
MR. STEINHAUER:  And, of course, those regions are still heavily, if not
predominantly, Muslim today, and you have—in your career, you have both
lived in that region.  You have written extensively about that region. It's interesting that you've done so much research about the current
Middle East, and now you're also going back and looking sort of at the
origins of the story in some way.  Can you talk a little bit about maybe
how the Quran functions today inside Islam and inside the Middle East,
and do these messages of peace—are they still understood to be there, or
have they been sort of shifted or distorted a little bit?
MR. COLE:  Well, as I suggested, it seems to me that one of the great
tragedies of the history of Islam is that the Quran got overruled.  It
got overruled in a number of ways.  One way was that these folk sayings
that were attributed to the Prophet Muhammad gained a kind of canonical
status, and some of them—you know, I don't mean to offend anybody in the
Muslim community, but some of them, quite frankly, obviously contradict
the text of the Quran.  You can't have both of them in many instances,
and so the Quran gets overruled by them.  And most of those sayings come
from a period when Islam had become an empire in its kind of feudal
society, and so they're much more warlike than the Quran text itself
usually is.
And then another thing that happened was that the Muslim clergy
developed a doctrine or a theory of the Quran that later verses abrogate
earlier verses.  So many of the verses that I was talking about of a
peaceful nature are alleged by some of the clergy to have been abrogated
by later verses, which talk about just war and so forth.  So between
being overruled by the sayings and doings of the Hadith and being
overruled by the clergy—and one clergyman said he could find 110 verses
of the Quran that had been abrogated by a later verse and so forth—often
these aspects of the text that I'm interested in are not being
foregrounded in the contemporary community.
And often they'll quote half of a verse or half of a principle.  So the
Quran has a kind of rhetorical convention where it will make a broad
statement, and then it will come back and modify it.  So it will say,
you know, fight the unbelievers wherever you find them or kill them in
war, but then it will say, "But if they sue for peace, then you must
make peace with them."  Well, these fundamentalists leave out the second
part, right?  And so a lot of the discourse of a group like ISIL, which
has taken over part of Syria and Iraq, if you look at the way they
deploy the Quran, it's intellectually dishonest from beginning to end
because it only quotes very selectively.
MR. STEINHAUER:  And you wrote a book recently about new Arabs and
millennials in the Middle East.  I mean, do you get the sense that the
Quran still really resonates with that generation that's not more maybe
tech savvy and more connected globally to what's happening in others
places in the world?
MR. COLE:  Well, actually, a lot of the youth that were prominent in the
2011 youth revolves throughout the region are frankly rather
secular-minded.  Some of them, their parents were Marxists or Arab
nationalists with a socialist bent, and the polling suggests that, in
some countries—this is not universal, but in some countries—Lebanon and
Tunisia standout—there is a very distinct difference in the degree of
religious observance, not necessarily a belief, but of observance
between the older generation and the younger.  In Tunisia, it's a
15-point spread, and in Lebanon, it's more like 50 percent of the
millennial youth don't seem to be very interested in religion.
I think, actually, the rise of ISIL, which happened after my book came
out, has accelerated this trend.  I think a lot of youth are pretty
disgusted by religious fundamentalism.
MR. STEINHAUER:  So, by taking on this project, by trying to go back to
the Quran and find these threads of peace in it, what do you think your
contribution can be?
MR. COLE:  Well, I think that there's been a lot of writing about war
and Islam and war and the Quran.  There are many books about the idea of
jihad or holy war, and I did a literature search for the Quran and
peace.  And I tried lots of different combinations of words and so
forth, and I don't find very many journal articles or books on that
So, again, the Quran is not a pacifist document, and I'm not making that
argument.  But it does have ideas about peace in it and reconciliation
and social harmony and inner peace and spirituality, and it seems to me
odd that we shouldn't also investigate those aspects of the scripture.

Malicious power chargers too!
The internet of things hates you.
Google has shut down a "high-severity" exploit in its Nexus 6 and 6P
phones which gave attackers with USB access the opportunity to take over
the onboard modem during boot-up—allowing them to listen in on
phonecalls, or intercept mobile data packets.
The vulnerability was part of a cluster of security holes found by
security researchers at IBM's X-Force all related to a flaw—tagged
CVE-2016-8467—in the phones' bootmode, which uses malware-infected PCs
and malicious power chargers to access hidden USB interfaces. Patches
were rolled out before the vulnerabilities were made public, in November
for the Nexus 6, and January for the 6P.
The exploit also allowed access to find the phone's "exact GPS
coordinates with detailed satellite information, place phone calls,
steal call information, and access or change nonvolatile items or the
EFS partition."
It was complex to activate, requiring the victim to have Android Debug
Bridge (ADB) enabled on their devices—a debugging mode used by
developers to load APKs onto Android phones—and to have manually
authorised ADB connectivity with the infected PC or charger. However,
according to the researchers, there were significant workarounds.

The people need to change alot before anything changes 'globally'. Given
that people are bombarded by (at least) marketing campaigns for shiny
plastic stuff people are dying making in places they never see, and the
evil underlying semantic of every speck of that brain-bombardment is
"You aren't a good enough human being unless you have [specific and
typically unnecessary shiny plastic stuff]", I don't see any real change
on the horizon. We've been pitted against each other from ethnic hatred
to killing for 'beanie babies'.
Rock promoter Bill Graham was quoted as saying "Lets kill all the
lawyers. Kill them tonight."
But that's because he was selling music and image.
I say "Lets kill all the marketers ('OEM sales engineers' too!). Kill
them tonight."

Darwin is so taken out of context and disabused. For instance he DID
define who 'the fittest' were. Not the strongest or most ruthless. Those
who cooperate the best. admittedly that's a psychopathic strong-point.
Even if they don't have the same goals they're masters of the 'temporary
alliance' (the "B" of the ABCs of psychopathy, no "Bonds"). He also used
the word "Love" a lot. Something that psychopaths don't do so well.

Who among us can give translation of autumn hues to morning news?
The anchorman thrown overboard has simply rooted us in histories

Where is the voice from nowhere, the ones your prophets spoke of?
There are voices from fear disconnected from their diaphragms, dangling
from coffee covered teeth that spill into our laps and scorch our privates
There are voices from the sides of necks, some already noosed, dangling

Dead to themselves, numb to the possibility of truth existing beyond

There are voices of elders, which seem to do no more than damn us to our

So where is that voice from nowhere, that burning bush, that passing dove?
I hear the voices of generals calling for ammunition, presidents calling

Or is that his mighty voice?
Your angry god craving the sacrifice of early generations sons degenerate
Your holy books written in red ink on burning sands
Your prayers between rounds do no more than fasten the fate of your
children to the hammered truth of your trigger
A truth that mushrooms its darkened cloud over the rest of us
So that we too bear witness to the short lived fate of a civilization
that worships a male god
Your weapons are phallic, all of them
That dummy that sits on your lap is no longer a worthwhile spectacle
His shrunken pale face leaves little room for imagination
We have spotted your moving lips and have pinned the voice to its proper

A decade or so ago I was arrested after some skinhead kid at the local

While we were sitting in the back of the pigmobile waiting for the trip
to jail the kid actually had the nerve to say "Please don't file charges
on me! I'm on parole!" I told him he should have fucking thought about
that before he decided I looked like a victim...
He replied: "Awww c'mon White Blood doesn't do that to white blood!"

billions of dollars of it's share values... for a bit. Trump's cronies

You'd figure all the 'truthers' would be on it... Considering they were

airlines were in deep financial trouble and people were naturally
shorting and playing those stock's volatility... Unlike Lockheed's

Let me explain something you seem to be overlooking Shawn. The reason
Trump is even ABLE to purport a rationale for the immigrant ban is
because HILLARY CLINTON facilitated the destruction of Libya, and
attempted to do the same to Syria.
Trump's Executive Order rests on laws and codes that Obama put in place.

are not a resister you're a collaborator.

but it won't get people to stop talking past each other and collaborate
on unified strategies towards social goals.
Because, as seen in corporate environments, which the ejumicational
system indoctrinates us to comply with, collaboration (and cooperation)
REALLY mean "It works for me.", and "what's in it for me?", and as
pavolv's experiments (which Pynchon illustrated so well) showed, it
takes more intense and longer-lasting counter-stimulus to undo the

Aegis: Security Policy in Depth
PDF version
In a recently published piece for the Hoover Institution's Aegis Paper
Series, I argue that the “going dark” debate ought to be considered in
the context of the larger debate over government access to data.
Encryption is not the only game in town: just as law enforcement can
pursue a number of different alternatives to mandating encryption
backdoors, so too can privacy advocates take steps beyond encrypting
their data to ensure their privacy. Acknowledging these substitutes—both
for law enforcement and for privacy seekers—generates a number of
insights. For example, comprehensive reform may make more sense than
serial reforms, since it would allow for issue linkage and deal-making.

Me: That’s not a thing. In a couple days you’ll have absorbed some
arguments from outside your echo chamber, you’ll realize this isn’t the
smoking gun your television told you it is, and you’ll calm down.
Russiagater: Oh my God! You people are impervious to reason! The highest
level of our government has been infiltrated by a hostile nation!
Me: There’s zero proof of that.
Russiagater: What are you talking about? There are piles upon piles of
evidence! You just refuse to look at it because you love tRump

Me: Dude I’ll literally fly to your house and suck your dick right now
if you can prove it to me.
Russiagater: There’s too much smoke for there not to be fire. The
circumstantial evidence is overwhelming. The Trump Jr. thing, the Flynn
thing, the Manafort thing. Look at this graphic of Russian oligarchs
with red lines connected to Trump campaign staffers!
Me: That is not even a tiny bit remotely close to proof.
Russiagater: You’ve got your head in the sand! What will it take for you
to admit you’ve been wrong about this Russia stuff?
Me: Proof. Like, any. After the lies we’ve been told about Iraq, Libya
and Syria in the last few years I’m going to require a whole lot of
proof before I believe anything the US power establishment says about
Russia. Currently there is none. Zero. At all. Not for the Russian
hacking, not for “collusion” with the Russian government to hack the
Democratic party, not for treason, not for any of it. Not one single
part of your narrative is backed by hard, verifiable evidence.
Russiagater: They said that about Watergate. It took years to see Nixon
removed from office!
Me: Watergate began with a real burglary that actually happened. They
ran mug shots of the perps in the paper. Russiagate is comprised
entirely of unsubstantiated claims spoken in authoritative tones by the
same establishment loyalists who told us Saddam had WMDs.
Russiagater: Robert Mueller!
Me: Oh here we go…
Russiagater: It’s an ongoing investigation though! These things take
time. You don’t know they won’t find anything!
Me: See? See how that happened? You entered this conversation making
bold, confident-sounding claims that the White House has been taken over
by the Kremlin, and after a brief back-and-forth you’re mumbling
something about an ongoing investigation that might maybe lead to
something someday. Why did you do that? You guys do that every single
time. You start out loud, confident and assertive, and after a few
exchanges you’re telling me the investigation is ongoing and I don’t
know what they will or will not find. Why not just begin the
conversation with the posture you’re ending it in? Why not wait until
they do find something? Wouldn’t that be infinitely more honest than
beginning the conversation with claims you know you can’t substantiate?
Why are you helping to advance a completely unproven narrative?
Russiagater: So are you an idiot, or a Kremlin bot?
Me: Go away."

@_subject: DefCon attendees will have the opportunity to Hackathon 30 US Digital 
LAS VEGAS – Think of it as a stress test for democracy. Hackers plan to
spend this weekend trying to break into more than 30 voting machines
used in recent elections to see just how far they can get.
U.S. election officials have consistently said that despite Russian
attempts to affect the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, no
votes were tampered with.
Prove it, say organizers of DefCon, an annual hacker convention held in
Las Vegas each July.
The idea is to “start hacking on (the machines) to raise awareness and
find out for ourselves what the deal is. I'm tired of reading
misinformation about voting system security,” Jeff Moss, DefCon founder,
wrote on the conference blog.
One of the event organizers is Matt Blaze, a professor at the University
of Pennsylvania who's been working on making election software more
secure since the mid-2000s. The the best of his knowledge, this will be
the first time a technical crowd will have the ability to look at the
machines “on a large scale.”
That’s in part because until 2015, it was illegal under the terms of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act to try to hack into voting machines.
“The Library of Congress granted an exemption that explicitly allowed
this type of research, to enable good faith research of security flaws,”
said Stephanie Singer a project lead with Free & Fair, a Portland,
Ore.-based election technology company.
The event comes as  attempted election meddling has become a major
geo-political issue both in the United States and worldwide.
This week the Senate grilled the president’s son-in-law and adviser,
Jared Kushner, on possible collusion in Russian attempts to influence
the U.S. presidential election via hacking. (He denied collusion.)
Prior to the 2016 presidential election, hackers probed election works
in at least 39 states, according to a report by Bloomberg last month.
Cyberattacks over the past year in Ukraine, Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany,
France and Austria have attributes that linked them to suspected Russian
hackers, according to former National Intelligence director James
Clapper. They appeared to be aimed at influencing election results,
sowing discord and undermining faith in public institutions that
included government agencies, the media and elected officials.
In all of this, there has been no indication that actual votes were
changed, the FBI has said.  Election officials have cited the
decentralized nature of the U.S. election system, which is state, county
and sometimes even municipality-based.
However, experts in election voting software say no states routinely
perform post-election vote audits to ensure that the reported vote count
tallies with ballots, Singer said.
Moreover, there were no forensic examinations of any of the voting
machines used in the 2016 presidential election, in part because many
election-machine vendor contracts prohibit it, Singer said.
That’s a red flag for hackers at DefCon.
To see just how safe the voting machines that underpin democracy are,
they're bringing more than 30 voting machines purchased on eBay and at
government surplus sales to Las Vegas where they're setting up a “Voting
Machine Hacking Village” at the conference at Caesar's Palace.
There they'll spend the weekend probing the network connecting the
machines, physically attempting to alter the machines and hacking into
their hardware.
The effort is being overseen by two well-known researchers in the field
of election security, Blaze and Harri Hursti, a Finnish computer
programer who in 2005 showed it was possible to hack into a Diebold
voting machine and change vote tallies, a technique now known as “the
Hursti Hack.”
"You never know what that kind of a spark will ignite. My hope is that
we’ll see a broadening of the community of people interesting in
improving the security of our election system,” Blaze said.
The program is just one of a week's worth of computer security
conference events happening in Las Vegas. The first is Black Hat,
followed by DefCon.
Other workshop topics include how to hack a wind farm, defenses against
drones (the French military is training eagles to pluck them out of the
sky), the latest in car hacking and an in-depth look at just how hard it
is to knock out the power grid (hint: not as hard as it should be.)

@_subject: HBO hacked 
HBO has joined the ranks of Hollywood entertainment companies to suffer
a major cyber attack.
EW has learned that upcoming episodes of a couple series and at least
one alleged script or treatment have been put online by hackers who
breached the company’s systems — with more threatened to be coming soon.
“HBO recently experienced a cyber incident, which resulted in the
compromise of proprietary information,” the network confirmed in a
statement. “We immediately began investigating the incident and are
working with law enforcement and outside cybersecurity firms. Data
protection is a top priority at HBO, and we take seriously our
responsibility to protect the data we hold.”
Hackers claimed to have obtained 1.5 terabytes of data from the company.
So far, an upcoming episode of Ballers and Room 104 have apparently been
put online. There is also written material that’s allegedly from next
week’s fourth episode of Game of Thrones. More is promised to be “coming
HBO is not commenting on what content might have been stolen, confirming
specific titles or the amount of data accessed. This morning, HBO
chairman and CEO Richard Plepler sent an email to HBO employees alerting
them of the breach.
“As most of you have probably heard by now, there has been a cyber
incident directed at the company which has resulted in some stolen
proprietary information, including some of our programming,” he wrote.
“Any intrusion of this nature is obviously disruptive, unsettling, and
disturbing for all of us. I can assure you that senior leadership and
our extraordinary technology team, along with outside experts, are
working round the clock to protect our collective interests. The efforts
across multiple departments have been nothing short of herculean. It is
a textbook example of quintessential HBO teamwork. The problem before us
is unfortunately all too familiar in the world we now find ourselves a
part of. As has been the case with any challenge we have ever faced, I
have absolutely no doubt that we will navigate our way through this
On Sunday, an anonymous email was sent to many reporters announcing the
hack: “Hi to all mankind. The greatest leak of cyber space era is
happening. What’s its name? Oh I forget to tell. Its HBO and Game of
Thrones……!!!!!! You are lucky to be the first pioneers to witness and
download the leak. Enjoy it & spread the words. Whoever spreads well, we
will have an interview with him. HBO is falling.”
It’s not clear if the hackers actually have what would be the crown
jewel target for an HBO cyber breach — upcoming episodes of the
company’s biggest hit, Game of Thrones. So far, no GoT episodes have leaked.
In April, a hacker penetrated Netflix to release episodes from season 5
of Orange Is the New Black ahead of its summer return. And in May, a
hacker claimed to have stolen Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No
Tales, but Disney chief Bob Iger later said the threat was a hoax. The
biggest Hollywood hack victim was Sony in 2014, where approximately 100
terabytes of data was uploaded online (versus the 1.5 TB claimed in the
HBO attack).
For years, HBO has fought a cyber-battle to keep Game of Thrones
storylines secret and the show’s content from being illegally
distributed — particularly before episodes air. In season 5, the first
four episodes leaked online before the show’s season premiere after
review DVDs that were sent to the press and industry insiders. HBO has
since halted the practice of sending any episodes in advance. That same
year, some clips leaked ahead of time from overseas HBO distributors,
and even images of Jon Snow’s death found their way online before the
finale aired. Just a couple weeks ago, a Thrones trailer to be screened
at Comic-Con leaked onto YouTube in advance of its release.

living in an atomized society. Herd instinct can get people to do
something in unison to, umn, repressively desublimate (aka 'vent') ...
but it won't get people to stop talking past each other and collaborate
on unified strategies towards social goals.
Because, as seen in corporate environments, which the ejumicational
system indoctrinates us to comply with, collaboration (and cooperation)
REALLY mean "It works for me.", and "what's in it for me?", and as
pavolv's experiments (which Pynchon illustrated so well) showed, it
takes more intense and longer-lasting counter-stimulus to undo the
conditioning. No such thing exists in American society, at least for

Aegis: Security Policy in Depth
PDF version
In a recently published piece for the Hoover Institution's Aegis Paper
Series, I argue that the “going dark” debate ought to be considered in
the context of the larger debate over government access to data.
Encryption is not the only game in town: just as law enforcement can
pursue a number of different alternatives to mandating encryption
backdoors, so too can privacy advocates take steps beyond encrypting
their data to ensure their privacy. Acknowledging these substitutes—both
for law enforcement and for privacy seekers—generates a number of
insights. For example, comprehensive reform may make more sense than
serial reforms, since it would allow for issue linkage and deal-making.

Me: That’s not a thing. In a couple days you’ll have absorbed some
arguments from outside your echo chamber, you’ll realize this isn’t the
smoking gun your television told you it is, and you’ll calm down.
Russiagater: Oh my God! You people are impervious to reason! The highest
level of our government has been infiltrated by a hostile nation!
Me: There’s zero proof of that.
Russiagater: What are you talking about? There are piles upon piles of

Me: Dude I’ll literally fly to your house and suck your dick right now
if you can prove it to me.
Russiagater: There’s too much smoke for there not to be fire. The
circumstantial evidence is overwhelming. The Trump Jr. thing, the Flynn
thing, the Manafort thing. Look at this graphic of Russian oligarchs
with red lines connected to Trump campaign staffers!
Me: That is not even a tiny bit remotely close to proof.
Russiagater: You’ve got your head in the sand! What will it take for you
to admit you’ve been wrong about this Russia stuff?
Me: Proof. Like, any. After the lies we’ve been told about Iraq, Libya
and Syria in the last few years I’m going to require a whole lot of
proof before I believe anything the US power establishment says about
Russia. Currently there is none. Zero. At all. Not for the Russian
hacking, not for “collusion” with the Russian government to hack the
Democratic party, not for treason, not for any of it. Not one single
part of your narrative is backed by hard, verifiable evidence.
Russiagater: They said that about Watergate. It took years to see Nixon
removed from office!
Me: Watergate began with a real burglary that actually happened. They
ran mug shots of the perps in the paper. Russiagate is comprised
entirely of unsubstantiated claims spoken in authoritative tones by the
same establishment loyalists who told us Saddam had WMDs.
Russiagater: Robert Mueller!
Me: Oh here we go…
Russiagater: It’s an ongoing investigation though! These things take
time. You don’t know they won’t find anything!
Me: See? See how that happened? You entered this conversation making
bold, confident-sounding claims that the White House has been taken over
by the Kremlin, and after a brief back-and-forth you’re mumbling
something about an ongoing investigation that might maybe lead to
something someday. Why did you do that? You guys do that every single
time. You start out loud, confident and assertive, and after a few
exchanges you’re telling me the investigation is ongoing and I don’t
know what they will or will not find. Why not just begin the
conversation with the posture you’re ending it in? Why not wait until
they do find something? Wouldn’t that be infinitely more honest than
beginning the conversation with claims you know you can’t substantiate?
Why are you helping to advance a completely unproven narrative?
Russiagater: So are you an idiot, or a Kremlin bot?
Me: Go away."

@_subject: DefCon attendees will have the opportunity to Hackathon 30 US Digital 
LAS VEGAS – Think of it as a stress test for democracy. Hackers plan to
spend this weekend trying to break into more than 30 voting machines
used in recent elections to see just how far they can get.
U.S. election officials have consistently said that despite Russian
attempts to affect the outcome of the 2016 presidential election, no
votes were tampered with.
Prove it, say organizers of DefCon, an annual hacker convention held in
Las Vegas each July.
The idea is to “start hacking on (the machines) to raise awareness and
find out for ourselves what the deal is. I'm tired of reading
misinformation about voting system security,” Jeff Moss, DefCon founder,
wrote on the conference blog.
One of the event organizers is Matt Blaze, a professor at the University
of Pennsylvania who's been working on making election software more
secure since the mid-2000s. The the best of his knowledge, this will be
the first time a technical crowd will have the ability to look at the
machines “on a large scale.”
That’s in part because until 2015, it was illegal under the terms of the
Digital Millennium Copyright Act to try to hack into voting machines.
“The Library of Congress granted an exemption that explicitly allowed
this type of research, to enable good faith research of security flaws,”
said Stephanie Singer a project lead with Free & Fair, a Portland,
Ore.-based election technology company.
The event comes as  attempted election meddling has become a major
geo-political issue both in the United States and worldwide.
This week the Senate grilled the president’s son-in-law and adviser,
Jared Kushner, on possible collusion in Russian attempts to influence
the U.S. presidential election via hacking. (He denied collusion.)
Prior to the 2016 presidential election, hackers probed election works
in at least 39 states, according to a report by Bloomberg last month.
Cyberattacks over the past year in Ukraine, Bulgaria, Estonia, Germany,
France and Austria have attributes that linked them to suspected Russian
hackers, according to former National Intelligence director James
Clapper. They appeared to be aimed at influencing election results,
sowing discord and undermining faith in public institutions that
included government agencies, the media and elected officials.
In all of this, there has been no indication that actual votes were
changed, the FBI has said.  Election officials have cited the
decentralized nature of the U.S. election system, which is state, county
and sometimes even municipality-based.
However, experts in election voting software say no states routinely
perform post-election vote audits to ensure that the reported vote count
tallies with ballots, Singer said.
Moreover, there were no forensic examinations of any of the voting
machines used in the 2016 presidential election, in part because many
election-machine vendor contracts prohibit it, Singer said.
That’s a red flag for hackers at DefCon.
To see just how safe the voting machines that underpin democracy are,
they're bringing more than 30 voting machines purchased on eBay and at
government surplus sales to Las Vegas where they're setting up a “Voting
Machine Hacking Village” at the conference at Caesar's Palace.
There they'll spend the weekend probing the network connecting the
machines, physically attempting to alter the machines and hacking into
their hardware.
The effort is being overseen by two well-known researchers in the field
of election security, Blaze and Harri Hursti, a Finnish computer
programer who in 2005 showed it was possible to hack into a Diebold
voting machine and change vote tallies, a technique now known as “the
Hursti Hack.”
"You never know what that kind of a spark will ignite. My hope is that
we’ll see a broadening of the community of people interesting in
improving the security of our election system,” Blaze said.
The program is just one of a week's worth of computer security
conference events happening in Las Vegas. The first is Black Hat,
followed by DefCon.
Other workshop topics include how to hack a wind farm, defenses against
drones (the French military is training eagles to pluck them out of the
sky), the latest in car hacking and an in-depth look at just how hard it
is to knock out the power grid (hint: not as hard as it should be.)

@_subject: HBO hacked 
HBO has joined the ranks of Hollywood entertainment companies to suffer
a major cyber attack.
EW has learned that upcoming episodes of a couple series and at least
one alleged script or treatment have been put online by hackers who
breached the company’s systems — with more threatened to be coming soon.
“HBO recently experienced a cyber incident, which resulted in the
compromise of proprietary information,” the network confirmed in a
statement. “We immediately began investigating the incident and are
working with law enforcement and outside cybersecurity firms. Data
protection is a top priority at HBO, and we take seriously our
responsibility to protect the data we hold.”
Hackers claimed to have obtained 1.5 terabytes of data from the company.
So far, an upcoming episode of Ballers and Room 104 have apparently been
put online. There is also written material that’s allegedly from next
week’s fourth episode of Game of Thrones. More is promised to be “coming
HBO is not commenting on what content might have been stolen, confirming
specific titles or the amount of data accessed. This morning, HBO
chairman and CEO Richard Plepler sent an email to HBO employees alerting
them of the breach.
“As most of you have probably heard by now, there has been a cyber
incident directed at the company which has resulted in some stolen
proprietary information, including some of our programming,” he wrote.
“Any intrusion of this nature is obviously disruptive, unsettling, and
disturbing for all of us. I can assure you that senior leadership and
our extraordinary technology team, along with outside experts, are
working round the clock to protect our collective interests. The efforts
across multiple departments have been nothing short of herculean. It is
a textbook example of quintessential HBO teamwork. The problem before us
is unfortunately all too familiar in the world we now find ourselves a
part of. As has been the case with any challenge we have ever faced, I
have absolutely no doubt that we will navigate our way through this
On Sunday, an anonymous email was sent to many reporters announcing the
hack: “Hi to all mankind. The greatest leak of cyber space era is
happening. What’s its name? Oh I forget to tell. Its HBO and Game of
Thrones……!!!!!! You are lucky to be the first pioneers to witness and
download the leak. Enjoy it & spread the words. Whoever spreads well, we
will have an interview with him. HBO is falling.”
It’s not clear if the hackers actually have what would be the crown
jewel target for an HBO cyber breach — upcoming episodes of the
company’s biggest hit, Game of Thrones. So far, no GoT episodes have leaked.
In April, a hacker penetrated Netflix to release episodes from season 5
of Orange Is the New Black ahead of its summer return. And in May, a
hacker claimed to have stolen Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No
Tales, but Disney chief Bob Iger later said the threat was a hoax. The
biggest Hollywood hack victim was Sony in 2014, where approximately 100
terabytes of data was uploaded online (versus the 1.5 TB claimed in the
HBO attack).
For years, HBO has fought a cyber-battle to keep Game of Thrones
storylines secret and the show’s content from being illegally
distributed — particularly before episodes air. In season 5, the first
four episodes leaked online before the show’s season premiere after
review DVDs that were sent to the press and industry insiders. HBO has
since halted the practice of sending any episodes in advance. That same
year, some clips leaked ahead of time from overseas HBO distributors,
and even images of Jon Snow’s death found their way online before the
finale aired. Just a couple weeks ago, a Thrones trailer to be screened
at Comic-Con leaked onto YouTube in advance of its release.

@_subject: Phineas Fisher is back... and he b mad! 
A Notorious Hacker Is Trying to Start a ‘Hack Back’ Political Movement
In August of 2014, a hacker shook the cybersecurity world by exposing the secrets of the infamous government surveillance vendor Gamma Group, the makers of the spyware FinFisher.
The hacker jokingly called himself Phineas Fisher, publicizing the hack and taunting the company on Twitter. He also wrote a detailed guide on how he breached Gamma—not to brag, the hacker wrote, but to demystify hacking and "to hopefully inform and inspire you to go out and hack shit."
Then, Phineas Fisher went dark. For almost a year, his public profiles remained silent. Given that he had just upset a company that sold tools to dozens of spy and police all over the world, it seemed like a wise move.
"For politically minded hackers, Phineas is a legend already."
Then, slightly less than a year later, Phineas Fisher came back with a bang. This time, he hacked into the computers of Gamma's competitor Hacking Team, another company mostly known for selling spyware to questionable governments around the world.
"Gamma and [Hacking Team] down, a few more to go :)," he tweeted.
He followed the hack by taunting Hacking Team through the company's own Twitter account, and then, once again, he went dark for months, until he revealed how he got into Hacking Team. Once again, he called others to action. "Hacking is a powerful tool. Let's learn and fight!" he wrote.
On Twitter, he proclaimed on his profile that "our keyboard is our weapon."
Last week, he hit his third victim, the union of the Catalan police Mossos D'Esquadra. Accompanying his new hack, he also released a 39-minute how-to video with anti-police songs playing in the background, in which he showed how he got the data.
While his latest victim seems like a small catch compared to FinFisher and Hacking Team, it's in line with his political views as an "anarchist revolutionary," and with his larger goal of inspiring other hacktivists to "hack back," as he puts it in his guides.
"Everything doesn't have to be big," Phineas Fisher told me in an email. "I wanted to strike a small blow at the system, teach a bit of hacking with the video, and inspire people to take action."
His plan might very well be working. With his rare, targeted, and almost "surgical" strikes, Phineas Fisher has a very good chance of inspiring a new generation of hacktivists and "setting the stage for other hackers to follow in his footsteps," according to Biella Coleman, a professor at McGill University in Montreal who's well-known for her study of hackers, hacktivism, and Anonymous.
"For politically minded hackers, Phineas is a legend already," Coleman told me.
"I don't want to be the lone hacker fighting the system. I want to inspire others to take similar action."
Mustafa Al-Bassam, a security researcher and former LulzSec hacker, agreed, saying that the hacker's "strategy and message bares resemblance to many past Anonymous operations, but he's been arguably more effective at it doing it alone."
Phineas Fisher is "one of the most intelligent hackers I've seen," and "one of the most inspiring to people in the hacktivist community in recent times—possibly of all time," Al-Bassam told me in an online chat.
Coleman said that unlike Anonymous and LulzSec-inspired hackers, Phineas Fisher has been better at choosing targets and justifying his actions with more rounded and sophisticated political and ethical views. For Coleman, the big challenge for the hacker now will be to balance his need not to get caught, with his goal of inspiring others to join his cause.
Phineas Fisher, on his part, seems not to be in a rush, though he's been considerably more active online in the last few weeks.
"Hacking takes time to learn and get good at," he said, revealing that he first got interested in it when he read an article on Anonymous and LulzSec hacker Jeremy Hammond in 2012. In any case, "it's impossible to know yet" whether his call to hack back has been working, and actually, he doesn't really want to start a "formal movement" a la Anonymous or LulzSec.
"But I don't want to be the lone hacker fighting the system," he told me. "I want to inspire others to take similar action, and try to provide the information so they can learn how."

A "smart condom" that "tracks thrust speed and velocity and lets you
share the data." "It's basically a Fitbit for your man bits..."
 The i.Con Smart Condom, which markets itself as the "world's first
smart condom," is actually a ring that fits over a boring, dumb condom
and claims to track the exercise of your man bits, as well as detect
chlamydia and syphilis.
The ring, first announced last July, is currently available for preorder
on British Condoms for £59.99 (about $74, AU$97) with an unknown release
date. But you can't actually put a ring on it yet -- the company says it
won't take your money until the product has a firm release.
In short, the i.Con ring promises to answer every burning question
you've ever had about your sex session. Don't worry, it will pair with
an app for all your data visualization needs.
According to the preorder page, the ring will answer questions such as:
    What's my thrust velocity?
    How fast are my thrusts?
    How many calories did that sesh just burn?
    How many times did I just have sex?
    What's the average skin temperature of my... eggplant?
    What's my girth?
    How many different positions did I just conquer?
Plus, it aims to answer that age-old question: How do I stack up at sex
to everyone else around the world? Because sure, let's gamify sex. What
could go wrong?
The ring, which will come with a one-year warranty, will have a
Micro-USB charging port to provide six to eight hours of "live" usage
(not clear if this means thrust usage or something else). It will work
with a combination of "nano-chip and sensors," and pair with your device
via Bluetooth. (I thought it would charge kinetically, but maybe that's
just a pipe dream.)
With zero pictures of the self-styled "future of wearable technology in
the bedroom" on the site, it's hard to say just how all this technology
will fit into a tiny ring. The company did not immediately respond to a
request for comment. British Condoms does say the i.Con will be
available in one size with a "band adjustment feature."
Worried about privacy, the data kind? British Condoms says "all data
will be kept anonymous, but users will have the option to share their
recent data with friends, or, indeed the world."
Forget dick pics. Now we have to worry about dick status updates.

@_subject: eBook (pdf) Cities Under Siege: The New Military Urbanism - Libcom 
A "Psychogeographical look at the ever increasing encroachment of
militarism and high tech surveillance into urban areas."
"Cities Under Siege comprises three broad, thematic chapters, followed
 by seven extended case studies.
 The first of the thematic chapters looks at how warfare, political
 violence and military and security imaginaries are now re-entering
 cities. This development follows a long period when Western military
 thought was preoccupied with planning globe-straddling nuclear
 exchanges between superpowers or massed tank engagements across rural
 plains. It examines, too, the ways in which the latest military and
 security doctrine is working to colonize the everyday environments of
 modern conurbations.
 Chapter 2 moves on to look at how the various bastions of the
 political right increasingly work to demonize cities as intrinsically
 threatening or problematic places necessitating political violence,
 militarized control, or radical securitization.
 In Chapter 3, I detail the particular characteristics of the new
 military urbanism, and use some of the latest research in the social
 sciences to highlight key features of the deep ening crossover between
 urbanism and militarism.
 The next six case studies address the circuits through which the new
 military urbanism connects urban life in the West to existence on
 colonial frontiers. The first three look at, respectively, the
 proliferation of borders and surveillance systems within the fabric of
 urban life; the US military's ambitions for urban and
 counterinsurgency warfare based on the deployment of armed robots; and
 the connections between entertainment, simulation and US military and
 imperial violence.
 The final three explore the diffusion of Israeli technology and
 doctrine in urban warfare and securitization; the links between urban
 infrastructure and contemporary political violence; and the ways in
 which Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) culture is embedded within a
 geopolitical and political- economic setting that links domestic and
 colonial cities and spaces.

End-to-End Encryption 101 : And do the Vault 7 Revelations Mean
Encryption Is Useless?
By CrimethInc. Ex-Workers Collective -
March 8, 2017
If you’ve used the internet at any point since May 2013, you’ve probably
heard that you should use encrypted communications. Edward Snowden’s
revelation that the National Security Agency logs all of our calls,
texts, and emails sparked a surge in the development and use of
encryption apps and services. Only a few years later, encryption is
widely used for daily communication. If you use any of these encryption
tools, you’ve probably also heard the phrase “end-to-end encryption,” or
“E2EE.” The name seems straightforward enough: end-to-end means content
is encrypted from one endpoint (generally your phone or computer) to
another endpoint (the phone or computer of your message’s intended
recipient). But what level of security does this promise for you, the user?
Since the start of Trump administration, the US Customs and Border
Protection (CBP) has increased its invasion of travelers’ privacy. The
CBP has been demanding that both US citizens and visitors log into their
phones and laptops and hand them over to the CBP for inspection. They’ve
also demanded that travelers provide their passwords or log in their
social media accounts. Travelers who don’t comply face the threat of
being denied entry.
Yesterday, Wikileaks publish a trove of leaked CIA documents including
knowledge of security vulnerabilities and exploits that the CIA paid for
and kept secret from the general public. Now that this information has
leaked, it’s no longer just the CIA that knows these
vulnerabilities—it’s everyone. The New York Times and others misreported
that the CIA had broken the encryption in apps like Signal and WhatsApp,
when in fact what the CIA did was target specific people’s Android
devices and compromise them.
In short, this revelation confirms the importance of using end-to-end
encrypted communications, which hinder state-level actors from
performing broad spectrum dragnet surveillance. E2EE is still important.
Limitations: Plaintext Endpoints
First, it’s important to understand that if you can read a message, it
is plaintext—that is, no longer encrypted. With end-to-end encryption,
the weak links in the security chain become you and your device, and
your recipient and their device. If your recipient can read your
message, anyone with access to their device can also read it. An
undercover cop could read your message over your recipient’s shoulder,
or the police could confiscate your recipient’s device and crack it
open. If there is any risk of either of these unfortunate events taking
place, you should think twice before sending anything you wouldn’t want
to share with the authorities.
This particular limitation is also relevant to the recent “Vault 7”
reveals, which demonstrate how apps like Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegram
may not be useful if an adversary (like the CIA) gains physical access
to your device or your contact’s device and is able to unlock it. Many
reports around Vault 7 have been somewhat misleading, giving the
impression that the apps themselves have been compromised. In this case,
the compromise is at the device level—at the endpoint. The encryption
itself is still good.
Limitations: Targeted Surveillance
Considering that you can’t control the level of security of your
message’s recipient, you should consider the risk that any message you
send them might be read. While rare, there are cases of state powers
targeting people with direct surveillance. In these cases, targets may
be working with malware-infected devices intended to log all of their
incoming and outgoing communications. This compromise functions at the
endpoint level, rendering E2EE useless against these specific
adversaries. Because it is difficult to know whether you (or your
message recipient) are the target of this type of attack, it is always
best to default to not sending overly-sensitive information via digital
communications. Currently, such attacks appear to be rare, but one
should never take risks needlessly.
Limitations: Metadata
The third thing you should know about E2EE is that it doesn’t
necessarily protect your metadata. Depending on how communications are
transmitted, logs may still show the time and size of communication, as
well as the sender and recipient. Logs may also show the location of
both sender and recipient at the time of communication. While this is
not typically enough to land someone in jail on its own, it can be
useful in proving associations between people, establishing proximity to
crime scenes, and tracking communication patterns. All these pieces of
information are useful in establishing larger behavioral patterns in
cases of direct surveillance.
So… Why?
So, if end-to-end encryption doesn’t necessarily protect the content of
your communications, and still gives up useful metadata, what’s the
point of using it?
One of the most important things E2EE does is ensure that your data
never hits someone else’s servers in a readable form. Since end-to-end
encryption starts from the moment you hit “send” and persists until it
hits your recipient’s device, when a company—like Facebook—is subpoenaed
for your logged communications, they do not have any plaintext content
to give up. This puts the authorities in a position in which if they
wish to acquire the content of your communications, they are forced to
spend a significant amount of time and resources attempting to break the
encryption. In the United States, your right to a speedy trial may
render this evidence useless to prosecutors, who may not be able to
decrypt it quickly enough to please a judge.
Mass Surveillance
Another use of E2EE serves is to make dragnet surveillance by the
National Security Agency and other law enforcement agencies much more
difficult. Since there is no point in the middle at which your
unencrypted communications can be grabbed, what is grabbed instead is
the same encrypted blocks of text available by subpoena. Dragnet
surveillance is generally conducted by collecting any available data and
subjecting it to automated sorting rather than individual analysis. The
use of encryption prevents algorithmic sifting for content, thus making
this process much more difficult and generally not worthwhile.
In addition to NSA’s data collection, federal and state law enforcement
agencies around the country have, and frequently use, cell site
simulators known as “IMSI catchers” or “Stingrays.” IMSI catchers
pretend to be cell towers in order to trick your phone into giving up
identifying information, including your location. Cell site simulators
also grab and log your communications. As with other methods of
interception, encryption means that what is retrieved is largely
useless, unless the law enforcement agency is willing to go to the
trouble to decrypt it.
Encryption At Rest
In addition to using end-to-end encryption to protect the content of
your messages while they’re being sent, you can use full-disk encryption
to protect your information while it’s stored on your device. Proper
full-disk encryption means that all of the information on your device is
indecipherable without your encryption key (usually a passphrase),
creating a hardened endpoint which is much more difficult to compromise.
Although encrypting your endpoints is not necessarily protection against
some of the more insidious methods of surveillance, such as malware, it
can prevent adversaries who gain possession of your devices from pulling
any useful data off of them.
End-to-end encryption is by no means a magical shield against
surveillance by nation states or malicious individuals, but Vault 7
highlights how using it can help force a procedural shift from dragnet
surveillance to resource-intensive targeted attacks. When paired with
good sense, encrypted devices, and other security practices, E2EE can be
a powerful tool for significantly reducing your attack surface.
Consistent, habitual use of end-to-end encryption can nullify many
lower-tier threats and may even cause some higher-level adversaries to
decide that attacking you is simply not worth the effort.

McClatchy: Uber’s president joins the  movement, quitting
after six months on the job
October 18, 2013
Sharing Rides, Hoarding Profits
by Darwin Bond-Graham
 “Disruption” is the zeitgeist of Silicon Valley’s tech industry,
especially in the realm of startups. The mythos goes like this: small
scrappy hackers with very little capital and a few computers can create
new business models that will topple older fossilized companies, even
whole industries. In the process the economy will become more efficient
and everyone will have more choices. We all win thanks to the new
Internet-enabled economy. That’s not at all what is happening in
reality, however.
The ideology of disruption goes back a long way in the annals theorizing
capitalism, but the current ideology really owes more to Clayton
Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor and devout Mormon who
has built his academic career on case studies of disruptors.
Christensen’s seminal 1998 article in the Harvard Business Review on
disruption tells a story about dominant companies atop their industries
—Firestone, Xerox, IBM— that were caught flat footed, and in several
cases destroyed, by their smaller creative competitors. They failed to
innovate and grow beyond their core markets. They failed to recognize
the potential of a new technology that would make their existing
products and services obsolete. This has fidelity with the actual
history of American business.
Christensen, along with his son Matthew, manages a hedge fund that
purports to bet on disruptors and short the stock of bumbling giants.
Christensen also sponsors a think tank he named after himself, the
Christensen Institute, which, according to its web site is, “dedicated
to improving the world through disruptive innovation.”
California’s tech entrepreneurs have embraced Christensenian disruption.
The big case studies in tech that seem to confirm Christensen’s theory
are well known. Digital cameras destroyed film. Personal computers
displaced mainframes as the core hardware business, and laptops have
since eaten into a huge share of the personal computer market. Now
mobile devices are eroding PC sales. None was ever seen as a threat to
the existing dominant product and producer, but displacement happened
nonetheless. Tapes replaced vinyl, CDs replaced tapes, but MP3s and
iTunes-like services have replaced CDs. Cloud is displacing both the
idea of storing your data on physical drives you own. Software as a
service is chipping away at the idea of buying and owning software. And
so on…
In a lot of cases disruption ends up being a battle of big corporations
for market share. Consumers and employees within the industry aren’t
necessarily better or worse off when the smoke clears and a winner
emerges with a new technology and business model.
But the tech boom today is characterized by a another kind of
disruption. It’s social disruption. New technologies and business models
don’t just attack the existing dominant corporations; they attack social
relations and transform non-business spheres of life into methodical
instances of economic exchange from which the new tech innovators
extract revenue. The tech boom is also characterized by disruption of
smaller competitive markets by emergent tech monopolists backed
ultimately by huge pools of private equity and giant, monopoly-seeking
The winners and losers in many cases of disruption are split along
existing racial and class lines of inequality. Those with little
economic or political power to defend themselves from the disruptors are
seeing their livelihoods and communities turned upside down. Their small
businesses are being destroyed. Their communities are becoming
unaffordable. Those with cultural capital, and access to economic
capital have a shot at being disruptive, at skimming some wealth off of
deregulated industry and precarious labor. And the wealthy individuals
and companies that should be disrupted by a clever tech startup —the tax
dodging banks, the Fortune 500, the health care companies and insurance
giants— have the resources to defend themselves, fend off the geeks,
deploy an equally clever response to retain market share, or to just
buyout the scrappy competitor and fold it into their existing empire.
The ridesharing phenomenon reflects all of this and more.
Ridesharing companies like Lyft, Uber, and Sidecar use the ubiquitous
ownership of smartphones to connect casual drivers and passenger clients
through their proprietary applications. Like any broker they take their
cut of the revenue in these transactions, (Lyft, for example, skims 20
percent off each payment made by a passenger through their smartphone.)
Ridesharing companies encourage unregulated, hyper-privatized
transactions among precarious laborers. Their business model relies on
marketizing formerly non-economic spheres of life, like giving a friend
a ride in your car, and they have aggressively externalized costs like
gas, insurance, payroll, etc. so that profits are maximized and expenses
are as close as possible to nonexistent. In doing so they undermine the
very existence of the taxi industry, but they also undermine public
infrastructure in toto.
Taxis are not just some private sector dinosaur that should be hit from
an innovation meteor. Taxis are an integral part of every major city’s
transportation infrastructure. Taxis have been strictly regulated to
ensure that the industry’s companies and contractor-drivers pay revenue
into the city for the infrastructure they use: roads, signals, bridges,
signs, sidewalks, etc. In San Francisco taxis generate over ten million
dollars each year in revenue for the city to spend on maintaining
transport infrastructure. The funds also pay for the costs of regulating
the industry through the Taxi Commission. Regulators attempt to shape
the industry in important ways to make it more accessible and equitable
and therefore democratic. For example, San Francisco’s taxi fleet is 85
percent hybrid or CNG fueled, reducing the fleet’s carbon emissions and
improving the health of city residents. This environmental standard is
only possible because the industry is regulated, and ridesharing
companies like Uber and Lyft undermine this effort. Taxis are also
required not to discriminate among passengers, and to serve all parts of
the city, among other things that might not be maximally profitable.
It’s this public transportation infrastructure, a big part of which is
comprised of taxis, that is being disrupted by the ridesharing companies
who have inserted themselves as for-profit brokers in the transportation
The people who will lose the most from the unbridled rise of ridesharing
are those employed by the taxi industry which is seeing profits
disappear. San Francisco’s taxi industry is very decentralized and
highly competitive. There are about 31 cab companies today served by 10
dispatch companies, some quite big and some very small. No single firm
is dominant. There are about 1,500 cabs authorized to drive within the
city. The taxi industry employees several thousand workers. Taxi drivers
are predominantly immigrants and people of color, and the average cabbie
earns a very low yearly income. In 2000 upwards of 57 percent of San
Francisco cab drivers were immigrants, with the largest groups having
arrived from South Asia, East Asia, Russia and Africa. Of the 1,540 taxi
drivers in the San Francisco, San Mateo, Redwood City metro region the
hourly mean wage last year was $14.17, and the annual mean income was a
mere $22,440.
When people say the taxi industry is “ripe for disruption,” what they’re
saying, besides the real inefficiencies and problems affecting most big
city taxi operations, is that it is a decentralized, highly competitive
industry, most of whose owners and operators are low-income people of
color, many of who are immigrants. They are susceptible because they are
marginalized, and because they lack political and economic clout. In San
Francisco the cabbies are definitely a noisy political lobby, but up
against the tech and venture capital bosses and entrepreneurs, who are
most influential in the Mayor’s office, the cab drivers are impotent.
That’s who is being disrupted, a competitive industry that is owned by,
and which employes, working class people of color.
So who’s doing the disrupting? Who benefits from this attack on the taxi
industry, and more generally on the principle of a regulated
transportation sector?
The two biggest ridesharing companies in San Francisco are Uber and
Lyft. Although they virtually didn’t exist until two years ago, between
them they have raised about $390 million over the past 2 years according
to securities filings with the state and SEC. Uber and Lyft are quickly
expanding their ridesharing enterprises to New York, LA, Chicago, and
other cities far beyond the laboratory of San Francisco.
Where is this money coming from?
Uber’s financial backers include Goldman Sachs, Google Ventures, and
four other private equity groups. Perhaps Uber’s biggest financial
backer is TPG Capital. Co-founder of TPG, David Bonderman, one of the
wealthiest men on earth, is now on Uber’s board of directors.
Bonderman’s personal net worth is somewhere in the ballpark of $2.6
billion. TPG reportedly has $55 billion in funds under management making
it one of the largest private equity firms in the world.
Uber’s other investors like Menlo Ventures, Benchmark Capital, and First
Round Capital are pretty typical of Silicon Valley’s private equity
network. The firms are owned and run by mostly white men with Ivy League
college pedigrees, places like Stanford, Cornell, Harvard, Yale and
other bastions of privilege. The partners at these firms are
millionaires, and billionaires are not uncommon. They leverage pension
fund, university endowment, and sovereign wealth dollars to invest in
speculative ventures as well as established companies (and from their
limited partners they extract hefty management fees). To call them
members of the 1% would be inaccurate. Many of Silicon Valley’s private
equity investors quality as bona fide members of the 0.1% due to the
enormous sums of wealth and income at their command. While most are
socially liberal, many of them make political investments with
influential Democratic and Republican members of Congress to ensure the
country’s tax code and business laws allow them maximally build their
Lyft’s financial beneficiaries are similarly elite members of the
economic hierarchy. Earlier this year Zimride, the ridesharing company
that developed Lyft, sold its Zimride ride-sharing application to
Enterprise Holdings for an undisclosed sum. (Zimride was the equivalent
of a combined craigslist ride-sharing bulletin board and Facebook.)
Enterprise Holdings is a giant global corporation that booked $15.4
billion in revenue last year. As a private corporation, Enterprise is
owned and controlled by the Taylor family of St. Louis. Jack Taylor, the
family’s patriarch, is reportedly worth $11 billion. The Enterprise
acquisition of Zimride is an example of how powerful corporate interest
often respond to potential disruptors who might undermine their existing
product; they purchase them and integrate them into their larger
operations. In this case Enterprise, which peddles rental cars it owns,
saw Zimride as something that could disrupt their profit stream, so
Enterprise gobbled up the disruptor. The way Enterprise does business is
changing as a result, but the distribution of economic power isn’t shifting.
Zimride’s Lyft ridesharing product which directly competes with taxi
companies and bigger competitors like Uber received $80 million this
year, mostly from the Andreessen Horowitz private equity firm. Again,
Andreessen Horowitz is about as wealthy and establishment as you can
imagine in American business. Marc Adreesseen, who half the firm is
named for, got rich from developing one of the first web browsers. From
the fortune he obtained doing that he invested in other big tech
companies and became wealthy. Today Andreessen is a director of HP and
Ebay, two Fortune 500 companies, as well as a director of Facebook.
Ben Horowitz (son of the arch-conservative David Horowitz) was a founder
of Opsware, a company Hewlett Packard bought for over a billion dollars
back in 2007. Andreessen was a funder of that company. Opsware was
possibly a disruptor to established tech companies like HP, so HP
devoured it.
Andreessen Horowitz manages probably upwards of $3 billion, and they
have dozens of investments. They’re major backers of other disruptive
tech startups like Airbnb and Udacity, two companies that are similar to
ridesharing in that they are threatening the welfare and livelihoods of
low-income communities.
Look across the other smaller ridesharing startups that are competing
for market share in this gold rush sector and you’ll see similar
stories, fast growing companies with very disruptive business plans
backed by very powerful investors. The people who’s lives will be most
disrupted are going to be the less powerful working class who toil in
the competitive and disorganized taxi and other transit industries. The
public sector will be disrupted as it is partially privatized and as
regulations are undermined in favor of new rules that allow tech
companies to externalize costs as much as possible onto precarious
workers. More and more parts of our lives will be transformed into
relationships of market exchange. As San Francisco’s recent battles over
ridesharing show, this is by no means a “natural” process. It’s
politically determined as to what kind of economy we want, and how the
rules of the economy will distribute wealth and income and provision for
public goods.

YOU live in an altered reality far beyond anyone who pokes smot.
    Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg is the founder, CEO, and owner of
Bloomberg L.P., the financial software, data, and media giant. As
three-term mayor of New York City, he presided over tens of thousands of
small-time pot busts, despite having famously answered a question about
smoking pot with: "You bet I did, and I enjoyed it." NORML used those
remarks as the basis for a full-page ad in the New York Times and ads on
city buses, prompting Bloomberg to say he regretted those remarks, and
that he was "a believer that we should enforce the laws, and I do not
think that decriminalizing marijuana is a good idea."
    Richard Branson. The afore-mentioned Branson not only wants to
invest in marijuana, he says he smokes it with his adult son. In a 2007
interview with GQ, he told Piers Morgan as much, saying father and son
had lit up during an Australian beach vacation. In that same interview,
Branson revealed that he had learned the art of joint-rolling from none
other than Rolling Stone Keith Richards, who should know how it's done.
    Hugh Hefner. The Playboy magazine founder and octogenarian serial
monogamist deserves kudos for being the first businessman to get behind
pot legalization, donating $5,000 to help found NORML in 1970. Hef is
still sticking to that position: “I don’t think there’s any question
that marijuana should be legalized because to not legalize it, we’re
paying the same price we paid for prohibition,” he said in 2010. But it
wasn't just politics; Hefner liked what pot did for him:  “Smoking
helped put me in touch with the realm of the senses,” he told Patrick
Anderson, author of High in America. “I discovered a whole other
dimension to sex.”
    Mark Johnson. Johnson may not be as well-known as some other names
on this list, but he is the CEO and founder of Descartes Labs, a New
Mexico-based tech company, and before that, he was CEO of Zite, a
Silicon Valley personalized news streaming company. Back in his Zite
days, he told Bloomberg News he was a full-on stoner, toking up day in
and day out, and that so many other tech workers were, too, that it was
not an issue. “People just don’t care,” Johnson said. "If you do, you
don’t need to hide it; and if you don’t, you accept that there are
people around you that do.” He also defended marijuana users'
productivity: “Pot is an extremely functional drug,” he said. “Coders
can code on it, writers can write on it.”
    Peter Lewis. Lewis was CEO of Progressive Insurance from the 1960s
to his retirement in 2000, and served as chairman until his death in
2013. He was also "a functioning pot head" who used weed for both fun
and relief from chronic pain from a leg amputation in 1998.
    John Sperling. The University of Phoenix CEO died last year at age
93, but not before publicly acknowledging that he smoked marijuana
manage the side effects of the treatment he received for prostate
cancer. He, Lewis, and George Soros were the original troika of
deep-pocketed marijuana reform businessmen; now only Soros is left,
although Lewis's estate continues to invest in legalization efforts.
    Oprah Winfrey. The iconic Oprah isn't on TV anymore, but she' worth
$3 billion and she's still the chairwoman and CEO of both Harpo
Productions and the Oprah Winfrey Network, where she's also CCO. She has
never staked out a position on marijuana legalization, but she has twice
said she smoked it, although not for a long time. She told "Watch What
Happens: Live" in 2013 that she had last smoked in 1982, and she told

Often straddling a line between journalist and participant, Brown's rise
to prominence tracks that of the hacker collective Anonymous, perhaps

characterized Brown, not always entirely to his liking, as the spokesman
for Anonymous, and it would be his association with hackers that would
later put Brown on the FBI's radar.
For his part, Brown believes that it was his investigation into several
private intelligence contractors following the hack of a firm called HB
Gary. Brown and his team discovered in the emails that several of the
firms had joined together into a conglomerate called Team Themis, and
that one of Team Themis' projects was to develop potential lines of
attack against critical organizations like Wikileaks and journalists
such as Glenn Greenwald.
Brown sat down with Reason TV in the Dallas headquarters of D Magazine,

@_subject: Alex Jones apologizes for his role in promoting "Pizzagate" 
McClatchy passes on WaPo
Alex Jones, the conspiracy-loving media personality, apologized Friday
for his role in promoting "Pizzagate," the baseless viral story that a
Washington pizza restaurant was the locale of a child sex-abuse ring run
by Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman, John Podesta.
In a surprising and rare bit of backtracking, Jones posted a six-minute
video on his website, "InfoWars," in which he read a prepared statement
formally distancing himself and his site from what became a textbook
story of fake news run amok. He addressed his apology to James
Alefantis, the owner of Comet Ping Pong, the restaurant that was the
supposed locale of the alleged conspiracy last year.
"I made comments about Mr. Alefantis that in hindsight I regret, and for
which I apologize to him," Jones said. "We relied on third-party
accounts of alleged activities and conduct at the restaurant. We also
relied on accounts of [two] reporters who are no longer with us."
He added, "To my knowledge today, neither Mr. Alefantis nor his
restaurant Comet Ping Pong, were involved in any human trafficking as
was part of the theories about Pizzagate." The story, he said, "was
based upon what we now believe was an incorrect narrative."
Jones, a staunch supporter of Donald Trump during the presidential
campaign, offered no comment or apology to Clinton or Podesta for
outlandish statements about their alleged involvement in the abuse of
hundreds of children.
Jones didn't say what prompted his apology but it may have been
motivated by a letter Alefantis wrote to him in February. The letter
demands an apology and retraction for InfoWars' postings about
Pizzagate; it does not threaten legal action, but refers to what
Alefantis describes as "defaming" comments by InfoWars.
But the timing of Jones' apology suggests he was concerned about a
potential lawsuit. Under Texas law, the Austin-based Jones had to
retract or apologize for the stories by Friday - one full month after
receiving Alefantis' letter - to avoid exposing InfoWars to punitive
damages in a libel suit.
In a statement, Alefantis said, "I am pleased that Mr. Jones has
apologized and admitted that he and his employees repeatedly spread
falsehoods about me and my restaurant. I wish that he would have made
this admission and apology months ago. And his apology, while welcome,
does nothing to address the harm he and his company have done to me, my
business, and my community."
Alefantis' spokeswoman, Molly Levinson, said Friday that Alefantis and
his attorney "continue to evaluate our legal claims."
As the story spread, Alefantis and his employees received multiple death
threats. The rumors culminated in December when a North Carolina man,
Edgar Madisson Welch, came to the restaurant with a loaded assault rifle
and handgun in what he called an attempt to investigate the claims. He
fired the rifle several times while inside the restaurant, according to
court documents.
Welch coincidentally pleaded guilty on Friday to weapons and assault
charges in an agreement with federal prosecutors in the District.
InfoWars wasn't the principal progenitor of the false story. The story
spread primarily through such user-generated sites as Reddit and 4chan,
as well as through fake-news websites and social media.
But InfoWars played a role, publishing numerous articles and
commentaries that speculated about the alleged involvement of Clinton
and Podesta. Pizzagate was sparked by cryptic comments made by Podesta
in emails that were stolen and later released by WikiLeaks during the
Among the more damaging elements cited by Alefantis in his Feb. 22
letter was InfoWars' role in encouraging its followers "to go out and
investigate the 'Pizzagate' conspiracy theory, to come to my restaurant
and investigate lies."
In his statement, Alefantis noted, "We can all hope that Mr. Jones'
retreat is the beginning of a process to hold accountable the people who
motivated an armed gunman to travel across state lines and fire his
weapon in a family-friendly restaurant."

After all, that's so much simpler than refusing to be Airstrip One for

UK: Attacker used WhatsApp, firm must help police get access
Mar. 26, 2017 | 05:28 PM
Associated Press via Lebanon Daily Star
LONDON: Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood sent a WhatsApp
message that cannot be accessed because it was encrypted by the popular
messaging service, a top British security official said Sunday.
British press reports suggest Masood used the easily available messaging
service just minutes before starting a rampage Wednesday that left three
pedestrians and one police officer dead and dozens more wounded,
including some with catastrophic injuries.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd used appearances on BBC and Sky News to urge
WhatsApp and other encrypted services to make their platforms accessible
to intelligence services and police trying to carrying out lawful
"We need to make sure that organizations like WhatsApp - and there are
plenty of others like that - don't provide a secret place for terrorists
to communicate with each other," she said.
Rudd did not provide any details about Masood's use of WhatsApp, saying
only "this terrorist sent a WhatsApp message and it can't be accessed."
But her call for a "back door" system to allow authorities to access
information is likely to be met with resistance throughout the industry.
In the United States, Apple fought the FBI's request for the passcodes
needed to unlock an iPhone that had been used by one of the perpetrators
in the 2015 extremist attack on San Bernardino, California.
Masood drove a rented SUV into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before
smashing it into Parliament's gates and rushing onto the grounds, where
he stabbed a policeman to death before he was shot dead. A detailed
police reconstruction has found the entire attack lasted 82 seconds.
Police say he acted alone but they are trying to pinpoint his motive and
identify any possible accomplices, making the WhatsApp message a
potential clue to his state of mind and his social media contacts.
Rudd said attacks like Masood's would be easier to prevent if
authorities could penetrate encrypted services after obtaining a warrant
similar to the ones used to listen in on telephone calls or - in snail
mail days - steam open letters and read their contents.
Without a change in the system, she said terrorists would be able to
communicate with each other without fear of being overheard even in
cases where a legal warrant has been obtained.
Rudd also urged technology companies to do a better job at preventing
the publication of material that promotes extremism. She plans to meet
with firms Thursday in a bid to set up an industry board that would take
steps to make the web less useful to extremists.
British police investigating the attack say they still believe Masood, a
52-year-old Briton, acted alone and say they have no indications that
further attacks are planned.
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said it may never be possible to
fully determine Masood's motives.
"That understanding may have died with him," Basu said Saturday night as
police appealed for people who knew Masood or saw him to contact
investigators. "Even if he acted alone in the preparation, we need to
establish with absolute clarity why he did these unspeakable acts, to
bring reassurance to Londoners."
ISIS, which is losing territory in Iraq and Syria but still has radical
followers in other parts of the world, has claimed Masood was a
"soldier" carrying out its wishes to attack Western countries.
Masood had convictions for violent crimes in the U.K. and spent time in
prison. He also worked in Saudi Arabia teaching English for two years
and traveled there again in 2015 on a visa designed for religious
One 58-year-old man remains in custody in the case after being arrested
in Birmingham, where Masood had been living. He has not been charged or
named. Nine others arrested after the assault have been freed without
charges and one has been freed on bail.
The family of slain police officer Keith Palmer, meanwhile, released a
statement thanking those who tried to save his life.
"There was nothing more you could have done. You did your best and we
are just grateful he was not alone," the statement said.

    How fast are my thrusts?
    How many calories did that sesh just burn?
    How many times did I just have sex?
    What's the average skin temperature of my... eggplant?
    What's my girth?
    How many different positions did I just conquer?
Plus, it aims to answer that age-old question: How do I stack up at sex
to everyone else around the world? Because sure, let's gamify sex. What
could go wrong?
The ring, which will come with a one-year warranty, will have a
Micro-USB charging port to provide six to eight hours of "live" usage
(not clear if this means thrust usage or something else). It will work
with a combination of "nano-chip and sensors," and pair with your device
via Bluetooth. (I thought it would charge kinetically, but maybe that's
just a pipe dream.)
With zero pictures of the self-styled "future of wearable technology in
the bedroom" on the site, it's hard to say just how all this technology
will fit into a tiny ring. The company did not immediately respond to a
request for comment. British Condoms does say the i.Con will be
available in one size with a "band adjustment feature."
Worried about privacy, the data kind? British Condoms says "all data
will be kept anonymous, but users will have the option to share their
recent data with friends, or, indeed the world."
Forget dick pics. Now we have to worry about dick status updates.

A "Psychogeographical look at the ever increasing encroachment of
militarism and high tech surveillance into urban areas."
"Cities Under Siege comprises three broad, thematic chapters, followed
 by seven extended case studies.
 The first of the thematic chapters looks at how warfare, political
 violence and military and security imaginaries are now re-entering
 cities. This development follows a long period when Western military
 thought was preoccupied with planning globe-straddling nuclear
 exchanges between superpowers or massed tank engagements across rural
 plains. It examines, too, the ways in which the latest military and
 security doctrine is working to colonize the everyday environments of
 modern conurbations.
 Chapter 2 moves on to look at how the various bastions of the
 political right increasingly work to demonize cities as intrinsically
 threatening or problematic places necessitating political violence,
 militarized control, or radical securitization.
 In Chapter 3, I detail the particular characteristics of the new
 military urbanism, and use some of the latest research in the social
 sciences to highlight key features of the deep ening crossover between
 urbanism and militarism.
 The next six case studies address the circuits through which the new
 military urbanism connects urban life in the West to existence on
 colonial frontiers. The first three look at, respectively, the
 proliferation of borders and surveillance systems within the fabric of
 urban life; the US military's ambitions for urban and
 counterinsurgency warfare based on the deployment of armed robots; and
 the connections between entertainment, simulation and US military and
 imperial violence.
 The final three explore the diffusion of Israeli technology and
 doctrine in urban warfare and securitization; the links between urban
 infrastructure and contemporary political violence; and the ways in
 which Sports Utility Vehicle (SUV) culture is embedded within a
 geopolitical and political- economic setting that links domestic and
 colonial cities and spaces.

End-to-End Encryption 101 : And do the Vault 7 Revelations Mean
Encryption Is Useless?
By CrimethInc. Ex-Workers Collective -
March 8, 2017
If you’ve used the internet at any point since May 2013, you’ve probably
heard that you should use encrypted communications. Edward Snowden’s
revelation that the National Security Agency logs all of our calls,
texts, and emails sparked a surge in the development and use of
encryption apps and services. Only a few years later, encryption is
widely used for daily communication. If you use any of these encryption
tools, you’ve probably also heard the phrase “end-to-end encryption,” or
“E2EE.” The name seems straightforward enough: end-to-end means content
is encrypted from one endpoint (generally your phone or computer) to
another endpoint (the phone or computer of your message’s intended
recipient). But what level of security does this promise for you, the user?
Since the start of Trump administration, the US Customs and Border
Protection (CBP) has increased its invasion of travelers’ privacy. The
CBP has been demanding that both US citizens and visitors log into their
phones and laptops and hand them over to the CBP for inspection. They’ve
also demanded that travelers provide their passwords or log in their
social media accounts. Travelers who don’t comply face the threat of
being denied entry.
Yesterday, Wikileaks publish a trove of leaked CIA documents including
knowledge of security vulnerabilities and exploits that the CIA paid for
and kept secret from the general public. Now that this information has
leaked, it’s no longer just the CIA that knows these
vulnerabilities—it’s everyone. The New York Times and others misreported
that the CIA had broken the encryption in apps like Signal and WhatsApp,
when in fact what the CIA did was target specific people’s Android
devices and compromise them.
In short, this revelation confirms the importance of using end-to-end
encrypted communications, which hinder state-level actors from
performing broad spectrum dragnet surveillance. E2EE is still important.
Limitations: Plaintext Endpoints
First, it’s important to understand that if you can read a message, it
is plaintext—that is, no longer encrypted. With end-to-end encryption,
the weak links in the security chain become you and your device, and
your recipient and their device. If your recipient can read your
message, anyone with access to their device can also read it. An
undercover cop could read your message over your recipient’s shoulder,
or the police could confiscate your recipient’s device and crack it
open. If there is any risk of either of these unfortunate events taking
place, you should think twice before sending anything you wouldn’t want
to share with the authorities.
This particular limitation is also relevant to the recent “Vault 7”
reveals, which demonstrate how apps like Signal, WhatsApp, and Telegram
may not be useful if an adversary (like the CIA) gains physical access
to your device or your contact’s device and is able to unlock it. Many
reports around Vault 7 have been somewhat misleading, giving the
impression that the apps themselves have been compromised. In this case,
the compromise is at the device level—at the endpoint. The encryption
itself is still good.
Limitations: Targeted Surveillance
Considering that you can’t control the level of security of your
message’s recipient, you should consider the risk that any message you
send them might be read. While rare, there are cases of state powers
targeting people with direct surveillance. In these cases, targets may
be working with malware-infected devices intended to log all of their
incoming and outgoing communications. This compromise functions at the
endpoint level, rendering E2EE useless against these specific
adversaries. Because it is difficult to know whether you (or your
message recipient) are the target of this type of attack, it is always
best to default to not sending overly-sensitive information via digital
communications. Currently, such attacks appear to be rare, but one
should never take risks needlessly.
Limitations: Metadata
The third thing you should know about E2EE is that it doesn’t
necessarily protect your metadata. Depending on how communications are
transmitted, logs may still show the time and size of communication, as
well as the sender and recipient. Logs may also show the location of
both sender and recipient at the time of communication. While this is
not typically enough to land someone in jail on its own, it can be
useful in proving associations between people, establishing proximity to
crime scenes, and tracking communication patterns. All these pieces of
information are useful in establishing larger behavioral patterns in
cases of direct surveillance.
So… Why?
So, if end-to-end encryption doesn’t necessarily protect the content of
your communications, and still gives up useful metadata, what’s the
point of using it?
One of the most important things E2EE does is ensure that your data
never hits someone else’s servers in a readable form. Since end-to-end
encryption starts from the moment you hit “send” and persists until it
hits your recipient’s device, when a company—like Facebook—is subpoenaed
for your logged communications, they do not have any plaintext content
to give up. This puts the authorities in a position in which if they
wish to acquire the content of your communications, they are forced to
spend a significant amount of time and resources attempting to break the
encryption. In the United States, your right to a speedy trial may
render this evidence useless to prosecutors, who may not be able to
decrypt it quickly enough to please a judge.
Mass Surveillance
Another use of E2EE serves is to make dragnet surveillance by the
National Security Agency and other law enforcement agencies much more
difficult. Since there is no point in the middle at which your
unencrypted communications can be grabbed, what is grabbed instead is
the same encrypted blocks of text available by subpoena. Dragnet
surveillance is generally conducted by collecting any available data and
subjecting it to automated sorting rather than individual analysis. The
use of encryption prevents algorithmic sifting for content, thus making
this process much more difficult and generally not worthwhile.
In addition to NSA’s data collection, federal and state law enforcement
agencies around the country have, and frequently use, cell site
simulators known as “IMSI catchers” or “Stingrays.” IMSI catchers
pretend to be cell towers in order to trick your phone into giving up
identifying information, including your location. Cell site simulators
also grab and log your communications. As with other methods of
interception, encryption means that what is retrieved is largely
useless, unless the law enforcement agency is willing to go to the
trouble to decrypt it.
Encryption At Rest
In addition to using end-to-end encryption to protect the content of
your messages while they’re being sent, you can use full-disk encryption
to protect your information while it’s stored on your device. Proper
full-disk encryption means that all of the information on your device is
indecipherable without your encryption key (usually a passphrase),
creating a hardened endpoint which is much more difficult to compromise.
Although encrypting your endpoints is not necessarily protection against
some of the more insidious methods of surveillance, such as malware, it
can prevent adversaries who gain possession of your devices from pulling
any useful data off of them.
End-to-end encryption is by no means a magical shield against
surveillance by nation states or malicious individuals, but Vault 7
highlights how using it can help force a procedural shift from dragnet
surveillance to resource-intensive targeted attacks. When paired with
good sense, encrypted devices, and other security practices, E2EE can be
a powerful tool for significantly reducing your attack surface.
Consistent, habitual use of end-to-end encryption can nullify many
lower-tier threats and may even cause some higher-level adversaries to
decide that attacking you is simply not worth the effort.

McClatchy: Uber’s president joins the  movement, quitting
after six months on the job
October 18, 2013
Sharing Rides, Hoarding Profits
by Darwin Bond-Graham
 “Disruption” is the zeitgeist of Silicon Valley’s tech industry,
especially in the realm of startups. The mythos goes like this: small
scrappy hackers with very little capital and a few computers can create
new business models that will topple older fossilized companies, even
whole industries. In the process the economy will become more efficient
and everyone will have more choices. We all win thanks to the new
Internet-enabled economy. That’s not at all what is happening in
reality, however.
The ideology of disruption goes back a long way in the annals theorizing
capitalism, but the current ideology really owes more to Clayton
Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor and devout Mormon who
has built his academic career on case studies of disruptors.
Christensen’s seminal 1998 article in the Harvard Business Review on
disruption tells a story about dominant companies atop their industries
—Firestone, Xerox, IBM— that were caught flat footed, and in several
cases destroyed, by their smaller creative competitors. They failed to
innovate and grow beyond their core markets. They failed to recognize
the potential of a new technology that would make their existing
products and services obsolete. This has fidelity with the actual
history of American business.
Christensen, along with his son Matthew, manages a hedge fund that
purports to bet on disruptors and short the stock of bumbling giants.
Christensen also sponsors a think tank he named after himself, the
Christensen Institute, which, according to its web site is, “dedicated
to improving the world through disruptive innovation.”
California’s tech entrepreneurs have embraced Christensenian disruption.
The big case studies in tech that seem to confirm Christensen’s theory
are well known. Digital cameras destroyed film. Personal computers
displaced mainframes as the core hardware business, and laptops have
since eaten into a huge share of the personal computer market. Now
mobile devices are eroding PC sales. None was ever seen as a threat to
the existing dominant product and producer, but displacement happened
nonetheless. Tapes replaced vinyl, CDs replaced tapes, but MP3s and
iTunes-like services have replaced CDs. Cloud is displacing both the
idea of storing your data on physical drives you own. Software as a
service is chipping away at the idea of buying and owning software. And
so on…
In a lot of cases disruption ends up being a battle of big corporations
for market share. Consumers and employees within the industry aren’t
necessarily better or worse off when the smoke clears and a winner
emerges with a new technology and business model.
But the tech boom today is characterized by a another kind of
disruption. It’s social disruption. New technologies and business models
don’t just attack the existing dominant corporations; they attack social
relations and transform non-business spheres of life into methodical
instances of economic exchange from which the new tech innovators
extract revenue. The tech boom is also characterized by disruption of
smaller competitive markets by emergent tech monopolists backed
ultimately by huge pools of private equity and giant, monopoly-seeking
The winners and losers in many cases of disruption are split along
existing racial and class lines of inequality. Those with little
economic or political power to defend themselves from the disruptors are
seeing their livelihoods and communities turned upside down. Their small
businesses are being destroyed. Their communities are becoming
unaffordable. Those with cultural capital, and access to economic
capital have a shot at being disruptive, at skimming some wealth off of
deregulated industry and precarious labor. And the wealthy individuals
and companies that should be disrupted by a clever tech startup —the tax
dodging banks, the Fortune 500, the health care companies and insurance
giants— have the resources to defend themselves, fend off the geeks,
deploy an equally clever response to retain market share, or to just
buyout the scrappy competitor and fold it into their existing empire.
The ridesharing phenomenon reflects all of this and more.
Ridesharing companies like Lyft, Uber, and Sidecar use the ubiquitous
ownership of smartphones to connect casual drivers and passenger clients
through their proprietary applications. Like any broker they take their
cut of the revenue in these transactions, (Lyft, for example, skims 20
percent off each payment made by a passenger through their smartphone.)
Ridesharing companies encourage unregulated, hyper-privatized
transactions among precarious laborers. Their business model relies on
marketizing formerly non-economic spheres of life, like giving a friend
a ride in your car, and they have aggressively externalized costs like
gas, insurance, payroll, etc. so that profits are maximized and expenses
are as close as possible to nonexistent. In doing so they undermine the
very existence of the taxi industry, but they also undermine public
infrastructure in toto.
Taxis are not just some private sector dinosaur that should be hit from
an innovation meteor. Taxis are an integral part of every major city’s
transportation infrastructure. Taxis have been strictly regulated to
ensure that the industry’s companies and contractor-drivers pay revenue
into the city for the infrastructure they use: roads, signals, bridges,
signs, sidewalks, etc. In San Francisco taxis generate over ten million
dollars each year in revenue for the city to spend on maintaining
transport infrastructure. The funds also pay for the costs of regulating
the industry through the Taxi Commission. Regulators attempt to shape
the industry in important ways to make it more accessible and equitable
and therefore democratic. For example, San Francisco’s taxi fleet is 85
percent hybrid or CNG fueled, reducing the fleet’s carbon emissions and
improving the health of city residents. This environmental standard is
only possible because the industry is regulated, and ridesharing
companies like Uber and Lyft undermine this effort. Taxis are also
required not to discriminate among passengers, and to serve all parts of
the city, among other things that might not be maximally profitable.
It’s this public transportation infrastructure, a big part of which is
comprised of taxis, that is being disrupted by the ridesharing companies
who have inserted themselves as for-profit brokers in the transportation
The people who will lose the most from the unbridled rise of ridesharing
are those employed by the taxi industry which is seeing profits
disappear. San Francisco’s taxi industry is very decentralized and
highly competitive. There are about 31 cab companies today served by 10
dispatch companies, some quite big and some very small. No single firm
is dominant. There are about 1,500 cabs authorized to drive within the
city. The taxi industry employees several thousand workers. Taxi drivers
are predominantly immigrants and people of color, and the average cabbie
earns a very low yearly income. In 2000 upwards of 57 percent of San
Francisco cab drivers were immigrants, with the largest groups having
arrived from South Asia, East Asia, Russia and Africa. Of the 1,540 taxi
drivers in the San Francisco, San Mateo, Redwood City metro region the
hourly mean wage last year was $14.17, and the annual mean income was a
mere $22,440.
When people say the taxi industry is “ripe for disruption,” what they’re
saying, besides the real inefficiencies and problems affecting most big
city taxi operations, is that it is a decentralized, highly competitive
industry, most of whose owners and operators are low-income people of
color, many of who are immigrants. They are susceptible because they are
marginalized, and because they lack political and economic clout. In San
Francisco the cabbies are definitely a noisy political lobby, but up
against the tech and venture capital bosses and entrepreneurs, who are
most influential in the Mayor’s office, the cab drivers are impotent.
That’s who is being disrupted, a competitive industry that is owned by,
and which employes, working class people of color.
So who’s doing the disrupting? Who benefits from this attack on the taxi
industry, and more generally on the principle of a regulated
transportation sector?
The two biggest ridesharing companies in San Francisco are Uber and
Lyft. Although they virtually didn’t exist until two years ago, between
them they have raised about $390 million over the past 2 years according
to securities filings with the state and SEC. Uber and Lyft are quickly
expanding their ridesharing enterprises to New York, LA, Chicago, and
other cities far beyond the laboratory of San Francisco.
Where is this money coming from?
Uber’s financial backers include Goldman Sachs, Google Ventures, and
four other private equity groups. Perhaps Uber’s biggest financial
backer is TPG Capital. Co-founder of TPG, David Bonderman, one of the
wealthiest men on earth, is now on Uber’s board of directors.
Bonderman’s personal net worth is somewhere in the ballpark of $2.6
billion. TPG reportedly has $55 billion in funds under management making
it one of the largest private equity firms in the world.
Uber’s other investors like Menlo Ventures, Benchmark Capital, and First
Round Capital are pretty typical of Silicon Valley’s private equity
network. The firms are owned and run by mostly white men with Ivy League
college pedigrees, places like Stanford, Cornell, Harvard, Yale and
other bastions of privilege. The partners at these firms are
millionaires, and billionaires are not uncommon. They leverage pension
fund, university endowment, and sovereign wealth dollars to invest in
speculative ventures as well as established companies (and from their
limited partners they extract hefty management fees). To call them
members of the 1% would be inaccurate. Many of Silicon Valley’s private
equity investors quality as bona fide members of the 0.1% due to the
enormous sums of wealth and income at their command. While most are
socially liberal, many of them make political investments with
influential Democratic and Republican members of Congress to ensure the
country’s tax code and business laws allow them maximally build their
Lyft’s financial beneficiaries are similarly elite members of the
economic hierarchy. Earlier this year Zimride, the ridesharing company
that developed Lyft, sold its Zimride ride-sharing application to
Enterprise Holdings for an undisclosed sum. (Zimride was the equivalent
of a combined craigslist ride-sharing bulletin board and Facebook.)
Enterprise Holdings is a giant global corporation that booked $15.4
billion in revenue last year. As a private corporation, Enterprise is
owned and controlled by the Taylor family of St. Louis. Jack Taylor, the
family’s patriarch, is reportedly worth $11 billion. The Enterprise
acquisition of Zimride is an example of how powerful corporate interest
often respond to potential disruptors who might undermine their existing
product; they purchase them and integrate them into their larger
operations. In this case Enterprise, which peddles rental cars it owns,
saw Zimride as something that could disrupt their profit stream, so
Enterprise gobbled up the disruptor. The way Enterprise does business is
changing as a result, but the distribution of economic power isn’t shifting.
Zimride’s Lyft ridesharing product which directly competes with taxi
companies and bigger competitors like Uber received $80 million this
year, mostly from the Andreessen Horowitz private equity firm. Again,
Andreessen Horowitz is about as wealthy and establishment as you can
imagine in American business. Marc Adreesseen, who half the firm is
named for, got rich from developing one of the first web browsers. From
the fortune he obtained doing that he invested in other big tech
companies and became wealthy. Today Andreessen is a director of HP and
Ebay, two Fortune 500 companies, as well as a director of Facebook.
Ben Horowitz (son of the arch-conservative David Horowitz) was a founder
of Opsware, a company Hewlett Packard bought for over a billion dollars
back in 2007. Andreessen was a funder of that company. Opsware was
possibly a disruptor to established tech companies like HP, so HP
devoured it.
Andreessen Horowitz manages probably upwards of $3 billion, and they
have dozens of investments. They’re major backers of other disruptive
tech startups like Airbnb and Udacity, two companies that are similar to
ridesharing in that they are threatening the welfare and livelihoods of
low-income communities.
Look across the other smaller ridesharing startups that are competing
for market share in this gold rush sector and you’ll see similar
stories, fast growing companies with very disruptive business plans
backed by very powerful investors. The people who’s lives will be most
disrupted are going to be the less powerful working class who toil in
the competitive and disorganized taxi and other transit industries. The
public sector will be disrupted as it is partially privatized and as
regulations are undermined in favor of new rules that allow tech
companies to externalize costs as much as possible onto precarious
workers. More and more parts of our lives will be transformed into
relationships of market exchange. As San Francisco’s recent battles over
ridesharing show, this is by no means a “natural” process. It’s
politically determined as to what kind of economy we want, and how the
rules of the economy will distribute wealth and income and provision for
public goods.

Because anything worth saying to me offlist is worth putting on the
list, ESPECIALLY when it's trollbait.
YOU live in an altered reality far beyond anyone who pokes smot.
    Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg is the founder, CEO, and owner of
Bloomberg L.P., the financial software, data, and media giant. As
three-term mayor of New York City, he presided over tens of thousands of
small-time pot busts, despite having famously answered a question about
smoking pot with: "You bet I did, and I enjoyed it." NORML used those
remarks as the basis for a full-page ad in the New York Times and ads on
city buses, prompting Bloomberg to say he regretted those remarks, and
that he was "a believer that we should enforce the laws, and I do not
think that decriminalizing marijuana is a good idea."
    Richard Branson. The afore-mentioned Branson not only wants to
invest in marijuana, he says he smokes it with his adult son. In a 2007
interview with GQ, he told Piers Morgan as much, saying father and son
had lit up during an Australian beach vacation. In that same interview,
Branson revealed that he had learned the art of joint-rolling from none
other than Rolling Stone Keith Richards, who should know how it's done.
    Hugh Hefner. The Playboy magazine founder and octogenarian serial
monogamist deserves kudos for being the first businessman to get behind
pot legalization, donating $5,000 to help found NORML in 1970. Hef is
still sticking to that position: “I don’t think there’s any question
that marijuana should be legalized because to not legalize it, we’re
paying the same price we paid for prohibition,” he said in 2010. But it
wasn't just politics; Hefner liked what pot did for him:  “Smoking
helped put me in touch with the realm of the senses,” he told Patrick
Anderson, author of High in America. “I discovered a whole other
dimension to sex.”
    Mark Johnson. Johnson may not be as well-known as some other names
on this list, but he is the CEO and founder of Descartes Labs, a New
Mexico-based tech company, and before that, he was CEO of Zite, a
Silicon Valley personalized news streaming company. Back in his Zite
days, he told Bloomberg News he was a full-on stoner, toking up day in
and day out, and that so many other tech workers were, too, that it was
not an issue. “People just don’t care,” Johnson said. "If you do, you
don’t need to hide it; and if you don’t, you accept that there are
people around you that do.” He also defended marijuana users'
productivity: “Pot is an extremely functional drug,” he said. “Coders
can code on it, writers can write on it.”
    Peter Lewis. Lewis was CEO of Progressive Insurance from the 1960s
to his retirement in 2000, and served as chairman until his death in
2013. He was also "a functioning pot head" who used weed for both fun
and relief from chronic pain from a leg amputation in 1998.
    John Sperling. The University of Phoenix CEO died last year at age
93, but not before publicly acknowledging that he smoked marijuana
manage the side effects of the treatment he received for prostate
cancer. He, Lewis, and George Soros were the original troika of
deep-pocketed marijuana reform businessmen; now only Soros is left,
although Lewis's estate continues to invest in legalization efforts.
    Oprah Winfrey. The iconic Oprah isn't on TV anymore, but she' worth
$3 billion and she's still the chairwoman and CEO of both Harpo
Productions and the Oprah Winfrey Network, where she's also CCO. She has
never staked out a position on marijuana legalization, but she has twice
said she smoked it, although not for a long time. She told "Watch What
Happens: Live" in 2013 that she had last smoked in 1982, and she told
"The Late Show With David Letterman" earlier this year that she hadn't
"smoked weed in 30 years."
    George Zimmer. The founder and recently ousted CEO of Men's
Wearhouse is an unabashed pot smoker, as well as a financial backer of
legalization efforts. Just a couple of weeks ago he told CNBC that he’s
“been smoking marijuana on a regular basis for about 50 years.” And he's
not take it easy after his 2013 firing, either: He has since gone on to
create online tuxedo rental and tailoring companies.

that one of Team Themis' projects was to develop potential lines of

@_subject: Alex Jones apologizes for his role in promoting "Pizzagate" 
McClatchy passes on WaPo
Alex Jones, the conspiracy-loving media personality, apologized Friday
for his role in promoting "Pizzagate," the baseless viral story that a
Washington pizza restaurant was the locale of a child sex-abuse ring run
by Hillary Clinton and her campaign chairman, John Podesta.
In a surprising and rare bit of backtracking, Jones posted a six-minute
video on his website, "InfoWars," in which he read a prepared statement
formally distancing himself and his site from what became a textbook
story of fake news run amok. He addressed his apology to James
Alefantis, the owner of Comet Ping Pong, the restaurant that was the
supposed locale of the alleged conspiracy last year.
"I made comments about Mr. Alefantis that in hindsight I regret, and for
which I apologize to him," Jones said. "We relied on third-party
accounts of alleged activities and conduct at the restaurant. We also
relied on accounts of [two] reporters who are no longer with us."
He added, "To my knowledge today, neither Mr. Alefantis nor his
restaurant Comet Ping Pong, were involved in any human trafficking as
was part of the theories about Pizzagate." The story, he said, "was
based upon what we now believe was an incorrect narrative."
Jones, a staunch supporter of Donald Trump during the presidential
campaign, offered no comment or apology to Clinton or Podesta for
outlandish statements about their alleged involvement in the abuse of
hundreds of children.
Jones didn't say what prompted his apology but it may have been
motivated by a letter Alefantis wrote to him in February. The letter
demands an apology and retraction for InfoWars' postings about
Pizzagate; it does not threaten legal action, but refers to what
Alefantis describes as "defaming" comments by InfoWars.
But the timing of Jones' apology suggests he was concerned about a
potential lawsuit. Under Texas law, the Austin-based Jones had to
retract or apologize for the stories by Friday - one full month after
receiving Alefantis' letter - to avoid exposing InfoWars to punitive
damages in a libel suit.
In a statement, Alefantis said, "I am pleased that Mr. Jones has
apologized and admitted that he and his employees repeatedly spread
falsehoods about me and my restaurant. I wish that he would have made
this admission and apology months ago. And his apology, while welcome,
does nothing to address the harm he and his company have done to me, my
business, and my community."
Alefantis' spokeswoman, Molly Levinson, said Friday that Alefantis and
his attorney "continue to evaluate our legal claims."
As the story spread, Alefantis and his employees received multiple death
threats. The rumors culminated in December when a North Carolina man,
Edgar Madisson Welch, came to the restaurant with a loaded assault rifle
and handgun in what he called an attempt to investigate the claims. He
fired the rifle several times while inside the restaurant, according to
court documents.
Welch coincidentally pleaded guilty on Friday to weapons and assault
charges in an agreement with federal prosecutors in the District.
InfoWars wasn't the principal progenitor of the false story. The story
spread primarily through such user-generated sites as Reddit and 4chan,
as well as through fake-news websites and social media.
But InfoWars played a role, publishing numerous articles and
commentaries that speculated about the alleged involvement of Clinton
and Podesta. Pizzagate was sparked by cryptic comments made by Podesta
in emails that were stolen and later released by WikiLeaks during the
Among the more damaging elements cited by Alefantis in his Feb. 22
letter was InfoWars' role in encouraging its followers "to go out and
investigate the 'Pizzagate' conspiracy theory, to come to my restaurant
and investigate lies."
In his statement, Alefantis noted, "We can all hope that Mr. Jones'
retreat is the beginning of a process to hold accountable the people who
motivated an armed gunman to travel across state lines and fire his
weapon in a family-friendly restaurant."

After all, that's so much simpler than refusing to be Airstrip One for
the US Empire.
UK: Attacker used WhatsApp, firm must help police get access
Mar. 26, 2017 | 05:28 PM
Associated Press via Lebanon Daily Star
LONDON: Westminster Bridge attacker Khalid Masood sent a WhatsApp
message that cannot be accessed because it was encrypted by the popular
messaging service, a top British security official said Sunday.
British press reports suggest Masood used the easily available messaging
service just minutes before starting a rampage Wednesday that left three
pedestrians and one police officer dead and dozens more wounded,
including some with catastrophic injuries.
Home Secretary Amber Rudd used appearances on BBC and Sky News to urge
WhatsApp and other encrypted services to make their platforms accessible
to intelligence services and police trying to carrying out lawful
"We need to make sure that organizations like WhatsApp - and there are
plenty of others like that - don't provide a secret place for terrorists
to communicate with each other," she said.
Rudd did not provide any details about Masood's use of WhatsApp, saying
only "this terrorist sent a WhatsApp message and it can't be accessed."
But her call for a "back door" system to allow authorities to access
information is likely to be met with resistance throughout the industry.
In the United States, Apple fought the FBI's request for the passcodes
needed to unlock an iPhone that had been used by one of the perpetrators
in the 2015 extremist attack on San Bernardino, California.
Masood drove a rented SUV into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge before
smashing it into Parliament's gates and rushing onto the grounds, where
he stabbed a policeman to death before he was shot dead. A detailed
police reconstruction has found the entire attack lasted 82 seconds.
Police say he acted alone but they are trying to pinpoint his motive and
identify any possible accomplices, making the WhatsApp message a
potential clue to his state of mind and his social media contacts.
Rudd said attacks like Masood's would be easier to prevent if
authorities could penetrate encrypted services after obtaining a warrant
similar to the ones used to listen in on telephone calls or - in snail
mail days - steam open letters and read their contents.
Without a change in the system, she said terrorists would be able to
communicate with each other without fear of being overheard even in
cases where a legal warrant has been obtained.
Rudd also urged technology companies to do a better job at preventing
the publication of material that promotes extremism. She plans to meet
with firms Thursday in a bid to set up an industry board that would take
steps to make the web less useful to extremists.
British police investigating the attack say they still believe Masood, a
52-year-old Briton, acted alone and say they have no indications that
further attacks are planned.
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu said it may never be possible to
fully determine Masood's motives.
"That understanding may have died with him," Basu said Saturday night as
police appealed for people who knew Masood or saw him to contact
investigators. "Even if he acted alone in the preparation, we need to
establish with absolute clarity why he did these unspeakable acts, to
bring reassurance to Londoners."
ISIS, which is losing territory in Iraq and Syria but still has radical
followers in other parts of the world, has claimed Masood was a
"soldier" carrying out its wishes to attack Western countries.
Masood had convictions for violent crimes in the U.K. and spent time in
prison. He also worked in Saudi Arabia teaching English for two years
and traveled there again in 2015 on a visa designed for religious
One 58-year-old man remains in custody in the case after being arrested
in Birmingham, where Masood had been living. He has not been charged or
named. Nine others arrested after the assault have been freed without
charges and one has been freed on bail.
The family of slain police officer Keith Palmer, meanwhile, released a
statement thanking those who tried to save his life.
"There was nothing more you could have done. You did your best and we
are just grateful he was not alone," the statement said.

"Sir, there are two passions which have a powerful influence on the
affairs of men. These are ambition and avarice; the love of power,and
the love of money. Separately each of these has great force in prompting
men to action; but when united in view of the same object, they have in
many minds the most violent effects. Place before the eyes of such men,
a post of honor that shall be at the same time a place of profit, and
they will move heaven and earth to obtain it. The vast number of such
places it is that renders the British Government so tempestuous. The
struggles for them are the true sources of all these factions which are
perpetually dividing the Nation, distracting its Councils, hurrying
sometimes into fruitless and mischievous wars, and often compelling a
submission to dishonorable terms of peace.
And of what kind are the men that will strive for this profitable
preeminence, through all the bustle of cabal, the heat of contention,
the infinite mutual abuse of parties, tearing to pieces the best of
characters? It will not be the wise and moderate; the Iovers of peace
and good order, the men fittest for the trust. It will be the bold and
the violent, the men of strong passions and indefatigable activity in
their selfish pursuits. These will thrust themselves into your
Government and be your rulers. And these too will be mistaken in the
expected happiness of their situation: For their vanquished competitors
of the same spirit, and from the same motives will perpetually be
endeavoring to distress their administration, thwart their measures, and
render them odious to the people."

In a side thread there were a number of people taking (educated) guesses
from what he was saying about which Comm chips Greenwald was discussing,
and at that time, for some intuitive reason, I got to thinking about
VPNs being advertised in mainstream computer culture at the time, to

Sharing Rides, Hoarding Profits
How the SF Bay area's technology elite are destroying poor & people of
color's incomes by 'Disruptive Innovation'
            The winners and losers in many cases of disruption are split
    along existing racial and class lines of inequality. Those with
    little economic or political power to defend themselves from the
    disruptors are seeing their livelihoods and communities turned
    upside down. Their small businesses are being destroyed. Their
    communities are becoming unaffordable… …
        “Disruption” is the zeitgeist of Silicon Valley’s tech industry,
    especially in the realm of startups. The mythos goes like this:
    small scrappy hackers with very little capital and a few computers
    can create new business models that will topple older fossilized
    companies, even whole industries. In the process the economy will
    become more efficient and everyone will have more choices. We all
    win thanks to the new Internet-enabled economy. That’s not at all
    what is happening in reality, however.
        The ideology of disruption goes back a long way in the annals
    theorizing capitalism, but the current ideology really owes more to
    Clayton Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor and devout
    Mormon who has built his academic career on case studies of
    disruptors. Christensen’s seminal 1998 article in the Harvard
    Business Review on disruption tells a story about dominant companies
    atop their industries —Firestone, Xerox, IBM— that were caught flat
    footed, and in several cases destroyed, by their smaller creative
    competitors. They failed to innovate and grow beyond their core
    markets. They failed to recognize the potential of a new technology
    that would make their existing products and services obsolete. This
    has fidelity with the actual history of American business.
        Christensen, along with his son Matthew, manages a hedge fund
    that purports to bet on disruptors and short the stock of bumbling
    giants. Christensen also sponsors a think tank he named after
    himself, the Christensen Institute, which, according to its web site
    is, “dedicated to improving the world through disruptive innovation.”
        California’s tech entrepreneurs have embraced Christensenian
    disruption. The big case studies in tech that seem to confirm
    Christensen’s theory are well known. Digital cameras destroyed film.
    Personal computers displaced mainframes as the core hardware
    business, and laptops have since eaten into a huge share of the
    personal computer market. Now mobile devices are eroding PC sales.
    None was ever seen as a threat to the existing dominant product and
    producer, but displacement happened nonetheless. Tapes replaced
    vinyl, CDs replaced tapes, but MP3s and iTunes-like services have
    replaced CDs. Cloud is displacing both the idea of storing your data
    on physical drives you own. Software as a service is chipping away
    at the idea of buying and owning software. And so on…
        In a lot of cases disruption ends up being a battle of big
    corporations for market share. Consumers and employees within the
    industry aren’t necessarily better or worse off when the smoke
    clears and a winner emerges with a new technology and business model.
        But the tech boom today is characterized by a another kind of
    disruption. It’s social disruption. New technologies and business
    models don’t just attack the existing dominant corporations; they
    attack social relations and transform non-business spheres of life
    into methodical instances of economic exchange from which the new
    tech innovators extract revenue. The tech boom is also characterized
    by disruption of smaller competitive markets by emergent tech
    monopolists backed ultimately by huge pools of private equity and
    giant, monopoly-seeking corporations.
        The winners and losers in many cases of disruption are split
    along existing racial and class lines of inequality. Those with
    little economic or political power to defend themselves from the
    disruptors are seeing their livelihoods and communities turned
    upside down. Their small businesses are being destroyed. Their
    communities are becoming unaffordable. Those with cultural capital,
    and access to economic capital have a shot at being disruptive, at
    skimming some wealth off of deregulated industry and precarious
    labor. And the wealthy individuals and companies that should be
    disrupted by a clever tech startup —the tax dodging banks, the
    Fortune 500, the health care companies and insurance giants— have
    the resources to defend themselves, fend off the geeks, deploy an
    equally clever response to retain market share, or to just buyout
    the scrappy competitor and fold it into their existing empire.
        The ridesharing phenomenon reflects all of this and more.
        Ridesharing companies like Lyft, Uber, and Sidecar use the
    ubiquitous ownership of smartphones to connect casual drivers and
    passenger clients through their proprietary applications. Like any
    broker they take...

If you look at how the FBI sets up their Muslim Frames you can see
they're all good at the job, but don't concern themselves with outcomes.
Those frame jobs have a VERY hard time in courts with juries. Those
frame jobs are just as much terrorism on the Muslim community of the US

(and at 3am on an infomercial channel ticker on teevee)
No one expects the Spanish Inquisition either...
The ACLU is a legal lobbying organization. Their modus, very much like
Peace Action, Earth Action, and a number of other lobbying orgs with
"Action" in their names, is 'come in late after other orgs in the
'trenches' like the NLG, CCR, et al, do all the hard work, take credit
for the wins or publicize the loss to claim the need for (slush)
funding, and lunch with the people they're supposed to be working
against...' Because they aren't the lawyers on the case or in the same
firm (if they're even lawyers at all) and there's no 'conflict of interest'.
They REALLY hung Nippon-Americans out to dry during the Yellow Peril
panic at the beginning of WWII, and they APPEAR to be trying to make
amends by taking a high profile in Muslim discrimination cases. But as
can be seen, they put it all in a slush fund, and the money you send
them to assist the Muslim community may very well be used to defend the
NeoNazis Bigots and Racist who persecute Muslims.
The laws are made by rich white men for rich white men's concept of

In the US, after 10 years you can no longer get many parts for you car
from the dealer. They intentionally obsolete them, ostensibly to get
allegedly 'cleaner ones' on the road, but really, force-obsoleting cars
after 10 years instead of having ones that could run indefinitely (My IH
Travelall had 40 years on it when I passed it on) is the ONLY THING that
keeps the auto industry from 'vanishing from the pages of time'.
In five years it will be infeasible for most Americans to afford a car
at all. Most people are buying them on TEN YEAR LOANS already, and...

Say goodbye to owning ANYTHING new... soon.

was the main source of power. I did. Enjoy breathing soot cunt. People

The USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT) aims to present a
broad picture of offense and its contributions, bringing together
researchers and practitioners in all areas of computer security.
Offensive security has changed from a hobby to an industry. No longer an
exercise for isolated enthusiasts, offensive security is today a
large-scale operation managed by organized, capitalized actors.
Meanwhile, the landscape has shifted: software used by millions is built
by startups less than a year old, delivered on mobile phones and
surveilled by national signals intelligence agencies.
In the field's infancy, offensive security research was conducted
separately by industry, independent hackers, or in academia.
Collaboration between these groups could be difficult. Since 2007, the
USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT) has aimed to bring
those communities together.
WOOT '17 will feature a Best Paper Award and a Best Student Paper Award.
Computer security exposes the differences between the actual mechanisms
of everyday trusted technologies and their models used by developers,
architects, academic researchers, owners, operators, and end users.
While being inherently focused on practice, security also poses
questions such as "what kind of computations trusted systems are and
aren't capable of?," which harken back to fundamentals of computability.
State-of-the-art offense explores these questions pragmatically,
gathering material for generalizations that lead to better models and
more trustworthy systems.
WOOT provides a forum for high-quality, peer-reviewed work discussing
tools and techniques for attack. Submissions should reflect the state of
the art in offensive computer security technology, exposing poorly
understood mechanisms, presenting novel attacks, or surveying the state
of offensive operations at scale.
WOOT '17 accepts papers in both an academic security context and more
applied work that informs the field about the state of security practice
in offensive techniques. The goal for these submissions is to produce
published works that will guide future work in the field. Submissions
will be peer reviewed and shepherded as appropriate.
Submission topics include but are not limited to:

You can't "Wrench" them when they're 30 years old. They've fallen apart.
By design.
I mean... I MEAN... If you really love that hole in the pavement you
pour money into, you can pour EVEN MORE MONEY into it trying to replace
parts that never fail in the designed life of the 'hole'. For instance,
my Travelall, which had ONE smog device, an OG PCV valve that wasn't
even listed as an available part because you took it apart and cleaned
it, and was, like the rest of the vehicle, intended to literally last
forever (which eventually put IH out of the small truck biz), at 30
years it had wheel rim failures (split circumferentially on the inside
of the rim mimicking a blowout), the power steering idler arm snapped
(fortunately I was parking at the time and not going 60mph), and the
door latches? Door bolts ... due to sagging hinges making the latches
unreliable at first, then non-functional. And any door/hinge assembly
you're liable to find at a junkyard or recycler is just as worn.
You CAN have the hinges rebuilt of course (Until their attachment point
on the 'hole' fails). And the brake calipers bored out by specialty
machine shops with matching Stainless Steel pucks installed like is
common with old Corvettes and Jaguars.
Just sayin'.... Spend all your money so you can scoot around in a little
metal box that isolates you from the society around you, and by
extension, those bombs falling (enter name of 3rd world nation here),
AND can't even be recycled?
That's 'progress'... towards something. But I just don't see a future in
it for humans.

IH marketed them to midwest farmers as part of a package deal (the
Central Valley of California was another hotspot and that's where alot
of the specialty wrecking yards for them are) 'for the misus' if they
bought the combine or big tractor.
It was always 'power everything'. Brakes. Steering... No such thing as a
wind-down back window. Unlike the pickup trucks which were essentially
the same vehicle  'capped  off' at the back of the front seat and a
pickup truck bed instead. There was also a "Travelette" that had seating
for four and small pickup truck bed. Quite a few were HIgh clearance 4
wheel drive versions Forestry services loved them. Literally
unbreakable, and repairable by the side of the road if something did go
wrong, and IH also supplied them to railroads where they were outfitted
with drop-down rail wheels for moving work crews around.
The running joke was alway "If the serial number was one number
different it might have been a combine instead". They came with a "Line
Setting Ticket" with the complete rundown if everything installed (like
a big rig might), and they weren't cheap. In 1965 a basic travelall
listed fr the same price as a base caddy... (Wait for it...) $10k. I'm
sure they were heavily discounted when the farmer bought the Combine....
Mine was originally a 3 speed with overdrive (horse trailer towing
vehicle) but it chucked a gear (1965-1985... 30 years) and I stuffed a 4
speed from a similar year Dodge pickup in it... which gave it a 'stump
puller' 1st gear because of the differential gear ratio mismatch. So low
I didn't need the clutch. I could rev the engine and just push the
shifter up by the 1st gear gate, and it would drop in. The truck would
lift on it's suspension about a foot, and it would start rolling. After
that it was 'gravy' to shift without the clutch. Try doing that with any
mdern transmission that uses shitty little needle bearing capped into an
aluminum housing and you'll be replacing the transmission before long.
The only problem was once you bought one... Unless something
particularly tragic happened, you never had to buy one again. That's
what killed it, and the pickup truck sales too. But in 1983 when I
needed a new rear axle for one that "Mushroomed" on brake drum removal,
the factory  still had one ... undoubtedly overmanufactured for warranty
purposes and then written off, but they had one. There's no such thing
as 'overmanufacturing for warranty purposes anymore, and if it's done
the parts are ditched as soon as written off.
That's one reason why maintaining a 'New Millennium" car like it's a
'classic', will fail. To expect an aftermarket that will still have an
"axleshaft" for a 30 year old vehicle is laughable.

Sharing Rides, Hoarding Profits
How the SF Bay area's technology elite are destroying poor & people of
color's incomes by 'Disruptive Innovation'
            The winners and losers in many cases of disruption are split
    along existing racial and class lines of inequality. Those with
    little economic or political power to defend themselves from the
    disruptors are seeing their livelihoods and communities turned
    upside down. Their small businesses are being destroyed. Their
    communities are becoming unaffordable… …
        “Disruption” is the zeitgeist of Silicon Valley’s tech industry,
    especially in the realm of startups. The mythos goes like this:
    small scrappy hackers with very little capital and a few computers
    can create new business models that will topple older fossilized
    companies, even whole industries. In the process the economy will
    become more efficient and everyone will have more choices. We all
    win thanks to the new Internet-enabled economy. That’s not at all
    what is happening in reality, however.
        The ideology of disruption goes back a long way in the annals
    theorizing capitalism, but the current ideology really owes more to
    Clayton Christensen, a Harvard Business School professor and devout
    Mormon who has built his academic career on case studies of
    disruptors. Christensen’s seminal 1998 article in the Harvard
    Business Review on disruption tells a story about dominant companies
    atop their industries —Firestone, Xerox, IBM— that were caught flat
    footed, and in several cases destroyed, by their smaller creative
    competitors. They failed to innovate and grow beyond their core
    markets. They failed to recognize the potential of a new technology
    that would make their existing products and services obsolete. This
    has fidelity with the actual history of American business.
        Christensen, along with his son Matthew, manages a hedge fund
    that purports to bet on disruptors and short the stock of bumbling
    giants. Christensen also sponsors a think tank he named after
    himself, the Christensen Institute, which, according to its web site
    is, “dedicated to improving the world through disruptive innovation.”
        California’s tech entrepreneurs have embraced Christensenian
    disruption. The big case studies in tech that seem to confirm
    Christensen’s theory are well known. Digital cameras destroyed film.
    Personal computers displaced mainframes as the core hardware
    business, and laptops have since eaten into a huge share of the
    personal computer market. Now mobile devices are eroding PC sales.
    None was ever seen as a threat to the existing dominant product and
    producer, but displacement happened nonetheless. Tapes replaced
    vinyl, CDs replaced tapes, but MP3s and iTunes-like services have
    replaced CDs. Cloud is displacing both the idea of storing your data
    on physical drives you own. Software as a service is chipping away
    at the idea of buying and owning software. And so on…
        In a lot of cases disruption ends up being a battle of big
    corporations for market share. Consumers and employees within the
    industry aren’t necessarily better or worse off when the smoke
    clears and a winner emerges with a new technology and business model.
        But the tech boom today is characterized by a another kind of
    disruption. It’s social disruption. New technologies and business
    models don’t just attack the existing dominant corporations; they
    attack social relations and transform non-business spheres of life
    into methodical instances of economic exchange from which the new
    tech innovators extract revenue. The tech boom is also characterized
    by disruption of smaller competitive markets by emergent tech
    monopolists backed ultimately by huge pools of private equity and
    giant, monopoly-seeking corporations.
        The winners and losers in many cases of disruption are split
    along existing racial and class lines of inequality. Those with
    little economic or political power to defend themselves from the
    disruptors are seeing their livelihoods and communities turned
    upside down. Their small businesses are being destroyed. Their
    communities are becoming unaffordable. Those with cultural capital,
    and access to economic capital have a shot at being disruptive, at
    skimming some wealth off of deregulated industry and precarious
    labor. And the wealthy individuals and companies that should be
    disrupted by a clever tech startup —the tax dodging banks, the
    Fortune 500, the health care companies and insurance giants— have
    the resources to defend themselves, fend off the geeks, deploy an
    equally clever response to retain market share, or to just buyout
    the scrappy competitor and fold it into their existing empire.
        The ridesharing phenomenon reflects all of this and more.
        Ridesharing companies like Lyft, Uber, and Sidecar use the
    ubiquitous ownership of smartphones to connect casual drivers and
    passenger clients through their proprietary applications. Like any
    broker they take...

The ACLU is a legal lobbying organization. Their modus, very much like

They REALLY hung Nippon-Americans out to dry during the Yellow Peril
panic at the beginning of WWII, and they APPEAR to be trying to make
amends by taking a high profile in Muslim discrimination cases. But as
can be seen, they put it all in a slush fund, and the money you send

The USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT) aims to present a
broad picture of offense and its contributions, bringing together
researchers and practitioners in all areas of computer security.
Offensive security has changed from a hobby to an industry. No longer an
exercise for isolated enthusiasts, offensive security is today a
large-scale operation managed by organized, capitalized actors.
Meanwhile, the landscape has shifted: software used by millions is built
by startups less than a year old, delivered on mobile phones and
surveilled by national signals intelligence agencies.
In the field's infancy, offensive security research was conducted
separately by industry, independent hackers, or in academia.
Collaboration between these groups could be difficult. Since 2007, the
USENIX Workshop on Offensive Technologies (WOOT) has aimed to bring
those communities together.
WOOT '17 will feature a Best Paper Award and a Best Student Paper Award.
Computer security exposes the differences between the actual mechanisms
of everyday trusted technologies and their models used by developers,
architects, academic researchers, owners, operators, and end users.
While being inherently focused on practice, security also poses
questions such as "what kind of computations trusted systems are and
aren't capable of?," which harken back to fundamentals of computability.
State-of-the-art offense explores these questions pragmatically,
gathering material for generalizations that lead to better models and
more trustworthy systems.
WOOT provides a forum for high-quality, peer-reviewed work discussing
tools and techniques for attack. Submissions should reflect the state of
the art in offensive computer security technology, exposing poorly
understood mechanisms, presenting novel attacks, or surveying the state
of offensive operations at scale.
WOOT '17 accepts papers in both an academic security context and more
applied work that informs the field about the state of security practice
in offensive techniques. The goal for these submissions is to produce
published works that will guide future work in the field. Submissions
will be peer reviewed and shepherded as appropriate.
Submission topics include but are not limited to:

You can't "Wrench" them when they're 30 years old. They've fallen apart.
By design.
I mean... I MEAN... If you really love that hole in the pavement you
pour money into, you can pour EVEN MORE MONEY into it trying to replace
parts that never fail in the designed life of the 'hole'. For instance,
my Travelall, which had ONE smog device, an OG PCV valve that wasn't
even listed as an available part because you took it apart and cleaned
it, and was, like the rest of the vehicle, intended to literally last
forever (which eventually put IH out of the small truck biz), at 30
years it had wheel rim failures (split circumferentially on the inside
of the rim mimicking a blowout), the power steering idler arm snapped
(fortunately I was parking at the time and not going 60mph), and the
door latches? Door bolts ... due to sagging hinges making the latches
unreliable at first, then non-functional. And any door/hinge assembly
you're liable to find at a junkyard or recycler is just as worn.
You CAN have the hinges rebuilt of course (Until their attachment point
on the 'hole' fails). And the brake calipers bored out by specialty
machine shops with matching Stainless Steel pucks installed like is
common with old Corvettes and Jaguars.
Just sayin'.... Spend all your money so you can scoot around in a little
metal box that isolates you from the society around you, and by
extension, those bombs falling (enter name of 3rd world nation here),
AND can't even be recycled?

IH marketed them to midwest farmers as part of a package deal (the
Central Valley of California was another hotspot and that's where alot
of the specialty wrecking yards for them are) 'for the misus' if they
bought the combine or big tractor.
It was always 'power everything'. Brakes. Steering... No such thing as a
wind-down back window. Unlike the pickup trucks which were essentially
the same vehicle  'capped  off' at the back of the front seat and a
pickup truck bed instead. There was also a "Travelette" that had seating
for four and small pickup truck bed. Quite a few were HIgh clearance 4
wheel drive versions Forestry services loved them. Literally
unbreakable, and repairable by the side of the road if something did go
wrong, and IH also supplied them to railroads where they were outfitted
with drop-down rail wheels for moving work crews around.
The running joke was alway "If the serial number was one number
different it might have been a combine instead". They came with a "Line
Setting Ticket" with the complete rundown if everything installed (like
a big rig might), and they weren't cheap. In 1965 a basic travelall
listed fr the same price as a base caddy... (Wait for it...) $10k. I'm
sure they were heavily discounted when the farmer bought the Combine....
Mine was originally a 3 speed with overdrive (horse trailer towing
vehicle) but it chucked a gear (1965-1985... 30 years) and I stuffed a 4
speed from a similar year Dodge pickup in it... which gave it a 'stump
puller' 1st gear because of the differential gear ratio mismatch. So low
I didn't need the clutch. I could rev the engine and just push the
shifter up by the 1st gear gate, and it would drop in. The truck would
lift on it's suspension about a foot, and it would start rolling. After
that it was 'gravy' to shift without the clutch. Try doing that with any
mdern transmission that uses shitty little needle bearing capped into an
aluminum housing and you'll be replacing the transmission before long.
The only problem was once you bought one... Unless something
particularly tragic happened, you never had to buy one again. That's
what killed it, and the pickup truck sales too. But in 1983 when I
needed a new rear axle for one that "Mushroomed" on brake drum removal,
the factory  still had one ... undoubtedly overmanufactured for warranty
purposes and then written off, but they had one. There's no such thing
as 'overmanufacturing for warranty purposes anymore, and if it's done
the parts are ditched as soon as written off.
That's one reason why maintaining a 'New Millennium" car like it's a
'classic', will fail. To expect an aftermarket that will still have an
"axleshaft" for a 30 year old vehicle is laughable.

PS. The dirty fucking hippies were right.
A rant originally uploaded by joeyess on Mar 17, 2009
"This is a rant about the greed that permeates the American political
landscape. In fact the very core of who we are as a nation and a people.
Until we re-regulate our glorious corporate overlords, our condition
-the Human Condition- in this country and on this planet remains in the
hands of a select group of sociopathic plutocrats that care nothing of
their nation and only about their personal fortunes.
Self appointed Masters of the Universe who don't seem to realize that
their gene pool has been diminished and dulled by decades of greed,
avarice and a sense of entitlement.
All born on 3rd base, swearing they hit a triple.
We Were Right. They will devour themselves.
My only hope is that the rest of us survive the feast. ~Joeyess
“There’s a black granite wall in Washington DC that bears 58,260 names
on it.  All of those whose names that are carved on that wall are dead. For what?  Freedom?
“If this country had listened when kids were screaming to stop that
slaughter, that wall would have been one hell of a lot shorter.
“Yet we as a nation still wage wars of choice.  Wars encouraged by
plutocrats who never have to fight them.
“Peace is never discussed.  Peace has somehow become a perjorative.
“Peace is no perjorative.  Peace is essential to the survival of the
human race.  And those who advocate for war are a dangerous and fearful
group who should be marginalized and disavowed.
“War is always the last choice.  The dirty fucking hippies … were right.
“Now the oceans have been rising.  The polar ice is melting at alarming
rates.  The climate is changing in irreversible ways.  Our survival as a
species on this planet is on a precipice.
“The science on this is clear.  Humans are now in trouble.  Because of
our reckless stewardship of what we dominated, we have polluted this
fragile jewel that hangs in space – our only home.
“The food we buy is contaminated.  The toys we give our children as
presents for Christmas are tainted with poisons.  The water we drink is
rife with carcinogens.  The fish in our seas, lakes and rivers are so
full of mercury that it’s only recommended that we eat them once per week.
“We have now come face to face with our own extinction.
“I hate to say ‘I told you so,’ but the dirty fucking hippies … were right.
“We’ve elected sociopath after sociopath for the last 30 years, to every
level of government. – many of them slaves to corporate parasites that
gorge themselves at the public trough, while the most vulnerable people
in our society – the sick, the young, and the elderly – go wanting.
“Billions of dollars of profits are being snitched up at the expense and
suffering of our neighbors by the jackals that comprise our
pharmaceutical companies and insurance companies.  Both of which pipe
their diagnostic wisdom and their fake concern right into our homes via
TV and radio commercials.
“These legal drug dealers now sell their wares with impunity.  And the
insurance gamblers perform a slick game of three-card monte right in our
living rooms.
“Most of these drugs have a list of caveats that would make even the
most dishonest used car salesman blush.  And the insurance hustlers
change the rules of the game just when it’s time to pay up – profiting
from the suffering and pain and others, profiting from human frailty.
“Universal healthcare?  ‘It’s too expensive,’ we’re told.  Gasbags
talking heads on TV and radio have been complicit in this deception,
while being handsomely compensated for their assistance.
“I’ll say it again:  the dirty fucking hippies … were right.
“Big box discount stores descend upon small towns in America like alien
ships, filled with cheap products bought at low prices from countries
that pay their workers slave wages.  Plutocrats love this business model!
“Mom and Pop shops can’t compete with prices set by these huge corporate
parasites and, to no one’s surprise, many small businesses in these tiny
hamlets fail, leaving small towns filled with empty storefronts and
even, in some cases, forcing these same small business operators to go
to work for the very people that ruined their livelihoods.
“Small-town America is subsequently decimated by this invasion.  Often
helpless in stopping it.
“Wall Street has cannibalized itself.  Still hungry, feeling the pangs
of their greed, they’ve now come to the government for their daily
meal.  And still, without a hint of irony, a spokesman for this ravenous
tribe mounts his soapbox and has the temerity to rail against the ‘evils
of Socialism’. “Turns out the Socialism is for them.  The Capitalism is for us.
“Abbie Hoffman once baited these banksters by throwing cash onto the
floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  To no one’s astonishment, they
demonstrated their insatiable greed.  The gluttons couldn’t help
themselves – they stopped trading, got on their knees, and swept up the
free loot.
“Wall Street should have been reined in long ago.
“I’ll say it again:  The dirty fucking hippies … were right!”

They were never hacked (except apparently by the people who reported it)

so maybe it's more formally a Security Breach than a dox but "UpGuard",

Some of the brightest luminaries of the time took L.
Like Richard Feynman, Alan Watts (who had some really BAD things to say
about TeeVee and indoctrination... the kind of indoctrination LSD can
eradicate with guidance ),
and Jean-Paul Sartre
Shortlist: It was in civilian circulation as an adjunct to psychotherapy for
alcoholism (and MDMA, a methamphetamine derivative with psychedelic
properties inferior to LSD, but easier to produce, is currently in use
for PTSD treatment and about to be 'normalized'.)...
It worked for Bill W, the guy who founded AA, when he was in
psychotherapy. It worked so well that all the stats kept were expunged
leaving only the fact that there were such studies done..
It 'worked' for a lot of people, who had goals in it's usage, and your
'hobbled' bullshit, just like the everlasting BS trope about Pot making
people unmotivated and apathetic... Well, they were that way to start
with. The ONLY drugs that FORCE change, are ones the
petrochemical-pharmaceutical industry 'cooks'.
Carlos Santana, "Tripper", on that.
He was tripping here  He
said he expected to go on 12 hours later but the schedule changed. Those
faces he was making? He said the neck of the guitar was turning into a
snake and he was trying to get it to 'hold still'. The performance is
STILL electrifying almost 50 years later. He never missed a lick, not a
note out of time or off-tune.
Ps... About that "revolutin" thang.

The CPD said they gave Pigasus to a farm but everyone KNOWS they
murdered and bar-b-qued him. Butchers! Assassins!
It was 1968. I was seeing the Dems do exactly the same to McCarthy, a
REAL antiwar candidate they did to their shill Bernie. They offered us
Hubert HUMPhrey... Hillary in a suit, (who just happened to get another
criminal, Richard Nixon erected), and there was George Wallace.. the
redneck governor of Alabama running as dark horse candidate.
I said to myself: "Self! If we're going to have a warmongering racist as
prezident, the least we can do is elect one we can point at and say to
the rest of the nation: "LOOK AT WTF YOU DID!"."
Well it took 50 years or so, but it's come to pass, while prog-libs
support the idea that "Antifa" is a terrorist organization that should
be destroyed, and then started to LUV Trump as soon as he gave the
generals a blank check to kill as many civilians as they like in our

... says someone who never took STP. A 3 day peak and a total burn out.
BZ was intended to be an INCAPACITATING AGENT, not a psychotropic.
Everyone knew that by 1968 and very few people actually ever used it.
Ps. I have problems with MDMA as an 'analogue' to LSD. MDMA is
methamphetamine based and although it exhibits certain
psychedeic-experience-like properties, it's still Meth, and the long
term effect of it's use, if not as dramatic (usually), IS similar.

STP was a whole 'nother thing. The 'trip' was described somewhere (I
think Abbie Hoffman in Revolution for the Hell of It) as 'long and
juiceless' ...
It's METHAMPHETAMINE, which also has clinical uses. Raving till you chew
thru your pacifier and drop from dehydration isn't 'clinical'. Just sayin'.
I knew the people who distrubuted MDA on the East Coast in the 60s and
MDA had the same deleterious effects from long term usage. AFAICT LSD
had no effects that would be noted by psychologists or behavioral
therapists as 'deleterious'.
By 1969 or 1970, or 71, or so, most of what was passed off as LSD was
either ALD-52 or MDA, or some other designer drug. When LSD became
illegal in the US not only did the feds immediately clamp down on all
the organic resources such as Ergotamine Tartrate, indole, and other
items necessary for LSD production (A special # Sylvania blue bulb was
necessary at one point in it's manufacture. IMAGINE what would happen if
a lighting house received an oddball order for a few), as was noted at
the time in the underground newspapers, many of the supply houses WERE
THE FEDS, and they used the mailing lists quite effectively to shut down
You might want to listen to this... From one of Owsley's close personal
friends, on his passing.
March 15 2011 Travus T. Hipp Morning News & Commentary: Owsley, The Man
Who 'Changed The Minds' Of An Entire Generation... Literally... Passes
Owsley wasn't a chemist you know... He was a speedfreak. His GF was an
organic chemist, and as is so succinctly pointed out here, what made
Owsley the 'name you could trust' in LSD, was he actually tried the shit
before he sold it. Most of what was passed off as L was made by scumbags
not far removed from the Mafia (Brotherhood of Eternal Light at their
former missile silo in was it Nebraska?). The Mafia LUVS chemicals. Easy
to transport unlike bulky stinky weed, and the one thing I noted in my
experience in NY, when ever you got around L dealers, you started seeing
guns, and people who looked A LOT like feds.
As you described it, "empathogen,", it has certain SPECIFIC effects,
just like every other ordinary pharmaceutical, and just because you feel
all lovey dovey DOES NOT NOR HAS IT EVER MEANT, you 'explored your inner
space'. The phrase "Adjunct to Psychotherapy" come to mind. Tripping
with a bunch of people who are just like wow I love you groovy then they
go back to my day job slicing throats at some corporate hack job or
another, doesn't, and WHERE IS THE "GUIDANCE"? It's the hedonists
leading the hedonists down the rosy path to... I dunno. Running into a
fire at "burning man" or some stupid thing like that.
Torture (in 1st case), and Social engineering/subterfuge (2nd) is
cheaper and just as "reliable".
Gil Scott-Heron on Street Corner Chemistry. A short poem precedes:
I figure, even in 1968, only about half of what I ever consumed was
actually LSD, and my bottom line is I don't know why anyone would bother
with chemicals today when you can purchase 'mushrooom kits' and the seed
houses no longer give a fuck if you're buying Hawaiian Wood Rose pods or

the last remaining OG STP family (pre-roadie alcoholic street gang)
people showed it to him and he just crumpled it up and... . His name
was/is George, a straight, slightly effeminate puerto rican kid who had
been working a a grocery delivery boy... He showed up one morning at me
and my GF's safe house sponsored by Jewish Family Services (until the
certified folks could contact the kid's parents or investigate abuse
claims as reason not to contact). George ended up with a new persona.
Sgt Pepper! He literally affected a brit accent (Ringo). Wore a brass
button blazer. Talked in Be-At-Els type rhyme. I lost track of him when
I moved to Vt in '73, but ran into him again at Earth People's Park
Shattuck Ave house when I first got to California in 1976. He was 'back

@_subject: Nobody But Us: The Rise and Fall of the Golden Age of Signals 
Ben Buchanan
Thursday, September 7, 2017
"Traditionally, signals intelligence is neatly bifurcated into offense
and defense: intercept adversaries’ communication technology and protect
one’s own. In the modern era, however, there is great convergence in the
technologies used by friendly nations and by hostile ones. I’ve tried to
tackle some of this in a new paper, “Nobody But Us: The Rise and Fall of
the Golden Age of Signals Intelligence.” It’s published as part of the
Hoover Institution's Aegis Paper Series.
My animating idea is that signals intelligence agencies find themselves
in a dilemma: they must penetrate the very same technologies that they
also at times must protect. The United States perhaps feels this tension
most acutely, for a variety of reasons. To resolve it, the United States
and its partners have relied on an approach sometimes called Nobody But
Us, or NOBUS: target communications mechanisms using unique methods
accessible only to the United States. This approach, which calls for
advanced methods, aims to protect communications from American
adversaries, yet also ensure American access when needed.
But the NOBUS approach depends as well on a number of American
advantages that are under serious threat. These advantages for a time
enabled what many have called “the golden age of signals intelligence.”
The decline of these advantages renews the tension between offense and
defense once more. My paper examines how the NOBUS approach works, its
limits, and the challenging matter of what comes next."

Big security flaw. Dingleberry downplayed it. Said there was a ticket
for it, and requested assistance.
-------- Forwarded Message --------
Reply-To: 	tor-talk at lists.torproject.org
This involves *at least* Linux (Mint 18.1) Tor Browser 7.04 and 7.05, over at least a couple months.
This seems like a huge privacy / anonymity issue.
Why is there a *"recently-used.xbel"*, file in my Tor Browser installation directory - in path shown and  labeled as file TYPE: "XBEL bookmarks" recording ACTUAL local file names, dates, times - they were accessed AND some DOWNLOADED files (like *.pdf) with dates and times?
~/.torbrowser/torbrowser-7.0/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/.local/share/recently-used.xbel. *TBB is installed in home directory: ~/.torbrowser.*
For instance, Listed is a downloaded *pdf file, about health issues* and many others.
All dates shown in THIS instance of recently-used.xbel seem to be in July and Aug, 2017, but I used the same TBB installation before and after the dates shown in recently-used.xbel .
In Linux, there's also a ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel file - by default, but it is set asimmutable, so nothing written to it.
The TBB recently-used.xbel file even shows date and time I downloaded TBB 7.0.4, and a random 6 digit string added after the "visited" time, with 'Z" at the end, such as (I removed actual times & 6 digit string:
Each file record shown in "recently-used.xbel" show this:
Also, are files in the  path  below, with .bin or .toc extensions:
~/.torbrowser/torbrowser-7.0/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/.nv/GLCache/********************************/*******************************1af.bin (very long, random strings, I removed)
  ~/.torbrowser/torbrowser-7.0/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/.nv/GLCache//********************************/*******************************1af.toc
These .bin and .toc files seem ? related to my Nvidia GPU or drivers?  Not sure what's in them.  The same type files are written to the ~/.nv folder, but I don't see why they're written to a Tor Browser folder.
I don't know the meaning of  "bookmark" in this context -  in the TBB recently-used.xbel file.
Tor Browser is supposed to delete / not store any data to disk after it's closed (or not write to disk at all).

Links on page:
CCleaner Malware Targeted Tech Giants Cisco, Google, Microsoft
Kelly Sheridan
The backdoor discovered in Avast's CCleaner targeted top tech companies
including Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Sony, VMware, and Cisco.
When Cisco Talos and Morphisec discovered a version of Avast CCleaner
had been compromised to deliver malware, it was bad enough to learn
millions of endpoints were threatened. Now, security experts say the
attackers had espionage in mind.
Earlier this week, both firms published research detailing the
compromise of CCleaner version 5.33, which was available for download
from August 15, 2017 until the release of v5.34 on September 12. The
binary included in v5.33 contained a multi-stage malware payload to
collect information including a list of running processes and all
software installed on the machine.
Further analysis on the attack, published by Talos on Sept. 20,
unearthed some concerning details.
Researchers acquired an archive of files stored on the attackers'
command and control (C2) server, which contained code listing major
organizations targeted with a second-stage loader. If a machine from one
of those networks connected, it would be hit with a secondary payload.
"What happened is the attacker was using this giant net," says Craig
Williams, senior technical lead at Cisco Talos. "In the four days the
command and control server had data for, 700,000 victims connected with
it … but [the attackers] only wanted a tiny fraction of them."
Analysis of the C2 tracking database, which spanned four days in
September, revealed at least 20 victim machines hit with specialized
secondary payloads. Targeted organizations included Microsoft, Google,
HTC, Sony, Samsung, D-Link, Akamai, VMware, Linksys, and Cisco itself.
During that timeframe, the malware regularly contacted the C2 server to
send information about infected systems. This included IP addresses,
online time, hostname, domain name, process listings, and other data.
Researchers believe attackers likely used this to determine which
machines they should target during the campaign's final stages.
"This is pretty much exactly what we expected," says Williams. "It quite
literally fits the definition of an APT."
Because Cisco Talos was only able to analyze four days of activity
during the time CCleaner v5.33 was available for download, he continues,
they have no idea how often this list of corporations was altered. They
believe the target list was changed during the period the C2 server was
active in order to compromise different businesses.
"When you hear two million machines were infected, it implies a
commodity criminal," says John Bambenek, manager of threat systems at
Fidelis Cybersecurity. "Now we're talking corporate environments, and
it's hard to see that as anything other than an espionage attack."
Williams says the recommendations stay the same for affected businesses:
systems should be wiped, restored from backup, or reinstalled. This is
an example of why users need to have reliable backups amid the rise of
supply-chain attacks.
"From the advent of this discovery, we had been warning users to recover
from backups," he emphasizes. "We had been telling people, nobody knows
what happened so you have to recover from backups."
Who did it?
Both Bambenek and Williams say the attack is well-made and likely the
work of a sophisticated actor, though it's still unclear who it might be.
The contents of the Web directory taken from the C2 server included PHP
files responsible for controlling communications with infected machines.
One of these files, which contains core variables and operations used,
specifies the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the time zone.
Williams says this does not mean Chinese actors are responsible. In
fact, he believes the opposite. This is especially well-crafted malware,
made with a significant amount of development time and complex database.
If it really was China, why leave the timestamp?
"I suspect it's a false flag," he proposes, though it's hard to say for
Interestingly, Bambenek points out, CCleaner was a curious choice for
this victim pool.
"My first thought was, I'm not entirely sure how many of these
enterprises would have used CCleaner," says Fidelis' Bambenek. "This is
casting a broad net for an app you probably wouldn't find in enterprise
While he says this may not be a particularly successful attack in terms
of the hackers' true objectives, it shows threat actors are willing to
think outside the box to achieve their goals.
"Two million infected computers is nothing to shake a fist at," he
notes. "It shows they're willing to try new things and experiment. The
adversary doesn't have complete visibility into what's typically used in
enterprises. They need to make guesses."

"This is a rant about the greed that permeates the American political

Until we re-regulate our glorious corporate overlords, our condition

hands of a select group of sociopathic plutocrats that care nothing of
their nation and only about their personal fortunes.

They were never hacked (except apparently by the people who reported it)

so maybe it's more formally a Security Breach than a dox but "UpGuard",

Some of the brightest luminaries of the time took L.
Like Richard Feynman, Alan Watts (who had some really BAD things to say
about TeeVee and indoctrination... the kind of indoctrination LSD can
eradicate with guidance ),
and Jean-Paul Sartre
Shortlist: It was in civilian circulation as an adjunct to psychotherapy for
alcoholism (and MDMA, a methamphetamine derivative with psychedelic
properties inferior to LSD, but easier to produce, is currently in use
for PTSD treatment and about to be 'normalized'.)...
It worked for Bill W, the guy who founded AA, when he was in
psychotherapy. It worked so well that all the stats kept were expunged
leaving only the fact that there were such studies done..
It 'worked' for a lot of people, who had goals in it's usage, and your
'hobbled' bullshit, just like the everlasting BS trope about Pot making
people unmotivated and apathetic... Well, they were that way to start
with. The ONLY drugs that FORCE change, are ones the
petrochemical-pharmaceutical industry 'cooks'.
Carlos Santana, "Tripper", on that.
He was tripping here  He
said he expected to go on 12 hours later but the schedule changed. Those
faces he was making? He said the neck of the guitar was turning into a
snake and he was trying to get it to 'hold still'. The performance is
STILL electrifying almost 50 years later. He never missed a lick, not a

... says someone who never took STP. A 3 day peak and a total burn out.
BZ was intended to be an INCAPACITATING AGENT, not a psychotropic.
Everyone knew that by 1968 and very few people actually ever used it.
Ps. I have problems with MDMA as an 'analogue' to LSD. MDMA is
methamphetamine based and although it exhibits certain
psychedeic-experience-like properties, it's still Meth, and the long
term effect of it's use, if not as dramatic (usually), IS similar.

STP was a whole 'nother thing. The 'trip' was described somewhere (I
think Abbie Hoffman in Revolution for the Hell of It) as 'long and
juiceless' ...
It's METHAMPHETAMINE, which also has clinical uses. Raving till you chew
thru your pacifier and drop from dehydration isn't 'clinical'. Just sayin'.
I knew the people who distrubuted MDA on the East Coast in the 60s and
MDA had the same deleterious effects from long term usage. AFAICT LSD
had no effects that would be noted by psychologists or behavioral
therapists as 'deleterious'.
By 1969 or 1970, or 71, or so, most of what was passed off as LSD was
either ALD-52 or MDA, or some other designer drug. When LSD became
illegal in the US not only did the feds immediately clamp down on all
the organic resources such as Ergotamine Tartrate, indole, and other
items necessary for LSD production (A special # Sylvania blue bulb was
necessary at one point in it's manufacture. IMAGINE what would happen if
a lighting house received an oddball order for a few), as was noted at
the time in the underground newspapers, many of the supply houses WERE
THE FEDS, and they used the mailing lists quite effectively to shut down

friends, on his passing.
March 15 2011 Travus T. Hipp Morning News & Commentary: Owsley, The Man

Owsley wasn't a chemist you know... He was a speedfreak. His GF was an
organic chemist, and as is so succinctly pointed out here, what made
Owsley the 'name you could trust' in LSD, was he actually tried the shit
before he sold it. Most of what was passed off as L was made by scumbags
not far removed from the Mafia (Brotherhood of Eternal Light at their
former missile silo in was it Nebraska?). The Mafia LUVS chemicals. Easy
to transport unlike bulky stinky weed, and the one thing I noted in my
experience in NY, when ever you got around L dealers, you started seeing
guns, and people who looked A LOT like feds.
As you described it, "empathogen,", it has certain SPECIFIC effects,
just like every other ordinary pharmaceutical, and just because you feel

Gil Scott-Heron on Street Corner Chemistry. A short poem precedes:
I figure, even in 1968, only about half of what I ever consumed was
actually LSD, and my bottom line is I don't know why anyone would bother
with chemicals today when you can purchase 'mushrooom kits' and the seed

Salvia in bulk, etc.

I forget what Hoffman's dose was estimated as being, but he was a
tripper once a year till the day he died
10 micrograms wouldn't do a whole lot, unless you eat a lot of paper or
gels or whatever. The typical dose was SUPPOSED TO BE 250 - 350 mics...
Sandoz standard dosage was 350mics
I knew a guy who ate a whole sheet of Blue Dot blotter in 1971. One of
the last remaining OG STP family (pre-roadie alcoholic street gang)
people showed it to him and he just crumpled it up and... . His name
was/is George, a straight, slightly effeminate puerto rican kid who had
been working a a grocery delivery boy... He showed up one morning at me
and my GF's safe house sponsored by Jewish Family Services (until the
certified folks could contact the kid's parents or investigate abuse
claims as reason not to contact). George ended up with a new persona.
Sgt Pepper! He literally affected a brit accent (Ringo). Wore a brass
button blazer. Talked in Be-At-Els type rhyme. I lost track of him when
I moved to Vt in '73, but ran into him again at Earth People's Park
Shattuck Ave house when I first got to California in 1976. He was 'back
to earth'; the George I met when he first showed up at my E4th and B
Lower East Side slum apartment, but 5 years older (20 or so).

@_subject: Nobody But Us: The Rise and Fall of the Golden Age of Signals 
Ben Buchanan
Thursday, September 7, 2017
"Traditionally, signals intelligence is neatly bifurcated into offense
and defense: intercept adversaries’ communication technology and protect
one’s own. In the modern era, however, there is great convergence in the
technologies used by friendly nations and by hostile ones. I’ve tried to
tackle some of this in a new paper, “Nobody But Us: The Rise and Fall of
the Golden Age of Signals Intelligence.” It’s published as part of the
Hoover Institution's Aegis Paper Series.
My animating idea is that signals intelligence agencies find themselves
in a dilemma: they must penetrate the very same technologies that they
also at times must protect. The United States perhaps feels this tension
most acutely, for a variety of reasons. To resolve it, the United States
and its partners have relied on an approach sometimes called Nobody But
Us, or NOBUS: target communications mechanisms using unique methods
accessible only to the United States. This approach, which calls for
advanced methods, aims to protect communications from American
adversaries, yet also ensure American access when needed.
But the NOBUS approach depends as well on a number of American
advantages that are under serious threat. These advantages for a time
enabled what many have called “the golden age of signals intelligence.”
The decline of these advantages renews the tension between offense and
defense once more. My paper examines how the NOBUS approach works, its
limits, and the challenging matter of what comes next."

Big security flaw. Dingleberry downplayed it. Said there was a ticket
for it, and requested assistance.
-------- Forwarded Message --------
Reply-To: 	tor-talk at lists.torproject.org
This involves *at least* Linux (Mint 18.1) Tor Browser 7.04 and 7.05, over at least a couple months.
This seems like a huge privacy / anonymity issue.
Why is there a *"recently-used.xbel"*, file in my Tor Browser installation directory - in path shown and  labeled as file TYPE: "XBEL bookmarks" recording ACTUAL local file names, dates, times - they were accessed AND some DOWNLOADED files (like *.pdf) with dates and times?
~/.torbrowser/torbrowser-7.0/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/.local/share/recently-used.xbel. *TBB is installed in home directory: ~/.torbrowser.*
For instance, Listed is a downloaded *pdf file, about health issues* and many others.
All dates shown in THIS instance of recently-used.xbel seem to be in July and Aug, 2017, but I used the same TBB installation before and after the dates shown in recently-used.xbel .
In Linux, there's also a ~/.local/share/recently-used.xbel file - by default, but it is set asimmutable, so nothing written to it.
The TBB recently-used.xbel file even shows date and time I downloaded TBB 7.0.4, and a random 6 digit string added after the "visited" time, with 'Z" at the end, such as (I removed actual times & 6 digit string:
Each file record shown in "recently-used.xbel" show this:
Also, are files in the  path  below, with .bin or .toc extensions:
~/.torbrowser/torbrowser-7.0/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/.nv/GLCache/********************************/*******************************1af.bin (very long, random strings, I removed)
  ~/.torbrowser/torbrowser-7.0/tor-browser_en-US/Browser/.nv/GLCache//********************************/*******************************1af.toc
These .bin and .toc files seem ? related to my Nvidia GPU or drivers?  Not sure what's in them.  The same type files are written to the ~/.nv folder, but I don't see why they're written to a Tor Browser folder.
I don't know the meaning of  "bookmark" in this context -  in the TBB recently-used.xbel file.
Tor Browser is supposed to delete / not store any data to disk after it's closed (or not write to disk at all).

When Cisco Talos and Morphisec discovered a version of Avast CCleaner
had been compromised to deliver malware, it was bad enough to learn
millions of endpoints were threatened. Now, security experts say the
attackers had espionage in mind.
Earlier this week, both firms published research detailing the
compromise of CCleaner version 5.33, which was available for download
from August 15, 2017 until the release of v5.34 on September 12. The
binary included in v5.33 contained a multi-stage malware payload to
collect information including a list of running processes and all
software installed on the machine.
Further analysis on the attack, published by Talos on Sept. 20,
unearthed some concerning details.
Researchers acquired an archive of files stored on the attackers'
command and control (C2) server, which contained code listing major
organizations targeted with a second-stage loader. If a machine from one
of those networks connected, it would be hit with a secondary payload.
"What happened is the attacker was using this giant net," says Craig
Williams, senior technical lead at Cisco Talos. "In the four days the
command and control server had data for, 700,000 victims connected with
it … but [the attackers] only wanted a tiny fraction of them."
Analysis of the C2 tracking database, which spanned four days in
September, revealed at least 20 victim machines hit with specialized
secondary payloads. Targeted organizations included Microsoft, Google,
HTC, Sony, Samsung, D-Link, Akamai, VMware, Linksys, and Cisco itself.
During that timeframe, the malware regularly contacted the C2 server to
send information about infected systems. This included IP addresses,
online time, hostname, domain name, process listings, and other data.
Researchers believe attackers likely used this to determine which
machines they should target during the campaign's final stages.
"This is pretty much exactly what we expected," says Williams. "It quite
literally fits the definition of an APT."
Because Cisco Talos was only able to analyze four days of activity
during the time CCleaner v5.33 was available for download, he continues,
they have no idea how often this list of corporations was altered. They
believe the target list was changed during the period the C2 server was
active in order to compromise different businesses.
"When you hear two million machines were infected, it implies a
commodity criminal," says John Bambenek, manager of threat systems at
Fidelis Cybersecurity. "Now we're talking corporate environments, and
it's hard to see that as anything other than an espionage attack."
Williams says the recommendations stay the same for affected businesses:
systems should be wiped, restored from backup, or reinstalled. This is
an example of why users need to have reliable backups amid the rise of
supply-chain attacks.
"From the advent of this discovery, we had been warning users to recover
from backups," he emphasizes. "We had been telling people, nobody knows
what happened so you have to recover from backups."
Who did it?
Both Bambenek and Williams say the attack is well-made and likely the
work of a sophisticated actor, though it's still unclear who it might be.
The contents of the Web directory taken from the C2 server included PHP
files responsible for controlling communications with infected machines.
One of these files, which contains core variables and operations used,
specifies the People's Republic of China (PRC) as the time zone.
Williams says this does not mean Chinese actors are responsible. In
fact, he believes the opposite. This is especially well-crafted malware,
made with a significant amount of development time and complex database.
If it really was China, why leave the timestamp?
"I suspect it's a false flag," he proposes, though it's hard to say for
Interestingly, Bambenek points out, CCleaner was a curious choice for
this victim pool.
"My first thought was, I'm not entirely sure how many of these
enterprises would have used CCleaner," says Fidelis' Bambenek. "This is
casting a broad net for an app you probably wouldn't find in enterprise
While he says this may not be a particularly successful attack in terms
of the hackers' true objectives, it shows threat actors are willing to
think outside the box to achieve their goals.
"Two million infected computers is nothing to shake a fist at," he
notes. "It shows they're willing to try new things and experiment. The
adversary doesn't have complete visibility into what's typically used in
enterprises. They need to make guesses."

"The United States government has seized Backpage.com, the controversial classifieds website. A notice informing visitors of the seizure was posted on the site, and a Justice Department spokesperson confirmed the notice.
According to the notice, the website and its affiliates were seized “as part of an enforcement action” by the FBI, as well as other federal and local agencies. The notice provides little other information, saying the Department of Justice will provide more at 6PM EST today.
Backpage was the target of allegations that it facilitated sex trafficking and prostitution through its adult section, a controversy that took years to unwind and culminated in the arrest of the company’s CEO and eventual removal of the adult section.
“The FBI can confirm that law enforcement activity is occurring,” a spokesperson for the FBI’s Phoenix field office told The Verge. The office referred further questions to the Justice Department, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last month, Congress passed controversial legislation meant to give law enforcement more power to stop online sex trafficking. Backpage became a central part of the discussion around the legislation, which many sex workers opposed.

Meanwhile the average Westerner would categorically deny their governments does any of that and their government denies they do it.

It doesn't appear that she ever actually paid into the retirement system as a wage earner or by voluntary contribution.
SSI is paid to impoverished people who never worked a day in their lives once they turn 65 for instance, or to people who drug/alcohol damage themselves, can't work, and never got enough quarters of work in to qualify for retirement benefits. My meager retirement check will be supplemented with SSI when I turn 65.
According to FACT she took the money at the insistence of close acquaintances to keep her from going broke due to her medical bills. That's SSDI, again, NOT money derived for an individual's payment into the system.

Burning Miracles My understanding is that like all gall, Social Security payments are
divided into three parts: SSI, SSDI, and retirement benefits. Sometimes
people think of SSDI as retirement benefits for those forced, pressured,
or opting to retire early by disability qualification/identification,
and SSI is available to many more but the payments are low, not enough
to live on autonomously without participation in covert economies or
gray market economies.
A full SSI payment today is $981, more than many folks, including my, retirement benefit check. At 65 my retirement benefits, about 1/2 of minimum wage at the time my paycheck employment ended, will be brought up to that amount by supplementing it from the SSI fund. That fund is also a slush fund for certain people who are 'damaged' but not eligible for SSDI, like drug and alcohol casualties, who USED TO get SSDI, but are no longer eligible (the ones already on disability were 'grandfathered'). The thing about SSI is it's mutability. It's derived from the SS trust but there's nothing requiring it by law... meaning it could vanish and the funds allocated to other uses.
As many probably know, under US taxes freelancers today pay into
retirement benefits, which are only available to recoup if you've served
the overt economy enough for 40 "work credits". These same 40 come up if
a freelancer asks for a social security statement for purposes of, e.g.,
estimating SSDI payments. Some individuals qualified as disabled get
both SSDI and SSI, some only get one or the other. Today.
I don't know exactly what this was like in Rand's day, nor how she got
paid royalties or advances for Fountainhead, the Gary Cooper movie based
on it, etc. Seems like she liked money enough to live in NYC for much of
her life. But, Rand's husband wanted to paint and drank himself to
death, is the prevailing story out of the Nathaniel Branden Institute
faction etc. So there's that. I assume the Ayn Rand Institute guards
Rand's business contracts etc. That funny story about Peikoff trying to
get back the Fountainhead manuscript pages he donated to the gubment
because of his choice of words, "stealing" some of the pages etc.
This is difficult for me to parse, sounds like misogyny, except I assume
there's some sarcasm/irony embedded that may make sense to you if not
For "never worked a day in their lives", define work. Is straightening
up one's home and volunteering for Food Not Bombs 'work' according to Razer?

A full SSI payment today is $981, more than many folks, including my, retirement benefit check. At 65 my retirement benefits, about 1/2 of minimum wage at the time my paycheck employment ended, will be brought up to that amount by supplementing it from the SSI fund. That fund is also a slush fund for certain people who are 'damaged' but not eligible for SSDI, like drug and alcohol casualties, who USED TO get SSDI, but are no longer eligible (the ones already on disability were 'grandfathered'). The thing about SSI is it's mutability. It's derived from the SS trust but there's nothing requiring it by law... meaning it could vanish and the funds allocated to other uses.
As many probably know, under US taxes freelancers today pay into
retirement benefits, which are only available to recoup if you've served
the overt economy enough for 40 "work credits". These same 40 come up if
a freelancer asks for a social security statement for purposes of, e.g.,
estimating SSDI payments. Some individuals qualified as disabled get
both SSDI and SSI, some only get one or the other. Today.
I don't know exactly what this was like in Rand's day, nor how she got
paid royalties or advances for Fountainhead, the Gary Cooper movie based
on it, etc. Seems like she liked money enough to live in NYC for much of
her life. But, Rand's husband wanted to paint and drank himself to
death, is the prevailing story out of the Nathaniel Branden Institute
faction etc. So there's that. I assume the Ayn Rand Institute guards
Rand's business contracts etc. That funny story about Peikoff trying to
get back the Fountainhead manuscript pages he donated to the gubment
because of his choice of words, "stealing" some of the pages etc.
This is difficult for me to parse, sounds like misogyny, except I assume
there's some sarcasm/irony embedded that may make sense to you if not
For "never worked a day in their lives", define work. Is straightening
up one's home and volunteering for Food Not Bombs 'work' according to Razer?

Breaking: InfoWars Moves To Ban Alex Jones
AUSTIN, TX—Saying that it was a long-overdue step given the radio show host’s history of offensive and dangerous rhetoric, InfoWars reportedly moved Thursday to ban right wing provocateur Alex Jones from its platform. 
“Mr. Jones has repeatedly violated our policies against hate speech and misinformation, and so we have had no choice but to terminate our relationship with him,” read a statement from InfoWars editor Paul Joseph Watson, citing a litany of abuses committed by the radio host and conspiracy theorist, including harassment of minorities, trans individuals, and the parents of the Sandy Hook victims.
“Of course, InfoWars remains committed to free speech, but that does not include repeatedly spreading vicious lies about private individuals. It would be unacceptable, and frankly cowardly, for us to hide behind the First Amendment as this man continues doing real harm. That is why, from today forward, all four of Mr. Jones’s shows will be deleted, and every mention of him will be completely scrubbed from the site.” 
Watson added that their platform would continue to publish the high-quality reporting on globalism, creeping Sharia, and Deep State false-flag operations that their users had come to expect.

Actually, they came for VenezuelaAnalysis.com's FB page today. What DID you expect? They need to suppress some information before they can pound the BIG LIE narrative into the sheeple's heads for a while, THEN they'll let you speak.
All 'they' really need to do is suppress alternative information until they've pounded their narrative into the mainstream society's heads, then they let you speak. They dont have to eliminate your voice, just strategically suppress it when necessary for their goals. For instance, the company that made Colin Powell's "Saddam CWD Lab", as seen by everyone at the UN, called the media and the US government the very next morning and explained that they were hydrogen generators for WWII vintage "barrage balloons", that were floated over cities to dissuade bombing runs. SOME media even reported it. On page E-31, two days later, so to speak. Whose story is going to be remembered as fact?
Ps. You have to be, literally, a moron, not to be able to source the information being presented by marketing scumholes like infowars  freethoughtproject, etc.

But what should REALLY gall everyone, even true blue patriots is the fact that Congress told the Pentagon to stop supplying logistics like refueling aircraft and targeting intel to the school bus bombing Saudis fighting our proxy war in Yemen, and the pentagram said, in so many words, "Sorry Dave.

I wasn't really suggesting using guns to overthow the government. You might like this explanation of why.
Randazza at the libertarian legalwonkblog popehat:
"In 1776, when the height of military technology was a musket and a cannon, both of which you could make by melting down church bells, there might have been something to it. When the contest was little more than numbers of guns you could drag through the woods, and how to play the weather, the government probably did need to worry a bit about insurrection – and that might have kept them a bit more honest.
However, the first time someone tried that kind of thing, it didn't work out so well. In fact, Shays' Rebellion just led to Constitutional tweaks to make the federal government that much stronger. The Civil War led to even more, with harsher consequences.
If 13 states, with the assistance of at least one superpower, didn't manage to get their way through armed insurrection, what the hell makes anyone think that armed insurgency is going to preserve our right to … whatever … not have affordable health care, or to coffee cups that say "Happy Birthday Jesus" on them?
Ok, fine… lets come up with a cause worth fighting for. Lets say that Obama refuses to step down in 2016, and he not only declares himself dictator-for-life, but he also starts dressing like Ghadaffi, decrees that the national religion shall be Islam, the national language will be Klingon, there will be an efficient rail network in the United States, the writ of Prima Noctae is now in effect, and there shall be martial law to enforce all of the above, as well as any other laws that the President invents, on a daily basis.
We managed to preserve our right to keep military grade rifles and machine guns, so we all muster down on the Town Common with our guns. We tried voting. We tried protesting. This is a reasonable time to start with the armed insurrection stuff.
So, you, me, all our neighbors, hell our entire city builds a perimeter around it. We fill sandbags, we all have ammunition, we all have food, water, supplies, and most importantly, we are all unified and in complete solidarity.
And we stand there, resisting whatever it is the government was going to do to us.
And then they fly over with one jet, dropping one FAE bomb, and roll in with three tanks, and in about 12 hours, our "resistance" is reduced to a few smoking holes. The Tree of Liberty will get its manure all right, but it will be the manure that you shat out as you ran for cover, as long range artillery rains down on our town, as we get carpet bombed from 35,000 feet, and as the sky goes black with drones and cruise missiles.
We're screwed.
So… if the 2nd Amendment's "right to revolution" implication is real, both practically and legally, it must also include a right to possess tanks, jets, rocket launchers, etc. Your puny AK-47 is useless. So, we need to have at least some of our volunteer resistance show up with Stinger missiles, some anti-aircraft batteries, maybe a submarine or two?
Oh, you can't afford that?
That's ok, we have some patriotic citizens who can.
Who? The same billionaires who already own the government, that's who. So what do they want to "resist?" I could only see them wanting to resist checks on their own power. So, if the Second Amendment implies a right to resist the government, then that would mean that we need our billionaire friends to start stockpiling these weapons now. We need a Koch brothers airfield with a few fighters and bombers, and Adelson should have a fleet of tanks somewhere, and I guess that George Soros would bring his collection of nuke-armed submarines up to date, right?
So lets drop the crazy scenario of Obama-cum-Ghadaffi, and just think about something we were really likely to see upset us. Do you think for a moment that you, living in some apartment in Salt Lake City, or a house in Wyoming, or a condo in Boca Raton, would be ready to go to war with the Federal Government over the same shit that would get the Koch Brothers to fuel up their private stock of A10 Warthogs? Really?
Because you know what the billionaires want the government to stop doing? They want it to get out of the way of their becoming trillionaires. If you think that the Second Amendment means what the Supreme Court said in Heller, and you believe that is a good thing, because it gives you the ability to resist the government, you might want to play out the long game in your head. The long game here is this interpretation leads to private armies, raised by limitless wealth, all of which looks at our quaint little republican form of government as nothing more than a paper justification to have a flag waving over a few national parks."

AUSTIN, TX—Saying that it was a long-overdue step given the radio show host’s history of offensive and dangerous rhetoric, InfoWars reportedly moved Thursday to ban right wing provocateur Alex Jones from its platform. 
“Mr. Jones has repeatedly violated our policies against hate speech and misinformation, and so we have had no choice but to terminate our relationship with him,” read a statement from InfoWars editor Paul Joseph Watson, citing a litany of abuses committed by the radio host and conspiracy theorist, including harassment of minorities, trans individuals, and the parents of the Sandy Hook victims.
“Of course, InfoWars remains committed to free speech, but that does not include repeatedly spreading vicious lies about private individuals. It would be unacceptable, and frankly cowardly, for us to hide behind the First Amendment as this man continues doing real harm. That is why, from today forward, all four of Mr. Jones’s shows will be deleted, and every mention of him will be completely scrubbed from the site.” 
Watson added that their platform would continue to publish the high-quality reporting on globalism, creeping Sharia, and Deep State false-flag operations that their users had come to expect.

Actually, they came for VenezuelaAnalysis.com's FB page today. What DID you expect? They need to suppress some information before they can pound the BIG LIE narrative into the sheeple's heads for a while, THEN they'll let you speak.
All 'they' really need to do is suppress alternative information until they've pounded their narrative into the mainstream society's heads, then they let you speak. They dont have to eliminate your voice, just strategically suppress it when necessary for their goals. For instance, the company that made Colin Powell's "Saddam CWD Lab", as seen by everyone at the UN, called the media and the US government the very next morning and explained that they were hydrogen generators for WWII vintage "barrage balloons", that were floated over cities to dissuade bombing runs. SOME media even reported it. On page E-31, two days later, so to speak. Whose story is going to be remembered as fact?
Ps. You have to be, literally, a moron, not to be able to source the information being presented by marketing scumholes like infowars  freethoughtproject, etc.

Barrett Brown is a big-headed egotistical schmuck who alienates people. Julian Assange has an ego, but he knows how to check it, work with others, and get things done. Assange has allies.

That's only the tip of the shitberg (android does not try to correct that word btw). There's the Black Budget for all the dirty wars, destabilizations by proxy (chechen islamist bombing russian theaters... tsarnaev's family was involved in that covert operation), et al.
But what should REALLY gall everyone, even true blue patriots is the fact that Congress told the Pentagon to stop supplying logistics like refueling aircraft and targeting intel to the school bus bombing Saudis fighting our proxy war in Yemen, and the pentagram said, in so many words, "Sorry Dave. I can't do that.", yet Congress never even hesitated to pass, or threaten to sequester funding one thin dime of the NDAA.

I wasn't really suggesting using guns to overthow the government. You might like this explanation of why.
Randazza at the libertarian legalwonkblog popehat:
"In 1776, when the height of military technology was a musket and a cannon, both of which you could make by melting down church bells, there might have been something to it. When the contest was little more than numbers of guns you could drag through the woods, and how to play the weather, the government probably did need to worry a bit about insurrection – and that might have kept them a bit more honest.
However, the first time someone tried that kind of thing, it didn't work out so well. In fact, Shays' Rebellion just led to Constitutional tweaks to make the federal government that much stronger. The Civil War led to even more, with harsher consequences.
If 13 states, with the assistance of at least one superpower, didn't manage to get their way through armed insurrection, what the hell makes anyone think that armed insurgency is going to preserve our right to … whatever … not have affordable health care, or to coffee cups that say "Happy Birthday Jesus" on them?
Ok, fine… lets come up with a cause worth fighting for. Lets say that Obama refuses to step down in 2016, and he not only declares himself dictator-for-life, but he also starts dressing like Ghadaffi, decrees that the national religion shall be Islam, the national language will be Klingon, there will be an efficient rail network in the United States, the writ of Prima Noctae is now in effect, and there shall be martial law to enforce all of the above, as well as any other laws that the President invents, on a daily basis.
We managed to preserve our right to keep military grade rifles and machine guns, so we all muster down on the Town Common with our guns. We tried voting. We tried protesting. This is a reasonable time to start with the armed insurrection stuff.
So, you, me, all our neighbors, hell our entire city builds a perimeter around it. We fill sandbags, we all have ammunition, we all have food, water, supplies, and most importantly, we are all unified and in complete solidarity.
And we stand there, resisting whatever it is the government was going to do to us.
And then they fly over with one jet, dropping one FAE bomb, and roll in with three tanks, and in about 12 hours, our "resistance" is reduced to a few smoking holes. The Tree of Liberty will get its manure all right, but it will be the manure that you shat out as you ran for cover, as long range artillery rains down on our town, as we get carpet bombed from 35,000 feet, and as the sky goes black with drones and cruise missiles.
We're screwed.
So… if the 2nd Amendment's "right to revolution" implication is real, both practically and legally, it must also include a right to possess tanks, jets, rocket launchers, etc. Your puny AK-47 is useless. So, we need to have at least some of our volunteer resistance show up with Stinger missiles, some anti-aircraft batteries, maybe a submarine or two?
Oh, you can't afford that?
That's ok, we have some patriotic citizens who can.
Who? The same billionaires who already own the government, that's who. So what do they want to "resist?" I could only see them wanting to resist checks on their own power. So, if the Second Amendment implies a right to resist the government, then that would mean that we need our billionaire friends to start stockpiling these weapons now. We need a Koch brothers airfield with a few fighters and bombers, and Adelson should have a fleet of tanks somewhere, and I guess that George Soros would bring his collection of nuke-armed submarines up to date, right?
So lets drop the crazy scenario of Obama-cum-Ghadaffi, and just think about something we were really likely to see upset us. Do you think for a moment that you, living in some apartment in Salt Lake City, or a house in Wyoming, or a condo in Boca Raton, would be ready to go to war with the Federal Government over the same shit that would get the Koch Brothers to fuel up their private stock of A10 Warthogs? Really?
Because you know what the billionaires want the government to stop doing? They want it to get out of the way of their becoming trillionaires. If you think that the Second Amendment means what the Supreme Court said in Heller, and you believe that is a good thing, because it gives you the ability to resist the government, you might want to play out the long game in your head. The long game here is this interpretation leads to private armies, raised by limitless wealth, all of which looks at our quaint little republican form of government as nothing more than a paper justification to have a flag waving over a few national parks."

@_subject: Fwd: Quora hacked (html) 
Dear Auntie Imperial,
We are writing to let you know that we recently discovered that some user data was compromised as a result of unauthorized access to our systems by a malicious third party. We are very sorry for any concern or inconvenience this may cause. We are working rapidly to investigate the situation further and take the appropriate steps to prevent such incidents in the future.
What Happened
On Friday we discovered that some user data was compromised by a third party who gained unauthorized access to our systems. We're still investigating the precise causes and in addition to the work being conducted by our internal security teams, we have retained a leading digital forensics and security firm to assist us. We have also notified law enforcement officials.
While the investigation is still ongoing, we have already taken steps to contain the incident, and our efforts to protect our users and prevent this type of incident from happening in the future are our top priority as a company.
What information was involved
The following information of yours may have been compromised:
Account and user information, e.g. name, email, IP, user ID, encrypted password, user account settings, personalization data
Public actions and content including drafts, e.g. questions, answers, comments, blog posts, upvotes
Data imported from linked networks when authorized by you, e.g. contacts, demographic information, interests, access tokens (now invalidated)
Non-public actions, e.g. answer requests, downvotes, thanks
Questions and answers that were written anonymously are not affected by this breach as we do not store the identities of people who post anonymous content.
What we are doing
While our investigation continues, we're taking additional steps to improve our security:
We’re in the process of notifying users whose data has been compromised.
Out of an abundance of caution, we are logging out all Quora users who may have been affected, and, if they use a password as their authentication method, we are invalidating their passwords.
We believe we’ve identified the root cause and taken steps to address the issue, although our investigation is ongoing and we’ll continue to make security improvements.
We will continue to work both internally and with our outside experts to gain a full understanding of what happened and take any further action as needed.
What you can do
We’ve included more detailed information about more specific questions you may have in our help center, which you can find here.
While the passwords were encrypted (hashed with a salt that varies for each user), it is generally a best practice not to reuse the same password across multiple services, and we recommend that people change their passwords if they are doing so.
It is our responsibility to make sure things like this don’t happen, and we failed to meet that responsibility. We recognize that in order to maintain user trust, we need to work very hard to make sure this does not happen again. There’s little hope of sharing and growing the world’s knowledge if those doing so cannot feel safe and secure, and cannot trust that their information will remain private. We are continuing to work very hard to remedy the situation, and we hope over time to prove that we are worthy of your trust.

Facebook admitted years ago they used AI to monitor for [selector] words ... So now the feds want direct access instead. Meh.
The current ringtone on my phone is a voicemail request from special agent Delligan (always Irish) from the Capitol Police requesting I contact him regarding a post I made this April on Facebook.
That was a post regarding flaws I saw in the Congressional baseball game tryouts. Facebook's AI flagged it. I was never notified, and it wasn't removed (facebook doesn't have my phone # Verizon gave that up I suppose.)
My threat analysis was flagged as a threat.  That could have happened on messenger too.
And that's not the end of the FB hiliarity. A couple of months ago I was suspended for posting a Memories post their own AI suggested I rehash. The word "faggot" as it might be used by a couple of queens fighting was ok when I first put that post on site. I recieved an anaemic apology a week later saying it was a 'technical flaw'.
The memories AI wasn't communicating with the badword flagging AI... and they're going to let this shit drive cars!

@_subject: Fwd: Quora hacked (html) 
Dear Auntie Imperial,
We are writing to let you know that we recently discovered that some user data was compromised as a result of unauthorized access to our systems by a malicious third party. We are very sorry for any concern or inconvenience this may cause. We are working rapidly to investigate the situation further and take the appropriate steps to prevent such incidents in the future.
What Happened
On Friday we discovered that some user data was compromised by a third party who gained unauthorized access to our systems. We're still investigating the precise causes and in addition to the work being conducted by our internal security teams, we have retained a leading digital forensics and security firm to assist us. We have also notified law enforcement officials.
While the investigation is still ongoing, we have already taken steps to contain the incident, and our efforts to protect our users and prevent this type of incident from happening in the future are our top priority as a company.
What information was involved
The following information of yours may have been compromised:
Account and user information, e.g. name, email, IP, user ID, encrypted password, user account settings, personalization data
Public actions and content including drafts, e.g. questions, answers, comments, blog posts, upvotes
Data imported from linked networks when authorized by you, e.g. contacts, demographic information, interests, access tokens (now invalidated)
Non-public actions, e.g. answer requests, downvotes, thanks
Questions and answers that were written anonymously are not affected by this breach as we do not store the identities of people who post anonymous content.
What we are doing
While our investigation continues, we're taking additional steps to improve our security:
We’re in the process of notifying users whose data has been compromised.
Out of an abundance of caution, we are logging out all Quora users who may have been affected, and, if they use a password as their authentication method, we are invalidating their passwords.
We believe we’ve identified the root cause and taken steps to address the issue, although our investigation is ongoing and we’ll continue to make security improvements.
We will continue to work both internally and with our outside experts to gain a full understanding of what happened and take any further action as needed.
What you can do
We’ve included more detailed information about more specific questions you may have in our help center, which you can find here.
While the passwords were encrypted (hashed with a salt that varies for each user), it is generally a best practice not to reuse the same password across multiple services, and we recommend that people change their passwords if they are doing so.
It is our responsibility to make sure things like this don’t happen, and we failed to meet that responsibility. We recognize that in order to maintain user trust, we need to work very hard to make sure this does not happen again. There’s little hope of sharing and growing the world’s knowledge if those doing so cannot feel safe and secure, and cannot trust that their information will remain private. We are continuing to work very hard to remedy the situation, and we hope over time to prove that we are worthy of your trust.

When the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies shot up late last year, insurance agent Ryan James wanted in on the action. He hit a trifecta.
Unfortunately for James, the trifecta was in three get-rich-quick companies that crashed in value, drew the attention of U.S. and Canadian regulators and highlighted the dangers of the go-go world of digital currency.
The sharp skid in fortunes of the three companies — USI-Tech Limited, BitConnect and DavorCoin — has triggered hundreds of millions of dollars in losses for clients around the world, and perhaps more...

When the price of bitcoin and other digital currencies shot up late last year, insurance agent Ryan James wanted in on the action. He hit a trifecta.
Unfortunately for James, the trifecta was in three get-rich-quick companies that crashed in value, drew the attention of U.S. and Canadian regulators and highlighted the dangers of the go-go world of digital currency.
The sharp skid in fortunes of the three companies — USI-Tech Limited, BitConnect and DavorCoin — has triggered hundreds of millions of dollars in losses for clients around the world, and perhaps more...

Randalls Island Live edition. Black activists had taken over the small soccer stadium off harlem NY where the 3 day concert took place with the help of a number of white ny radicals and made it a free concert.
The song opens with their road manager explaining to some surly looking BPPs how they had to negotiate a pay cut with another venue they were booked at because they wanted to be THERE, and how much the band liked playing NY... Madison Square Garden... 
One of them says "This isnt Madison Square Garden its a political protest."

James Kunstler's cynical forecast includes BTC
"Bitcoin and other cryptos have a superficial appeal as a wealth safe haven supposedly out-of-reach of avaricious governments — if you don’t consider everything else that’s wrong with it. (Yesterday, Dec 31, Australia’s biggest banks froze the accounts of Bitcoin investors.) I think the safe haven idea will prove fallacious. Governments are already finding ways to interfere, using taxation schemes and shutting down exchanges. Bitcoin’s other claims on “moneyness” look bogus as well. It’s too unstable to be a medium of exchange, and too difficult to even access when need to sell, and you certainly can’t price anything in it as it shoots up and crashes every day. Bitcoin went way up because people — or maybe just algorithms — saw it going way up, so they hitched a ride. The rush to the exits will be brutal. Its final resting place will be zero, but perhaps not without a trip or two to nosebleed levels in 2018, especially as other markets wobble in the first half of the year. Bitcoin $50-K wouldn’t surprise me. But I’m not among the buyers. Enjoy the show...:

Time Stamp Counter should be virtualized. The white hat counterpart to Rutkowski's blue pillno out of order execution, or any other just in time compilationno speculative executionimplicit parallelization
implement major components of the operating system in hardware, Xen is only twenty megabytes which is comparable to maximum bitstream size for some FPGAarguably the only thing that needs to be implemented in silicon is the ALU, and the buseach core has multiple threads, even shadow threads invisible to root meant to handle interuptsto deal with context switch delays, pipeline threads, this may be called a ready queue?if a processor can rename registers on the fly, it should be able to load processes quicklyin fact this may be to some degree done with hyper threading, although unsure why it is apparently limited to two threads per CPU, although it may require multiple instruction decoding 
buffers, " It seems like the P4 flushes its micro-op cache as part of handling an interrupt"  this still wouldn't prevent having two threads per CPU, and at least one standby thread, particularly if a branch prediction buffer is removed
eDRAM cache buffer scheduled threads, and to partially virtualize L1 caches for them. maybe no shared caches, everything must be copied into L1 first.
the best possible compromise for single thread performance is to allow the OS to flag a thread with a high priority, two threads with unequal priority on a core will mean the higher priority thread will run until its allotted cycles run out or there is a stall, creating de facto coarse multithreading, although this seems unlikely to be needed
apparently dynamic power use has been reducing, so speculative execution is not as big of a power hog as increasing clock speed
copy on write should be done in a way to avoid any possible race condition, if multiple processes are aware of data before it is marked copy on write, it is being done wrongincoherent data should be avoidedanything in complexity that exceeds the short term memory of the smartest programmers should be avoided
branch prediction apparently involves flushing instructions halfway executed?ideally flushing is constant time to avoid side channels, which would make it easier as well, although more hardware intensive
overall illogical and detrimentral design decisions have led to the erosion of computer security.emphasis on single thread performance neglects modern computing design
obviously branch prediction or any other optimization should be toggled for cryptography
 are many ways of performing a context switch. The x86 CPU provides a way of doing it completely in hardware, but for performance and portability reasons most modern OS's do 
context switches in software.
The upshot is this: Intel's x86 is a high-level language. Coding everything up according to Agner Fog's instruction timings still won't produce the predictable, constant-time code you are looking for. There may be some solutions, like using CMOV, but it will take research.
research... hmmm... execute and then check or check then execute?

look at it, but it's often only nearly as opaque as byte code :)
Thats where crowdsourced blockers come into the picture. NoScript for instance. You have dozens of folks unobfuscating the scripts.

Further, At LEAST 90% of all those junk mortgages were used to buy investment properties which the owners attempted to pay down by leasing and renting, and later airbnb-ing them, driving up housing costs nationwide.

James Kunstler's cynical forecast includes BTC
"Bitcoin and other cryptos have a superficial appeal as a wealth safe haven supposedly out-of-reach of avaricious governments — if you don’t consider everything else that’s wrong with it. (Yesterday, Dec 31, Australia’s biggest banks froze the accounts of Bitcoin investors.) I think the safe haven idea will prove fallacious. Governments are already finding ways to interfere, using taxation schemes and shutting down exchanges. Bitcoin’s other claims on “moneyness” look bogus as well. It’s too unstable to be a medium of exchange, and too difficult to even access when need to sell, and you certainly can’t price anything in it as it shoots up and crashes every day. Bitcoin went way up because people — or maybe just algorithms — saw it going way up, so they hitched a ride. The rush to the exits will be brutal. Its final resting place will be zero, but perhaps not without a trip or two to nosebleed levels in 2018, especially as other markets wobble in the first half of the year. Bitcoin $50-K wouldn’t surprise me. But I’m not among the buyers. Enjoy the show...:

Ofc the hardware could be compromised.
Example. Compass Automation. A company that makes the S/w tools to put backdoors in chips. Senator Dianne Feinstein's military-industrial millionaire hubby has interest in Compass, or whatever it calls itself now. Interesting to note she's a fixture on the Senate Intel Committee.

Time Stamp Counter should be virtualized. The white hat counterpart to Rutkowski's blue pillno out of order execution, or any other just in time compilationno speculative executionimplicit parallelization
implement major components of the operating system in hardware, Xen is only twenty megabytes which is comparable to maximum bitstream size for some FPGAarguably the only thing that needs to be implemented in silicon is the ALU, and the buseach core has multiple threads, even shadow threads invisible to root meant to handle interuptsto deal with context switch delays, pipeline threads, this may be called a ready queue?if a processor can rename registers on the fly, it should be able to load processes quicklyin fact this may be to some degree done with hyper threading, although unsure why it is apparently limited to two threads per CPU, although it may require multiple instruction decoding 
buffers, " It seems like the P4 flushes its micro-op cache as part of handling an interrupt"  this still wouldn't prevent having two threads per CPU, and at least one standby thread, particularly if a branch prediction buffer is removed
eDRAM cache buffer scheduled threads, and to partially virtualize L1 caches for them. maybe no shared caches, everything must be copied into L1 first.
the best possible compromise for single thread performance is to allow the OS to flag a thread with a high priority, two threads with unequal priority on a core will mean the higher priority thread will run until its allotted cycles run out or there is a stall, creating de facto coarse multithreading, although this seems unlikely to be needed
apparently dynamic power use has been reducing, so speculative execution is not as big of a power hog as increasing clock speed
copy on write should be done in a way to avoid any possible race condition, if multiple processes are aware of data before it is marked copy on write, it is being done wrongincoherent data should be avoidedanything in complexity that exceeds the short term memory of the smartest programmers should be avoided
branch prediction apparently involves flushing instructions halfway executed?ideally flushing is constant time to avoid side channels, which would make it easier as well, although more hardware intensive
overall illogical and detrimentral design decisions have led to the erosion of computer security.emphasis on single thread performance neglects modern computing design
obviously branch prediction or any other optimization should be toggled for cryptography
 are many ways of performing a context switch. The x86 CPU provides a way of doing it completely in hardware, but for performance and portability reasons most modern OS's do 
context switches in software.
The upshot is this: Intel's x86 is a high-level language. Coding everything up according to Agner Fog's instruction timings still won't produce the predictable, constant-time code you are looking for. There may be some solutions, like using CMOV, but it will take research.
research... hmmm... execute and then check or check then execute?

About the whistleblower in that incident, a recon helo pilot named Hugh Thompson Jr. He didn't just blow the whistle, he crammed it down their throats. 
Ten years ago today I posted this about his actions at My Lai that caused news that may have been the turning point for mainstream American's view of the Vietnam War.
Thompson turned to Colburn and Andreotta (...his door gunners, manning M60 machine guns. ) and told them that if the Americans began shooting at the villagers or him, they should fire their M60 machine guns at the Americans:[4]

 Further, considering the Nazi MSM is saying because the American Nazi's hitherto unknown facemen, Milo and Spencer got bored with it and went on to sell products on InfoWars (milo) and claim they were simply 'tired of it' (spencer), your Nazi MSM would market the concept that Antifa, whatever that means, actually eliminated the historically longstanding Nazi tendency.

Dear auntieimperial,

The IRA engages in electronic disinformation and propaganda campaigns around the world using phony social media accounts. When we uncovered these accounts, we notified law enforcement, terminated the accounts, and deleted their original posts.         While investigating their activity on Tumblr, we discovered that you either followed one of these accounts linked to the IRA, or liked or reblogged one of their posts:         1-800-gloupbest-usa-todayblacktolivecartnsncreal previously known as: feelmydragonballsfedupwithlying previously known as: badgyalforyouhustleinatrap previously known as: thenaturecanpost, tumblercubeinfo-mix previously known as: americanstatistics, crazypolitician, girlsagainst, illegalmom, just-stat, rochelbarrlagonegirlmassivelydopepolicemassmedear previously known as: massblog021mooseblogtimespostingwhileblack previously known as: ghettablasta, heygeraldmartinjohanssen, honestinjun, nativewolveshererebellloudwiththecrowd previously known as: massivelystrangetyrantsumchckn previously known as: blondeinpolitics, blvckcommunity, classylgbthomie, hwuudoin, politixblondieswagintherain previously known as: blacklivesmatterusa, carzwithgirlzthis-truly-brutal-world previously known as: awesomewhitepearl, free-mind-and-soul
    You aren’t in trouble, and don’t need to take any action if you don’t want to. We deleted the accounts but decided to leave up any reblog chains so that you can curate your own Tumblr to reflect your own personal views and perspectives.

@_subject: Fwd: [heads] heads 0.4 is released! 
Not dead yet!
It's been a while, but heads is a part of a larger ecosystem that needed
work, to enable heads moving forward. 0.4 (except possible bugfixes and
updates) is probably the final release before heads is ready to apply
for the GNU free distribution list, and of course, will bring cool new
 download heads 0.4
Lots of work has been done on the Devuan SDK, which is the base
environment used for the heads build system. heads is now based on
Devuan Beowulf (Testing), which is equivalent to Debian Buster. Here we
have access to actual up to date software, rather than old frozen
versions which lack today's features. The plan for the persistence setup
in heads is laid down and will be ready for 1.0.
I also want to thank you for the bitcoins that have been donated to
heads. This is very appreciated. During the time of heads' existence,
people have donated close to 0.1033 BTC. Thank you ❤
By the way, due to popular demand - the "financial report" is now
automatically regenerated every 15 minutes.
As for the changelog:
Privesc bug fixed
heads has been rebased on Devuan Beowulf (Testing), which brings us
current-day software and no planned obsolecence.
Our new init system is sysvinit combined with OpenRC. This is a modern
approach to init and it's working quite stable.
Less bloat
heads does not depend on Debian's live-boot/live-config anymore.
Instead, we have a minimal way of bringup that is a lot more auditable
than the thousands of lines of spaghetti shell scripts Debian is able to
This release also removes some big software like evince, in order to
replace it with more minimal replacements - in this case zathura. More
can be seen in the git commits of heads' build system.
 heads' own initramfs
More Debian bloat. heads now builds and ships with its own initramfs,
which holds just enough to bring up the system, and is  statically
linked in its entirety, instead of having random kernel modules, dynamic
libraries, and other scary stuff inside. The logic stays the same, half
of the available RAM ends up as the volatile storage. The storage is the
same that live-boot produces - overlayfs over /. The fun thing is that
we are able to do this in about 100 lines of shell.
For more detailed changes, see the git logs, and the ChangeLog file in
the build system repository.

Siccome stiamo partecipando al generosissimo fundraising di DuckDuckGo! (vedi sopra) e ti stiamo chiedendo di farci delle donazioni usandolo, abbiamo deciso di dare un'occhiata alla piattaforma che esso utilizza. Come stiamo provando a chiarire attraverso le nostre newsletter e le informazioni sul nostro sito, la sicurezza e la privacy assoluta non esistono e vogliamo darti le informazioni necessarie a prendere una decisione consapevole su quale livello di perdita di dati è più appropriata per te.
CrowdRise è una piattaforma di crowd funding. La sua grande idea è di rendere il crowd funding "giocoso". Ci sono delle sfide, dei bonus giornalieri ed in questo modo ad essere divertente. Tuttavia, quando abbiamo tolto gli strati superficiali e siamo andati a vedere come funzionano le cose, abbiamo visto che si tratta di un servizio costruito sulla sorveglianza e sul tracciamento delle informazioni personali.
Infatti, se sul tuo browser fosse installato l'ottimo add-on di DuckDuckGo "Privacy Essentials", vedresti che esso bloccherebbe 10 dei tracker usati da CrowdRise.
Quando accedi a CrowdRise, queste sono le compagnie che ti stanno tracciando:
* Gigya (tracciamento dei clienti ed identificazione personale)
* Linked In (tracciamento dei clienti ed identificazione personale)
* Mixpanel (tracciamento dell'utente e analisi)
* Hubspot (tracciamento dell'utente e marketing)
* Swiftype (tracciamento dell'utente e ricerca analitica)
* Optimizely (test ed analisi)
* New Relic (analisi di business)
In aggiunta, ci sono tracker dei maggiori monopoli di internet, che quindi sanno quali sono i tuoi interessi nelle donazioni (tra di essi ci sono Google, Facebook, Twitter e Amazon), e tracker dei maggiori network pubblicitari (AddRoll, Rubicon Project, Yahoo Ads, Bidswitch, OpenX, and AdNxs). Se includi i network che fanno il delivery dei contenuti, visitare CrowdRise fa sì che tu venga tracciato da 21 differenti multinazionali.
La normativa sulla privacy di CrowdRise inizia affermando che CrowdRise è "impegnata nel rispettare e proteggere la tua privacy". La loro normativa sulla privacy continua chiarendo che le cose stanno esattamente al contrario: loro desiderano condividere i tuoi dati per quasi tutti gli scopi commerciali che possono immaginare [2].
La sorveglianza riguarda sempre il potere. Queste multinazionali vogliono i tuoi dati per avere il potere su di te, puro e semplice. L'obiettivo del tracciare i comportamenti e per consentire al capitale globale di scrutare i tuoi desideri più intimi, le relazioni e le insicurezze. Questo tipo di sorveglianza è stato usato per un po' per manipolarti e farti desiderare e voler comprare le cose. Tuttavia recentemente è diventato chiaro che il raccogliere dati viene usato anche per eleggere tiranni, far tacere i dissidenti, incarcerare i poveri, deportare i migranti e finanziare le guerre.
Cosa significa per un buon servizio che rispetta la privacy come DuckDuckGo! lanciare la propria "Privacy Challenge" [3] usando una piattaforma come CrowdRise? Cosa significa il fatto che organizzazioni di cui ci fidiamo e che ci difendono dalla sorveglianza di massa come Freedom of the Press Foundation, Demand Progress, Center for Democracy and Technology, Tails, Tor, Fight for the Future, Access Now e Riseup partecipano a questa campagna?
Noi pensiamo che probabilmente significa che è molto difficile sottrarsi completamente alla sorveglianza del capitalismo. Noi abbiamo deciso di prendere parte a questa campagna perché vogliamo dare ai nostri utenti la possibilità di raddoppiare le loro donazioni. Allo stesso tempo, pensiamo anche che sia importante che voi conosciate il contesto e le conseguenze che ci sono dietro le piattaforme tecnologiche sulle quali fate affidamento.
Se l'enorme database nel cloud che traccia i tuoi movimenti online non ti spaventa troppo, allora per favore fai in modo che la tua donazione raddoppi contribuendo qui: Altrimenti considera che puoi anche donare direttamente su Riseup: Ci sono anche alcune mezze misure tecniche che puoi adottare per limitare il tracciamento che siti come CrowdRise sono in grado di fare. Vedi la nostra pagina "Better Web Browsing" per dettagli [4]. Questi accorgimenti non colpiscono direttamente i dati raccolti da CrowdRise o dalle compagnie delle carte di credito, ma possono aiutarti a rilasciare meno dati a numerosi trackers che cercano di costruire un profilo completo riguardo i tuoi comportamenti.
Con amore,
Gli uccelli di Riseup

That's my conclusion as well.  I think it was Robert Heinlein who said
that the most artistic way to lie is to tell the truth, maybe even the
whole truth, so unconvincingly that everyone is sure you're lying.
Whenever I catch Alex Jones "telling the truth" it turns out to be an
exercise in the said art form.
A professionally fabricated quasi-religiuos Conspiracy Belief System has
displaced the FAR more sane and respectable homegrown Conspiracy Theory
market it emulates, with our little droogie Alex leading the way.
Alex and his ilk work hard to persuade /most/ of the public that
dissident opinions and information contradicting corporate a.k.a.
'mainstream' propaganda narratives are insane opinions based on ignorant
lies.  Those who do buy into the narrative become de facto sock puppets
who can be counted on to catapult the propaganda via social media
networks, and to smear the stinking shit-stain of "lunatick beliefs" all
over any dissident social or political activity their Dear Leader
directs them to participate in.
Mostly I think our ruling class just wants to finish looting everyone
else's assets.  I don't think that the most destructive aspects of this
process represent a plan to exterminate the human species, but rather, a
consequence of the ignorance, greed, and perverse incentives inherent in
corporate capitalism.
An equal and in some respects opposite species of propaganda narrative
targets the ruling class and its more senior servants assets, with the
message that Super Science can and will solve /any/ material problem at
any scale, laws of physics be damned, as soon as it becomes necessary to
do so.  I have known some "smart" people who earnestly believe this
nonsense, while dismissing the somewhat /less/ ignorant and irrational

About the whistleblower in that incident, a recon helo pilot named Hugh Thompson Jr. He didn't just blow the whistle, he crammed it down their throats. 
Ten years ago today I posted this about his actions at My Lai that caused news that may have been the turning point for mainstream American's view of the Vietnam War.
Thompson turned to Colburn and Andreotta (...his door gunners, manning M60 machine guns. ) and told them that if the Americans began shooting at the villagers or him, they should fire their M60 machine guns at the Americans:[4]

I agree with the other examples you cited, but I would not call illegal
(re-)immigration a victimless crime in all circumstances. I agree our
immigration laws are broken as currently written and enforced; however,
dealing with illegal aliens takes resources away from the rest of us,
especially given that they often do not pay the appropriate amount of
taxes back into the system compared to someone here legally.

 Further, considering the Nazi MSM is saying because the American Nazi's hitherto unknown facemen, Milo and Spencer got bored with it and went on to sell products on InfoWars (milo) and claim they were simply 'tired of it' (spencer), your Nazi MSM would market the concept that Antifa, whatever that means, actually eliminated the historically longstanding Nazi tendency.

@_subject: Fwd: [heads] heads 0.4 is released! 
Not dead yet!
It's been a while, but heads is a part of a larger ecosystem that needed
work, to enable heads moving forward. 0.4 (except possible bugfixes and
updates) is probably the final release before heads is ready to apply
for the GNU free distribution list, and of course, will bring cool new
 download heads 0.4
Lots of work has been done on the Devuan SDK, which is the base
environment used for the heads build system. heads is now based on
Devuan Beowulf (Testing), which is equivalent to Debian Buster. Here we
have access to actual up to date software, rather than old frozen
versions which lack today's features. The plan for the persistence setup
in heads is laid down and will be ready for 1.0.
I also want to thank you for the bitcoins that have been donated to
heads. This is very appreciated. During the time of heads' existence,
people have donated close to 0.1033 BTC. Thank you ❤
By the way, due to popular demand - the "financial report" is now
automatically regenerated every 15 minutes.
As for the changelog:
Privesc bug fixed
heads has been rebased on Devuan Beowulf (Testing), which brings us
current-day software and no planned obsolecence.
Our new init system is sysvinit combined with OpenRC. This is a modern
approach to init and it's working quite stable.
Less bloat
heads does not depend on Debian's live-boot/live-config anymore.
Instead, we have a minimal way of bringup that is a lot more auditable
than the thousands of lines of spaghetti shell scripts Debian is able to
This release also removes some big software like evince, in order to
replace it with more minimal replacements - in this case zathura. More
can be seen in the git commits of heads' build system.
 heads' own initramfs
More Debian bloat. heads now builds and ships with its own initramfs,
which holds just enough to bring up the system, and is  statically
linked in its entirety, instead of having random kernel modules, dynamic
libraries, and other scary stuff inside. The logic stays the same, half
of the available RAM ends up as the volatile storage. The storage is the
same that live-boot produces - overlayfs over /. The fun thing is that
we are able to do this in about 100 lines of shell.
For more detailed changes, see the git logs, and the ChangeLog file in
the build system repository.

Siccome stiamo partecipando al generosissimo fundraising di DuckDuckGo! (vedi sopra) e ti stiamo chiedendo di farci delle donazioni usandolo, abbiamo deciso di dare un'occhiata alla piattaforma che esso utilizza. Come stiamo provando a chiarire attraverso le nostre newsletter e le informazioni sul nostro sito, la sicurezza e la privacy assoluta non esistono e vogliamo darti le informazioni necessarie a prendere una decisione consapevole su quale livello di perdita di dati è più appropriata per te.
CrowdRise è una piattaforma di crowd funding. La sua grande idea è di rendere il crowd funding "giocoso". Ci sono delle sfide, dei bonus giornalieri ed in questo modo ad essere divertente. Tuttavia, quando abbiamo tolto gli strati superficiali e siamo andati a vedere come funzionano le cose, abbiamo visto che si tratta di un servizio costruito sulla sorveglianza e sul tracciamento delle informazioni personali.
Infatti, se sul tuo browser fosse installato l'ottimo add-on di DuckDuckGo "Privacy Essentials", vedresti che esso bloccherebbe 10 dei tracker usati da CrowdRise.
Quando accedi a CrowdRise, queste sono le compagnie che ti stanno tracciando:
* Gigya (tracciamento dei clienti ed identificazione personale)
* Linked In (tracciamento dei clienti ed identificazione personale)
* Mixpanel (tracciamento dell'utente e analisi)
* Hubspot (tracciamento dell'utente e marketing)
* Swiftype (tracciamento dell'utente e ricerca analitica)
* Optimizely (test ed analisi)
* New Relic (analisi di business)
In aggiunta, ci sono tracker dei maggiori monopoli di internet, che quindi sanno quali sono i tuoi interessi nelle donazioni (tra di essi ci sono Google, Facebook, Twitter e Amazon), e tracker dei maggiori network pubblicitari (AddRoll, Rubicon Project, Yahoo Ads, Bidswitch, OpenX, and AdNxs). Se includi i network che fanno il delivery dei contenuti, visitare CrowdRise fa sì che tu venga tracciato da 21 differenti multinazionali.
La normativa sulla privacy di CrowdRise inizia affermando che CrowdRise è "impegnata nel rispettare e proteggere la tua privacy". La loro normativa sulla privacy continua chiarendo che le cose stanno esattamente al contrario: loro desiderano condividere i tuoi dati per quasi tutti gli scopi commerciali che possono immaginare [2].
La sorveglianza riguarda sempre il potere. Queste multinazionali vogliono i tuoi dati per avere il potere su di te, puro e semplice. L'obiettivo del tracciare i comportamenti e per consentire al capitale globale di scrutare i tuoi desideri più intimi, le relazioni e le insicurezze. Questo tipo di sorveglianza è stato usato per un po' per manipolarti e farti desiderare e voler comprare le cose. Tuttavia recentemente è diventato chiaro che il raccogliere dati viene usato anche per eleggere tiranni, far tacere i dissidenti, incarcerare i poveri, deportare i migranti e finanziare le guerre.
Cosa significa per un buon servizio che rispetta la privacy come DuckDuckGo! lanciare la propria "Privacy Challenge" [3] usando una piattaforma come CrowdRise? Cosa significa il fatto che organizzazioni di cui ci fidiamo e che ci difendono dalla sorveglianza di massa come Freedom of the Press Foundation, Demand Progress, Center for Democracy and Technology, Tails, Tor, Fight for the Future, Access Now e Riseup partecipano a questa campagna?
Noi pensiamo che probabilmente significa che è molto difficile sottrarsi completamente alla sorveglianza del capitalismo. Noi abbiamo deciso di prendere parte a questa campagna perché vogliamo dare ai nostri utenti la possibilità di raddoppiare le loro donazioni. Allo stesso tempo, pensiamo anche che sia importante che voi conosciate il contesto e le conseguenze che ci sono dietro le piattaforme tecnologiche sulle quali fate affidamento.
Se l'enorme database nel cloud che traccia i tuoi movimenti online non ti spaventa troppo, allora per favore fai in modo che la tua donazione raddoppi contribuendo qui: Altrimenti considera che puoi anche donare direttamente su Riseup: Ci sono anche alcune mezze misure tecniche che puoi adottare per limitare il tracciamento che siti come CrowdRise sono in grado di fare. Vedi la nostra pagina "Better Web Browsing" per dettagli [4]. Questi accorgimenti non colpiscono direttamente i dati raccolti da CrowdRise o dalle compagnie delle carte di credito, ma possono aiutarti a rilasciare meno dati a numerosi trackers che cercano di costruire un profilo completo riguardo i tuoi comportamenti.
Con amore,
Gli uccelli di Riseup

Want to Listen to Police Scanners?  Cops Say No More
Police move to block the public from listening to scanners
By Zusha Elinson  May 17, 2018 8:00 a.m. ET
A report of a suspicious person crackled from John Messner's
RadioShack police scanner, one of two he keeps at his home in
Knoxville, Tenn.
When an officer was heard yelling "Shots fired!" minutes later, Mr.
Messner knew it was time to go.  The 52-year-old construction worker
and photographer grabbed his two cameras, his portable scanner, jumped
in his 1999 Plymouth Voyager minivan, and raced to the scene 3 miles
away, where a suspected burglar was shot by police.
"When I got there, the guy was still on the ground, they hadn't put
him in the ambulance yet," said Mr. Messner of the November incident.
"It didn't look like he was dead, but he was definitely hit."
Mr. Messner snapped pictures and posted them on his Knoxville Crime
Facebook group, which has 94,000 members in a city of 186,000.  They
come to see photos, read Mr. Messner's live updates on police chases
and burglaries that he gets from the police scanner, and discuss
neighborhood crime issues.
Social-media groups like Knoxville Crime are one reason that Knoxville
police officials say they will begin encrypting police radio
communications in August, making it impossible for the public--and Mr.
Messner--to listen in live.  The move comes as more police departments
around the country are seeking to shield their live radio
communications, now easily accessible via smartphone apps.  Police say
the effort will keep officers safe and bad guys from finding out what
they're doing.
"When you're putting out information that only a suspect and a victim
and an officer knows, then all of the sudden you have someone put that
on social media, that takes your advantage away," said Darrell DeBusk,
a Knoxville police spokesman.
Earlier this year, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department
encrypted its radio traffic, alleging that bad guys "monitor police
radio frequencies in order to better facilitate their crimes and
gather intelligence about the whereabouts of police officers."
Pueblo, Colo., police blocked their scanner traffic recently, citing
suspects using scanner apps to avoid officers.
Local media still has access to the live radio transmissions in Las
Vegas--police allow them to purchase their own radios.  In Knoxville,
the radio traffic will be posted after a one-hour delay, said Mr.
These moves have rankled scanner enthusiasts who range from people
curious about police activity in their neighborhood to modern-day
Weegees, the New York City freelance photographer known for his raw
crime-scene photos.  Many scanner buffs are police supporters who want
to help solve crimes, making the decision to go dark a difficult one,
police officials say.
"It's a tough choice because many of the pro-police people out in the
community who support their local police get that way because they
listen to their police on these scanners or phone apps," said Richard
Myers, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.
Some police departments have found a solution by using encrypted
channels for more sensitive work, such as a SWAT team readying for a
raid, while keeping the more mundane police patrol work on the
publicly available channel, he said.
In Colorado, a push to encrypt police radio traffic inspired a bill
backed by scanner enthusiasts earlier this year that would have banned
encryption, except for sensitive situations.  The bill failed with
strong opposition from law enforcement.
"These are government agents working for the taxpayers and I think
citizens have the right to know what they're doing," said Robert
Wareham, an attorney who helped draft the bill.
Mr. Wareham, a former police officer, said he uses his scanner to find
out about police activity in his neighborhood or on the roads.  "There
are six or seven times a year where I avoid a dangerous situations
where I know what's going on," he said.
In Knoxville, Mr. DeBusk, the police spokesman, said the prevalence of
smartphone apps that broadcast police communications, such as
Broadcastify, has made it easier for criminals to listen in.
"You've always had people that had scanners, but it was not as common
as the smartphone apps," said Mr. DeBusk.  "We actually have arrested
people, they've had the smartphone on them and we could hear our own
dispatchers, the sound coming from their smartphone."
Lindsay Blanton, the CEO of Broadcastify's parent company
RadioReference.com, called this an "overdone complaint."  The
approximately 200,000 daily unique listeners tuning in to
Broadcastify's 6,600 feeds typically hear police communications on a
45 second to three minute delay and the company bans sensitive
content, he said.
"It's providing more an entertainment type perspective than the
ability to gain an advantage over law enforcement," said Mr. Blanton
People can listen to public safety, aircraft, rail and marine audio
streams from across the country on Broadcastify.  The company relies
on volunteers who send local feeds from their scanners and in some
cases police departments who do the same because "there are a lot of
agencies that value the general public being more involved," said Mr.
Mr. Messner, of the Knoxville Crime Facebook group, said he thinks
city officials don't like the pressure that the group puts on them to
deal with crime in the city.
Cutting off the scanner will cut off Mr. Messner's access to the
subjects of his photographs, some of which have made news themselves.
Back in 2014, he went to the scene of unruly college party and
photographed a Knox County Sheriff's deputy with his hands around the
throat of handcuffed college student.  The deputy was fired over the
incident, but then allowed to retire.
"I was at the right place at the right time," he said.  "I listened to
the scanner and I heard things escalating."

I just got a voicemail from one special agent Delligan (sp? And why are they almost always Irish?) in DC about a 'post you made in April', and he wanted a callback. On calling I got a voicemail box that sounded legit but I still suspected a FB phishing expedition. So I dialed the same number but instead of the last 2 digits I dialed 00... Fast busy. So I dial 01, and get a senator's office. Not a Phishing trip... I left a rather rude voicemail at the phone number and got a callback about 10 minutes later.
The post in question, from April was in regard to the Congressional Baseball game, which had a shooter drop in if you'll recall. My post was just before they tried have their ballgame again and RollCall was commenting on the security. In the post I basically suggested that there's no foolproof way to protect a congressman on an open air ballfield from a sniper at 300 yard with a bolt action rifle. Apparently the Capitol Police ARE worried about such a possibility and were 'assessing' all possible threat scenarios made on social media. After a five minute chat he assumed I wasn't intending to be a 'shooter' nor instructing anyone how to be one, or even suggesting anyone should be one, and here is the post:
"I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel's worth, banks are going bust, shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it.
We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, and we sit watching our TV's while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be. We know things are bad - worse than bad. They're crazy.
It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, 'Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.'
Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get mad! I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to riot - I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
All I know is that first you've got to get mad!"

"Encrypt or scramble your comms." This is what the FCC tells them every time a police agency or one of their representative orgs ask for laws making it illegal to listen to their comms, because the Communications Act of 1932 "protects" them by making it a federal felony to use any information heard in the commission of a crime and it's also a crime to pass on the info.

Want to Listen to Police Scanners?  Cops Say No More
Police move to block the public from listening to scanners
By Zusha Elinson  May 17, 2018 8:00 a.m. ET
A report of a suspicious person crackled from John Messner's
RadioShack police scanner, one of two he keeps at his home in
Knoxville, Tenn.
When an officer was heard yelling "Shots fired!" minutes later, Mr.
Messner knew it was time to go.  The 52-year-old construction worker
and photographer grabbed his two cameras, his portable scanner, jumped
in his 1999 Plymouth Voyager minivan, and raced to the scene 3 miles
away, where a suspected burglar was shot by police.
"When I got there, the guy was still on the ground, they hadn't put
him in the ambulance yet," said Mr. Messner of the November incident.
"It didn't look like he was dead, but he was definitely hit."
Mr. Messner snapped pictures and posted them on his Knoxville Crime
Facebook group, which has 94,000 members in a city of 186,000.  They
come to see photos, read Mr. Messner's live updates on police chases
and burglaries that he gets from the police scanner, and discuss
neighborhood crime issues.
Social-media groups like Knoxville Crime are one reason that Knoxville
police officials say they will begin encrypting police radio
communications in August, making it impossible for the public--and Mr.
Messner--to listen in live.  The move comes as more police departments
around the country are seeking to shield their live radio
communications, now easily accessible via smartphone apps.  Police say
the effort will keep officers safe and bad guys from finding out what
they're doing.
"When you're putting out information that only a suspect and a victim
and an officer knows, then all of the sudden you have someone put that
on social media, that takes your advantage away," said Darrell DeBusk,
a Knoxville police spokesman.
Earlier this year, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department
encrypted its radio traffic, alleging that bad guys "monitor police
radio frequencies in order to better facilitate their crimes and
gather intelligence about the whereabouts of police officers."
Pueblo, Colo., police blocked their scanner traffic recently, citing
suspects using scanner apps to avoid officers.
Local media still has access to the live radio transmissions in Las
Vegas--police allow them to purchase their own radios.  In Knoxville,
the radio traffic will be posted after a one-hour delay, said Mr.
These moves have rankled scanner enthusiasts who range from people
curious about police activity in their neighborhood to modern-day
Weegees, the New York City freelance photographer known for his raw
crime-scene photos.  Many scanner buffs are police supporters who want
to help solve crimes, making the decision to go dark a difficult one,
police officials say.
"It's a tough choice because many of the pro-police people out in the
community who support their local police get that way because they
listen to their police on these scanners or phone apps," said Richard
Myers, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.
Some police departments have found a solution by using encrypted
channels for more sensitive work, such as a SWAT team readying for a
raid, while keeping the more mundane police patrol work on the
publicly available channel, he said.
In Colorado, a push to encrypt police radio traffic inspired a bill
backed by scanner enthusiasts earlier this year that would have banned
encryption, except for sensitive situations.  The bill failed with
strong opposition from law enforcement.
"These are government agents working for the taxpayers and I think
citizens have the right to know what they're doing," said Robert
Wareham, an attorney who helped draft the bill.
Mr. Wareham, a former police officer, said he uses his scanner to find
out about police activity in his neighborhood or on the roads.  "There
are six or seven times a year where I avoid a dangerous situations
where I know what's going on," he said.
In Knoxville, Mr. DeBusk, the police spokesman, said the prevalence of
smartphone apps that broadcast police communications, such as
Broadcastify, has made it easier for criminals to listen in.
"You've always had people that had scanners, but it was not as common
as the smartphone apps," said Mr. DeBusk.  "We actually have arrested
people, they've had the smartphone on them and we could hear our own
dispatchers, the sound coming from their smartphone."
Lindsay Blanton, the CEO of Broadcastify's parent company
RadioReference.com, called this an "overdone complaint."  The
approximately 200,000 daily unique listeners tuning in to
Broadcastify's 6,600 feeds typically hear police communications on a
45 second to three minute delay and the company bans sensitive
content, he said.
"It's providing more an entertainment type perspective than the
ability to gain an advantage over law enforcement," said Mr. Blanton
People can listen to public safety, aircraft, rail and marine audio
streams from across the country on Broadcastify.  The company relies
on volunteers who send local feeds from their scanners and in some
cases police departments who do the same because "there are a lot of
agencies that value the general public being more involved," said Mr.
Mr. Messner, of the Knoxville Crime Facebook group, said he thinks
city officials don't like the pressure that the group puts on them to
deal with crime in the city.
Cutting off the scanner will cut off Mr. Messner's access to the
subjects of his photographs, some of which have made news themselves.
Back in 2014, he went to the scene of unruly college party and
photographed a Knox County Sheriff's deputy with his hands around the
throat of handcuffed college student.  The deputy was fired over the
incident, but then allowed to retire.
"I was at the right place at the right time," he said.  "I listened to
the scanner and I heard things escalating."

@_subject: Razer gets a call from the fedz about a ZuckerBook 'post you made in 
I just got a voicemail from one special agent Delligan (sp? And why are they almost always Irish?) in DC about a 'post you made in April', and he wanted a callback. On calling I got a voicemail box that sounded legit but I still suspected a FB phishing expedition. So I dialed the same number but instead of the last 2 digits I dialed 00... Fast busy. So I dial 01, and get a senator's office. Not a Phishing trip... I left a rather rude voicemail at the phone number and got a callback about 10 minutes later.
The post in question, from April was in regard to the Congressional Baseball game, which had a shooter drop in if you'll recall. My post was just before they tried have their ballgame again and RollCall was commenting on the security. In the post I basically suggested that there's no foolproof way to protect a congressman on an open air ballfield from a sniper at 300 yard with a bolt action rifle. Apparently the Capitol Police ARE worried about such a possibility and were 'assessing' all possible threat scenarios made on social media. After a five minute chat he assumed I wasn't intending to be a 'shooter' nor instructing anyone how to be one, or even suggesting anyone should be one, and here is the post:
"I don't have to tell you things are bad. Everybody knows things are bad. It's a depression. Everybody's out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel's worth, banks are going bust, shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street and there's nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there's no end to it.
We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, and we sit watching our TV's while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that's the way it's supposed to be. We know things are bad - worse than bad. They're crazy.
It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and all we say is, 'Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone.'
Well, I'm not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get mad! I don't want you to protest. I don't want you to riot - I don't want you to write to your congressman because I wouldn't know what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
All I know is that first you've got to get mad!"

Totalitarian collectivism isn't communism
Vietnamese Bloodbath... You mean in Cambodia? Because nothing of the sort happened in Vietnam that's ever been documented anywhere.
As far as Cambodia goes, that "Bloodbath" committed  by the Vietnamese, IF if ever actually occured, would be their wiping out of left-behind and indigenous CIA proxies. Much like the Syrians, with Russian assistance, are doing to another group of CIA proxies.
If it was societal 'Familcide', it was the CIA's proxies killing off anyone who disagreed with them. The Khmer Rouge weren't "Left", and no one I ever met thought they were, so you and your Scumbag alt-right friends, and Westerners indoctrinated into the myth of Merica, believe that garbage... Sort of  like believing in Chemtrails distributed by commercial airliners, or Russians in the hotel room with Donald Trump, pissing on him.

@_subject: Personal Black Box? 
Jm Bell:
That explains alot... Just sayin' ... the popofeds are really keystone kops, but everyone attributes them superhuman capabilities, b/c TV, the most insidious indoctrination device ever created.
How many times has the FBI been reamed in the last decade alone for shoddy lab work and conditions? They have to literally create terrorist orgs using people who can only be described as mentally insufficient to do that. 
 and am now up to Season 4 of Criminal Minds.  Naturally, this induces a bit of what I'll call cinematic paranoia.   In what seems to be a majority of episodes, a victim gets attacked, usually ends up dead, and the plucky investigators are stuck trying to figure out what happened.  Naturally, they usually do, but only after about 45 minutes of high-tension showtime.  It occurs to me that what people may need, for physical security, would be what might be called a "personal black box", analogous to an airplane flight recorder.  Or, a civilian version of a cop's body-cam.
  Any modern smartphone would have the basics of such a device:  A high-resolution camera, microphone, and a huge amount of storage.  And a quick 911-call if necessary.  The mere possession and use of such a device would probably deter the large majority of potential attackers.  And even if it does not completely protect a given user, it would allow far more easy identification of the perpetrator.    Parts of this, of course, are not a new idea.
                     
However, storage is not enough:  In use, in some instances, an attacker would presumably be aware enough to take or break the device, so some sort of continuous or discontinuous upload of the data could be done, to be available no matter what else happens.  Say, a frame per second when nothing seems to be happening, and a greater rate when triggered somehow.  Could a heart-rate monitor be employed, sensed one axis of the phone's accelerometers?  Or if the wearer falls down?  Or if a sufficiently-loud noise is heard, etc.  Or if a trigger-word is spoken a la Siri?  
Can the data transfer be made economical?  Even an average of 1 megabit/second would be over one gigabyte during a 3 hour usage per day.  That's substantially greater than most people currently use.  One possibility is that the phone could upload the data to the cell phone company, where it could be "parked" for a few seconds or minutes.  If nothing happens to the phone to cause a trigger (some sort of attack) the phone could instruct the cell phone company to abandon the data.  Conversely, if a trigger occurs, the cell phone company would move 100% of the data to a backup system for later retrieval.  Presumably, the cell phone company would offer discounted rates for such transfers, and only offer that service if the local service is sufficiently unloaded at that moment.

Jm Bell:
That explains alot... Just sayin' ... the popofeds are really keystone kops, but everyone attributes them superhuman capabilities, b/c TV, the most insidious indoctrination device ever created.
How many times has the FBI been reamed in the last decade alone for shoddy lab work and conditions? They have to literally create terrorist orgs using people who can only be described as mentally insufficient to do that. 
 and am now up to Season 4 of Criminal Minds.  Naturally, this induces a bit of what I'll call cinematic paranoia.   In what seems to be a majority of episodes, a victim gets attacked, usually ends up dead, and the plucky investigators are stuck trying to figure out what happened.  Naturally, they usually do, but only after about 45 minutes of high-tension showtime.  It occurs to me that what people may need, for physical security, would be what might be called a "personal black box", analogous to an airplane flight recorder.  Or, a civilian version of a cop's body-cam.
  Any modern smartphone would have the basics of such a device:  A high-resolution camera, microphone, and a huge amount of storage.  And a quick 911-call if necessary.  The mere possession and use of such a device would probably deter the large majority of potential attackers.  And even if it does not completely protect a given user, it would allow far more easy identification of the perpetrator.    Parts of this, of course, are not a new idea.
                     
However, storage is not enough:  In use, in some instances, an attacker would presumably be aware enough to take or break the device, so some sort of continuous or discontinuous upload of the data could be done, to be available no matter what else happens.  Say, a frame per second when nothing seems to be happening, and a greater rate when triggered somehow.  Could a heart-rate monitor be employed, sensed one axis of the phone's accelerometers?  Or if the wearer falls down?  Or if a sufficiently-loud noise is heard, etc.  Or if a trigger-word is spoken a la Siri?  
Can the data transfer be made economical?  Even an average of 1 megabit/second would be over one gigabyte during a 3 hour usage per day.  That's substantially greater than most people currently use.  One possibility is that the phone could upload the data to the cell phone company, where it could be "parked" for a few seconds or minutes.  If nothing happens to the phone to cause a trigger (some sort of attack) the phone could instruct the cell phone company to abandon the data.  Conversely, if a trigger occurs, the cell phone company would move 100% of the data to a backup system for later retrieval.  Presumably, the cell phone company would offer discounted rates for such transfers, and only offer that service if the local service is sufficiently unloaded at that moment.

Evidently these messages went to you and was handled correctly, but were never posted to the cypherpunks at lists.cpunks.org list.
If anyone thinks messages *were* posted but *were not* archived at the link above, please let me know and I can dig into some log files.
Yes.  Mailman rejects a few things silently, but mostly people should get a bounce if a message is not accepted for the list.  If anyone spots anomalies, let me know and I can take a closer look at the list config.
I believe it's safe to "Cc: cypherpunks at lists.cpunks.org" but not "Bcc: cypherpunks at lists.cpunks.org"
Also Mailman has a threshold for how many addresses may be included in To: and Cc: before flagging for the moderator (me).  This hasn't happened recently.
I noticed this whole series of messages seems to be archived correctly, which indicates that at least some things are currently working correctly.

I'll take a Persian scholar's word for it over a fucking google search.
So I did a quickie.
Leads to Who resided in East Arabia... Right next door to Iran.
Eastern Arabia was historically known as Bahrain (Arabic: البحرين‎)
until the 18th century. This region stretched from the south of Basra
along the Persian Gulf coast and included the regions of Bahrain,
Kuwait, Al-Hasa, Qatif, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Southern Iraq, and
Northern Oman. The entire coastal strip of Eastern Arabia was known as
“Bahrain” for ten centuries.[1]
Until very recently, the whole of Eastern Arabia, from southern Iraq to
the mountains of Oman, was a place where people moved around, settled
and married unconcerned by national borders.[1]
I'll take that as proof of Cole's statement, stupid.

Sender filters").  Such messages will now instead be rejected.  So, people who post from an address that is not subscribed will get a message that the list is for subscribers only.  Certainly this is the expected behavior, rather than messages being accepted and then silently dropped.
It's not immediately clear to me whether I twiddled this setting myself, when we moved the lists, or this was already the setting from the old site when Riad managed the list.  Mea culpa, if I'm the guilty party.  I hope this config change addresses the anomalies that people have spotted recently, with some messages that appeared to be accepted for posting, but never got posted or archived.
Thanks for sending the full headers and other details shortly after the mishap.  That made it very easy to verify that Postfix/postgrey/etc. received the message properly and provided it to Mailman, but then Mailman didn't post it.  Best regards to all,

Thanks for this. I was a machinist but not a foundry worker and never knew the specifics. I WOULD add that that wind speed mentioned is SERIOUSLY underestimated. The WTC was at the absolutely windiest spot on Manhattan and even on a calm windless day at ground level the wind at the top of the building is probably higher than 20mph.

Flame temperature was probably about 600-700 C.
Comparatively low temperature, but still plenty hot. It would have set everything which would burn in probably the entire floorspace on fire - I doubt any partition walls would have survived the impact and initial fuel/air fireball blast.
2nd stage: After the jet fuel burned away, the contents of the offices and the aircraft began burning. The smoke cleared a bit, there was proportionally more air in the fuel/air mix, and carbon started burning to CO2 rather than CO. Flame temperature around 900-1,000C.
3rd stage: Many of the windows were gone, and there was a wind of about 10-20mph. This made a through draft from the windward side of the buildings to the downwind sides. As the air passed through, it heated, and got lighter - the lighter air rushed out the downwind side, increasing the draft a little.
In terms of the rate the fire was producing it (a bit over a gigawatt), the space was pretty well-insulated against loss of heat: partly by its shape, partly by the concrete floor and roof. The heat would build up A prolonged fire with good insulation and draft can increase the flame temperature in the center to maybe 1,250C. [1]
We know the fires hadn't run out of fuel when the buildings collapsed because we could see the flames inside the windward side - the place with the best air supply, and therefore the place which would run out of fuel first.

After Mysterious Closure, Solar Observatory In New Mexico Reopens : NPR
Laurel Wamsley
A solar observatory in New Mexico reopened Monday after being closed by authorities for 10 days — which spawned national interest and speculation into the cause of its evacuation.
Let's get this out of the way: Scientists say that aliens were not involved.
On Sept. 6, the Sunspot Solar Observatory was suddenly closed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, the consortium that operates it, without public explanation.
People who work at the observatory, and those who live on the site, were asked to evacuate. The site's post office was also closed.
The Otero County sheriff told the local newspaper that his office was alerted but not given any information.
"The FBI is refusing to tell us what's going on," Sheriff Benny House told the Alamogordo Daily News shortly after the closure. "We've got people up there (at Sunspot) that requested us to standby while they evacuate it. Nobody would really elaborate on any of the circumstances as to why. The FBI were up there. What their purpose was nobody will say."
"But for the FBI to get involved that quick and be so secretive about it, there was a lot of stuff going on up there," he added. "There was a Blackhawk helicopter, a bunch of people around antennas and work crews on towers but nobody would tell us anything."
From there, it was off to the races. Combine the FBI, a powerful telescope and a location in rural Sunspot, N.M., and you've got all the ingredients for some rampant speculation — government surveillance, aliens, etc.
"Why the FBI close the observatory?? People have the right to know!!" one person demanded on the observatory's Google page.
The observatory, in Lincoln National Forest, about 170 miles south of Albuquerque, is home to the Dunn Solar Telescope. When it opened in 1969, it was the world's premier high spatial resolution optical solar telescope, the National Solar Observatory says. Though it's now considered a "legacy telescope," the Dunn "continues to be one of the most versatile, user-friendly setups in the world," the observatory says.
New Mexico is already associated in some people's minds with unexplained phenomena. The observatory is about 85 miles southwest of Roswell, N.M., a town long at the center of UFO lore.
So what did happen at Sunspot?
A security threat, though the specific nature of that threat remains unclear. According to a statement from AURA, the consortium and the National Science Foundation decided to vacate the site temporarily because of a security issue:
    "AURA has been cooperating with an on-going law enforcement investigation of criminal activity that occurred at Sacramento Peak. During this time, we became concerned that a suspect in the investigation potentially posed a threat to the safety of local staff and residents. For this reason, AURA temporarily vacated the facility and ceased science activities at this location.
    "The decision to vacate was based on the logistical challenges associated with protecting personnel at such a remote location, and the need for expeditious response to the potential threat. AURA determined that moving the small number of on-site staff and residents off the mountain was the most prudent and effective action to ensure their safety."
The consortium said that it recognizes that the lack of communication while the facility was being evacuated was "concerning and frustrating for some."
"However, our desire to provide additional information had to be balanced against the risk that, if spread at the time, the news would alert the suspect and impede the law enforcement investigation. That was a risk we could not take," the statement says.
And the helicopter? House, the sheriff, told The Washington Post that Black Hawk helicopters aren't uncommon in the area.
A call to an FBI spokesperson was not immediately returned. A person at the bureau's Albuquerque office said he had no information and could not comment.
The consortium said the site will have extra security for now, because of people showing up at the facility since its closure: "Given the significant amount of publicity the temporary closure has generated, and the consequent expectation of an unusual number of visitors to the site, we are temporarily engaging a security service while the facility returns to a normal working environment."
James McAteer, the New Mexico State University professor who leads operations of the telescope at the site, said he was impressed by the theories that people had come up with for the closure.
"It was the first time I've had to deny contact with Aliens and Death-by-solar-storm and underground tunnels and New communications via X-rays all at one time," he wrote in an email to NPR.
The observatory's reopening means that researchers can get to back to doing what they do: staring at the sun.
"We cannot wait to get back to work to show everyone the world class research we do every day at the telescope," McAteer said.
NPR's Emily Sullivan contributed to this report.

Maybe being kicked out so often has resulted in their group survival.

@_subject: Unz Review: The Vineyard Saker re: Nazi on Christian action in Ukraine 
The abomination of desolation standing in the holy place
The Saker
28 Sept 2018
Warning: the following text was written specifically to help Christians make sense of the “hijacked vocabulary” used in the discussion of the current attempts by the Empire to take control of the Orthodox people of the Ukraine. For atheists/agnostics this discussion will offer just some irrelevant and boring mumbo-jumbo with no relevance to the lofty realms of enlightened modern positivism.
The latest move by the Anglo-Zionist Empire in the Ukraine is truly an exceptionally ugly and dangerous one: it appears that the Patriarch of Constantinople will soon grant its full independence to the so-called “Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate”. This move is openly directed against the current biggest ecclesiastical body in the Ukraine the “Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate” and it will almost certainly lead to bloodshed and massacres similar to what took place in Odessa on May 2nd 2014: the Ukronazis will use force (riot police or even Nazi death squads) to forcibly seize the churches, cathedrals, monasteries and other buildings and properties currently owned by the Moscow Patriarchate.
There are many articles written about this development, but almost all of them are written from a secular point of view, even when written by supposedly Christian or Orthodox authors. The paradoxical element here is that a lot of theological terms are used by authors who have only a very vague idea of what these terms really mean. I have no desire to enter into this conversation and use the pseudo-spiritual reference framework typically used by such commentators and what I propose to do today is much more modest: I want to explain the original, Christian, meaning of the terms which are (mis-)used on a daily basis.
The reader will then decide how to apply them, or not, to the current crisis.
I will begin by the very basics.
The basics
The term “Christian” can mean one of two things: first, it can designate any person or group calling itself Christian. When used in this sense, the word “Christian” includes not only the all main Christian denominations, but also Sun Myung Moon’s Unification Church, the Mormons or even the 17% of British Christians who do not believe in the resurrection of Christ. Basically, in this context the term has no objective meaning whatsoever and this is how the term is mostly used nowadays.
There is also another use of the word “Christian”. This second definition is based on two very ancient statements. The first by Saint Athanasius of Alexandria (4th century) and the second one by Saint Vincent of Lérins (5th century). The first one says that the Christian faith is the faith “which the Lord gave, was preached by the Apostles, and was preserved by the Fathers. On this was the Church founded; and if anyone departs from this, he neither is nor any longer ought to be called a Christian“. The second one says that this faith only includes that “which has been believed everywhere, always and by all”. By these definitions, “Christianity” is an objective category not a “free for all”. The key words affirming this are “if anyone departs from this, he neither is nor any longer ought to be called a Christian”. These ancient definition preclude not only any form of dogmatic innovation, they also imply that words can be used either in a truly Christian sense or not. There is no middle-ground here. This belief, which was shared by all the Church Fathers and all the members of the ancient, original, Christian Church has tremendous implications, especially for what is called “ecclesiology”.
The term “ecclesiology” refers to the Christian theology concerning the Church. In other words, the teachings of Christianity about what is, or what is not, the Church (and what is, or is not, within the confines of the Church) is an objective corpus of beliefs, of key tenets, of dogmas.
What I will do next is to explain the meaning of a number of concepts when used in this second, original, context and contrast their original meaning with the basically secular and pseudo-Christian meaning which is so often attributed to them nowadays.
One more thing, for the sake of clarity: I will be writing the word church with a lower case “c” when dealing with a building (as in “the church of Saint Paul in the city’s downtown”) and with a capital “C” when dealing with an ecclesiastical jurisdiction/body (as in the “Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate”); in this latter case the use of the word “Church” with a capital “C” will in no way imply any recognition of legitimacy.
1. Canonical, canonicity and “recognized”
Most authors nowadays speak of a “canonical” Church as being a “recognized” Church. This is a circular definition, by the way: a Church is canonical because it is recognized and it is recognized because it is canonical. This begs the obvious question: recognized by whom?! The answer is also obvious: either recognized by the country’s civil/secular authorities or recognized by other “canonical” Churches.
From a truly Christian point of view, this is utterly absurd. Since when do civil/secular powers have the expertise or, for that matter, the authority to recognize or not recognize Church “A” as “canonical” and Church “B” as “non-canonical”?! And what does “canonical” mean anyway?
“Canonical” simply means “in conformity to the Church canons”. As for the word “canon” it is simply the Greek word for “ruler, measure”. Simply put, something is “canonical” when it is in conformity with the dogmas, rules, decrees, definitions and practices proclaimed and adopted by the Christian Church, primarily by means of decisions by the various recognized Church councils (I won’t go into the issue of what constitutes a recognized council since that will take too much time). You could say that something is canonical if it conforms to the the rules of Saint Athanasius of Alexandria and Saint Vincent of Lérins quoted above. This, again, is an objective category which cannot be twisted and turned into a free for all. So let’s look at one such canons and see what it says. The 31st Apostolic Canon decrees that:
    If any bishop makes use of the rulers of this world, and by their means obtains to be a bishop of a church, let him be deprived and suspended, and all that communicate with him.
This ruling of the apostles themselves has later been recognized and confirmed during an Ecumenical Council. The 3rd Canon of the 7th Ecumenical Council says:
    “Every appointment of a bishop, or of a presbyter, or of a deacon made by (civil) rulers shall remain void in accordance with the Canon which says: “If any bishop comes into possession of a church by employing secular rulers, let him be deposed from office, and let him be excommunicated. And all those who communicate with him too.”
You see the problem now? How can anybody consider that civil/secular authorities are competent to “recognize” this or that Church as “canonical” when the canons of the Apostles and of a Ecumenical Council (the most authoritative Church Council) specifically state that if a bishop has obtains his “legitimacy” (office, rank, diocese or church properties) from civil/secular authorities he should be deposed, thus making him totally illegitimate? From a canonical point of view, the recognition of civil authorities is not only meaningless, it could, depending on the exact circumstances, constitute grounds for deposition!
The reality is that during much of the 20th century what we have seen is the civil/secular authorities of various countries supporting one Church against another for purely political purposes. This was especially prevalent in the Communist countries. Some bishops were considered “friendly” and others “enemies of the people”. The secular authorities then simply used brute force (usually in the form of riot police) to evict the latter and replace them with the former. The “friendly” bishops then took control of all of the churches, monasteries and other properties and declared themselves to be legitimate and canonical because they were recognized and because they were placed in control of a lot of very visible and historical real estate.
Needless to say, that kind of dependence on the goodwill and support of civil/secular authorities placed the “friendly” Churches into a complete subordination to the state, exactly what the civil/secular authorities wanted in the first place. The fact that, unlike in most similar cases before the 20th century, the civil authorities in the 20th century were not only secular, but openly and militantly atheistic created a qualitatively new phenomenon: the subordination of bishops and Churches to the will of anti-religious secular regimes. Nowadays, of course, most governments in nominally Orthodox countries do not declare themselves as militant atheists, but the subordinate relationship of the official “state Churches” to the secular authorities has remained unchanged (even if their official rhetoric has been adapted to the new realities).
The bottom line is this: all this talk about “canonical” and “recognized” Churches is a self-serving canard used by those Churches who have obtained their official status by completely uncanonical means. In the overwhelming number of cases, when individuals or organizations use the term “canonical” they never mean “in conformity to the Church canons” simply because they are both ignorant and indifferent to what the Christian teachings really says about these matters.
2. Bishops, Patriarchs and wannabe “Eastern Popes”
Who is the biggest Ortho-boss, the bishop, or maybe the Archbishop, or the Metropolitan, or the Patriarch? It must be the “Ecumenical” Patriarch, right? Since he is “Ecumenical” he must be like an “Orthodox Pope”. Check out his official title: “His Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome, and Ecumenical Patriarch“. God is, by definition, (only) “divine”. The Third Person of the Trinity is (just) the “Holy” Spirit. But the Patriarch of Constantinople is his “most divine and all-holy”! Wow – he surely must really be some kind of super Ortho-Pope!
There are only four main “ranks” in the Church: faithful, deacon, presbyter and bishop. All the rest are just honorific and/or administrative titles including reader, subdeacon, chanter, acolyte, protodeacon, archdeacon, protopresbyter, archpriest, archimandrite, mitred archpriest, protosyngellos, archbishop, metropolitan and patriarch. The rank of emperor, by the way, was associated with the rank of subdeacon and the emperor would receive the Mysteries (aka “sacraments”, the Eucharist) to the side of the altar with the subdeacons. None of these titles indicate any qualitative difference or mystical superiority.
The Church, while essentially mystical (thus referred to as the “theandric Body of Christ”) also has an administrative/organizational aspect which must exist within the social and political environment of the society in which it operates. For example, while in mystical terms all bishops are equal, it was obvious from the beginning that being the bishop of the imperial city (be it Rome or Constantinople) was a far more important office than being the bishop of some remote and scarcely populated diocese. Furthermore, while all important decisions were made in councils (local or ecumenical) day to day decisions could be made by bishops specially invested with that authority (sometimes assisted by a few more bishops). But except for honorific and administrative reasons, all bishops are fundamentally equals, invested with the same charisma (gift) and authority. The Latin expression primus inter pares, or “first among equals”, expresses this reality.
This also fully applies to the “Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome, and Ecumenical Patriarch” who had a honorific primacy simply because he was the ruling bishop of the capital of the Empire, just as the ruling bishop of Rome (the “Pope” in Latin terminology) had before him. I won’t go into the history of how the (tiny) Patriarchate of Constantinople used its former position to claim some kind of universal jurisdiction, this would take too much time, but I will simply note that two events which occurred on the 15th century have irrevocably made void any and all claims of primacy (even of honor) by the Patriarch of Constantinople: the False Union of Florence in 1439 AD and the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 AD.
    [Sidebar: the Russian Orthodox Church, by the way, could lay claim of being the “Third Rome” as successor to the First and Second Rome since the First Rome fell to the Barbarians in 476 and fell into apostasy in 1054 while the Second Rome fell into apostasy in 1439 and to the Ottomans in 1453. I won’t go into the merits of this argument, but I will just point out that it absolutely infuriates the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The fact that the Russian Orthodox Church is by far the biggest of all and the fact that Moscow and Saint Petersburg were the capitals of the last Orthodox empire only further serves to create tensions, and even outright hostility, between the Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Moscow Patriarchate. This is all very relevant in the case of the current political struggle over the Ukraine and the role of the Patriarch of Constantinople in it].
For all these historical and political arguments, the reality is that the Christian Church has always been conciliar in nature: that is to say that councils (local or major ones) were both the mode and the sole authority by which important decisions could be taken, never any single individual. The example of the Apostolic Council of Jerusalem (in about 50 AD) was the first one to set such an example and it has always been followed by those faithful to the original Christian ecclesiology ever since.
3. The “right” for each country or nation to have its own Church
This is one of the most outlandish and yet also most frequent assertions made by almost every commentator out there: that there is some kind of “right” for each nation or country to have its own, independent, Church. Nothing could be further from the truth!
The reality is that Christianity (like Islam, by the way) absolutely rejects any categories based on ethnicity, race, tribe or anything similar. Here are just a few quotes from the New Testament proving this:
    There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus (Gal 3:28)
    For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one Spirit (Gal 5:6)
    Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God (1 Cor 7:19)
    For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit (1 Cor; 12 :13)
But the clearest and most definitive statement on this issue is this one:
    Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all (Col 3:9-11).
So national/racial/ethnic/tribal categories are lies (contrast that with the racist interpretation of the Scripture by rabbinical phariseism aka modern “Orthodox Judaism”!), becoming a Christian renews your knowledge (that is make you adopt new categories) and in Christ all are one (no more national/racial/ethnic/tribal for true Christians).
This teaching have always remained at the core of the true Christian dogmatic anthropology (i.e. teachings about the nature of man). In fact, what is nowadays called “phyletism” or “ethno-phyletism” (nationalism or tribalism) has been condemned as a heresy by a pan-Orthodox council as late as in 1872 (this council was held in Constantinople, of all places, what sad irony!) For those interested in the historical context for this council, you can download a PDF about it here:     [Sidebar: It is ironical – and sad – that so many of those who today engage in “hunting the Jew” by means of putting silly parentheses around (((names))) and who call themselves Orthodox Christians completely fail to realize two thing: first, they are using categories which the Church has denounced as heresies and, second, they are using the exact same categories as many of the (Orthodox) Jews they are denouncing. Frankly, this is rather pathetic and only goes to show the fantastically low level of spiritual education of those who fancy themselves as “defenders of the Christian faith” and who, in reality, have not even the vaguest basic notions about the faith they pretend to defend]
The truth is that modern national/racial/ethnic/tribal categories are just re-hated pagan categories and that those who use them today, including priests and bishops, are simply catering to the pagan, post-Christian Zeitgeist for petty political reasons. Furthermore, it is also true that since the fall of the last Orthodox Empire in 1917, the Orthodox Church has been undergoing an immense crisis brought along primarily by the infiltration of Greek Orthodox Churches by Freemasons (see here for some background information) and the infiltration of the Russian Orthodox Church by agents of the Bolshevik regime in Russia (see here and here for some background information). The combined effects of these three phenomena (1917 Revolution, Masonic and Bolshevik infiltration) has resulted in a deep crisis from which most Orthodox Churches have yet to recover and which often makes them easy pawns in political battles (I discussed this issue in some detail in my article “Why Orthodox Churches Are Still Used as Pawns in Political Games”).
As for rank and file Orthodox Christians, they are sometimes induced to come to the wrong conclusions about this because they believe (correctly) that, unlike the Latin Papacy, the Orthodox Church does not have one single super-boss and one single administration. They also believe (correctly) that, unlike the Latin Papacy of the past, the Orthodox Church did not have a single “official” language of worship and that, in fact, Orthodox ritual practice is rather diverse and often includes local cultural influences. These correct beliefs, however, bring them to the entirely false conclusion that each Orthodox nation has some kind of “right” to have its own independent (“autocephalous”) Orthodox Church.
The fact that much of the clergy of the “official” and “recognized” (that is “state approved” vide supra) Orthodox Churches is more than happy to comfort them in these beliefs does not help.
As for the secular leaders of the state, they are more than happy to have an Orthodox Church which is both 1) totally compliant and 2) nationalistic.
What is lost in all this madness is the Orthodox truth, the wordview of the true, original, Christianity, and the “spirit of the Fathers” (or phronema in Greek) which best expresses it. It is also no wonder that the most corrupt Orthodox hierarchs, like the Patriarch of Constantinople, are more than happy to pretend that Orthodox ecclesiology does somehow grant them the authority of some kind of “Eastern Pope”.
This is truly the “abomination of desolation standing in the holy place” (Matt 24:15 & Daniel 9:27)!
Those Orthodox Christians who nowadays succumb to the heresy of ethno-phyletism would do well to remember that besides the, shall we say, “geographical” meaning of the words of Christ (in reference to Jerusalem, of course, but also Rome, Constantinople, Moscow, Kiev and many other cities), there is also a second, spiritual meaning well explained by Saint Maximos the Confessor:
    “From the passions embedded in the soul the demons take their starting base to stir up passionate thought in us. Then, by making war on the mind through them they force it to go along and consent to sin. When it is overcome they lead it on to a sin of thought, and when this is accomplished they finally bring it as a prisoner to the deed. After this, at length, the demons who have devastated the soul through thoughts withdraw with them. In the mind there remains only the idol of sin and which the Lord says, “When you see the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place, let him who reads understand.” Man’s mind is a holy place and a temple of God in which the demons have laid waste the soul through passionate thoughts and set up the idol of sin. That these things have already happened in history no one who has read Josephus can, I think, doubt, though some say that these things will also happen when the Antichrist comes.”(2nd Century on Love, Here we have arguably one of the greatest Christian theologians and philosophers of all times reminding us that the “abomination of desolation” will also happen in the minds of those who, suaded by demons and passions, stray away from that “which has been believed everywhere, always and by all” and, instead, let their minds and souls be polluted by the post-Christian nonsense of modern nationalisms. Nationalism, of course, is not only an modern idol, but it is also a rather crude form of self-worship, yet another truly satanic practice!
Conclusion: what this is all about and we can can do about it
The first sad reality is that none of this is about Christianity, Orthodoxy, ecclesiology or anything else remotely connected to any notion of truth at all.
This is about buildings, real-estate, political power, money, influence, indoctrination and all the other key “values” of our times.
The second sad reality is that innocent and well-intentioned people will suffer and even die as a direct consequence of the immoral actions of a few power-greedy individuals.
The truth is that a religion-fulled civil war appears to have already been set in motion and that there is nothing we, simple rank and file Christians, can do about it, at least not in secular terms. In spiritual terms, we can do two things: we can, of course, pray and we can refuse to become part of a debate in which every single concept dear to us is misused, distorted and perverted. For that, we need to understand that the abomination which is taking place before our eyes did not just pop-up into existence ex nihilo and that there are profound spiritual roots to the almost universal adoption of non-Christian categories by most, albeit not all, Christians. Christ Himself reminded us that “If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you” (John 15:9). We also know that the wisdom of this world is “foolishness with God” (1 Cor 3:19) and that it comes “not come from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic” (James 3:15). Then how can we then still operate by using worldly categories or worldly interpretations of patristic concepts?
What we can, and must, do is follow Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s famous appeal and “live not by lies” even if most of our contemporaries, including many Christians (even clerics!) have given up on the very notion of “truth”. In Solzhenitsyn’s words “So in our timidity, let each of us make a choice: whether consciously, to remain a servant of falsehood — of course, it is not out of inclination, but to feed one’s family, that one raises his children in the spirit of lies — or to shrug off the lies and become an honest person worthy of respect both by one’s children and contemporaries”.
After all, if we are truly Christians, then we can remember Christ’s promise that “blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled” (Matt 5:6) and, hopefully, this will give us courage to “stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle” (2 Thess 2:15).

The abomination of desolation standing in the holy place
The Saker
28 Sept 2018
Warning: the following text was written specifically to help Christians make sense of the “hijacked vocabulary” used in the discussion of the current attempts by the Empire to take control of the Orthodox people of the Ukraine. For atheists/agnostics this discussion will offer just some irrelevant and boring mumbo-jumbo with no relevance to the lofty realms of enlightened modern positivism.
The latest move by the Anglo-Zionist Empire in the Ukraine is truly an exceptionally ugly and dangerous one: it appears that the Patriarch of Constantinople will soon grant its full independence to the so-called “Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate”. This move is openly directed against the current biggest ecclesiastical body in the Ukraine the “Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate” and it will almost certainly lead to bloodshed and massacres similar to what took place in Odessa on May 2nd 2014: the Ukronazis will use force (riot police or even Nazi death squads) to forcibly seize the churches, cathedrals, monasteries and other buildings and properties currently owned by the Moscow Patriarchate.
There are many articles written about this development, but almost all of them are written from a secular point of view, even when written by supposedly Christian or Orthodox authors. The paradoxical element here is that a lot of theological terms are used by authors who have only a very vague idea of what these terms really mean. I have no desire to enter into this conversation and use the pseudo-spiritual reference framework typically used by such commentators and what I propose to do today is much more modest: I want to explain the original, Christian, meaning of the terms which are (mis-)used on a daily basis.
The reader will then decide how to apply them, or not, to the current crisis.
I will begin by the very basics.
The basics
The term “Christian” can mean one of two things: first, it can designate any person or group calling itself Christian. When used in this sense, the word “Christian” includes not only the all main Christian denominations, but also Sun Myung Moon’s Unification Church, the Mormons or even the 17% of British Christians who do not believe in the resurrection of Christ. Basically, in this context the term has no objective meaning whatsoever and this is how the term is mostly used nowadays.
There is also another use of the word “Christian”. This second definition is based on two very ancient statements. The first by Saint Athanasius of Alexandria (4th century) and the second one by Saint Vincent of Lérins (5th century). The first one says that the Christian faith is the faith “which the Lord gave, was preached by the Apostles, and was preserved by the Fathers. On this was the Church founded; and if anyone departs from this, he neither is nor any longer ought to be called a Christian“. The second one says that this faith only includes that “which has been believed everywhere, always and by all”. By these definitions, “Christianity” is an objective category not a “free for all”. The key words affirming this are “if anyone departs from this, he neither is nor any longer ought to be called a Christian”. These ancient definition preclude not only any form of dogmatic innovation, they also imply that words can be used either in a truly Christian sense or not. There is no middle-ground here. This belief, which was shared by all the Church Fathers and all the members of the ancient, original, Christian Church has tremendous implications, especially for what is called “ecclesiology”.
The term “ecclesiology” refers to the Christian theology concerning the Church. In other words, the teachings of Christianity about what is, or what is not, the Church (and what is, or is not, within the confines of the Church) is an objective corpus of beliefs, of key tenets, of dogmas.
What I will do next is to explain the meaning of a number of concepts when used in this second, original, context and contrast their original meaning with the basically secular and pseudo-Christian meaning which is so often attributed to them nowadays.
One more thing, for the sake of clarity: I will be writing the word church with a lower case “c” when dealing with a building (as in “the church of Saint Paul in the city’s downtown”) and with a capital “C” when dealing with an ecclesiastical jurisdiction/body (as in the “Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate”); in this latter case the use of the word “Church” with a capital “C” will in no way imply any recognition of legitimacy.
1. Canonical, canonicity and “recognized”
Most authors nowadays speak of a “canonical” Church as being a “recognized” Church. This is a circular definition, by the way: a Church is canonical because it is recognized and it is recognized because it is canonical. This begs the obvious question: recognized by whom?! The answer is also obvious: either recognized by the country’s civil/secular authorities or recognized by other “canonical” Churches.
From a truly Christian point of view, this is utterly absurd. Since when do civil/secular powers have the expertise or, for that matter, the authority to recognize or not recognize Church “A” as “canonical” and Church “B” as “non-canonical”?! And what does “canonical” mean anyway?
“Canonical” simply means “in conformity to the Church canons”. As for the word “canon” it is simply the Greek word for “ruler, measure”. Simply put, something is “canonical” when it is in conformity with the dogmas, rules, decrees, definitions and practices proclaimed and adopted by the Christian Church, primarily by means of decisions by the various recognized Church councils (I won’t go into the issue of what constitutes a recognized council since that will take too much time). You could say that something is canonical if it conforms to the the rules of Saint Athanasius of Alexandria and Saint Vincent of Lérins quoted above. This, again, is an objective category which cannot be twisted and turned into a free for all. So let’s look at one such canons and see what it says. The 31st Apostolic Canon decrees that:
    If any bishop makes use of the rulers of this world, and by their means obtains to be a bishop of a church, let him be deprived and suspended, and all that communicate with him.
This ruling of the apostles themselves has later been recognized and confirmed during an Ecumenical Council. The 3rd Canon of the 7th Ecumenical Council says:
    “Every appointment of a bishop, or of a presbyter, or of a deacon made by (civil) rulers shall remain void in accordance with the Canon which says: “If any bishop comes into possession of a church by employing secular rulers, let him be deposed from office, and let him be excommunicated. And all those who communicate with him too.”
You see the problem now? How can anybody consider that civil/secular authorities are competent to “recognize” this or that Church as “canonical” when the canons of the Apostles and of a Ecumenical Council (the most authoritative Church Council) specifically state that if a bishop has obtains his “legitimacy” (office, rank, diocese or church properties) from civil/secular authorities he should be deposed, thus making him totally illegitimate? From a canonical point of view, the recognition of civil authorities is not only meaningless, it could, depending on the exact circumstances, constitute grounds for deposition!
The reality is that during much of the 20th century what we have seen is the civil/secular authorities of various countries supporting one Church against another for purely political purposes. This was especially prevalent in the Communist countries. Some bishops were considered “friendly” and others “enemies of the people”. The secular authorities then simply used brute force (usually in the form of riot police) to evict the latter and replace them with the former. The “friendly” bishops then took control of all of the churches, monasteries and other properties and declared themselves to be legitimate and canonical because they were recognized and because they were placed in control of a lot of very visible and historical real estate.
Needless to say, that kind of dependence on the goodwill and support of civil/secular authorities placed the “friendly” Churches into a complete subordination to the state, exactly what the civil/secular authorities wanted in the first place. The fact that, unlike in most similar cases before the 20th century, the civil authorities in the 20th century were not only secular, but openly and militantly atheistic created a qualitatively new phenomenon: the subordination of bishops and Churches to the will of anti-religious secular regimes. Nowadays, of course, most governments in nominally Orthodox countries do not declare themselves as militant atheists, but the subordinate relationship of the official “state Churches” to the secular authorities has remained unchanged (even if their official rhetoric has been adapted to the new realities).
The bottom line is this: all this talk about “canonical” and “recognized” Churches is a self-serving canard used by those Churches who have obtained their official status by completely uncanonical means. In the overwhelming number of cases, when individuals or organizations use the term “canonical” they never mean “in conformity to the Church canons” simply because they are both ignorant and indifferent to what the Christian teachings really says about these matters.
2. Bishops, Patriarchs and wannabe “Eastern Popes”
Who is the biggest Ortho-boss, the bishop, or maybe the Archbishop, or the Metropolitan, or the Patriarch? It must be the “Ecumenical” Patriarch, right? Since he is “Ecumenical” he must be like an “Orthodox Pope”. Check out his official title: “His Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome, and Ecumenical Patriarch“. God is, by definition, (only) “divine”. The Third Person of the Trinity is (just) the “Holy” Spirit. But the Patriarch of Constantinople is his “most divine and all-holy”! Wow – he surely must really be some kind of super Ortho-Pope!
There are only four main “ranks” in the Church: faithful, deacon, presbyter and bishop. All the rest are just honorific and/or administrative titles including reader, subdeacon, chanter, acolyte, protodeacon, archdeacon, protopresbyter, archpriest, archimandrite, mitred archpriest, protosyngellos, archbishop, metropolitan and patriarch. The rank of emperor, by the way, was associated with the rank of subdeacon and the emperor would receive the Mysteries (aka “sacraments”, the Eucharist) to the side of the altar with the subdeacons. None of these titles indicate any qualitative difference or mystical superiority.
The Church, while essentially mystical (thus referred to as the “theandric Body of Christ”) also has an administrative/organizational aspect which must exist within the social and political environment of the society in which it operates. For example, while in mystical terms all bishops are equal, it was obvious from the beginning that being the bishop of the imperial city (be it Rome or Constantinople) was a far more important office than being the bishop of some remote and scarcely populated diocese. Furthermore, while all important decisions were made in councils (local or ecumenical) day to day decisions could be made by bishops specially invested with that authority (sometimes assisted by a few more bishops). But except for honorific and administrative reasons, all bishops are fundamentally equals, invested with the same charisma (gift) and authority. The Latin expression primus inter pares, or “first among equals”, expresses this reality.
This also fully applies to the “Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome, and Ecumenical Patriarch” who had a honorific primacy simply because he was the ruling bishop of the capital of the Empire, just as the ruling bishop of Rome (the “Pope” in Latin terminology) had before him. I won’t go into the history of how the (tiny) Patriarchate of Constantinople used its former position to claim some kind of universal jurisdiction, this would take too much time, but I will simply note that two events which occurred on the 15th century have irrevocably made void any and all claims of primacy (even of honor) by the Patriarch of Constantinople: the False Union of Florence in 1439 AD and the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 AD.
    [Sidebar: the Russian Orthodox Church, by the way, could lay claim of being the “Third Rome” as successor to the First and Second Rome since the First Rome fell to the Barbarians in 476 and fell into apostasy in 1054 while the Second Rome fell into apostasy in 1439 and to the Ottomans in 1453. I won’t go into the merits of this argument, but I will just point out that it absolutely infuriates the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The fact that the Russian Orthodox Church is by far the biggest of all and the fact that Moscow and Saint Petersburg were the capitals of the last Orthodox empire only further serves to create tensions, and even outright hostility, between the Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Moscow Patriarchate. This is all very relevant in the case of the current political struggle over the Ukraine and the role of the Patriarch of Constantinople in it].
For all these historical and political arguments, the reality is that the Christian Church has always been conciliar in nature: that is to say that councils (local or major ones) were both the mode and the sole authority by which important decisions could be taken, never any single individual. The example of the Apostolic Council of Jerusalem (in about 50 AD) was the first one to set such an example and it has always been followed by those faithful to the original Christian ecclesiology ever since.
3. The “right” for each country or nation to have its own Church
This is one of the most outlandish and yet also most frequent assertions made by almost every commentator out there: that there is some kind of “right” for each nation or country to have its own, independent, Church. Nothing could be further from the truth!
The reality is that Christianity (like Islam, by the way) absolutely rejects any categories based on ethnicity, race, tribe or anything similar. Here are just a few quotes from the New Testament proving this:
    There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus (Gal 3:28)
    For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one Spirit (Gal 5:6)
    Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God (1 Cor 7:19)
    For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit (1 Cor; 12 :13)
But the clearest and most definitive statement on this issue is this one:
    Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all (Col 3:9-11).
So national/racial/ethnic/tribal categories are lies (contrast that with the racist interpretation of the Scripture by rabbinical phariseism aka modern “Orthodox Judaism”!), becoming a Christian renews your knowledge (that is make you adopt new categories) and in Christ all are one (no more national/racial/ethnic/tribal for true Christians).
This teaching have always remained at the core of the true Christian dogmatic anthropology (i.e. teachings about the nature of man). In fact, what is nowadays called “phyletism” or “ethno-phyletism” (nationalism or tribalism) has been condemned as a heresy by a pan-Orthodox council as late as in 1872 (this council was held in Constantinople, of all places, what sad irony!) For those interested in the historical context for this council, you can download a PDF about it here:     [Sidebar: It is ironical – and sad – that so many of those who today engage in “hunting the Jew” by means of putting silly parentheses around (((names))) and who call themselves Orthodox Christians completely fail to realize two thing: first, they are using categories which the Church has denounced as heresies and, second, they are using the exact same categories as many of the (Orthodox) Jews they are denouncing. Frankly, this is rather pathetic and only goes to show the fantastically low level of spiritual education of those who fancy themselves as “defenders of the Christian faith” and who, in reality, have not even the vaguest basic notions about the faith they pretend to defend]
The truth is that modern national/racial/ethnic/tribal categories are just re-hated pagan categories and that those who use them today, including priests and bishops, are simply catering to the pagan, post-Christian Zeitgeist for petty political reasons. Furthermore, it is also true that since the fall of the last Orthodox Empire in 1917, the Orthodox Church has been undergoing an immense crisis brought along primarily by the infiltration of Greek Orthodox Churches by Freemasons (see here for some background information) and the infiltration of the Russian Orthodox Church by agents of the Bolshevik regime in Russia (see here and here for some background information).

oh, but I did. I didn't see the fire itself of course, but I saw plenty evidence of it. Certainly enough to consider the fire structurally Beijing TVCC was widely reported as being steel, but according to the architects that's wrong.
 I was going to suggest that it's confusion between the n-shaped tower and the hotel (finally sorted that out, the complex contains a n-shaped tower and a mostly-rectangular hotel with sloping lower parts - the hotel burned, the main n-shaped block didn't), but the  n-shaped tower is also composite with steel sections covered in reinforced concrete. [2]
Also if you look close at the wreckage you can see the concrete core.
Been browsing found this: Before 9/11 45% of buildings over 150m (about 50 stories) were built of steel. Since 9/11 it's less than 5%. [1]
Out of the 100 tallest buildings built since 9/11, only 2 are steel.
It seems people who build tall buildings seem to think that steel buildings, especially new-style steel buildings, aren't worth the risk.
WTC was an urban renewal project, built on the cheap to substandard requirements - the Port Authority could and did overrule the NYC buildings code whenever it wanted to save money. It wasn't meant to be the jewel in the NYC skyline.

Also Mailman has a threshold for how many addresses may be included in To: and Cc: before flagging for the moderator (me).  This hasn't happened recently.
I noticed this whole series of messages seems to be archived correctly, which indicates that at least some things are currently working correctly.

I'll take a Persian scholar's word for it over a fucking google search.
So I did a quickie.
Leads to Who resided in East Arabia... Right next door to Iran.
Eastern Arabia was historically known as Bahrain (Arabic: البحرين‎)
until the 18th century. This region stretched from the south of Basra
along the Persian Gulf coast and included the regions of Bahrain,
Kuwait, Al-Hasa, Qatif, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Southern Iraq, and
Northern Oman. The entire coastal strip of Eastern Arabia was known as
“Bahrain” for ten centuries.[1]
Until very recently, the whole of Eastern Arabia, from southern Iraq to
the mountains of Oman, was a place where people moved around, settled
and married unconcerned by national borders.[1]
I'll take that as proof of Cole's statement, stupid.

  Solar observatory evacuated by FBI, under lockdown/control until further
  notice, Blackhawk chopper, antenna work crew + no observable threat [PEACE]] I figured this out easily: The problem is that Ric's address, wayward4now at gmail.com, is not subscribed to the list.    Ric, subscribe here: The mystery, though, was why Ric didn't get a bounce.  It turns out the list was set to silently discard messages from non-subscribers, rather than reject (i.e., bounce) them.  So, from non-subscribers, this would look like the message was accepted, but it wasn't, and never got posted.
I have now found and changed the setting in Mailman ("generic_nonmember_action" under "Privacy options ... Sender filters").  Such messages will now instead be rejected.  So, people who post from an address that is not subscribed will get a message that the list is for subscribers only.  Certainly this is the expected behavior, rather than messages being accepted and then silently dropped.
It's not immediately clear to me whether I twiddled this setting myself, when we moved the lists, or this was already the setting from the old site when Riad managed the list.  Mea culpa, if I'm the guilty party.  I hope this config change addresses the anomalies that people have spotted recently, with some messages that appeared to be accepted for posting, but never got posted or archived.
Thanks for sending the full headers and other details shortly after the mishap.  That made it very easy to verify that Postfix/postgrey/etc. received the message properly and provided it to Mailman, but then Mailman didn't post it.  Best regards to all,

Thanks for this. I was a machinist but not a foundry worker and never knew the specifics. I WOULD add that that wind speed mentioned is SERIOUSLY underestimated. The WTC was at the absolutely windiest spot on Manhattan and even on a calm windless day at ground level the wind at the top of the building is probably higher than 20mph.

Flame temperature was probably about 600-700 C.
Comparatively low temperature, but still plenty hot. It would have set everything which would burn in probably the entire floorspace on fire - I doubt any partition walls would have survived the impact and initial fuel/air fireball blast.
2nd stage: After the jet fuel burned away, the contents of the offices and the aircraft began burning. The smoke cleared a bit, there was proportionally more air in the fuel/air mix, and carbon started burning to CO2 rather than CO. Flame temperature around 900-1,000C.
3rd stage: Many of the windows were gone, and there was a wind of about 10-20mph. This made a through draft from the windward side of the buildings to the downwind sides. As the air passed through, it heated, and got lighter - the lighter air rushed out the downwind side, increasing the draft a little.
In terms of the rate the fire was producing it (a bit over a gigawatt), the space was pretty well-insulated against loss of heat: partly by its shape, partly by the concrete floor and roof. The heat would build up A prolonged fire with good insulation and draft can increase the flame temperature in the center to maybe 1,250C. [1]
We know the fires hadn't run out of fuel when the buildings collapsed because we could see the flames inside the windward side - the place with the best air supply, and therefore the place which would run out of fuel first.

@_subject: After Mysterious Closure, Solar Observatory In New Mexico Reopens 
After Mysterious Closure, Solar Observatory In New Mexico Reopens : NPR
Laurel Wamsley
A solar observatory in New Mexico reopened Monday after being closed by authorities for 10 days — which spawned national interest and speculation into the cause of its evacuation.
Let's get this out of the way: Scientists say that aliens were not involved.
On Sept. 6, the Sunspot Solar Observatory was suddenly closed by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, the consortium that operates it, without public explanation.
People who work at the observatory, and those who live on the site, were asked to evacuate. The site's post office was also closed.
The Otero County sheriff told the local newspaper that his office was alerted but not given any information.
"The FBI is refusing to tell us what's going on," Sheriff Benny House told the Alamogordo Daily News shortly after the closure. "We've got people up there (at Sunspot) that requested us to standby while they evacuate it. Nobody would really elaborate on any of the circumstances as to why. The FBI were up there. What their purpose was nobody will say."
"But for the FBI to get involved that quick and be so secretive about it, there was a lot of stuff going on up there," he added. "There was a Blackhawk helicopter, a bunch of people around antennas and work crews on towers but nobody would tell us anything."
From there, it was off to the races. Combine the FBI, a powerful telescope and a location in rural Sunspot, N.M., and you've got all the ingredients for some rampant speculation — government surveillance, aliens, etc.
"Why the FBI close the observatory?? People have the right to know!!" one person demanded on the observatory's Google page.
The observatory, in Lincoln National Forest, about 170 miles south of Albuquerque, is home to the Dunn Solar Telescope. When it opened in 1969, it was the world's premier high spatial resolution optical solar telescope, the National Solar Observatory says. Though it's now considered a "legacy telescope," the Dunn "continues to be one of the most versatile, user-friendly setups in the world," the observatory says.
New Mexico is already associated in some people's minds with unexplained phenomena. The observatory is about 85 miles southwest of Roswell, N.M., a town long at the center of UFO lore.
So what did happen at Sunspot?
A security threat, though the specific nature of that threat remains unclear. According to a statement from AURA, the consortium and the National Science Foundation decided to vacate the site temporarily because of a security issue:
    "AURA has been cooperating with an on-going law enforcement investigation of criminal activity that occurred at Sacramento Peak. During this time, we became concerned that a suspect in the investigation potentially posed a threat to the safety of local staff and residents. For this reason, AURA temporarily vacated the facility and ceased science activities at this location.
    "The decision to vacate was based on the logistical challenges associated with protecting personnel at such a remote location, and the need for expeditious response to the potential threat. AURA determined that moving the small number of on-site staff and residents off the mountain was the most prudent and effective action to ensure their safety."
The consortium said that it recognizes that the lack of communication while the facility was being evacuated was "concerning and frustrating for some."
"However, our desire to provide additional information had to be balanced against the risk that, if spread at the time, the news would alert the suspect and impede the law enforcement investigation. That was a risk we could not take," the statement says.
And the helicopter? House, the sheriff, told The Washington Post that Black Hawk helicopters aren't uncommon in the area.
A call to an FBI spokesperson was not immediately returned. A person at the bureau's Albuquerque office said he had no information and could not comment.
The consortium said the site will have extra security for now, because of people showing up at the facility since its closure: "Given the significant amount of publicity the temporary closure has generated, and the consequent expectation of an unusual number of visitors to the site, we are temporarily engaging a security service while the facility returns to a normal working environment."
James McAteer, the New Mexico State University professor who leads operations of the telescope at the site, said he was impressed by the theories that people had come up with for the closure.
"It was the first time I've had to deny contact with Aliens and Death-by-solar-storm and underground tunnels and New communications via X-rays all at one time," he wrote in an email to NPR.
The observatory's reopening means that researchers can get to back to doing what they do: staring at the sun.
"We cannot wait to get back to work to show everyone the world class research we do every day at the telescope," McAteer said.
NPR's Emily Sullivan contributed to this report.

@_subject: busted memes - Jews NOT expelled 109 times [PEACE] 
Or the expulsions could often mean, that unlike other groups, they kept their identities and refused to assimilate. Where are those that kicked them out? How many other groups have even existed for more than 2500 years?
Maybe being kicked out so often has resulted in their group survival.
Dimitry Orlov, expat Russian blogger pointed out a few years ago that people who are outcasts from the dominant community or society tend to build stronger more resilient ones.

Dang donchahateit when a meme gets busted - in this case the ole hope
for "one-ten and never again" (as in 109 countries to date), is
factually bloody false M8, as we'd say 'ere in Oz - the truth is that
we know of 359 expulsions since at least 733 B.C.
Oh well, meme easy come, meme easy go I guess. So sad.
Quite a stunning fact, really - you have to wonder that if u bin
kicked outta 359 countries, ain't that like "doing the same thing
over and over, and expecting a different outcome?"
P'rhaps, I dunno, may be a mirror could be in order?
Who knows…

@_subject: Unz Review: The Vineyard Saker re: Nazi on Christian action in Ukraine 
The abomination of desolation standing in the holy place
The Saker
28 Sept 2018
Warning: the following text was written specifically to help Christians make sense of the “hijacked vocabulary” used in the discussion of the current attempts by the Empire to take control of the Orthodox people of the Ukraine. For atheists/agnostics this discussion will offer just some irrelevant and boring mumbo-jumbo with no relevance to the lofty realms of enlightened modern positivism.
The latest move by the Anglo-Zionist Empire in the Ukraine is truly an exceptionally ugly and dangerous one: it appears that the Patriarch of Constantinople will soon grant its full independence to the so-called “Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate”. This move is openly directed against the current biggest ecclesiastical body in the Ukraine the “Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate” and it will almost certainly lead to bloodshed and massacres similar to what took place in Odessa on May 2nd 2014: the Ukronazis will use force (riot police or even Nazi death squads) to forcibly seize the churches, cathedrals, monasteries and other buildings and properties currently owned by the Moscow Patriarchate.
There are many articles written about this development, but almost all of them are written from a secular point of view, even when written by supposedly Christian or Orthodox authors. The paradoxical element here is that a lot of theological terms are used by authors who have only a very vague idea of what these terms really mean. I have no desire to enter into this conversation and use the pseudo-spiritual reference framework typically used by such commentators and what I propose to do today is much more modest: I want to explain the original, Christian, meaning of the terms which are (mis-)used on a daily basis.
The reader will then decide how to apply them, or not, to the current crisis.
I will begin by the very basics.
The basics
The term “Christian” can mean one of two things: first, it can designate any person or group calling itself Christian. When used in this sense, the word “Christian” includes not only the all main Christian denominations, but also Sun Myung Moon’s Unification Church, the Mormons or even the 17% of British Christians who do not believe in the resurrection of Christ. Basically, in this context the term has no objective meaning whatsoever and this is how the term is mostly used nowadays.
There is also another use of the word “Christian”. This second definition is based on two very ancient statements. The first by Saint Athanasius of Alexandria (4th century) and the second one by Saint Vincent of Lérins (5th century). The first one says that the Christian faith is the faith “which the Lord gave, was preached by the Apostles, and was preserved by the Fathers. On this was the Church founded; and if anyone departs from this, he neither is nor any longer ought to be called a Christian“. The second one says that this faith only includes that “which has been believed everywhere, always and by all”. By these definitions, “Christianity” is an objective category not a “free for all”. The key words affirming this are “if anyone departs from this, he neither is nor any longer ought to be called a Christian”. These ancient definition preclude not only any form of dogmatic innovation, they also imply that words can be used either in a truly Christian sense or not. There is no middle-ground here. This belief, which was shared by all the Church Fathers and all the members of the ancient, original, Christian Church has tremendous implications, especially for what is called “ecclesiology”.
The term “ecclesiology” refers to the Christian theology concerning the Church. In other words, the teachings of Christianity about what is, or what is not, the Church (and what is, or is not, within the confines of the Church) is an objective corpus of beliefs, of key tenets, of dogmas.
What I will do next is to explain the meaning of a number of concepts when used in this second, original, context and contrast their original meaning with the basically secular and pseudo-Christian meaning which is so often attributed to them nowadays.
One more thing, for the sake of clarity: I will be writing the word church with a lower case “c” when dealing with a building (as in “the church of Saint Paul in the city’s downtown”) and with a capital “C” when dealing with an ecclesiastical jurisdiction/body (as in the “Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate”); in this latter case the use of the word “Church” with a capital “C” will in no way imply any recognition of legitimacy.
1. Canonical, canonicity and “recognized”
Most authors nowadays speak of a “canonical” Church as being a “recognized” Church. This is a circular definition, by the way: a Church is canonical because it is recognized and it is recognized because it is canonical. This begs the obvious question: recognized by whom?! The answer is also obvious: either recognized by the country’s civil/secular authorities or recognized by other “canonical” Churches.
From a truly Christian point of view, this is utterly absurd. Since when do civil/secular powers have the expertise or, for that matter, the authority to recognize or not recognize Church “A” as “canonical” and Church “B” as “non-canonical”?! And what does “canonical” mean anyway?
“Canonical” simply means “in conformity to the Church canons”. As for the word “canon” it is simply the Greek word for “ruler, measure”. Simply put, something is “canonical” when it is in conformity with the dogmas, rules, decrees, definitions and practices proclaimed and adopted by the Christian Church, primarily by means of decisions by the various recognized Church councils (I won’t go into the issue of what constitutes a recognized council since that will take too much time). You could say that something is canonical if it conforms to the the rules of Saint Athanasius of Alexandria and Saint Vincent of Lérins quoted above. This, again, is an objective category which cannot be twisted and turned into a free for all. So let’s look at one such canons and see what it says. The 31st Apostolic Canon decrees that:
    If any bishop makes use of the rulers of this world, and by their means obtains to be a bishop of a church, let him be deprived and suspended, and all that communicate with him.
This ruling of the apostles themselves has later been recognized and confirmed during an Ecumenical Council. The 3rd Canon of the 7th Ecumenical Council says:
    “Every appointment of a bishop, or of a presbyter, or of a deacon made by (civil) rulers shall remain void in accordance with the Canon which says: “If any bishop comes into possession of a church by employing secular rulers, let him be deposed from office, and let him be excommunicated. And all those who communicate with him too.”
You see the problem now? How can anybody consider that civil/secular authorities are competent to “recognize” this or that Church as “canonical” when the canons of the Apostles and of a Ecumenical Council (the most authoritative Church Council) specifically state that if a bishop has obtains his “legitimacy” (office, rank, diocese or church properties) from civil/secular authorities he should be deposed, thus making him totally illegitimate? From a canonical point of view, the recognition of civil authorities is not only meaningless, it could, depending on the exact circumstances, constitute grounds for deposition!
The reality is that during much of the 20th century what we have seen is the civil/secular authorities of various countries supporting one Church against another for purely political purposes. This was especially prevalent in the Communist countries. Some bishops were considered “friendly” and others “enemies of the people”. The secular authorities then simply used brute force (usually in the form of riot police) to evict the latter and replace them with the former. The “friendly” bishops then took control of all of the churches, monasteries and other properties and declared themselves to be legitimate and canonical because they were recognized and because they were placed in control of a lot of very visible and historical real estate.
Needless to say, that kind of dependence on the goodwill and support of civil/secular authorities placed the “friendly” Churches into a complete subordination to the state, exactly what the civil/secular authorities wanted in the first place. The fact that, unlike in most similar cases before the 20th century, the civil authorities in the 20th century were not only secular, but openly and militantly atheistic created a qualitatively new phenomenon: the subordination of bishops and Churches to the will of anti-religious secular regimes. Nowadays, of course, most governments in nominally Orthodox countries do not declare themselves as militant atheists, but the subordinate relationship of the official “state Churches” to the secular authorities has remained unchanged (even if their official rhetoric has been adapted to the new realities).
The bottom line is this: all this talk about “canonical” and “recognized” Churches is a self-serving canard used by those Churches who have obtained their official status by completely uncanonical means. In the overwhelming number of cases, when individuals or organizations use the term “canonical” they never mean “in conformity to the Church canons” simply because they are both ignorant and indifferent to what the Christian teachings really says about these matters.
2. Bishops, Patriarchs and wannabe “Eastern Popes”
Who is the biggest Ortho-boss, the bishop, or maybe the Archbishop, or the Metropolitan, or the Patriarch? It must be the “Ecumenical” Patriarch, right? Since he is “Ecumenical” he must be like an “Orthodox Pope”. Check out his official title: “His Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome, and Ecumenical Patriarch“. God is, by definition, (only) “divine”. The Third Person of the Trinity is (just) the “Holy” Spirit. But the Patriarch of Constantinople is his “most divine and all-holy”! Wow – he surely must really be some kind of super Ortho-Pope!
There are only four main “ranks” in the Church: faithful, deacon, presbyter and bishop. All the rest are just honorific and/or administrative titles including reader, subdeacon, chanter, acolyte, protodeacon, archdeacon, protopresbyter, archpriest, archimandrite, mitred archpriest, protosyngellos, archbishop, metropolitan and patriarch. The rank of emperor, by the way, was associated with the rank of subdeacon and the emperor would receive the Mysteries (aka “sacraments”, the Eucharist) to the side of the altar with the subdeacons. None of these titles indicate any qualitative difference or mystical superiority.
The Church, while essentially mystical (thus referred to as the “theandric Body of Christ”) also has an administrative/organizational aspect which must exist within the social and political environment of the society in which it operates. For example, while in mystical terms all bishops are equal, it was obvious from the beginning that being the bishop of the imperial city (be it Rome or Constantinople) was a far more important office than being the bishop of some remote and scarcely populated diocese. Furthermore, while all important decisions were made in councils (local or ecumenical) day to day decisions could be made by bishops specially invested with that authority (sometimes assisted by a few more bishops). But except for honorific and administrative reasons, all bishops are fundamentally equals, invested with the same charisma (gift) and authority. The Latin expression primus inter pares, or “first among equals”, expresses this reality.
This also fully applies to the “Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome, and Ecumenical Patriarch” who had a honorific primacy simply because he was the ruling bishop of the capital of the Empire, just as the ruling bishop of Rome (the “Pope” in Latin terminology) had before him. I won’t go into the history of how the (tiny) Patriarchate of Constantinople used its former position to claim some kind of universal jurisdiction, this would take too much time, but I will simply note that two events which occurred on the 15th century have irrevocably made void any and all claims of primacy (even of honor) by the Patriarch of Constantinople: the False Union of Florence in 1439 AD and the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 AD.
    [Sidebar: the Russian Orthodox Church, by the way, could lay claim of being the “Third Rome” as successor to the First and Second Rome since the First Rome fell to the Barbarians in 476 and fell into apostasy in 1054 while the Second Rome fell into apostasy in 1439 and to the Ottomans in 1453. I won’t go into the merits of this argument, but I will just point out that it absolutely infuriates the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The fact that the Russian Orthodox Church is by far the biggest of all and the fact that Moscow and Saint Petersburg were the capitals of the last Orthodox empire only further serves to create tensions, and even outright hostility, between the Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Moscow Patriarchate. This is all very relevant in the case of the current political struggle over the Ukraine and the role of the Patriarch of Constantinople in it].
For all these historical and political arguments, the reality is that the Christian Church has always been conciliar in nature: that is to say that councils (local or major ones) were both the mode and the sole authority by which important decisions could be taken, never any single individual. The example of the Apostolic Council of Jerusalem (in about 50 AD) was the first one to set such an example and it has always been followed by those faithful to the original Christian ecclesiology ever since.
3. The “right” for each country or nation to have its own Church
This is one of the most outlandish and yet also most frequent assertions made by almost every commentator out there: that there is some kind of “right” for each nation or country to have its own, independent, Church. Nothing could be further from the truth!
The reality is that Christianity (like Islam, by the way) absolutely rejects any categories based on ethnicity, race, tribe or anything similar. Here are just a few quotes from the New Testament proving this:
    There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus (Gal 3:28)
    For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one Spirit (Gal 5:6)
    Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God (1 Cor 7:19)
    For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit (1 Cor; 12 :13)
But the clearest and most definitive statement on this issue is this one:
    Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all (Col 3:9-11).
So national/racial/ethnic/tribal categories are lies (contrast that with the racist interpretation of the Scripture by rabbinical phariseism aka modern “Orthodox Judaism”!), becoming a Christian renews your knowledge (that is make you adopt new categories) and in Christ all are one (no more national/racial/ethnic/tribal for true Christians).
This teaching have always remained at the core of the true Christian dogmatic anthropology (i.e. teachings about the nature of man). In fact, what is nowadays called “phyletism” or “ethno-phyletism” (nationalism or tribalism) has been condemned as a heresy by a pan-Orthodox council as late as in 1872 (this council was held in Constantinople, of all places, what sad irony!) For those interested in the historical context for this council, you can download a PDF about it here:     [Sidebar: It is ironical – and sad – that so many of those who today engage in “hunting the Jew” by means of putting silly parentheses around (((names))) and who call themselves Orthodox Christians completely fail to realize two thing: first, they are using categories which the Church has denounced as heresies and, second, they are using the exact same categories as many of the (Orthodox) Jews they are denouncing. Frankly, this is rather pathetic and only goes to show the fantastically low level of spiritual education of those who fancy themselves as “defenders of the Christian faith” and who, in reality, have not even the vaguest basic notions about the faith they pretend to defend]
The truth is that modern national/racial/ethnic/tribal categories are just re-hated pagan categories and that those who use them today, including priests and bishops, are simply catering to the pagan, post-Christian Zeitgeist for petty political reasons. Furthermore, it is also true that since the fall of the last Orthodox Empire in 1917, the Orthodox Church has been undergoing an immense crisis brought along primarily by the infiltration of Greek Orthodox Churches by Freemasons (see here for some background information) and the infiltration of the Russian Orthodox Church by agents of the Bolshevik regime in Russia (see here and here for some background information). The combined effects of these three phenomena (1917 Revolution, Masonic and Bolshevik infiltration) has resulted in a deep crisis from which most Orthodox Churches have yet to recover and which often makes them easy pawns in political battles (I discussed this issue in some detail in my article “Why Orthodox Churches Are Still Used as Pawns in Political Games”).
As for rank and file Orthodox Christians, they are sometimes induced to come to the wrong conclusions about this because they believe (correctly) that, unlike the Latin Papacy, the Orthodox Church does not have one single super-boss and one single administration. They also believe (correctly) that, unlike the Latin Papacy of the past, the Orthodox Church did not have a single “official” language of worship and that, in fact, Orthodox ritual practice is rather diverse and often includes local cultural influences. These correct beliefs, however, bring them to the entirely false conclusion that each Orthodox nation has some kind of “right” to have its own independent (“autocephalous”) Orthodox Church.
The fact that much of the clergy of the “official” and “recognized” (that is “state approved” vide supra) Orthodox Churches is more than happy to comfort them in these beliefs does not help.
As for the secular leaders of the state, they are more than happy to have an Orthodox Church which is both 1) totally compliant and 2) nationalistic.
What is lost in all this madness is the Orthodox truth, the wordview of the true, original, Christianity, and the “spirit of the Fathers” (or phronema in Greek) which best expresses it. It is also no wonder that the most corrupt Orthodox hierarchs, like the Patriarch of Constantinople, are more than happy to pretend that Orthodox ecclesiology does somehow grant them the authority of some kind of “Eastern Pope”.
This is truly the “abomination of desolation standing in the holy place” (Matt 24:15 & Daniel 9:27)!
Those Orthodox Christians who nowadays succumb to the heresy of ethno-phyletism would do well to remember that besides the, shall we say, “geographical” meaning of the words of Christ (in reference to Jerusalem, of course, but also Rome, Constantinople, Moscow, Kiev and many other cities), there is also a second, spiritual meaning well explained by Saint Maximos the Confessor:
    “From the passions embedded in the soul the demons take their starting base to stir up passionate thought in us. Then, by making war on the mind through them they force it to go along and consent to sin. When it is overcome they lead it on to a sin of thought, and when this is accomplished they finally bring it as a prisoner to the deed. After this, at length, the demons who have devastated the soul through thoughts withdraw with them. In the mind there remains only the idol of sin and which the Lord says, “When you see the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place, let him who reads understand.” Man’s mind is a holy place and a temple of God in which the demons have laid waste the soul through passionate thoughts and set up the idol of sin. That these things have already happened in history no one who has read Josephus can, I think, doubt, though some say that these things will also happen when the Antichrist comes.”(2nd Century on Love, Here we have arguably one of the greatest Christian theologians and philosophers of all times reminding us that the “abomination of desolation” will also happen in the minds of those who, suaded by demons and passions, stray away from that “which has been believed everywhere, always and by all” and, instead, let their minds and souls be polluted by the post-Christian nonsense of modern nationalisms. Nationalism, of course, is not only an modern idol, but it is also a rather crude form of self-worship, yet another truly satanic practice!
Conclusion: what this is all about and we can can do about it
The first sad reality is that none of this is about Christianity, Orthodoxy, ecclesiology or anything else remotely connected to any notion of truth at all.
This is about buildings, real-estate, political power, money, influence, indoctrination and all the other key “values” of our times.
The second sad reality is that innocent and well-intentioned people will suffer and even die as a direct consequence of the immoral actions of a few power-greedy individuals.
The truth is that a religion-fulled civil war appears to have already been set in motion and that there is nothing we, simple rank and file Christians, can do about it, at least not in secular terms. In spiritual terms, we can do two things: we can, of course, pray and we can refuse to become part of a debate in which every single concept dear to us is misused, distorted and perverted. For that, we need to understand that the abomination which is taking place before our eyes did not just pop-up into existence ex nihilo and that there are profound spiritual roots to the almost universal adoption of non-Christian categories by most, albeit not all, Christians. Christ Himself reminded us that “If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you” (John 15:9). We also know that the wisdom of this world is “foolishness with God” (1 Cor 3:19) and that it comes “not come from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic” (James 3:15). Then how can we then still operate by using worldly categories or worldly interpretations of patristic concepts?
What we can, and must, do is follow Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s famous appeal and “live not by lies” even if most of our contemporaries, including many Christians (even clerics!) have given up on the very notion of “truth”. In Solzhenitsyn’s words “So in our timidity, let each of us make a choice: whether consciously, to remain a servant of falsehood — of course, it is not out of inclination, but to feed one’s family, that one raises his children in the spirit of lies — or to shrug off the lies and become an honest person worthy of respect both by one’s children and contemporaries”.
After all, if we are truly Christians, then we can remember Christ’s promise that “blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled” (Matt 5:6) and, hopefully, this will give us courage to “stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle” (2 Thess 2:15).

Needless to say, that kind of dependence on the goodwill and support of civil/secular authorities placed the “friendly” Churches into a complete subordination to the state, exactly what the civil/secular authorities wanted in the first place. The fact that, unlike in most similar cases before the 20th century, the civil authorities in the 20th century were not only secular, but openly and militantly atheistic created a qualitatively new phenomenon: the subordination of bishops and Churches to the will of anti-religious secular regimes. Nowadays, of course, most governments in nominally Orthodox countries do not declare themselves as militant atheists, but the subordinate relationship of the official “state Churches” to the secular authorities has remained unchanged (even if their official rhetoric has been adapted to the new realities).
The bottom line is this: all this talk about “canonical” and “recognized” Churches is a self-serving canard used by those Churches who have obtained their official status by completely uncanonical means. In the overwhelming number of cases, when individuals or organizations use the term “canonical” they never mean “in conformity to the Church canons” simply because they are both ignorant and indifferent to what the Christian teachings really says about these matters.
2. Bishops, Patriarchs and wannabe “Eastern Popes”
Who is the biggest Ortho-boss, the bishop, or maybe the Archbishop, or the Metropolitan, or the Patriarch? It must be the “Ecumenical” Patriarch, right? Since he is “Ecumenical” he must be like an “Orthodox Pope”. Check out his official title: “His Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome, and Ecumenical Patriarch“. God is, by definition, (only) “divine”. The Third Person of the Trinity is (just) the “Holy” Spirit. But the Patriarch of Constantinople is his “most divine and all-holy”! Wow – he surely must really be some kind of super Ortho-Pope!
There are only four main “ranks” in the Church: faithful, deacon, presbyter and bishop. All the rest are just honorific and/or administrative titles including reader, subdeacon, chanter, acolyte, protodeacon, archdeacon, protopresbyter, archpriest, archimandrite, mitred archpriest, protosyngellos, archbishop, metropolitan and patriarch. The rank of emperor, by the way, was associated with the rank of subdeacon and the emperor would receive the Mysteries (aka “sacraments”, the Eucharist) to the side of the altar with the subdeacons. None of these titles indicate any qualitative difference or mystical superiority.
The Church, while essentially mystical (thus referred to as the “theandric Body of Christ”) also has an administrative/organizational aspect which must exist within the social and political environment of the society in which it operates. For example, while in mystical terms all bishops are equal, it was obvious from the beginning that being the bishop of the imperial city (be it Rome or Constantinople) was a far more important office than being the bishop of some remote and scarcely populated diocese. Furthermore, while all important decisions were made in councils (local or ecumenical) day to day decisions could be made by bishops specially invested with that authority (sometimes assisted by a few more bishops). But except for honorific and administrative reasons, all bishops are fundamentally equals, invested with the same charisma (gift) and authority. The Latin expression primus inter pares, or “first among equals”, expresses this reality.
This also fully applies to the “Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople, New Rome, and Ecumenical Patriarch” who had a honorific primacy simply because he was the ruling bishop of the capital of the Empire, just as the ruling bishop of Rome (the “Pope” in Latin terminology) had before him. I won’t go into the history of how the (tiny) Patriarchate of Constantinople used its former position to claim some kind of universal jurisdiction, this would take too much time, but I will simply note that two events which occurred on the 15th century have irrevocably made void any and all claims of primacy (even of honor) by the Patriarch of Constantinople: the False Union of Florence in 1439 AD and the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453 AD.
    [Sidebar: the Russian Orthodox Church, by the way, could lay claim of being the “Third Rome” as successor to the First and Second Rome since the First Rome fell to the Barbarians in 476 and fell into apostasy in 1054 while the Second Rome fell into apostasy in 1439 and to the Ottomans in 1453. I won’t go into the merits of this argument, but I will just point out that it absolutely infuriates the Patriarchate of Constantinople. The fact that the Russian Orthodox Church is by far the biggest of all and the fact that Moscow and Saint Petersburg were the capitals of the last Orthodox empire only further serves to create tensions, and even outright hostility, between the Patriarchate of Constantinople and the Moscow Patriarchate. This is all very relevant in the case of the current political struggle over the Ukraine and the role of the Patriarch of Constantinople in it].
For all these historical and political arguments, the reality is that the Christian Church has always been conciliar in nature: that is to say that councils (local or major ones) were both the mode and the sole authority by which important decisions could be taken, never any single individual. The example of the Apostolic Council of Jerusalem (in about 50 AD) was the first one to set such an example and it has always been followed by those faithful to the original Christian ecclesiology ever since.
3. The “right” for each country or nation to have its own Church
This is one of the most outlandish and yet also most frequent assertions made by almost every commentator out there: that there is some kind of “right” for each nation or country to have its own, independent, Church. Nothing could be further from the truth!
The reality is that Christianity (like Islam, by the way) absolutely rejects any categories based on ethnicity, race, tribe or anything similar. Here are just a few quotes from the New Testament proving this:
    There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ Jesus (Gal 3:28)
    For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free and have been all made to drink into one Spirit (Gal 5:6)
    Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God (1 Cor 7:19)
    For by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit (1 Cor; 12 :13)
But the clearest and most definitive statement on this issue is this one:
    Lie not one to another, seeing that ye have put off the old man with his deeds; And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all (Col 3:9-11).
So national/racial/ethnic/tribal categories are lies (contrast that with the racist interpretation of the Scripture by rabbinical phariseism aka modern “Orthodox Judaism”!), becoming a Christian renews your knowledge (that is make you adopt new categories) and in Christ all are one (no more national/racial/ethnic/tribal for true Christians).
This teaching have always remained at the core of the true Christian dogmatic anthropology (i.e. teachings about the nature of man). In fact, what is nowadays called “phyletism” or “ethno-phyletism” (nationalism or tribalism) has been condemned as a heresy by a pan-Orthodox council as late as in 1872 (this council was held in Constantinople, of all places, what sad irony!) For those interested in the historical context for this council, you can download a PDF about it here:     [Sidebar: It is ironical – and sad – that so many of those who today engage in “hunting the Jew” by means of putting silly parentheses around (((names))) and who call themselves Orthodox Christians completely fail to realize two thing: first, they are using categories which the Church has denounced as heresies and, second, they are using the exact same categories as many of the (Orthodox) Jews they are denouncing. Frankly, this is rather pathetic and only goes to show the fantastically low level of spiritual education of those who fancy themselves as “defenders of the Christian faith” and who, in reality, have not even the vaguest basic notions about the faith they pretend to defend]
The truth is that modern national/racial/ethnic/tribal categories are just re-hated pagan categories and that those who use them today, including priests and bishops, are simply catering to the pagan, post-Christian Zeitgeist for petty political reasons. Furthermore, it is also true that since the fall of the last Orthodox Empire in 1917, the Orthodox Church has been undergoing an immense crisis brought along primarily by the infiltration of Greek Orthodox Churches by Freemasons (see here for some background information) and the infiltration of the Russian Orthodox Church by agents of the Bolshevik regime in Russia (see here and here for some background information). The combined effects of these three phenomena (1917 Revolution, Masonic and Bolshevik infiltration) has resulted in a deep crisis from which most Orthodox Churches have yet to recover and which often makes them easy pawns in political battles (I discussed this issue in some detail in my article “Why Orthodox Churches Are Still Used as Pawns in Political Games”).
As for rank and file Orthodox Christians, they are sometimes induced to come to the wrong conclusions about this because they believe (correctly) that, unlike the Latin Papacy, the Orthodox Church does not have one single super-boss and one single administration. They also believe (correctly) that, unlike the Latin Papacy of the past, the Orthodox Church did not have a single “official” language of worship and that, in fact, Orthodox ritual practice is rather diverse and often includes local cultural influences. These correct beliefs, however, bring them to the entirely false conclusion that each Orthodox nation has some kind of “right” to have its own independent (“autocephalous”) Orthodox Church.
The fact that much of the clergy of the “official” and “recognized” (that is “state approved” vide supra) Orthodox Churches is more than happy to comfort them in these beliefs does not help.
As for the secular leaders of the state, they are more than happy to have an Orthodox Church which is both 1) totally compliant and 2) nationalistic.
What is lost in all this madness is the Orthodox truth, the wordview of the true, original, Christianity, and the “spirit of the Fathers” (or phronema in Greek) which best expresses it. It is also no wonder that the most corrupt Orthodox hierarchs, like the Patriarch of Constantinople, are more than happy to pretend that Orthodox ecclesiology does somehow grant them the authority of some kind of “Eastern Pope”.
This is truly the “abomination of desolation standing in the holy place” (Matt 24:15 & Daniel 9:27)!
Those Orthodox Christians who nowadays succumb to the heresy of ethno-phyletism would do well to remember that besides the, shall we say, “geographical” meaning of the words of Christ (in reference to Jerusalem, of course, but also Rome, Constantinople, Moscow, Kiev and many other cities), there is also a second, spiritual meaning well explained by Saint Maximos the Confessor:
    “From the passions embedded in the soul the demons take their starting base to stir up passionate thought in us. Then, by making war on the mind through them they force it to go along and consent to sin. When it is overcome they lead it on to a sin of thought, and when this is accomplished they finally bring it as a prisoner to the deed. After this, at length, the demons who have devastated the soul through thoughts withdraw with them. In the mind there remains only the idol of sin and which the Lord says, “When you see the abomination of desolation standing in the holy place, let him who reads understand.” Man’s mind is a holy place and a temple of God in which the demons have laid waste the soul through passionate thoughts and set up the idol of sin. That these things have already happened in history no one who has read Josephus can, I think, doubt, though some say that these things will also happen when the Antichrist comes.”(2nd Century on Love, Here we have arguably one of the greatest Christian theologians and philosophers of all times reminding us that the “abomination of desolation” will also happen in the minds of those who, suaded by demons and passions, stray away from that “which has been believed everywhere, always and by all” and, instead, let their minds and souls be polluted by the post-Christian nonsense of modern nationalisms. Nationalism, of course, is not only an modern idol, but it is also a rather crude form of self-worship, yet another truly satanic practice!
Conclusion: what this is all about and we can can do about it
The first sad reality is that none of this is about Christianity, Orthodoxy, ecclesiology or anything else remotely connected to any notion of truth at all.
This is about buildings, real-estate, political power, money, influence, indoctrination and all the other key “values” of our times.
The second sad reality is that innocent and well-intentioned people will suffer and even die as a direct consequence of the immoral actions of a few power-greedy individuals.
The truth is that a religion-fulled civil war appears to have already been set in motion and that there is nothing we, simple rank and file Christians, can do about it, at least not in secular terms. In spiritual terms, we can do two things: we can, of course, pray and we can refuse to become part of a debate in which every single concept dear to us is misused, distorted and perverted. For that, we need to understand that the abomination which is taking place before our eyes did not just pop-up into existence ex nihilo and that there are profound spiritual roots to the almost universal adoption of non-Christian categories by most, albeit not all, Christians. Christ Himself reminded us that “If ye were of the world, the world would love his own: but because ye are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you” (John 15:9). We also know that the wisdom of this world is “foolishness with God” (1 Cor 3:19) and that it comes “not come from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic” (James 3:15). Then how can we then still operate by using worldly categories or worldly interpretations of patristic concepts?
What we can, and must, do is follow Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s famous appeal and “live not by lies” even if most of our contemporaries, including many Christians (even clerics!) have given up on the very notion of “truth”. In Solzhenitsyn’s words “So in our timidity, let each of us make a choice: whether consciously, to remain a servant of falsehood — of course, it is not out of inclination, but to feed one’s family, that one raises his children in the spirit of lies — or to shrug off the lies and become an honest person worthy of respect both by one’s children and contemporaries”.
After all, if we are truly Christians, then we can remember Christ’s promise that “blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled” (Matt 5:6) and, hopefully, this will give us courage to “stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle” (2 Thess 2:15).

oh, but I did. I didn't see the fire itself of course, but I saw plenty evidence of it. Certainly enough to consider the fire structurally Beijing TVCC was widely reported as being steel, but according to the architects that's wrong.
 I was going to suggest that it's confusion between the n-shaped tower and the hotel (finally sorted that out, the complex contains a n-shaped tower and a mostly-rectangular hotel with sloping lower parts - the hotel burned, the main n-shaped block didn't), but the  n-shaped tower is also composite with steel sections covered in reinforced concrete. [2]
Also if you look close at the wreckage you can see the concrete core.
Been browsing found this: Before 9/11 45% of buildings over 150m (about 50 stories) were built of steel. Since 9/11 it's less than 5%. [1]
Out of the 100 tallest buildings built since 9/11, only 2 are steel.
It seems people who build tall buildings seem to think that steel buildings, especially new-style steel buildings, aren't worth the risk.
WTC was an urban renewal project, built on the cheap to substandard requirements - the Port Authority could and did overrule the NYC buildings code whenever it wanted to save money. It wasn't meant to be the jewel in the NYC skyline.
Structurally, it was a piece of crap. Tinsel with rocks.

Johnny Cash's family tells white supremacists to get Johnny's name out of their mouth
Rosanne Cash is the eldest daughter of American legend Johnny Cash. After receiving some information that her late father’s memorabilia was showing up in images circulating around the Charlottesville KKK riot, she wanted to make things very clear—Johnny Cash had zero time for white supremacist bullshit. Taking to her Facebook account, Rosanne Cash posted this:
A message from the children of Johnny Cash:
We were alerted to a video of a young man in Charlottesville, a self-proclaimed neo-Nazi, spewing hatred and bile. He was wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the name of Johnny Cash, our father. We were sickened by the association.
Johnny Cash was a man whose heart beat with the rhythm of love and social justice. He received humanitarian awards from, among others, the Jewish National Fund, B’nai Brith, and the United Nations. He championed the rights of Native Americans, protested the war in Vietnam, was a voice for the poor, the struggling and the disenfranchised, and an advocate for the rights of prisoners. Along with our sister Rosanne, he was on the advisory board of an organization solely devoted to preventing gun violence among children. His pacifism and inclusive patriotism were two of his most defining characteristics. He would be horrified at even a casual use of his name or image for an idea or a cause founded in persecution and hatred. The white supremacists and neo-Nazis who marched in Charlottesville are poison in our society, and an insult to every American hero who wore a uniform to fight the Nazis in WWII. Several men in the extended Cash family were among those who served with honor.
Our dad told each of us, over and over throughout our lives, ‘Children, you can choose love or hate. I choose love.’
We do not judge race, color, sexual orientation or creed. We value the capacity for love and the impulse towards kindness. We respect diversity, and cherish our shared humanity. We recognize the suffering of other human beings, and remain committed to our natural instinct for compassion and service.
To any who claim supremacy over other human beings, to any who believe in racial or religious hierarchy: we are not you. Our father, as a person, icon, or symbol, is not you. We ask that the Cash name be kept far away from destructive and hateful ideology.
We Choose Love.

I'm older still and I remember the rollover from, in the US, "Secret Agent", to The Prisoner, which I thought was VERY excellent even when I was a kid.
You'll note the one recurring theme throughout the whole series. There was NO ONE  could trust. Ever. On reading Steve's details I've seen slightly different show creation narratives but one thing I know... McGoohan was DRIVEN to do this. He was willing to fund it out of his own pocket if necessary. Whatever that 'argument with the chief' was about in the last episode (all you hear is thunder) was in some way, irl, connected to his drive to get the prisoner on the air.
I believe all the prisoner episodes are on youtube. I torrented the collection a few years ago. There's also a number of interviews with McGoohan about it on Youtube and quite detailed sociological analyses of the overall show and episodes floating around the intertubz as well.

"Your heroes are losers. You are supporting a lost cause. Believe me, I knew the original Nazis." He explained that he was born in Austria in 1947, right after World War II, and growing up he "was surrounded by broken men, men who came home from the war filled with shrapnel and guilt, men who were misled into a losing ideology. And I can tell you that these ghosts that you idolize spent the rest of their lives living in shame. And right now, they're resting in hell."

@_subject: Congress Members To Wear Barcodes So Lobbyists Can Scan Prices 
WASHINGTON, D.C.—In a move to make purchasing congresspeople easier and faster for lobbyists, Congress voted to approve a new measure that calls for congresspeople to wear barcodes on their foreheads so lobbyists, activists, and corporations can simply scan them and self-checkout.
Self-checkout machines will be installed at all exits of the Capitol Building, so once they've added congresspeople to their cart, lobbyists can pay right on the way out.
"Purchasing congresspeople used to be a time-consuming, expensive process," said a Planned Parenthood representative. "Now, we can simply walk through Congress, scan all the congresspeople that are for sale, and checkout without having to interact with any humans." "We hate humans---like, a lot," the PP rep added.
One major military-industrial complex lobby group, Americans For Bigger Bombs, said they are also in support of the new move.
"When you need to make a quick pit stop at our nation's legislative body to purchase a few congresspeople to start a new war, you need to do it fast," said one AFBB lawyer. "An attack on Iran can't wait while you wheel and deal, wine and dine, and negotiate endlessly. Now, I can just scan and go."

When the state withers away there's no one to report it and besides you CERTAINLY won't read about it in the NYTimes.
For instance, Libya... Libya was a successful direct democracy anarcho-syndicalist dream nation. The most affluent nation in North Africa if not ALL Africa, funding development projects for any AU nation that asked (cutting western businesses entirely out of African Development for the most part...) The workers literally ran the factories and local governments? People's Assemblies. Couldn't have THAT! al-Qaeda and NATO 'fixed' it.
Wikipedia: "The Green Book rejects both capitalism and communism, as well as representative democracy. Instead, it proposes a type of direct democracy overseen by the General People's Committee which allows direct political participation for all adult citizens.[7][8]
The book states that "Freedom of expression is the natural right of every person, even if they choose to behave irrationally, to express his or her insanity."[9] The Green Book states that freedom of speech is based upon public ownership of book publishers, newspapers, television, and radio stations, on the grounds that private ownership would be undemocratic.[7]
 "The final step is when the new socialist society reaches the stage where profit and money disappear. It is through transforming society into a fully productive society, and through reaching in production a level where the material needs of the members of society are satisfied. On that final stage, profit will automatically disappear and there will be no need for money."[11]" The book:  Ps.

@_subject: "White nationalists don't get to reinvent what Viking culture is" 
Vikings were not Nazis, anti-racists tell Swedish white supremacists
Will Worley A Live Action Role Play (LARP) group in Sweden is campaigning to halt the neo-Nazi appropriation of Viking symbols. Runes and other ancient Viking iconography have long been associated with the Nazism, by groups who use them to propagate the myth of white ethnic purity and supremacy. Larpers in Sweden have formed Vikingar Mot Rasism (VMR, or Vikings Against Racism) in order to combat the far-right hold over Viking heritage. "Viking enthusiasts get mistaken for racists and Nazis all the time, and we're very uncomfortable with that. White nationalists don't get to reinvent what Viking culture is," Solvej von Malmborg, a VMR member, told the Local.
The group protested the neo-Nazi Nordic Resistance Movement (NMR) along with thousands of other counter-demonstrators as the group attempted to march through Gothenburg.
The VMR spent time explaining to other anti-racists activists the difference between Viking heritage and neo-Nazi symbols.
Ms von Malmborg continued: "When a symbol becomes too closely connected with a racist movement, it becomes theirs – it belongs to the racists and eventually, using it can be seen as a form of inciting racial hatred. Then the symbol is removed from common cultural use."
The NMR uses an arrow-shaped ‘Tyr-rune’ against a green background as its logo. The rune represented the Norse god of war, Tyr, and its shape is believed to be related to the North Star. It was also used by a Nazi SS division. Other Viking iconography has been used extensively by the far right since the Nazis used them to express their fetishisation of perceived strong ancient and ethnically pure cultures, like the Vikings and Romans. The Odal rune was part of the Runic alphabet and used by Vikings to denote inherited estate. But it used by the Nazis to symbolise their central concept of ‘blood and soil’.
The Waffen SS used runes extensively, including the ‘Sig Rune’ – originally representing the sun – which formed their logo.
The VMR formed after they noticed more racists attending Viking-themed events several years ago. Ms von Malmborg said their presence was contrary to the inclusive atmosphere of Larp.

I have this hypothesis that informs me there's two types of people... pastoral folks who just want to live harmoniously and simply, and psycho-sociopaths.
If the pastoral folks rose up and slaughtered the latter, they would be so much more likely to return to those peaceful ways after the slaughter than the latter, which never were, and never would be peaceful. HOPEFULLY it would drown that tendency in the shallow end of the gene pool, in the slime it oozed from.

"To say that nonviolence means passively lying down to be annihilated by the violence of those in power is to fundamentally misunderstand the purpose of nonviolence." -MLK jr.
That means we proactively slaughter Nazi scumbags in self defense.
Nonviolence protects the Fascist state and is inherently racist.
"Nonviolence is racist. I do not mean to exchange insults, and I use the epithet racist only after careful consideration. Nonviolence is an inherently privileged position in the modern context. Besides the fact that the typical pacifist is quite clearly white and middle class, pacifism as an ideology comes from a privileged context. It ignores that violence is already here; that violence is an unavoidable, structurally integral part of the current social hierarchy; and that it is people of color who are most affected by that violence. Pacifism assumes that white people who grew up in the suburbs with all their basic needs met can counsel oppressed people, many of whom are people of color, to suffer patiently under an inconceivably greater violence, until such time as the Great White Father is swayed by the movement’s demands or the pacifists achieve that legendary 'critical mass.' -Peter Gelderloos "How Nonviolence Protects the State"

This program does not produce ionizing radiation. It may seem like it goes without saying, but we will clarify it anyway. irradiate cannot directly cause harm to your body.
As for your computer, well… We do not recommend you run this as root, especially against targets like:
    Your kernel

    Important block devices, such as your system’s boot medium
    /dev/mem
Treat this program like you would rm or shred. The files it acts on should be considered lost, and any resemblance they bear to the originals considered as a happy accident.

I feel about it just the way I feel about the ones on my southern border. Recently I noted a haaretz op-ed fingerpointing at the US camps and pointed out on their comments that they're just trying to divert attention from their own.

JustSecurity is a prime source for factual info related to National Security.
Here. Have a recent article about how the US ended up with kiddie koncentration kamps and why ICE is violating international law that protects refugees and asylum seekers in quite a few ways. You might actually learn something other than how to reactionary-ly fill a post with links.
"Since the first Democratic presidential debates at the end of June, candidates, pundits and former government officials have discussed whether provisions of law that turn unauthorized border crossing into the federal crime of “improper entry” – in addition to a civil immigration law violation – should be repealed.
The chair of the Republican National Committee characterized the proposal as a call for open borders. Some Obama administration officials have also argued against such proposals. Juliette Kayyem, a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official during the Obama administration, asserted that Section 1325 was needed to protect borders and deport people. Sarah Saldaña, director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) during the Obama administration, urged the law should stay on the books as a “tool” in the “tool box.” Former DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson argued that decriminalizing unauthorized entry was tantamount to a declaration that our borders are open.
Much of the debate has unfortunately failed to make clear that, even without these criminal laws on the books, the border would still be guarded by Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) agents, drones, fencing and (some) wall, and people who cross the border without authorization would still be subject to the administrative system Congress created to address violations of U.S. immigration law. For example, they would still be taken into Border Patrol custody, put into the administrative deportation system’s proceedings, deported if they are not ruled eligible for asylum or other relief, and in the meantime held – often unnecessarily – in ICE detention facilities for weeks, months or longer. Other laws would still criminalize smuggling, trafficking and a wide range of other criminal conduct should a person who crossed the border have committed such crimes.
Also absent from much of the debate has been information on how laws that criminalize entry and reentry actually work in practice and how they have been used to punish asylum seekers and migrants in violation of due process and U.S. refugee treaty prohibitions – long before the Trump administration’s zero tolerance/family separation fiasco, and continuing to this day..."

@_subject: 'Eternally Blue' (At least for 9 years) 
I always figured this was the guy who either leaked or lost control of all those years-old NSA cyberwar tools ('Shadowbrokers')
Packrat... Terrabytes of data stored EVERYWHERE.
"...just days before Martin was arrested in 2016, a group known as the Shadow Brokers began leaking classified NSA hacking tools online. A Twitter account that was allegedly Martin’s messaged someone the words “shelf life, three weeks,” according to a prior ruling from the judge. Hours later, stolen government documents were posted online, according to prosecutors. No direct link between the Shadow Brokers and Martin’s case has been made."
"Former NSA contractor Harold T. Martin was sentenced Friday to nine years in federal prison for his role in a massive theft of classified documents.
Martin was responsible for one of the largest leaks of U.S government secrets, collecting up to 50 terabytes of classified government documents over the course of two decades.
U.S. District Judge Richard Bennett’s sentence falls short of the maximum number of years Martin previously faced — 10 years for each of the 20 counts against him — for unauthorized and willful retention of national defense information. However, the sentence aligns with the plea agreement his public defenders reached with the U.S. government.
The U.S. attorneys said his theft called for “significant” prison time, according to the government’s sentencing memorandum, which CyberScoop obtained.
“The exceptionally grave nature and circumstances of the defendant’s criminal conduct call for a significant prison term,” they write. “For nearly twenty years he chose to violate the public’s trust and the nation’s laws by stealing and retaining national defense information. The defendant knew the entire time he was committing these crimes.”
Martin’s public defenders wrote in their sentencing memorandum, obtained by CyberScoop, that in all the government’s efforts to investigate him, they did not find the NSA contractor committed treason.
“The government never uncovered any evidence that he was a traitor or a danger to our nation,” the public defenders write.
Martin will receive credit for time already served since 2016. Martin has also been sentenced to three years of supervised release.
Between 1996 and August 2016, Martin smuggled out thousands of pages of documents on classified government programs, and stored them in his home, shed, and car. The documents detailed computer infrastructure, U.S. Cyber Command targets and weaknesses as well as details on NSA capabilities, targeting information, and foreign cyber intrusion techniques. Some documents also touched on CIA foreign intelligence sources and National Reconnaissance Organization secrets.
These documents remain classified, according to the government’s sentencing memorandum.
Even though Martin knows his fate, the broader mystery surrounding the massive leak remains unresolved — just days before Martin was arrested in 2016, a group known as the Shadow Brokers began leaking classified NSA hacking tools online. A Twitter account that was allegedly Martin’s messaged someone the words “shelf life, three weeks,” according to a prior ruling from the judge. Hours later, stolen government documents were posted online, according to prosecutors. No direct link between the Shadow Brokers and Martin’s case has been made.
Bennett reminded U.S. attorneys of the tweet and the timeline on Friday in court. Assistant U.S. Attorney Zachary Myers said the U.S. government would not be commenting further than noting that the timeline is, indeed, in the facts of the case.
Jim Wyda, Martin’s public defender, said Friday there was no indication Martin intended for any transaction to take place by that tweet.
Attacks linked with the tools and clues about who may be behind the group, however, continue to surface. At least a year before the Shadow Brokers released the tools en masse in April 2017, a hacking group with ties to the Chinese government known as BuckEye was already using the tools, according to Symantec research issued this year.
It is still unknown how the Shadow Brokers gained access to the tools, whether the group had access into an NSA server to steal the or obtained them from an insider at the agency. The group is at the center of a counterintelligence investigation, as CyberScoop previously reported. The FBI would neither confirm nor deny the existence of the probe.
Hal Martin’s Mental Health
Martin’s public defenders have long argued that Martin’s mental health contributed to his theft. The sentencing memorandum submitted last week argued the same.
“As his mental health declined, Mr. Martin continued to obsessively immerse himself in work. He began taking documents and other materials home from work, initially justifying his behavior by convincing himself that it would allow him to do his job better,” his public defenders wrote. “Over time, Mr. Martin’s actions became a hoarding disorder.”
Myers told the court Friday that the U.S. government believes the way the files were found does not indicate he had a hoarding problem.
“This is not a case of hoarding, this is stealing,” Myers said Friday at a federal court house in Baltimore. The stolen information “was not in a disorganized manner,” he said, adding what the government found was “logical” and “repetitive.”
Bennett noted Friday he had concerns about the case regarding whether Martin’s alleged hoarding problem, noting that for someone who is a hoarder, he seemed well organized.
Martin began serving in the U.S. Navy on active duty in 1988, for which he maintained a secret clearance. In 1994 while serving in the U.S. Naval Reserve, his clearance was upgraded to top secret, after which he worked for several government contractors, including Booz Allen Hamilton. Between 2012 and 2015 he worked at the NSA.
Martin spoke at length Friday, reading directly from his allocution, apologizing to friends and family. He noted his methods were “uncanny” and “unauthorized, warning “please do not copy this” and that “loose lips sink ships.”
Many other NSA contractors have been caught for leaking classified information in recent years.
Last year, Reality Winner, a contractor for Pluribus International Corp., was sentenced to more than five years in prison after leaking a classified report on Russian spearphishing in the 2016 election cycle. Former NSA employee Nghia H. Pho was also sentenced last year to five-and-a-half years in prison for stealing classified hacking tools."

@_subject: Social Engineering... Jeffery Epstein' Little Girls: Israeli 
"THE HONEY TRAP ON E 71ST
by Eric Margolis NEW YORK – I’ve had many strange experiences in my decades of covering intelligence affairs. These run from being invited to KGB HQ in Moscow, Chinese intelligence in Beijing, US intelligence in Virginia, Libyan intelligence in Tripoli, South African intelligence, and even Albanian intelligence in Tirana.
But none was odder than the day I was invited to lunch in New York City with the by now notorious figure Jeffrey Epstein. The golden boy of Manhattan and Palm Beach society now sits in a grim jail cell accused of having sex with underage girls. He’s been doing this in plain view since the early 1990’s but, until recently, he seemed bullet-proof.
Soon after I walked into the entrance of Epstein’s mansion on E 71st Street, said to be the city’s largest private home, a butler asked me, ‘would you like an intimate massage, sir, by a pretty young girl?’ This offer seemed so out of place and weird to me that I swiftly declined.
More important than indelicacy, as an old observer of intelligence affairs, to me this offer reeked of ye old honey trap, a tactic to ensnare and blackmail people that was old when Babylon was young. A discreet room with massage table, lubricants and, no doubt, cameras stood ready off the main lobby.
I had arrived with Canada’s leading lady journalist who was then close to Epstein’s sometime girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell and, it was said, procuress – something Maxwell denies. Bizarrely, Maxwell believed that I could get KGB Moscow Center to release satellite photos that showed the murder on his yacht of her father, the press baron Robert Maxwell, who was a well-known double agent for Israel and KGB, and a major criminal.
Also present was the self-promoting lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, who had saved the accused murderer Claus von Bulow, as well as a titan of the New York real estate industry (not Trump) and assorted bigwigs of the city’s elite Jewish society. All sang the praises of Israel.
Epstein reportedly had ties to Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, Britain’s Prince Andrew and repeatedly flew them about in his private jet, aka ‘the Lolita Express.’ All guests deny any sexual activity. I turned down dinner with Prince Andrew.
Epstein’s residence in Manhattan and Palm Beach, both of which I visited, were stocked with young female ‘masseuses.’ All were working class girls making big money in their spare time. I did not see any interactions between these girls and the guests.
Epstein and Maxwell became too big for their britches. They flaunted their sexual adventures and laughed at New York society. Everyone wondered about the source of Epstein’s lavish income but no one knew its origins. He claimed to be an exclusive money manager for a group of secretive millionaires. But the only one identified was billionaire Leslie Wexner, the owner of L Brands and Victoria’s Secret. Wexner denied any knowledge of Epstein’s alleged crimes.
Besides sexual frolics, Epstein and Maxwell were up to many odd things. The FBI found diamonds, cash and a fake passport when raiding his mansion and documents showing his net worth at $559,120,954.00. The IRS tax people will be eager to review the sources of this income.
It seems likely that political influence was brought to bear on then US attorney Alexander Acosta (he just resigned under fire last week) to make a sweetheart deal with Epstein, who had been charged by Florida with child molestation. Epstein got off with a token, 13-month jail sentence that allowed him to work from his office much of the day.
Were Trump or Clinton involved? How much did they ‘party’ with Epstein and revel in his fleshmart? There was talk of some sort of ‘intelligence’ angle to the affaire Epstein that spared him a harsh sentence.
A respected former CIA official, Phil Giraldi has come right out and accused Epstein of being an Israeli agent of influence. Epstein was let off with a slap on the wrist on his first child abuse charge, says Giraldi, because of his powerful Israel connections. To Giraldi and this writer, the Epstein ‘massage’ operation was a classic intelligence operation designed to blackmail men of influence into doing Israel’s bidding. Clinton had reportedly already fallen into this trap years earlier while still president.
Now watch this stinking pile of corruption be hurriedly covered up. Talk about draining the swamp."

"One of the many pressing stories that remains to be told from the Snowden archive is how western intelligence agencies are attempting to manipulate and control online discourse with extreme tactics of deception and reputation-destruction. It’s time to tell a chunk of that story, complete with the relevant documents.
Over the last several weeks, I worked with NBC News to publish a series of articles about “dirty trick” tactics used by GCHQ’s previously secret unit, JTRIG (Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group). These were based on four classified GCHQ documents presented to the NSA and the other three partners in the English-speaking “Five Eyes” alliance. Today, we at the Intercept are publishing another new JTRIG document, in full, entitled “The Art of Deception: Training for Online Covert Operations.”
By publishing these stories one by one, our NBC reporting highlighted some of the key, discrete revelations: the monitoring of YouTube and Blogger, the targeting of Anonymous with the very same DDoS attacks they accuse “hacktivists” of using, the use of “honey traps” (luring people into compromising situations using sex) and destructive viruses. But, here, I want to focus and elaborate on the overarching point revealed by all of these documents: namely, that these agencies are attempting to control, infiltrate, manipulate, and warp online discourse, and in doing so, are compromising the integrity of the internet itself.

Have you ever considered the server was destroyed, stolen and turned into components for black market sale all data wiped or a thousand other possibilities?
Or is that too simple?
Maybe it was used IN an assassination by being dropped from a 6th floor window on a cheating lover?
MAYBE the server's owner murdered their Ex by doing the above?
But I jest (snigger, or perhaps not...)
I'm not following why you believe the data is actually still existent.

@_subject: RPI develops 3-D-printed living skin with blood vessels included 
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute:
"Researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute have developed a way to 3-D print living skin, complete with blood vessels. The advancement, published online today in Tissue Engineering Part A, is a significant step toward creating grafts that are more like the skin our bodies produce naturally.
"Right now, whatever is available as a clinical product is more like a fancy Band-Aid," said Pankaj Karande, an associate professor of chemical and biological engineering and member of the Center for Biotechnology and Interdisciplinary Studies (CBIS), who led this research at Rensselaer. "It provides some accelerated wound healing, but eventually it just falls off; it never really integrates with the host cells."
A significant barrier to that integration has been the absence of a functioning vascular system in the skin grafts.
Karande has been working on this challenge for several years, previously publishing one of the first papers showing that researchers could take two types of living human cells, make them into "bio-inks," and print them into a skin-like structure. Since then, he and his team have been working with researchers from Yale School of Medicine to incorporate vasculature.
In this paper, the researchers show that if they add key elements—including human endothelial cells, which line the inside of blood vessels, and human pericyte cells, which wrap around the endothelial cells—with animal collagen and other structural cells typically found in a skin graft, the cells start communicating and forming a biologically relevant vascular structure within the span of a few weeks. You can watch Karande explain this development here.
"As engineers working to recreate biology, we've always appreciated and been aware of the fact that biology is far more complex than the simple systems we make in the lab," Karande said. "We were pleasantly surprised to find that, once we start approaching that complexity, biology takes over and starts getting closer and closer to what exists in nature."
Once the Yale team grafted it onto a special type of mouse, the vessels from the skin printed by the Rensselaer team began to communicate and connect with the mouse's own vessels.
"That's extremely important, because we know there is actually a transfer of blood and nutrients to the graft which is keeping the graft alive," Karande said.
In order to make this usable at a clinical level, researchers need to be able to edit the donor cells using something like the CRISPR technology, so that the vessels can integrate and be accepted by the patient's body.
"We are still not at that step, but we are one step closer," Karande said.
"This significant development highlights the vast potential of 3-D bioprinting in precision medicine, where solutions can be tailored to specific situations and eventually to individuals," said Deepak Vashishth, the director CBIS. "This is a perfect example of how engineers at Rensselaer are solving challenges related to human health."
Karande said more work will need to be done to address the challenges associated with burn patients, which include the loss of nerve and vascular endings. But the grafts his team has created bring researchers closer to helping people with more discrete issues, like diabetic or pressure ulcers.
"For those patients, these would be perfect, because ulcers usually appear at distinct locations on the body and can be addressed with smaller pieces of skin," Karande said. "Wound healing typically takes longer in diabetic patients, and this could also help to accelerate that process." Sent from my Androgyne dee-vice with K-9 Mail

"It's not rape if you like it..."
"When Donald Trump was running for the GOP nomination, he told USA Today’s Kirsten Powers that Ayn Rand’s raped-girl-decides-she-likes-it novel, "The Fountainhead," was his favorite book."
"Welfare and other social safety net programs were, as Rand saw it, “the glorification of mediocrity” in society. Providing a social safety net for the poor, disabled, or unemployed, she believed, were part of a way of thinking that promoted, “satisfaction instead of joy, contentment instead of happiness… a glow-worm instead of a fire.”
She, like Trump, lived a largely joyless life. She mercilessly manipulated people, particularly her husband, and, like Trump, surrounded herself with cult-like followers who were only on the inside so long as they gave her total, unhesitating loyalty.
Like Trump and his billionaire backers, she believed that a government promoting working-class “looters” instead of solely looking out for capitalist “producers” was throwing its “best people” under the bus.
In Rand’s universe, the producers had no obligations to the looters. Providing welfare or sacrificing one nickel of your own money to help a “looter” on welfare, unemployment, or Social Security—particularly if it was “taken at the barrel of a gun” (taxes)—was morally reprehensible.
Like Trump saying, “My whole life I’ve been greedy,” for Rand looking out for numero uno was the singular name of the game—selfishness is next to godliness.
Later in Rand’s life, in 1959, as she gained more notoriety for the moral philosophy of selfishness that she named “Objectivism” and that is today at the core of libertarianism..."  Rand died in poverty and on welfare. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!

Meh. All pulse coded modulation messes with terrestrial use of hyper-sensitive microwave receiving equipment like Radio Astronomy gear, and it's broadband noise. In analog daze RA RF engineers used to build elaborate notch filters and such. Doesn't work with PCM, Square Waves. The 'corner' of the 'square' generates even order harmonics "from DC to Daylight". I SUPPOSE, like audio, one could use 'fast-fourier filtering' (Meyer Sound could make any room's reverberation disappear, even in Commodore/Amiga daze, and did so for the Grateful Dead for years) but I haven't heard of it, and due to the upper range of frequencies involved it would take one really fast computer and most likely machine/assembly language based software that I don't believe exists.
Regarding harmonics... In case you never noticed, blues and rock musicians who like distortion prefer tube amps which always have a touch of 'fuzz' and really go for it when driven hard. Jazz and classical musicians who like a clean sound pick transitor amps. Tube amps deliver odd order harmonics when overdriven... 1st, 3rd, 5th... as is with music. Transistor amps generate even order harmonics when pushed and sound nasty, but jazzeers and classical musicians never overdrive their amps so...
Some people... SOME PEOPLE... say the 5g fearmongering is russian influenced as a way of delaying the US 5g rollout. Most of the 5g fear-freaks I've met also think Putin is hiding in their closet, so if that's the case the 5g Russophobes are in reality "Putin's Puppets". That would be soooo apropos.

A Twitter executive, responsible for the Middle East, has been exposed as a British Army soldier active in the ‘information warfare’ unit, dedicated to propaganda, known as the 77th Brigade, an exclusive report by the U.K.-based Middle East Eye outlet has revealed. 
There are fresh questions over the relationship between social media companies and western security states after details emerged about Twitter’s high-level staff. Middle East Eye revealed that Twitter executive Gordon MacMillan is a member of the 77th Brigade of the U.K. military, which claims to have “the capability to compete in the war of narratives at the tactical level”. 
The revelations come amid recent controversies around Twitter banning accounts critical of U.S. foreign policy. In August almost 1,000 accounts that criticized ongoing protests in Hong Kong were banned from the platform.
The 77th Brigade is an amalgamation of two existing British military units, the Media Operations Group and the 15 Psychological Operations Group.
“In our 77 Brigade … we have got some remarkable talent when it comes to social media, production design," Army General Nick Carter said speaking of the mission of the brigade at a London think tank.
"We also, though, need to continue to improve our ability to fight on this new battlefield, and I think it’s important that we build on the excellent foundation we’ve created for Information Warfare through our 77 Brigade which is now giving us the capability to compete in the war of narratives at the tactical level.”
There are also concerns about the role Macmillan is playing in U.K. politics. Investigative journalist Kit Klarenberg found tweets that showed hostility towards Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who has been critical of U.K. interventions in the Middle East, “Maybe I'm just being cynical/paranoid/worse. But  tweets about Corbyn and Labour are universally negative and almost universally negative respectively,” Klarenberg commented in a tweet.  
Former soldier Joe Glenton, who was imprisoned following his refusal to return to another tour of duty in Afghanistan, and hit the headlines after attending an anti-war rally, also commented on the revelations saying “This is vital journalism. It adds to concerns I have had about the placement and role of 77 Brigade people in public life more generally."  
Both Twitter and the 77th Brigade claim that they do not have a formal link.

"Network data from the NetBlocks internet observatory show that Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram and other social and messaging apps have been blocked in Iraq by multiple internet providers as of 12:30 UTC, Wednesday 2 October 2019.
The restrictions come just as hundreds have been reported wounded as police fire tear gas, bullets at protesters.
Technical measurements show that each of the services have been intentionally restricted by leading Iraqi network operators including Earthlink, Asiacell and Zain in a manner consistent with previous incidents of censorship in the country. Findings are based on a set of technical measurements from across the country assessing reachability and network performance.
Update: Internet access has been cut across much of Iraq including Baghdad as of 17:00 UTC, following the earlier blocking of social media platforms. NetBlocks diffscan measurements which map the IP space of a country show significant impact across multiple providers. Nationwide connectivity has fallen below 70% and outages continue to spread:
Update: As of 19:30 UTC Iraq has gone largely offline amid widening mass-protests, with the situation on the ground unclear due to blackouts. Real-time network data show approximately 75% of the country including Baghdad is now offline, excluding autonomous regions which operate their own networks:
Instances of network filtering and outages present a significant challenge to media freedom and the rights to free assembly and free association in Iraq.
Why are Iraqis protesting?
Demonstrators are out on the streets over unemployment, corruption and poor public services, focused in capital Baghdad but also impacting other cities around Iraq.
The protests have escalated after police opened fire in the air as some 3,000 protesters tried to cross a bridge leading into Baghdad’s fortified Green Zone, where government buildings and foreign embassies are based.
Is the internet down in Iraq?
Yes, largely. Restrictions were initially limited to specific online platforms and at first there was no sign of a wider nationwide internet blackout. However total outages began from 17:00 UTC, and by 19:30 UTC much of Iraq fell offline (see updates, above).
Geographic impact covers Iraq’s centrally administered cities including Baghdad, while independent zones such as the Kurdish northern cities are governed under a different system unaffected by the restrictions.
Iraq has previously extended social media disruptions to total shutdowns, hence the situation has been considered volatile by the observatory from its onset.
On Wednesday afternoon, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger remained partially usable via mobile phones on some of the affected networks for some time. This is due to circumvention measures and alternative messaging protocols built into recent versions of the mobile apps. In such cases service quality and performance of media, photo and video transfers are generally degraded.
NetBlocks has previously identified the total blocking of internet access as well as partial restrictions affecting social media platforms through recent years. Civil society group SMEX has campaigned for rights-based internet governance in the region."

The Future of the Spectacle … or How the West Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Reality Police
"If you want a vision of the future, don’t imagine “a boot stamping on a human face — for ever,” as Orwell suggested in 1984. Instead, imagine that human face staring mesmerized into the screen of some kind of nifty futuristic device on which every word, sound, and image has been algorithmically approved for consumption by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (“DARPA”) and its “innovation ecosystem” of “academic, corporate, and governmental partners.” The screen of this futuristic device will offer a virtually unlimited range of “non-divisive” and “hate-free” content, none of which will falsify or distort the “truth,” or in any way deviate from “reality.” Western consumers will finally be free to enjoy an assortment of news, opinion, entertainment, and educational content (like this Guardian podcast about a man who gave birth, or MSNBC’s latest bombshell about Donald Trump’s secret Russian oligarch backers) without having their enjoyment totally ruined by discord-sowing alternative journalists like Aaron Maté or satirists like myself.
“Fake news” will not appear on this screen. All the news will be “authentic.” DARPA and its partners will see to that. You won’t have to worry about being “influenced” by Russians, Nazis, conspiracy theorists, socialists, populists, extremists, or whomever. Such Persons of Malicious Intent will still be able to post their content (because of “freedom of speech” and all that stuff), but they will do so down in the sewers of the Internet where normal consumers won’t have to see it. Anyone who ventures down there looking for it (i.e., such “divisive” and “polarizing” content) will be immediately placed on an official DARPA watchlist for “potential extremists,” or “potential white supremacists,” or “potential Russians.”

The company Nazis keep! Just wonder if they use pink hearts too?
"Islamic State propagandists are reportedly trying to exploit social media app TikTok as a recruiting tool. The Wall Street Journal says social media monitoring agency Storyful recently identified around two dozen ISIS-related accounts, all of which have since been removed. The accounts posted videos aimed at recruiting followers and bolstering support for the terrorist group — featuring Islamic State anthems and footage of corpses and ISIS fighters.
It’s not clear how big a presence ISIS has on TikTok. Terrorist propaganda is a perennial issue for social media platforms. Companies like Facebook and Google share a database of known terrorist imagery that can be automatically removed when it’s detected online. They’ve also faced (and won) several lawsuits for allowing it even temporarily on their platforms. Facebook said in September that it removed more than 26 million pieces of global terrorist propaganda over the past two years. TikTok’s parent company ByteDance didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about how much terrorist content TikTok finds and takes down.
The accounts that Storyful identified also appear to be relatively small. The Journal identifies one video as earning 68 likes and some accounts as having around 1,000 followers; Storyful didn’t immediately confirm whether that’s typical of the accounts’ popularity, or whether these are the first accounts they’ve found on TikTok.
TikTok videos circulate largely thanks to TikTok’s recommendation algorithm. And in this case, it’s not clear that the algorithm is promoting ISIS content, just that this content exists on the hugely popular platform. However, as the Journal notes, TikTok has a young user base and is known for lighthearted, joke-y content — sometimes to the point of alleged political censorship. So there’s an added incongruity when it’s used by terrorists." Sent from my Androgyne dee-vice with K-9 Mail

@_subject: Whodathunkit? CIA, FBI computers used for Wikipedia edits 
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - People using CIA and FBI computers have edited entries in the online encyclopedia Wikipedia on topics including the Iraq war and the Guantanamo prison, according to a new tracing program.
A screenshot of Wikipedia.com, taken on August 16, 2007. (image onsite) The changes may violate Wikipedia’s conflict-of-interest guidelines, a spokeswoman for the site said on Thursday.
The program, WikiScanner, was developed by Virgil Griffith of the Santa Fe Institute in New Mexico and posted this month on a Web site that was quickly overwhelmed with searches.
The program allows users to track the source of computers used to make changes to the popular Internet encyclopedia where anyone can submit and edit entries.
WikiScanner revealed that CIA computers were used to edit an entry on the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. A graphic on casualties was edited to add that many figures were estimated and were not broken down by class.
Another entry on former CIA chief William Colby was edited by CIA computers to expand his career history and discuss the merits of a Vietnam War rural pacification program that he headed.
Aerial and satellite images of the U.S. prison for terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, were removed using a computer traced to the FBI, WikiScanner showed.
CIA spokesman George Little said he could not confirm whether CIA computers were used in the changes, adding that “the agency always expects its computer systems to be used responsibly.”
The FBI did not have an immediate response.
Computers at numerous other organizations and companies were found to have been involved in editing articles related to them.
Griffith said he developed WikiScanner “to create minor public relations disasters for companies and organizations I dislike (and) to see what ‘interesting organizations’ (which I am neutral towards) are up to.”
It was not known whether changes were made by an official representative of an agency or company, Griffith said, but it was certain the change was made by someone with access to the organization’s network.
It violates Wikipedia’s neutrality guidelines for a person with close ties to an issue to contribute to an entry about it, said spokeswoman Sandy Ordonez of the Wikimedia Foundation, Wikipedia’s parent organization.
However, she said, “Wikipedia is self-correcting,” meaning misleading entries can be quickly revised by another editor. She said Wikimedia welcomed the WikiScanner.

Let's 'portray his origins' for the record... Camp Bucca, bucko! Just another person tortured into becoming a terrorist. They grow in the fertile ground where innocent blood is spilled you know? His replacement is also a Bucca 'graduate', and allegedly a "Saddamist", which means Bucca totally radicalized him because Baathists were hardly radical, and it's interesting to note, despite much original mouth noise from the Pentagram regarding Saddam's former army folks and ISIS this IS the first reference I've ever seen to an individual who fits that profile.
Here's some boilerplate from a couple of Pepe Escobar's FB posts on the topic along with my commentary.
"Nya Nya Nya! The Kurds stole your underwear!
Suppose he's hanging out with Jamal Kashoggi on some merc-secured Bahamian island sipping Mai Tais in the evening breeze? Or perhaps it's some island in Archipelago Of Palau where the Gitmo Uigurs were sent, in return for a little US largess? From 2009: "At the Guantanamo concentration camp, Chinese Uighurs, mountain people, who were ordered freed years ago, are going to be relocated to Palau, South Pacific. More: Pepe Escobar: So this is the narrative being sold by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They had collected his stolen underwear in advance (a Syrian Kurd mole). But he exploded himself, so there was not much left (by the way, what happened to his three children hostages, also buried under the collapsing tunnel?) Anyway they collected the debris in sealed plastic bags, and took it to a nearby“ secure facility to confirm his identity with forensic DNA testing”. They did it in a flash. Then, assuming after the long flight back (70 minutes) to Irbil in Iraqi Kurdistan, the fake Caliph was given a “proper burial at sea” in accordance with Islamic tradition (where? The Eastern Mediterranean? The Persian Gulf? The Strait of Hormuz? The Black Sea? That’s a lot of flying back and forth, again). It would be fascinating to watch how to provide a proper burial to a sealed plastic bag. Anyway nobody is goin’ to see anything about the “complete disposal” because of the “declassification process”. See you on Netflix." Earlier Escobar pointed out the Russian saw no unusual flight activity NOR HAD THEY BEEN CONTACTED by the Pentagram OR Trump...
Deafening silence from the Mission Accomplished side. They also said it makes no sense that the Caliph was in a cauldron, Idlib, controlled by Jabhat al-Nusra, a.k.a. al-Qaeda in Syria, who hates his guts - and not ISIS/Daesh. Deafening silence from the Mission Accomplished side.
But I had already written: EVERYONE thinks Trump is Putin's Poochie again because he called the Russians to inform them of the al-Baghdadi operation, but not Nancy Pelosi. The point is the White House NOR the Pentagon wanted Russian soldiers on the ground PATROLLING LEGALLY in Syria to interfere with their 2001 AUMF-driven assassination operation by troops illegally in Syria, and Nancy Pelosi? Exactly WHY did she need to know?
Pelosi is a well-known security risk... A leaker. For money, and for political gain..

@_subject: 'Call it the Surge': Trump vows tougher militarized police; 
Shades of Richard Nixon! The "Silent Majority" 'told him' to do it. In this case the little hitler in Trump's head told him to. Maybe Trump doesn't remember how many cops got hurt and killed from the late 60s until the Vietnam War ended when Nixon tried it. After all he'd never heard of 'homelessness' until a few months ago. I'm SURE he never heard the chant: "We're bringing the war back home" used by armed protesters either... Tis a shame.
"In coming weeks, Attorney General Barr will announce a new crackdown on violent crime—which I think is so important—targeting gangs and drug traffickers in high crime cities and dangerous rural areas," Trump said during the International Association of Chiefs of Police conference in Chicago. "Let's call it the surge."
The president did not provide any details on the plan but said it is going to be "very dramatic."
"And you're going to see tremendous results very quickly," Trump added.
As if to emphasize his view of America's cities as war zones, Trump went on to tout his administration's success in putting military equipment into the hands of U.S. police officers and claimed "Afghanistan is a safe place" compared to Chicago.
"To help keep you safe, I've made $600 million-worth of surplus military equipment available to local law enforcement," Trump told the audience of police chiefs. "If you remember, the previous administration didn't want to do that... They didn't want to make you look so tough. They didn't want to make you look like you're a threat."
Watch Trump's remarks:
Trump's visit to Chicago, the first of his presidency, was met with massive protests led by Indivisible Chicago and other progressive advocacy groups. Striking Chicago public school teachers also cleared their Monday afternoon schedule to take part in demonstrations against the president.
"We have heard that President Donald Trump might be in town," leaders of the Chicago Teachers Union wrote in an email to members late Sunday. "If any members were inclined to show up outside his fundraiser in red, that would qualify as productive, in our view.”
Thousands of protesters gathered and marched outside the Trump International Hotel and Tower in downtown Chicago, where the president attended a big-money campaign fundraiser after the law enforcement conference:
"We're angry," Marj Halperin of Indivisible Chicago told The Guardian. "He is taking pleasure in the misery of our city. He doesn't know us. He's coming to our city to raise money, largely from people who don't live in this city, without ever having addressed, supported, listened to the people who really need help."

Warehouses are designed not to spontaneously collapse.
The shelving is made of steel, which melts at 1510 C, and this temperature could not have been reached under warehouse lighting conditions.

@_subject: Another Network Is Possible: Indymedia; 
The streets that night were carless. They were blocked, but there was no room for cars anyway. There were thousands of people outside. Some were running, some were locked arm-in-arm. Others were clad in full body armor — those were the Seattle Police. The cops wore helmets with screens to shield them from the smoke grenades and tear gas they were spraying directly into the crowds, forcing people coughing and crying down to the pavement, which was covered in glass from chain-store windows smashed by roaming protesters. “You suck, you fucking cocksucker,” a man yelled as an officer in front of him began firing rubber bullets that left painful welts on the legs and arms of the people they hit. 
That night, November 30, 1999, the opening ceremony of the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference was supposed to be held. But demonstrators had taken over the city, confining the world leaders from over 150 governments who had arrived in Seattle to participate in the round of global trade negotiations to their hotel lobbies. At one point, the action moved to a street downtown where a group of activist-journalists had set up a newsroom in a donated storefront. They called it the Seattle Independent Media Center (IMC). As smoke thickened the autumn air, protesters poured inside to seek refuge from the tear gas that made it nearly impossible to see and even harder to breathe. The cops tried to follow them in, but those inside quickly locked the doors. Their cameras were rolling, filming the police the whole time. This was where Indymedia was born.
The Seattle IMC was stocked with donated computers for uploading and editing video and for writing articles. This content would then be posted to a website, indymedia.org, which went live days before the protests began. The motivation behind opening an activist newsroom, according to Jeff Perlstein, one of the founders of the Seattle IMC, was to provide a different perspective on the protests than corporate media. “We couldn’t just let CNN and CBS be the ones to tell these stories,” said Perlstein in a 2000 interview. “We needed to develop our own alternatives and networks. That’s where the idea for the media center came from — the necessity for communities to control their own message.” 
It worked. During the WTO meetings, IMC journalists provided up-to-the-minute coverage and produced daily video segments. The Indymedia website clocked in 1.5 million unique visitors in its first week of operation, surpassing traffic to CNN’s website during the Seattle protests.
The success of the Indymedia website and the Seattle IMC newsroom behind it soon inspired the formation of local IMCs and websites in other cities around the world, where they duplicated the publishing platform developed for Seattle. By 2004, there were over 150 autonomously operated IMCs in some fifty countries across the globe, which all ran websites that branched off the mothership: indymedia.org. What started in Seattle grew into a network. 
This was at the turn of the millenium, when the anti-globalization movement was in full swing. Activists in North America and Europe mounted major protests against powerful multinational corporations and the international agreements that empowered them. Indymedia’s founding members understood that defeating this enemy would require taking on some of its traits. A movement to oppose globalized, networked capital needed to be globalized and networked too. And that meant getting online. 
An Anti-Capitalist Internet 
Indymedia activists wanted to build an alternative media system. They wanted to use the internet to circumvent institutional power. But they weren’t the only ones. Another, more influential group of digital pioneers in the 1990s had a similar idea: the techno-libertarians, who dreamt of building a boundless digital future where inhabitants could craft their own rules, free from the confines of government control. The philosophy of techno-libertarianism was most famously articulated by Grateful Dead lyricist and Electronic Frontier Foundation co-founder John Perry Barlow in his “Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace.”
“Governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed. You have neither solicited nor received ours… Cyberspace does not lie within your borders,” Barlow wrote in his Declaration, which he penned at the World Economic Forum, of all places, in Davos in 1996. While Indymedia organizers shared Barlow’s image of cyberspace as borderless, anti-hierarchical, and anti-institutional, they were guided by a very different political vision. 
The same year that Barlow published his manifesto, Subcomandante Marcos offered his. Marcos was the spokesman of the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN), a rebel group of primarily poor and rural indigenous people in Chiapas that took up arms when Mexico signed the North American Free Trade Agreement. From the start, the EZLN used the internet to get the word out about their deadly struggle against the Mexican government. In 1996, at an anti-globalization conference held in Chiapas, Marcos laid out his vision for how social movements could harness the internet:
We will make a network of communication among all our struggles and resistances. An intercontinental network of alternative communication against neoliberalism… This intercontinental network of alternative communication will be the medium by which distinct resistance’s communicate with one another.
The organizers who went on to build Indymedia heard this call. Marcos’s “intercontinental network of alternative communication,” as Todd Wolfson chronicles in his book, Digital Rebellion: The Birth of the Cyber Left, provided the guiding inspiration for the formation of Indymedia. 
The Indymedia organizers would be the children of Marcos, not Barlow. While the two philosophies had points of contact, they came from different places of concern. Indymedia activists would agree with the techno-libertarians that politicians and police couldn’t be trusted in their networks. But they didn’t see cyberspace as an open frontier of individuals unhindered by governments. Rather, the activists saw cyberspace as a place for communities. 
They drew from a history of community media and radical self-publishing, which emphasized the need for those who are marginalized and silenced by mainstream media to share stories, cultivate solidarity, and build grassroots power. For Indymedia, the internet was a gathering place: a space not merely for individual liberation but collective liberation, where communities and movements could communicate, consolidate, and form a “network of resistance,” as Marcos put it, against government and corporate control. 
Yet it was Barlow’s vision that attracted entrepreneurs like Eric Schmidt and Steve Wozniak, who hoped to carve out new markets in a digital world unbound by national borders and government regulations. For the techno-libertarians, a healthy internet was one where people could do and say whatever they pleased. Protecting individual rights of self-expression took precedence over protecting marginalized communities — who, in practice, don’t always get to enjoy the same rights. 
Today, techno-libertarianism has terminated in a corporatized internet, where individuals can express almost anything they want, so long as their speech is monetized by a handful of big platforms. Only recently have these platforms been forced to reckon with the problems that have plagued communities of minority users for years. Meanwhile, corporations like Facebook and Google, rife with hate speech and funded by surveillance, lack a clear understanding of how to serve the information needs of the diversity of users worldwide who depend on them.
In contrast to the digital frontiersman of Barlow’s declaration, Indymedia activists built a platform that prioritized communities. Within Indymedia, communities built their own trusted online spaces. Autonomous groups were then connected to others in a common network, with the aim of providing mutual support and mounting resistance to institutional power. 
Opening Doors with Open Publishing
When Indymedia was at its height between 1999 and 2006, new IMCs were going online at a rate of one every nine days. Many were started to support anti-globalization protests, like in Seattle in 1999. The Indymedia center in Miami, for example, started in 2003 in the aftermath of the Free Trade Area of the Americas meeting, when labor organizers, farm workers, and anti-globalization demonstrators descended on the city to protest the trade negotiations. 
Though many IMCs formed in response to local anti-globalization actions, like the one in Miami, starting a new Indymedia site wasn’t bound to that movement. The IMC in Philadelphia, for example, emerged in preparation for the protests surrounding the Republican National Convention in 2000. Others were built as general-purpose outlets for local activism. One of the first projects of the San Francisco Bay Area IMC — later known as “Indybay” —  was a list of the forty-five worst slumlords in the city. Indymedia journalists compiled the list after interviewing and meeting with local tenants’ rights advocates in response to rising rents during the dot-com boom.
Whether an IMC was started to cover an anti-globalization protest or to serve as a community media outpost, one thing they all shared was a website with some level of “open publishing.” This meant it had a usable interface that made it relatively easy for anyone to post on the central newswire. Most Indymedia sites had three columns (similar to Facebook today). The left column had a menu for navigating to other local IMCs. The center column was a feed of stories, and the right column was usually reserved for submitting a post or listing calendar events. “It was the first self-publishing platform I had encountered,” Lee Azzarello, who started working with the Indymedia center in New York City in 2001 and helped with global Indymedia tech support, told me, echoing other IMC members I interviewed. “This was before WordPress existed and blogs took some expertise to start and use.” 
Open publishing also opened the doors to abuse. “We had constant battles with trolls the whole time,” Mark Burdett, an Indymedia veteran and former colleague from EFF, told me in an interview. One key way that Indymedia sites dealt with trolling was by having an editorial policy: members who monitored the posts submitted to the newswire used the policy to decide what got promoted to the top. But as more people used Indymedia sites, the more the trolls and spammers did too. Indymedia organizers eventually built tools that automatically detected spam or hateful content to flag for review before it was allowed to go live. 
Issues with trolling, however, never eclipsed the real appeal of open publishing: it provided an easy-to-use platform which non-tech experts could use to elevate their stories online. Activists had long recognized that skewed narratives and silences from corporate media were part of what they had to fight in order to mount political resistance. Even so, those who were in a position to write and publish stories to counteract the mainstream media were relatively few and far between, relying on community radio and public access television, newsletters, or individual blogs. 
With Indymedia, thousands of people were publishing stories and sharing photos and videos across movements and across the world. Indymedia’s open source codebase, of which multiple versions emerged over the years, had been created specifically for this purpose. As Mansur Jacobi and Matthew Arnison, software programmers who were core in developing the open-publishing framework for Indymedia, put it in the very first post published to the Seattle site:
The web dramatically alters the balance between multinational and activist media. With just a bit of coding and some cheap equipment, we can set up a live automated website that rivals the corporates. Prepare to be swamped by the tide of activist media makers on the ground in Seattle and around the world, telling the real story behind the World Trade [Organization].
The site’s open-publishing architecture presaged the social media networks that would begin to emerge years later and eventually subsume how we communicate online. 
Tech Taking a Backseat
Although open publishing was key to the success of Indymedia, the technical aspects alone weren’t what attracted its user base. Just as important were the anti-capitalist and justice-centered values. I came to the Tennessee Indymedia Center’s website, tnimc.org, to write and read stories about how people in Nashville, my hometown, were dying because of cuts to state health care, about how coal extraction had decimated whole mountains and polluted local water supplies, about how police were increasing their presence in public schools. 
Local corporate media at the time were either ignoring these issues or, if they were covering them, failed to consistently center the voices of the people and communities affected. Our thinking was that it would be awfully hard to change local policy if our neighbors didn’t know what was happening, and we couldn’t count on the mainstream media to make people understand enough to care. In this way, as grassroots journalists on Indymedia, our work was tactical. We were reporting with an agenda. 
Other Indymedia organizers and activists I spoke to felt similarly. “Self-publishing is great. I’m into it,” an early organizer of Indybay told me, who asked to remain anonymous. “But I feel like the main strength of Indymedia was this idea about tactical media. There’s like a purpose to what you’re doing that’s not just about publishing your story.” If you hung around Indymedia types during the early 2000s, there’s a good chance you heard the term “tactical media” batted around. What differentiates tactical media from some imaginary idea of pure journalism is that tactical media is made in support of a political project.
The autonomy of each Indymedia site gave local activist-journalists the flexibility to support different political projects, and to respond to the informational needs of their community. In 2005, for example, the Houston IMC teamed up with the community radio advocacy non-profit Prometheus Radio Project to set up a low-power FM radio station at the Astrodome, where thousands of people displaced from Hurricane Katrina were relocated. As Tish Stringer, a founding member of the Houston IMC, told Democracy Now at the time, “There was a real difficulty getting information for basic things like when to eat, where to eat, how to get my child into school, how to look for jobs, transportation — really basic issues… Media activists in Houston talked about this and decided really radio would be the perfect medium to address this.” 
Within days, the Indymedia activists were able to secure three emergency low-power FM licenses. They handed out small donated radios to people inside, set up a studio in an Airstream trailer in the parking lot, and began broadcasting by helping evacuees find missing friends and family members. The station provided critical information about how to apply for aid and aired firsthand accounts from survivors who made it from Louisiana to Texas. Media activists were helping to alleviate the information crisis by connecting families in the Astrodome — all the while producing boots-on-the-ground coverage that people could follow around the world.
The internet wasn’t in everyone’s pocket in the early 2000s and, as illustrated by the Houston activists who broadcast at the Astrodome, publishing online didn’t make sense for reaching people who don’t have the resources to get online. Sakura Sanders, an anti-mining activist who worked on Fault Lines, the printed newspaper of Indybay, explained why their Indymedia collective and so many others found it critical to run a print newspaper: “Online is great for reaching people who already know about you. But this was before social media, so unless you actually went to Indybay deliberately, it’s not like you were going to see these stories posted on someone’s Facebook. Fault Lines was essential to reach beyond the choir. We would leave it at various cafes and stuff.” 
Beyond newspapers and radio stations, it was common for Indymedia websites to run their own physical space with a community computer lab, video editing stations, art supplies, and a meeting room for local organizing. Indymedia sites were networked online, but as primarily local projects, it was essential to exist offline too. This was in part because Indymedia was a creature of an earlier digital era, before social media and smartphones. But the benefits of the localism this strategy engendered shouldn’t be lost on us today: in order to serve their communities, organizers had to be present offline too. 
Missing Links
The last post on indymedia.org is dated September 2017. New Orleans’ Indymedia site, neworleans.indymedia.org, was last updated in October 2013. Others are still quite active, like the Indymedia site used across Argentina, argentina.indymedia.org, which is updated multiple times a week, sometimes multiple times a day. When I visited the Tennessee IMC’s website this spring, the domain had expired. I texted my friend who helped maintain the site. “Guess I forgot to pay the yearly fee,” they replied. 
Indymedia sites around the US started to atrophy around 2008. The network’s decentralization had a double edge. Local outlets had the autonomy to directly serve their communities. But without strong, centralized accountability, it was often difficult to apply for funding or develop leadership that would help ensure sustainability. In 2002, for example, a Ford Foundation grant was disputed because of the foundation’s suspected ties to the Central Intelligence Agency, which was pointed out in an emergency email to the global network by the Argentina IMC shortly before the money was slated to be accepted. 
People also burned out. As a volunteer project, those who did have the time and resources to work for free tended come from some level of privilege. Stronger centralization might have provided the tools needed for leadership training, which would have helped to bring new volunteers in and diversify core organizers. 
The anti-globalization movement that helped give Indymedia a pillar around which the network could coalesce also began to weaken as political concerns shifted over the years, and Indymedia organizers never landed on a new movement that could unite and guide the tactical work of the collective. IMCs always covered more than the anti-globalization and anti-war activism of the early 2000s, but the loose network benefited from having a broader social movement that it could embed itself within. 
Anti-globalization activism provided a shared purpose around which to converge nationally. Activists met at protests around the country, and IMCs filled a need by providing media and tech services for the movement. By the time Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter hit the scene in the United States, Indymedia projects had been winding down for years. 
Tomorrow, in Hindsight 
Today, social movements depend on Facebook, Google, and Twitter. It’s been a tremendous boost in terms of organizing and lifting stories to reach new audiences. These platforms also connect otherwise disparate users who share a political critique to raise their voice together to force institutional change. Some may call this a “Twitter mob.” Others see it as an essential tool for accountability when there’s no other lever to pull, like creating an uproar that persuades the New York Times to dismiss an opinion columnist for her ties to an infamous Neo-Nazi, or that pushes Google to disband an AI “ethics board” because it included the transphobic head of the Heritage Foundation. 
But many are also aware that reliance on corporations like Facebook and Google means giving up control over how we communicate. Someone may ascend to represent a movement online without actually taking part in grassroots advocacy to support it. Going viral gives the impression that an idea is gaining traction, but the constant flow of information required to fuel unending engagement on these sites means something else is bound to go viral soon. It’s difficult to hold anyone’s attention. 
“Social media companies are making money off the hard work that we are doing, and it’s devalued the way we organize online,” Vanessa Butterworth, an environmental justice organizer, lamented to me in an interview. “Back in the day we had more in-person communication. And I feel like that showing up, whether it’s in the streets or organizing meetings or whatever — that’s slowly dying. It’s the personalized connection we’re losing.” 
A revitalization of an Indymedia-like project today would never be a replacement for the platforms that are so intertwined with our lives. But it could provide a welcome retreat, a place online that is less tethered to corporate interests, where activists across movements locally and globally can share stories, calendars, and concerns without feeding Facebook and Google’s advertising empire. 
When social movements share infrastructure that they own, it’s easier to support each other. When we share space, we can begin to build the type of world we’re striving towards. That may mean online communication channels that ban racism and forums that respect privacy from the start. It could mean building archives to store photos and videos of social movements in such a way that facial recognition is prohibited, the files can be deleted at any time, and nobody is profiting off of every view. If there’s ever a future where we can begin to reimagine the internet as a commons, rather than a shopping mall with a handful of big-box platforms that extract our data and our time, building our own network may be a good start. 
But in order for anything to last, it has to be used. A resource is used when it’s serving a purpose and there are people at the center keeping it strong. If a new leftist network is built today, its nodes should strive to support a unifying concern on a global or national scale, like immigration, racial justice, or environmental destruction, while remaining deeply connected to local communities and their own particular informational needs. Now might be the perfect time to build something new. The corporations that form our digital sphere are facing a political crisis. They’ve become conduits for violent hate around the world and have made our elections awful. Indymedia shouldn’t be replicated — it was nowhere near perfect. But its example reminds us that a better internet is possible, if we are willing to build it.

"The immigration agency had sought to redact the location of the new training facility, but failed to do so properly. The agency, which has made this kind of mistake previously, appears to have a systemic information-security problem.
In this case, Newsweek was able to simply copy and paste the document's contents into a word processor and quickly establish that the facility would be built at the Office of Firearms and Tactical Programs' (OFTP) Tactical Operations Complex (TOC) at Fort Benning, Georgia, a U.S. Army post used to prepare soldiers for combat.
In addition to revealing Fort Benning as the location of the training site, ICE also failed to properly redact information indicating that the Army post would be getting an expansion, with up to 50 buildings expected to be added to the site.
"A Blanket Purchase Agreement (BPA) vehicle will be competed among GSA Federal Supply Schedule holders for additional training buildings and interior/exterior outfitting in the first quarter of Fiscal Year 20," ICE states in a portion it did not attempt to redact from the document.
In a following partially redacted line, it states: "OFTP plans to expand the Training Site at Ft. Benning to include up to 50 additional buildings and add additional U.S. city layouts and designs."
Throughout the document, areas that were meant to be withheld were not redacted properly, including signature lines at the bottom of the document. Instead of names, these would-be redacted lines contain what appears to be placeholders, such as "ijunynyhhjhjhjjjjjjj," "hnjumgfrdddfffffff" and "BHMKKOOOOOO."
ICE's new training facility is expected to include,"at a minimum," a "multitude of basic, intermediate and hyper-realistic training devices, a tactical training warehouse, classroom facilities and vehicle assault training area."
Among those training devices will be a "hyper-realistic props/design" that simulates "residential houses, apartments, hotels, government facilities and commercial buildings," along with other training configurations.
ICE is specifically interested in acquiring a "Chicago" style replica, as well as an "Arizona" style replica, with the agency expecting to dedicate a total estimated value of $961,347.75 to the effort."

"The economy doesn't make stuff anymore. That much you know. So what does it make?
It makes assholes.
The Great Enterprise of this Age is the Asshole Industry."
My good friend Mara has not one but two graduate degrees. From fine, storied universities. Surprise, surprise: the only "job" she was able to find was at a retail store.
Hey - it's only minimum wage, but at least she's working, right? And at a major-league, blue-chip company, An American icon; an institution; a name every man, woman, and child in this country knows; an historic company that rings of the American Dream the world over, besides. Surely, if nothing else, it's a start
Perhaps you're right. Maybe it isn't the start she always dreamed of ... but at least it is one. If so ... then awaits her at the finish?
What is Mara's job like? Her sales figures are monitored ... by the microsecond. By hidden cameras and mics. They listen to her every word; they capture her every movement; that track and stalk her as if she were an animal; or a prisoner; or both. She's jacked into a headset that literally barks algorithmic, programmed "orders" at her, parroting her own "performance" back to her, telling her how she compares with quotas calculated ... down to the second ... for all the hundreds of items in the store ... which recites "influence and manipulation techniques" to her ... to use on unsuspecting customers ... that sound suspiciously like psychological warfare. It's as if the NSA was following you around ... and it was stuck in your head ... telling you what an inadequate failure you were ... psychologically waterboarding you ... all day long ... every day for the rest of your life.
Mara's boss sits in the back. Monitoring all twelve, or fifteen, or twenty people that work in the store. On a set of screens. Half camera displays, half spreadsheets; numbers blinking in real-time. Glued to it like a zombie. Chewing slowly with her mouth open. Jacked into a headset. A drone-pilot ... piloting a fleet of human drones ... pressure-selling disposable mass-made shit ... as if it were luxury yachts ... through robo-programmed info-warfare ... like zombies ... to other zombies ... who look stunned ... like they just got laser blasted, cluster-bombed, shock-and-awed ...
It's bananas. The whole scene is like a maximum-security mental asylum designed by sadomasochists in a sci-fi movie. If Jeffrey Dahmer, Rasputin, and Michael Bay designed a "store" together, they couldn't do any better. Her "job" will begin to drive her crazy - paranoid, depressed, deluded - in a matter of years if she continues doing it. No human psyche can bear that kind of relentless, systematic abuse.
Now. Note what all the technology and bureaucracy that wonderful, noble company has invested hundreds of millions in doesn't ask her to do. Learn. Think. Reflect. Teach. Inspire. Lead. Connect. Imagine. Create. Grow. Dream. Actually ... serve customers.
Heaven forbid. It just beats her over the head, over and over again, three times a minute, every twenty seconds, with how much she hasn't sold; hasn't made; hasn't produced. For her shitty .0003% commission. According to the quota that's been set for her. By her boss. For his boss. For their boss. And so on all the way up the food chain.
See my point? Mara's job isn't to benefit customers. It isn't to educate, understand, listen to, or even to chat with them. It isn't to stop them from buying what they don't want; to help them find what they might need; to match them with the right stuff. Nope. It's merely to push more and more and more and more shit at them ... faster, meaner, and dumber than any sane person would think is humanly possible ... using advanced military technology and techniques ... programmed to abuse her ... so she can wage advanced psychological warfare ... on her customers. And they were just suckers, gaping maws, fools, marks. And be yelled at ... by a robot ... if she doesn't.
Really? This is the best our economy can do? To take the stuff of 21st century warfare and use them them to ... rack up the profit? To turn a bright young woman with two graduate degrees ... into a Superprofitable Human Weapon of Mass Consumption ... a half-crazed algorithmically-programmed asshole ... a human drone ... so even bigger, actually crazy assholes ... can get super-rich ... by slinging entire supertankers full of junk ... at people getting poorer at four thousand percent interest a year ... by using drones and bots to wage psychological warfare against them ... so they're conned into buying too much?
The economy doesn't make stuff anymore. That much you know. So what does it make?
It makes assholes.
The Great Enterprise of this Age is the Asshole Industry.
And that's not just a tragedy. It is something approaching the moral equivalent of a crime. For it demolishes human potential in precisely the same way as locking someone innocent up, and throwing away the key.
Consider Mara again. Who in Christ's name would design such an inhuman system? Whose sick joke of an idea is a "store" like that? What do you even call it? Because it's surely not a "store".
Only a monstrous asshole of the highest order could assemble such a demonically vampiric bullshit machine to prey on ... everyone. Customers, managers, workers alike. Such a carefully sophisticated engine of human misery; of finessed cruelty; all to rake in a few extra pennies an hour, at the expense of dignity, intelligence, creativity, commitment, fairness, craft, service, sovereignty ... sanity.
The Store is an Asshole Factory.
Allow me to explain.
What happens to Mara when she's "doing her job"? Think about it for a second. She turns into precisely the kind of asshole that the heartless dweebs who thought up this infernal torture-machine no doubt already are. Not because she wants to. But because she has to.
That's exactly what the store was designed to do. Turn everyone into the same kind of asshole as the assholes that made it, run it, and benefit from it ... want everyone to be.
The Store is an Asshole Factory.
Our world is now full of Asshole Factories. That's what the stores, offices, industrial parks, skyscrapers, malls, low-rise blocks, gleaming headquarters, whimsically designed corporate campuses, really are.
It's the grand endeavor of today. We don't make stuff anymore. We make assholes. The Great Enterprise of this age is the Asshole Industry.
Consider, for a moment, my tiny hypothesis.
Have you noticed, lately, that people seem to be more, well, assholish ... than before? That everywhere you go, people seem to be meaner, nastier, dumber, angrier, more brutish?
It is the last and greatest industry left in an economy that has been impoverished, emptied, hollowed out, drained.
The Great Enterprise of the Age of Stagnation is the wholesale manufacture not of great, world-shaking, ground-breaking ideas, inventions, concerns ... but of bigger and bigger assholes.
The chain-store; the mall; the hypermarket. The corporation; the firm; the partnership. Business school; law school; medical school. The boardroom; the backroom; the trading floor.
These are, by and large, Asshole Factories. They don't make people. Capable of great things. Who create and build and touch and soar. They make assholes.
They are designed to disinfect us of our fragility. To cleanse us of our flaws. To disinfect us of weakness. Love, grace, mercy, longing, forgiveness, passion, truth, nobility, dreams. Their objective is to stamp all that out; to eradicate it; to erase it. To replace it with calculation, ruthlessness, self-concern, gluttony, cruelty, anxiety, despair. By using the most sophisticated technology ever made to subjugate, oppress, and goad us into being little torturers ourselves.
And in so doing, they emotionally sterilize us. They psychically traumatize us. They intellectually castrate us. They socially neuter us. They cheat us of greatness. That is how they turn us into assholes.
They are designed to deprive us into depriving everyone else of the lives we could and have, at our highest and truest and noblest.
The assholes haven't just taken our incomes, our savings, our careers, our educations. They've taken something far more precious; something priceless. It is our lives - the full, true lives we should be living - that have been taken from us. And in the gaping void where the lives we should be living are, the assholes have deftly inserted carbon copies of ... themselves.
When you think about it that way ... is it any wonder that society seems to be stuck? That the economy seems headed into oblivion? That life for so pretty much anyone under the age of 35 and/or worth less than $20 million or so appears to be going ... nowhere?
Remember my friend Mara? She's probably being piloted like a drone ... yelled at by a bot ... three times a minute ... into waging advanced techniques of psycho-war ... designed to traumatize prisoners ... over and over and over again ... right this very second ...
Until she's cleansed. Perfect. Flawless. Pure. Another gleaming, brand-new asshole, rolling proudly off the assembly line of the Asshole Factory.
We're obedient constructivists. Pragmatists. Rationalists. So you probably want to know: what can we do about it?
It's pretty simple.
Don't be an asshole. Remember the Asshole Factories? Here's a secret: they're churning out assholes by the millions. And so should you bravely decide to be an asshole, what you'll really be is just another interchangeable, forgettable, rapidly depreciating commodity.
So who should you be?
Be yourself. The person you were meant to be. Whether you believe in heaven or the inferno, freedom or fate, the simple fact is: each and every one of us was put here to be something greater than Just Another Asshole stealing pennies from his neighbors to pay off Even Bigger Assholes.
So let me say it again. Don't be an asshole. Be yourself. The miracle of being that you were meant to be. A person that, consumed with passion, seared with happiness, aglow with meaning, brings forth all that is great, noble, and true in the world, and so, with love, mercy, and wisdom, lifts every life that you meet into the light.
Thank you and goodbye."

"*sigh*  As an old spook watcher and ComSec fan, this article indicates to me that some kind of shakeup in Russian collection inside the U.S. may have happened.  But that is all.  The authors of this article present as ignorant fools with no background knowledge or competency of any kind in intelligence studies and related technical basics.  They simply repeat whatever Big Lie propaganda our spooks feed them, because that's what their publisher pays them to do. Note the irrelevant and unrelated "Russian Meddling" propaganda narrative referenced again and again in the article...
Even if the 'new' information presented is all factual, we learn nothing new at all.  Wikileaks co-founder John Young quotes Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, former head of counterintelligence at the Department of Energy and a former CIA officer who first served in Moscow in the 1980s: "The Russians do everything in the U.S. that we did in Moscow."

Yes. I also know how to make a piece of charcoal, OR sintered graphite wrapped in wood pulp, painted yellow, with a little metal band and a pice of rubber on top.
Why do you think a boss has to provide tools, materials, OR directions? Most bosses have ZERO idea how the technology behind their business works, or do... sell out.... and let the money-sucking leeches take over.
For instance Seagate's founder Al Shugart was one of the people who figured out how to make a hard disk drive... Later, the engineers at Seagate were literally incompetent and they ended up calling in the people who were, in the beginning, hobbyists who found something they could make some money from, to figure out how to make some badly designed drive work. The same is true industry-wide. The boss's, AND Managment's  job is to figure out how to skim from MY KNOWLEDGE of how to make the pencil, and rip off my labor. In Seagate's case they simply stopped designing drives and bought other people's designs, from small shops, where the people still had some love for what they were doing, and the 'boss' had a tangible part in the process of making that disk drive.
Ps. Adam Smith didn't know shit about pins, either.
But he DID know the boss was useless scum.

"A lot of delusional, unpatriotic democracy haters like to argue that the US military doesn’t actually defend the freedom of the American people, and that it isn’t really used to defend freedom at all, and that it isn’t even really used to defend any rules-based international order as sometimes claimed, and that even to use the word “defend” to describe anything the US military does is inaccurate since it is consistently on the attacking and aggressing side of any given conflict, and that actually the US military functions as nothing other than a blunt object wielded by the rich and powerful for the advancement of plutocratic interests and the geostrategic dominance of opaque and unaccountable government agencies, and that it can in fact be accurately said that the only difference between the US military and any other band of armed thugs is funding…
I forget where I was going with this.
Ah, yes. Defending your freedoms. If sending a platoon of Paul Blarts to act as mall security for foreign oil corporations isn’t enough to get you saluting every American flag flying over every McDonald’s you see, then you should know that the US military’s freedom fighting doesn’t end at mere corporate asset protection.
They’re also defending your freedom by killing Afghan farmers in their sleep.
Why did the armed forces of the United States kill dozens of civilian farmers in Afghanistan while they rested in the field after a hard day’s work? That’s a good question. But an even better question is, what were those Afghan farmers doing lying on top of your freedom?
Obviously the compassionate US military would never dream of killing non-combatants under any circumstances whatsoever, but the unfortunate fact of the matter is that you can’t make an omelet without cracking a few civilians."

"The appearance of a new strain of coronavirus in the Chinese city of
Wuhan last month, which has since spread to more than 20 countries, has
sparked social media-driven panic around the world. People are scouring
the Internet for information about this coronavirus outbreak, which the
World Health Organization has declared a global health emergency, and
they are being bombarded with information dealing with both the reasons
why it appeared, and whether or not it could spread to become a global
The deadly novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is currently thought to have
originated in wild animals like bats, but this theory has yet to be
scientifically proven.
The American Project Syndicate media organization has published dogmatic
and undisguised anti-Chinese propaganda, without going into any detail
on the medical side of the problem, claiming that the affliction of
Chinese autocracy is responsible for the coronavirus epidemic.
An article available on the online Turkish news portal OdaTV states that
“the epidemic in China can be interpreted as a biological attack,”
stressing that China’s coronavirus outbreak is directly related to
America’s geopolitical interests, a country which has long been using
indirect strategies in its war with rival China. The piece provides
points to support this argument, noting that Washington is trying to
reign in China’s growth, prevent the country from implementing its One
Belt One Road initiative, and lower Chinese economic output. The United
States is using its naval fleet and allies to surround China in the
Pacific, preventing China from circumventing the Strait of Malacca,
fomenting unrest, blocking China from accessing Eurasia over land
through East Turkestan, and using sanctions and trade wars to try and
undermine China’s production and economy And although it is currently
hard to say for sure whether the virus originated naturally or
artificially, whether it was used as a biological weapon as part of the
bigger war between China and the US, one thing is clear, which is that
the coronavirus epidemic that has broken out in China will have a
profound effect on the country, and it will naturally affect Chinese
manufacturing, trade, the economy, and Chinese priorities, which the
United States will clearly benefit from.
A similar position is taken in the Norwegian news outlet Steigan,
suggesting that we reflect on the fact that the United States is now
feeling very intimidated by China’s rapid growth, is already waging a
trade war against China, and it is not too far-fetched that certain
American politicians could well have resorted to biological warfare. The
publication makes another point to back up the argument that this is a
possibility, reminding people the United States is already working on a
number of military plans to ensure US world domination. Of particular
note is the US plan to hack Russia’s power grid and shut down power
plants, which The New York Times wrote about in 2019, and the US are
intensifying their cyberattacks. The American strategy which has been
implemented since 2012 has entered an offensive phase, with the
aggressive introduction of potentially crippling malware, and at a depth
hat has never been tried before. Even if you do not believe that the
coronavirus was created intentionally, the fact that it would have been
possible should be enough to set alarm bells ringing for many.
Indian researchers have cast doubt over whether the new coronavirus
could have a natural origin, and have questioned segments of its RNA, as
they are unlike those of other coronaviruses such as SARS, and instead
appear to be closer to those of HIV. The scientists found that the
spikes which form the “crown” of the virus in short regions of proteins
are genetic inserts which bear resemblance to pieces of the human
immunodeficiency virus, HIV-1. The researchers pointed out that these
kinds of inserts are not found in other coronaviruses. In other words,
if the virus had mutated in a natural way, it would not have been able
to receive insertions from the immunodeficiency virus.
Oddly enough, it should also be noted that the novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV) is similar to other coronaviruses, such as Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which was first discovered in Saudi Arabia
(2012) and subsequently spread to other countries in the Middle East and
sub-Saharan Africa. The new coronavirus also shares similarities with
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which was first discovered in
China in 2002 and spread to countries all over the world, but SARS was
quickly brought under control and contained, and there were no more
cases of contraction recorded after 2004. MERS and SARS are both
coronaviruses. There are suspicions that these viruses were created in
laboratories, tested on animals, and they could only have been
transmitted to people through human intervention. The viruses were then
bioengineered to make it possible for them to be spread from human to
human. Both SARS and the new 2019-nCoV virus also have a feature which
ethnic Han Chinese are more susceptible to.
Considering this information, it is not surprising that a number of
media outlets in different countries have begun exploring the link
between the outbreak of the new 2019-nCoV virus in the Chinese city of
Wuhan and activities sponsored by the CIA and the Pentagon at over a
hundred secret and obscure biological laboratories engaged in the
manufacturing and testing of biological warfare agents. A few years ago,
one of these laboratories registered in Ukraine was uncovered, which was
working on a virus that ethnic Russians would be susceptible to. Since
there is no one “Russian race” and Russia is a multiethnic state, it is
reported that the initial trials failed.
However, these suspicions that the CIA or the Pentagon could possibly
have secretly planned to use the new 2019-nCoV virus as a biological
weapon did not just appear out of nowhere. Let’s not forget the secret
Operation Big Itch, which the CIA tried to implement in 1954. Back then,
they carried out the biological weapons tests at a remote US Army
facility in the Utah desert. Their goal was to determine whether it
would be possible to use tropical rat fleas (Xenopsyllacheopis, a
species discovered in Egypt in 1901 and named after Pharaoh Cheops) in
biological warfare as a disease vector. The fleas were carriers of
plague bacteria, and the “researchers” wanted to determine how the they
could be used for mass infection. Two sub-munitions of biological
cluster bombs were even developed simultaneously: the E14 bomb designed
to hold 100,000 insects, and the E23 bomb for twice the massive amount.
As for bats, and whether they could have been used in secret bioweapon
programs, as Bulgarian sources note, we should not forget that bats are
a source of Ebola, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and other
deadly diseases. The US Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) which
funds the America’s secret biolabs is conducting a number of studies on
pathogens of military importance in bats as part of biological weapons
research in its Cooperative Biological Engagement Program (CBEP), and
there are also projects for ethnicity-targeted biological weapons
(biogenetic weapons), which primarily attack specific ethnic groups or
genotypes. Although there has never been any official public
confirmation that these weapons are being developed, documents show that
the United States has long been collecting biological material from
certain ethnic groups, particularly from ethnic Russians and Chinese.
For instance, the US Air Force has been specifically collecting Russian
RNA and synovial tissue samples for a federal project, which is even
published on the US Federal Contractor Registration.

You're talking about the FLU. The number of cases is already on the

War tool.] and reported the rapid decline.
Some Economic and Political Factors of Coronavirus Outbreak
It is also worth noting that the global threat, posed by 2019-nCOV,
appeared around the same time when it became apparent that there was a
solid chance the trade conflict between two of the largest economies in
the world (with the potential to turn into a full-scale war with
world-wide repercussions) could be resolved.
It is important, however, to point out that we are referring here to the
prospect (not certainty). After all, the agreement between the United
States and China, signed on January 15, 2020 offers an opportunity to
gradually work out issues but does not guarantee that this process will
be successful. And yet, this document has already made a substantial
contribution to stabilizing the global economy.
However, this positive outlook may now be overshadowed by the latest
threat stemming from the panic caused by the news of the “2019-nCOV”
And its effect on the political situation in the world does not appear
to be too far-reaching for now. If we choose not to concern ourselves
with relatively “insignificant” matters, such as propaganda attacks
against China in light of the “new” threat emanating from it (whose
assessment, from Beijing’s perspective, is very biased, and does not
correspond to that of WHO ), and embarrassing comments fueled by racism
published by Western media outlets, we will realize that the main effect
of the start and spread of the epidemic has been the exacerbation of the
Taiwan Issue yet again.

Coronavirus - Statistical Change Causes Confusion - New Case Count
Continues To Decline
The Chinese government has added a new category of infections to the
total number of COVID-19 cases. So far there were two published
categories. 'Suspected cases', which were people who may have come in
contact with the virus and showed flu symptoms, and 'confirmed cases' of
patients who fell ill and where the virus was found during tests.
Now people who show signs of pneumonia will be added to the confirmed
COVID-19 cases even when the tests do not find the nCov19 virus in their
body. The same criteria will retroactively apply to the number of dead.
People who died while showing signs of pneumonia are now counted as
COVID-19 casualties even when their virus tests were negative.
The new method only applies to Hubei Province which has by far the most
of all global cases. The move added the 13,332 cases to the total number
of cases. (To keep the trend numbers comparable the new addition is not
incorporated in the above graphic.)
The change was not well communicated and has caused some serious
confusion. Some sources seem to believe that this increases the number
of total cases while other sources say that it simply moves people from
the 'suspected cases' category into a new sub category that runs under
'confirmed cases'.
The motive for doing this is not clear. The case numbers will now
include everyone who show signs of pneumonia but does not test positive
for the nCoV19 virus. The new count will thereby include a lot of people
who simply have a common flu.

"How to name a coronavirus
As regular readers of this column know, we usually object to labels,
because their meanings are often in the eye of the beholder rather than
Exceptions should be made, though. The current epidemic sweeping China
and threatening the world should be called by its label.
Most news reports call it “the coronavirus,” “a coronavirus,” “new
coronavirus,” or “novel coronavirus.” To be accurate, though, it must be
“a coronavirus,” “a new coronavirus,” or “a novel coronavirus.” That’s
because this coronavirus is separate from other coronaviruses that have
caused their own epidemics or pandemics. Each gets a name, and each was
new (or novel) at some point.
One of them, SARS, appeared in November 2002, in Guangdong province in
southern China. (SARS stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome.) The
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Site says that 8,098 people
were infected, and 774 died before it was declared under control in July
2003. It spread to 24 countries.
Another “coronavirus” is MERS, which stands for Middle East Respiratory
Syndrome, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. The World Health
Organization says 2,494 cases were reported, with 858 deaths, in 27
The current “coronavirus” first appeared in Wuhan, China, probably
transmitted to a human by an animal, and has spread to many countries,
including the United States, causing quarantines, panic, a run on
facemasks, and discrimination against Chinese people.
After several weeks without a name of its own, the current coronavirus
finally got one: The virus is SARS-CoV-2, and the disease it causes is
called COVID-19, after coronavirus and its year of discovery. “COVID-19”
does not run as easily off the tongue as SARS or MERS but there is a
logic to its name.
As the director general of the WHO, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,
said: “We had to find a name that did not refer to a geographical
location, an animal, an individual or group of people, and which is also
pronounceable and related to the disease. Having a name matters to
prevent the use of other names that can be inaccurate or stigmatizing.
It also gives us a standard format to use for any future coronavirus
outbreaks.” As Shakespeare did not say: what’s in a name can be important.
In getting a name without a geographic or animal identification,
COVID-19 can avoid some of the problems previous viruses have. This
year, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has
named several varieties of flu viruses, including an
A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 A(H3N2)-like virus, an A/Kansas/14/2017
(H3N2)-like virus, a B/Victoria virus, and a B/Yamagata virus. They get
shortened, to Singapore, Kansas, Victoria, and Yamagata, to make them
easier to say and understand. That stigmatizes the people in Singapore,
Kansas, Victoria, and Yamagata, who did not cause those flus. And of
course, there’s “swine flu,” “Asian flu,” “bird flu” and others.
Associating a disease with a place or an animal always risks
retaliation, and overreaction. It will be difficult enough to distance
COVID-19 from its Chinese source, especially as people shun Chinatowns
around the U.S. from an unfounded fear of COVID-19.
COVID-19 has already surpassed the death tolls of SARS and MERS, over
2,000 people as this is written, with little signs of abating. Still,
that pales in comparison with the CDC estimates of 26 million illnesses
from flu, resulting in 250,000 hospitalizations and 14,000 deaths from
flu in the United States alone.
And even the WHO director-general seemed frustrated that so much
attention was being paid to COVID-19. He began his Feb.11 briefing on
the coronavirus with a reminder: “Although the world is now focused on
coronavirus, we cannot and must not forget Ebola,” which has surged in
Africa and which has a much higher fatality rate than COVID-19.
So why is so much attention being paid to COVID-19? First, because it’s
new, and spreading. But as Max Fisher wrote in the New York Times,
COVID-19 “hits nearly every cognitive trigger we have.” Its novelty and
the uncertainty around it override the recognition that other diseases,
including flu, are far more endemic and dangerous. He likens the
reaction to that after a plane crash, when people shun flying even
though a crash is an anomaly and flying is overwhelmingly safe.
And social media spreads the rumors, fake cures, and other untruths that

COVID-19 and its effects, be they economic, physical, or social. But
acknowledge its place in the pantheon of disease. Reporting as if it
were the end of the world is an epidemic of a different kind.

And you see? I'm not one bit nicer on Farcebook.
Ps. The US also attacked Iraqi troops yesterday. Pentagon-Gone-Wild
enabled by someone obviously unfit to carry out the duties of the office
of US president. I read multiple National Security postings from
Brookings and elsewhere and they all agree that there is no actual legal
protection for what occurred in US law OR the 2001/2002 AUMFs, which
Brookings made very clear...
Let me quote:
against Iran. While some in the Trump administration, including
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have made arguments attempting to link
Iran and al-Qaeda — in what may be an effort to lay the groundwork for
invoking the 2001 AUMF, which was passed in the aftermath of the 9/11
attacks, as authorization to use force against Iran — that argument is
thoroughly unconvincing.
The 2001 AUMF authorizes the president to use:
organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed,
or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or
harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future
acts of international terrorism against the United States by such
nations, organizations or persons.”
This has long been understood to refer to al-Qaeda and the Taliban, who
harbored al-Qaeda in Afghanistan at the time of the 9/11 attacks, and
also has been interpreted by all three branches of government to apply
to “associated forces” of those two armed groups based on the principle
of co-belligerency in armed conflict.
As we have previously written: “The 2001 AUMF does not authorize the use
of force against Iran. Iran was not implicated in the 9/11 attacks,
Iranian forces are not al Qaeda or the Taliban, or their associated
forces, nor are they a ‘successor’ to any of those forces.”
Many have suggested that Pompeo and other officials may be laying the
groundwork for an argument that the 2001 AUMF authorizes military
operations against Iran because Iran is “harboring” some members of
al-Qaeda. As a factual matter, we are not aware of any credible
information that Iran is “harboring” al-Qaeda as a group, or allowing
al-Qaeda to plot attacks from Iran. As a legal matter, the AUMF has
never been construed to authorize military attacks against a foreign
nation based on the fact that some al Qaeda members may be located in or
transit that country, even if that is the case with Iran. In addition,
the AUMF’s use of the past tense — “harbored” — suggests that it was
intended to refer to those who were responsible for providing safe haven
for, and otherwise assisting, those who attacked the United States on
Sept. 11, 2001. In the 20 years since the 9/11 attacks, there has not
been any suggestion that the 2001 AUMF could be interpreted to authorize
force against a present-day “harborer.” (Again, there is no known
evidence to suggest that is what Iran is doing with al-Qaeda.)
The 2001 AUMF authorizes force only if it is consistent with
international law, as the Supreme Court explained in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld.
Even if the 2001 AUMF were somehow thought to apply to Iran — which it
does not — the executive branch would be able to use force against Iran
only if necessary and proportionate to the specific threat from al-Qaeda.
In a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing on June 19, Rep. Deutch
(D-Fl.) asked State Department Special Representative for Iran, Brian
Hook, whether he believes “the administration could launch an attack
against Iran under the 2001 AUMF?” His response, “this is something
which the office of the Legal Adviser can give you an opinion on, if
you’d like to submit it,” provides an appropriate next step for Congress
to engage with the administration on this issue.
Finally, it bears noting that there is no viable argument that another
AUMF still on the books — the “Authorization for Use of Military Force
Against Iraq Resolution of 2002” (2002 AUMF) — authorizes force against
Iran. It allows the president to use force that is “necessary and
appropriate” to “defend the national security of the United States
against the continuing threat posed by Iraq;” and “enforce all relevant
United Nations Security Council resolutions against Iraq.” Those are
plainly not relevant to the situation with Iran today."

Not really. They're really REALLY busy figuring out when the next
"lockerbie" is going to happen.
"There is a historic example of how Iran reacts to such U.S. provocations.
The U.S. attack:
    Iran Air Flight 655 was a scheduled passenger flight from Tehran to
Dubai via Bandar Abbas, that was shot down on 3 July 1988 by an SM-2MR
surface-to-air missile fired from USS Vincennes, a guided missile
cruiser of the United States Navy. The aircraft, an Airbus A300, was
destroyed and all 290 people on board, including 66 children, were killed.
The Iranian retribution:
    Pan Am Flight 103 was a regularly scheduled Pan Am transatlantic
flight from Frankfurt to Detroit via London and New York. On 21 December
1988, N739PA, the aircraft operating the transatlantic leg of the route
was destroyed by a bomb, killing all 243 passengers and 16 crew in what
became known as the Lockerbie bombing.
The Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corp (IRGC) claimed to be
responsible for the bombing of the plane. It had used a Palestinian
cutout in Lebanon to plant the bomb. But for political reasons the
official investigation was manipulated and the blame for the Lockerbie
bombing was put on Libya's leader Muammar Gaddafi who had absolutely
nothing to do with it.
The murder of the passengers and crew of Iran Air Flight 655 and the
retribution for it were five and a half month apart. This gives us a
hint of how long it might take for Iran to prepare the retribution for
the U.S. assassination of Major General Qassem Soleimani. There is also
the political calender that has to be considered. If an Iranian revenge
act is of a kind that could help Trump to get reelected it must wait
until after the U.S. election. If the revenge act is of a kind that
could hurt Trump's poll numbers it must come during the last few months
of the campaign.
We will know that it has happened when this flag comes down:
(Image: Red Flag Unfurled Over The Holy Dome Of Jamkarān Mosque, Qom

About 'listening to experts'. Speigel's article on the Soleimani hit
mentioned this is what happens when you run a government without
experts. Not that experts would have accomplished anything besides
slowing down an inevitability until such a time as they considered an
action against Iran 'winnable'.
Just Security (Brookings) claims there is no such US law or ANY AUMF
that would have allowed for this hit. They made that VERY clear. They
also claim that 'preemption' of an alleged attack isn't legit.
In excruciating detail...
Trump gave the Pentagon a long illegal leash and they just made
themselves war criminals without protection of even US law.
Pepe Escobar on FB a few hours ago sums up the gravity of the situation;
"THE AMERICANS KNEW SOLEIMANI CAME TO BAGHDAD AS A DIPLOMAT - AND THEY
KILLED HIM ANYWAY
Reconfirmed with Iraqi intel sources: the US military command at Baghdad
airport was OFFICIALLY informed that Soleimani would arrive in Baghdad
AS A DIPLOMAT, to advise the command of the Iraqi armed forces.
So the Americans killed a diplomat on an official mission.
This not only reiterates what we all knew about Exceptionalist
Cowardice. It points to the fact that now it's really the law of the
jungle. ANYONE is free to snuff out a diplo-Yankee anywhere.
Blowback WILL be a bitch."
As far as outcomes. The shooting down of an Iranian airliner resulted in
a Pan Am flight blown out of the sky over lockerbie (which was falsely
blamed on Gadaffi), so by extension the killing of Soleimani will result
in the endangerment of any US soldier or diplomat on Earth no matter
their stationing or appointment.
Pepe Escobar also says there's a Red battle flag flying over the main
mosque in Tehran, and you'll know revenge happened when the flag comes down
I'd say Trump and the Pentagon officials who ok-ed the operation
committed treason by illegally endangering Americans.

"'Business as usual': Selective Service System clarifies draft process
amid escalation in Iran tensions
The Selective Service System, which maintains a list of potential
recruits in the event of a military draft, clarified the process in a
Friday Twitter post following increased tensions between the United
States and Iran.
The killing of top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in a Thursday
airstrike ordered by President Donald Trump sparked concerns about a
broader military conflict with Iran and what appeared to be online fears
about the return of the draft.
"The Selective Service System is conducting business as usual. In the
event that a national emergency necessitates a draft, Congress and the
President would need to pass official legislation to authorize a draft,"
the Selective Service System wrote.
The Service later wrote that its website was experiencing "high traffic
volumes" that disrupted website functions because of "the spread of
misinformation." The Service, however, did not specify what the
misinformation was or what exactly caused the website crash.
The Service's website was still down Saturday morning.
The killing of Soleimani was the latest action in long-simmering
tensions between the United States and Iran, including the United
States' withdrawal from an accord limiting Iran's nuclear program and
the reimposing of sanctions on the country.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Friday morning on CNN that the
airstrike on Soleimani's convoy had come in response to an "imminent
attack." Iran has vowed "harsh retaliation" for those responsible for
Soleimani's killing, and the country's ambassador to the United Nations
said Saturday, "the response for a military action is military action."
The last draft ended after the Vietnam War as the U.S. military
transitioned to become an all-volunteer service. Currently, all male
U.S. residents between the ages of 18 and 25 must register with the
Selective Service, though registration with the Selective Service does
not necessarily mean all registrants will be drafted.
Women cannot be drafted as current legislation governing the Selective
Service only refers to "male persons," so the drafting of women would
require new legislation, the Selective Service says.
If troops are mobilized, "A lottery drawing would be conducted to
determine the order in which men would be called, and induction orders
would be issued, in lottery number order, by means of the U.S. Postal
Service," a Selective Service history explains."

I feel like I'm explaining how to take a shit to a child here.
I was recently ejected forcibly from a local courtroom by two rather
large and heavily armed bailiffs for 'illegally' taking a pic of a local
reporter taking a pic of court proceedings. I was told the local
reporter was 'authorized' (process unexplained) to take pictures and I
was not.
Ditto weapons in the courtroom. They OWN the courtroom and can arm
whomever the fuck they want.

The U.S. Army is warning about fake text messages saying people have
been selected for the military draft.
In a statement Tuesday, the Army said that several people around the
country have received texts saying they have been drafted or are
eligible for the draft. Some texts told the recipients to head to their
nearest Army branch “for immediate departure to Iran.”
The texts included both real and fake names of Army officials, and
warned of fines and jail time for a minimum of six years if there was no
Kelli Bland, director of Public Affairs for U.S. Army Recruiting
Command, told McClatchy News that their recruiters would not communicate
with anyone regarding a draft or registration in the Selective Service.
The Selective Service System, which is a separate agency from the
Department of Defense, manages registration for the draft. The draft has
not been in effect since 1973.
The Selective Service System said in a Facebook post Jan. 3 that it is
“conducting business as usual.”
“In the event that a national emergency necessitates a draft, Congress
and the President would need to pass official legislation to authorize a
draft,” the post said.
Bland said Army security personnel are looking into the origin of the texts.

@_subject: Instagram purging posts about assassinated Iranian 
Washington DC (CNN Business) Instagram and its parent company Facebook
are removing posts that voice support for slain Iranian commander Qassem
Soleimani to comply with US sanctions, a Facebook spokesperson said in a
statement to CNN Business Friday.
The Iranian government has called for nationwide legal action against
Instagram in protest, even creating a portal on a government website for
the app's users to submit examples of posts the company removed, Iranian
state media reported.
Instagram is one of the few western social media platforms that is not
blocked in Iran. Facebook and Twitter are blocked but some Iranians
access those sites using VPNs.
In a tweet, Iran's government spokesperson, Ali Rabiei, called
Instagram's actions "undemocratic."
Instagram shut down Soleimani's own account on the platform last April
after the US government designated the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
(IRGC) a foreign terrorist organization. Soleimani was an IRGC commander.
"We operate under US sanctions laws, including those related to the US
government's designation of the IRGC and its leadership," a Facebook
spokesperson said in a statement.
Iranian soccer player Alireza Jahanbakhsh, who has a verified Instagram
account, posted a photo of Soleimani after his death. Jahanbakhsh said
Instagram had removed that post.
Details of the takedowns were reported earlier by Coda Story.
As part of its compliance with US law, the Facebook spokesperson said
the company removes accounts run by or on behalf of sanctioned people
and organizations.
It also removes posts that commend the actions of sanctioned parties and
individuals and seek to help further their actions, the spokesperson
said, adding that Facebook has an appeals process if users feel their
posts were removed in error.
CNN Business has reached out to Twitter and Google for comment to ask
how they handle content related to people sanctioned by the US government.

Uncanny Valley: A Memoir by Anna Wiener. MCD, 288 pages.
At the end of October, I left an archetypal tech job at a secretive and
controversial big data analytics start-up, with whom I signed an NDA
more binding than my marriage vows. Sixteen months prior, the company
had divined my profile out of the algorithmic ether of LinkedIn, during
a period in my life when the sight of my student loan repayment date
would send me into days-long cycles of incapacitating self-pity. This
was also, incidentally, a time when I had finally begun to do the kind
of writing I found meaningful and interesting. But the work, like my
debt repayments, felt slow, hard, and uncertain; it required patience
and faith in the long game, two qualities which I’d never needed to
cultivate before. I was growing restless; I was getting bored. I felt
far from the action. I wanted my life—as Anna Wiener writes in her
incisive new memoir Uncanny Valley—to “pick up momentum, go faster.”
When the tech world rang the bell, my subconscious—hungry, ambitious,
curious—answered. It was the equivalent of setting down a long book to
pick up your phone when its screen flashes white, then forgetting about
the book entirely. The salary was transformative: after five years of
Sisyphean payments which had barely covered interest, my student debt
vanished in nine months flat. Every aspect of my life was subsidized by
unseen venture capitalists, whose faith in my employer’s eventual
profitability resulted in a sugar-daddy generosity: my rent, my errands,
my meals, the spin classes I needed when those meals caused me to gain
fifteen pounds. On days when the work felt exhausting or demeaning, I’d
slip into a meeting room, check my bank balance, and feel a sense of
embarrassingly intense relief. On days when I found myself worrying over
“ethical grey areas,” the kitchen staff (always women, almost always
women of color, almost certainly the company’s most diverse team) would
roll through each floor with a three-tier dessert cart, proffering
petits fours or miniature Croques Monsieur or honey-drizzled figs:
parodic emblems of the Antoinette-ish wealth the Valley’s procession of
IPOs seemed to promise.
When I left, I left with conviction, a story for another time. In the
weeks after, I sat waiting for my dopamine levels to rise back to
normal, for my energy to stabilize, for my sense of clarity and purpose
to return. Instead, I found myself lethargic and listless, reaching for
something I couldn’t name. I didn’t miss the perks, and I didn’t really
miss the work itself. I did miss my co-workers, but we still lived in
the same city. I inevitably missed the paycheck, but I’d known what I
was giving up.
What I really missed—what I felt cut off from—was what I thought I had
successfully resisted. The startup, like most tech companies, like most
technology itself, had done an impeccable job of transplanting its
employees’ sense of purpose. Without realizing it, I had outsourced an
entire part of my brain. I thought I’d been detached and observant, an
anthropologist among true believers, but a small, central part of me had
believed too, and that part was now wandering the desert in a torn
startup T-shirt, meekly repeating phrases like “Solve the world’s
hardest problems” and “Execute the mission,” thirsty for purpose.
It was in this frame of mind that I picked up Uncanny Valley. Like many
millennials who’d watched tech transform from “a fun way to flirt with
your crush after school” to “an unregulated behemoth undermining
democracy and perpetuating global inequality,” I had devoured Anna
Wiener’s short story by the same title in n+1 more than three years
prior, feverishly sending the link to everyone I knew at the time.
Later, I’d send it to some of my tech coworkers over the internal
company chatroom, usually receiving a meek :thumbs-up: emoji in return.
    What I really missed—what I felt cut off from—was what I thought I
had successfully resisted.
Having lived in Silicon Valley for four years—as a student at what
Wiener describes, in her arms-length, no-names style as a “private
university in Palo Alto”—and having been tech-adjacent (then
tech-subsumed, then tech-sponsored) ever since, I longed for writing
that could effectively capture the unimaginative hedonism and
fundamental sociopathy of the current tech boom: its insistence on
alienating us from everything worth having, only to sell it back to us
stripped down and restructured according to the values (and, worse,
aesthetics) of ahistorical libertarian vampires, whose kink for giving
billions of dollars to unqualified frat boys with underdog complexes had
resulted in the disruption-beyond-recognition of subtlety and flirtation
and dining and travel and journalism and democracy and one of America’s
great counter-cultural cities, among other things I had loved
absentmindedly, as though they could be taken for granted, before I
realized how quickly they would be brought to their knees.
Wiener’s “lightly fictionalized” account in n+1 was what I had hungered
for: it was acerbic and funny and incredibly bleak. She zeroed in on the
dissociative feeling that tech elicits in its more conscientious
employees and users: the self-alienating way you can recognize that a
company or a product or an experience is ridiculous and even dangerous,
but still be partially seduced by it, still yield. Where other writing
about tech had fallen squarely on either side of the line of
hyper-dystopian cheesiness (Dave Eggers’s The Circle) or fawning myopia
(Alexandra Wolfe’s Valley of the Gods), Wiener’s writing cut like acid
and burned like liquor. I wanted to see the Valley doused.
The long-awaited book-length adaptation of that original story—no more
light fictionalization; it’s a memoir—delivers on the promise of its
first incarnation in almost every way. Inherently timely, it aims for
timelessness and achieves it. Its style is of a part with the dry,
affectless writing of the period that Wiener seeks to capture but goes
beyond the Sally Rooney-Tao Lin axis to deliver something sharper and
more complete. Uncanny Valley is a quest narrative for the “privileged
and downwardly mobile” millennial, a quest without a clear purpose.
Wiener, as she presents herself, has no real goals and is motivated by
the vague, Pavlovian cues of the upper-middle class: a desire for work
that offers a sense of purpose, the gloss of prestige, and the assurance
of monetary well-being, or as she puts it, work that is “intellectually
engaging . . . alongside smart, curious people.” She leaves a thankless,
underpaid literary job for an early-stage e-book startup in New York.
When she is gently let go after a trial period, her hunger for the
startup world is piqued, and she finds herself blown west into the gold
rush of the Valley.
That Wiener manages to make her passive observation of this easy
drifting so compulsively readable is a testament to both her skill as a
writer and the distinct absurdity of her subject matter. I tore through
Uncanny Valley, riveted by the wit and precision of Wiener’s
observations: employees “[flank] the CEO in a semicircle like children
at a progressive kindergarten”; Hacker News (unnamed but easily
identifiable) serves as “the raw male id of the industry, a Greek chorus
of the perpetually online”; a pair of unworn Allbirds, the dorky,
excessively comfortable woolen shoe beloved by Bay Area venture
capitalists (the brand again unnamed by Wiener), sit in her apartment as
“a monument to the end of sensuousness.” Discussing tech bros’ obsession
with the concept of “achieving flow”—a trance-like state of working,
usually coding—Wiener writes, “I loved that they used this terminology.
It sounded so menstrual.” Later, across a few masterful pages, she nails
the feeling of mindless, ephemeral internet surfing: “Just me and my id,
hanging out, clicking.” Whatever unseen surveillance cameras took in my
facial expressions while I was reading Uncanny Valley on public transit
will have found me squinting, laughing, manically underlining whole
paragraphs, and sighing loudly with equal parts weariness and recognition.
    Wiener, as she presents herself, has no real goals and is motivated
by the vague, Pavlovian cues of the upper-middle class.
It is clear, early on, that Uncanny Valley has no narrative arc but
time; still, I wanted to see where we would arrive. Blurbs and reviews
have compared Wiener’s writing to that of Joan Didion, in particular the
latter’s account of California in the 1960s, Slouching Towards
Bethlehem. But Didion’s depiction was one of plainly observed horror,
the journalist watching at a remove, notepad in hand. Wiener, on the
other hand, approaches her subject matter not as a detached journalist
but as a willing participant.
Perhaps a more apt comparison would be Christopher Isherwood’s
fictionalized account of Weimar Germany, Goodbye to Berlin. There is a
sense, in both books, that the narrators have detached in order to
process all they are seeing; a double-edged proximity which offers
clarity of vision at the cost of complicity in something ominous and
inevitable, arriving just beyond the book’s end. “Psychologists might
refer to this as dissociation; I considered it the sociological
approach,” Wiener writes toward the end of Uncanny Valley. In the
memorable closing scene from her n+1 story, which makes its way into the
book-length memoir, Wiener scans photographs and video from her former
employer’s over-the-top holiday party, looking for her face in the
crowd, even though she knows she hasn’t been part of the company for
over a year. Isherwood’s book ends with his narrator watching the faces
of people walking up and down the Kleiststrasse, observing that they
have “an air of curious familiarity, of striking resemblance to
something one remembers as normal and pleasant in the past—like a very
good photograph.”
When we read Isherwood, we have the benefit of hindsight; we know how
history plays out. Wiener’s task is trickier. We’re barely beyond the
moment her book seeks to immortalize. Perhaps this is why moments of
Uncanny Valley—whose title seems to allude to nothing within the text
itself, and instead to the feeling you get while reading it—can feel
irresolute, as though the author is walking a very fine line, taking
care not to offend the more powerful residents of the city she still
calls home. It’s clear that Wiener is canny enough to see behind the
curtain, but it can seem, at times, like she still wants to believe in
the Wizard.
Describing her work at a data analytics startup, Wiener writes of her
colleagues’ and bosses’ reaction to Snowden’s whistleblowing that:
    The sole moral quandary in our space that we acknowledged outright
was the question of whether or not to sell data to advertisers. This was
something we did not do, and we were righteous about it. We were just a
neutral platform, a conduit.
I kept returning to that last line as I worked my way through Uncanny
Valley for a first, then a second, then a third time. Each time, I felt
teased by Wiener’s occasional snark, wishing it cut deeper. For anyone
who misses Valleywag, there is some coy skewering of the industry
throughout, though it can feel, at times, like that skewering is being
done with the dull side of a sharp knife. The pared-back tone which
gives Wiener’s memoir its stylistic strength betrays a forgivable
weakness at the heart of her project: at times, Wiener seems too eager
to stick close to the line of neutrality, to present Uncanny Valley as a
conduit itself. In one memorable scene, she talks with an arrogant
amateur urbanist at a party, who reveals his plan to set up an
experimental, “blank-slate” city of shipping containers in developing
countries. “I wished I was drunker,” Wiener writes, “so that I could get
mean.” I also wished she had gotten drunker. I wished she had gotten
mean. Both in the moment and in retrospect, something holds her back.
Wiener’s tongue-biting tendency is clearest in the book’s final quarter.
Through a good-natured Twitter disagreement over whether or not books
should, like everything else in the Valley, be optimized for efficiency,
Wiener unexpectedly befriends a billionaire named Patrick—easily
identifiable as Patrick Collison, wunderkind CEO of Stripe—and the duo
strike up a friendship over a series of elaborate, overly-sensual meals.
Wiener is aware that she tolerates behavior from Patrick which she
wouldn’t tolerate in other friendships, with non-billionaire, non-CEOs.
“It was easy to interrogate everyone’s relationship to power but my
own,” she writes, but in her dynamic with Patrick, it doesn’t seem like
she’s attempting much by way of interrogation at all.
    At times, Wiener seems too eager to stick close to the line of
neutrality, to present Uncanny Valley as a conduit itself.
Early on, Wiener traces her “industry origin story” to her tendency to
“respond well to negging,” and this quality seems true of her
throughout: she writes from the vantage point of someone eager to be
liked, eager to take part—with the restraint of someone who feels lucky
to be there at all. Though Wiener acknowledges that the emotional labor
and “soft skills” she brings to the table are as valuable as her peers’
technical abilities, she also continues to call herself “useless,” and
perpetually grants engineers and barely legal CEOs undeserved authority.
When her boyfriend rightly tells her, “I think you’re underestimating
what you might have that they don’t,” she sweetly evades the compliment
(“You?”) and lets the point drop.
At so many moments, Wiener gets within a finger’s distance of speaking
truth to power and then—points us in another direction, or ends the
chapter, or describes a bread basket. Of course, speaking truth to power
isn’t her project; if it were, this would be a completely different
book. But there is something unnerving about a memoir that so
brilliantly captures the mood and neuroses of San Francisco in the 2010s
yet seems somehow still respectful, occasionally reverent. Even as
Wiener critiques the Valley, there is a part of her that is protective
of it, a part of her still in its thrall. The strongest ethical concerns
in Uncanny Valley are voiced not by Wiener but by her activist
ex-hookup, who seems to delight in mansplaining the moral quandaries of
Wiener’s job to her. Again, Wiener opts to be the conduit, marking down
his arguments without taking them on as her own. Toward the end of the
memoir, Wiener begins to contemplate the value of unionizing in tech,
but abruptly ends this line of inquiry when a colleague from a
disadvantaged background points out, “We are not vulnerable people.”
Fair enough, but the value of unionizing in tech is hardly to bargain
for more lavish snacks and fitness offerings. Again, Wiener swerves away
from the overtly political; here, it feels like a missed opportunity.
Any honest memoir of the 2010s in San Francisco is, in some sense, a
memoir of loss: the get-rich-quick manufacture of millionaires has come
at the cost of reckless destruction, the ripple effects of which were
felt nationwide during the 2016 election, where Wiener ends her tale.
But Uncanny Valley isn’t particularly elegiac: we are shown so little of
the world outside of tech, the one being lost. My favorite section of
Uncanny Valley is Wiener’s litany of beloved inefficiencies, a moving,
paragraph-long tribute to the world of touch and scent and appetite and
slowness, ending with “Warm laundry, radio, waiting for the bus,” that
is set in contrast to the Valley’s vision of a world where everything
“could be optimized, prioritized, monetized, and controlled.” Is it
greedy that I wanted more by way of a defense for the sensuous world?
Outside of her relationship, we are given so few glances of Wiener’s
pre- and sub-Valley life, her non-working personhood. It’s true that
while working at startups, your inner self is more or less transplanted
by your working self—your value add. But it can be hard, in Uncanny
Valley as in our day-to-day lives, to track what is being lost, cut out,
I’ve come to the view this as part of the project of the book itself: to
leave us unsettled by how its narrator, like all of us, remains somewhat
in the Valley’s mindset, if not its pocket. This entanglement is a
feature of the system that works, as she notes, precisely as designed.
In the end, for all the generosity she extends to those around her,
Wiener is unsparing with herself: “Certain unflattering truths: I had
felt unassailable behind the walls of power. Society was shifting, and I
felt safer inside the empire, inside the machine. It was preferable to
be on the side that did the watching than the side being watched.”
Wiener has written an indispensable chronicle of this era in tech, the
consequences of which we will all reckon with as the next decade
unfolds. Still, given the Valley’s unmatched ability to avoid any sense
of guilt as the world around it burns, there is no doubt in my mind that
while Uncanny Valley will be read widely and voraciously throughout the
empire, Wiener’s readers—techno-skeptics and technologists alike—will be
able to recognize themselves without feeling indicted.
But surely someone, somewhere, eventually, will need to feel indicted.
At some point, we’re going to need the sharp end of the knife."

"The claim that "we are now faced with the most virulent virus epidemic

"...Kafkaesque events and situations, bizarre or ludicrous, leaving the

"In the technocracy, nothing is any longer small or simple or readily
apparent to the non-technical man. Instead, the scale and intricacy of
all human activities—political, economic, cultural—transcends the
competence of the amateurish citizen and inexorably demands the
attention of specially trained experts.
Further, around this central core of experts who deal with large-scale
public necessities, there grows up a circle of subsidiary experts who,
attending on the general social prestige of technical skill in the
technocracy, assume authoritative influence over even the most seemingly
personal aspects of life: sexual behavior, child-rearing, mental health,
recreation, etc.
In the technocracy everything aspires to become purely technical, the
subject of professional attention. The technocracy is therefore the
regime of experts—or of those who can employ the experts.
Among its key institutions we find the "think-tank," in which is housed
a multi-billion-dollar brainstorming industry that seeks to anticipate
and integrate into the social planning quite simply everything on the
scene. Thus, even before the general public has become fully aware of
new developments, the technocracy has doped them out and laid its plans
for adopting or rejecting, promoting or disparaging. 3
Within such a society, the citizen, confronted by bewildering bigness
and complexity, finds it necessary to defer on all matters to those who
know better. Indeed, it would be a violation of reason to do
otherwise..." ~Theodore Roszak, Making of a Counterculture

@_subject: Haunted by Cybersects 
For the record I differ with the author about their statement the
"Children of God" was a "Christian sex cult", or related to the vastly
wealthy Congressional Prayer Breakfast-sponsoring "The Family".
    "Oddly enough, Heaven’s Gate—the cult that became infamous in the
1990s—funded itself through web design, via a front company called
Higher Source. Indeed, the web was an integral part of the cult, leading
cultural theorist Paul Virilio to deem it a “cybersect,” a religious
fringe movement marked by an extensive use of the internet to congregate
or proselytize. The Heaven’s Gate website, like the Space Jam website,
is a primo example of ’90s web-iana. It has the quintessential starry
background—a common feature of Geocities-era websites, but particularly
poignant when used on the page of a UFO death cult. A “RED ALERT” gif
zooms in and out above the proclamation “HALE-BOPP brings closure to:
Heaven’s Gate”—referring to the mass suicide committed by members in
order to (they believed) evacuate the earth and exit their “physical
vehicles” (bodies) by hitching a ride on a spaceship trailing behind the
passing comet Hale-Bopp, which made its closest approach to earth on
March 22, 1997. The Heaven’s Gate website is lovingly maintained
(including, as of 2016, the answering of email inquiries) by two
remaining members of the cult, who believe that those who traveled to
the “Next Level” (another plane of existence reminiscent of heaven) in
1997 will return to earth, offering passage to anyone who wants to join
    Taking a deep dive on the Heaven’s Gate website is difficult. During
the many times throughout the years that I’ve remembered its existence,
I could never muster up the courage to click through the links on the
home page. It was too surreal, too close to death; a more superstitious
person might say the website feels haunted, and probing it would be like
disturbing a graveyard. Part of me was irrationally worried that what I
would find inside there would make sense to me, that I would get sucked
into the world of Do and Ti (the monikers of Heaven’s Gate’s founders)
unironically. One thing, however, causes me, and others, to persevere
deeper into this dark corner of the web: the need to understand why
these people did what they did. Why would they commit mass suicide in
tracksuits and Nike Decades? One page, titled “Our Position Against
Suicide,” is particularly chilling; the last paragraph becomes a tool to
justify mass death: “The true meaning of ‘suicide’ is to turn against
the Next Level when it is being offered.”
    The Heaven’s Gate website led me to wonder about the web presence of
the other notorious cults that captured the public imagination in the
1990s. While some millenarian sects like the Branch Davidians lack a web
presence, two others—the infamous Christian sex cult Children of God
(now called The Family International or TFI) and Aum Shinrikyo, the
Japanese group responsible for the 1995 Tokyo sarin gas attacks—both
continue to exist (unlike Heaven’s Gate), albeit as reformed or
reorganized groups, and both continue to have web presences. All of
these websites are equally displaced in internet-time."

"There are FIVE variants of coronavirus. Only ONE showed up in China..."
and the deadliest variety seems to have landed in... wait for it... Iran.
Pepe Escobar:
"I had already referenced the crucial Global Times report - but this
brings it to a whole new level, incorporating Chinese, Japanese and
Taiwanese scientific analysis.
The killer paragraphs are these:
"The geographical location with the greatest diversity of virus strains
must be the original source because a single strain cannot emerge from
nothing. He demonstrated that only the US has all the five known strains
of the virus (while Wuhan and most of China have only one, as do Taiwan
and South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam, Singapore, and England, Belgium
and Germany), constituting a thesis that the haplotypes in other nations
may have originated in the US.
Korea and Taiwan have a different haplotype of the virus than China,
perhaps more infective but much less deadly, which would account for a
death rate only 1/3 that of China.
Neither Iran nor Italy were included in the above tests, but both
countries have now deciphered the locally prevalent genome and have
declared them of different varieties from those in China, which means
they did not originate in China but were of necessity introduced from
another source. It is worth noting that the variety in Italy has
approximately the same fatality rate as that of China, three times as
great as other nations, while the haplotype in Iran appears to be the
deadliest with a fatality rate of between 10% and 25%. (7) (8) (9)"
So to recap: there are FIVE variants of coronavirus. Only ONE showed up
in China - as well as in South Korea and Taiwan. Less deadly variant in
S. Korea than in China. Variants in Italy and Iran DID NOT originate in
China. Deadliest variant is in Iran.

@_subject: WhatsApp security flaw: 1000s of links to groups incl. 'Closed 
"A DW journalist recently discovered WhatsApp links that lead to closed
groups could be found with a simple Google search."
"WhatsApp links that lead to closed groups can be found with a simple
Google search — a major security flaw revealed by DW last week (link).
Following social media outrage, the links were removed from Google’s
search results.
Despite the removal, however, publicly-available internet archives are
still storing the information, as security researcher Lav Kumar has
found out. He gathered and organized over 60,000 unique links, which can
still be found on multiple websites.
Of the 1,000 randomly selected links DW tested, 427 were active chat
links. Even without actively joining a group, its title, description,
image and creator's phone number are available for all. However, upon
entering a group, it is possible to also see the phone numbers of up to
256 participants, as well as other information, and adding these numbers
to one's contacts can reveal their names in the app.
"We show all numbers in groups for people's safety that way they know
who will receive their messages," WhatsApp told DW in response.
Real-life danger
Using this information, DW gained access to a group described as
"Ministry of finance civil servants" in Indonesia, revealing the phone
numbers of all 14 members. Several other groups appeared to be official
support groups for the campaign of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
Among the 427 active links DW examined, there were groups described to
be for school classes, medical trainees, political campaigns,
businesses, pornography and sex workers. Some groups included members
with particularly sensitive identities, such as one chat with hundreds
of members clearly labeled as an LGBTQ+ group in a Latin American
country with high rates of homophobic murders.
In some cases, the group image looked like amateur pornography or had
titles such as "ex-wives leaked videos," raising questions of consent.
Also listed were potential terrorist groups and groups advertised as for
sharing footage of "extreme" sexual content, including rape. A small
number indicated that they were for child pornography.
WhatsApp told DW that the company has a zero-tolerance policy around
child sexual abuse and bans users immediately if they are found sharing
content that exploits or endangers children.
The platform also claims to ban approximately 250,000 accounts each
month suspected of sharing exploitative images of children and relies on
user reports and all unencrypted information to do so.
'Useful for terrorism chats'
In response to the revelations, some Twitter users pointed out that this
information could be used by authorities to track down illegal content
without WhatsApp offering an official "backdoor" to encrypted content.
"Of course there is a possibility that they left it open to search for
problem groups," Jake Moore, a cybersecurity specialist and former Head
of Digital Forensics at a British police force, told DW, "they aren’t
always too keen to help law enforcement, so might have found it
beneficial to offer it out to law enforcement and not openly mention it."
On whether law enforcement would use this proactively to identify crime,
Moore said: "Most police forces aren’t that proactive, [but] rather
reactive. However, I would imagine it would be useful for terrorism
chats, yet I doubt they use WhatsApp."
However, investigations into far-right terrorism in Germany show that
organizations have used Whatsapp to introduce members to each other.

"Here’s how to arm yourself for the health catastrophe caused by public
"First, you should recognize that media is overwhelmingly incentivized
to produce negative and alarmist headlines, without the accompanying
historical context and analytical expertise needed for the average
person to evaluate the severity of those headlines. This is especially
problematic for the new coronavirus, because Americans have
significantly poor health literacy relative to their knowledge of other
public policy issues. And while some news publications may be
responsible and balanced, most are operated on business models that
privilege sensationalism and deem positive news and positive trends to
be not newsworthy. Meanwhile, as several studies of the Ebola crisis
demonstrated, it’s best to stay off of social media unless you want to
be misinformed or terrified."

"In essence, then, we are dealing with a collective fear event. In our
prosperous, technically controlled and automated world, we are no longer
used to things being unpredictable. And so therefore we like to assume
the worst."
Opinion: We need to deal with our coronavirus panic
It's right to take precautions; the coronavirus is not to be trifled
with. Even without a vaccine, there's no need to panic. But we do so
anyway, says DW's Jens Thurau after covering the outbreak.
The taxi driver who drives me from our editorial office to the Robert
Koch Institute in Berlin has her own view on the number one topic in
She asks: "What happens if the newspapers write: 'Don't be afraid of the
pink elephant! Then people will say: 'Oh God, we have pink elephants here?'"
That is an accurate description of what Germany is currently
experiencing with the new virus from China. Business trips are being
canceled, including domestic ones. Bottles of disinfectant are suddenly
mounted on office walls.
People want to be tested even if they show no or only minor symptoms.
Trade fairs are being canceled, party conferences are on the brink. And
yet every morning the train is tortuously full as usual. And why
wouldn't it be? Should we really follow the advice of scientists and go
into closed quarantine?
Do we have to stockpile now?
No we don't. Although, the scientists are also right, strictly speaking:
If everyone would sit still where they are for two weeks the virus would
hardly stand a chance. But unlike in Italy, for example, the epidemic in
Germany is, as the experts tell us, still in the "containment" phase. In
other words, infected persons are isolated and treated, contact persons
are tracked down. A kindergarten or a school might be closed down, but
not the whole country.
So do we have to do our "hamster-shopping" now, as some have already
done here and there? When a whole society is gripped by fear, all good
manners fall by the wayside: Unfortunately, one must say, especially
German society. So people are hoarding protective face masks, even
though, the experts tell us, they are of no use, but are urgently needed
in hospitals and doctors' surgeries. Not only, it is obviously criminal
to steal masks and sell them at a marked-up price on the internet. But
it only works because people easily fall into hysteria and create the
illegal market in the first place.
At press conferences with Health Minister Jens Spahn or the experts from
the Robert Koch Institute, Germany's main public health authority,
questions are asked that actually only prove how stupid journalists can
be. Why is there still no vaccine, one asked, with accusatory undertone?
The virologist Christian Drosten, now known throughout Germany and a
regular guest on television, who is feverishly researching a corona
vaccine with his international colleagues, is forced to make an effort
to control himself with difficulty and repeat the same lines: The virus
is new, many things are still unknown, we are working on it, but there
is no faster way. His expression shows that he thinks the press
conference is wasting his time.
So we grope our way through the epidemic. The ITB international tourism
fair in Berlin is canceled, the Hannover industrial trade fair
postponed. But the Bundesliga is still playing in full stadiums. The
president of the Robert Koch Institute, Lothar Wieler, isn't really
getting through with his message that most new infections are now
happening within Germany, so people are hardly bringing the virus from
abroad anymore. This is good news because it means that there are
probably fewer contact people to find and the experts can concentrate on
fighting the virus at home.
A collective fear
In essence, then, we are dealing with a collective fear event. In our
prosperous, technically controlled and automated world, we are no longer
used to things being unpredictable. And so therefore we like to assume
the worst.
What we have been familiar with for a long time are the flu waves during
the cold season. Just for comparison, as of Friday, March 5: Since the
beginning of the year, over 100,000 people in Germany have fallen ill
with flu and around 200 have also died of it. Among them are many old,
already sick and weakened people. But this number does not make the
It is like flying: Experts and statisticians never tire of pointing out
that the airplane is the safest of all means of transportation. The risk
of dying in road traffic is much higher. But the images of horrible
plane crashes just keep on etching themselves onto our brains. The many
thousands of successful take-offs and landings, every day, just happen,
and aren't worth a headline.
'Chill out, Germany!'
On the whole, my impression is that doctors, nurses and scientists in
Germany are still managing the coronavirus well. Certainly, the health
system has weaknesses, the health authorities in the municipalities are
overstretched and short of staff. And globalization has its insane
sides, which has become apparent by how many drugs are produced in China
that we are now short of.
When I get really upset about little things at home, my kids like to
tell me: "Chill out, Dad!" Which really annoys me. But now I can say it
too: "Chill out, Germany!" Let's take the virus seriously, listen to the
experts, and keep our nerve. Don't forget to wash your hands, refrain
from shaking hands in greeting, and instead smile nicely. And let's not
assume the worst.

"On Thursday, the World Day Against Cyber Censorship, the

its Uncensored Library, embedded deep inside the computer game
Minecraft. The project makes information blocked in certain countries
available via the online universe.
Around the world, more than 145 million people meander through the
landscape of Minecraft's virtual blocks. Recognizing the game's reach,
RSF decided to create a channel for banned information.
Situated on its own island, within the Minecraft universe, the library
is a relatively massive structure for the game. The library is stocked
with articles banned in the countries where they were written. Articles
from journalists in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Russia, Mexico and Vietnam
represent the beginnings of a database that will be expanded, said
Kristin Bässe, who supervised the project for RSF. "It is designed to
have a real impact," she said. Those five nations were chosen for their

STILL WAITING FOR CLARIFICATION!
It IS NOT CLEAR whether she's been released because the Grand Jury has
finished it's term, just to be re-incarcerated when a new Grand Jury is
convened, or whether she's been completely relieved of the
court-demanded "responsibility" to reiterate her court martial testimony.
The latter is SERIOUSLY UNLIKELY until Julian Assange is exonerated.
After all, they released her after the last grand jury was termed out,
and then immediately put her back in a cell again because Double
Jeopardy doesn't apply. She not being charged with anything, She's being
held to coerce her to comply with a court order that she testify about
whether she gave Assange her wikileaks password.
She claims she already answered that during her court martial and the
government's demand she re-state her testimony is an attempt to entrap
her if her testimony varies by even a word, which IS how the feds manage
to imprison people they can't otherwise convict. By claiming you lied or
perjured if your testimony varies.
It's criminal, and it's common, and even if you look at the people
around presidents who end up convicted in federal courts it's rarely for
the original charges and typically for that bit of entrapment. They ask
you the same questions over and over. Show up at 12 midnight for another
interview, and literally harass you until you crack and attack them so
they can blow you away , or find some discrepancy and jail you for lying.

they did to an acquaintance of the Boston Marathon Bomber.

"In the likely event that you need some news to give you a bit of faith
in humanity today, you should know that supporters of whistleblower
Chelsea Manning have raised over a quarter million dollars to pay the
cruel, draconian fine that was heaped upon her for her principled stand
against testifying at corrupt secret grand jury proceedings.
In just two days after Manning was released from prison, more than six
thousand donors banded together to pay off the $258,000 fine assigned at
a thousand dollars a day by a federal judge on top of imprisonment to
coerce her to testify. Fundraising was so enthusiastic that it had
overshot the goal and reached $267,002 before the GoFundMe was closed.
Those of us who support Manning have been looking at this more as a fine
on us than on her, because of course we were never going to let a heroic
whistleblower spend the rest of her life under crushing debt. The fact
that the money came together so quickly and easily, though, says a lot
about the beauty of humans in my opinion."

They're using the initial mortality statistics of a FLU variant (without
trying to sound callous)  'at-risk die-off', and never following up with
the stats that show a huge drop off in deaths after-that-fact
illustrating this is really just another flu ... without a vaccine for
that at-risk cohort.
Tens of thousands of people died from the Flu and it's complications in
the US alone last year and there was no talk of Quarantine, or
comparisons to Ebola, Malaria and the Plague.
Personally I believe that fearmongering is INTENTIONALLY BEING DONE as a
form of:
A> Hybrid Economic War on China.... because tariffs and sanctions simply
don't work when the nation targeted makes or is a major part of the
supply chain for EVERYTHING YOU NEED on a daily basis, from clothes to
cars to food, and
B> It essentially enforces mandatory "Disaster Capitalism" globally, plus
C> The media simply ran out of "terrorists" to panic us about and
everyone's sort of bored with Trump's "Stupid Act" [See my Ps], and
since the media's owners got VERY USED TO making HUGE amounts of money
sensationalizing those things, they had to find something else...
That something else is "Be afraid of each other"
The rich are going to get richer beyond their wildest dreams and stand
as close together as they like... while the rest of us live in fear of
each other.

Ideology is dogmatic like a religion. As far as Anarchism, and Karl Marx; Marx visualized a withering away of the state. Anarcho-Communism, not the crap centralized totalitarian state the bulkshitviks handed the people of Russia.
Fidel Castro meditates, then says:
"These years have taught us all to meditate more and analyze better. We no longer accept any "self-evident" truths. "Self-evident" truths belong to bourgeois philosophy. A whole series of old cliches must be abolished.
Marxist literature itself, revolutionary poitical literature itself, should be renewed because repeating the same old cliches, phraseology and verbiage that have been repeated for 35 years wins over no one, convinces no one at all. There are times when political documents, called Marxist, give the impression that someone has gone to an archive and asked for a form: form 14, form 13, form 12; they are all alike, with the same empty words, in language incapable expressing real situations. Very often, these documents are divorced from real life. And then many people are told that this is Marxism. . .and in what way is this different from a catechism. and in what way is it different from a litany, from a rosary?...
...The communist movement developed a method, a style, and in some aspects, even took on the characteristics of a religion. And we sincerely believe that the character should be left behind. Of course, to some of these "illustrious revolutionary thinkers" we are only petit bourgeois adventurers without revolutionary maturity. We are lucky that the Revolution came before maturity! ~Major Fidel Castro Ruiz, Speech delivered at the closing of the First Conference of the Latin American Organization﻿ of Solidarity (OLAS), August 10, 1967﻿
