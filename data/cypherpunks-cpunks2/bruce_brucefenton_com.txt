@_subject: Call for Cypherpunks historians  
Hi all,
I'm working on a book about blockchain tech and one chapter covers some of the earlier discussions which originated from this list.
Anyone who'd be willing to be interviewed on 1) the earlier days of this list 2) thoughts on blockchain tech, Bitcoin and overlap between that tech and Cypherpunks -- your help would be appreciated Bruce Fenton
