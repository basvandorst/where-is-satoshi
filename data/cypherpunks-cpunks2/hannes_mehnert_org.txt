I'm a researcher with some experience in formal methods
( and also software development
( in different kinds of programming languages.
I actually question whether your criteria is extensive enough.
Especially from crypto systems and anonymity systems, I'd want to have
a proper specification of the protocol, either by writing it in a
logic system or by using a declarative programming language.
In my experience, code with lots of shared mutable data (such as
object-oriented and imperative programming) tends to produce usable
applications quickly, but once you want to go
multi-core/multi-threaded or extend at points not thought upfront, the
code becomes messy and really hard to maintain. Thus I'd go for some
functional programming language where you write most of the time code
which does not mutate the heap.
Another piece of thought is this static typing vs dynamic typing.
While the latter produces prototypes quickly, the former results in
much more confidence that the application will actually do the right
thing (again, static typing is not a replacement for testing).
Your fourth point can be mitigated by a) two compilers to
cross-bootstrap [ and/or b)
formalised and small runtimes.
At the time being I'd suggest to look into OCaml/Haskell/Erlang or
Idris (if you need a really expressive type system), maybe write
specifications upfront in Coq/HOL/Lem. I don't see any reason these
days to use C/C++ or another unsafe macro-assembly language (and
currently develop a TLS stack in pure OCaml to run with openmirage.org

Agreed. I use the Caml part of OCaml. :)
But if you have a chance to start from scratch, you should look at
possible solutions and use a viable one. Especially the readability
and maintainability of a programming language should be considered.
Otherwise you end up with a piece of code which is not maintainable
once the PhDs have graduated. You have to pay the technical debt at
some point. And I'm not sure how to hand over a research project to
'the open source community'... Are there best practices/guidelines
I think the OCaml community is rather larger compared to other
functional programming languages, and it is very helpful. Both the
real world ocaml book, available online and their package management system OPAM, are awesome contributions
over the last years to easily start with OCaml and to get more people

first of all I want to discuss 'verification'. There are so many
different definitions and it seems everybody uses their own
definition. It is strongly connected to trusted code base. Which
axioms of a rule system do you believe in? Do you believe that
arithmetic is verified? There are some axioms which you need to
trust... [
Some software 'verification systems' trust in more axioms than
others... and yes, there have been verification systems which accepted
invalid code/proved falsity.
The other topic is trusted code base:
 - verification system itself (it's just a piece of software)
 - compiler? [
 - language runtime?
 - operating system?
 - microcode of the processor?
 - hardware??
The difference, as far as I can tell is in-band vs out-of-band
signalling... (correct me if I'm wrong) with the former you put some
magic values before and after the array, and an attacker has to guess
these. The latter puts the meta-information out of band, hard to
predict for an attacker.. that's at least the difference between the
llvm bounds checks plugin (BoundsChecking.cpp / MemorySanitizer.cpp in
LLVM 3.3) and the softboundCETS approach..
[I've to admit that I did some research in Coq over the recent 3 years
(a higher-order separation logic to verify the full functional
correctness of Java programs). And no, at the moment I don't believe
anymore in taking off-the-shelf code and verify its correctness.
That's a myth. If we need to reimplement it anyways, why not in a neat
modern programming language?]
In Coq you can develop programs and extract them to ML code, without
the irrelevant proof bits. But it seems this is rather cumbersome. The
verified optimizing compiler for C, compcert
[ does this.
The softbound plugin [ although
they developed a semantics for the LLVM intermediate representation,
have the real implementation in C++ and no formalized proof (at least
I couldn't find any) of its correspondence to the Coq development. I
actually think there are some overflows in the C++ runtime (size +
start < bound might fail
The verified L4 microkernel redeveloped a bunch of C++ and assembly
into Haskell in order to be able to prove it.
The main difference between Coq and Agda/Idris is that the dependent
types are used in Coq to proof stuff, while in Agda/Idris you use them
for programming. (Obviously, all is the same, and Adam wrote a great
book about programming with dependent types in Coq
Agda has a story about people not interested in executing programs,
but rather type check and prove them.
Idris has a slightly different tradeoff -- instead of forcing
developers to write only total functions (due to curry-howard, partial
functions better not be used for proofs [basically if you use a
partial function for a proof, you assume false, and can prove
everything]), but also partial functions. Only total ones can be used
for proving though. Idris has a compiler which produces executable
programs! :)
Obviously the runtime needs to be looked into. In the end it is part
of your trusted code base.
Unfortunately I have not used ATS, but if I'm not entirely wrong, it
is a dependently typed programming language with mutable state and a C
foreign function interface which treats variables as resources (and
uses linear logic/linear types to do so). A very interesting system;
Chris Double wrote several blog posts when he used it

I'm happy to discuss further,
