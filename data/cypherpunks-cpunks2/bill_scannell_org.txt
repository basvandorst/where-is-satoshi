Hi all,
The First Workshop on Language-Theoretic Security (LangSec) at the IEEE CS Security & Privacy Workshops solicits contributions related to the growing area of language-theoretic security.  The workshop will be held on May 18, 2014.   For more information, visit:
 .
The overall goal of the workshop is to bring more clarity and focus to two complementary areas: (1) practical software assurance and (2) vulnerability analysis (identification, characterization, and exploit development). The LangSec community views these activities as related and highly structured engineering disciplines and seeks to provide a forum to explore and develop this relationship.
Looking forward to hearing from you,
