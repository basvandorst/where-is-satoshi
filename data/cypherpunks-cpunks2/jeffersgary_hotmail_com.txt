Alternative Physics - Tom Bearden's site
My fellow Cypherpunks,
   I've found a really interesting site based on alternative
 - Tom Bearden's site.
   The site also deals with free energy, zero point energy, scalars,
health physics, alternate physics weapons, and mind control physics.
   Some of Bearden's interesting pages:
THE FINAL SECRET OF FREE ENERGY
- It may or may not be necessary to replace "%" with blanks.
ANNOTATED GLOSSARY BY TOM BEARDEN (of physics)
Some teasing bait for physicists:
34 FLAWS IN CLASSICAL EM THEORY
A VISUAL TOUR OF WHAT THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW ABOUT ELECTRICAL
   If this site is true then "EVERYTHING YOU KNOW IS WRONG!" The
quote is from FireSign Theater - a comedy group.
Yours Truly,
Gary Jeffers
