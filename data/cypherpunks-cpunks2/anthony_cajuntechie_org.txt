Oh come on, really? Do you know /anything/ about the cypherpunk
movement? Have you read the older archives of this list? Have you even
read the /newer/ archives of this list?
In most cases, governments (not just the USG) are diametrically
opposed to /everything/ that cypherpunks stand for. The fact that
you're surprised that this list is anti-gov is kind of laughable.
Do a little more research.

Hash: SHA512
I've got a question about the FBI vs Apple case that I don't think has
been discussed before here (or at least I haven't seen it). It
pertains to reverse engineering and the FBI's seeming helplessness.
Software is software and we reverse engineer software all the time.
I'd assume that the government has some fairly competent programmers
on staff so why don't they just figure out what they need to change in
iOS that would allow them to disable the passcode entry count and just
I'd imagine that, somewhere in iOS code, there is a block of code
similar to
if(passwordEntryCount == 10){
    destroyPhoneAndKey();
Wouldn't this be trivial to spot in assembly code and get around it?
Isn't this really just a game the FBI is playing to make us think they
just can't get around Apple's 'oh so clever' schemes?
Or am I missing something here?

There's value in running security software on a compromised system
because it helps to stop /mass/ surveillance. Ultimately, if you are
under surveillance, they're going to get you but they're going to have
to devote some time an effort /to you/. You're not going to get caught
up in the worldwide dragnet.
My personal quarrel with the NSA and other security services isn't that
they watch people at all. It's that innocent people are getting caught
in a dragnet and that information could be used against them later.
It's a hard AND expensive problem to address. There aren't a whole lot
of people with processor design skills that aren't already working in
processor design for one of the biggies. And the few that are likely
don't have the money to bring up what it takes to do it. It's not like
this is going to be bootstrapped by a Kickstarter.
It's making people more aware of what's going on and how to protect
themselves. Sure, it's not solving the problem but it is making things a
bit better. Perfect is the enemy of good. If the spooks don't go after
one person because it would take more personalized resources than simply
catching them in a dragnet, that security has worked. We don't need
'perfect'. We need 'good enough'.

Yes it does. Because before Snowden, they were basically capturing
data right off the wire in many cases. They were passive. It just
flowed right into their filters. Compromised hardware doesn't stop
them from getting your data in all cases, but it makes them work a
little more for it. They can't just sit on the wire and collect it
because they have to address the differences in each compromised
system. They have to seek you out instead of sucking it all in.
I don't have a problem with targeted surveillance For example, if the
police believe (with good reason) that someone is plotting to bomb the
Whitehouse, I believe they should absolutely have the right and the
tools to monitor that person. That surveillance should stop the moment
they either have enough to make an arrest or they realize they are
wrong. Do you believe that no surveillance should happen at all for
any reason? You believe that's reasonable?
I don't subscribe to that believe so please don't put words that I
didn't say or assume beliefs that I haven't expressed. People who are
caught in the surveillance dragnet /may/ be innocent of any crime or
they might not be. We really don't know, do we? I'm sure that some if
the information the agencies have gathered /do/ involve people who are
guilty of crimes and the data might prove it. Some, probably most,
don't. If the government has strong evidence that an individual has
committed a crime and evidence of it is being shared with others then
they should go through the legal channels and get authorization to
collect data on that single person. Not the entire neighborhood, not
the entire city. A single person.
Also, I don't subscribe to the bs about 'if you have nothing to hide,
you have nothing to fear'. Taking precautions to protect privacy
should never be taken as evidence of guilt. I'm not ashamed of my
naked body and there are times when I might even have no problem
walking in front of a window naked. But there are also times when I
want privacy and will draw my blinds. I don't hide the fact that I use
the bathroom but that won't stop me from closing the door when I go
in. In both of those cases, I'm not hiding anything. I'm exercising a
right to /privacy/. My privacy, when I am not committing a crime that
harms others, should /always/ be under my control.
Processor design isn't particularly difficult. Neither is algebra.
Something doesn't have to be /hard/ to not be /common/ and not be
specialized. Processor design is not difficult to those who have taken
an interest in it and chosen to learn how to do it. The number of
people who would do that and then not seek jobs in the industry is
negligible. Sure, there are some people who might do it out of
interest or even for fun, but do you believe that number is really
enough to start a company powerful enough to mass manufacture chips?
Oh, and what about the person actually 'assembling' the chip who might
know very little if anything about processor design? What about that
person being bribed to insert something they don't even understand
into the assembly process? Do you think that wouldn't happen? If Intel
made it a policy not to have anything secret in their microprocessors,
do you really believe the security agencies would just go "darn! There
goes our chance to compromise Intel chips!"
Also, what's stopping the agencies from actually starting up a front
company just to manufacture open chips and slipping something in?
Don't think it would happen because 'someone is watching' and the
whole 'shallow bugs with many eyes' thing? I present to you Heartbleed
and ShellShock.
Oh and, of course, having the perfect processor /design/ is useless
unless you have trusted fab which, of course, circles back to the low
level worker and a nice big deposit of Bitcoin.
OK, so I'll retract my statement above. Maybe this could be crowd
sourced. But again, how do we guarantee fab security? If a company has
to crowdfund a small number of chips, do you really think they are
going to have the money to set up fab operations that they can closely
audit and control?
No, you're very right that they didn't. New attacks are being
developed right now against vulnerabilities and backdoors we haven't
even discovered yet. And the attacks get better and better especially
when the companies collude with the government. It's not going to
magically get better through simply knowing about how bad it is. That
wasn't my point. But what can happen is larger and larger groups of
people (who control the money that places like Intel are rather fond
of) standing up and saying "we can't trust you so we're going
elsewhere". Critical mass is needed to make a difference not just a
few geeks ranting on Internet forums and mailing list. We don't have
the market moving power that a larger group does. That's why making
people aware and actually agitating the situation is so important.
No it doesn't. Good enough, in this case, means getting a bit of
breathing room for people while the geeks figure out how we back the
government off technically. Until they can't technically control every
single piece of hardware, at least make it as hard as possible for
them to control it. Sure, it's not solving the problem entirely but
you have to admit it's going to protect some people who would
otherwise get caught up in a dragnet. Their data isn't there anymore.
Don't get me wrong, I am 100% behind making hardware secure. But we
can't be so focused on absolute security with no compromise that we
absolute. That's kind of like "well, we think the NSA might be able to
break TLS by asking for our private key so we'll just keep using HTTP
until we develop a way where having our private key doesn't matter".
You do what you can and then you refine it closer and closer to

That /could/ be true. But why should we believe that they wouldn't
have enlisted the cooperation of Microsoft prior to the dates on the
Snowden leaks? The NSA has been cooperating with companies since the
1970's (and got in a lot of trouble about it). Why would they ignore a
company that has 90%+ of the desktop market worldwide? Possible but
unlikely IMHO.

You bring up good points. It not only saves money but also allows them
to hide their true capabilities.

That's not a given. Everyone believes that Windows has backdoors and
spying components in it but we've not seen a single Snowden from
Microsoft. Why would we from Apple, an even more secretive company

Hash: SHA512
Buried in the announcement of the new Kaby Lake (seventh-generation)
I'm a bit late to the party but I wonder what this means for Linux and
BSD? With 'deep integrations' between the silicon and Windows 10, it
sounds like a lot of the functions of the chips night not be available
to anything but Windows 10.
Have either AMD or Intel made any statements on this?

@_subject: Trustable, darknet based, cryptocurrency exchanges? 
For those of us in the US (and I assume many of the more invasive
European countries too), purchasing cryptocurrency anonymously is
getting increasingly difficult. Most US based exchanges requires at
least some ID verification and things like LocalBitcoins are generally
much more expensive to trade using.
Does anyone know of a trustable, no-questions asked, darknet based
crypto exchange?

A few days ago, I was thinking about ways to compromise even the most
secure systems and I came across a fairly obvious way: through operating
system updates. I admit that I am not up to date on the latest security
research so please excuse me if this has been discussed before or is
'common knowledge'.
What's stopping the FBI or other US law enforcement agency from
compelling a US based operating system vendor, let's say Red Hat, from
delivering a specialized update to a user that would allow the agency
privileged and maybe even undetectable access to a target system?  Since
Red Hat has root on our systems, they could install whatever they want
and most users wouldn't notice. For a company like Red Hat, it would be
trivial since they know who you are as you are tied to your Red Hat
subscription But this is by no means limited to them. Microsoft could do
this too with a little more work.
What are your thoughts? Am I crazy? Is this a 'well, we KNOW THAT
already' moment that I am just catching up on?

It's interesting though: in the film, you hear him say that there doesn't seem to be much dirt on Trump. Of course, that was years ago so that could have changed. I suspect there might not be a lot of backroom crap with Trump to disclose. He's a pretty public sleazebag.

Even though WikiLeaks have released the keys to the kingdom, I don't think it would matter for prosecution. Keep in mind that we have proof of all of the NSA stuff and yet, when a criminal defendant tried to use those as evidence in his case, he was told he couldn't because he could not proce that the tools were used specifically against him. I suspect any prosecution of Assange would likely follow a similar route. Anthony Papillion

16.05.2017, 05:03, "Georgi Guninski" :
Custom support might well be a big earner for Microsoft but I don't think it's the main reason they 'hoard' patches for older software. Users would stay on old, outdated, software forever if they weren't given a strong incentive to upgrade. Hell, I have customers still running shit on Windows 95 who refuse to upgrade because of costs or software availability. Not only that but making it comfortable for users to stay on old systems is cumulative: more and more users choose not to upgrade because they will continue to be supported and the support costs to Microsoft go up with every single release (bandwidth isn't free, engineering time isn't free). Again, it makes sense to try to make it uncomfortable for users to upgrade. So yeah, I totally understand making it as uncomfortable and costly to lag behind as possible from both a security and financial standpoint.
