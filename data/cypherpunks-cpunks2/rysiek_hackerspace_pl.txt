I am more interested in the protocol. People are already using RetroShare, right? It's FLOSS, it has some sort of a protocol underneath. So it is possible to create new implementations that do not make errors of the original *IF* (and that's a pretty big "if") the protocol is solid, of which I have no way to ascertain.

As it is the first DHT-based communication and filesharing application/system based on strong encryption that is actually usable -- at least from what I have seen.

PayPal's comment:
"Please provide an itemized budget and your development goal dates for your
 project"
MailPile team's comment:
"After going round and round on the phone with PayPal, I am left with the very
 strong feeling that this entrpreneurial freedom is in jeopardy. If PayPal has
 financial risks to mitigate, why is that specially true in our case? Are the
 risks larger because we are successful?"
inb4 "why would they use PayPal" -- from what I've heard they didn't plan it originally but it was brought in by popular demand.

Hi there,
so this has come to my attention. Whaddya guys and gals think?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
In his Q&A to his keynote address at the World Hosting Days Global 2014
conference in April, the world’s largest hosting and cloud event, Julian
Assange discussed encryption technology in the context of hosting
systems. He discussed the cypherpunk credo of how encryption can level
the playing field between powerful governments and people, and about 20
minutes into his address, he discussed how UNIX-like systems like Debian
(which he mentioned by name) are engineered by nation-states with
backdoors which are easily introduced as ‘bugs’, and how the Linux
system depends on thousands of packages and libraries that may be
I recommend watching his 36 minute Q&A in its entirety, keeping in mind
my recent warnings about how GNU/Linux is almost entirely engineered by
the government/military-affiliated Red Hat corporation.
The Voice of Russia website has an article on Assange’s address with a
few quotes:
    “To a degree this is a matter of national sovereignty. The news is
all flush with talk about how Russia has annexed the Crimea, but the
reality is, the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, principally the United
States, have annexed the whole world as a result of annexing the
computer systems and communications technology that is used to run the
modern world,” stated Julian Assange in his keynote address…
Don’t just read the short article, listen to the address yourself,
because Assange goes into many areas, and the work being done in these
Assange mentions how Debian famously botched the SSL random number
generator for years (which was clearly sabotaged – a known fact).
Speaking of botched security affecting Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo,
SuSE, *BSD, and more, the nightmarish OpenSSL recently botched SSL again
(very serious – updated comments on how a defense contractor in Finland
outed the NSA here?) It’s very hard to believe this wasn’t deliberate,
as botching the memory space of private keys is about as completely
incompetent as you can get, as this area is ultra-critical to the whole
system. As a result, many private keys, including of providers, were
potentially compromised, and much private info of service users. Be sure
to update your systems as this bug is now public knowledge. (For more on
how OpenSSL is a nightmare, and why this bug is one among many that will
never be found, listen to FreeBSD developer Poul-Heening Kamp’s
excellent talk at the FOSDEM BSD conference.)
From the start, my revelations on this blog about Red Hat’s deep control
of Linux, along with their large corporate/government connections,
hasn’t been just about spying, but about losing the distributed
engineering quality of Linux, with Red Hat centralizing control. Yet as
an ex-cypherpunk and crypto software developer, as soon as I started
using Linux years ago, I noted that all the major distributions used
watered-down encryption (to use stronger encryption in many areas, such
as AES-loop, you needed to compile your own kernel and go to great
lengths to manually bypass barriers they put in place to the use of
genuinely strong encryption). This told me then that those who
controlled distributions were deeply in the pockets of intelligence
networks. So it comes as no surprise to me that they jumped on board
systemd when told to, despite the mock choice publicized to users –
there was never any option.
A computer, and especially hosting services (which often run Linux), are
powerful communication and broadcasting systems into today’s world. If
you control and have unfettered access to such systems, you basically
control the world. As Assange notes in the talk, encryption is only as
strong as its endpoints. eg if you’re running a very secure protocol on
a system with a compromised OS, you’re owned.
As Assange observed:
    “The sharing of information, the communication of free peoples,
across history and across geography, is something that creates,
maintains, and disciplines laws [governments].”

@_subject: Assange: Debian is Owned by the NSA 
Hi there,
so this has come to my attention. Whaddya guys and gals think?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
In his Q&A to his keynote address at the World Hosting Days Global 2014
conference in April, the world’s largest hosting and cloud event, Julian
Assange discussed encryption technology in the context of hosting
systems. He discussed the cypherpunk credo of how encryption can level
the playing field between powerful governments and people, and about 20
minutes into his address, he discussed how UNIX-like systems like Debian
(which he mentioned by name) are engineered by nation-states with
backdoors which are easily introduced as ‘bugs’, and how the Linux
system depends on thousands of packages and libraries that may be
I recommend watching his 36 minute Q&A in its entirety, keeping in mind
my recent warnings about how GNU/Linux is almost entirely engineered by
the government/military-affiliated Red Hat corporation.
The Voice of Russia website has an article on Assange’s address with a
few quotes:
    “To a degree this is a matter of national sovereignty. The news is
all flush with talk about how Russia has annexed the Crimea, but the
reality is, the Five Eyes intelligence alliance, principally the United
States, have annexed the whole world as a result of annexing the
computer systems and communications technology that is used to run the
modern world,” stated Julian Assange in his keynote address…
Don’t just read the short article, listen to the address yourself,
because Assange goes into many areas, and the work being done in these
Assange mentions how Debian famously botched the SSL random number
generator for years (which was clearly sabotaged – a known fact).
Speaking of botched security affecting Red Hat, Debian, Ubuntu, Gentoo,
SuSE, *BSD, and more, the nightmarish OpenSSL recently botched SSL again
(very serious – updated comments on how a defense contractor in Finland
outed the NSA here?) It’s very hard to believe this wasn’t deliberate,
as botching the memory space of private keys is about as completely
incompetent as you can get, as this area is ultra-critical to the whole
system. As a result, many private keys, including of providers, were
potentially compromised, and much private info of service users. Be sure
to update your systems as this bug is now public knowledge. (For more on
how OpenSSL is a nightmare, and why this bug is one among many that will
never be found, listen to FreeBSD developer Poul-Heening Kamp’s
excellent talk at the FOSDEM BSD conference.)
From the start, my revelations on this blog about Red Hat’s deep control
of Linux, along with their large corporate/government connections,
hasn’t been just about spying, but about losing the distributed
engineering quality of Linux, with Red Hat centralizing control. Yet as
an ex-cypherpunk and crypto software developer, as soon as I started
using Linux years ago, I noted that all the major distributions used
watered-down encryption (to use stronger encryption in many areas, such
as AES-loop, you needed to compile your own kernel and go to great
lengths to manually bypass barriers they put in place to the use of
genuinely strong encryption). This told me then that those who
controlled distributions were deeply in the pockets of intelligence
networks. So it comes as no surprise to me that they jumped on board
systemd when told to, despite the mock choice publicized to users –
there was never any option.
A computer, and especially hosting services (which often run Linux), are
powerful communication and broadcasting systems into today’s world. If
you control and have unfettered access to such systems, you basically
control the world. As Assange notes in the talk, encryption is only as
strong as its endpoints. eg if you’re running a very secure protocol on
a system with a compromised OS, you’re owned.
As Assange observed:
    “The sharing of information, the communication of free peoples,
across history and across geography, is something that creates,
maintains, and disciplines laws [governments].”

It's as bad as any root-level remote exploit on a server. And because, you know, "everybody uses OpenSSL", and because it was unknown but in the code for 2+ years, the attack surface was (and is) huge.

There are two main meanings of the term "politics".
The one you are referring to is the "pardon-less, dirty fight for power", and is the reason many describe themselves as "apolitical".
The other is the classical "of, for, or relating to citizens":
This is the one I and the parent spoke about. It is not about the temporary/current power struggle, but about the general *policies* regarding... well, anything, really.
For example, the fact that Deric Lostutter faces more jailtime than rapists he ...is a direct effect of hackers not engaging in politics (in the second sense). And a great exemplification of the good old "regardless of whether or not you are interested in politics, politics *will* get interested in you, eventually" rule.
I despise the first version of "politics"; I firmly stand on the position we have to start engaging in the second version, though.

    “Most of the world does not have install privileges on the computer they are using.”
That is, most people using a computer in the world don’t own the computer they are using. Whether it’s in a cafe, or school, or work, for a huge portion of the world, installing a desktop application isn’t a straightforward option. Every week or two, I was being contacted by people desperate for better security and privacy options, and I would try to help them. I’d start, “Download th…” and then we’d stop. The next thing people would tell me was that they couldn’t install software on their computers. Usually this was because an IT department somewhere was limiting their rights as a part of managing a network. These people needed tools that worked with what they had access to, mostly a browser.
So the question I put to hackers, cryptographers, security experts, programmers, and so on was this: What’s the best option for people who can’t download new software to their machines? The answer was unanimous: nothing. They have no options. They are better off talking in plaintext I was told, “so they don’t have a false sense of security.” Since they don’t have access to better software, I was told, they shouldn’t do anything that might upset the people watching them. But, I explained, these are the activists, organizers, and journalists around the world dealing with governments and corporations and criminals that do real harm, the people in real danger. Then they should buy themselves computers, I was told.
That was it, that was the answer: be rich enough to buy your own computer, or literally drop dead. I told people that wasn’t good enough, got vilified in a few inconsequential Twitter fights, and moved on.
Not long after, I realized where the disconnect was. I went back to the same experts and explained: in the wild, in really dangerous situations — even when people are being hunted by men with guns — when encryption and security fails, no one stops talking. They just hope they don’t get caught.
    The same human impulse that has kept lotteries alive for thousands of years keeps people fighting the man against the long odds. “Maybe I’ll get away with it, might as well try!”

Both situations are not great, but one is a bit less bad. Can you spot, which? The same way you get Subrosa on any client right now: write a mobile client for it. Instead of writing a new client-server architecture (which *should* be considered obsolete by now, IMVHO) tool, why not expand upon the completely decentralised projects?

The proposed Bitcoin ban is just that: a law that is not going to be enforced for the general population (as there is no way in hell to do that en masse!), but will definitely be used against selected few individuals that Russian government has beefs with.

    “Most of the world does not have install privileges on the computer they are using.”
That is, most people using a computer in the world don’t own the computer they are using. Whether it’s in a cafe, or school, or work, for a huge portion of the world, installing a desktop application isn’t a straightforward option. Every week or two, I was being contacted by people desperate for better security and privacy options, and I would try to help them. I’d start, “Download th…” and then we’d stop. The next thing people would tell me was that they couldn’t install software on their computers. Usually this was because an IT department somewhere was limiting their rights as a part of managing a network. These people needed tools that worked with what they had access to, mostly a browser.
So the question I put to hackers, cryptographers, security experts, programmers, and so on was this: What’s the best option for people who can’t download new software to their machines? The answer was unanimous: nothing. They have no options. They are better off talking in plaintext I was told, “so they don’t have a false sense of security.” Since they don’t have access to better software, I was told, they shouldn’t do anything that might upset the people watching them. But, I explained, these are the activists, organizers, and journalists around the world dealing with governments and corporations and criminals that do real harm, the people in real danger. Then they should buy themselves computers, I was told.
That was it, that was the answer: be rich enough to buy your own computer, or literally drop dead. I told people that wasn’t good enough, got vilified in a few inconsequential Twitter fights, and moved on.
Not long after, I realized where the disconnect was. I went back to the same experts and explained: in the wild, in really dangerous situations — even when people are being hunted by men with guns — when encryption and security fails, no one stops talking. They just hope they don’t get caught.
    The same human impulse that has kept lotteries alive for thousands of years keeps people fighting the man against the long odds. “Maybe I’ll get away with it, might as well try!”

Yeah, that's a legitimate worry, but one that is far from being black or white (as in: it's really hard to assess the net impact of such a tactic, and how effective it really is).
I would love to see JS disabled by default (blocked via NoScript, which is installed by default in TBB).
Thing is: even with that taken into account, Tor is of great value, as it actually *raises the costs* of surveillance; consider:
One of the things I have learnt during the years of my brushing shoulders with Teh Gummint (public consultations, conferences, etc) is that a huge bureaucracy like a government is bound to have conflicting interests and fund/take conflicting actions.
Governments are not homogeneous, to say the least.
So I can see how a government can fund a tool that is useful for one of the departments or agencies, and which at the same time is detrimental to actions of some other department or agency.
There's no Huge Plan Or Conspiracy behind it. Just Hanlon's razor, if Care to elaborate on the "oddly put together" part?

Well... There are two ways the word "hacking" is used most often.
1. breaking into computer systems and generally doing some computery-evil
   stuff
2. doing some amazing technical things
So, what Aaron did was in no way fitting the 2., right? He just put a laptop in a closet and downloaded stuff.
Neither does it fit 1. -- he did not break any kind of security systems, cracked passwords, etc., he just put a laptop on a network that had access to these documents and downloaded the documents. That's all.
On a different level, it was indeed consistent with hacker ethos, esp. "information wants to be free". But that doesn't mean it was a "hack", in any meaning of the word.

Ah, "hacking the system" is what we all do, what the whole NoisySquare thing was at 30C3, etc. Is that something evil? Is that something to be "killed" Well, I couldn't have put it better myself:
"Aaron didn’t break into JSTOR, he used a valid JSTOR guest account available
 on the MIT campus, which runs an open network. Had he downloaded 1 article
 every day for 4.8 million days, there would have been no problem. Had he
 downloaded 100 articles every day for 48,000 days, that would have been fine
 as well, nobody would have noticed. But he downloaded 4.8 million articles in
 100 days. Somewhere between 100 articles a day and 48,000 articles a day,
 Aaron crossed an invisible line."

MIT *never even made clear* whether or not Aaron was *authorized* to access MIT network:
And as *every* user of MIT network had access to JSTOR, it's also hard to claim that Aaron accessed JSTOR in an "unauthorized" manner. The only problem was the amount of articles Aaron was downloading, and the manner he was doing that (a laptop in a closet).
Whether or not he was authorized to access them is unclear, however there is strong evidence suggesting he was indeed authorized to access MIT network, and hence, through it, JSTOR.

Hi there,
Dnia wtorek, 7 stycznia 2014 23:15:52 Adam Back pisze:
I draw different conclusion here -- people do not understand hackers (in the original, non-pejorative meaning of the term), and hence are afraid of anything "hacker-y". Weev went to jail not because he did something illegal, but because the jury was convinced he's an "evil hacker", and that they need to "send a signal".
If we keep moving back, at some point we'll have nowhere to go.
So instead, we should get people to understand and not be afraid. Show the value to the society (and there is a lot of value in hacking!), and always make clear distinction between hacking (which both Aaron and Weev had done quite a bit of, and I am not referring to their court cases and alleged transgressions) and committing crimes by means of a computer network or electronic device.
As an added bonus, once we get to a point where everybody understands that crime is a crime, regardless of tools used in connection with it, we might finally get some *sane* laws around that topic -- instead of laws that make one get a smaller sentence if they steal stuff with a crowbar instead of downloading it via Teh Tubes.

Maybe it's time to try to get some vendor liability/warranty going? I shudder when thinking about that, as that would pose a huge problem for Free Software, I guess, but I think it is worth exploring anyway.

I'll elaborate (Capt. Obvious, but whatever). The possibilities and technologies of connecting and communicating had made such strides during the last 20 years, that we really do not have to limit ourselves to these two suboptimal (to say the least) situations. We can have a decentralized and non-
controllable network if we want to, and it can piggy-back on or run within any network that is controlled by the government (not sure about balkanized networks but I guess that would also be doable to some extent).
Just use the current "Internet" just as Internet used the telephone system, as infrastructure. The infrastructure was controlled by the government and big telcos -- meh, whatever, we just layered a better network on top.
The other way -- and a great one, but a bit harder -- is mesh networking on or as close to the physical level as possible. Just look what these smart cheese-
lovers are doing:
Think: "we can rebuild the decentralized network, we have the technology" instead of "we're fucked".
Why is it a question that needs answering?

This means 95% of the time as far as information I have already seen is concerned, the AwesomeBar reaching down to my bookmarks is enough to get what I need, no need to go to Google here.
Not that easy, as everybody would need to publish their bookmark RSS/Atom channels not entirely in accordance with how it is being done usually on the 'Net. Usually, only the first 10-30 headlines/items are in the RSS/Atom channel, the older ones (it is assumed) are already cached in users' RSS/Atom  Firefox does not cache live bookmarks, so each time you only get the current 10-30 items, all older are "lost". This makes sense with regard to the intended use of this functionality in Firefox (and other browsers), but unfortunately makes it harder to implement interesting bookmarks sharing the way you described.

What? I call bull. First of all, it's not the corporation's decision, it's a decision made always by *some person*. You don't have to give corporations these rights, as people that corporations consist of already have them. So, the government still cannot make *these people* fire other people for political views.
Secondly, it's all about the responsibility. If the responsibility for decisions stops at corporation level, we're fucked, as we are currently, because people that actually make the decisions (in the end people make decisions, not corporations!) think "whatever, even if something gets fucked up, I'm in the clear, so why bother".
But that still can be solved by bringing the rights and responsibilities down to personal level. If a "secret order" issued to a corporation is in violation of rights of physical people working there (as it seems to be in this case), the order is unlawful, full stop. Solved.
Don't mix the freedom of association with the convenience of removed responsibility, or responsibility attached not to people, but to some legal fiction. The former is crucial, the latter is dangerous.
But corporations are thus ubermensch -- they have all the rights and powers of a person, without many of the responsibilities, with no danger of being imprisoned, and the only real legal sanction the courts (and thus, the rest of people) have against them are fines. Which, if the corporation is large enough, can be factored-in as cost of doing business, hence being passed on to customers. So, passed to other people.
The problem is that our laws and constitutions had been written in times when governments had been by far the biggest threats to personal freedoms, possessions and life. They had posed (and continue to pose) a real threat 1. their sheer power (in terms of money, information, military power, etc)
2. human flaws (power corrupts, etc)

No, because it does not, at least not always. For instance, in Poland there were several cases of Facebook censoring/removing profiles that bashed large corporations for their actions.
Of course multinationals and governments cooperate very closely on this, but it does not mean that for such censorship the government is solely And even if that would be the case -- even if ANY AND ALL cases of censorship and self-censorship in large, centralised, corporate communication and information platforms like Facebook or Google where government-ordered, my take on this would still be that we need to decentralise and spread them out, so as to make it so much harder for governments to censor.
Because instead of going to a few one-stop-shops like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, AT&T, Crapple and getting 95% of communication censored, the government would have to reach out to thousands upon thousands of private companies and persons and make them censor their infrastructure.
Some would agree. Some would not. The latter group is why it's worthwhile.
So any way you look at it, large multinationals are dangerous -- either on their own account, or through the simple fact that they make governments' "work" much, much easier.

Well... There are two ways the word "hacking" is used most often.
1. breaking into computer systems and generally doing some computery-evil
   stuff
2. doing some amazing technical things
So, what Aaron did was in no way fitting the 2., right? He just put a laptop in a closet and downloaded stuff.
Neither does it fit 1. -- he did not break any kind of security systems, cracked passwords, etc., he just put a laptop on a network that had access to these documents and downloaded the documents. That's all.
On a different level, it was indeed consistent with hacker ethos, esp. "information wants to be free". But that doesn't mean it was a "hack", in any meaning of the word.

"Aaron didn’t break into JSTOR, he used a valid JSTOR guest account available

 every day for 4.8 million days, there would have been no problem. Had he
 downloaded 100 articles every day for 48,000 days, that would have been fine

 Aaron crossed an invisible line."

MIT *never even made clear* whether or not Aaron was *authorized* to access MIT network:
And as *every* user of MIT network had access to JSTOR, it's also hard to claim that Aaron accessed JSTOR in an "unauthorized" manner. The only problem was the amount of articles Aaron was downloading, and the manner he was doing that (a laptop in a closet).
Whether or not he was authorized to access them is unclear, however there is strong evidence suggesting he was indeed authorized to access MIT network, and hence, through it, JSTOR.

I draw different conclusion here -- people do not understand hackers (in the original, non-pejorative meaning of the term), and hence are afraid of anything "hacker-y". Weev went to jail not because he did something illegal, but because the jury was convinced he's an "evil hacker", and that they need to "send a signal".
If we keep moving back, at some point we'll have nowhere to go.
So instead, we should get people to understand and not be afraid. Show the value to the society (and there is a lot of value in hacking!), and always make clear distinction between hacking (which both Aaron and Weev had done quite a bit of, and I am not referring to their court cases and alleged transgressions) and committing crimes by means of a computer network or electronic device.
As an added bonus, once we get to a point where everybody understands that crime is a crime, regardless of tools used in connection with it, we might finally get some *sane* laws around that topic -- instead of laws that make one get a smaller sentence if they steal stuff with a crowbar instead of downloading it via Teh Tubes.

I'll elaborate (Capt. Obvious, but whatever). The possibilities and technologies of connecting and communicating had made such strides during the last 20 years, that we really do not have to limit ourselves to these two suboptimal (to say the least) situations. We can have a decentralized and non-
controllable network if we want to, and it can piggy-back on or run within any network that is controlled by the government (not sure about balkanized networks but I guess that would also be doable to some extent).
Just use the current "Internet" just as Internet used the telephone system, as infrastructure. The infrastructure was controlled by the government and big telcos -- meh, whatever, we just layered a better network on top.
The other way -- and a great one, but a bit harder -- is mesh networking on or as close to the physical level as possible. Just look what these smart cheese-

Think: "we can rebuild the decentralized network, we have the technology" instead of "we're fucked".

Because I would say the exact same thing about those who badmouth privacy advocates and privacy itself: obviously those in power have vested interests in violating privacy, be it for monetary, or political gain.
They have vested interests in convincing the unwashed masses that either "privacy is dead", "privacy is not needed" or "privacy is impossible". So that they can more easily spy upon us all, and so that it gets that harder for privacy-conscious people to maintain their privacy (as that is an ecology, if you do not maintain your privacy, information about you might help somebody to deduce information about me).

Not true. You can verify my public actions, my public statements. What matters in the end is if the result is right. If my actions, my statements were conducive towards better privacy or bettering of our common human condition, one can assume with high degree of certainty that my reasons were right.

And information assymetry. That's why we have to build our own tools and use them to guard our own privacy.
Well, there is always the element of trust. I have to (I don't have the time, money, etc to verify myself) trust my hardware and software to some extent.
But I *can* choose hardware and software in a way that should make that trust better founded. Free software, open hardware. I use an "ancient" Nokia N900, which is by far not ideal, still much better than any iPhone.
I can make listeners' lives harder. And I do.
Abso-fucking-lutely! Still, I would like to know what is the threat model you were talking about. I don't see how advocating privacy and anonymity can be sinister -- apart from using these terms in context that these terms have no purpose other than muddying the waters (i.e. "privacy of government agencies or corporations").

It's easy (it just requires a habit of decent tagging), and effective -- when I remember an information I found important from a website I visited, it's usually in my bookmarks, tagged properly. This means 95% of the time as far as information I have already seen is concerned, the AwesomeBar reaching down to my bookmarks is enough to get what I need, no need to go to Google here.
Not that easy, as everybody would need to publish their bookmark RSS/Atom channels not entirely in accordance with how it is being done usually on the 'Net. Usually, only the first 10-30 headlines/items are in the RSS/Atom channel, the older ones (it is assumed) are already cached in users' RSS/Atom  Firefox does not cache live bookmarks, so each time you only get the current 10-30 items, all older are "lost". This makes sense with regard to the intended use of this functionality in Firefox (and other browsers), but unfortunately makes it harder to implement interesting bookmarks sharing the way you described.

In fact, a few international ISPs that operate in Poland (I will not disclose any of the two related colours) are -- as far as I know -- in the process of implementing parental filtering on the national network level. The tech is advanced and less costly than 5 years ago, and now ISPs seem to think that this will be a billable feature for parents.

My point being: we can't rely on corporations. We can use the momentary alliances as they form, but should not rely on them in the long run.
Yeah, but the lawmakers can make the best interest of corporations perfectly aligned with snooping and retention easily -- with law and money. The only place where we can really stop such activities is values/virtues/human rights. And these are foreign and all french to both corporations and politicians.

They are *made of* people. This is not the same thing.
What? I call bull. First of all, it's not the corporation's decision, it's a decision made always by *some person*. You don't have to give corporations these rights, as people that corporations consist of already have them. So, the government still cannot make *these people* fire other people for political views.
Secondly, it's all about the responsibility. If the responsibility for decisions stops at corporation level, we're fucked, as we are currently, because people that actually make the decisions (in the end people make decisions, not corporations!) think "whatever, even if something gets fucked up, I'm in the clear, so why bother".
But that still can be solved by bringing the rights and responsibilities down to personal level. If a "secret order" issued to a corporation is in violation of rights of physical people working there (as it seems to be in this case), the order is unlawful, full stop. Solved.
Don't mix the freedom of association with the convenience of removed responsibility, or responsibility attached not to people, but to some legal fiction. The former is crucial, the latter is dangerous.
But corporations are thus ubermensch -- they have all the rights and powers of a person, without many of the responsibilities, with no danger of being imprisoned, and the only real legal sanction the courts (and thus, the rest of people) have against them are fines. Which, if the corporation is large enough, can be factored-in as cost of doing business, hence being passed on to customers. So, passed to other people.
The problem is that our laws and constitutions had been written in times when governments had been by far the biggest threats to personal freedoms, possessions and life. They had posed (and continue to pose) a real threat 1. their sheer power (in terms of money, information, military power, etc)
2. human flaws (power corrupts, etc)
3. (perceived) removal of responsibility ("what could they do to me anyway")
Today all three (power, human factor and perceived removal of responsibility) is present in largest multinationals. I see no reason to fear them less than In fact, I am dreading the coming day the first corporation announces

Of course multinationals and governments cooperate very closely on this, but it does not mean that for such censorship the government is solely And even if that would be the case -- even if ANY AND ALL cases of censorship and self-censorship in large, centralised, corporate communication and information platforms like Facebook or Google where government-ordered, my take on this would still be that we need to decentralise and spread them out, so as to make it so much harder for governments to censor.
Because instead of going to a few one-stop-shops like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, AT&T, Crapple and getting 95% of communication censored, the government would have to reach out to thousands upon thousands of private companies and persons and make them censor their infrastructure.
Some would agree. Some would not. The latter group is why it's worthwhile.
So any way you look at it, large multinationals are dangerous -- either on their own account, or through the simple fact that they make governments' "work" much, much easier.

I find it additionally interesting that you seem to assume nationality of an Internet contact based on TLD of their e-mail address. That's so cute. Had I written from rys.io domain, would you start off with "hey indian ocean territory", or "hey brit"?

AAAAHH! Now I got all the puzzles in my view. OHAI, CARI. :)
Well... There are two ways the word "hacking" is used most often.
1. breaking into computer systems and generally doing some computery-evil
   stuff
2. doing some amazing technical things
So, what Aaron did was in no way fitting the 2., right? He just put a laptop in a closet and downloaded stuff.
Neither does it fit 1. -- he did not break any kind of security systems, cracked passwords, etc., he just put a laptop on a network that had access to these documents and downloaded the documents. That's all.
On a different level, it was indeed consistent with hacker ethos, esp. "information wants to be free". But that doesn't mean it was a "hack", in any meaning of the word.
Also, inb4 "hacker means X - no, it means Y" shitstorm

Ah, "hacking the system" is what we all do, what the whole NoisySquare thing was at 30C3, etc. Is that something evil? Is that something to be "killed" Well, I couldn't have put it better myself:
"Aaron didn’t break into JSTOR, he used a valid JSTOR guest account available
 on the MIT campus, which runs an open network. Had he downloaded 1 article
 every day for 4.8 million days, there would have been no problem. Had he
 downloaded 100 articles every day for 48,000 days, that would have been fine
 as well, nobody would have noticed. But he downloaded 4.8 million articles in
 100 days. Somewhere between 100 articles a day and 48,000 articles a day,
 Aaron crossed an invisible line."

Wait, what? Where the hell did you get *that* bullshit. MIT network was just fine, the pissed people were at JSTOR, and they were pissed not because "the network was brought down to its knees", but because somebody was getting a lot of articles "without paying".
MIT *never even made clear* whether or not Aaron was *authorized* to access MIT network:
And as *every* user of MIT network had access to JSTOR, it's also hard to claim that Aaron accessed JSTOR in an "unauthorized" manner. The only problem was the amount of articles Aaron was downloading, and the manner he was doing that (a laptop in a closet).
Whether or not he was authorized to access them is unclear, however there is strong evidence suggesting he was indeed authorized to access MIT network, and hence, through it, JSTOR.
So please, get your facts straight.

I draw different conclusion here -- people do not understand hackers (in the original, non-pejorative meaning of the term), and hence are afraid of anything "hacker-y". Weev went to jail not because he did something illegal, but because the jury was convinced he's an "evil hacker", and that they need to "send a signal".
If we keep moving back, at some point we'll have nowhere to go.
So instead, we should get people to understand and not be afraid. Show the value to the society (and there is a lot of value in hacking!), and always make clear distinction between hacking (which both Aaron and Weev had done quite a bit of, and I am not referring to their court cases and alleged transgressions) and committing crimes by means of a computer network or electronic device.
As an added bonus, once we get to a point where everybody understands that crime is a crime, regardless of tools used in connection with it, we might finally get some *sane* laws around that topic -- instead of laws that make one get a smaller sentence if they steal stuff with a crowbar instead of downloading it via Teh Tubes.

I'll elaborate (Capt. Obvious, but whatever). The possibilities and technologies of connecting and communicating had made such strides during the last 20 years, that we really do not have to limit ourselves to these two suboptimal (to say the least) situations. We can have a decentralized and non-
controllable network if we want to, and it can piggy-back on or run within any network that is controlled by the government (not sure about balkanized networks but I guess that would also be doable to some extent).
Just use the current "Internet" just as Internet used the telephone system, as infrastructure. The infrastructure was controlled by the government and big telcos -- meh, whatever, we just layered a better network on top.
The other way -- and a great one, but a bit harder -- is mesh networking on or as close to the physical level as possible. Just look what these smart cheese-

Think: "we can rebuild the decentralized network, we have the technology" instead of "we're fucked".

Ah, apologies. I was unclear. I was refering to the perspective of a community, not the individual (as has Troy, I believe). As in: anonymity poses significant problems for any community that tries to honour it.
For example anonymous remailer trolls and flames on this list are a concrete "cost" of the fact that the list accepts anonymous remailers.
Pseudonymity (along with some reputation-based mechanisms) helps to alleviate that, to some extent, while retaining some of the most important advantages of personal anonymity.
By the way, I'm perfectly okay with the cost-benefit trade-off we're making on this list with anonymous remailers, please do not treat the above as a suggestion (pardon! idea ;) ) to remove that option.

Had there been no "our people" in the bowels of the European Parliament, for example, it would be much harder or nigh impossible.

They are *made of* people. This is not the same thing.
What? I call bull. First of all, it's not the corporation's decision, it's a decision made always by *some person*. You don't have to give corporations these rights, as people that corporations consist of already have them. So, the government still cannot make *these people* fire other people for political views.
Secondly, it's all about the responsibility. If the responsibility for decisions stops at corporation level, we're fucked, as we are currently, because people that actually make the decisions (in the end people make decisions, not corporations!) think "whatever, even if something gets fucked up, I'm in the clear, so why bother".
But that still can be solved by bringing the rights and responsibilities down to personal level. If a "secret order" issued to a corporation is in violation of rights of physical people working there (as it seems to be in this case), the order is unlawful, full stop. Solved.
Don't mix the freedom of association with the convenience of removed responsibility, or responsibility attached not to people, but to some legal fiction. The former is crucial, the latter is dangerous.
But corporations are thus ubermensch -- they have all the rights and powers of a person, without many of the responsibilities, with no danger of being imprisoned, and the only real legal sanction the courts (and thus, the rest of people) have against them are fines. Which, if the corporation is large enough, can be factored-in as cost of doing business, hence being passed on to customers. So, passed to other people.
The problem is that our laws and constitutions had been written in times when governments had been by far the biggest threats to personal freedoms, possessions and life. They had posed (and continue to pose) a real threat 1. their sheer power (in terms of money, information, military power, etc)
2. human flaws (power corrupts, etc)
3. (perceived) removal of responsibility ("what could they do to me anyway")
Today all three (power, human factor and perceived removal of responsibility) is present in largest multinationals. I see no reason to fear them less than In fact, I am dreading the coming day the first corporation announces

Of course multinationals and governments cooperate very closely on this, but it does not mean that for such censorship the government is solely And even if that would be the case -- even if ANY AND ALL cases of censorship and self-censorship in large, centralised, corporate communication and information platforms like Facebook or Google where government-ordered, my take on this would still be that we need to decentralise and spread them out, so as to make it so much harder for governments to censor.
Because instead of going to a few one-stop-shops like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, AT&T, Crapple and getting 95% of communication censored, the government would have to reach out to thousands upon thousands of private companies and persons and make them censor their infrastructure.
Some would agree. Some would not. The latter group is why it's worthwhile.
So any way you look at it, large multinationals are dangerous -- either on their own account, or through the simple fact that they make governments' "work" much, much easier.

Well, some definitions contain Five Eyes country codes as negative matching rules (i.e. IPs from Five Eyes countries will *not* get matched), others do not have this condition.
I find this very surprising as it suggests that Five Eyes and other exclusion rules are possibly defined on a per-fingerprint basis; I would have thought these would rather be implemented somewhere higher-up (i.e. some post-
processing/post-filtering) so that IPs from Five Eyes don't get accidentally snatched due to somebody forgetting to include the rule in their fingerprint.
On the other hand, I guess it can also be the other way around: NSA doesn't give a flying fsck about Five Eyes and the policy is to "grab everything, nobody will know anyway"; the "do not include Five Eyes IPs" rule in one of the fingerprints would then be an overzealous technician including it in the fingerprint because they thought they should ("we don't spy on our friends", Fun stuff either way.

I disagree. The Pirate Party got a lot of media attention thanks to the name, and got a strong support in the beginning. The current crisis is not due to the name, but due to the fact the PP abandoned quite a lot of their original core issues (filesharing, data protection, privacy, etc).
But the PP created a hell of a disruption. Some big parties today have integrated some elements of the original PP platform into their programmes, which is a success regardless of what happens with PP now.
However, I'm a big supporter of the idea of creating a single, strong Commons Party, assimilating the Greens and the Pirate Parties across Europe (and further) into a single force.
When one thinks about it, it makes sense. On some level the Greens and PP have similar core values: protecting the commons -- be it environmental, or digital. They cooperate closely on several issues in the EU already, and yet go to elections separately.

this has been floating in my vincinity lately:
Wonder what you wonderful people think of it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Internet can be a little unfair. It's way too easy for ISPs, telecoms, politicians, and corporations to block access to the sites and information that you care about. But breaking through these restrictions is tough. Or is Introducing Streisand
    A single command sets up a brand new server running a wide variety of anti-censorship software that can completely mask and encrypt all of your Internet traffic.
    Streisand natively supports the creation of new servers at Amazon EC2, DigitalOcean, Linode, and Rackspace—with more providers coming soon! It also runs on any Debian 7 server regardless of provider, and hundreds of instances can be configured simultaneously using this method.
    The process is completely automated and only takes about ten minutes, which is pretty awesome when you consider that it would require the average system administrator several days of frustration to set up even a small subset of what Streisand offers in its out-of-the-box configuration.
    Once your Streisand server is running, you can give the custom connection instructions to friends, family members, and fellow activists. The connection instructions contain an embedded copy of the server's unique SSL certificate, so you only have to send them a single file.
    Each server is entirely self-contained and comes with absolutely everything that users need to get started, including cryptographically verified mirrors of all common clients. This renders any attempted censorship of default download locations completely ineffective.
    But wait, there's more...
More Features
    Nginx powers a password-protected and encrypted Gateway that serves as the starting point for new users. The Gateway is accessible over SSL, or as a Tor hidden service.
        Beautiful, custom, step-by-step client configuration instructions are generated for each new server that Streisand creates. Users can quickly access these instructions through any web browser. The instructions are responsive and look fantastic on mobile phones:
        Streisand Screenshot
        The integrity of mirrored software is ensured using SHA-256 checksums, or by verifying GPG signatures if the project provides them. This protects users from downloading corrupted files.
        All ancillary files, such as OpenVPN configuration profiles, are also available via the Gateway.
        Current Tor users can take advantage of the additional services Streisand sets up in order to transfer large files or to handle other traffic (e.g. BitTorrent) that isn't appropriate for the Tor network.
        A unique password, SSL certificate, and SSL private key are generated for each Streisand Gateway. The Gateway instructions and certificate are transferred via SSH at the conclusion of Streisand's execution.
    Distinct services and multiple daemons provide an enormous amount of flexibility. If one connection method gets blocked there are numerous options available, most of which are resistant to Deep Packet Inspection.
        All of the connection methods (including L2TP/IPsec and direct OpenVPN connections) are effective against the type of blocking Turkey has been experimenting with.
        OpenSSH, OpenVPN (wrapped in stunnel), Shadowsocks, and Tor (with obfsproxy and the obfs3 or ScrambleSuit pluggable transports) are all currently effective against China's Great Firewall.
    Every task has been thoroughly documented and given a detailed description. Streisand is simultaneously the most complete HOWTO in existence for the setup of all of the software it installs, and also the antidote for ever having to do any of this by hand again.
    All software runs on ports that have been deliberately chosen to make simplistic port blocking unrealistic without causing massive collateral damage. OpenVPN, for example, does not run on its default port of 1194, but instead uses port 636, the standard port for LDAP/SSL connections that are beloved by companies worldwide.
        L2TP/IPsec is a notable exception to this rule because the ports cannot be changed without breaking client compatibility
    The IP addresses of connecting clients are never logged. There's nothing to find if a server gets seized or shut down.
Services Provided
    L2TP/IPsec using strongSwan and xl2tpd
        A randomly chosen pre-shared key and password are generated.
        Windows, OS X, Android, and iOS users can all connect using the native VPN support that is built into each operating system without installing any additional software.
        Streisand does not install L2TP/IPsec on Amazon EC2 servers by default because the instances cannot bind directly to their public IP addresses which makes IPsec routing nearly impossible.
    OpenSSH
        An unprivileged forwarding user and SSH keypair are generated for sshuttle and SOCKS capabilities. Windows and Android SSH tunnels are also supported, and a copy of the keypair is exported in the .ppk format that PuTTY         Tinyproxy is installed and bound to localhost. It can be accessed over an SSH tunnel by programs that do not natively support SOCKS and that require an HTTP proxy, such as Twitter for Android.
    OpenVPN
        Self-contained "unified" .ovpn profiles are generated for easy client configuration using only a single file.
        Multiple clients can easily share the same certificates and keys, but five separate sets are generated by default.
        Client DNS resolution is handled via Dnsmasq to prevent DNS leaks.
        TLS Authentication is enabled which helps protect against active probing attacks. Traffic that does not have the proper HMAC is simply dropped.
        The Dante proxy server is set up as a workaround for a bug in Firefox for Android.
    Shadowsocks
        A QR code is generated that can be used to automatically configure the Android and iOS clients by simply taking a picture. You can tag '8.8.8.8' on that concrete wall, or you can glue the Shadowsocks instructions and some QR codes to it instead!
    Stunnel
        Listens for and wraps OpenVPN connections. This makes them look like standard SSL traffic and allows OpenVPN clients to successfully establish tunnels even in the presence of Deep Packet Inspection.
        Unified profiles for stunnel-wrapped OpenVPN connections are generated alongside the direct connection profiles. Detailed instructions are also         The stunnel certificate and key are exported in PKCS  format so they are compatible with other SSL tunneling applications. Notably, this enables OpenVPN for Android to tunnel its traffic through SSLDroid. OpenVPN in China on a mobile device? Yes!
    Tor
        A bridge relay is set up with a random nickname.
        Obfsproxy is installed and configured, including support for the obfs3 and ScrambleSuit pluggable transports.

But the PP created a hell of a disruption. Some big parties today have integrated some elements of the original PP platform into their programmes, which is a success regardless of what happens with PP now.
However, I'm a big supporter of the idea of creating a single, strong Commons Party, assimilating the Greens and the Pirate Parties across Europe (and further) into a single force.
When one thinks about it, it makes sense. On some level the Greens and PP have similar core values: protecting the commons -- be it environmental, or digital. They cooperate closely on several issues in the EU already, and yet go to elections separately.

The way it is, you don't have such control. So you would be giving these away to some orgs you don't like hoping this will get them in hot water with the NSA/the government.
There are two scenarios here. Either you'd be de facto giving a present to the NSA -- and I don't feel like giving the NSA presents; or, it would be an org that works with the NSA, or at least is conducive to whatever the gov does -- hence, the implant-gathered data would not be used.
Of course you could also hit a potential whistleblower within such an organisation, which would be even worse.
Either way, a bad, bad idea.
Forensics is the way here.
Sorry you had bad experiences. I work in an NGO that tries to be at least partially funded by donations, and it's fucking hard. We want to be funded by donations because being funded by grants or sponsors is always a "strings attached" situation, and we need to be as independent as possible. Employees here get decent, but not high, pay, and there are no perks like paid-for cars.

It's oft-used today as a marketing ploy, and when I see it my "snakeoil sense" is actually I don't get that tingling sensation with "runs on Windows and MacOS" usually, because that's usually just a statement of fact, not a marketing bulletpoint that can be used as a leverage with masses today.

@_subject: Streisand: Silence censorship. Automate the effect. 
this has been floating in my vincinity lately:
Wonder what you wonderful people think of it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Internet can be a little unfair. It's way too easy for ISPs, telecoms, politicians, and corporations to block access to the sites and information that you care about. But breaking through these restrictions is tough. Or is Introducing Streisand
    A single command sets up a brand new server running a wide variety of anti-censorship software that can completely mask and encrypt all of your Internet traffic.
    Streisand natively supports the creation of new servers at Amazon EC2, DigitalOcean, Linode, and Rackspace—with more providers coming soon! It also runs on any Debian 7 server regardless of provider, and hundreds of instances can be configured simultaneously using this method.
    The process is completely automated and only takes about ten minutes, which is pretty awesome when you consider that it would require the average system administrator several days of frustration to set up even a small subset of what Streisand offers in its out-of-the-box configuration.
    Once your Streisand server is running, you can give the custom connection instructions to friends, family members, and fellow activists. The connection instructions contain an embedded copy of the server's unique SSL certificate, so you only have to send them a single file.
    Each server is entirely self-contained and comes with absolutely everything that users need to get started, including cryptographically verified mirrors of all common clients. This renders any attempted censorship of default download locations completely ineffective.
    But wait, there's more...
More Features
    Nginx powers a password-protected and encrypted Gateway that serves as the starting point for new users. The Gateway is accessible over SSL, or as a Tor hidden service.
        Beautiful, custom, step-by-step client configuration instructions are generated for each new server that Streisand creates. Users can quickly access these instructions through any web browser. The instructions are responsive and look fantastic on mobile phones:
        Streisand Screenshot
        The integrity of mirrored software is ensured using SHA-256 checksums, or by verifying GPG signatures if the project provides them. This protects users from downloading corrupted files.
        All ancillary files, such as OpenVPN configuration profiles, are also available via the Gateway.
        Current Tor users can take advantage of the additional services Streisand sets up in order to transfer large files or to handle other traffic (e.g. BitTorrent) that isn't appropriate for the Tor network.
        A unique password, SSL certificate, and SSL private key are generated for each Streisand Gateway. The Gateway instructions and certificate are transferred via SSH at the conclusion of Streisand's execution.
    Distinct services and multiple daemons provide an enormous amount of flexibility. If one connection method gets blocked there are numerous options available, most of which are resistant to Deep Packet Inspection.
        All of the connection methods (including L2TP/IPsec and direct OpenVPN connections) are effective against the type of blocking Turkey has been experimenting with.
        OpenSSH, OpenVPN (wrapped in stunnel), Shadowsocks, and Tor (with obfsproxy and the obfs3 or ScrambleSuit pluggable transports) are all currently effective against China's Great Firewall.
    Every task has been thoroughly documented and given a detailed description. Streisand is simultaneously the most complete HOWTO in existence for the setup of all of the software it installs, and also the antidote for ever having to do any of this by hand again.
    All software runs on ports that have been deliberately chosen to make simplistic port blocking unrealistic without causing massive collateral damage. OpenVPN, for example, does not run on its default port of 1194, but instead uses port 636, the standard port for LDAP/SSL connections that are beloved by companies worldwide.
        L2TP/IPsec is a notable exception to this rule because the ports cannot be changed without breaking client compatibility
    The IP addresses of connecting clients are never logged. There's nothing to find if a server gets seized or shut down.
Services Provided
    L2TP/IPsec using strongSwan and xl2tpd
        A randomly chosen pre-shared key and password are generated.

There are two scenarios here. Either you'd be de facto giving a present to the NSA -- and I don't feel like giving the NSA presents; or, it would be an org that works with the NSA, or at least is conducive to whatever the gov does -- hence, the implant-gathered data would not be used.
Of course you could also hit a potential whistleblower within such an organisation, which would be even worse.
Either way, a bad, bad idea.
Forensics is the way here.
Sorry you had bad experiences. I work in an NGO that tries to be at least partially funded by donations, and it's fucking hard. We want to be funded by donations because being funded by grants or sponsors is always a "strings attached" situation, and we need to be as independent as possible. Employees here get decent, but not high, pay, and there are no perks like paid-for cars.

@_subject: Streisand: Silence censorship. Automate the effect. 
this has been floating in my vincinity lately:
Wonder what you wonderful people think of it.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
The Internet can be a little unfair. It's way too easy for ISPs, telecoms, politicians, and corporations to block access to the sites and information that you care about. But breaking through these restrictions is tough. Or is Introducing Streisand
    A single command sets up a brand new server running a wide variety of anti-censorship software that can completely mask and encrypt all of your Internet traffic.
    Streisand natively supports the creation of new servers at Amazon EC2, DigitalOcean, Linode, and Rackspace—with more providers coming soon! It also runs on any Debian 7 server regardless of provider, and hundreds of instances can be configured simultaneously using this method.
    The process is completely automated and only takes about ten minutes, which is pretty awesome when you consider that it would require the average system administrator several days of frustration to set up even a small subset of what Streisand offers in its out-of-the-box configuration.
    Once your Streisand server is running, you can give the custom connection instructions to friends, family members, and fellow activists. The connection instructions contain an embedded copy of the server's unique SSL certificate, so you only have to send them a single file.
    Each server is entirely self-contained and comes with absolutely everything that users need to get started, including cryptographically verified mirrors of all common clients. This renders any attempted censorship of default download locations completely ineffective.
    But wait, there's more...
More Features
    Nginx powers a password-protected and encrypted Gateway that serves as the starting point for new users. The Gateway is accessible over SSL, or as a Tor hidden service.
        Beautiful, custom, step-by-step client configuration instructions are generated for each new server that Streisand creates. Users can quickly access these instructions through any web browser. The instructions are responsive and look fantastic on mobile phones:
        Streisand Screenshot
        The integrity of mirrored software is ensured using SHA-256 checksums, or by verifying GPG signatures if the project provides them. This protects users from downloading corrupted files.
        All ancillary files, such as OpenVPN configuration profiles, are also available via the Gateway.
        Current Tor users can take advantage of the additional services Streisand sets up in order to transfer large files or to handle other traffic (e.g. BitTorrent) that isn't appropriate for the Tor network.
        A unique password, SSL certificate, and SSL private key are generated for each Streisand Gateway. The Gateway instructions and certificate are transferred via SSH at the conclusion of Streisand's execution.
    Distinct services and multiple daemons provide an enormous amount of flexibility. If one connection method gets blocked there are numerous options available, most of which are resistant to Deep Packet Inspection.
        All of the connection methods (including L2TP/IPsec and direct OpenVPN connections) are effective against the type of blocking Turkey has been experimenting with.
        OpenSSH, OpenVPN (wrapped in stunnel), Shadowsocks, and Tor (with obfsproxy and the obfs3 or ScrambleSuit pluggable transports) are all currently effective against China's Great Firewall.
    Every task has been thoroughly documented and given a detailed description. Streisand is simultaneously the most complete HOWTO in existence for the setup of all of the software it installs, and also the antidote for ever having to do any of this by hand again.
    All software runs on ports that have been deliberately chosen to make simplistic port blocking unrealistic without causing massive collateral damage. OpenVPN, for example, does not run on its default port of 1194, but instead uses port 636, the standard port for LDAP/SSL connections that are beloved by companies worldwide.
        L2TP/IPsec is a notable exception to this rule because the ports cannot be changed without breaking client compatibility
    The IP addresses of connecting clients are never logged. There's nothing to find if a server gets seized or shut down.
Services Provided
    L2TP/IPsec using strongSwan and xl2tpd
        A randomly chosen pre-shared key and password are generated.
        Windows, OS X, Android, and iOS users can all connect using the native VPN support that is built into each operating system without installing any additional software.
        Streisand does not install L2TP/IPsec on Amazon EC2 servers by default because the instances cannot bind directly to their public IP addresses which makes IPsec routing nearly impossible.
    OpenSSH
        An unprivileged forwarding user and SSH keypair are generated for sshuttle and SOCKS capabilities. Windows and Android SSH tunnels are also supported, and a copy of the keypair is exported in the .ppk format that PuTTY         Tinyproxy is installed and bound to localhost. It can be accessed over an SSH tunnel by programs that do not natively support SOCKS and that require an HTTP proxy, such as Twitter for Android.
    OpenVPN
        Self-contained "unified" .ovpn profiles are generated for easy client configuration using only a single file.
        Multiple clients can easily share the same certificates and keys, but five separate sets are generated by default.
        Client DNS resolution is handled via Dnsmasq to prevent DNS leaks.
        TLS Authentication is enabled which helps protect against active probing attacks. Traffic that does not have the proper HMAC is simply dropped.
        The Dante proxy server is set up as a workaround for a bug in Firefox for Android.
    Shadowsocks
        A QR code is generated that can be used to automatically configure the Android and iOS clients by simply taking a picture. You can tag '8.8.8.8' on that concrete wall, or you can glue the Shadowsocks instructions and some QR codes to it instead!
    Stunnel
        Listens for and wraps OpenVPN connections. This makes them look like standard SSL traffic and allows OpenVPN clients to successfully establish tunnels even in the presence of Deep Packet Inspection.
        Unified profiles for stunnel-wrapped OpenVPN connections are generated alongside the direct connection profiles. Detailed instructions are also         The stunnel certificate and key are exported in PKCS  format so they are compatible with other SSL tunneling applications. Notably, this enables OpenVPN for Android to tunnel its traffic through SSLDroid. OpenVPN in China on a mobile device? Yes!
    Tor
        A bridge relay is set up with a random nickname.
        Obfsproxy is installed and configured, including support for the obfs3 and ScrambleSuit pluggable transports.

Hi there,
in a different thread, Cam posted a link containing this gem:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
In short several very skilled security auditors examined a small Python program — about 100 lines of code — into which three bugs had been inserted by the authors. There was an “easy,” “medium,” and “hard” backdoor. There were three or four teams of auditors.
1. One auditor found the “easy” and the “medium” ones in about 70 minutes, and then spent the rest of the day failing to find any other bugs.
2. One team of two auditors found the “easy” bug in about five hours, and spent the rest of the day failing to find any other bugs.
3. One auditor found the “easy” bug in about four hours, and then stopped.
4. One auditor either found no bugs or else was on a team with the third auditor — the report is unclear.
See Chapter 7 of Yee’s report for these details.
I should emphasize that that I personally consider these people to be extremely skilled. One possible conclusion that could be drawn from this experience is that a skilled backdoor-writer can defeat skilled auditors. This hypothesis holds that only accidental bugs can be reliably detected by auditors, not deliberately hidden bugs.
Anyway, as far as I understand the bugs you folks left in were accidental bugs that you then deliberately didn’t-fix, rather than bugs that you intentionally made hard-to-spot.

Well, actually, you haven't really stated anything. You just said "grarpamp, you're wrong", without saying anything about in what manner he supposedly is wrong, and why you think he is wrong.
See, the problem is not that we disagree, the problem is that so far you haven't really said anything. grarpamp stipulated that "X" works, or so he has heard, you said "nope" and neither of you offered any support.
I can find some support for grarpamp's stipulation in my own practice and history, and while I appreciate your smirk cynicism, saying "read political theory" is simply not enough of an argument.
Not to mention, neither I nor grarpamp said anything on what is the exact mechanism of how civil participation works. For instance, I would be the first to admit that it's not a silver bullet and I'm far from the naïve, idealistic view of "politicians really listen to what we write"; rather, usually, it's a game of interests, and sometimes -- like during the ACTA crisis in EU -- public involvement can be just the straw that's needed to change something.
And your solution instead is what exactly? "Nah, sit on yer arse, nothing's gonna change"? That sounds familiar:

So, the extension itself will be FLOSS, as I understand, so the extension itself will be audit-able (inb4 openssl, truecrypt). And as I understand it *will* be installable in Chromium too.
Is that an acceptable combination? With such an assumption ("use Chromium, Luke!"), does End-to-End seem to make sense? Or are there other problems we need to look into and be wary of?

Hi there,
in a different thread, Cam posted a link containing this gem:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
In short several very skilled security auditors examined a small Python program — about 100 lines of code — into which three bugs had been inserted by the authors. There was an “easy,” “medium,” and “hard” backdoor. There were three or four teams of auditors.
1. One auditor found the “easy” and the “medium” ones in about 70 minutes, and then spent the rest of the day failing to find any other bugs.
2. One team of two auditors found the “easy” bug in about five hours, and spent the rest of the day failing to find any other bugs.
3. One auditor found the “easy” bug in about four hours, and then stopped.
4. One auditor either found no bugs or else was on a team with the third auditor — the report is unclear.
See Chapter 7 of Yee’s report for these details.
I should emphasize that that I personally consider these people to be extremely skilled. One possible conclusion that could be drawn from this experience is that a skilled backdoor-writer can defeat skilled auditors. This hypothesis holds that only accidental bugs can be reliably detected by auditors, not deliberately hidden bugs.
Anyway, as far as I understand the bugs you folks left in were accidental bugs that you then deliberately didn’t-fix, rather than bugs that you intentionally made hard-to-spot.

See, the problem is not that we disagree, the problem is that so far you haven't really said anything. grarpamp stipulated that "X" works, or so he has heard, you said "nope" and neither of you offered any support.
I can find some support for grarpamp's stipulation in my own practice and history, and while I appreciate your smirk cynicism, saying "read political theory" is simply not enough of an argument.
Not to mention, neither I nor grarpamp said anything on what is the exact mechanism of how civil participation works. For instance, I would be the first to admit that it's not a silver bullet and I'm far from the naïve, idealistic view of "politicians really listen to what we write"; rather, usually, it's a game of interests, and sometimes -- like during the ACTA crisis in EU -- public involvement can be just the straw that's needed to change something.

This is close to the tinfoil hat territory, but what if...
 - hack target's corporate email
 - hack target's social network
 - observe them (via webcams, etc)
 - generate psychological profile
 - plant search results  - distract target with emails from the boss and social network posts
 - target leaves child in a hot car
 - target goes to jail. Much cleaner than drones or assassination.
But where's the 'profit' part? There's got to be profit here somewhere...
What, if any, defence is there to this kind of social-engineering attack?

Which might not be all that important on cpunks, I give you that, but a rule is a rule. ;)

this has been proposed:
"The vision of the SSL Co-operative is to be a professionally-operated,
 member-controlled globally-trusted Certification Authority, serving the
 identity verification and management needs of its members.
 At present, this initiative is in the analysis and planning stage.
 Investigation is underway to determine the full set of costs involved, both
 financial and temporal.
 If you think a member-controlled CA that puts the interests of its members,
 and that of the Internet community, ahead of profits is a good idea, and
 might consider being a member if it gets off the ground, I would appreciate
 it if you would fill out a short survey letting me know a little bit about
 your organisation, to ensure that the co-op best serves your needs."

And I'm sure we'll all hear about this very project on this list, as soon as Juan gets the documentation in order (*obviously* the code is perfect, so no need to get that in order, duh!).
While I applaud the strive for a perfect documentation before release, really Juan, "release early, release often"; we'd all be glad to help!

 - generate psychological profile
 - plant search results  - distract target with emails from the boss and social network posts
 - target leaves child in a hot car

Why? Because instead of creating a new "cyber"/"comsec" right, it's high time we uphold the rights we already have. Otherwise, once a new technology comes, we will have to fight this fight all over again -- as this will no longer be "comsec", but (say) "quantumsec".

Hi there,
As I am running a local cryptoparty and do a lot of basic encryption/privacy talks and workshops, I am often recommending Tor as one of the means of protecting one's privacy and yes, even security (for example, by running a hidden service and making it possible for users not to leave the darknet).
Of course it's far from being enough, and I make that very clear.
But lately I got to wonder if using Tor does more harm than good? If the NSA can impersonate any IP on the planet, they can impersonate any Tor node; tis has two important consequences:
1. they know when you're using Tor, and can flag you accordingly, and (for
   example) deliver some nastiness when (not "if"!) they get the chance,
   because "when you have something to hide..."
2. they can guess with high probability whom are you communicating with; they
   don't have to break encryption, it's enough they listen-in and see that a
   Tor packet from your IP to Node A is x bytes; a packet from Node A to Node
   B is x-( header + Tor encryption layer size ) bytes, and so on.
So, is using Tor today doing more harm than good? Would ordinary Joe Schmoes be far better of not using Tor? How about more high-profile targets, like activists/hacktivists, etc?

For Joe Schmoe, is it better to use Tor, or to hide in the noise?
I guess one part of the question is the fact that NSA probably doesn't really have to break encryption, they just need info on who is communicating with whom, exploit one of these endpoints and get all the unencrypted logs, data, etc they want.

We don't need it. We have the secrecy of correspondence in most democratic Well, the US kind of needs to get it into the Bill of Rights, maybe, but not as "comsec", but as plain old "secrecy of correspondence".
Why? Because instead of creating a new "cyber"/"comsec" right, it's high time we uphold the rights we already have. Otherwise, once a new technology comes, we will have to fight this fight all over again -- as this will no longer be "comsec", but (say) "quantumsec".
Again, where we have secrecy of correspondence already -- let's enforce it; where it is not there, it needs to be implemented and enshrined in law. But only as a general rule of "secrecy of correspondence", not as "comsec", not as "postal secrecy", not as "telephone privacy", as otherwise we will have the same discussion in 5-10 years all over again.

As far as I understand the idea, blocking would not aim at making it impossible for the NSA to listen-in; instead, it would be a retaliatory tactic, a way of saying "fuck you, we do not like what you're doing".

But it would require a lot of balls from these companies. Balls which (I have a hunch) people like Zuckerberg might lack.

@_subject: To Tor or not to Tor? 
Hi there,
As I am running a local cryptoparty and do a lot of basic encryption/privacy talks and workshops, I am often recommending Tor as one of the means of protecting one's privacy and yes, even security (for example, by running a hidden service and making it possible for users not to leave the darknet).
Of course it's far from being enough, and I make that very clear.
But lately I got to wonder if using Tor does more harm than good? If the NSA can impersonate any IP on the planet, they can impersonate any Tor node; tis has two important consequences:
1. they know when you're using Tor, and can flag you accordingly, and (for
   example) deliver some nastiness when (not "if"!) they get the chance,
   because "when you have something to hide..."
2. they can guess with high probability whom are you communicating with; they
   don't have to break encryption, it's enough they listen-in and see that a
   Tor packet from your IP to Node A is x bytes; a packet from Node A to Node
   B is x-( header + Tor encryption layer size ) bytes, and so on.
So, is using Tor today doing more harm than good? Would ordinary Joe Schmoes be far better of not using Tor? How about more high-profile targets, like activists/hacktivists, etc?

I am well aware of this argument, and I use it often. My question here is different: with all the info we have about Snowden, QUANTUM, etc, and with the number of Tor users today, AND with some Tor design choices (like: not padding the packets so that each packet, regardless of between which nodes it is sent and how many encryption layers have already beed removed -- has the same length, which would make it that much harder to do traffic analysis), is it PRACTICALLY REALLY better to use Tor, OR does it get people flagged and exploited in other ways?
For Joe Schmoe, is it better to use Tor, or to hide in the noise?
I guess one part of the question is the fact that NSA probably doesn't really have to break encryption, they just need info on who is communicating with whom, exploit one of these endpoints and get all the unencrypted logs, data, etc they want.

Ok, I was not being very clear what I meant.
I meant a situation in which the NSA can listen-in on any connection in the clearnet, including connections between Tor nodes. They *can't* break the encryption nor do they have the keys...
...*But* (esp. if most of these nodes are in the US) they *can* observe that in sequence there are packets being sent between IP1, IP2, IP3 and IP4, and that these packets get smaller at each step, in a way that is coherent with removing layers of Tor encryption.
What they can get from that is information; IP1 is communicating via Tor with So now they know whom to target with QUANTUM when they'd be using clearnet for Tor encryption gets less relevant if NSA gets access to the endpoints via other means, and for that they need to know whom to target. Observing packets flying between Tor nodes can give them that info -- at least that's a suggestion somebody made elsewhere.
So my question is, does that make sense? Is that a viable threat?

Wait, this is actually much better than the standard canary "We have not received NSL yet".
In the standard canary case, a court can supposedly order you to lie. But with such a short-lived (one-day) message of "We have not received an NSL during the last 24 hours", published via RSS, a third-party could set-up a monitoring website that automagically federates any such "canary feed", and as soon as any of them has a single day of lack of suck message just mark it as "possibly received NSL on ", or even "did not confirm that did not receive an NSL on ".
The person that received the NSL can then be forced to keep publishing the "We have not received NSL today" message, but the signal has been sent already, and there would have to be a yet another NSL to the federation service Bonus: the NSL can even make the original addressee publish "We have never received an NSL", which would be even a stronger signal.
If there are several such operators, this becomes more and more non-trivial.

Wait, this is actually much better than the standard canary "We have not received NSL yet".
In the standard canary case, a court can supposedly order you to lie. But with such a short-lived (one-day) message of "We have not received an NSL during the last 24 hours", published via RSS, a third-party could set-up a monitoring website that automagically federates any such "canary feed", and as soon as any of them has a single day of lack of suck message just mark it as "possibly received NSL on ", or even "did not confirm that did not receive an NSL on ".
The person that received the NSL can then be forced to keep publishing the "We have not received NSL today" message, but the signal has been sent already, and there would have to be a yet another NSL to the federation service Bonus: the NSL can even make the original addressee publish "We have never received an NSL", which would be even a stronger signal.
If there are several such operators, this becomes more and more non-trivial.

I find OpenSSL use in RetroShare a smaller problem than the fact that a user of any GPG-enabled e-mail client can actually send an unencrypted e-mail and... not notice that until its too late. Not to mention metadata (sender, addressee, topic, etc, not being GPG-encrypted).

Well, Diaspora, Friendica and Red are already talking to each other with a common protocol; Friendica and StatusNet/GNU Social are also compatible. So The Federation (as was proposed to name the common network-of-social-networs) is already based on 4 different networks; others are finally starting to think about getting on the interoperability bandwagon.
Compare and contrast to what was going on 2 years ago:
Tl;dr of that thread is "not invented here, impossiburu, we won't bother". Methinks we've done some progress.
Well, Diaspora's interface is really fine these days. Friendica needs a lot of love; Red I don't personally know.
Lack of client API is a huge problem, though. Here's a nice poll about what users want/need:
Client API wins hands down.
Well, as I said, Diaspora, Friendica, Red and GNU Social are already talking with each other with common protocols.

And my answer to this is: whatever floats your boat.
The biggest problem right now is the network effect and fragmentation, XMPP crowd (are you compatible with BuddyCloud, for example?) does not seem to help out in this department, so I'm going to promote The Federation, because it already has the userbase and it already federates between several networks.
I have no particular preference of a particular protocol. The Federation already federates, and that's what counds.

Oh, wow. Do you even understand the words that you use? I mean, "proprietary"? It's documented, the code is open, the protocol has at least two FLOSS implementations. Seriously, what were you trying to achieve here?
No. They created a protocol that other networks implement. For example Friendica implements GNU Social's protocol, Diaspora's protocol and their own (documented, opensourced) protocol. Red similarily.
Reading a bit on it would be a good idea.
No. Come to The Federation assembly at  get involved in a more meaningful way than calling open protocols "proprietary" just because you don't know them, and try working with quite a few projects that already cooperate and federate with common *protocols* (not APIs).
The question is not "which protocol is better", because while we bikeshed on this question, people are still sitting on Failbroke and Shitter, instead of moving out of these walled gardens.
The question is: "how can we *cooperate* to get people on the libre, federated side of social networks". 1.5 year ago I submitted to all the fedsocnet devs a simple question, here's the link again:
The answer was: "impossiburu, we won't, not invented here, my protocol is better than yours". So instead of trying to herd those cats, I am grabbing the opportunity arising from the fact that we already have The Federation. Let's expand it and build upon it, eh?
Shouting "XMPP! XMPP!" is not helping.

Always a pleasure.
No. To have a single name for these few federated social networks that already federate with each other. So that instead of saying "do you have a Diaspora/Friendica/Red/GNU Social account?" one can say "do you have a The Federation account?"
Because this will:
 - make it easier for the normal users to join ("just choose any of these,
   they're compatible")
 - make it more interesting for developers of other free federated social
   networks to get compatible with The Federation ("it's not a single project,
   a few of them got together already, why not join the happy bunch")
And in the end it's all about this:
Each of these projects in itself is too small to get users' attention; together they have much more chance of that.
Nobody needs nor wants to define nor create any new protocols. The protocols are already there: that's what Diaspora, Friendica, Red and GNU Social use to talk to each other.
The ONLY aim of calling it with a collective name is to make it seen as a single, huge, federated-and-federating distributed social network. And to get the ball rolling on more social networks joining-in and federating.
They already do. They implement each others' protocols. Nobody has to do anything there. I have a Diaspora account and have added friends from Friendica and Red servers.
But thanks anyway.
"I guess I'll leave that one until you answer Meredith" would be one answer. "I prefer to contribute and improve a ~40 years old protocol with billions of users and thousands of implementations (...)" and direct you to e-mail (which allows you to share photos and info with your friends, after all), would be another, admittedly snarky.
"So how is JID/Jingle client and server implementation work going", would be yet another.
"You're very welcome to join The Federation, if you'd like; the easiest way to do this would be to either help The Federation projects implement your protocol, or implement one of their protocols in your software; in return you'll get a huge bunch of active users to federate with, and the user-
perceived value of your network would rise" is the one I'm going with, Also, Diaspora is implementing an XMPP-based chat functionality these days (should be released soon). So, there's also that.

I disagree. The small number of users and the confusion of which network to use is a real problem, related to the network effect aka Metcalfe's law:
The same problem exists with truly distributed social networks, like SocialSwarm, MaidSafe, Twister et al. How should a user decide which one they should use?
Let's make that step easier by at least making an attempt at interoperability.
To some extent you're right.
I don't agree. These systems already have tens of thousands of users, and getting these users together on a single network is one of the challanges.
How do you know they can't scale? I see Diaspora scaling pretty well so far.
And as far as hiding data from governments is concerned -- sure I'd prefer everybody to jump into RetroShare, but that's not gonna happen. And a decentralized system is much better, privacy-wise, than a centralized one, even if it's not perfect.
Fair enough. But it already has hundreds of thousands of users.
For me, the endgame is indeed complete decentralisation and peer-to-peer social networking, a'la SocialSwarm, RetroShare and Twister. None of these are ready yet, though, the way Diaspora or Friendica are ready and usable today.
So I'd rather help people switch to Diaspora or Friendica today rather than have them wait unspecified amount of time fort the Golden Age of Social Because once we have them on the free software, decentralised, federated sid, we can write bridges/gateways, and have SocialSwarm connect with userbase on The Federation.
That's not possibble with *any* walled garden.
But my girfriend doesn't have to use *my* server, she can choose any of the tens of pods worldwide.
So, this is interesting:
RedMatrix supports end-to-end encryption.
No, they're not. Still, many federating servers controlled by different people is much better than a single, centrally controlled network.
Somewhere there's a video of Bruce Schneier talking about how 10000 different small and medium e-mail providers is so much better a situation, than 10 large ones. That's exactly my point here.
It is indeed. But if they have to do it on 10000 different servers, that's a different ball game than when they have to do it on 10 or 100.
As above.
You know what? At this point let me say from the depth of my heart: fuck you.
Don't you dare lecture me on Snowden and privacy. The fact that I have different take-away from these revelations (e.g. "done now is better than perfect in a decade") doesn't give you the right to be a condescending little prick, smirking with contempt from your high horse of theoretical technical superiority with not much to show for it but a few texts critical of projects that work *here and now*.
Where's the code? Where are the tools? How can I get involved? Can I test anything, apart from your ability to throw tantrums? Please don't tell me that's all you've got in the pipeline since 28C3!
Here are some news for you: FreedomBox is not yet usable. SocialSwarm is not yet usable. I'd love them to be, but they're simply not.
And while you berate others about how they act as if "Snowden didn't happen", these others are getting people off of Facebook at least, today. That's not perfect, but it's a *step*. A step you can either try to build upon, or a step you can try to undermine. Guess which has a higher chance of eventually solving most or all of the problems you mentioned?
Here, have a read:
Especially the "In the end, it’s culture that’s broken" part. Come back when you do.
Had my grandmother had mustache, she would be my grandfather, as we say in Poland. Cry me a fucking river.
Also, had you spend the time you have spent writing this e-mail on development work, you'd be a few steps closer to your goal. So, there's that.
What, now it's my fault that people that are completely unrelated to me and that make their own decisions are working on project A instead of project B which you tend to prefer? How sad is your world, how filled with bile must you be that your pet project is not my pet project, or Friendica/Diaspora/Red developers' pet project!
Go out, talk, explain, reach out and convince people it's worthwhile to invest their time and effort in your idea. Heck, convince me that's worthwhile and that it will get people off of Facebook sooner than in a decade, and I might start helping you out!
Hint: blaming me for your own problems with communication and having a fit over other people taking different paths than yours is not the perfect strategy for that.
Ever thought that might somehow be related to how you go about introducing people to your ideas, maybe?

Well, "criticism" maybe, but then again should you be busy building your perfect solution from ground up, instead of criticising other people's temporary solutions today? ;)
Ah, yes. There we are. :)
There will always be different approaches to such things. Sometimes it *does* make sense to wait for the perfect solution; sometimes it *does* make sense to use harm reduction techniques. The demarcation line is *not* clear and depends heavily on circumstances.
Hence, throwing any incomplete solution out just because it's incomplete, without looking at what a particular threat model is and if maybe, just maybe, it can lower the threat level to people that would be otherwise completely exposed, is disingenuous.

Well, Diaspora, Friendica and Red are already talking to each other with a common protocol; Friendica and StatusNet/GNU Social are also compatible. So The Federation (as was proposed to name the common network-of-social-networs) is already based on 4 different networks; others are finally starting to think about getting on the interoperability bandwagon.
Compare and contrast to what was going on 2 years ago:
Tl;dr of that thread is "not invented here, impossiburu, we won't bother". Methinks we've done some progress.
Well, Diaspora's interface is really fine these days. Friendica needs a lot of love; Red I don't personally know.
Lack of client API is a huge problem, though. Here's a nice poll about what users want/need:
Client API wins hands down.
Well, as I said, Diaspora, Friendica, Red and GNU Social are already talking with each other with common protocols.

I have no particular preference of a particular protocol. The Federation already federates, and that's what counds.

Oh, wow. Do you even understand the words that you use? I mean, "proprietary"? It's documented, the code is open, the protocol has at least two FLOSS implementations. Seriously, what were you trying to achieve here?
No. They created a protocol that other networks implement. For example Friendica implements GNU Social's protocol, Diaspora's protocol and their own (documented, opensourced) protocol. Red similarily.
Reading a bit on it would be a good idea.
No. Come to The Federation assembly at  get involved in a more meaningful way than calling open protocols "proprietary" just because you don't know them, and try working with quite a few projects that already cooperate and federate with common *protocols* (not APIs).
The question is not "which protocol is better", because while we bikeshed on this question, people are still sitting on Failbroke and Shitter, instead of moving out of these walled gardens.
The question is: "how can we *cooperate* to get people on the libre, federated side of social networks". 1.5 year ago I submitted to all the fedsocnet devs a simple question, here's the link again:
The answer was: "impossiburu, we won't, not invented here, my protocol is better than yours". So instead of trying to herd those cats, I am grabbing the opportunity arising from the fact that we already have The Federation. Let's expand it and build upon it, eh?

Always a pleasure.
No. To have a single name for these few federated social networks that already federate with each other. So that instead of saying "do you have a Diaspora/Friendica/Red/GNU Social account?" one can say "do you have a The Federation account?"
Because this will:
 - make it easier for the normal users to join ("just choose any of these,
   they're compatible")
 - make it more interesting for developers of other free federated social
   networks to get compatible with The Federation ("it's not a single project,
   a few of them got together already, why not join the happy bunch")
And in the end it's all about this:
Each of these projects in itself is too small to get users' attention; together they have much more chance of that.
Nobody needs nor wants to define nor create any new protocols. The protocols are already there: that's what Diaspora, Friendica, Red and GNU Social use to talk to each other.
The ONLY aim of calling it with a collective name is to make it seen as a single, huge, federated-and-federating distributed social network. And to get the ball rolling on more social networks joining-in and federating.
They already do. They implement each others' protocols. Nobody has to do anything there. I have a Diaspora account and have added friends from Friendica and Red servers.
But thanks anyway.
"I guess I'll leave that one until you answer Meredith" would be one answer. "I prefer to contribute and improve a ~40 years old protocol with billions of users and thousands of implementations (...)" and direct you to e-mail (which allows you to share photos and info with your friends, after all), would be another, admittedly snarky.
"So how is JID/Jingle client and server implementation work going", would be yet another.
"You're very welcome to join The Federation, if you'd like; the easiest way to do this would be to either help The Federation projects implement your protocol, or implement one of their protocols in your software; in return you'll get a huge bunch of active users to federate with, and the user-
perceived value of your network would rise" is the one I'm going with, Also, Diaspora is implementing an XMPP-based chat functionality these days (should be released soon). So, there's also that.

I disagree. The small number of users and the confusion of which network to use is a real problem, related to the network effect aka Metcalfe's law:
The same problem exists with truly distributed social networks, like SocialSwarm, MaidSafe, Twister et al. How should a user decide which one they should use?
Let's make that step easier by at least making an attempt at interoperability.
To some extent you're right.
I don't agree. These systems already have tens of thousands of users, and getting these users together on a single network is one of the challanges.
How do you know they can't scale? I see Diaspora scaling pretty well so far.
And as far as hiding data from governments is concerned -- sure I'd prefer everybody to jump into RetroShare, but that's not gonna happen. And a decentralized system is much better, privacy-wise, than a centralized one, even if it's not perfect.
Fair enough. But it already has hundreds of thousands of users.
For me, the endgame is indeed complete decentralisation and peer-to-peer social networking, a'la SocialSwarm, RetroShare and Twister. None of these are ready yet, though, the way Diaspora or Friendica are ready and usable today.
So I'd rather help people switch to Diaspora or Friendica today rather than have them wait unspecified amount of time fort the Golden Age of Social Because once we have them on the free software, decentralised, federated sid, we can write bridges/gateways, and have SocialSwarm connect with userbase on The Federation.
That's not possibble with *any* walled garden.
But my girfriend doesn't have to use *my* server, she can choose any of the tens of pods worldwide.
So, this is interesting:
RedMatrix supports end-to-end encryption.
No, they're not. Still, many federating servers controlled by different people is much better than a single, centrally controlled network.
Somewhere there's a video of Bruce Schneier talking about how 10000 different small and medium e-mail providers is so much better a situation, than 10 large ones. That's exactly my point here.
It is indeed. But if they have to do it on 10000 different servers, that's a different ball game than when they have to do it on 10 or 100.
As above.
You know what? At this point let me say from the depth of my heart: fuck you.
Don't you dare lecture me on Snowden and privacy. The fact that I have different take-away from these revelations (e.g. "done now is better than perfect in a decade") doesn't give you the right to be a condescending little prick, smirking with contempt from your high horse of theoretical technical superiority with not much to show for it but a few texts critical of projects that work *here and now*.
Where's the code? Where are the tools? How can I get involved? Can I test anything, apart from your ability to throw tantrums? Please don't tell me that's all you've got in the pipeline since 28C3!
Here are some news for you: FreedomBox is not yet usable. SocialSwarm is not yet usable. I'd love them to be, but they're simply not.
And while you berate others about how they act as if "Snowden didn't happen", these others are getting people off of Facebook at least, today. That's not perfect, but it's a *step*. A step you can either try to build upon, or a step you can try to undermine. Guess which has a higher chance of eventually solving most or all of the problems you mentioned?
Here, have a read:
Especially the "In the end, it’s culture that’s broken" part. Come back when you do.
Had my grandmother had mustache, she would be my grandfather, as we say in Poland. Cry me a fucking river.
Also, had you spend the time you have spent writing this e-mail on development work, you'd be a few steps closer to your goal. So, there's that.
What, now it's my fault that people that are completely unrelated to me and that make their own decisions are working on project A instead of project B which you tend to prefer? How sad is your world, how filled with bile must you be that your pet project is not my pet project, or Friendica/Diaspora/Red developers' pet project!
Go out, talk, explain, reach out and convince people it's worthwhile to invest their time and effort in your idea. Heck, convince me that's worthwhile and that it will get people off of Facebook sooner than in a decade, and I might start helping you out!
Hint: blaming me for your own problems with communication and having a fit over other people taking different paths than yours is not the perfect strategy for that.
Ever thought that might somehow be related to how you go about introducing people to your ideas, maybe?

Somewhere there's a video of Bruce Schneier talking about how 10000 different small and medium e-mail providers is so much better a situation, than 10 large ones. That's exactly my point here.
It is indeed. But if they have to do it on 10000 different servers, that's a different ball game than when they have to do it on 10 or 100.
As above.
You know what? At this point let me say from the depth of my heart: fuck you.
Don't you dare lecture me on Snowden and privacy. The fact that I have different take-away from these revelations (e.g. "done now is better than perfect in a decade") doesn't give you the right to be a condescending little prick, smirking with contempt from your high horse of theoretical technical superiority with not much to show for it but a few texts critical of projects that work *here and now*.
Where's the code? Where are the tools? How can I get involved? Can I test anything, apart from your ability to throw tantrums? Please don't tell me that's all you've got in the pipeline since 28C3!
Here are some news for you: FreedomBox is not yet usable. SocialSwarm is not yet usable. I'd love them to be, but they're simply not.
And while you berate others about how they act as if "Snowden didn't happen", these others are getting people off of Facebook at least, today. That's not perfect, but it's a *step*. A step you can either try to build upon, or a step you can try to undermine. Guess which has a higher chance of eventually solving most or all of the problems you mentioned?
Here, have a read:
Especially the "In the end, it’s culture that’s broken" part. Come back when you do.
Had my grandmother had mustache, she would be my grandfather, as we say in Poland. Cry me a fucking river.
Also, had you spend the time you have spent writing this e-mail on development work, you'd be a few steps closer to your goal. So, there's that.
What, now it's my fault that people that are completely unrelated to me and that make their own decisions are working on project A instead of project B which you tend to prefer? How sad is your world, how filled with bile must you be that your pet project is not my pet project, or Friendica/Diaspora/Red developers' pet project!
Go out, talk, explain, reach out and convince people it's worthwhile to invest their time and effort in your idea. Heck, convince me that's worthwhile and that it will get people off of Facebook sooner than in a decade, and I might start helping you out!
Hint: blaming me for your own problems with communication and having a fit over other people taking different paths than yours is not the perfect strategy for that.
Ever thought that might somehow be related to how you go about introducing people to your ideas, maybe?

Well, "criticism" maybe, but then again should you be busy building your perfect solution from ground up, instead of criticising other people's temporary solutions today? ;)
Ah, yes. There we are. :)
There will always be different approaches to such things. Sometimes it *does* make sense to wait for the perfect solution; sometimes it *does* make sense to use harm reduction techniques. The demarcation line is *not* clear and depends heavily on circumstances.
Hence, throwing any incomplete solution out just because it's incomplete, without looking at what a particular threat model is and if maybe, just maybe, it can lower the threat level to people that would be otherwise completely exposed, is disingenuous.

Once somebody does prove that [1] or [2] actually do significantly lower the occurence late of [3], then and *only* then can we have informed debate about them, taking into account tangible and intangible costs of implementing them.

I do have no particular reason to believe you, that's true. And a "because I said so" level of proof for registration address adjacent to Naval Academy does indeed prove nothing. Now, if that's true, probably somebody else dug something up also, right?

Lately I started testing Tox, it's actually usable, voice and video, and file transfers work, it looks neat. Question is (to quote Tolkien, whom I'm sure we all love and cherish):
"Is it secret? Is it safe?"
So we have this:

We also have a brave soul (not me) that attemted writing proper protocol documentation for Tox, and started diving into the code. The docs seem lacking, the only things we've been able to find are:
  Not *that* helpful, but look at the Crypto section in the PDF:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Tox uses crypto_box() from the NaCl crypto library for all the cryptography
in Tox. Unless otherwise noted, all keys refer to keys generated with
crypto_box_keypair(), all encryption is done with crypto_box() and all with crypto_box_open(). For performance purposes the functions to
precompute the shared secret and encrypt and decrypt messages with it are
used extensively in Tox; however, this is not relevant to this document.
The function crypto_box() provides fast public-key authenticated encryption.
For exactly how it works read the NaCl docs.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
So, the brave RFC-writing soul got some questions. Maybe somebody here has access to some answers? Questions being:
 - does the transport layer have encryption? (does the middle layer do that all or...?)
 - where is the documentation of the cryptography?
 - is there any hmac done at all?
 - what is the tox id for a seed with all 0?
 - how does the tox implementation handle different byte alignment?
 - how does the tox implementation handle different byte endiness?
 - how well stressed is the tox implementation? benchmarks?
 - where is the rest of the documentation?  - where can I find a full view of how tox works from bottom to top?

Managing all the encryption and decryption keys you need to keep your data safe across multiple devices, sites, and accounts is theoretically possible, in the same way performing an appendectomy on yourself is theoretically possible. This one guy did it once in Antarctica, why can’t you?
So the question I put to hackers, cryptographers, security experts, programmers, and so on was this: What’s the best option for people who can’t download new software to their machines? The answer was unanimous: nothing. They have no options. They are better off talking in plaintext I was told, “so they don’t have a false sense of security.” Since they don’t have access to better software, I was told, they shouldn’t do anything that might upset the people watching them. But, I explained, these are the activists, organizers, and journalists around the world dealing with governments and corporations and criminals that do real harm, the people in real danger. Then they should buy themselves computers, I was told.
That was it, that was the answer: be rich enough to buy your own computer, or literally drop dead. I told people that wasn’t good enough, got vilified in a few inconsequential Twitter fights, and moved on.
Not long after, I realized where the disconnect was. I went back to the same experts and explained: in the wild, in really dangerous situations — even when people are being hunted by men with guns — when encryption and security fails, no one stops talking. They just hope they don’t get caught.

A journalists friend of mine pointed me to a news flash from AFP - REF: 29578 DVBP 729 GLN20 (4) AFP (295) , if it means something to you - in which they killed someone. Or, if it's not the case, he will be killed soon.
Why? First, they used his full name in the text, and the city where he lives. This is, in essence, like putting a target on his forehead and waiting for snipers, tanks and/or mortars to kill him.
But worse, they used the infamous malware named Skype to contact him. Besides the huge privacy issue related to using something that has been 'accidentaly' deployed in the last Windows Update, it is of public knowledge that Skype is used as a trojan to identify and hunt activists in Syria. The EFF posted about it, kaspersky, posted about it, even the original writer of the tool used inside Skype to deploy the Remote Access Tool has wrote about it along iwth a removal tool.
So, journalists now knows, for month, that it is dangerous to use Skype. It is also dangerous to use closed and proprietary software. A lot of people are telling this for months now and even make propositions to use alternative, free and decentralized systems, because it is the only way to enforce some bits of privacy.

Maybe it's a good moment to add a point to your list of snakeoil tell-tales:
 - "does not have decent documentation of protocols/mode of operation
    available"
As Tox shows (as if it needed to be shown...), source code is not enough, by far. Had the protocol been documented, we would already have a Python implementation, probably, which would solve the "oh crap, C" problem.
That's true.

 - written in C, and the code is "TFC" as defined in my mail in another

 - no good protocol documentation, so no way to to easily:
   - write other implementations;
   - assess the quality of the protocol.
Apart from these, there are the questions I brought up earlier, which might or might not translate to more serious problems.
For the time being I'm going to use Tox for not-mission-critical stuff and testing, and will suggest it to Skype users wanting to talk to me. I will not advocate its use as a security tool.

Exactly. And remember that mainstream public and politicians see Teh Intertubes as "something completely different", a "virtual reality" in which laws and regulations do not apply. This includes any local constitution.
Example: if you had people on post offices opening and reading all mail, people would revolt; you already have people reading your e-mail, and the public goes "that's bad, but meh".
People don't see Internet as a tool, which it is. They see it as a new "domain", new "frontier", in which laws must only be created and human rights protections do not apply.
That's why I find any "Internet Bills of Rights" as counter-productive. They promulgate this divided vision and while some might to some extent solve part of the problems with the Internet, come new communications technology and we have the very same problem.
Instead of "Internet Bills of Rights" we need to make people and politicians understand that *the* Bill of Rights already pertains to the Internet.
But I digress.
tl;dr politicians and the general public don't see the anonymity thing the way you do, the Internet is this scary place full of trolls and "cyberhackers" that can take down the electric grid on a whim, and the only thing that can stop them is identifying every connection.

In order for the cards to work and for the phones’ communications to be secure, Gemalto also needs to provide the mobile company with a file containing the encryption keys for each of the new SIM cards.

The document noted that many SIM card manufacturers transferred the encryption keys to wireless network providers “by email or FTP with simple encryption methods that can be broken … or occasionally with no encryption at all.” To get bulk access to encryption keys, all the NSA or GCHQ needed to do was intercept emails or file transfers as they were sent over the Internet — something both agencies already do millions of times per day. A footnote in the 2010 document observed that the use of “strong encryption products … is becoming increasingly common” in transferring the keys.

- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Tox uses crypto_box() from the NaCl crypto library for all the cryptography
in Tox. Unless otherwise noted, all keys refer to keys generated with
crypto_box_keypair(), all encryption is done with crypto_box() and all with crypto_box_open(). For performance purposes the functions to
precompute the shared secret and encrypt and decrypt messages with it are
used extensively in Tox; however, this is not relevant to this document.
The function crypto_box() provides fast public-key authenticated encryption.
For exactly how it works read the NaCl docs.

A journalists friend of mine pointed me to a news flash from AFP - REF: 29578 DVBP 729 GLN20 (4) AFP (295) , if it means something to you - in which they killed someone. Or, if it's not the case, he will be killed soon.
Why? First, they used his full name in the text, and the city where he lives. This is, in essence, like putting a target on his forehead and waiting for snipers, tanks and/or mortars to kill him.
But worse, they used the infamous malware named Skype to contact him. Besides the huge privacy issue related to using something that has been 'accidentaly' deployed in the last Windows Update, it is of public knowledge that Skype is used as a trojan to identify and hunt activists in Syria. The EFF posted about it, kaspersky, posted about it, even the original writer of the tool used inside Skype to deploy the Remote Access Tool has wrote about it along iwth a removal tool.
So, journalists now knows, for month, that it is dangerous to use Skype. It is also dangerous to use closed and proprietary software. A lot of people are telling this for months now and even make propositions to use alternative, free and decentralized systems, because it is the only way to enforce some bits of privacy.

Exactly. And remember that mainstream public and politicians see Teh Intertubes as "something completely different", a "virtual reality" in which laws and regulations do not apply. This includes any local constitution.
Example: if you had people on post offices opening and reading all mail, people would revolt; you already have people reading your e-mail, and the public goes "that's bad, but meh".
People don't see Internet as a tool, which it is. They see it as a new "domain", new "frontier", in which laws must only be created and human rights protections do not apply.
That's why I find any "Internet Bills of Rights" as counter-productive. They promulgate this divided vision and while some might to some extent solve part of the problems with the Internet, come new communications technology and we have the very same problem.
Instead of "Internet Bills of Rights" we need to make people and politicians understand that *the* Bill of Rights already pertains to the Internet.
But I digress.
tl;dr politicians and the general public don't see the anonymity thing the way you do, the Internet is this scary place full of trolls and "cyberhackers" that can take down the electric grid on a whim, and the only thing that can stop them is identifying every connection.

In order for the cards to work and for the phones’ communications to be secure, Gemalto also needs to provide the mobile company with a file containing the encryption keys for each of the new SIM cards. These master key files could be shipped via FedEx, DHL, UPS or another snail mail provider. More commonly, they could be sent via email or through File Transfer Protocol, FTP, a method of sending files over the Internet.

The document noted that many SIM card manufacturers transferred the encryption keys to wireless network providers “by email or FTP with simple encryption methods that can be broken … or occasionally with no encryption at all.” To get bulk access to encryption keys, all the NSA or GCHQ needed to do was intercept emails or file transfers as they were sent over the Internet — something both agencies already do millions of times per day. A footnote in the 2010 document observed that the use of “strong encryption products … is becoming increasingly common” in transferring the keys.

We also have a brave soul (not me) that attemted writing proper protocol documentation for Tox, and started diving into the code. The docs seem lacking, the only things we've been able to find are:
  Not *that* helpful, but look at the Crypto section in the PDF:
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Tox uses crypto_box() from the NaCl crypto library for all the cryptography
in Tox. Unless otherwise noted, all keys refer to keys generated with
crypto_box_keypair(), all encryption is done with crypto_box() and all with crypto_box_open(). For performance purposes the functions to
precompute the shared secret and encrypt and decrypt messages with it are
used extensively in Tox; however, this is not relevant to this document.
The function crypto_box() provides fast public-key authenticated encryption.
For exactly how it works read the NaCl docs.

So, the brave RFC-writing soul got some questions. Maybe somebody here has access to some answers? Questions being:
 - does the transport layer have encryption? (does the middle layer do that all or...?)
 - where is the documentation of the cryptography?
 - is there any hmac done at all?
 - what is the tox id for a seed with all 0?
 - how does the tox implementation handle different byte alignment?

So, that's not going to change, IMHO. There are several developers and I don't think there was any ascribing of copyrights to any legal or physical person, so changin a license *from* GPL is not entirely straightforward.
I ticked this one as "AOK".
Still, you don't have to use it. As in, I use a desktop client, not going to be using it on my mobile anyway. It doesn't *require* smartphone use, just like e-mail does not *require* a smartphone e-mail app (if you use one, well, that's your choice).
inb4 "e-mail is not safe" -- puh-lease, that was just a way to illustrate a "AOK" for here too.
ACK. So, the PDF I linked to goes a *bit* further (just a wee bit). Go have a look at the "Crypto" section:
So, at least not a "we hold your keys -- FOR SAFETY!!1!" kind of snakeooil. Half of an "AOK" from me here.
True. One has to consider their own threat model and assess if Tox is the answer. Tox does *not* provide anonymity, it at least *tries* to provide OTR-
like features (encryption, integrity, etc.).
Indeed. So again, half an "AOK".
I like the logo. "AOK" from me, especially taken into account they're not reimplementing the wheel but using NaCL instead.
Well, yes, and my beef with Tox is also that the private keys do not require a passpharse to unlock. So that's a no-no in my book.
Still, this doesn't look like snakeoil; rather like a good idea with not-so-
stellar execution, which *might* get better.
Am I missing anything?
Could we have a *separate* thread for it? I'm really interested in having a more in-depth discussion of Tox and this could potentially hi-jack this thread. Much obliged.

So there's a huge difference in (perceived? apparent? true?) intentions.
It's 7 pages, hardly a "white paper", and the Crypto section is about 6 lines. It's a stub, but it does contain *some* info.
Yeah, and I stand by my "still better than Skype, and no intentional nastiness so far found". ;)
Yes. But now we're discussing the proto and the implementation, so I assume we moved forward from the "is it snakeoil" question. At least I hope so.

I'll take the seatbelts, though. I'm fine with making the attacker spend a bit more time and resources if they want to get me. There are no bulletproof solutions anyway.
And the point here is... what exactly? "Don't use encryption, because it *might* be broken one day?"

Answer B:
Can you please direct me towards any software that in your opinion does not have a problem with the "host security" part? A single example of any program, say any communication program, like IM, VoIP, e-mail client, etc, installable on a chosen operating system.
Answer C (I think I'll go with this one):
On a more serious vein, I see I'm dealing with a view that security is binary. That one can only be safe in a meaningful sence, when one has three laptops in a particular setup on their desk.
Problem is, people DIE, NOW, because they use Skype. Not because they misjudged a particular way software A uses crypto primitive B or some such, but because they are using an inherently fucked up, security wise, software to Those people do not have the privilege of having a desk with 3 laptops, they often don't even have damn ADMIN RIGHTS on their laptop. Giving them a tool that works on their (insecure, I agree!!) platforms and yet LOWERS their exposure actually can save lives.

Managing all the encryption and decryption keys you need to keep your data safe across multiple devices, sites, and accounts is theoretically possible, in the same way performing an appendectomy on yourself is theoretically possible. This one guy did it once in Antarctica, why can’t you?
So the question I put to hackers, cryptographers, security experts, programmers, and so on was this: What’s the best option for people who can’t download new software to their machines? The answer was unanimous: nothing. They have no options. They are better off talking in plaintext I was told, “so they don’t have a false sense of security.” Since they don’t have access to better software, I was told, they shouldn’t do anything that might upset the people watching them. But, I explained, these are the activists, organizers, and journalists around the world dealing with governments and corporations and criminals that do real harm, the people in real danger. Then they should buy themselves computers, I was told.
That was it, that was the answer: be rich enough to buy your own computer, or literally drop dead. I told people that wasn’t good enough, got vilified in a few inconsequential Twitter fights, and moved on.
Not long after, I realized where the disconnect was. I went back to the same experts and explained: in the wild, in really dangerous situations — even when people are being hunted by men with guns — when encryption and security fails, no one stops talking. They just hope they don’t get caught.

I accept Tox could warn about some issues better. I accept that desktop security is a joke. But for the love of Dog, that is not what I am asking when I'm asking if Tox is a sane thing to look into.
I'm asking about "do we know of serious security bugs or fuckups in this software". I am asking "can anybody point out any serious, SNAFU-level bugs in the protocol design". And so on.
How about we let stef talk about that himself.

Exactly. And remember that mainstream public and politicians see Teh Intertubes as "something completely different", a "virtual reality" in which laws and regulations do not apply. This includes any local constitution.
Example: if you had people on post offices opening and reading all mail, people would revolt; you already have people reading your e-mail, and the public goes "that's bad, but meh".
People don't see Internet as a tool, which it is. They see it as a new "domain", new "frontier", in which laws must only be created and human rights protections do not apply.
That's why I find any "Internet Bills of Rights" as counter-productive. They promulgate this divided vision and while some might to some extent solve part of the problems with the Internet, come new communications technology and we have the very same problem.
Instead of "Internet Bills of Rights" we need to make people and politicians understand that *the* Bill of Rights already pertains to the Internet.
But I digress.
tl;dr politicians and the general public don't see the anonymity thing the way you do, the Internet is this scary place full of trolls and "cyberhackers" that can take down the electric grid on a whim, and the only thing that can stop them is identifying every connection.

In order for the cards to work and for the phones’ communications to be secure, Gemalto also needs to provide the mobile company with a file containing the encryption keys for each of the new SIM cards. These master key files could be shipped via FedEx, DHL, UPS or another snail mail provider. More commonly, they could be sent via email or through File Transfer Protocol, FTP, a method of sending files over the Internet.

The document noted that many SIM card manufacturers transferred the encryption keys to wireless network providers “by email or FTP with simple encryption methods that can be broken … or occasionally with no encryption at all.” To get bulk access to encryption keys, all the NSA or GCHQ needed to do was intercept emails or file transfers as they were sent over the Internet — something both agencies already do millions of times per day. A footnote in the 2010 document observed that the use of “strong encryption products … is becoming increasingly common” in transferring the keys.

The good old BSD vs. GPL, eh?
The problem with this simplified view is that there are a number of good reasons for copyleft clauses, and many of them were verified during Heartbleed, for instance.
Apparently Facebook used a modified OpenSSL version that was accidentally not vulnerable. Had OpenSSL been licensed under a copyleft license, maybe we wouldn't have Heartbleed at all.
Another reason is a bit broader. In the digital world selling *products* (think: Windows licenses) simply does not work -- the basic operation here is *copying*, trying to make copying hard is not really that smart, is it. We all know how well DRM schemes work, right?
The answer here is to move towards selling *services* -- something that is not easily copy-able. Services like support, deployment, etc. But I guess we all know that already, don't we?
So why exactly does anybody here feel the need to retain the right to close their (or anybody else's, for that matter) software? That doesn't seem like it's required for selling services based on a given software, moreover -- getting it out on a strong copyleft license (like GPLv3 or AGPL) makes it *harder* for large corporations to close that work and out-sell it, and at the same time makes it easier to get all the patches/fixes/etc other people made in particular software.
I see huge practical and economical benefits from using copyleft licenses, and the only argument *against* them is -- as far as I can see -- the "MUH FREEDUMS" aka "I might want to close-off some of my (or somebody else's) I actually feel copyleft licenses give me *more* freedom: I am at least sure nobody can close-off any version of a given (including: mine) program from me.
I have no problem with people advocating BSD/MIT-style licenses as long as we can have a civil discussion about it.

Well, as far as I read it, it's not about *ownership*, but rather *control*. But I guess to some extent you can't have one without the other.

tl;dr we're agreed here
It is not, actually. If you're going for such a strong definition of property, with which I can agree, than let's stay coherent, shall we? The property of yours is the physical device the bits are saved on. The harddrive, DVD, pendrive, whatever. That's your *property*. The encrypted data is just this: encrypted data.
Otherwise you would find yourself in an interesting world where applying encryption to data (both of which are not property, right) magically transforms something immaterial and "not-property" into "property".
That's the world the MPAA's/RIAA's/MAFIAA's are trying to create, look no further than the DMCA, under which even the simplest encryption algorithm (say, ROT13) applied to copyrighted material by the rights holder makes it illegal for others to publish the key (in this case, 13), as it becomes the "property" of the encrypting party. Look it up.
Data, encrypted or not, are not property; however, they can fall under a number of state-granted monopolies, as you have said. Here, I even changed the topic of this e-mail for your convenience.
And in this vein my previous mail has been written -- as far as I understand, the original question was about how encryption *algorithms* (and *not* encrypted data itself) should be handled from the Imaginary Property Law standpoint (so: patents, copyrights, etc).
And I have provided an answer from my perspective in said previous mail.

I don't see a Diaspora/The Federation support, for My problem with this is two-fold:
1. It might allow abuse, esp. MITM attacks. If Keybase becomes a /de facto/ standard of acquiring keys, it seems trivial to me for them to replace a valued target's key with something a LEA would provide.
2. It still promotes the closed, walled-gardens. Diaspora or GNU Social support would not be that hard to implement.

@_subject: SilentCircle fail 
While exploring my recently purchased BlackPhone, I discovered that the
messaging application contains a serious memory corruption vulnerability
that can be triggered remotely by an attacker.  If exploited
successfully, this flaw could be used to gain remote arbitrary code
execution on the target's handset. The code run by the attacker will
have the privileges of the messaging application, which is a standard
Android application with some additional privileges. Specifically, it is
possible to:
    decrypt messages / commandeer SilentCircle account
    gather location information
    read contacts
    write to external storage
    run additional code of the attacker's choosing (such as a privilege
escalation exploit aimed at gaining root or kernel-mode access, thus
taking complete control of the phone)
The only knowledge required by the attacker is the target's Silent
Circle ID or phone number - the target does not need to be lured in to
contacting the attacker (although the flaw is exploitable in this
scenario as well).
By resetting the jctx->msg->msgType field with the "dh2" attribute at
the end of the message, a type confusion vulnerability will occur where
the seq fields supplied in the "data" message will be incorrectly
interpreted as the pk field - a raw memory pointer. (In this case, the
low two bytes have been set to 0x8080.) Note that by utilizing messages
other than "data", we could arbitrarily modify the entire pointer (and
the pkLen field, indicating how much data pk points to). Assuming that
we are at the correct phase of protocol negotiation, sending this
message results in the following crash:

 They will get banned, and will get banned as "terrorist devices". You will
 hear arguments that, for example, they are able to help "terrorists" plant
 explosives or create havoc and are very hard to take down once airborne.
 The funny part is: we had flying drones in the form of RC planes and copters
 for years upon years and nobody thought about banning them. Moreover, these
 would be much better-suited for the supposed "terrorists", as they are bigger
 and more powerful — able to carry a bigger amount of explosives, on a longer

2. tl;dr it is statistically impossible to have profiling (based, say, on dragnet surveillance) work well on large populations -- too many false positives and false negatives.
1. & 2. can be safely assumed to be known for the NSA and powers that are. So obviously anti-terrorism is not the real aim of all this. What is?

Suppose that NSA’s system is really, really, really good, really,
really good, with an accuracy rate of .90, and a misidentification
rate of .00001, which means that only 3,000 innocent people are
misidentified as terrorists. With these suppositions, then the
probability that people are terrorists given that NSA’s system of
surveillance identifies them as terrorists is only p=0.2308, which is
far from one and well below flipping a coin. NSA’s domestic monitoring
of everyone’s email and phone calls is useless for finding terrorists.
NSA knows this. Bayes’ Theorem is elementary common knowledge.
Also, mass surveillance of the entire population is logically
plausible if NSA’s domestic spying is not looking for terrorists, but
looking for something else, something that is not so rare as
terrorists. For example, the May 19 Fox News opinion poll of 900
registered voters found that 30% dislike the Bush administration so
much they want him impeached. If NSA were monitoring email and phone
calls to identify pro-impeachment people, and if the accuracy rate
were .90 and the error rate were .01, then the probability that people
are pro-impeachment given that NSA surveillance system identified them
as such, would be p=.98, which is coming close to certainty (p_1.00).

The good old BSD vs. GPL, eh?
The problem with this simplified view is that there are a number of good reasons for copyleft clauses, and many of them were verified during Heartbleed, for instance.
Apparently Facebook used a modified OpenSSL version that was accidentally not vulnerable. Had OpenSSL been licensed under a copyleft license, maybe we wouldn't have Heartbleed at all.
Another reason is a bit broader. In the digital world selling *products* (think: Windows licenses) simply does not work -- the basic operation here is *copying*, trying to make copying hard is not really that smart, is it. We all know how well DRM schemes work, right?
The answer here is to move towards selling *services* -- something that is not easily copy-able. Services like support, deployment, etc. But I guess we all know that already, don't we?
So why exactly does anybody here feel the need to retain the right to close their (or anybody else's, for that matter) software? That doesn't seem like it's required for selling services based on a given software, moreover -- getting it out on a strong copyleft license (like GPLv3 or AGPL) makes it *harder* for large corporations to close that work and out-sell it, and at the same time makes it easier to get all the patches/fixes/etc other people made in particular software.
I see huge practical and economical benefits from using copyleft licenses, and the only argument *against* them is -- as far as I can see -- the "MUH FREEDUMS" aka "I might want to close-off some of my (or somebody else's) I actually feel copyleft licenses give me *more* freedom: I am at least sure nobody can close-off any version of a given (including: mine) program from me.
I have no problem with people advocating BSD/MIT-style licenses as long as we can have a civil discussion about it.

It is not, actually. If you're going for such a strong definition of property, with which I can agree, than let's stay coherent, shall we? The property of yours is the physical device the bits are saved on. The harddrive, DVD, pendrive, whatever. That's your *property*. The encrypted data is just this: encrypted data.
Otherwise you would find yourself in an interesting world where applying encryption to data (both of which are not property, right) magically transforms something immaterial and "not-property" into "property".
That's the world the MPAA's/RIAA's/MAFIAA's are trying to create, look no further than the DMCA, under which even the simplest encryption algorithm (say, ROT13) applied to copyrighted material by the rights holder makes it illegal for others to publish the key (in this case, 13), as it becomes the "property" of the encrypting party. Look it up.
Data, encrypted or not, are not property; however, they can fall under a number of state-granted monopolies, as you have said. Here, I even changed the topic of this e-mail for your convenience.
And in this vein my previous mail has been written -- as far as I understand, the original question was about how encryption *algorithms* (and *not* encrypted data itself) should be handled from the Imaginary Property Law standpoint (so: patents, copyrights, etc).
And I have provided an answer from my perspective in said previous mail.

I keep hearing more and more about keybase, and I have a problem with it. It's a centralised service, owned and controlled by a single entity; moreover, the keys are tied to online identities controlled by corporate third parties (Twitter, Facebook, et al). I don't see a Diaspora/The Federation support, for My problem with this is two-fold:
1. It might allow abuse, esp. MITM attacks. If Keybase becomes a /de facto/ standard of acquiring keys, it seems trivial to me for them to replace a valued target's key with something a LEA would provide.
2. It still promotes the closed, walled-gardens. Diaspora or GNU Social support would not be that hard to implement.

@_subject: SilentCircle fail 
While exploring my recently purchased BlackPhone, I discovered that the
messaging application contains a serious memory corruption vulnerability
that can be triggered remotely by an attacker.  If exploited
successfully, this flaw could be used to gain remote arbitrary code
execution on the target's handset. The code run by the attacker will
have the privileges of the messaging application, which is a standard
Android application with some additional privileges. Specifically, it is
possible to:
    decrypt messages / commandeer SilentCircle account
    gather location information
    read contacts
    write to external storage
    run additional code of the attacker's choosing (such as a privilege
escalation exploit aimed at gaining root or kernel-mode access, thus
taking complete control of the phone)
The only knowledge required by the attacker is the target's Silent
Circle ID or phone number - the target does not need to be lured in to
contacting the attacker (although the flaw is exploitable in this
scenario as well).
By resetting the jctx->msg->msgType field with the "dh2" attribute at
the end of the message, a type confusion vulnerability will occur where
the seq fields supplied in the "data" message will be incorrectly
interpreted as the pk field - a raw memory pointer. (In this case, the
low two bytes have been set to 0x8080.) Note that by utilizing messages
other than "data", we could arbitrarily modify the entire pointer (and
the pkLen field, indicating how much data pk points to). Assuming that
we are at the correct phase of protocol negotiation, sending this
message results in the following crash:

 They will get banned, and will get banned as "terrorist devices". You will

 The funny part is: we had flying drones in the form of RC planes and copters

 would be much better-suited for the supposed "terrorists", as they are bigger

1. tl;dr NSA-style spying doesn't really help that much in "anti-terrorism"

1. & 2. can be safely assumed to be known for the NSA and powers that are. So obviously anti-terrorism is not the real aim of all this. What is?

Suppose that NSA’s system is really, really, really good, really,
really good, with an accuracy rate of .90, and a misidentification
rate of .00001, which means that only 3,000 innocent people are
misidentified as terrorists. With these suppositions, then the
probability that people are terrorists given that NSA’s system of
surveillance identifies them as terrorists is only p=0.2308, which is
far from one and well below flipping a coin. NSA’s domestic monitoring
of everyone’s email and phone calls is useless for finding terrorists.
NSA knows this. Bayes’ Theorem is elementary common knowledge.
Also, mass surveillance of the entire population is logically
plausible if NSA’s domestic spying is not looking for terrorists, but
looking for something else, something that is not so rare as
terrorists. For example, the May 19 Fox News opinion poll of 900
registered voters found that 30% dislike the Bush administration so
much they want him impeached. If NSA were monitoring email and phone
calls to identify pro-impeachment people, and if the accuracy rate
were .90 and the error rate were .01, then the probability that people
are pro-impeachment given that NSA surveillance system identified them
as such, would be p=.98, which is coming close to certainty (p_1.00).

The good old BSD vs. GPL, eh?
The problem with this simplified view is that there are a number of good reasons for copyleft clauses, and many of them were verified during Heartbleed, for instance.
Apparently Facebook used a modified OpenSSL version that was accidentally not vulnerable. Had OpenSSL been licensed under a copyleft license, maybe we wouldn't have Heartbleed at all.
Another reason is a bit broader. In the digital world selling *products* (think: Windows licenses) simply does not work -- the basic operation here is *copying*, trying to make copying hard is not really that smart, is it. We all know how well DRM schemes work, right?
The answer here is to move towards selling *services* -- something that is not easily copy-able. Services like support, deployment, etc. But I guess we all know that already, don't we?
So why exactly does anybody here feel the need to retain the right to close their (or anybody else's, for that matter) software? That doesn't seem like it's required for selling services based on a given software, moreover -- getting it out on a strong copyleft license (like GPLv3 or AGPL) makes it *harder* for large corporations to close that work and out-sell it, and at the same time makes it easier to get all the patches/fixes/etc other people made in particular software.
I see huge practical and economical benefits from using copyleft licenses, and the only argument *against* them is -- as far as I can see -- the "MUH FREEDUMS" aka "I might want to close-off some of my (or somebody else's) I actually feel copyleft licenses give me *more* freedom: I am at least sure nobody can close-off any version of a given (including: mine) program from me.
I have no problem with people advocating BSD/MIT-style licenses as long as we can have a civil discussion about it.

It is not, actually. If you're going for such a strong definition of property, with which I can agree, than let's stay coherent, shall we? The property of yours is the physical device the bits are saved on. The harddrive, DVD, pendrive, whatever. That's your *property*. The encrypted data is just this: encrypted data.
Otherwise you would find yourself in an interesting world where applying encryption to data (both of which are not property, right) magically transforms something immaterial and "not-property" into "property".
That's the world the MPAA's/RIAA's/MAFIAA's are trying to create, look no further than the DMCA, under which even the simplest encryption algorithm (say, ROT13) applied to copyrighted material by the rights holder makes it illegal for others to publish the key (in this case, 13), as it becomes the "property" of the encrypting party. Look it up.
Data, encrypted or not, are not property; however, they can fall under a number of state-granted monopolies, as you have said. Here, I even changed the topic of this e-mail for your convenience.
And in this vein my previous mail has been written -- as far as I understand, the original question was about how encryption *algorithms* (and *not* encrypted data itself) should be handled from the Imaginary Property Law standpoint (so: patents, copyrights, etc).
And I have provided an answer from my perspective in said previous mail.

I keep hearing more and more about keybase, and I have a problem with it. It's a centralised service, owned and controlled by a single entity; moreover, the keys are tied to online identities controlled by corporate third parties (Twitter, Facebook, et al). I don't see a Diaspora/The Federation support, for My problem with this is two-fold:
1. It might allow abuse, esp. MITM attacks. If Keybase becomes a /de facto/ standard of acquiring keys, it seems trivial to me for them to replace a valued target's key with something a LEA would provide.
2. It still promotes the closed, walled-gardens. Diaspora or GNU Social support would not be that hard to implement.

@_subject: SilentCircle fail 
While exploring my recently purchased BlackPhone, I discovered that the
messaging application contains a serious memory corruption vulnerability
that can be triggered remotely by an attacker.  If exploited
successfully, this flaw could be used to gain remote arbitrary code
execution on the target's handset. The code run by the attacker will
have the privileges of the messaging application, which is a standard
Android application with some additional privileges. Specifically, it is
possible to:
    decrypt messages / commandeer SilentCircle account
    gather location information
    read contacts
    write to external storage
    run additional code of the attacker's choosing (such as a privilege
escalation exploit aimed at gaining root or kernel-mode access, thus
taking complete control of the phone)
The only knowledge required by the attacker is the target's Silent
Circle ID or phone number - the target does not need to be lured in to
contacting the attacker (although the flaw is exploitable in this
scenario as well).
By resetting the jctx->msg->msgType field with the "dh2" attribute at
the end of the message, a type confusion vulnerability will occur where
the seq fields supplied in the "data" message will be incorrectly
interpreted as the pk field - a raw memory pointer. (In this case, the
low two bytes have been set to 0x8080.) Note that by utilizing messages
other than "data", we could arbitrarily modify the entire pointer (and
the pkLen field, indicating how much data pk points to). Assuming that
we are at the correct phase of protocol negotiation, sending this
message results in the following crash:

 They will get banned, and will get banned as "terrorist devices". You will
 hear arguments that, for example, they are able to help "terrorists" plant
 explosives or create havoc and are very hard to take down once airborne.
 The funny part is: we had flying drones in the form of RC planes and copters
 for years upon years and nobody thought about banning them. Moreover, these
 would be much better-suited for the supposed "terrorists", as they are bigger
 and more powerful — able to carry a bigger amount of explosives, on a longer
 distance, faster and therefore harder to intercept."

1. tl;dr NSA-style spying doesn't really help that much in "anti-terrorism"
2. tl;dr it is statistically impossible to have profiling (based, say, on dragnet surveillance) work well on large populations -- too many false positives and false negatives.
1. & 2. can be safely assumed to be known for the NSA and powers that are. So obviously anti-terrorism is not the real aim of all this. What is?
Shall we quote 2.?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Suppose that NSA’s system is really, really, really good, really,
really good, with an accuracy rate of .90, and a misidentification
rate of .00001, which means that only 3,000 innocent people are
misidentified as terrorists. With these suppositions, then the
probability that people are terrorists given that NSA’s system of
surveillance identifies them as terrorists is only p=0.2308, which is
far from one and well below flipping a coin. NSA’s domestic monitoring
of everyone’s email and phone calls is useless for finding terrorists.
NSA knows this. Bayes’ Theorem is elementary common knowledge.
Also, mass surveillance of the entire population is logically
plausible if NSA’s domestic spying is not looking for terrorists, but
looking for something else, something that is not so rare as
terrorists. For example, the May 19 Fox News opinion poll of 900
registered voters found that 30% dislike the Bush administration so
much they want him impeached. If NSA were monitoring email and phone
calls to identify pro-impeachment people, and if the accuracy rate
were .90 and the error rate were .01, then the probability that people
are pro-impeachment given that NSA surveillance system identified them
as such, would be p=.98, which is coming close to certainty (p_1.00).

Well, provide any funds, at all, at least, then.
Glad we can agree here.
I would argue "that's not an easy answer". Depends on many variables, and boils down to: are we hacking the system to have our way, or are we being co-
opted by the system. It's never black or white, so it depends on a given And yet he helped arm the Black Panthers.
Of course.
Of course. Does it follow that the state necessarily will succeed in co-opting such projects? I would argue "no". The outcome is not so clear, and I do find the fact that these projects *are* funded and can continue to deliver the great tools they do deliver a rather positive one.
Until I see evidence of co-option (like backdoors in code or binaries, etc), I will continue to be cautiously optimistic here.
The question is not if the state can use such a tactic, but if those projects will bow down to such a tactic. Again, until I see such a situation, I will consider such funding an option, as long as there are no otehr options.
I prefer good FLOSS that is funded by the state money than no FLOSS at all.
I'm sure you, my friend, have a steady cashflow that is in no way connected to blood money, and I congratulate you on that. Not all of us are so fortunate. As long as these privacy activists do not bow down and bend over -- and I have not seen evidence of that as far as several projects discussed on this list are concerned -- I don't see a huge problem.
It *would* be better to have them funded in some other way, but it's still better to have them funded at all.
Cool. So let me ask you this: if you can either have (in large part) gov't-
funded FLOSS privacy-protecting projects, or next to none of such projects, what do you choose?

So Polish law is interesting here: basically, one can make a picture without consent of people visible on the picture as long as they are not the apparent topic of the picture.
I.e. you can have a picture of a public space with some random tourists, and you can publish that on the Internet without asking these tourists for On the other hand, if you make a picture of a particular person or persons, even in a public setting, where they are apparently the topic of the picture, it's illegal without their consent.
It's obviously a bit of a blurred line, but I think it's a much better way of handling this than "if you're in a public space, you have no expectation of privacy" bullshit. Privacy is a bit more complicated than that.

Of course.
Of course. Does it follow that the state necessarily will succeed in co-opting such projects? I would argue "no". The outcome is not so clear, and I do find the fact that these projects *are* funded and can continue to deliver the great tools they do deliver a rather positive one.
Until I see evidence of co-option (like backdoors in code or binaries, etc), I will continue to be cautiously optimistic here.
The question is not if the state can use such a tactic, but if those projects will bow down to such a tactic. Again, until I see such a situation, I will consider such funding an option, as long as there are no otehr options.
I prefer good FLOSS that is funded by the state money than no FLOSS at all.
I'm sure you, my friend, have a steady cashflow that is in no way connected to blood money, and I congratulate you on that. Not all of us are so fortunate. As long as these privacy activists do not bow down and bend over -- and I have not seen evidence of that as far as several projects discussed on this list are concerned -- I don't see a huge problem.
It *would* be better to have them funded in some other way, but it's still better to have them funded at all.
Cool. So let me ask you this: if you can either have (in large part) gov't-
funded FLOSS privacy-protecting projects, or next to none of such projects, what do you choose?

Hold on there. These are two different beasts. DNT is "please don't track me" and of course it won't work. Adblock is "I am not letting this through, deal with it" and has much more merit and chances of actually stopping stuff from getting to you.
There might, or might not, be hackers among us who are trying to hack on policy level. But those hackers, if they indeed are following (or maybe even taking part in) the discussions here, might not want to come out with such information, as the level of hostility towards any persons or organisations that can be painted as "working with The Man" or "taking the Man's money" is too damn high™.
In other words, FUD spread by "the Man" and the disinformation campaign, sowing dissent, creating hostility and distrust within the community, and in general the divide and conquer approach work wonders.
I consider these many levels more problematic than the fact that Project A takes government money to write FLOSS.

It's both. Have you tried using Enigmail or Mailvelope? Oh man. Enigmail on Windoze last time I checked couldn't handle passwords with non-ASCII chars (I think this is *still true*). Mailvelope requires you to explicitly select the keys you want to encrypt your message with instead of at least pre-filling the list with addressees of the e-mail.
The most usable PGP/GPG interface I've seen (and am still using, even though there are other problems with the broader setup) is KMail+KGPG. And it could *still* be much more convenient.
Simple thing that any such interface could do to make key exchange/verification much easier and manageable to 90% of people is letting you use key fingerprints instead of e-mails in the To/CC fields:
And yes, motivation is a large, large issue too! But usability of most of the tools is dismal.

DuckDuckGo to the rescue. Apparently there is no way to physically doctor an SD card to become read-only once and for all, but here's *something* at least:
It's not good enough (as anybody who has a device like that can make the card readable again), but it's an interesting hack nonetheless.

The most usable PGP/GPG interface I've seen (and am still using, even though there are other problems with the broader setup) is KMail+KGPG. And it could *still* be much more convenient.
Simple thing that any such interface could do to make key exchange/verification much easier and manageable to 90% of people is letting you use key fingerprints instead of e-mails in the To/CC fields:

My point was, rather, that ultimately this:

...often ends up being this:
"bypassing the *current* state (...) and building the kind of society we want
 without the *current* governments' permission, so that we can become the
 government that others need permission of"
One way or the other we end up with a "state" or some other state-like organisation. There will be rulers, and there will be ruled.
But we can either choose to take what we can from what seems to be a set of good ideas (separation of powers, checks and balances, etc) and build upon them or try implementing them in a more functional way, or... go the "ignore it altogether" route, end up reinventing the wheel, and arriving at a not-all-
that-functional variation of it.

Hi all,
so, as we all know, Big Brothers tend to use keypress timings to identify users on the Net. This of course leads to a question: are there ways to introduce randomness in keypress timings?
I imagine a Linux kernel module that could be doing this, for instance. Anybody heard of anything like this?
There are things like All is Text:

Of course I can defend my culture. But there are two crucial questions here:
 - from what can I defend my culture;
 - with what means can I defend my culture.
Can I defend my culture verbally from somebody talking shit about it? Sure.
Can I defend my culture with force from an armed aggressor? Sure.
Can I "defend my culture" from people who had to leave their homes due to war?
How would I even "defend my culture" in such a scenario? Deport them all for certain death? Imprison them?..
Asking the "can one defend their culture" question without asking the other two is really underhanded and disingenuous. It's akin to asking "can one defend themselves" in the context of a Police officer killing an unarmed
13-year-old kid with a watergun.
Are we really to say that our culture is so weak, so vulnerable, so hard to defend that an influx of immigrants that amounts to 0,03% (yes, three-

Very much so. Here's a helpful infographic version:
One thing to note is that one important way we are being intellectually castrated is by being led to radicalizing our positions -- by the filter bubble, by keeping more and more to like-minded people on social media, by assuming "the other side" (whichever that might be in any given circumstances) is "inherently evil", and by assuming off the bat what the "other side" in a given discussion has to say. Without listening, without thinking.
This, in turn, makes it impossible to find middle ground and to *actually* understand the world, and to *actually* work to improve it.
Look at the US vs. Russia debate. Why the fuck does it have to be "vs."? Why the fuck almost every single "lefty" person that I talk to and pass on my concerns about what Putin (yes, personally that guy; I have no beef with Russians as a people) assumes that at the same time I'm saying I'm okay with US internal or international policies? Why if I criticize actions of the Russian government I am immediately assumed to be defending actions of the US?
And, on the other hand, why do people that have (rightful) grievances with US policies fail to even *consider* that maybe, just maybe, things in Russia aren't all that great and that Putin is not entirely the victim here?
They are both fucked up, in many *different* (systemic racism in the US; systemic homophobia in Russia), and several *similar* ways (oligarchy running things). And yet they are able to play us, because predominantly we simply cannot see the bigger picture and cannot seem to understand *anything* more complicated than the simplified beyond belief "USA BAD RUSSIA GOOD" (or the other way around) worldview.
It sickens me.

Hi Carol,
Thanks for highlighting this. Its a  draft National Encryption Policy
and public comments are invited by October 16, 2015. Comments are to be
emailed to Mr A,S.A. Krishnan,  akrishnan
The key highlights of the policy are :
1. A stipulation that businesses and citizens are to maintain plain text
(unencrypted) copies of encrypted content for a period of 90 days, to be
made available to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) when so directed under
2. Vendors of encryption products are required to register their
products with the Government as a pre-condition to conducting business
in India. They are also expected to re-register their products with
every update. This requirement is not limited to vendors of dedicated
encryption products, and seemingly includes even products that use
encryption in the course of providing a larger service such as messaging
or e-commerce. (Service  Providers located  within  and
outside  India, using  Encryption  technology  for providing any type of
 services in India must enter  into an agreement with the Government
for providing such  services in India).
3. Encryption   algorithms   and key   sizes shall be prescribed
by   the Government through Notifications from time to time.

Some things would appear easy. Like *not* removing the "delete history after X days" setting. Now in Firefox you can only either have history, or not have it at all.

Of course I can defend my culture. But there are two crucial questions here:
 - from what can I defend my culture;
 - with what means can I defend my culture.
Can I defend my culture verbally from somebody talking shit about it? Sure.
Can I defend my culture with force from an armed aggressor? Sure.
Can I "defend my culture" from people who had to leave their homes due to war?
How would I even "defend my culture" in such a scenario? Deport them all for certain death? Imprison them?..
Asking the "can one defend their culture" question without asking the other two is really underhanded and disingenuous. It's akin to asking "can one defend themselves" in the context of a Police officer killing an unarmed
13-year-old kid with a watergun.
Are we really to say that our culture is so weak, so vulnerable, so hard to defend that an influx of immigrants that amounts to 0,03% (yes, three-

Very much so. Here's a helpful infographic version:
One thing to note is that one important way we are being intellectually castrated is by being led to radicalizing our positions -- by the filter bubble, by keeping more and more to like-minded people on social media, by assuming "the other side" (whichever that might be in any given circumstances) is "inherently evil", and by assuming off the bat what the "other side" in a given discussion has to say. Without listening, without thinking.
This, in turn, makes it impossible to find middle ground and to *actually* understand the world, and to *actually* work to improve it.
Look at the US vs. Russia debate. Why the fuck does it have to be "vs."? Why the fuck almost every single "lefty" person that I talk to and pass on my concerns about what Putin (yes, personally that guy; I have no beef with Russians as a people) assumes that at the same time I'm saying I'm okay with US internal or international policies? Why if I criticize actions of the Russian government I am immediately assumed to be defending actions of the US?
And, on the other hand, why do people that have (rightful) grievances with US policies fail to even *consider* that maybe, just maybe, things in Russia aren't all that great and that Putin is not entirely the victim here?
They are both fucked up, in many *different* (systemic racism in the US; systemic homophobia in Russia), and several *similar* ways (oligarchy running things). And yet they are able to play us, because predominantly we simply cannot see the bigger picture and cannot seem to understand *anything* more complicated than the simplified beyond belief "USA BAD RUSSIA GOOD" (or the other way around) worldview.
It sickens me.

Hi Carol,
Thanks for highlighting this. Its a  draft National Encryption Policy
and public comments are invited by October 16, 2015. Comments are to be
emailed to Mr A,S.A. Krishnan,  akrishnan at deity.gov.in
The key highlights of the policy are :
1. A stipulation that businesses and citizens are to maintain plain text
(unencrypted) copies of encrypted content for a period of 90 days, to be
made available to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) when so directed under
2. Vendors of encryption products are required to register their
products with the Government as a pre-condition to conducting business
in India. They are also expected to re-register their products with
every update. This requirement is not limited to vendors of dedicated
encryption products, and seemingly includes even products that use
encryption in the course of providing a larger service such as messaging
or e-commerce. (Service  Providers located  within  and
outside  India, using  Encryption  technology  for providing any type of
 services in India must enter  into an agreement with the Government
for providing such  services in India).
3. Encryption   algorithms   and key   sizes shall be prescribed
by   the Government through Notifications from time to time.

 around $0.08 USD, so you pay your 8 cents to the miners and the network in
 compensation for polluting the blockchain with your 80 bytes of data."

One could argue that using the term "fingerpointing" to refer to potential criticism of Putin's regime, and calling people who do just that "those working the Broadcasting Board of Governors propaganda beat" might be taken as more or less just that, or at least of turning the attention away from what's going on in Russia, but I also might just had a knee-jerk moment. :)

Of course I can defend my culture. But there are two crucial questions here:
 - from what can I defend my culture;
 - with what means can I defend my culture.
Can I defend my culture verbally from somebody talking shit about it? Sure.
Can I defend my culture with force from an armed aggressor? Sure.
Can I "defend my culture" from people who had to leave their homes due to war?
How would I even "defend my culture" in such a scenario? Deport them all for certain death? Imprison them?..
Asking the "can one defend their culture" question without asking the other two is really underhanded and disingenuous. It's akin to asking "can one defend themselves" in the context of a Police officer killing an unarmed
13-year-old kid with a watergun.
Are we really to say that our culture is so weak, so vulnerable, so hard to defend that an influx of immigrants that amounts to 0,03% (yes, three-
hundredths of a percent!)[1] of the whole population of the EU is suddenly a real threat?

Very much so. Here's a helpful infographic version:
One thing to note is that one important way we are being intellectually castrated is by being led to radicalizing our positions -- by the filter bubble, by keeping more and more to like-minded people on social media, by assuming "the other side" (whichever that might be in any given circumstances) is "inherently evil", and by assuming off the bat what the "other side" in a given discussion has to say. Without listening, without thinking.
This, in turn, makes it impossible to find middle ground and to *actually* understand the world, and to *actually* work to improve it.
Look at the US vs. Russia debate. Why the fuck does it have to be "vs."? Why the fuck almost every single "lefty" person that I talk to and pass on my concerns about what Putin (yes, personally that guy; I have no beef with Russians as a people) assumes that at the same time I'm saying I'm okay with US internal or international policies? Why if I criticize actions of the Russian government I am immediately assumed to be defending actions of the US?
And, on the other hand, why do people that have (rightful) grievances with US policies fail to even *consider* that maybe, just maybe, things in Russia aren't all that great and that Putin is not entirely the victim here?
They are both fucked up, in many *different* (systemic racism in the US; systemic homophobia in Russia), and several *similar* ways (oligarchy running things). And yet they are able to play us, because predominantly we simply cannot see the bigger picture and cannot seem to understand *anything* more complicated than the simplified beyond belief "USA BAD RUSSIA GOOD" (or the other way around) worldview.
It sickens me.

Hi Carol,
Thanks for highlighting this. Its a  draft National Encryption Policy
and public comments are invited by October 16, 2015. Comments are to be
emailed to Mr A,S.A. Krishnan,  akrishnan at deity.gov.in
The key highlights of the policy are :
1. A stipulation that businesses and citizens are to maintain plain text
(unencrypted) copies of encrypted content for a period of 90 days, to be
made available to Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) when so directed under
2. Vendors of encryption products are required to register their
products with the Government as a pre-condition to conducting business
in India. They are also expected to re-register their products with
every update. This requirement is not limited to vendors of dedicated
encryption products, and seemingly includes even products that use
encryption in the course of providing a larger service such as messaging
or e-commerce. (Service  Providers located  within  and
outside  India, using  Encryption  technology  for providing any type of
 services in India must enter  into an agreement with the Government
for providing such  services in India).
3. Encryption   algorithms   and key   sizes shall be prescribed
by   the Government through Notifications from time to time.

Hummm, but what if JS is turned off (is anyone using Tor with JS turned on?). Not defending CloudFlare here (not a fan of centralised services like this), just wondering.
In fact, just tested it in the Tor Browser with JS disabled (as it is by default). No traffic was generated upon clicking on images -- only after hitting "submit".
Not much better, but a bit better nonetheless, I guess.

I needed an encrypted back-end link between several servers, so that even if any set of them goes down, encrypted comms keep working between all of the OpenVPN felt more like client-server thingy, more slated towards a star topology. IPsec is node-node (at least in this particular usecase).
But I might be missing something here, so again, comments welcome.

Or, perhaps, we can actually have civil society organisations that (sadly) show signs of being corrupted by the power (over *something*)?
Well, at what point a voluntary organisation stops being voluntary? When they commit their first crime? I am confused about your usage of the word "voluntary" here. Are you not actually looking for "non-criminal"?
If that's your standard for "equating", then I have to ask... Why are you equating civil society to mafia? After all, you just "listed civil society and mafia in the same sentence".
Here it is again, for your distinct viewing pleasure:
That's actually a valid point. Your default answer will be "Teh Gubmint", and in the particular case of IWF, you'd actually be right.
Thing is, does that mean that we have:
 - a civil society organisation
 - that *you agree* has been to some extent corrupted by power they got?
It's a "yes/no" question.
And yet they are a civil society organisation. My point stands: *even* civil society can be corrupted by power. Do you not agree?
Governments are not good in and of themselves. But seeing *everything* that a government touches as evil/bad/criminal/your-word-here is akin to seeing everything that contains mercury (the element) as toxic. If that doesn't ring a bell, let me help you with that:
So basically, yes, I am now calling your anti-Tor bullshit akin to the anti-
vaccine crowd bullshit (or, as I prefer to call them, "pro-disease").
Power bad always, needs to be checked, *regardless* of whether or not it (power) happens to be in the hands of a government, mafia, private sector, civil society, or pixies and unicorns.
Problem is, there are many, many different power structures. Governments are one kind of these. But there are many more, and they emerge on their own, all the time. Looking *only* on governments (and mafia) and missing the broader picture is just plain silly.
Still, sometimes I would love to have your simple "gummint bad, private sector good, remove gummint and the free market will cure cancer" view of the world. One can dream...

Fair enough. Let's work with that. Does that mean that orphans should not take the government's candy? Does that mean that orphans that *do* take that candy are "sellouts" and are to be ostracized or considered akin to government Again, fair enough. Never been a fan of "imposing a plan by force".
So we have a mafioso that became a *victim* of the very mafia he was a (voluntary) member of. Cool.
Okay, let me be more specific. Imagine if you will a situation, in which the mafioso in question does not *know* that the mafia gave out orders to kill him. There was no clear beef between him and the mafia, but some external circumstances cause the capos to decide that this guy has to go.
So the mafioso in question does not *know* that he is going to be killed.
And let's assume he has been killed while he was sleeping. So that he had no chance of realising what's going on.
My question is: does the sheer fact of being killed by the organisation the mafioso was a *voluntary* member of, without him knowing that he's going to be killed, change his "membership status" from voluntary to non-voluntary? :)
We're trying to establish what does it mean to be a "voluntary organisation", and if all victims by definition are not voluntary. You seem to put a lot on that, so I am trying to understand how you use those words.
Cool, so we agreed that Wikipedia is an "involuntary victim" of a civil society organisation. Wonderful!
A-ha! Aims! So we arrive at the dreaded "No True Scotsman". :)
So, what's *your* definition* of "civil society", then?
WorldWide Fund and Greenpeace seem to have "coercive aims", as in: they are trying to influence decisions of other people in a certain way. Sometimes even using intimidation.
Yet many would agree that these are civil society organisations. So:
 - could you define "coercive aims"?  - are Greenpeace and WWF civil society organisations, or not?
Interesting. Could you define "militant society" and perhaps draw the line between the two?
Okay, still needing a definition of "civil society", "coercive aims" and "militant society".
Like Greenpeace and WWF?
Okay. So why use two words for it?
Also, does that make the Internet Watch Foundation "criminal"?
How can I retain your meaning, if I do not understand it? Well, apart from the "shitbag" part, of course.
Thank goodness we were able to get to that conclusion. Eventually.
Well, it actually highlighted the definition problem. So, how do you define:
 - civil society
 - militant society
 - coercive aims
Wait, does your definition of "civil society" *require* an organisation to be a "libertarian voluntarist" one? And what would that mean?
So basically you make up your own meaning of words/phrases and call people names because they use it in a different way, without first explaining your way of using these terms? Uh-huh.
Ah, now we're getting somewhere! So we can have private companies that are Can they be corrupt without government's help?

Before we dive into this rabbit hole, do I understand correctly that above you just agreed that:
1. in and of itself the fact that a project (say, Tor) takes government money, does not *automagically* mean that the project is corrupt/coercive/in bed/etc?
2. that it is *possible* that such a project (not necessarily Tor; some hypothetical project) can have good outcome *despite* taking money from the Because Juan Says So.
Elaborate on the "sort of" please, as I'm afraid I'm gonna be called a "shitbag" soon enough if you don't.
But you do agree it is not the *only* problem?
What about focusing on things that are not as bad as the government, but *not* denying that government is a big problem?
What, in your view, would happen once Teh Gummint is gone, then?
Also, it's cute how you divide the world into statists and yourself. :)
Absofuckinglutely not.
Now now, let's not bundle two distinct things. Nice try, but no bone.
I do hold that encryption systems should be as unbreakable as possible, or perhaps even more.
And at the same time I hold strongly (and have data to back it up) that this will not seriously hinder governments' ability to "enforce laws".
That's exactly why I call LEA's "argument" of "we need backdoors because HURDURRISTS" bullshit. No, no they don't. They have more than ample resources and means to do whatever it is they're doing without breaking encryption.

And every person in power will get more chances to get their "hit", whatever that might be, than a person without that power.

Fair enough. Let's work with that. Does that mean that orphans should not take the government's candy? Does that mean that orphans that *do* take that candy are "sellouts" and are to be ostracized or considered akin to government Again, fair enough. Never been a fan of "imposing a plan by force".
So we have a mafioso that became a *victim* of the very mafia he was a (voluntary) member of. Cool.
Okay, let me be more specific. Imagine if you will a situation, in which the mafioso in question does not *know* that the mafia gave out orders to kill him. There was no clear beef between him and the mafia, but some external circumstances cause the capos to decide that this guy has to go.
So the mafioso in question does not *know* that he is going to be killed.
And let's assume he has been killed while he was sleeping. So that he had no chance of realising what's going on.
My question is: does the sheer fact of being killed by the organisation the mafioso was a *voluntary* member of, without him knowing that he's going to be killed, change his "membership status" from voluntary to non-voluntary? :)
We're trying to establish what does it mean to be a "voluntary organisation", and if all victims by definition are not voluntary. You seem to put a lot on that, so I am trying to understand how you use those words.
Cool, so we agreed that Wikipedia is an "involuntary victim" of a civil society organisation. Wonderful!
A-ha! Aims! So we arrive at the dreaded "No True Scotsman". :)
So, what's *your* definition* of "civil society", then?
WorldWide Fund and Greenpeace seem to have "coercive aims", as in: they are trying to influence decisions of other people in a certain way. Sometimes even using intimidation.
Yet many would agree that these are civil society organisations. So:
 - could you define "coercive aims"?  - are Greenpeace and WWF civil society organisations, or not?
Interesting. Could you define "militant society" and perhaps draw the line between the two?
Okay, still needing a definition of "civil society", "coercive aims" and "militant society".
Like Greenpeace and WWF?
Okay. So why use two words for it?
Also, does that make the Internet Watch Foundation "criminal"?
How can I retain your meaning, if I do not understand it? Well, apart from the "shitbag" part, of course.
Thank goodness we were able to get to that conclusion. Eventually.
Well, it actually highlighted the definition problem. So, how do you define:
 - civil society
 - militant society
 - coercive aims
Wait, does your definition of "civil society" *require* an organisation to be a "libertarian voluntarist" one? And what would that mean?
So basically you make up your own meaning of words/phrases and call people names because they use it in a different way, without first explaining your way of using these terms? Uh-huh.

Absofuckinglutely not.
Now now, let's not bundle two distinct things. Nice try, but no bone.
I do hold that encryption systems should be as unbreakable as possible, or perhaps even more.
And at the same time I hold strongly (and have data to back it up) that this will not seriously hinder governments' ability to "enforce laws".
That's exactly why I call LEA's "argument" of "we need backdoors because HURDURRISTS" bullshit. No, no they don't. They have more than ample resources and means to do whatever it is they're doing without breaking encryption.

I did not say a single word about victims. But hey, let's play: if a mafia outlet kills a member of this very mafia outlet (due to some internal business), does that make that (dead) mafioso a victim?
If so, does that suddenly make the mafioso a "non-voluntary" mafioso?
Also, I would say that Wikipedia became a "victim" of Internet Watch Foundation's Internet censorship. I am perfectly happy to agree that Wikipedia was not a "voluntary" victim of it. However, does that make IWF suddenly not a civil society organisation?
Or, perhaps, we can actually have civil society organisations that (sadly) show signs of being corrupted by the power (over *something*)?
Well, at what point a voluntary organisation stops being voluntary? When they commit their first crime? I am confused about your usage of the word "voluntary" here. Are you not actually looking for "non-criminal"?
If that's your standard for "equating", then I have to ask... Why are you equating civil society to mafia? After all, you just "listed civil society and mafia in the same sentence".
Here it is again, for your distinct viewing pleasure:
That's actually a valid point. Your default answer will be "Teh Gubmint", and in the particular case of IWF, you'd actually be right.
Thing is, does that mean that we have:
 - a civil society organisation
 - that *you agree* has been to some extent corrupted by power they got?
It's a "yes/no" question.
And yet they are a civil society organisation. My point stands: *even* civil society can be corrupted by power. Do you not agree?
Governments are not good in and of themselves. But seeing *everything* that a government touches as evil/bad/criminal/your-word-here is akin to seeing everything that contains mercury (the element) as toxic. If that doesn't ring a bell, let me help you with that:
So basically, yes, I am now calling your anti-Tor bullshit akin to the anti-
vaccine crowd bullshit (or, as I prefer to call them, "pro-disease").
Power bad always, needs to be checked, *regardless* of whether or not it (power) happens to be in the hands of a government, mafia, private sector, civil society, or pixies and unicorns.
Problem is, there are many, many different power structures. Governments are one kind of these. But there are many more, and they emerge on their own, all the time. Looking *only* on governments (and mafia) and missing the broader picture is just plain silly.
Still, sometimes I would love to have your simple "gummint bad, private sector good, remove gummint and the free market will cure cancer" view of the world. One can dream...

I was thinking (and I'm sure somebody else also got the idea) that maybe combining ideas from Tor with ideas from BotTorrent might be a way to go. Distribute the stuff people access among people accessing it and it becomes harder to do timing attacks, and the network might work a bit faster too.
However, it's basically running full speed into one of the two hard problems in IT -- cache invalidation. So, I don't know.

as "A Miner Problem" shows, even a distributed, p2p solution like BitCoin suffers from a secondary centralisation flaw. Simply put, economy of scale lets the biggest player or a cartel of thoise basically undermine the "decentralized" part and take control over the network.
A similar thing has happened with e-mail and GMail. GMail basically dictates the rules in the e-mail world, simply because they're the largest and have the most users. Again, economy of scale is to blame.
So let me pose a question here: is it possible to design a protocol that does not succumb to economy of scale-based secondary centralisation? Is it possible to design a protocol that does not lend itself to economy of scale?

Such was also the idea in BitCoin. As we can see, there's a secondary (not protocol-level) centralisation happening there. Cartels emerge, because economy of scale makes them viable, and indeed profitable.
Yes, TorChat, IPFS, Tox are good examples. I'd be hard-pressed to identify any economy of scale possible there, I guess.
It's not centralized in a way Facebook is, for example. While e-mail was obviously never a p2p system, it was not a centralized system. The idea was decentralized, federated among *many* servers.
But economy of scale did its magic and now we have a small number of companies controlling almost all of it.

Apologies for being vague; I just feel there's something to it, but can't really put my finger on it.
I see economies of scale driving a lot of not-so-great outcomes (centralisation of e-mail providers; centralisation of ISPs and the general Internet infrastructure, introducing single points of failure in many places). And that makes me wonder what can be done about it.
How so?

It seems "we" have yet to take our heads out of our asses and stop using centralized shit because "it's convenient".

I was thinking (and I'm sure somebody else also got the idea) that maybe combining ideas from Tor with ideas from BotTorrent might be a way to go. Distribute the stuff people access among people accessing it and it becomes harder to do timing attacks, and the network might work a bit faster too.
However, it's basically running full speed into one of the two hard problems in IT -- cache invalidation. So, I don't know.
