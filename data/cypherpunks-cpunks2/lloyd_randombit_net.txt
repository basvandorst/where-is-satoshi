I just created a new mailman list
as a venue for discussions that would normally go to cypherpunks but
hasn't because of the name or spam or whatever reason, and which
are off topic for this list so haven't happened here.
As with this list, postings allowed only by subscribers, strong attempt
at automated spam control but no human moderation. Enjoy.
