Good reason to just let this list die. Bunch of OLD angry people with no life but to sit around and bitch and moan about shit all day long. What a miserable life.

We (as in the Wubim Foundation) are a small Canadian non-profit founded
to advocate for digital rights, freedom of speech and open access to
academia. We've mostly been doing lobby work in Canada, helping publish
a few books that aren't too mainstream or not fit for distribution in
their home countries and running the XMPP servers adastra.re and
cypherpunks.it at the moment.
Most of us grew up during the cypherpunks movement so we were heavily
influenced by them and they're kinda what inspired us to start the
non-profit in the first place. Some of us still lurk on this list or
participate behind pseudonyms admittedly.

I joined this list because i thought it was about technology and security. Wow - this anti-govt shit has got to go. Where i live people disappear offending the wrong person.

Wow! How much hate and bitterness in this little hairy heart, eh? :-/
All lives deserve respect, miserable or not. And the concept of "miserable life" is very relative. For me, a miserable life means feel pleasure in offend people, disrespecting their work, their contributions.
If you want to collaborate and make a better cypherpunks list, please, do it. We, "old angry people", will be very thankful. :)
If you want to help, can contact me in private. But, if you just want to complain like an old grumpy curmudgeon, please, be coherent and don't spend your miserable life here.
Take care and eat chocolate! <3
