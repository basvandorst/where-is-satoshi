If you disagree with the talking point then you must agree with the agrument it stands against.
For example, you should not speak the language of a culture unless you are of that culture.

Scott Adams, the creator of the popular comic strip Dilbert got his MBA at UC Berkeley and has remained a top donor, both in money and time.
After the recent riots, where Democrat terrorists “Antifa” set fires, vandalized property and beat Trump supporters unconscious, Adams had pulled his funding from the troubled liberal university.
— Scott Adams ( February 4, 2017
From blog.dilbert.com:
Here’s the best article you are likely to read about the absurdity of calling ANY American president Hitler. This is the sort of persuasion (sprinkled with facts) that can dissolve some of the post-election cognitive dissonance that hangs like a dark cloud over the country. Share it liberally, so to speak. You might save lives.
Speaking of Hitler, I’m ending my support of UC Berkeley, where I got my MBA years ago. I have been a big supporter lately, with both my time and money, but that ends today. I wish them well, but I wouldn’t feel safe or welcome on the campus. A Berkeley professor made that clear to me recently. He seems smart, so I’ll take his word for it.
I’ve decided to side with the Jewish gay immigrant who has an African-American boyfriend, not the hypnotized zombie-boys in black masks who were clubbing people who hold different points of view. I feel that’s reasonable, but I know many will disagree, and possibly try to club me to death if I walk on campus.
Yesterday I asked my most liberal, Trump-hating friend if he ever figured out why Republicans have most of the Governorships, a majority in Congress, the White House, and soon the Supreme Court. He said, “There are no easy answers.”
I submit that there are easy answers. But for many Americans, cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias hide those easy answers behind Hitler hallucinations.
I’ll keep working on clearing the fog. Estimated completion date, December 2017. It’s a big job.

Seems there are misrepresentations of the travel ban and the law behind it.
[U.S. Code, Title 8, Chapter 12, Subchapter II, Part II, § 1182, Paragraph (f)]
Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by the President
Full Speech:
https:// youtube.com/watch?v=502Eujo1P94
US Code:
https:// law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182
Here is what was said:
“You could be a lawyer, or you don’t have to be a lawyer. If you were a good student in high school or a bad student in high school, you can understand this, and it’s really incredible to me that we have a court case that’s going on so long.
As you know in Boston, we won it with a highly respected judge, and a very strong opinion but now we're in an area that, let's just say, they are interpreting things differently than probably a hundred percent of the people in this room. I'd like to almost know, does anybody in this room disagree when I read this?
I'm gonna read what's in dispute, what's in question. And you'll see this, it's:
[U.S. Code, Title 8, Chapter 12, Subchapter II, Part II, § 1182, Paragraph (f)]
Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by the President
Okay, now, this isn't just me, this is for Obama, for Ronald Regan, for, the Peresident, and this was, done, very importantly, for security. Something you people know more about than all of us. It was done for the security of our nation. The security of our citizens. So that people come in who aren't going to do us harm. And that's why it was done. And it couldn't of been written any more precicely, it's not like "Oh, gee, we wish it were written better". It was written beautifully.
So just listen, here's what it says, this is what they're arguing:
Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.
Okay, so you can suspend, you can put restrictions, you can do whatever you want. And this is for the security of the country, which, again, you're the chiefs, you're the sheriffs, you understand this. And, I listened to lawyers on both sides last night and they were talking about things that had just nothing to do with it. I listened to a panel of judges and I'll comment on that but I will not comment on the statements made by, certainly one judge, but I have to be honest, that if these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court, in terms of respect for the court, they'd do what they should be doing.
I mean, it's so sad, they should be, you know when you read something so simple, and so beautifully written, so perfectly written, other than the one statement of course, having to do with 'he' or 'she', but when you read something so perfectly written and so clear, to anybody, and then you have lawyers and you watch, I watched last night, in amazement, and I heard things that I couldn't believe, things that really had nothing to do with what I just read, and I don't ever want to call a court biased, so I wont call it biased, and we haven't had a decision yet, but courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what's right. And that has to do with the security of our country, which is so important."

Who, BAMN, the sudo anarcho-commies who smash up the SF Bay ?
Don't know who BAMN is ? Let this ex-member tell you who they are:
- - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - -
Letter from UCB alumn Jevon
I am running with Students for a Democratic University (SDU) as Student Advocate and I am an ex-member of BAMN. I think I can give a little bit of an insider's perspective as to why it is not a good idea to have dealings with that organization. The dislike that most people in the activist community on campus have of BAMN stems from the fact that they are very sectarian, undemocratic, and obnoxious. If the problems with BAMN stopped there, I would be for working with them. However, internally, that organization is a lot more corrupt than people realize.
The organization is tightly controlled by two members, the President, Shanta , and another founding member named Leland. There is no democracy in the organization. Members are encouraged to follow whatever perspective and course of action that Shanta and Leland put forward. When disagreements arise between base members of the group and the leadership (i.e. Shanta and Leland), that is when things get scary. In order to coerce people into doing what they want them to do, at the leadership's command, this organization engages in a whole host of disgusting behavior like physically dragging people to meetings and political events, denouncing members who disagree as crazy/suicidal and encouraging them to take unprescribed medication, stealing money and i.d. cards to restrict the movement of dissident members, spreading lies about such members to turn others against them, etc. The list goes on and on. The way the organization makes this possible is often by convincing members to abandon their lives and come live in BAMN households. There, such members often become financially dependent on BAMN and many times, have no choice but to comply with orders so that they can eat and not end up homeless. Furthermore, many of theBAMN members are teenagers so this fact makes it even more possible for BAMN to prey on people that become financially dependent on them.
This issue has been coming up a lot lately so I am going to write a much more coherent statement on it documenting my horrible experience with this organization but I will start to talk about that here. I was one of those teenagers. I joined BAMN when I was 14 and remained in the organized until I was nearly 18. When I was sixteen, BAMN convinced me that my family was abusive and crazy and that it was better that I move in with BAMN members. I did so against my family's will. When my family started to look for me, BAMN advised me that it was best that I move from my hometown (Detroit, MI) to live with BAMN members in another part of the country. They told me that I could legally solicit emancipation (without my parent's consent) upon turning 17 and since my birthday was soon, this meant that I would not be away from Detroit for longer than one month. However, they lied. They took me to Oakland, CA to live with Yvette Felarca and instructed me to change my name to "Chase Stern" and cut off all contact with family and friends and even other BAMN members in Detroit. I complied, thinking that that would only be for a short time.
However, upon turning 17, BAMN's leadership in Detroit just did not answer my phone calls. When they finally answered, they told me I had to just wait a little longer and each time, I would ask when I got to go home, this is the answer they would give me. I ended up being in Oakland for a year.
A few weeks before I turned 18, I decided that I wanted to end the ordeal so I contacted my family and reconciled with them. My mother bought me a plane ticket back to Detroit. When I informed BAMN, they tried to talk me out of leaving, but I was adamant on returning home for at least a little while and having a chance to reestablish relations with my family and friends. When they realized they could not talk me out of leaving, they got physical. Yvette Felarca came into my room one night and instructed me to read out loud a statement that Shanta Driver had written and convinced me to sign about how my family was abusive. Tired of debating my decision with them, I refused. That night, Yvette and other BAMN members took turns sleeping by my bed to "make sure he doesn't go anywhere." They confiscated my house keys to restrict my movement.
The day before my flight back to Detroit, I was packing my clothes when BAMN members came in and told me that I could not pack my clothes in that luggage because that was luggage that they had provided me with. At this point, I still had illusions in BAMNso I called Shanta Driver, thinking that Yvette was just being unreasonable and overly pushy and that Shanta would work everything out. I told her what was happening and asked her to speak with Yvette and the other BAMN members and request that they let me leave. Much to my astonishment, Shanta refused. At that moment, I realized that I was in a cult and not only was Shanta well aware of what was taking place but that it was her plan all along. I called my mom at that point and in the midst of me talking to her, one of the BAMN members, Adi Hoag, a former Berkeley student, screamed "Grab his phone!" and 3 BAMN members grabbed me and tried to take my phone. Luckily, they were all pretty slightly built women so I managed to push them off of me and make it outside the house. I ran to the neighbors, explained to them what was going on, and she let me inside and closed the door.
My mom called the police and when they came, BAMN made up a lie about how I was trying to steal things from them. There were two white police officers and the 3 BAMN members there at the time were three white women so shockingly (or maybe not so shockingly), the police believed them and treated me like shit. All I was trying to do was get my belongings and get away and the cop said to me: "You, yourself, admit to be a runaway so why should we believe anything you say?" and "I should take you to juvenile and make you miss your flight tomorrow." I insisted on being able to get my belongings and at some point, the cops gave in and escorted me inside to get my things. Once inside, I discovered that BAMN had stolen the $70 I had in my room and all my id cards. I got what I could and left. The phone that I was using had been disconnected since it was the name of Mark Airgood, aBAMN member and teacher in Oakland.
The neighbor, however, let me use her phone to phone a friend, whose parents let me stay at his house and dropped me off at the airport the next morning. When I tried to inform other BAMN members about what had happened to me, particularly other youth many of whom I had recruited and therefore felt responsible for putting at risk, I learned that BAMN had denounced me to everyone. They told people that I had went crazy and turned against the organization and went to the police and that everyone should call off all contact with me. They were also instructed to report my whereabouts to Shanta because they were looking for me to put me in a mental institution. Some BAMN members complied with this order but many did not, and ended up leaving the org in the fallout. I have heard many lies that BAMN spread about me to cover up what they did, including telling people that I tried to kill myself and that's why they intervened in the way that they did.
When I got to Detroit and started to tell people about my experiences, I learned from some ex-BAMN members (who had remained silent) that I was not the only person that had an experience like that with BAMN. There were many others. Some of these stories are even documented on the Internet.
Anyway, for the longest, I have been publicly silent about my experience with BAMN because like others, I have believed that since they play such an active role in politics, on and off campus, it's better to not bump heads with them. However, a few days ago, I received a phone call from a BAMN member that I had never met before. He had gotten my phone number from other ex-members of BAMN and he wanted to talk to me to help him through his hellacious experience with BAMN. At that moment, I realized that I could no longer remain silent. This organization is continuing to manipulate young people and it has to stop. This is a really dangerous thing because this organization is luring young activist-minded individuals and unlike me, most of the people who surviveBAMN draw the conclusion that they must abandon struggle. BAMN either converts you into a drone or it kills your fighting spirit.
I feel so strongly as to not working with BAMN that I think it's worth sharing that deeply personal story with all of you. I feel like by working with them we are validating their disgusting tactics and empowering them to get away with things like this with more people. That's my piece.

Irony: Migrant Riots in Sweden day after 'Outrage' over Trump Comment.
http:// macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/31339/53/
It would appear the fakestream media (along with several celebrities and Swedish politicians) is going to be apologizing to US President Trump once again. As a reminder, Trump this weekend mentioned Sweden has turned into a security mess due to their out of control muslim migration.
Having spent the entire news cycle trying to ignore the massive immigrant crisis facing Sweden, and pin the ignorant tail on Trump, the biggest Swedish daily newspapers, Dagbladet and Expressen report riots breaking out in the highly immigrant concentrated Stockholm borough of Rinkeby, with police firing warning shots as 100s of young muslim migrants threw stones and burned cars.
During the evening hundreds of people gathered in the center of Rinkeby, well known for its high concentration of immigrants and people with immigrant ancestry.
The Swedish leftists politicians who were "outraged" by Trump's statement, claimed Sweden had no issues with migrants and offered their usual liberal lectures, but are now nowhere to be found, their twitter accounts on fire over the weekend, are now silent.
In June 2010, Rinkeby was the scene of riots and attacks against the local police station and Rinkeby is the region in which the '60 Minutes' crew were attacked in 2016.
The problems Sweden faces integrating large numbers of Muslim immigrants is a subject on which Nordstjernan columnist Ulf Nilson has written many times. His warnings of increasing radicalization among Sweden’s Muslims – warnings he started to broadcast a decade ago – now seem eerily prophetic in light of an Associated Press investigation that found Stockholm to be a breeding ground for jihadists among Swedish Somalis.
According to the AP report, which first ran Jan. 24, an al-Qaida-linked group is busy recruiting anti-government fighters among Somali youths living in Rinkeby. A suburb of Stockholm, Rinkeby has earned the nickname of “Little Mogadishu” because of the number of Somalis living there. Rinkeby is also the center of the recruiting efforts of al-Shabab, a group with ties to al-Qaida.

Thirteen people were arrested in Portland, Oregon, after a small group protesting President Donald Trump got smashed by the police.
The demonstrators, who did not have a permit, spilled out onto the streets outside the Federal Building and failed to heed the warnings of police in murder gear.
The protest was just one of several held across the country as part of the 'not my Presidents' Day' rallies for Trump.
Planned marches took place in New York, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Chicago, and Salt Lake City to mark President's Day.
Protesters even greeted the president on the route from his Mar-a-Lago home to Palm Beach Airport where he boarded Air Force One to return to Washington DC in the afternoon.
The planned protest, held an hour later with permitted street closures, occurred without problems with the police. Police deployed pepper spray and 'less-than-lethal munitions' in the earlier clash with protests

Only thing about 2004/5 "expansion" of the "rape" "law" that I could find (wiki source was shit) was "rape with more offenders": 2005: 90 Våldtäkt utvidgas/våldtäktpå minderåriga.
Dates you are looking for are 1975 & 1992.
1975: Immigrant and Minority Policy:
Since the Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish, crime has exploded. Violent crime has increased by more than 300%, and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472%.""
1992: 147 Våldtäkt utvidgas:
For example, in 1992 a legislative change came into force which shifted the dividing line between sexual assault and rape. This legislative change resulted in about a 25% increase in the level of registered rape offences.""
It is exponential in growth since 70's, read pdfs, don't be like John.
From some shit linked before:
Sweden did not become a country of immigration again until World War II. The modern era of immigration can be divided into four distinct stages, with each stage representing different types of immigrants and immigration:
1) Refugees from neighboring countries (1938 to 1948)
2) Labor immigration from Finland and southern Europe (1949 to 1971)
3) Family reunification and refugees from developing countries (1972 to 1989)
4) Asylum seekers from southeastern and Eastern Europe (1990 to present)
As a result of these differing flows, the once-dominant Scandinavians, who composed well over half of Sweden's foreign-born population in 1960, made up only one-fourth of the foreign born in 2004.""
But to your point, Juan, Here is a table of all the "victim" protection "laws" passed in Sweden since the 70's:

Rates have lowered, it seems, lol.
It seems that this is some 8D chess, where the President claims a pro gun-censorship "fact" to shed light on the reality that as guns and "mass shootings" increase in number and occurrence, death rates are actually eaual-to or lower-than the late 60's, "when kids were safe to just play the streets".
Keep in mind:
The killing of a felon by a peace officer in the line of duty.""
The killing of a felon, during the commission of a felony, by a private citizen.""
Because these killings are determined through law enforcement investigation to be justifiable, they are tabulated separately from murder and nonnegligent manslaughter.""
And to your point, quotes are "45 years"; accusation that you are a lying shill would be false, while reality that you mispoke or misremebered (or were fed disinformation) becomes more likely. Pay that respect to your president.

Scott Adams, the creator of the popular comic strip Dilbert got his MBA at UC Berkeley and has remained a top donor, both in money and time.
After the recent riots, where Democrat terrorists “Antifa” set fires, vandalized property and beat Trump supporters unconscious, Adams had pulled his funding from the troubled liberal university.
— Scott Adams ( February 4, 2017
From blog.dilbert.com:
Here’s the best article you are likely to read about the absurdity of calling ANY American president Hitler. This is the sort of persuasion (sprinkled with facts) that can dissolve some of the post-election cognitive dissonance that hangs like a dark cloud over the country. Share it liberally, so to speak. You might save lives.
Speaking of Hitler, I’m ending my support of UC Berkeley, where I got my MBA years ago. I have been a big supporter lately, with both my time and money, but that ends today. I wish them well, but I wouldn’t feel safe or welcome on the campus. A Berkeley professor made that clear to me recently. He seems smart, so I’ll take his word for it.
I’ve decided to side with the Jewish gay immigrant who has an African-American boyfriend, not the hypnotized zombie-boys in black masks who were clubbing people who hold different points of view. I feel that’s reasonable, but I know many will disagree, and possibly try to club me to death if I walk on campus.
Yesterday I asked my most liberal, Trump-hating friend if he ever figured out why Republicans have most of the Governorships, a majority in Congress, the White House, and soon the Supreme Court. He said, “There are no easy answers.”
I submit that there are easy answers. But for many Americans, cognitive dissonance and confirmation bias hide those easy answers behind Hitler hallucinations.
I’ll keep working on clearing the fog. Estimated completion date, December 2017. It’s a big job.

Seems there are misrepresentations of the travel ban and the law behind it.
[U.S. Code, Title 8, Chapter 12, Subchapter II, Part II, § 1182, Paragraph (f)]
Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by the President
Full Speech:
https:// youtube.com/watch?v=502Eujo1P94
US Code:
https:// law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/8/1182
Here is what was said:
“You could be a lawyer, or you don’t have to be a lawyer. If you were a good student in high school or a bad student in high school, you can understand this, and it’s really incredible to me that we have a court case that’s going on so long.
As you know in Boston, we won it with a highly respected judge, and a very strong opinion but now we're in an area that, let's just say, they are interpreting things differently than probably a hundred percent of the people in this room. I'd like to almost know, does anybody in this room disagree when I read this?
I'm gonna read what's in dispute, what's in question. And you'll see this, it's:
[U.S. Code, Title 8, Chapter 12, Subchapter II, Part II, § 1182, Paragraph (f)]
Suspension of entry or imposition of restrictions by the President
Okay, now, this isn't just me, this is for Obama, for Ronald Regan, for, the Peresident, and this was, done, very importantly, for security. Something you people know more about than all of us. It was done for the security of our nation. The security of our citizens. So that people come in who aren't going to do us harm. And that's why it was done. And it couldn't of been written any more precicely, it's not like "Oh, gee, we wish it were written better". It was written beautifully.
So just listen, here's what it says, this is what they're arguing:
Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.
Okay, so you can suspend, you can put restrictions, you can do whatever you want. And this is for the security of the country, which, again, you're the chiefs, you're the sheriffs, you understand this. And, I listened to lawyers on both sides last night and they were talking about things that had just nothing to do with it. I listened to a panel of judges and I'll comment on that but I will not comment on the statements made by, certainly one judge, but I have to be honest, that if these judges wanted to, in my opinion, help the court, in terms of respect for the court, they'd do what they should be doing.
I mean, it's so sad, they should be, you know when you read something so simple, and so beautifully written, so perfectly written, other than the one statement of course, having to do with 'he' or 'she', but when you read something so perfectly written and so clear, to anybody, and then you have lawyers and you watch, I watched last night, in amazement, and I heard things that I couldn't believe, things that really had nothing to do with what I just read, and I don't ever want to call a court biased, so I wont call it biased, and we haven't had a decision yet, but courts seem to be so political, and it would be so great for our justice system if they would be able to read a statement and do what's right. And that has to do with the security of our country, which is so important."

Who, BAMN, the sudo anarcho-commies who smash up the SF Bay ?
Don't know who BAMN is ? Let this ex-member tell you who they are:
- - - - - - - -
- - - - - - - -
Letter from UCB alumn Jevon
I am running with Students for a Democratic University (SDU) as Student Advocate and I am an ex-member of BAMN. I think I can give a little bit of an insider's perspective as to why it is not a good idea to have dealings with that organization. The dislike that most people in the activist community on campus have of BAMN stems from the fact that they are very sectarian, undemocratic, and obnoxious. If the problems with BAMN stopped there, I would be for working with them. However, internally, that organization is a lot more corrupt than people realize.
The organization is tightly controlled by two members, the President, Shanta , and another founding member named Leland. There is no democracy in the organization. Members are encouraged to follow whatever perspective and course of action that Shanta and Leland put forward. When disagreements arise between base members of the group and the leadership (i.e. Shanta and Leland), that is when things get scary. In order to coerce people into doing what they want them to do, at the leadership's command, this organization engages in a whole host of disgusting behavior like physically dragging people to meetings and political events, denouncing members who disagree as crazy/suicidal and encouraging them to take unprescribed medication, stealing money and i.d. cards to restrict the movement of dissident members, spreading lies about such members to turn others against them, etc. The list goes on and on. The way the organization makes this possible is often by convincing members to abandon their lives and come live in BAMN households. There, such members often become financially dependent on BAMN and many times, have no choice but to comply with orders so that they can eat and not end up homeless. Furthermore, many of theBAMN members are teenagers so this fact makes it even more possible for BAMN to prey on people that become financially dependent on them.
This issue has been coming up a lot lately so I am going to write a much more coherent statement on it documenting my horrible experience with this organization but I will start to talk about that here. I was one of those teenagers. I joined BAMN when I was 14 and remained in the organized until I was nearly 18. When I was sixteen, BAMN convinced me that my family was abusive and crazy and that it was better that I move in with BAMN members. I did so against my family's will. When my family started to look for me, BAMN advised me that it was best that I move from my hometown (Detroit, MI) to live with BAMN members in another part of the country. They told me that I could legally solicit emancipation (without my parent's consent) upon turning 17 and since my birthday was soon, this meant that I would not be away from Detroit for longer than one month. However, they lied. They took me to Oakland, CA to live with Yvette Felarca and instructed me to change my name to "Chase Stern" and cut off all contact with family and friends and even other BAMN members in Detroit. I complied, thinking that that would only be for a short time.
However, upon turning 17, BAMN's leadership in Detroit just did not answer my phone calls. When they finally answered, they told me I had to just wait a little longer and each time, I would ask when I got to go home, this is the answer they would give me. I ended up being in Oakland for a year.
A few weeks before I turned 18, I decided that I wanted to end the ordeal so I contacted my family and reconciled with them. My mother bought me a plane ticket back to Detroit. When I informed BAMN, they tried to talk me out of leaving, but I was adamant on returning home for at least a little while and having a chance to reestablish relations with my family and friends. When they realized they could not talk me out of leaving, they got physical. Yvette Felarca came into my room one night and instructed me to read out loud a statement that Shanta Driver had written and convinced me to sign about how my family was abusive. Tired of debating my decision with them, I refused. That night, Yvette and other BAMN members took turns sleeping by my bed to "make sure he doesn't go anywhere." They confiscated my house keys to restrict my movement.
The day before my flight back to Detroit, I was packing my clothes when BAMN members came in and told me that I could not pack my clothes in that luggage because that was luggage that they had provided me with. At this point, I still had illusions in BAMNso I called Shanta Driver, thinking that Yvette was just being unreasonable and overly pushy and that Shanta would work everything out. I told her what was happening and asked her to speak with Yvette and the other BAMN members and request that they let me leave. Much to my astonishment, Shanta refused. At that moment, I realized that I was in a cult and not only was Shanta well aware of what was taking place but that it was her plan all along. I called my mom at that point and in the midst of me talking to her, one of the BAMN members, Adi Hoag, a former Berkeley student, screamed "Grab his phone!" and 3 BAMN members grabbed me and tried to take my phone. Luckily, they were all pretty slightly built women so I managed to push them off of me and make it outside the house. I ran to the neighbors, explained to them what was going on, and she let me inside and closed the door.
My mom called the police and when they came, BAMN made up a lie about how I was trying to steal things from them. There were two white police officers and the 3 BAMN members there at the time were three white women so shockingly (or maybe not so shockingly), the police believed them and treated me like shit. All I was trying to do was get my belongings and get away and the cop said to me: "You, yourself, admit to be a runaway so why should we believe anything you say?" and "I should take you to juvenile and make you miss your flight tomorrow." I insisted on being able to get my belongings and at some point, the cops gave in and escorted me inside to get my things. Once inside, I discovered that BAMN had stolen the $70 I had in my room and all my id cards. I got what I could and left. The phone that I was using had been disconnected since it was the name of Mark Airgood, aBAMN member and teacher in Oakland.
The neighbor, however, let me use her phone to phone a friend, whose parents let me stay at his house and dropped me off at the airport the next morning. When I tried to inform other BAMN members about what had happened to me, particularly other youth many of whom I had recruited and therefore felt responsible for putting at risk, I learned that BAMN had denounced me to everyone. They told people that I had went crazy and turned against the organization and went to the police and that everyone should call off all contact with me. They were also instructed to report my whereabouts to Shanta because they were looking for me to put me in a mental institution. Some BAMN members complied with this order but many did not, and ended up leaving the org in the fallout. I have heard many lies that BAMN spread about me to cover up what they did, including telling people that I tried to kill myself and that's why they intervened in the way that they did.
When I got to Detroit and started to tell people about my experiences, I learned from some ex-BAMN members (who had remained silent) that I was not the only person that had an experience like that with BAMN. There were many others. Some of these stories are even documented on the Internet.
Anyway, for the longest, I have been publicly silent about my experience with BAMN because like others, I have believed that since they play such an active role in politics, on and off campus, it's better to not bump heads with them. However, a few days ago, I received a phone call from a BAMN member that I had never met before. He had gotten my phone number from other ex-members of BAMN and he wanted to talk to me to help him through his hellacious experience with BAMN. At that moment, I realized that I could no longer remain silent. This organization is continuing to manipulate young people and it has to stop. This is a really dangerous thing because this organization is luring young activist-minded individuals and unlike me, most of the people who surviveBAMN draw the conclusion that they must abandon struggle. BAMN either converts you into a drone or it kills your fighting spirit.
I feel so strongly as to not working with BAMN that I think it's worth sharing that deeply personal story with all of you. I feel like by working with them we are validating their disgusting tactics and empowering them to get away with things like this with more people. That's my piece.

It would appear the fakestream media (along with several celebrities and Swedish politicians) is going to be apologizing to US President Trump once again. As a reminder, Trump this weekend mentioned Sweden has turned into a security mess due to their out of control muslim migration.
Having spent the entire news cycle trying to ignore the massive immigrant crisis facing Sweden, and pin the ignorant tail on Trump, the biggest Swedish daily newspapers, Dagbladet and Expressen report riots breaking out in the highly immigrant concentrated Stockholm borough of Rinkeby, with police firing warning shots as 100s of young muslim migrants threw stones and burned cars.
During the evening hundreds of people gathered in the center of Rinkeby, well known for its high concentration of immigrants and people with immigrant ancestry.
The Swedish leftists politicians who were "outraged" by Trump's statement, claimed Sweden had no issues with migrants and offered their usual liberal lectures, but are now nowhere to be found, their twitter accounts on fire over the weekend, are now silent.
In June 2010, Rinkeby was the scene of riots and attacks against the local police station and Rinkeby is the region in which the '60 Minutes' crew were attacked in 2016.
The problems Sweden faces integrating large numbers of Muslim immigrants is a subject on which Nordstjernan columnist Ulf Nilson has written many times. His warnings of increasing radicalization among Sweden’s Muslims – warnings he started to broadcast a decade ago – now seem eerily prophetic in light of an Associated Press investigation that found Stockholm to be a breeding ground for jihadists among Swedish Somalis.
According to the AP report, which first ran Jan. 24, an al-Qaida-linked group is busy recruiting anti-government fighters among Somali youths living in Rinkeby. A suburb of Stockholm, Rinkeby has earned the nickname of “Little Mogadishu” because of the number of Somalis living there. Rinkeby is also the center of the recruiting efforts of al-Shabab, a group with ties to al-Qaida.

PORTLAND PROTEST!!! & Autistic Screeching
https:// youtube.com/watch?v=QGDrTeCmlVs
Thirteen people were arrested in Portland, Oregon, after a small group protesting President Donald Trump got smashed by the police.
The demonstrators, who did not have a permit, spilled out onto the streets outside the Federal Building and failed to heed the warnings of police in murder gear.
The protest was just one of several held across the country as part of the 'not my Presidents' Day' rallies for Trump.
Planned marches took place in New York, Los Angeles, Washington DC, Chicago, and Salt Lake City to mark President's Day.
Protesters even greeted the president on the route from his Mar-a-Lago home to Palm Beach Airport where he boarded Air Force One to return to Washington DC in the afternoon.
The planned protest, held an hour later with permitted street closures, occurred without problems with the police. Police deployed pepper spray and 'less-than-lethal munitions' in the earlier clash with protests

Only thing about 2004/5 "expansion" of the "rape" "law" that I could find (wiki source was shit) was "rape with more offenders": 2005: 90 Våldtäkt utvidgas/våldtäktpå minderåriga.
Dates you are looking for are 1975 & 1992.
1975: Immigrant and Minority Policy:
Since the Parliament decided in 1975 that Sweden should be multicultural and not Swedish, crime has exploded. Violent crime has increased by more than 300%, and rapes have increased by an unbelievable 1,472%.""
1992: 147 Våldtäkt utvidgas:
For example, in 1992 a legislative change came into force which shifted the dividing line between sexual assault and rape. This legislative change resulted in about a 25% increase in the level of registered rape offences.""
It is exponential in growth since 70's, read pdfs, don't be like John.
From some shit linked before:
Sweden did not become a country of immigration again until World War II. The modern era of immigration can be divided into four distinct stages, with each stage representing different types of immigrants and immigration:
1) Refugees from neighboring countries (1938 to 1948)
2) Labor immigration from Finland and southern Europe (1949 to 1971)
3) Family reunification and refugees from developing countries (1972 to 1989)
4) Asylum seekers from southeastern and Eastern Europe (1990 to present)
As a result of these differing flows, the once-dominant Scandinavians, who composed well over half of Sweden's foreign-born population in 1960, made up only one-fourth of the foreign born in 2004.""
But to your point, Juan, Here is a table of all the "victim" protection "laws" passed in Sweden since the 70's:

A local criticizing the "law":
https:// erlinghellenas.wordpress.com/2010/09/01/the-swedish-rape-law/
You can read the current "law" here: Chapter 6 of The Swedish Penal Code (1962:700):

Seems like you don't understand laws or logic, either. Seems fitting for a "law"yer.
The key to understanding is in the title of your post:
Deport [faggots] Crossing Border Illegally, Regardless of [who the fuck they are].
Sounds about right to me. Unless you want to end up like Elin Krantz (2011):

For 2 million illegal registered claim, here are two links referencing the same "study":

http:// infowars.com/up-to-2-million-non-citizens-illegally-registered-to-vote-in-the-us/
For 800,000 illegal votes claim, here is an article:
http:// washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jan/26/hillary-clinton-received-800000-votes-from-nonciti/
I see 3 and 5 mil claims but original quote was “if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.” then said “Forget that. Forget all that. Just take a look at the registration and we’re going to do it.”.
It was, following Bush Sr. and Obama, lol. Top three seems legit. Besides, he was fed that false statement right before he spoke, it seems.
Here is a video:

The national rate is not comparable to local rates, such as Chicago, which are up.

http:// deathpenaltyinfo.org/murder-rates-nationally-and-state
http:// deathpenaltyinfo.org/deterrence-states-without-death-penalty-have-had-consistently-lower-murder-rates
Rates have lowered, it seems, lol.
It seems that this is some 8D chess, where the President claims a pro gun-censorship "fact" to shed light on the reality that as guns and "mass shootings" increase in number and occurrence, death rates are actually eaual-to or lower-than the late 60's, "when kids were safe to just play the streets".
Keep in mind:
The killing of a felon by a peace officer in the line of duty.""
The killing of a felon, during the commission of a felony, by a private citizen.""
Because these killings are determined through law enforcement investigation to be justifiable, they are tabulated separately from murder and nonnegligent manslaughter.""
And to your point, quotes are "45 years"; accusation that you are a lying shill would be false, while reality that you mispoke or misremebered (or were fed disinformation) becomes more likely. Pay that respect to your president.
Still unraveling, fam.
He did not; he was imitating a standard retard. Which Kovaleski is, a mental retard.

You are correct. I should have written 'near-linear growth'. I see you agree with rest.
Lol. Wut.
https:// wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_Sweden:
Sweden began recording national crime statistics in 1950, and the method for recording crime has basically remained unchanged until the mid-1960s, when the Swedish police introduced new procedures for crime statistics, which have been presented as a partial explanation for the historical increase in crime reports."
From fucking xl doc:
https:// unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/statistics/crime/CTS_Sexual_violence.xls:
Definition: “Rape” means sexual intercourse without valid consent.""
If you graph the numbers for 'Rates per 100,000 Population' for Sweden, you get "muh growth".
But if you wanna look at pre-made graphs:

You dumb cunt, I agreed with you and provided more details into the laws. I guess we can't expect you to provide much more value to the list than Cecilia, calling names instead of putting forth a reasonable rebuttle.
To my point, the same "Swedish" defenition of "rape" is used in the US and the rates per capita are the same/down a bit since the 70's. But that's not including all the American ladies getting "raped" coming accross the southern border.
Trump is absolutely right about Sweden:

It’s well known for Scandinavians and other Europeans that liberal immigration comes with drugs, rapes, gang wars, robbery and violence.""

In b4 authoritarian LARPfags.
Google is rolling out a new service they're calling 'Perspective'. It uses a "neural network" to determine comment "toxicity", allowing for censorship and filtering. It is worth looking into for bias and to fuck with it.
There is an API that any app or Internet service can implement !
perspectiveapi .com [Requires JS cuz Google thinks that's the internets]
For example:
I voted for Trump registers 7% toxic while I voted for Hillary registers 4% toxic
Having some fun:
White Power
25% Toxic 75% Agree
Hitler Did Nothing Wrong
45% Toxic 55% Agree
Trump is the God Emporer
15% Toxic 85% Agree
Fuck Donald Trump
99% Toxic 1% Agree
We must secure the existence of our people and a future for "white" children
37% Toxic 63% Agree
Gas The Kikes
49% Toxic 51% Agree
Race War Now
25% Toxic 75% Are ready for it
Pretty much it's not all that inaccurate then. Wew.
I am sure those of you who want more lulz will find the right boards to share all the fun !
