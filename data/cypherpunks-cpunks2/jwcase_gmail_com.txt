Hey Al, You’ve got to have a pretty thick skin to be on a mailing list - sometimes people post several messages in a row that may be over your head,  in regards to people or events you have  no knowledge of, or just plain boring. In these cases it is best to just buddha-up - find your delete key and go with the flow. If you really can’t see why the members of this particular list might be interested this particular “celebrity’s” correspondence in this matter — if you truly have “no idea what it is about” — then perhaps you should save your comments until you do have some inkling of what’s going around you. Then you won’t appear petulant or uninformed when you wish to participate rationally at a later time. Good luck!

“fascism” from wikipedia - come on, there’s enough history and stuff here where we don’t need private definitions of the terms, you can actually even go read “the Doctrine Of Fascism: written when it was a viable political marketing strategy and not simply pejorative : Fascism was influenced by both left and right, conservative and anti-conservative, national and supranational, rational and anti-rational.[39]  A number of historians regard fascism as either a revolutionary centrist doctrine, as a doctrine that mixes philosophies of the left and the right, or as both of those things.[40] [41]  Fascism was founded during World War I  by Italian national syndicalists  who drew upon left-wing  and right-wing  political views.
Some scholars consider fascism to be right-wing because of its social conservatism  and its authoritarian means of opposing egalitarianism .[42] [43]  Roderick Stackelberg places fascism—including Nazism , which he says is "a radical variant of fascism"—on the political right, explaining that, "The more a person deems absolute equality among all people to be a desirable condition, the further left he or she will be on the ideological spectrum. The more a person considers inequality to be unavoidable or even desirable, the further to the right he or she will be."[44] Italian Fascism  gravitated to the right in the early 1920s.[45] [46]  A major element of fascist ideology that has been deemed to be far-right is its stated goal to promote the right of a supposedly superior people to dominate, while purging society of supposedly inferior elements.[47] In 1919 Benito Mussolini  described fascism as a movement that would strike "against the backwardness of the right and the destructiveness of the left".[48] [49]  Later, the Italian Fascists described their ideology as right-wing in the political program The Doctrine of Fascism , stating: "We are free to believe that this is the century of authority, a century tending to the 'right,' a fascist century."[50] [51]  Mussolini stated that fascism's position on the political spectrum was not a serious issue for fascists: "Fascism, sitting on the right, could also have sat on the mountain of the center ... These words in any case do not have a fixed and unchanged meaning: they do have a variable subject to location, time and spirit. We don't give a damn about these empty terminologies and we despise those who are terrorized by these words."[52] Joshua Case

If you are skeptical at efforts to define your own sworn enemy, you cannot say you know your enemy. A partisan appealing to the ‘expertise’ and ‘authority’ of another partisan who cannot maintain - even in his own mind - the definition of fascist. It’s the very definition of logical fallacy. Appeal to authority. Your enemy is Eurasia! We’ve always been at war with Eurasia! “Fascism” isn’t shapeshifting - the definition is. You invoke frightening ghosts to win support with invective you fail to comprehend. Your political opponents may be using new tactics, may be deplorable, but you need to call you enemy “fascist” otherwise it is difficult to defend the kind of histrionics you ask us to accept. You need to invoke death camps to justify your outrage. Without them, you’re simply registering a complaint and this drives you crazy - you need the ULTIMATE justification. The link at the bottom: “Is George Bush a Fascist?” - to which the answer is no; he was an asshole, but not a fascist anymore than Obama was or is - it directly contradicts the content of your copy/paste.
This shit is as boring as it is shallow. Let’s stop name calling and the faux revolutionary shit, seriously - you are beginning to feel like those Heaven’s Gate types - living these grown up fairy tails with definite good and evil and space men coming to save us, destroy us, entertain us!

Regardless of what you read back then when you decided to start dumping here, Tim May is not the topic of this list, nor is it his idea to use code and cryptography as a means of breaking a community's reliance on systems where the whole's  integrity relies on the good nature of human agency.  People are irrational. Cryptography can help defend against irrational actors. But it's hard. Hard to learn math, hard to get feel compelled to give back to a society that treats you like shit  inadvertently yet by design. I used to read things that helped me do the hard stuff here. You break that resource for me, call me semen, stupid, troll, then tell me the nature of this list? This list which I watched you join?

@_subject: SS-GB: why the renewed obsession with alternative Nazi histories? 
Well he’s correct in a way - in 1962 Philip K Dick wrote a novel called Man In The High Tower - several of his books have already been made into movies and television shows. He was mainly into extremely speculative, futurist Science-Fiction - Total Recall, Bladerunner, A Scanner Darkly - all from his pen. He dealt heavily with Gnostic ideas, hidden knowledge and spiritual notions of early christianity, the divine veil - he wrote some very strong material. There are reports that he had "mental health issues” though who knows what that means - I don’t know anyone who doesn’t, but he was definitely not a neo-NAZI, philosophically - you can gather this from his writing, particularly in his Exegesis   where he describes his contact with VALIS - Vast Active Living Intelligence System - he had other things on his mind. In short, i think the described proliferation of the alternate histories in the early 60s, and again now coincide with release and re-release of his novel - which was inspired by Ward’s novel using the same idea, that the other side had won the war, with the American Civil War…
PKD was a great mind and singular poet, his loss is sad for artists. Hope you don’t mind me replying personally, don’t want to cause anyone to splash noise on the list because they feel compelled to disagree with me out of spite or annoyance or whatever, hope you’re well,  - Joshua Case

meaning, you won’t interact with me unless it’s in front of other people? because you need that level of attention? I was just trying to reduce the level of idiocy before i just plain muted you, like everyone else on this list has, and are imploring me to do. i’m not insecure with respect to my intellect, or schmuckiness - i’m alarmed that you’d use such a patriarchal type of genitals insult. i’m smart enough to see through people like you, and i am not a penis.

As an unintelligent person, with some kind of physical disability which causes slow cognition - a precondition of genetic nature maybe? As 'sperm on the ground', or am I a fascist too now? Can people of color be fascist? I'm uninformed. Would be really fascinating to hear your thoughts. I don’t copy-paste off topic news story links to the list nearly as much as you do, no, and you are an effective troll. true. It’s been a nice ride. Thanks!

Would be interesting is to know how long it took Obama to fire Bush’s info-sec chief. Looking around, any one know offhand? Seems like usual turnover type business to me, really. I mean, do you really need a witch-hunt when the Whitehouse changes hands from one party to another? Seems like tactical reporting really. Obviously Trump is intolerable and dooming the west, but the stories are all so breathless….

Ha, This from the mouth of the individual/s that refused to even speak about how he defines or identifies the “fascists” he would like to abuse, instead calling me “stupid” and literally “Semen on the ground.”
Raze, do you even talk to the other trolls that use this email account?

If you are skeptical at efforts to define your own sworn enemy, you cannot say you know your enemy. A partisan appealing to the ‘expertise’ and ‘authority’ of another partisan who cannot maintain - even in his own mind - the definition of fascist. It’s the very definition of logical fallacy. Appeal to authority. Your enemy is Eurasia! We’ve always been at war with Eurasia! “Fascism” isn’t shapeshifting - the definition is. You invoke frightening ghosts to win support with invective you fail to comprehend. Your political opponents may be using new tactics, may be deplorable, but you need to call you enemy “fascist” otherwise it is difficult to defend the kind of histrionics you ask us to accept. You need to invoke death camps to justify your outrage. Without them, you’re simply registering a complaint and this drives you crazy - you need the ULTIMATE justification. The link at the bottom: “Is George Bush a Fascist?” - to which the answer is no; he was an asshole, but not a fascist anymore than Obama was or is - it directly contradicts the content of your copy/paste.
This shit is as boring as it is shallow. Let’s stop name calling and the faux revolutionary shit, seriously - you are beginning to feel like those Heaven’s Gate types - living these grown up fairy tails with definite good and evil and space men coming to save us, destroy us, entertain us! It’s shit. Write some code, or go the fuck away.

Take your half baked political noise back to reddit or whatever. This list is not your fucking personal Pinterest for political marketing.  It had a topic and a purpose, and it was better before you started posting. Which I remember clearly.
Regardless of what you read back then when you decided to start dumping here, Tim May is not the topic of this list, nor is it his idea to use code and cryptography as a means of breaking a community's reliance on systems where the whole's  integrity relies on the good nature of human agency.  People are irrational. Cryptography can help defend against irrational actors. But it's hard. Hard to learn math, hard to get feel compelled to give back to a society that treats you like shit  inadvertently yet by design. I used to read things that helped me do the hard stuff here. You break that resource for me, call me semen, stupid, troll, then tell me the nature of this list? This list which I watched you join? And now it's just Rayzr, spitting his "series of shock slogans and mindless token tantrums" - and I should fuck off? I doubt it. This is why we can't have nice things.

@_subject: SS-GB: why the renewed obsession with alternative Nazi histories? 
Well he’s correct in a way - in 1962 Philip K Dick wrote a novel called Man In The High Tower - several of his books have already been made into movies and television shows. He was mainly into extremely speculative, futurist Science-Fiction - Total Recall, Bladerunner, A Scanner Darkly - all from his pen. He dealt heavily with Gnostic ideas, hidden knowledge and spiritual notions of early christianity, the divine veil - he wrote some very strong material. There are reports that he had "mental health issues” though who knows what that means - I don’t know anyone who doesn’t, but he was definitely not a neo-NAZI, philosophically - you can gather this from his writing, particularly in his Exegesis   where he describes his contact with VALIS - Vast Active Living Intelligence System - he had other things on his mind. In short, i think the described proliferation of the alternate histories in the early 60s, and again now coincide with release and re-release of his novel - which was inspired by Ward’s novel using the same idea, that the other side had won the war, with the American Civil War…
PKD was a great mind and singular poet, his loss is sad for artists. Hope you don’t mind me replying personally, don’t want to cause anyone to splash noise on the list because they feel compelled to disagree with me out of spite or annoyance or whatever, hope you’re well,  - Joshua Case

Though you would agree that this exists though, and is of late gaining momentum of some sort, yes?
 And while it pretends to play nice, you are never a click away from overtly fascist neo-nazi siege-heiling in front of a camera.
I defend the right to speech that I do not agree with, but war starts in speech - and things are escalating. It’s not just  a sense I’ve got, you can look at the attendance and participation changes.
You cannot pretend this isn’t real, and problematic. You can’t act as if all people are rational actors, if they were the free market system would have worked! (Ok last line was open trolling, Jim)

James, will you please, for the list, copy paste and post where I proposed anything, other than thoughtfulness with respect to the political noise on the board who’s topic has become a subject of dispute recently?  There is a tripartite disjunction that can be created from your message’s content - you are either stupid, did not read the material, or are just willfully disruptive.
The actual Nazi’s have a more civil board, they seem to read each others posts before they reply.
