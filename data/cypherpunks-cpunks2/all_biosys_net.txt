Even if you trust each remailer to "do the right thing" only 10% of the
time, by chaining 10 such remailers the probability of having your identity
revealed is only 1 in 10^10 - assuming that the remailers are independent.
[That secondary assumption can be improved by chosing remailers in different
No - that by using an open-relay mailer you get the same anonymity as using
a Type 1 / Type 2 remailer.
Funny, that's how it looked for everyone. Admit it - you said something
stupid. [Even I admit I'm wrong sometimes. ]
Most of the regular subscribers are tired of the complaints (which are
usually worse - as in more and bigger - than the spam).
I don't use any (deleting) filters; I read about 500 messages each day, and
it only takes me 2-3 hours. A friend of mine reads around 2,000 messages
each day. It's not such a big deal.
Yep. Same thing - the fear of lawsuits - is why we were warned, when we came
to the US, to not even look at our female colleagues: even a hint of a
lawsuit would make our employer send us back to our country in a heartbeat -
whether we're guilty or not. [They wouldn't care.]
US sucks a lot. Too bad this is where the money is :)
One word: Freenet. See No. There already is a solution: the client filters everything. Wait,
there's also a second one: build your own cypherpunks node. [The second one
is even better.]
Spam takes <1 second to identify and delete.
Here I agree with you :)

You want to use a 4096-bit key for SYMMETRICAL crypto? Hello? Not only I
don't know of ANY symmetrical algorithm with such a key, but why on Earth
would you need it for? What attack do you know against a 128-bit or even
256-bit key that doesn't work against a 4096-bit one?
What symmetric crypto algorithm is that?
Did I mention that I wrote a Yarrow implementation in Delphi?  It passes
DIEHARD, but it hasn't been otherwise checked. [Public domain, btw.]
I like this guy :) [All my code is public domain, but I hate the GPL for
*forcing* people to share. Communism at its best.]

The library I like most is HIT -  it's not free
You could also find a good one at
 - it's the one recommended by
the writer of DCPCrypt (Dave Barton). [See  ]
