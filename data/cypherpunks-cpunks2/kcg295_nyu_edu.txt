qTox has been pretty good for me, and I got a lot of friends to move
over to it. The calls are absolute garbage, and every now and then there
will be issues with people disconnecting seemingly at random, but
all-in-all it is decent to use.
The only thing that worries me is that key verification is based on the
fact that you have an entire public key as a user's ID. This lacks
usability for non-technical users, especially since very few people
actually exchange IDs over a secure third channel.

This is an interesting argument.
For clarification on your opinion, do their children have private lives
or have they been forced into the spotlight based on nothing but who
their parents happen to be?

Hello Razer,
I actually don't disagree with you at all. I  agree with the
"transparency for the powerful, privacy for the weak" mindset that is so
ingrained in cypherpunk culture. I was just wondering where we draw the
line between the powerful and the weak.
There is no doubt in my mind that the criminals currently running for
government positions in the U.S. are powerful, and therefore need
transparency, but this brings about a few questions in my mind. Is one
powerful because they are related to someone who is powerful? If so, at
what point does the relation become "too distant" for someone to be
considered powerful? Is there something other than money or political
power that can be considered a source of power? These are just
considerations I want to think through, and I was wondering what your
take on it was.
My question was honestly not meant as a critique of your viewpoint, just
a clarification so I can think these ideas through. I'm sorry if it
offended you.
To answer your question directly: No, that's not unreasonable. I agree
with you on it entirely. I just want to consider the implications of
things such as family relationships, and where the lines are drawn.

Thanks for the reply! I will consider these things.
The only thing that worries me is the proposal that we use the same
criteria as the people we are claiming to be criminals. Implicate the
whole family for the sins of one... It just don't seem like an
improvement to me. It implies that people who are born to privilege are
incapable of seeing the problems with the system and escaping it. I'm
not sure that's the best way, but at the moment I don't yet have an
alternative, so I will just think about it for a while.

I have to start thinking about funding soon. I better start making
brownies and selling them in places where people would care about my
research! I'm really not interested in taking dirty DoD money or
something like that.
