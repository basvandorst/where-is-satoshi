@_subject: [cryptography] Sodium: NaCl repackaged for portability/ease-of-use 
Hello crypto-people,
Frank Denis just announced Sodium, a fork of NaCl containing only the
reference C code, packaged using a standard autotools build system:
NaCl has traditionally been hard to use because it targets *IX exclusively
and the assembly versions of the various algorithms are not PIC yet. For
this reason there are a lot of issues making NaCl work portably (e.g.
across 32-bit/64-bit platforms, let alone Windows)
Sodium is designed to be portable, easy to compile/package, and it even
works on Windows!
Some might think this undermines some of the original goals of NaCl,
however djb has suggested it as an option in the past:

I believe it's technically called the Deep Web, at least according to CSI
