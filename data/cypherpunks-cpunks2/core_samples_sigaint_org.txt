The case of 97% of climate scientists agreeing that human beings are the
main cause of warming.
One of the main papers behind the 97 percent claim is authored by John Cook:
Quantifying the Consensus on Anthropogenic Global Warming in the
Scientific Literature
Here is Cooks summary of his paper: Cook et al. (2013) found that over
97 percent [of papers he surveyed] endorsed the view that the Earth is
warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause.
A quick scan of the paper reveals that this is not the case.
Cook is able to demonstrate only that a relative handful endorse the view
that the Earth is warming up and human emissions of greenhouse gases are
the main cause. Cook calls this explicit endorsement with
quantification (quantification meaning 50 percent or more). Only a small
percentage of the papers fall into this category; Cook does not say what
percentage but when the study was publicly challenged by economist David
Friedman, one observer calculated that only 1.6 percent explicitly stated
that man-made greenhouse gases caused at least 50 percent of global
Where did most of the 97 percent come from ?
Cook had created a category called explicit endorsement without
quantification  that is, papers in which the author, by Cooks
admission, did not say whether 1 percent or 50 percent or 100 percent of
the warming was caused by man.
He had also created a category called implicit endorsement, for papers
that imply (but dont say) that there is some man-made global warming and
dont quantify it. In other words, he created two categories that he
labeled as endorsing a view that they most certainly didnt.
Scientists whose papers were classified by Cook protested:
Cook survey included 10 of my 122 eligible papers. 5/10 were rated
incorrectly. 4/5 were rated as endorse rather than neutral.
Dr. Richard Tol
That is not an accurate representation of my paper . . .
Dr. Craig Idso
Nope . . . it is not an accurate representation.
Dr. Nir Shaviv
Cook et al. (2013) is based on a strawman argument . . .
Dr. Nicola Scafetta
Think about how many times you hear that 97 percent or some similar figure
thrown around. Its based on crude manipulation propagated by people whose
ideological agenda it serves.
And peep the core samples, son !
