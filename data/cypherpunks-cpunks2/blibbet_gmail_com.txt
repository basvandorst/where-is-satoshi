Intel has a 3-day UEFI training course for employes/partners. They put their courseware and labs online, and recent builds work with Linux and not just Windows/VisualStudio. Targets IHV audience, not security-centric.
The above-mentioned Butterworth recently spoke at Perdue on BIOS security:
If you're in the Seatle area I'll be doing another half-day dev intro to UEFI at the local univerisity capture-the-flag team in March, and I think non-students are welcome to attend.

There's a mostly-annual semantic technology conference called STIDS
(Semantic Technology for Intelligence, Defense, and Security), formerly
called OIC (Ontologies for the Intelligence Community). First day is
public, second day is secret. Focuses on using semantic network
technologies for national security issues.
The list of sponsors and vendors, and most of the presentations are
from companies talking about how well their products work, are useful
to find out companies that analyze various metadata. It's funny how many
are based on open source technologies, like Semantic MediaWiki. :-)

Hello free phone lovers,
As we all know, the baseband/modem/radio processor is the big bone in
our collective throat: it is the most closed and proprietary part of
every currently available phone, no matter how free the rest of the
phone might be.
Well, without beating further around the bush, I just started a
crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo seeking to change this bleak
baseband situation:
My project seeks to solve the problem of the closed and proprietary
baseband by producing a GSM modem module that will run 100% free
firmware.  And furthermore, I seek to produce such a free baseband not
by creating it from scratch, but by re-creating one that was already
made by someone else some years ago and later discontinued.  Please
read the campaign page for the full details.
Thanks for reading,

I'm trying to get computer reviews to include more useful information,
mainly about checking about known firmware vulnerabilities using Intel
CHIPSEC (or MITRE/LegbaCore Copernicus for Windows).
If you know of anyone that does reviews for a living, please forward it
to them. I need help with that, I don't have any contacts at review sites.
If you've recently bought a new Intel-based system , and it fails
CHIPSEC, please let others know about it, so other consumers can avoid
that broken hardware.
If you work at a company where your purchases have more influence to
OEMs than a single citizen, please help by demanding CHIPSEC results
before purchase, to help make OEMs deliver better systems.
Thanks very much!

fresh hardware and I'll post blog entries on them. On Twitter use and/or  I don't know how to use Facebook. If you blog on it, let

I wish someone would create a site where users could upload their
CHIPSEC report logs, and site would enable people to query all of the
uploaded results.
BTW, sorry my blog looks sucky, I still haven't learned WordPress and
that's the default theme. Working on it. Will have static HTML files on

@_subject: Linux Foundation' Linux workstation security checklist 
Since the Linux Foundation advise is recommending UEFI and Secure Boot
and TPMs,
I think they should also recommend running Intel CHIPSEC -- directly or
via LUV-live -- for firmware vulnerability analysis, at least on the
Intel systems (AMD has no CHIPSEC port). If system was designed
vulnerable by vendor, there's little point in bothering with Secure Boot
or any OS-level hardening....
Guidance should probably enable Verified Boot when running Chrome,
perhaps the Verified U-Boot and other secure coreboot/U-Boot
The advise should also mention something about each distro's Secure Boot
varies in strength, some allow unsigned kernel drivers to be loaded even
if Secure Boot is enabled.
It should mention virtual firmware security (inside VirtualBox, QEMU,
etc), especially after last BlackHat talk:
There's more to do, taking snapshots of rom, scanning for changes,
tracking vendor firmware updates, ensuring system has fresh firmware
bits, etc. But it's a nice start.
AFAIK, RMS uses an IBM Thinkpad retrofitted with LibreBoot (presumably
using SeaBIOS BIOS clone).
I don't think RMS is responsible for LF's IT security policies. :-)
If someone has one of these old Thinkpads boxes (sold by "Ministry of
Freedom" (formerly trading as Gluglug), please try to run CHIPSEC on it;
if it runs, run chipsec_main.py to see if it passes the security tess. I
don't expect CHIPSEC will recognize the ancient Intel chipset used by
the old IBM Thinkpad. It'd probably take someone to update CHIPSEC to
add system data for this old chipsec, in order to make it work. Perhaps
Ministry of Freedom has a vested interest? :-)
Potential insecurely-built IBM system firmware security aside, I don't
think Libreboot nor SeaBIOS offers much in terms of security to stop
attackers, as well. U-Boot and coreboot both have PKI-enabled boot
flavors that're vaguely like UEFI's Secure Boot, which Ministry of
Freedom could be using, to help secure their modern customers.

FlashROM should be able to help. Does anyone know if these are BIOS-era
OptionROM- based, or UEFI-based drivers? If they are UEFI drivers, the
UEFI Dev Kit (UDK) tools can help.
RANT: This recent event is an example of why OEMs/IHVs/IBVs need to
treat firmware more like software and not like silicon. We *NEED* SCAP
OVAL definitions SCAP CVEs, ChangeLogs/ReadMes with feature/bug deltas.
These days, there is no excuse, CoreBoot and UEFI(TianoCore.org) are
open source projects, not the ancient monolithic BIOS codebase with
ancient OpROM blobs. All existing blobs that OEMs/IHVs release should be
signs, and have a CRL/OSCP URL for updates. There needs to be a public
registry of these BIOS OpROM blobs and UEFI binaries. We need a vendor
neutral logo that lists detalis about firmware, not rely on MSFT to
drive Windows OEMs to only do what MSFT wants; and we need Consumer
Reports to track this data about systems. Most importantly, OEMs need to
build systems which enable users to install their own firmware, like
users do today with OS software.

@_subject: [Cryptography] trojans in the firmware 
If this firmware trojan is EFI-based:
For PCI-based devices, use an Intel Tunnel Mountain box, an EFI dev box.
You can install a debug version of the firmware with symbols or
full-source level debug info, and debug it with a second machine using
GDB or Windbg.
For USB-based devices, use an Intel Minnowboard MAX, a low-end dev board
for 'hobbiests'/'hackers' for Yocto and UEFI. Much cheaper than the
Tunnel Mtn box.
Consider trying to use QEMU to test a virtual drivers for native
passthru. QEMU has the best diagnostic options for UEFI, it is the UEFI
Forum's main virtualization option for EFI dev. You can build the same
kind of debug firmware image for QEMU (called OVMF) as with live box.
VirtualBox has some EFI support, especially when you build it with
custom flags and set some environment variables. But AFAIK, VirtualBox's
EFI support is less powerful than QEMUs.
If malware vendor provided ARM OpROMs in addition to Intel ones, use one

offer much"?
I merely meant that BIOS didn't offer new security tech, that newer
firmware tech does. My point was that Verified coreboot is stronger than
Libreboot, and Ministry of Freedom could be using stronger open source
tech in their product than they currently do. Eg, coreboot has Verified
Boot mode, which is roughly like UEFI's Secure Boot, and can help
protect the a blob-free system more than just Libreboot.
Yes, building your own code is great, if you're able to do so. Building
a stock BIOS with no security is great, but a stock BIOS won't stop
attackers. Users should not have to rebuild their refurbished firmware
to make it better, the vendor should offer that.
Fear of blobs is one thing, fear of firmware attacks are another. Blobs
are a great place for malware to hide, so there is an obvious
relationship, but some freedom/privacy-loving users often seem to only
focus on getting rid of blobs, and not pay much attention to the
security of their firmware.  My concern about Purism is that they'll
disable enough security features to reduce the amount of FSP blobs such
that the system is more attractive to attackers than normal PCs.
Having an ancient laptop may help. Attackers may not be able to use
CHIPSEC's HAL, that's the positive side of not being able to use CHIPSEC
to test your defenses. :-) But there are alternatives to CHIPSEC's HAL,
and they're less strict about chipsec support, and will likely work on
old Thinkpads.
Recently someone ported a modern ARM-based Chromebook (ASUS C201, Veyron
Speedy) to use Libreboot, w/o blobs. That's another alternative to old
x86 systems, with different attacks. I'm not sure what's safer, ARM or
x86 these days. x86 BIOS/UEFI attackers are well-documented by
researchers, but ARM-based ones are less so, AFAICT. I'm unclear what's
safer from attackers, an old x86, or a modern ARM or AMD system.
Blob-free and secure, that's my goal. BIOS -- even Libreboot's SeaBIOS

Regardless of the way the marketing team is spinning things, they
supposedly have 3 firmware developers trying to make a difference.
Outside Bunnie Studios, I don't know of another OEM that is trying to
help with this niche market with new hardware (not including refurbished
Thinkpads). So I respect that effort. Not sure they'll fully succeed in
this model, but perhaps a few models later they will have some decent boxes.
It sounds like they have a source license to Intel's Firmware Support
Package (FSP), and are modifying it to disable some silicon/firmware
features. The results will still be closed-source.
Today, nearly all Intel systems are 100% closed-source firmware, via
IBVs (Phoenix, AMI, Insyde, and OEMs). Some AMD and ARM systems could
provide blob-free firmware. If used in conjunction with fully open
source OS/app stack, then you might be able to trust it.
Today, I don't see how you can trust any keys/certs in any of the
Trusted/Verified/Measured/etc boots, most of the solutions don't seem to
have any way for the owner/user to verify, eg, no CRL/OSCP keys. My
reading of NIST SP80-147's seems to imply that sysadmins need to be able
to verify things, but that doesn't seem viable today.
While Purism's marketing may be a bit overboard, I'm hopeful that
they're trying. Maybe their next model will use the new RISC-V Raven3
chip, with U-Boot Verified Boot, and ship with full source to
CPU/firmware/enclosure, firmware, OS, and apps. To get to that point,
we'll probably need to help them fund this current Intel model, to keep
Purism alive....
I am not sure why they they need to create yet-another privacy-centric
OS, PureOS, and focus on improving and using Qubes/TAILs/Trisqel/Mempo/etc.
They're apparently working on a Free Software fork of FSP. I wish this
was a shared effort with many more free software developers, perhaps
managed by FSF or Linux Foundation, not just a single OEM. More than one
Linux OEM could benefit from such an effort, most of them still use COTS
100% closed-source IBVs.
Can the current Intel-based solution get certified by the FSF
RespectYourFreedom program? I'm not sure.
Whatever happens with what they do to the FSP and Intel silicon, if the
result is less secure to attackers, that'll be an issue. Many who care
about personal freedom and detest blobs seem to ignore security. But
Purism cares about privacy and security, so they have to try and deal
with both issues. Disabling BootGuard in updated FSP may make it more
configurable, but less secure, it seems. Their web site has fancy
graphics and tables. I hope they create a list of FSP modifications so
we can see what security holes the system may have.
I like the kill switch. I'd go further: since many firmware attacks come
through suspend/resume, I'd rather just disable that at the HW/FW/OS
levels. I'd like to have a fully-lockable enclosure in a laptop, which
can cover exposed ports, with a good quality lock, in a metal enclosure.
Of course, it would't be able to make it through TSA customs, so
probably not commercially viable. :-(
If I worked there, I'd tone down the marketing a bit (they have blobs in
their firmware, and they're based on an Intel system, they'll never
satisfy some of their potential market), perhaps focus on hardware that
can be built with blob-free firmware for their next model. And I'd hire
LegbaCore to evaluate the hardware before they ship it, for security
issues. :-)
Looking forward to their next model!

I agree, the FSF RSF program could do more to work OEMs/IHVs and get the
message out about their program. But while GPL/GNU platform is nice, RMS
doesn't seem to care for Open Source Hardware, just Free Software, so
I'm not sure FSF RSF program can be the only source of guidance for
OEMs/IHVs. FSF has nearly no specific OEM/IHV advice for "Free
Hardware". Except to make it GPLv3. It seems to me that OSHWA doesn't
seem to focus on firmware, nor -- it seems to me -- much for business
systems. The other open hardware group also doesn't seem to doing much
in this area.  Today, the main org focusing on 'open hardware' for
enterprise systems appears to be Open Compute Project, which is
currently a UEFI-centric project. No citizen-centric,

Not trying to dis old refurbished x86s. Just pointing out a specific
area to investigate w/r/t older x86 hardware. Joanna's tweet was one
specfic case to look into. Pre-CHIPSEC, it is less clear to me.  I wish
I had a complete list of issues (i.e., the set of things to write for a
CHIPSEC test profile for that hardware).
Old Thinkpads are great, but a LIMITED resource, we can't just rely on
old hardware forever.
I wonder if Cyrix/Via/Transmeta/etc clones are also viable to be
refurbished by Ministry of Freedom, and have any chance of being secure?
I also wonder about MIPS and SunSPARC chips, they have some old boxes to
refurbish, as well as some new MIPS boxes (a recent Chinese one not only
runs MIPS but also x86 and ARM instructions!).
If I were to hold out hope for an ISA that might be trustworthy, it
would be the RISC-V. But that'll take a year or longer. The Raven3 board
just came out, shown at HotChips. I hope that's the chip that Purism
uses for their next laptop, along with the recent Open Hardware GPU,
also announced at HotChips. Until then, I can update my own firmware on
my ARM dev boards, and -- sans FSP blobs -- on Intel dev boards. And I
have an ancient -- i.e., unknown security profile --- x86 with
Libreboot. Wish Libreboot used coreboot's Verifed Boot, for a bit more
protection, but that can be patched.
Not sure about Win10. I've heard they have a freeware version, which is
ad-sponsored, which must be be fun. Ubuntu, or as a friend of mine calls
them, "Spybuntu", has been abusing privacy for years. I wouldn't ever
trust an OS which is run by a single company. Debian isn't run by a
single company. It isn't perfect, but has fewer than most. Does anyone
have any opinion of Mempo, compared to QubesOS? I haven't used it yet,
but it looks interesting. Qubes is great for Intel systems, but what
about non-Intel, eg, ARM, does their isolation tech scale to non-Intel
ISAs? If not, what OS should ARM users use? (Purism recently tweeted
that they're going to get their PureOS to use parts of QubesOS.
I don't presume to have a trustworthy or secure firmware, on any Intel
box, perhaps AMD box, maybe ARM boxes. (The latter two seem to have less
security research than Intel x86/x64 systems, if anyone has good
pointers to ARM/AMD and other modern non-Intel HW, please speak up.)

Sigh, I meant to say "Free Hardware", not "Free Software" above....
My comment was based on last time I saw video of RMS talk about
hardware, ignored existing HW licensing, and only mentioned his newer
Free Hardware concept. No mention to existing Open Source Hardare
(OSHWA) license, just mentioned GPL. I wonder if there's any way FSF can
work WITH OSHWA and not ignore them. I'm worried that if the Free HW and
Open HW divide, that's fewer resources in tiny non-Closed HW niche. It
seems they're the BSD of hardware, and you can just declare them Free
and GPL them when you touch it.
IMO, FSF could do with a lot more clear Free Hardware guidance to
OEMs/IHVs, including RYF. I hope FSF, Linux Foundation, and others get
serious about funding it. Most OEMs/IHVs won't touch GPL hardware, they
still use the IP model, and blobs are normal to them.
I'd LOVE to see a press release from FSF and OSHWA saying they're
working together to create a spectrum of non-closed hardware, from Open
Source Hardware Association-licensed HW to GPL-licensed Free Hardware,
getting OSHWA to back the FSF RYF program. Perhaps come up with a logo
that clarifies Closed/Open/Free nature of the HW, as well as mentioning
the firmware it uses.
I should be seeing regular, weekly spam from FSF reminding people to
fund a variety of new CrowdSupply.com-funded hardware, like USBArmory,
Novena, and other hardware. I recall seeing one press release from FSF
asking for Replicant help; OSMOCOMBB or an SDR equivalent is needed. A
wifi solution is needed. Right now, it seems the org leading the way for
Open/Free Hardware designs is the Open Compute Project, and it is only
targeting enterprise hardware, no privacy-respecting hardware. Community
is offering little advise to vendors, as previous post in thread
suggested. Someone from FSF should give a talk on Free Hardware at
Embedded Linux Conference, HotChips, and other places where OEMs/IHVs

Not trying to dis old refurbished x86s. Just pointing out a specific
area to investigate w/r/t older x86 hardware. Joanna's tweet was one
specfic case to look into. Pre-CHIPSEC, it is less clear to me.  I wish
I had a complete list of issues (i.e., the set of things to write for a
CHIPSEC test profile for that hardware).
Old Thinkpads are great, but a LIMITED resource, we can't just rely on
old hardware forever.
I wonder if Cyrix/Via/Transmeta/etc clones are also viable to be
refurbished by Ministry of Freedom, and have any chance of being secure?
I also wonder about MIPS and SunSPARC chips, they have some old boxes to
refurbish, as well as some new MIPS boxes (a recent Chinese one not only
runs MIPS but also x86 and ARM instructions!).
If I were to hold out hope for an ISA that might be trustworthy, it
would be the RISC-V. But that'll take a year or longer. The Raven3 board
just came out, shown at HotChips. I hope that's the chip that Purism
uses for their next laptop, along with the recent Open Hardware GPU,
also announced at HotChips. Until then, I can update my own firmware on
my ARM dev boards, and -- sans FSP blobs -- on Intel dev boards. And I
have an ancient -- i.e., unknown security profile --- x86 with
Libreboot. Wish Libreboot used coreboot's Verifed Boot, for a bit more
protection, but that can be patched.
Not sure about Win10. I've heard they have a freeware version, which is
ad-sponsored, which must be be fun. Ubuntu, or as a friend of mine calls
them, "Spybuntu", has been abusing privacy for years. I wouldn't ever
trust an OS which is run by a single company. Debian isn't run by a
single company. It isn't perfect, but has fewer than most. Does anyone
have any opinion of Mempo, compared to QubesOS? I haven't used it yet,
but it looks interesting. Qubes is great for Intel systems, but what
about non-Intel, eg, ARM, does their isolation tech scale to non-Intel
ISAs? If not, what OS should ARM users use? (Purism recently tweeted
that they're going to get their PureOS to use parts of QubesOS.
I don't presume to have a trustworthy or secure firmware, on any Intel
box, perhaps AMD box, maybe ARM boxes. (The latter two seem to have less
security research than Intel x86/x64 systems, if anyone has good
pointers to ARM/AMD and other modern non-Intel HW, please speak up.)

Sigh, I meant to say "Free Hardware", not "Free Software" above....
My comment was based on last time I saw video of RMS talk about
hardware, ignored existing HW licensing, and only mentioned his newer
Free Hardware concept. No mention to existing Open Source Hardare
(OSHWA) license, just mentioned GPL. I wonder if there's any way FSF can
work WITH OSHWA and not ignore them. I'm worried that if the Free HW and
Open HW divide, that's fewer resources in tiny non-Closed HW niche. It
seems they're the BSD of hardware, and you can just declare them Free
and GPL them when you touch it.
IMO, FSF could do with a lot more clear Free Hardware guidance to
OEMs/IHVs, including RYF. I hope FSF, Linux Foundation, and others get
serious about funding it. Most OEMs/IHVs won't touch GPL hardware, they
still use the IP model, and blobs are normal to them.
I'd LOVE to see a press release from FSF and OSHWA saying they're
working together to create a spectrum of non-closed hardware, from Open
Source Hardware Association-licensed HW to GPL-licensed Free Hardware,
getting OSHWA to back the FSF RYF program. Perhaps come up with a logo
that clarifies Closed/Open/Free nature of the HW, as well as mentioning
the firmware it uses.
I should be seeing regular, weekly spam from FSF reminding people to
fund a variety of new CrowdSupply.com-funded hardware, like USBArmory,
Novena, and other hardware. I recall seeing one press release from FSF
asking for Replicant help; OSMOCOMBB or an SDR equivalent is needed. A
wifi solution is needed. Right now, it seems the org leading the way for
Open/Free Hardware designs is the Open Compute Project, and it is only
targeting enterprise hardware, no privacy-respecting hardware. Community
is offering little advise to vendors, as previous post in thread

offer much"?
I merely meant that BIOS didn't offer new security tech, that newer
firmware tech does. My point was that Verified coreboot is stronger than
Libreboot, and Ministry of Freedom could be using stronger open source
tech in their product than they currently do. Eg, coreboot has Verified
Boot mode, which is roughly like UEFI's Secure Boot, and can help
protect the a blob-free system more than just Libreboot.
Yes, building your own code is great, if you're able to do so. Building
a stock BIOS with no security is great, but a stock BIOS won't stop
attackers. Users should not have to rebuild their refurbished firmware
to make it better, the vendor should offer that.
Fear of blobs is one thing, fear of firmware attacks are another. Blobs
are a great place for malware to hide, so there is an obvious
relationship, but some freedom/privacy-loving users often seem to only
focus on getting rid of blobs, and not pay much attention to the
security of their firmware.  My concern about Purism is that they'll
disable enough security features to reduce the amount of FSP blobs such
that the system is more attractive to attackers than normal PCs.
Having an ancient laptop may help. Attackers may not be able to use
CHIPSEC's HAL, that's the positive side of not being able to use CHIPSEC
to test your defenses. :-) But there are alternatives to CHIPSEC's HAL,
and they're less strict about chipsec support, and will likely work on
old Thinkpads.
Recently someone ported a modern ARM-based Chromebook (ASUS C201, Veyron
Speedy) to use Libreboot, w/o blobs. That's another alternative to old
x86 systems, with different attacks. I'm not sure what's safer, ARM or
x86 these days. x86 BIOS/UEFI attackers are well-documented by
researchers, but ARM-based ones are less so, AFAICT. I'm unclear what's
safer from attackers, an old x86, or a modern ARM or AMD system.
Blob-free and secure, that's my goal. BIOS -- even Libreboot's SeaBIOS

Regardless of the way the marketing team is spinning things, they
supposedly have 3 firmware developers trying to make a difference.
Outside Bunnie Studios, I don't know of another OEM that is trying to
help with this niche market with new hardware (not including refurbished
Thinkpads). So I respect that effort. Not sure they'll fully succeed in
this model, but perhaps a few models later they will have some decent boxes.
It sounds like they have a source license to Intel's Firmware Support
Package (FSP), and are modifying it to disable some silicon/firmware
features. The results will still be closed-source.
Today, nearly all Intel systems are 100% closed-source firmware, via
IBVs (Phoenix, AMI, Insyde, and OEMs). Some AMD and ARM systems could
provide blob-free firmware. If used in conjunction with fully open
source OS/app stack, then you might be able to trust it.
Today, I don't see how you can trust any keys/certs in any of the
Trusted/Verified/Measured/etc boots, most of the solutions don't seem to
have any way for the owner/user to verify, eg, no CRL/OSCP keys. My
reading of NIST SP80-147's seems to imply that sysadmins need to be able
to verify things, but that doesn't seem viable today.
While Purism's marketing may be a bit overboard, I'm hopeful that
they're trying. Maybe their next model will use the new RISC-V Raven3
chip, with U-Boot Verified Boot, and ship with full source to
CPU/firmware/enclosure, firmware, OS, and apps. To get to that point,
we'll probably need to help them fund this current Intel model, to keep
Purism alive....
I am not sure why they they need to create yet-another privacy-centric
OS, PureOS, and focus on improving and using Qubes/TAILs/Trisqel/Mempo/etc.
They're apparently working on a Free Software fork of FSP. I wish this
was a shared effort with many more free software developers, perhaps
managed by FSF or Linux Foundation, not just a single OEM. More than one
Linux OEM could benefit from such an effort, most of them still use COTS
100% closed-source IBVs.
Can the current Intel-based solution get certified by the FSF
RespectYourFreedom program? I'm not sure.
Whatever happens with what they do to the FSP and Intel silicon, if the
result is less secure to attackers, that'll be an issue. Many who care
about personal freedom and detest blobs seem to ignore security. But
Purism cares about privacy and security, so they have to try and deal
with both issues. Disabling BootGuard in updated FSP may make it more
configurable, but less secure, it seems. Their web site has fancy
graphics and tables. I hope they create a list of FSP modifications so
we can see what security holes the system may have.
I like the kill switch. I'd go further: since many firmware attacks come
through suspend/resume, I'd rather just disable that at the HW/FW/OS
levels. I'd like to have a fully-lockable enclosure in a laptop, which
can cover exposed ports, with a good quality lock, in a metal enclosure.
Of course, it would't be able to make it through TSA customs, so
probably not commercially viable. :-(
If I worked there, I'd tone down the marketing a bit (they have blobs in
their firmware, and they're based on an Intel system, they'll never
satisfy some of their potential market), perhaps focus on hardware that
can be built with blob-free firmware for their next model. And I'd hire
LegbaCore to evaluate the hardware before they ship it, for security
issues. :-)
Looking forward to their next model!

I agree, the FSF RSF program could do more to work OEMs/IHVs and get the
message out about their program. But while GPL/GNU platform is nice, RMS
doesn't seem to care for Open Source Hardware, just Free Software, so
I'm not sure FSF RSF program can be the only source of guidance for
OEMs/IHVs. FSF has nearly no specific OEM/IHV advice for "Free
Hardware". Except to make it GPLv3. It seems to me that OSHWA doesn't
seem to focus on firmware, nor -- it seems to me -- much for business
systems. The other open hardware group also doesn't seem to doing much
in this area.  Today, the main org focusing on 'open hardware' for
enterprise systems appears to be Open Compute Project, which is
currently a UEFI-centric project. No citizen-centric,
privacy+security-centric profile in OCP.
I agree, FOSS OS vendors -- Linux Foundation, FreeBSD Foundation, etc.

Yes, I *really* wish there were more AMD64/ARM32/ARM64 experts, most
seem to focus on x86/x64. Even at AMD and ARM.
If Linaro finishes porting LUV-live (including BITS, CHIPSEC, FWTS) from
Intel to AArch64, CHIPSEC will run on ARM, and the UEFI tests will work,
but there won't be any new ARM64-centric security tests, as the few
dozen Intel-centric ones won't apply to ARM boxes. We need some
arch-centric security experts to create a list of security tests, like
Intel ATR team does with chipsec_main security modules.
One interesting thing about AMD64 is -- *I think* -- that some boards
have blob-free options in the coreboot tree, not relying on AGESA
binaries. That is something, for the blob-concerned community. Fewer
blobs than Intel FSP. Unclear which models, and which branches of the
coreboot tree to look at, and if any of those models have modern
supplies of hardware, or are ancient.
There *are* blob-free ports of Libreboot to modern ARM boxes, some
Chromebooks. And Olimex is apparently working on an ARM64 open source
chip, and laptop, that might be interesting.
Also, the SeaBIOS project is adding TPM and other security features in
recently, it'll be interesting to see that BIOS added to some Libreboot
and other systems, for security + configurability, not just the latter.
Hopefully 2016 will get some OEM to bring us a Stateless x86 Laptop, and

Joanna's recent Stateless x86 Laptop also addresses this, chapter 7:
The physical protections mentioned above do not, however, resolve the
of the attackers subverting the laptop hardware at manufacturing or shipment
stages. This includes, naturally, a potentially conspiring laptop vendor.
In order to address this latter problem we – the industry – need to come up
with reliable and simple methods for comparing PCBs with each other. A tool
analogical to ‘diff’, only working for PCBs rather than on files. Such a
implemented as a software, could e.g. take two (sets of) photos taken by the
user of the two boards to compare. The photos might be taken with an
camera, or, in a more sophisticated setup, using X-ray imaging to reveal
also the
internal layer wiring. This inititive has already been proposed by other
recently (e.g. [3]), so it is not unreasonable to expect some progress
in this area
in the near future.
Admittedly such an approach would not be able to detect sophisticated
which replace the original laptop board with identically looking one
and chip-geometry-wise), yet with different chips. The author thinks
that such
attacks might be very difficult to pull off in practice, probably
extremely pricey
due to the need of manufacturing small series of custom integrated circuits.

Yes, USB Armories are nice. But they're like a dev board, not a laptop.
What I think we need is for Cyperpunk community to join Open Compute
Project and define the Stateless Laptop. A fat, modular laptop that let
you swap out the Intel/ARM dev board of the year, with a USB Armory or
Arduino or other device to act as IPMI BMC. Like the modularity of
blades/racks, but at the laptop level, like old laptops had bays where
you could put in optical drive or battery or hard drive. Maybe multiple
boards, like a cluster of RPI2s. OCP is for enterprises to build cheap
enterprise hardware, there is no effort to build a privacy/secure
citizen-focused device profile for OEMs to use.
Except UEFI is an option for ARM as well.
For AArch32, I presume it's used by APPL/MSFT/other vendors as a form of
DRM to keep others from removing their OS choice from their HW.
On AArch64, apparently it is there because server admins expect the UEFI
pre-OS env for servers, and AArch64 wants to get into the server market.
But unlike x86, UEFI is optional, U-Boot and coreboot are other options.
Linaro offers both UEFI and U-Boot, their UEFI is a fork of Tianocore,
with more ARM updates. I've not studied it closely, but I think there
are multiple blob-free ARM UEFI implemenations, at least in the Linaro
dev boards supported, and you can update the firmware on most dev boards.
Linaro is porting CHIPSEC to ARM (AArch64), as part of their port of LUV
(Linux UEFI Validation). CHIPSEC and BITS are not ported yet.
There is a lot of ARM/UEFI development going on in Linux and even
FreeBSD, UEFI is not Intel-centric.
I used to think that U-Boot was ARM-centric, but it also has Intel
support now. So coreboot, U-Boot, and UEFI are all options for both
Intel and ARM.
Last week at the RISC-V workshop, I hear that someone has already (or is
porting) UEFI to RISC-V.
Personally, I like CHIPSEC. It is a firmware vulnerability tool. Without
this tool, it'd be a lot harder to determine security profile of a
device. I wish it was available on other chips (and had chip-centric
security tests so it was useful). I wish CHIPSEC was available for
coreboot and U-Boot, not just BIOS and UEFI.

The blob-free AMD systems are the ones supported prior to this 2014 date
mentioned in the Phoronix and Libreboot FAQ entries below. Current AMD
appears to be binary-only AGESA. AFAICT, if you want a blob-free AGESA,
l look for AMD models targeted in the source drops before that 2014
cutoff. It would be really useful to know if any of those devices are in
current product, or are only on EBay.
I think it'll be easier to find new Libreboot candidates from the new
ARM-based Chromebooks, instead of focusing on Intel/AMD.
AMD (and Intel) aside, and are there any other x86/x64-compatible
vendors out there, like Transmeta?
"In 2011, AMD started cooperating with the coreboot project, releasing
this as source code under a free license. In 2014, they stopped
releasing source code and started releasing AGESA as binary blobs
instead. This makes AGESA now equivalent to Intel FSP."
"More worrying about the prospects for Coreboot on future hardware is
that since the end of 2014, AMD stopped providing open-source AGESA
code. AGESA releases by AMD are now binary-only, with this being the
bootstrap protocol needed to initialize AMD processor cores, memory, and
HyperTransport. Binary AGESA is similar to Intel not opening up their
firmware support packages. "

seem to focus on x86/x64. Even at AMD and ARM.
If Linaro finishes porting LUV-live (including BITS, CHIPSEC, FWTS) from
Intel to AArch64, CHIPSEC will run on ARM, and the UEFI tests will work,
but there won't be any new ARM64-centric security tests, as the few
dozen Intel-centric ones won't apply to ARM boxes. We need some
arch-centric security experts to create a list of security tests, like
Intel ATR team does with chipsec_main security modules.
One interesting thing about AMD64 is -- *I think* -- that some boards
have blob-free options in the coreboot tree, not relying on AGESA
binaries. That is something, for the blob-concerned community. Fewer
blobs than Intel FSP. Unclear which models, and which branches of the
coreboot tree to look at, and if any of those models have modern
supplies of hardware, or are ancient.
There *are* blob-free ports of Libreboot to modern ARM boxes, some
Chromebooks. And Olimex is apparently working on an ARM64 open source
chip, and laptop, that might be interesting.
Also, the SeaBIOS project is adding TPM and other security features in
recently, it'll be interesting to see that BIOS added to some Libreboot
and other systems, for security + configurability, not just the latter.
Hopefully 2016 will get some OEM to bring us a Stateless x86 Laptop, and
a RISC-V-based laptop. And more Novenas.

Joanna's recent Stateless x86 Laptop also addresses this, chapter 7:
The physical protections mentioned above do not, however, resolve the
of the attackers subverting the laptop hardware at manufacturing or shipment
stages. This includes, naturally, a potentially conspiring laptop vendor.
In order to address this latter problem we – the industry – need to come up
with reliable and simple methods for comparing PCBs with each other. A tool
analogical to ‘diff’, only working for PCBs rather than on files. Such a
implemented as a software, could e.g. take two (sets of) photos taken by the
user of the two boards to compare. The photos might be taken with an
camera, or, in a more sophisticated setup, using X-ray imaging to reveal
also the
internal layer wiring. This inititive has already been proposed by other
recently (e.g. [3]), so it is not unreasonable to expect some progress
in this area
in the near future.
Admittedly such an approach would not be able to detect sophisticated
which replace the original laptop board with identically looking one
and chip-geometry-wise), yet with different chips. The author thinks
that such
attacks might be very difficult to pull off in practice, probably
extremely pricey
due to the need of manufacturing small series of custom integrated circuits.

Yes, USB Armories are nice. But they're like a dev board, not a laptop.
What I think we need is for Cyperpunk community to join Open Compute
Project and define the Stateless Laptop. A fat, modular laptop that let
you swap out the Intel/ARM dev board of the year, with a USB Armory or
Arduino or other device to act as IPMI BMC. Like the modularity of
blades/racks, but at the laptop level, like old laptops had bays where
you could put in optical drive or battery or hard drive. Maybe multiple
boards, like a cluster of RPI2s. OCP is for enterprises to build cheap
enterprise hardware, there is no effort to build a privacy/secure
citizen-focused device profile for OEMs to use.
Except UEFI is an option for ARM as well.
For AArch32, I presume it's used by APPL/MSFT/other vendors as a form of
DRM to keep others from removing their OS choice from their HW.
On AArch64, apparently it is there because server admins expect the UEFI
pre-OS env for servers, and AArch64 wants to get into the server market.
But unlike x86, UEFI is optional, U-Boot and coreboot are other options.
Linaro offers both UEFI and U-Boot, their UEFI is a fork of Tianocore,
with more ARM updates. I've not studied it closely, but I think there
are multiple blob-free ARM UEFI implemenations, at least in the Linaro
dev boards supported, and you can update the firmware on most dev boards.
Linaro is porting CHIPSEC to ARM (AArch64), as part of their port of LUV
(Linux UEFI Validation). CHIPSEC and BITS are not ported yet.
There is a lot of ARM/UEFI development going on in Linux and even
FreeBSD, UEFI is not Intel-centric.
I used to think that U-Boot was ARM-centric, but it also has Intel
support now. So coreboot, U-Boot, and UEFI are all options for both
Intel and ARM.
Last week at the RISC-V workshop, I hear that someone has already (or is
porting) UEFI to RISC-V.
Personally, I like CHIPSEC. It is a firmware vulnerability tool. Without
this tool, it'd be a lot harder to determine security profile of a
device. I wish it was available on other chips (and had chip-centric
security tests so it was useful). I wish CHIPSEC was available for
coreboot and U-Boot, not just BIOS and UEFI.

The blob-free AMD systems are the ones supported prior to this 2014 date
mentioned in the Phoronix and Libreboot FAQ entries below. Current AMD
appears to be binary-only AGESA. AFAICT, if you want a blob-free AGESA,
l look for AMD models targeted in the source drops before that 2014
cutoff. It would be really useful to know if any of those devices are in
current product, or are only on EBay.
I think it'll be easier to find new Libreboot candidates from the new
ARM-based Chromebooks, instead of focusing on Intel/AMD.
AMD (and Intel) aside, and are there any other x86/x64-compatible
vendors out there, like Transmeta?
"In 2011, AMD started cooperating with the coreboot project, releasing
this as source code under a free license. In 2014, they stopped
releasing source code and started releasing AGESA as binary blobs
instead. This makes AGESA now equivalent to Intel FSP."
"More worrying about the prospects for Coreboot on future hardware is
that since the end of 2014, AMD stopped providing open-source AGESA
code. AGESA releases by AMD are now binary-only, with this being the
bootstrap protocol needed to initialize AMD processor cores, memory, and
HyperTransport. Binary AGESA is similar to Intel not opening up their
firmware support packages. "

Note that in 2015 Apple hired LegbaCore, so it is likely that Apple's
upcoming firmware/hardware will be a lot more secure (and probably less
flexible, like Windows boxes).
