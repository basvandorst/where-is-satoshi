@_subject: Raspberry pi safe? 
I am saving my pennies to build my pc that will be relatively secure and
Raspberry pi b+
Cell shield add on for above
Prepaid sim (paid in cash)
Bluetooth stick
Wifi stick (looking for one with least security issues but they all seem to
be in bed with Al-Shaitain)
Lcd screen
Sdr transceiver
Punch the security holes that you see or possibly give me better
Thanks for your time

@_subject: Rasp pi security 
Just want a highly mobile, easily connected (ie cellular) netbook. Not
super worried about security but not easily exploitable by a script kiddie.
Which I know that is about my coding level.

@_subject: Bitcoin exchanges. 
Is there and way a person can get their paycheck direct deposit to a
Bitcoin? So instead of a deposit to a checking account it goes to an
exchange that converts it for you? And then is there a good way to access
currency in rural areas?
I have seen a few videos and read overviews but they never get to how to
make it practical for people not in big cities, hell it just doesn't seem
practical at all unless you live near an exchange or are willing to do
credit card transactions that  cost on top of the exchange and make the
currency traceable.
