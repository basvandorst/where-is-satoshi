I like buying a computer in a surprise visit to an apple store or a store that sells windows computers.

If you don’t mind saying, can you say if you are a US citizen?  (Probably)
Do you work on an open source project like TOR?  Do you think they do that because you do development?
I’d love if we build a profile of who they actively perform hardware attacks on.  They likely repeat this on categories of people (TOR devs, employees at CAs, etc.).   Even if you can give a vague category (crypto-currency vs open source file system encryption, etc.)
That one lady on twitter was a TOR dev.
I’d love us to deduce as many patterns as possible, so those people can be incredibly diligent.

@_subject: [Cryptography] What has Bitcoin achieved? 
There will always be some set of benefits to crypto-currencies that won’t exist elsewhere.  So their growth will just happen, no matter what.
The question is just if “centralizers” throw their entrepreneurial citizens in jail, when they build these benefits for fellow citizens.
But even when they do that, it will still grow in other countries and by other entrepreneurs.
Soon it will be illegal to publish open source software in some cases.  That would be the only way to stop a future Satoshi from releasing a next generation of bitcoin.  That is where “centralizers saying no” or “centralizers stopping it” means they must throw people who publish open source software in jail.
