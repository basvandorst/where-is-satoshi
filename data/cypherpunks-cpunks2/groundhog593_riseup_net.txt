Matt DeHart named as third Courage beneficiary
Posted on March 2, 2015
- 30-year-old former US National Guard drone team member and alleged WikiLeaks courier deported/extradited to US less than 24 hours ago after asylum claim declined by Canada
- joins Edward Snowden and Jeremy Hammond as Courage beneficiaries
- Matt’s parents Leann and Paul DeHart say: “We are comforted knowing we do not stand up against the tide alone.”
- Matt DeHart appeared before a judge today in Buffalo and was ordered to be transferred to Tennessee for arraignment.
Courage, the international organisation dedicated to the protection of truth-tellers, has announced that its new beneficiary will be Matt Matt DeHart is a 30-year-old former US National Guard drone team member and alleged WikiLeaks courier who worked with the hactivist group Anonymous. In the last 24 hours, he has been deported/extradited from Canada to the United States to face charges that judges in two countries (the US and Canada) have found to lack credibility. WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange said: “Canada’s actions are shameful. It may as well not have a border.” A few minutes ago Matt DeHart appeared before a judge in Buffalo and was ordered to be transferred to Tennessee for arraignment.
For the past five years, Matt DeHart has been at the centre of a US national security investigation and has experienced extraordinary hardship as a result. In 2010, Matt was detained at the US–Canadian border by FBI agents, who administered an IV (intravenous line) to Matt against his will. They questioned him over several days regarding his military unit, his involvement with Anonymous and WikiLeaks. They denied him access to his lawyer, deprived him of sleep, food and water, and tortured him during this time. Although an FBI report confirms Matt was detained for an “espionage matter” and agents asked him nothing about pornography, Matt was presented with a hastily drafted criminal complaint alleging he solicited nude photos from a teenager in 2008.
WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange stated: “The abuse of the law in DeHart’s case is obvious, shocking and wrong. Matt DeHart and his family have suffered enough.”
On 3 April 2013, Matt and his family crossed the US–Canadian border again, seeking political asylum and protection under the United Nations Convention on Torture. Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Board turned down the family’s claim in February 2015, even though they found no “credible and trustworthy evidence” to support the charges Matt faces.
Courage has accepted Matt as its third beneficiary in order to raise awareness about his case, prevent him from experiencing further mistreatment in detention and to raise urgently needed funds for his legal defence. DeHart’s legal team have confirmed that they intend to launch legal action against the US government as well as defend Matt from the charges he currently faces.
Sarah Harrison, Courage’s Acting Director, said:
The FBI has ruined Matt’s life to cover up what he knew and to punish his support of WikiLeaks and Anonymous. Objective judges have agreed that the child porn charges are a ruse to smear him in pursuit of national security information.
Tor Ekeland, one of Matt’s lawyers, said:
Knowing the Courage Foundation has Matt’s back is a great relief to everyone fighting for his cause. It’s a privilege to work with such an esteemed organisation so committed to the freedom of information, and to know that there is light in the darkness.
Matt’s parents, Paul and Leann DeHart, said in a statement,
We are humbled and grateful for the support of the Courage Foundation. Facing a crisis of tsunami magnitude, we are comforted knowing we do not stand up against the tide alone.
In addition to hosting the defence fund, Courage will publicly advocate for Matt DeHart and build his network of support. A re-launched support website at mattdehart.com will provide regular updates on Matt’s case and raise public awareness about the threats he faces.

@_subject: Questions for Matt DeHart case? 
Oh, damn, Douglas, I'm so glad you are going to be there.
I have some knowledge about this case, having written about parts of it
for Newsweek Magazine in the past
( -- sorry about the
paywall -- I believe I own the copyright now, I think it reverted to me
after 90 days of publication -- so anyone can feel free to re-print the
text of this one and make it more available any way they want).
I'm living in Berlin this year and can't make it to the trial, but if
you need any assistance I can do from a distance, please get in touch. I
have a keen interest in spreading more knowledge about this case.
Questions I'd ask his defense team, if I were there:
Has your client received a fair offer from the prosecution? Did the
prosecution ever address DeHart's allegations of torture in FBI custody?
Has the judge made any ruling or evaluation of those claims of torture?
If DeHart is pleading guilty for failure to appear, should he not
receive credit for time served in immigration detention in Canada? At
the dismissal hearing, why did your team not cite the 2012 case of
vindictive prosecution in that same federal district, against your same
prosecutor, which resulted in charges being dismissed? What will the
rest of Matt DeHart's life look like, after this case?
For his parents (who are lovely people, and will try to help you to the
best of their abilities):
How has standing up for your son changed your lives? What did you grow
up believing about American values and law enforcement? What do you
believe now? Has your son's experience made you activists? What do you
feel are your key causes?
For the prosecutors:
Why the years' long persecution, the violent interrogations, the seizure
of property and threats against family, to take a plea that essentially
amounts to receiving CP from a teenager who took a selfie, (I didn't
even know one could be charged with a crime for the text messages one
merely received these days!), and fleeing the jurisdiction, which is a
new charge stemming from the defendants actions taken after the
aggressive persecution began, and the alleged torture? Doesn't that kind
of make you look like an incompetent prosecutor? Do you think that
DeHart deserves seven years in prison and ten years on the sex registry
and living without a passport and with a criminal record, do you think
that is proportional to what you are now saying happened?
Good luck at the hearing, I hope it goes as well as it can possibly go,
which is: it's going to be terrible.
My heart breaks for this family every time I think of what they have
gone through.

@_subject: Questions for Matt DeHart case? 
Oh, damn, Douglas, I'm so glad you are going to be there.
I have some knowledge about this case, having written about parts of it
for Newsweek Magazine in the past
( -- sorry about the
paywall -- I believe I own the copyright now, I think it reverted to me
after 90 days of publication -- so anyone can feel free to re-print the
text of this one and make it more available any way they want).
I'm living in Berlin this year and can't make it to the trial, but if
you need any assistance I can do from a distance, please get in touch. I
have a keen interest in spreading more knowledge about this case.
Questions I'd ask his defense team, if I were there:
Has your client received a fair offer from the prosecution? Did the
prosecution ever address DeHart's allegations of torture in FBI custody?
Has the judge made any ruling or evaluation of those claims of torture?
If DeHart is pleading guilty for failure to appear, should he not
receive credit for time served in immigration detention in Canada? At
the dismissal hearing, why did your team not cite the 2012 case of
vindictive prosecution in that same federal district, against your same
prosecutor, which resulted in charges being dismissed? What will the
rest of Matt DeHart's life look like, after this case?
For his parents (who are lovely people, and will try to help you to the
best of their abilities):
How has standing up for your son changed your lives? What did you grow
up believing about American values and law enforcement? What do you
believe now? Has your son's experience made you activists? What do you
feel are your key causes?
