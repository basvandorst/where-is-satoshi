@_subject: Cointelegraph: Experts Split on Practical Implications of Quantum 
There seem to be two kinds of Quantum Crypto out there
- the kind that needs a piece of fiber
- the kind that lets you send your photons in free space between ground and satellite.
The former's a very niche application, and doesn't protect you about things like pseudonymity vs contact tracing (because you follow the piece of fiber and see who's at the other end, or follow the money and see who's renting the fiber :-).
It's more useful if your threat model is "Auditors" than "Spies"; otherwise you can send an extra diverse dude with a briefcase handcuffed to their arm for an initial authentication key exchange and then use another layer of Diffie-Hellman for authentication, maybe with an annoyingly long ECC key, while also printing the authentication public key in a classified ad in the NY Times or Pravda or Federal Register.
The latter's "interesting"; I'm skeptical about its usefulness, but haven't looked into it deeply, beyond a quick read of
There seem to be three approaches
- one end-to-end quantum-protected hop (ground to bird to ground)
- two (ground to bird-in-the-middle, bird-in-the-middle to ground)
- two (trusted-bird sends entangled pair, one to Alice, one to Bob)
Approach 1 doesn't appear to exist, approach 2 lets you use two prepare-and-measure channels (meh), approach three could be useful-ish
uses entanglement, but needs a bigger satellite than the bird-in-the-middle approach.  (According to the paper, it needs more than a 100kg satellite, as opposed to a single-end thing which can fit on an under-10kg cubesat.)
