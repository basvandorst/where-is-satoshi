@_subject: British start-up launches 'new internet' 
A UK-based blockchain start-up has revealed what it is calling a new
version of the Internet.
*DADI (Decentralized Architecture for a Democratic Internet)
 *will be faster, cheaper and more secure, but most
importantly – the control over the network won't be in the hands of large
corporations, but rather in those who use it.
The network will be run by its users, who will hook up their devices
(gaming consoles, tablets, laptops, etc) to use their spare power to run
and co-own the network. Almost all of the revenue (85 per cent) will go
back to the users.
Explaining this new approach, DADI founder and CEO Joseph Denne said: “A
vast amount of computational power currently goes unused in homes and
businesses, around the world. Expensive computers, games consoles, set-top
boxes, smart televisions and other devices spend large amounts of their
life unused or in standby mode. And that’s the power we’ll harness for this
new network - drastically reducing reliance on expensive data centres that
harm the environment.”
“In the same way that homeowners can now install solar panels and sell
excess electricity back to the National Grid, the public will be able to
connect their devices in the home to the DADI network - earning passive
income as a contributor and part-owner of a fairer, faster, safer internet.”
