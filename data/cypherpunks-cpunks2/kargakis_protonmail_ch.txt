Yet most Bitcoin users and definitely the rest of people don't how to use cold storage or even what it means.
There is work that needs to be done in order to bring it to the masses.

It's unlike that most Internet users know how BGP works (said elsewhere).

Christ was crucified when he was 33 years old, ie. 33 CE. After they thought he died, he actually came back so I don't know what this piece is trying to debunk.

Not a ready implementation yet but the mimblewimble protocol solves a lot of the scalability issues plagued in other blockchains.

"Came back" as in "ressurected". He likely experienced death on the cross but was able to "come back" at a later point in time (three days they say).
Anyway, I want to make a point here that is you can never prove anything about anything you haven't experienced in your lifetime and even your experiences are influenced by a lot of external factors you have no control over. Long story short, it doesn't matter whether Christ actually existed or not and taking one side or the other is a lost cause. The story of Christ, specifically, teaches a way of life that religion has masqueraded for its own profit. Think for yourself.

Drugs may be a way out for you. I don't know. Let me know if you need any advice.

That's how you collect proofs?
For the most part, your use of oxygen seems unfortunate but I am certainly entertained! :)

The coinhive creator put out authedmine for those interested in using an opt-in JS miner in their websites. Seems like a fair use of a JS miner to me.

He has no idea about economics and he is selling crap to his followers. By his own terms, he is a functional scammer.

Plato missed the concept of governance altogether. Just read Politeia.
