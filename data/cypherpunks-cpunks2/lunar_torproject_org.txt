Welcome to the seventeenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the guarding Tor community.
Tor’s anonymity and guards parameters
George Kadianakis posted a list of items that need work in the Hidden
Service area [6]. Despite not being exhaustive, the list contains many
items that might help with upgrading the Hidden Service design, be it
around security, performance, guard issues or “petname” systems.
Help and comments are welcome!

Usability issues in existing OTR clients
The Tor Help Desk continues to be bombarded with help requests from
users behind university proxies who cannot use ORPort bridges or the
Pluggable Transports Browser to circumvent their network’s firewall.
Although the cases are not all the same, bridges on port 443 or port 80
do not always suffice to circumvent such proxies.
Ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) was released this week. One user
reported their Tor Browser Bundle behaving unusually after updating
their Ubuntu operating system. This issue was resolved by switching to
the Tor Browser Bundle 3. Another user asked when Tor APT repositories
would have packages for Saucy Salamander. Since then, packages for the
latest version of Ubuntu have been made available from the usual

Welcome to the eighteenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the Tor community.
A few highlights from this year’s Google Summer of Code
Using the Tor Browser Bundle is still proving to be tricky for many
Ubuntu users who upgraded from Ubuntu 13.04 to 13.10. The commonly
reported error is that users cannot enter text in any of the browser’s
text fields, including the URL and search bars. So far this problem
appears to be resolved by removing ibus with apt-get before running the
Tor Browser. Users who need ibus can try running `export
GTK_IM_MODULE=xim`, as documented in Trac ticket  [11].

An Austrian Tor exit node operator interpreted [20] their conviction in

Moritz Bartl from Torservers.net [21] commented [22]: “We strongly

find some legal expert in Austria and see what we can do to fight this.”
