To be honest... is it still interesting, if the first (...) moon landing was real or not?
I don't think so. Today we have Rosetta (Pluto), the Pathfinder-program (Mars) and many more projects running and in March 2016 there will start new ones... one from the NASA and one collaborative project from the EU & Russia Space-Program.
It doesn't matter, what was real and not in the 50s, 60s ~ 70s...?! We are here in 2015 and now Europe, Russia, China, India, Japan, Brazil and also America have their own explorer-programs and~or cooperate. They use the engines of the other countries (most of the time to safe money, because most of the times they underfunded), use also the technology of their neighbours, have contracts and investments, using the same start & landing-platforms, they track the satellites of and for other countries and so on... and we have other (~private) commercial projects~companies like SpaceX or Blue Origin.
And today you can hang on on their twitter-channels and watch live-video-transfers, can take a look at their raw-images in databases and can use own tracker-software-tools on your computer or telescope.
Today also american, european and russian people are visiting the International Space Station ~ ISS and work there together, share the stations on the earth and sure - every country has also their own, "secret program and projects". But what we can see today, is most of the time verifiable, because all big nations watching the "sky" and have also the technology for it to proof cases.
It is pointless to talk about the old 60s & 70s (and so on), because at this time most of the "successes" of american, russian, japanese or chinese trials where shown in the newsmedia as success and no country was telling the full truth about all failures and so on. It was a time, when we had the cold war and other strategic "problems" and everybody want to show is strongness. This means america, russia, china, europe, australia or japan. It doesn't matter - nobody was telling the full truth about all projects and events.
Today it will be still the same, but we have more independent stations, also scientists, who grew up in an other country like japan, but studied in the US and now working in europe at the ESA. Or americans who work for the india space program and also russia people working in america or brazil. The time has changed and knowledge is shared (or will be shared, independent if it's allowed or not).
So what is important, is what happens NOW, TODAY and TOMORROW on the moon, mars, pluto, sun, venus, jupiter and so one - because there are a lot of interesting stuff happen these days.
And this is my opinion as european. It's boring to read every few month a discussion about something, that happend decades before - without any result or target in the discussions, expect just to say "You lie, you wrong, I know it better, it wasn't the truth ~ or the truth". Use the energy for interesting stuff. Todays explorer-projects or recent stuff like syria and so on. But not for old, blurred images 50~ years ago.
That's just pointless.

Sorry, you've failed - because you discuss a science-topic about moon landing 50 years ago on a mailinglist like this. Why you don't talk with russian, european, japanese, american space-scientists directly (write a mail or call them) or at specific mailinglists (there are a lot of them, from NASA, ESA, FKA and so on) with these kind of topics and discuss there more specific - with more facts and more background?
For your personal information: I know, that america, syria, irak and so on is based on "lies" and it's a game of strategic, political targets. Nothing new, we all know that. I'm a europan and not a friend of americans. And for your suprise, I'm more on the east side (which means part of europe and russia opinion). But it doesn't matter for this case. You discuss a specific topic - and thousands of people have discussed about it since decades on IRC-Channels, BBS, Chats and so on. Youtube is exploding of "facts & secrets"-videos, there are thousand blogs with this specific case, there are hundreds of books about it.
Everything is shapping the present and the future. World War I, II, 30 year war, Vietnam, Iraq, Falkland, Syria today and so on. Snowden. Facebook. Twitter. RT. BBC.
But to "create" a new shape or a "real, correct view" here with this kind of discussion is pointless. To proof, that something was~is a fake, you need "facts" today. And not talks about about how bad a country or their people are and that's the reason, it must be a lie - because that's not the answer for a change in the world.
Give us or me ----- new ------ facts, which are really new. All of the discussion in the last years, point to the same videos, pages, books and so on and again and again showing the same stuff, which was discussed before... without new results. So it halted.
Example: We all knew, that there was mass-surveillance. Nothing new since years and their were endless discussions and fights about this topic. But then people like snowden or other ones show NEW, hard facts, new documents, new photos, new protocols, new accounts - stuff, that wasn't available before. THAT is something, that change(d) views and shapes of the future. Or stuff like that with the catalog and a story about it:  This is something, we can use to work with it. \o/
But I can't see any of these things here at this topic.
If you REALLY want to find out, what was happend a decade before, you won't use your time to discuss popular opinions from the web, videos and books in this list... instead you will contact people from this time, members of the NASA, scientists, companies, journalists, study this science and so on to find new findings, secrets or opinions, tracks and tales. After that you will create new documents, work on them, collect more facts, proof everything and together with other people or journalists - and THEN present them to us and the news-media worldwide. And THIS WILL change shapes of the past, present and future, opinions and the world itself.
But not with an discussion nr. 238290 about a window and a camera-shoot, based on the same old 1-2 shoots with the same results and the same opinions at the end.
My friend: "You missed the whole CORE point."
No, I've HIT the whole core point. Everybody can talk. Everybody can tell stories. Everybody can discuss. True stories or fakes. There is no art or secret behind that. But hard facts are the really power of these world today. Documents, records, videos or people, who were working their and give new, testable informations. Everything else is playing in the sandpit... and this is more and more "modern" in mailinglists these days, which is sad, because it won't help to correct things in this world. :/
I'm not educated enough to create my own sonde~satellite for the space or to land on the moon to proof everything. So I don't talk about facts, that I can't test or change their results. And I know that americans, europeans and also russia and other politics, intelligence services and so on talking bullshit most of the time. But this knowlege change only opinions, not facts. And that's the problem and whole point here.
