Reply-To: Tahoe-LAFS development ANNOUNCING Tahoe, the Least-Authority File System, v1.10
The Tahoe-LAFS team is pleased to announce the immediate
availability of version 1.10.0 of Tahoe-LAFS, an extremely
reliable distributed storage system. Get it here:
 in the following files (along with their SHA256 hashes):
  allmydata-tahoe-1.10.0.tar.bz2
  allmydata-tahoe-1.10.0.tar.gz
  allmydata-tahoe-1.10.0.zip
There are also -SUMO variants (which include all necessary
dependencies). All files are signed by the Tahoe-LAFS Release-Signing
Key, fingerprint E34E 62D0 6D0E 69CF CA41 79FF BDE0 D31D 6866 6A7A (look
for detached .asc files next to the tarballs in the directory above).
Instructions for download and installation are in:
 Tahoe-LAFS is the first distributed storage system to offer
"provider-independent security" b meaning that not even the
operators of your storage servers can read or alter your data
without your consent. Here is the one-page explanation of its
unique security and fault-tolerance properties:
 The previous stable release of Tahoe-LAFS was v1.9.2, released
on July 3, 2012.
v1.10.0 is a feature release which adds a new Introducer
protocol, improves the appearance of the web-based user
interface, improves grid security by making introducer FURLs
unguessable, and fixes many bugs. See the NEWS file [1] for
WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR?
With Tahoe-LAFS, you distribute your filesystem across
multiple servers, and even if some of the servers fail or are
taken over by an attacker, the entire filesystem continues to
work correctly, and continues to preserve your privacy and
security. You can easily share specific files and directories
with other people.
In addition to the core storage system itself, volunteers
have built other projects on top of Tahoe-LAFS and have
integrated Tahoe-LAFS with existing systems, including
Windows, JavaScript, iPhone, Android, Hadoop, Flume, Django,
Puppet, bzr, mercurial, perforce, duplicity, TiddlyWiki, and
more. See the Related Projects page on the wiki [3].
We believe that strong cryptography, Free and Open Source
Software, erasure coding, and principled engineering practices
make Tahoe-LAFS safer than RAID, removable drive, tape,
on-line backup or cloud storage.
This software is developed under test-driven development, and
there are no known bugs or security flaws which would
compromise confidentiality or data integrity under recommended
use. (For all important issues that we are currently aware of
please see the known_issues.rst file [2].)
This release should be compatible with the version 1 series of
Tahoe-LAFS. Clients from this release can write files and
directories in the format used by clients of all versions back
to v1.0 (which was released March 25, 2008). Clients from this
release can read files and directories produced by clients of
all versions since v1.0. Servers from this release can serve
clients of all versions back to v1.0 and clients from this
release can use servers of all versions back to v1.0.
Except for the new optional MDMF format, we have not made any
intentional compatibility changes. However we do not yet have
the test infrastructure to continuously verify that all new
versions are interoperable with previous versions. We intend
to build such an infrastructure in the future.
The new Introducer protocol added in v1.10 is backwards
compatible with older clients and introducer servers, however
some features will be unavailable when an older node is
involved. Please see docs/nodekeys.rst [14] for details.
This is the eighteenth release in the version 1 series. This
series of Tahoe-LAFS will be actively supported and maintained
for the foreseeable future, and future versions of Tahoe-LAFS
will retain the ability to read and write files compatible
with this series.

HACKING AND COMMUNITY
Please join us on the mailing list [7]. Patches are gratefully
accepted -- the RoadMap page [8] shows the next improvements
that we plan to make and CREDITS [9] lists the names of people
who've contributed to the project. The Dev page [10] contains
resources for hackers.
Atlas Networks has contributed several hosted servers for
performance testing. Thank you to Atlas Networks [11] for
their generous and public-spirited support.
And a special thanks to Least Authority Enterprises [12],
which employs several Tahoe-LAFS developers, for their
continued support.
HACK TAHOE-LAFS!
If you can find a security flaw in Tahoe-LAFS which is serious
enough that we feel compelled to warn our users and issue a fix,
then we will award you with a customized t-shirts with your
exploit printed on it and add you to the "Hack Tahoe-LAFS Hall
Of Fame" [13].
This is the twelfth release of Tahoe-LAFS to be created solely
as a labor of love by volunteers. Thank you very much to the
team of "hackers in the public interest" who make Tahoe-LAFS
