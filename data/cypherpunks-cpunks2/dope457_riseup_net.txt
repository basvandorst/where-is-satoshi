Tor Weekly News                                       November 6th, 2013
Welcome to the nineteenth issue of Tor Weekly News, the weekly
newsletter that covers what is happening in the up-to-date Tor
Tails 0.21 is out
One person asked why the lock icon on the Tor Project's website was not
outlined  in green. Sites that use HTTPS can purchase different types of
SSL certificates.  Some certificate issuers offer certificates that
supply ownership information, such  as the physical address of the
website operator, for a higher price. Sites that use  these certificates
get the lock icon by their URL outlined in green. The Tor Project  adds
protection to the validity of our SSL certificate a different way, by
supplying  our SSL certificate fingerprint on our FAQ page [23]. You can
double check that  fingerprint on any of the Tor Project's mirror pages
as well [24].
One person wanted to known why a website they were visiting over Firefox
was telling them that they were not using Tor, even though Vidalia told
them that Tor was running.  By default, the Tor Browser Bundle does not
anonymize all the traffic on your computer.  Only the traffic you send
through the Tor Browser Bundle will be anonymized. If you  have Firefox
and the Tor Browser open at the same time, the traffic you send through
Firefox will not be anonymous. Using Firefox and Tor Browser Bundle at
the same time is  not a great idea because the two interfaces are almost
identical, and it is easy to get  the two browsers mixed up, even if you
know what you are doing.
