"licensing" and "insurance".
What is wrong with you eco-commie fucks.
Automobiles can be anything-powered.

The greatest "greenhouse gas" is water vapor.
Did you know ~60% of the Antarctic melts and re freezes every year?
Ever heard of the Younger Dryas?
Or ice/ocean/soil core samples?
All this disproves your shekel grabbing scheme's premise that humans,
and their pesky cars, are "killing the planet" with CO2 (“muh
In Rayzer's future, if you want exercise more and live a more
healthful life, "that'll be more cryptoshekels, sir".
Show how or GTFO.

Yet you provide no reason.
Your appeal to authority is logical fallacy.
