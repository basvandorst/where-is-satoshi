@_subject: Wikileaked Stratfor admin talks crypto. Nonsense? 
'Any encryption based on an algorithm can be decrypted with the
resources available to a government.'
These are words of Michael Mooney, the hapless system administrator of
Stratfor, a private intelligence agency that got hacked, doxed, and
wikileaked in 2011-2012:
Is Mr Mooney correct?
On the one hand he's proven his incompetence by storing clients' credit
card numbers in the clear. On the other hand, Stratfor sell themselves
as spooks well-versed in security questions and hence could know better.
What do cypherpunks think of Mr Mooney's statement? Does it really take
a government only one month to crack a 2048-bit key?
