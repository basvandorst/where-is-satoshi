Very excited about this, particularly the 80 bytes embeddable message.  I
do believe satoshi mentioned he wanted to add short messages, at some point.
Great work Gavin & all!

I believe the retroshare project (noted on this list many times) is in the
process of implementing a P2P ripple (a la Ryan Fugger's original protocol)
system, or have done so already.  Dr Bob told me you can plug in other
protocols such as GNUNet quite easily.  I'm unsure how this would gel with
Tor tho.
I'm also looking at translating all of the crypto currency work to a web
based system.  Would be very happy to hear if you make any progress on
this.  Or perhaps we can discuss off list if some stuff is off topic.
My current line of thinking is hacking the economy so that fbx users get
their own coins that they can spend with each other, and to give, say, 10%
of all new coins to the FSF to help lower hardware costs of plug computers
