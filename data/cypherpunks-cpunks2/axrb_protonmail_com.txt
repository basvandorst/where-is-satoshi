So for the past six months or so google has decided to infesting their
gmail webmail with tracking redirectors on all things that look like links.
To be expected, and fuck em straight to hell.
But who else find it hilarious they chose 'usg' as the tracking
parameter name ;)
I'm surprised they didn't start doing this long ago. Lots of juicy data to mine there.
I'm guessing you can get around this by using IMAP or POP3 to read your email. I wonder what their monetization plan is for customers who read their mail with an email client?

So why use GMail?
I often wonder the same thing myself. I think the answer is that nobody who really cares about their privacy does. But then again, it's not like the other solutions available to the lay person are necessarily much better, particularly the free ones. 'cept maybe ProtonMail. (Let's hope.)
