The Heresy of Technological Choice
by John Michael Greer
The Archdruid Report (November 18 2015)
Among the interesting benefits of writing a blog like this, focusing as
it does on the end of industrial civilization, are the opportunities it
routinely affords for a glimpse at the stranger side of the collective
thinking of our time. The last few weeks have been an unusually good
source of that experience, as a result of one detail of the Retrotopia
narrative I've been developing in the posts here.
The detail in question is the system by which residents of my fictional
Lakeland Republic choose how much infrastructure they want to have and,
not incidentally, to pay for via their local tax revenues. It's done on
a county-by-county basis by majority vote. The more infrastructure you
want, the higher your taxes are; the more infrastructure you can do
without, the less of your income goes to the county to pay for it. There
are five levels, called tiers, and each one has a notional date
connected to it: thus tier five has the notional date of 1950, and
corresponds to the infrastructure you'd expect to find in a county in
the Midwestern states of the US in that year: countywide electrical,
telephone, water, and sewer service; roads and related infrastructure
throughout the county capable of handling heavy automobile use; and mass
transit - specifically, streetcars - in the towns.
The other tiers have less infrastructure, and correspondingly lower
taxes. Tier four has a notional date of 1920, tier three of 1890, tier
two of 1860, and tier one of 1830. In each case, the infrastructure
you'd find in such a county is roughly what you'd find in a midwestern
American county in that year. With tier one, your county infrastructure
consists of dirt roads and that's about it. All the other functions of
county government exist in tier one, tier five, and everything in
between; there are courts, police, social welfare provisions for those
who are unable to take care of themselves, and so forth - all the things
you would expect to find in any midwestern county in the US at any point
between 1830 and 1950. That's the tier system: one small detail of the
imaginary future I've been sketching here.
Before we go on, I'd like my readers to stop and notice that the only
things that are subject to the tier system are the elements of local
infrastructure that are paid for by local tax revenues. If you live in a
county that voted to adopt a certain tier level, that tells you what
kind of infrastructure will be funded by local tax revenues, and
therefore what the tax bills are going to be like. That's all it tells
you. In particular, the tier system doesn't apply to privately owned
infrastructure - for example, railroads in the Lakeland Republic are
privately owned, and so every county, whatever its tier, has train
stations in any town where paying passengers and freight may be found in
sufficient quantity to make it worth a railroad's while to stop there.
The tier system also, and crucially, doesn't determine what kind of
technology the residents can use. If you live in a tier one county, you
can use all the electrical appliances you can afford to buy, as long as
you generate the electricity yourself. Some technologies that are
completely dependent on public infrastructure aren't going to work in a
low tier county - for example, without paved roads, gas stations, huge
government subsidies for petroleum production, military bases all over
the Middle East, and a great deal more, cars aren't much more than
oversized paperweights - but that's built into the technology in
question, not any fault of the tier system. Furthermore, the tier system
doesn't determine social customs and mores. If you live in a tier four
county, for example, no law requires you to dress in a zoot suit or a
flapper dress, drink bootleg liquor, and say things like "Hubba hubba"
and "Twenty-three skidoo!" This may seem obvious, but trust me, it's
apparently far from obvious to a certain portion of my readers.
I can say this because, ever since the tier system first got mentioned
in the narrative, I've fielded a steady stream of comments from people
who wanted to object to the tier system because it forcibly deprives
people of access to technology. I had one reader insist that the tier
system would keep farmers in tier one counties from using plastic
sheeting for hoop houses, for example, and another who compared the
system to the arrangements in former Eastern Bloc nations, where the
Communist Party imposed rigid restrictions on what technologies people
could have. The mere facts that plastic sheeting for hoop houses isn't
infrastructure paid for by tax revenues, and that the tier system
doesn't impose rigid restrictions on anybody - on the contrary, it
allows the voters in each county to choose for themselves how much
infrastructure they're going to pay for - somehow never found their way
into the resulting diatribes.
What made all this even more fascinating to me is that no matter how
often I addressed the points in question, and pointed out that the tier
system just allows local voters to choose what infrastructure gets paid
for their by tax money, a certain fraction of readers just kept
rabbiting on endlessly along the same lines. It wasn't that they were
disagreeing with what I was saying. It's that they were acting as though
I had never said anything to address the subject at all, even when I
addressed it to their faces, and nothing I or anyone else could say was
able to break through their conviction that in imagining the tier
system, I must be talking about some way to deprive people of technology
by main force.
It was after the third or fourth round of comments along these lines, I
think it was, that a sudden sense of deja vu reminded me that I'd seen
this same sort of curiously detached paralogic before.
Longtime readers of this blog will remember how, some years ago, I
pointed out in passing that the survival of the internet in the

constraints. They simply didn't want to think about that, much less talk
about it, and so they babbled endlessly about other things in a frantic
attempt to drown out a subject they couldn't bear to hear discussed openly.
I'm pretty sure that this is what's going on in the present case, too,
and an interesting set of news stories from earlier this year points up
the unspoken logic behind it.
Port Townsend is a pleasant little town in Washington State, perched on
a bluff above the western shores of Puget Sound. Due to the vagaries of
the regional economy, it basically got bypassed by the twentieth
century, and much of the housing stock dates from the Victorian era. It
so happens that one couple who live there find Victorian technology,
clothing, and personal habits more to their taste than the current
fashions in these things, and they live, as thoroughly as they can, a
Victorian lifestyle. The wife of the couple, Sarah Chrisman, recently
wrote a book about her experiences, and got her canonical fifteen
minutes of fame on the internet and the media as a result.
You might think, dear reader, that the people of Port Townsend would
treat this as merely a harmless eccentricity, or even find it pleasantly
amusing to have a couple in Victorian cycling clothes riding their
penny-farthing bicycles on the city streets. To some extent, you'd be
right, but it's the exceptions that I want to discuss here. Ever since
they adopted their Victorian lifestyle, the Chrismans have been on the
receiving end of constant harassment by people who find their presence
in the community intolerable. The shouted insults, the in-your-face
confrontations, the death threats - they've seen it all. What's more,
the appearance of Sarah Chrisman's book and various online articles
related to it fielded, in response, an impressive flurry of spluttering
online denunciations, which insisted among other things that the fact
that she prefers to wear long skirts and corsets somehow makes her
personally responsible for all the sins that have ever been imputed to
the Victorian era.
Why? Why the fury, the brutality, and the frankly irrational
denunciations directed at a couple whose lifestyle choices have got to
count well up there among the world's most harmless hobbies?
The reason's actually very simple. Sarah Chrisman and her husband have
transgressed one of the modern world's most rigidly enforced taboos.
They've shown in the most irrefutable way, by personal example, that the
technologies each of us use in our own lives are a matter of individual
You're not supposed to say that in today's world. You're not even
supposed to think it. You're allowed, at most, to talk nostalgically
about how much more pleasant it must have been not to be constantly
harassed and annoyed by the current round of officially prescribed
technologies, and squashed into the Procrustean bed of the narrow range
of acceptable lifestyles that go with them. Even that's risky in many
circles these days, and risks fielding a diatribe from somebody who just
has to tell you, at great length and with obvious irritation, all about
the horrible things you'd supposedly suffer if you didn't have the
current round of officially prescribed technologies constantly harassing
and annoying you.
The nostalgia in question doesn't have to be oriented toward the past. I
long ago lost track of the number of people I've heard talk
nostalgically about what I tend to call the Ecotopian future, the
default vision of a green tomorrow that infests most minds on the
leftward end of things. Unless you've been hiding under a rock for the
last forty years, you already know every detail of the Ecotopian future.
It's the place where wind turbines and solar panels power everything,
everyone commutes by bicycle from their earth-sheltered suburban homes
to their LEED-certified urban workplaces, everything is recycled, and
social problems have all been solved because everybody, without
exception, has come to embrace the ideas and attitudes currently found
among upper-middle-class San Francisco liberals.
It's far from rare, at sustainability-oriented events, to hear
well-to-do attendees waxing rhapsodically about how great life will be
when the Ecotopian future arrives. If you encounter someone engaging in
that sort of nostalgic exercise, and are minded to be cruel, ask the
person who's doing it whether he (it's usually a man) bicycles to work,
and if not, why not. Odds are you'll get to hear any number of frantic
excuses to explain why the lifestyle that everyone's going to love in
the Ecotopian future is one that he can't possibly embrace today. If you
want a look behind the excuses and evasions, ask him how he got to the
sustainability-oriented event you're attending. Odds are that he drove
his SUV, in which there were no other passengers, and if you press him
about that you can expect to see the dark heart of privilege and rage
that underlies his enthusiastic praise of an imaginary lifestyle that he
would never, not even for a moment, dream of adopting himself.
I wish I were joking about the rage. It so happens that I don't have a
car, a television, or a cell phone, and I have zero interest in ever
having any of these things. My defection from the officially prescribed
technologies and the lifestyles that go with them isn't as immediately
obvious as Sarah Chrisman's, so I don't take as much day to day
harassment as she does. Still, it happens from time to time that
somebody wants to know if I've seen this or that television program, and
in the conversations that unfold from such questions it sometimes comes
out that I don't have a television at all.
Where I now live, in an old red brick mill town in the north central
Appalachians, that revelation rarely gets a hostile response, and it's
fairly common for someone else to say, "Good for you", or something like
that. A lot of people here are very poor, and thus have a certain
detachment from technologies and lifestyles they know perfectly well
they will never be able to afford. Back when I lived in prosperous Left
Coast towns, on the other hand, mentioning that I didn't own a
television routinely meant that I'd get to hear a long and patronizing
disquisition about how I really ought to run out and buy a TV so I could
watch this or that or the other really really wonderful program, in the
absence of which my life must be intolerably barren and incomplete.
Any lack of enthusiasm for that sort of disquisition very reliably
brought out a variety of furiously angry responses that had precisely
nothing to do with the issue at hand, which is that I simply don't enjoy
the activity of watching television. Oh, and it's not the programming I
find unenjoyable - it's the technology itself; I get bored very quickly
with the process of watching little colored images jerking about on a
glass screen, no matter what the images happen to be. That's another
taboo, by the way. It's acceptable in today's America to grumble about
what's on television, but the technology itself is sacrosanct; you're
not allowed to criticize it, much less to talk about the biases,
agendas, and simple annoyances hardwired into television as a
technological system. If you try to bring any of that up, people will
insist that you're criticizing the programming; if you correct them,
they'll ignore the correction and keep on talking as though the programs
on TV are the only thing under discussion.
A similar issue drives the bizarre paralogic surrounding the
nonresponses to the tier system discussed above. The core premises
behind the tier system in my narrative are, first, that people can
choose the technological infrastructure they have, and have to pay for -
and second, that some of them, when they consider the costs and benefits
involved, might reasonably decide that an infrastructure of dirt roads
and a landscape of self-sufficient farms and small towns is the best
option. To a great many people today, that's heresy of the most
unthinkable sort. The easiest way to deal with the heresy in question,
for those who aren't interested in thinking about it, is to pretend that
nothing so shocking has been suggested at all, and force the discussion
into some less threatening form as quickly as possible. Redefining it in
ways that erase the unbearable idea that technologies can be chosen
freely, and just as freely rejected, is quite probably the easiest way
to do that.
I'd encourage those of my readers who aren't blinded by the terror of
intellectual heresy to think, and think hard, about the taboo against
technological choice - the insistence that you cannot, may not, and must
not make your own choices when it comes to whatever the latest
technological fad happens to be, but must do as you're told and accept
whatever technology the consumer society hands you, no matter how
dysfunctional, harmful, or boring it turns out to be. That taboo is very
deeply ingrained, far more potent than the handful of relatively weak
taboos our society still applies to such things as sexuality, and most
of the people you know obey it so unthinkingly that they never even
notice how it shapes their behavior. You may not notice how it shapes
your behavior, for that matter; the best way to find out is to pick a
technology that annoys, harms, or bores you, but that you use anyway,
and get rid of it.
Those who take that unthinkable step, and embrace the heresy of
technological choice, are part of the wave of the future. In a world of
declining resource availability, unraveling economic systems, and
destabilizing environments, Sarah Chrisman and the many other people who
make similar choices - there are quite a few of them these days, and
more of them with each year that passes - are making a wise choice. By
taking up technologies and lifeways from less extravagant eras, they're
decreasing their environmental footprints and their vulnerability to
faltering global technostructures, and they're also contributing to one
of the crucial tasks of our age: the rediscovery of ways of being human
that don't depend on hopelessly unsustainable levels of resource and
energy consumption.
The heresy of technological choice is a door. Beyond it lies an
unexplored landscape of possibilities for the future - possibilities
that very few people have even begun to imagine yet. My Retrotopia
narrative is meant to glance over a very small part of that landscape.
If some of the terrain it's examined so far has been threatening enough
to send some of its readers fleeing into a familiar sort of paralogic,
then I'm confident that it's doing the job I hoped it would do.

order to replace those that will burn out the next day.
They knew all this, and they knew, or at least suspected, just how
little of it will be viable in a future of harsh energy and resource
constraints. They simply didn't want to think about that, much less talk
about it, and so they babbled endlessly about other things in a frantic
attempt to drown out a subject they couldn't bear to hear discussed openly.
I'm pretty sure that this is what's going on in the present case, too,
and an interesting set of news stories from earlier this year points up
the unspoken logic behind it.
Port Townsend is a pleasant little town in Washington State, perched on
a bluff above the western shores of Puget Sound. Due to the vagaries of
the regional economy, it basically got bypassed by the twentieth
century, and much of the housing stock dates from the Victorian era. It
so happens that one couple who live there find Victorian technology,
clothing, and personal habits more to their taste than the current
fashions in these things, and they live, as thoroughly as they can, a
Victorian lifestyle. The wife of the couple, Sarah Chrisman, recently
wrote a book about her experiences, and got her canonical fifteen
minutes of fame on the internet and the media as a result.
You might think, dear reader, that the people of Port Townsend would
treat this as merely a harmless eccentricity, or even find it pleasantly
amusing to have a couple in Victorian cycling clothes riding their
penny-farthing bicycles on the city streets. To some extent, you'd be
right, but it's the exceptions that I want to discuss here. Ever since
they adopted their Victorian lifestyle, the Chrismans have been on the
receiving end of constant harassment by people who find their presence
in the community intolerable. The shouted insults, the in-your-face
confrontations, the death threats - they've seen it all. What's more,
the appearance of Sarah Chrisman's book and various online articles
related to it fielded, in response, an impressive flurry of spluttering
online denunciations, which insisted among other things that the fact
that she prefers to wear long skirts and corsets somehow makes her
personally responsible for all the sins that have ever been imputed to
the Victorian era.
Why? Why the fury, the brutality, and the frankly irrational
denunciations directed at a couple whose lifestyle choices have got to
count well up there among the world's most harmless hobbies?
The reason's actually very simple. Sarah Chrisman and her husband have
transgressed one of the modern world's most rigidly enforced taboos.
They've shown in the most irrefutable way, by personal example, that the
technologies each of us use in our own lives are a matter of individual
You're not supposed to say that in today's world. You're not even
supposed to think it. You're allowed, at most, to talk nostalgically
about how much more pleasant it must have been not to be constantly
harassed and annoyed by the current round of officially prescribed
technologies, and squashed into the Procrustean bed of the narrow range
of acceptable lifestyles that go with them. Even that's risky in many
circles these days, and risks fielding a diatribe from somebody who just
has to tell you, at great length and with obvious irritation, all about
the horrible things you'd supposedly suffer if you didn't have the
current round of officially prescribed technologies constantly harassing
and annoying you.
The nostalgia in question doesn't have to be oriented toward the past. I
long ago lost track of the number of people I've heard talk
nostalgically about what I tend to call the Ecotopian future, the
default vision of a green tomorrow that infests most minds on the
leftward end of things. Unless you've been hiding under a rock for the
last forty years, you already know every detail of the Ecotopian future.
It's the place where wind turbines and solar panels power everything,
everyone commutes by bicycle from their earth-sheltered suburban homes
to their LEED-certified urban workplaces, everything is recycled, and
social problems have all been solved because everybody, without
exception, has come to embrace the ideas and attitudes currently found
among upper-middle-class San Francisco liberals.
It's far from rare, at sustainability-oriented events, to hear
well-to-do attendees waxing rhapsodically about how great life will be
when the Ecotopian future arrives. If you encounter someone engaging in
that sort of nostalgic exercise, and are minded to be cruel, ask the
person who's doing it whether he (it's usually a man) bicycles to work,
and if not, why not. Odds are you'll get to hear any number of frantic
excuses to explain why the lifestyle that everyone's going to love in
the Ecotopian future is one that he can't possibly embrace today. If you
want a look behind the excuses and evasions, ask him how he got to the
sustainability-oriented event you're attending. Odds are that he drove
his SUV, in which there were no other passengers, and if you press him
about that you can expect to see the dark heart of privilege and rage
that underlies his enthusiastic praise of an imaginary lifestyle that he
would never, not even for a moment, dream of adopting himself.
I wish I were joking about the rage. It so happens that I don't have a
car, a television, or a cell phone, and I have zero interest in ever
having any of these things. My defection from the officially prescribed
technologies and the lifestyles that go with them isn't as immediately
obvious as Sarah Chrisman's, so I don't take as much day to day
harassment as she does. Still, it happens from time to time that
somebody wants to know if I've seen this or that television program, and
in the conversations that unfold from such questions it sometimes comes
out that I don't have a television at all.
Where I now live, in an old red brick mill town in the north central
Appalachians, that revelation rarely gets a hostile response, and it's
fairly common for someone else to say, "Good for you", or something like
that. A lot of people here are very poor, and thus have a certain
detachment from technologies and lifestyles they know perfectly well
they will never be able to afford. Back when I lived in prosperous Left
Coast towns, on the other hand, mentioning that I didn't own a
television routinely meant that I'd get to hear a long and patronizing
disquisition about how I really ought to run out and buy a TV so I could
watch this or that or the other really really wonderful program, in the
absence of which my life must be intolerably barren and incomplete.
Any lack of enthusiasm for that sort of disquisition very reliably
brought out a variety of furiously angry responses that had precisely
nothing to do with the issue at hand, which is that I simply don't enjoy
the activity of watching television. Oh, and it's not the programming I
find unenjoyable - it's the technology itself; I get bored very quickly
with the process of watching little colored images jerking about on a
glass screen, no matter what the images happen to be. That's another
taboo, by the way. It's acceptable in today's America to grumble about
what's on television, but the technology itself is sacrosanct; you're
not allowed to criticize it, much less to talk about the biases,
agendas, and simple annoyances hardwired into television as a
technological system. If you try to bring any of that up, people will
insist that you're criticizing the programming; if you correct them,
they'll ignore the correction and keep on talking as though the programs
on TV are the only thing under discussion.
A similar issue drives the bizarre paralogic surrounding the
nonresponses to the tier system discussed above. The core premises
behind the tier system in my narrative are, first, that people can
choose the technological infrastructure they have, and have to pay for -
and second, that some of them, when they consider the costs and benefits
involved, might reasonably decide that an infrastructure of dirt roads
and a landscape of self-sufficient farms and small towns is the best
option. To a great many people today, that's heresy of the most
unthinkable sort. The easiest way to deal with the heresy in question,
for those who aren't interested in thinking about it, is to pretend that
nothing so shocking has been suggested at all, and force the discussion
into some less threatening form as quickly as possible. Redefining it in
ways that erase the unbearable idea that technologies can be chosen
freely, and just as freely rejected, is quite probably the easiest way
to do that.
I'd encourage those of my readers who aren't blinded by the terror of
intellectual heresy to think, and think hard, about the taboo against
technological choice - the insistence that you cannot, may not, and must
not make your own choices when it comes to whatever the latest
technological fad happens to be, but must do as you're told and accept
whatever technology the consumer society hands you, no matter how
dysfunctional, harmful, or boring it turns out to be. That taboo is very
deeply ingrained, far more potent than the handful of relatively weak
taboos our society still applies to such things as sexuality, and most
of the people you know obey it so unthinkingly that they never even
notice how it shapes their behavior. You may not notice how it shapes
your behavior, for that matter; the best way to find out is to pick a
technology that annoys, harms, or bores you, but that you use anyway,
and get rid of it.
Those who take that unthinkable step, and embrace the heresy of
technological choice, are part of the wave of the future. In a world of
declining resource availability, unraveling economic systems, and
destabilizing environments, Sarah Chrisman and the many other people who
make similar choices - there are quite a few of them these days, and
more of them with each year that passes - are making a wise choice. By
taking up technologies and lifeways from less extravagant eras, they're
decreasing their environmental footprints and their vulnerability to
faltering global technostructures, and they're also contributing to one
of the crucial tasks of our age: the rediscovery of ways of being human
that don't depend on hopelessly unsustainable levels of resource and
energy consumption.
The heresy of technological choice is a door. Beyond it lies an
unexplored landscape of possibilities for the future - possibilities
that very few people have even begun to imagine yet. My Retrotopia
narrative is meant to glance over a very small part of that landscape.
If some of the terrain it's examined so far has been threatening enough
to send some of its readers fleeing into a familiar sort of paralogic,
then I'm confident that it's doing the job I hoped it would do.
