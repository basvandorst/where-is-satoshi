Peep the core samples, son.
Randall Carlson quote re: 'Oxygen Isotopes in Greenland':
"As [the Earth] began to cool off, the temerature oscillations began to
increase in magnitude."
"The climate change that took us from glacial to interglacial happened in
less than five years."
New ice core records show Greenland in sync with the rest of the globe:
A Brief Explanation of Oxygen Isotopes in Paleoclimate studies:
Greenland warming during the last interglacial: the relative importance of
insolation and oceanic changes:
Spatial and temporal oxygen isotope variability in northern Greenland 
implications for a new climate record over the past millennium:
Stable Isotopes and Climate History from Polar Ice Cores (full of pics):
