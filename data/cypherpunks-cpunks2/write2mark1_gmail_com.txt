Seeking original paper by satoshi nakamoto  posted by satoshi at
vistomail.com  The current version
of the whitepaper uploaded on Sourceforge is from 2009-03-24. This is the
second version of the whitepaper. The first version was published on
2008-10-31. It was uploaded to  which is where
the current version also resides. Did anyone here happen to download and

That’s a great test 🙏👍
The personal identity of Satoshi over time as you say is very nuanced much like dpr of Silk road as multiple characters over time took the mantle of dpr   But even with all of the dprs Ross Ulbricht was definitely doxed by the feds
Just worried there’s the very first og Satoshi who might still be around

There’s no crypto key or proof of ownership of the genesis blocks 😥 in this site or excerpt   But the excerpt does read very well a Little too wordy for Satoshi who I remember as terse and matter of fact

Yes, he did sign the genesis blocks as they ran on his laptop ?

Yes, lots of battery R&D underway.
Sorry I posted "up", but my stupid Yahoo email editor would not add a line
(or lines) below your comments, at least not without "exploding" your cite
to include the picture, etc.  Couldn't figure out how to fix that, except
by commenting "up".
In the last week or so, I saw a news item about a new form of carbon, which
seems to allow a doubling of energy density in Lithium ion batteries, yet
being much safer.
  Anybody who uses cell phones, or electric cars, should rejoice.
Myself, I've been following for a few years "magnesium ion batteries",
google 'magnesium ion battery',
 first result:

As automation displaces the great majority of workers, labor (not
industrial) productivity will zoom past zero.
As for energy, battery, and other temporary energy storage, will surely
improve though increases in density could become a major saftey factor as
they equal or exceed liquid fuel (perhaps even high explosives). Preventing
such batteries and ultra-ultra-capacitors from sudden discharge is still a
relatively unsolved issue.
This article sure sounds foolish.  As I see it, the main driver in the
increase in "growth"  (other than population) is productivity.
Productivity tends to be driven by gradual adoptions of automation, which
has been a major factor for 50+ years, and actually far larger.  Automation
isn't going away, and will only increase in effectiveness for decades
Energy is a factor, but society is well on its way to the widespread
adoption of solar and wind energy.  Solar is useful in most locations, and
wind will eventually be useable just about everywhere, 24 hours per day,
with the use of low-resistance materials to conduct that energy, for
example metallic carbon nanotubes.  (MCNTs).

" If we extrapolate this trend forward, labour productivity growth would
reach zero by 2028."
