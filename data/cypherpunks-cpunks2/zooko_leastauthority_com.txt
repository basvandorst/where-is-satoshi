@_subject: [tahoe-dev] Weekly Dev Chat notes from 2013-03-07 
Sheesh, it takes a lot longer to write these notes up for the list
than it does to actually attend the dev chat.
in attendance: Oleksandr, Zooko (scribe), David-Sarah, Randall
"ClashTheBunny" Mason, Brian (latebone lash), Tony (latebone lash)
not in attendance: Andrew (ABSENTbtwo lashes)
sort-of-in-attendance (on the IRC channel): a lot of folks
Agenda: Tahoe-LAFS v1.10 (Nuts and Bolts)
This was awesome. We got lots of tickets closed, or at least pushed forward a
step or two. This was the most productive hour of ticket-closing work
ever. We're going to do it again next week! If you like doing code-review and
writing unit tests, you should join us.
You can see also use the Trac Timeline:
ClashTheBunny has some patches for IPv6 for Tahoe-LAFS and Foolscap (
and has some tests of them but needs more thorough tests. However, we didn't
look at that this time, because we focused on tickets for Tahoe-LAFS v1.10.
Nejucomo said on IRC that he wasn't going to get around to manually verifying
that the bug we fixed in ticket  was the same as the bug he reported. I
decided to just close the ticket for the following reasons: there *is* a bug
that we understand, there is a fix which is clear, there is a unit test that
exercises the bug that is red without the fix and green with the fix, and The
Dod manually verified that it fixed the problem in practice for him. The only
reason we've left the ticket open waiting for Nejucomo to test is in case
Nathan actually has a *different* bug than this one. But we don't need to
keep the ticket open for that eventuality.
ClashTheBunny did design review on  He approved the design and made
good comments that showed that he actually had thought about it. Subsequently
Zooko added another design question and assigned it to Brian for design
We looked at  It is a blocker because it makes the SFTP frontend
incompatible with the current stable release of Twisted. However it is closed
as a duplicate of  because the improvement in  would remove the
incompatibility. We briefly considered kludging it by requiring people to
install an older Twisted, but instead decided to fix it the good
way. David-Sarah had already implemented the fix to  but there was
something wrong with the unit test.
NEWFLASH! This just in! As we were going to press, David-Sarah posted on
 a comment that they are currently working on it.
We discussed  David-Sarah had an idea for how to make the
implementation simple, by incrementing the server-wide counter once for each
service. Brian will work on it. It and  are the two blockers that
require new code to be written before we release Tahoe-LAFS v1.10.
We closed  as fixed. Yay!
 is finished, reviewed, and ought to go into Tahoe-LAFS v1.10, but I
can't figure out how to merge it into master using git. I don't understand
how to use git very well, since I've only been using it on a daily basis for
a little more than two years now...
 was already applied, but there was something wrong with it according to
Brian. Do we need to fix that as a blocker for 1.10 release?
We agreed to drop support for Python 2.5 and therefore for CentOS 5.
In the last few minutes of the hangout, we agreed that next week's hangout
will be another Nuts And Bolts like this one, hopefully bringing Tahoe-LAFS
v1.10 close to completion. Brian will work on  Someone (maybe Zooko??)
will work on Then we briefly mentioned the possibility of switching from a "semantic
versioning" style version number, to a YEAR.RELEASE_COUNT version number like
Twisted does. So instead of Tahoe-LAFS v1.10, this might be Tahoe-LAFS
v13.0. Then if there is another release in 2013, that would be Tahoe-LAFS
v13.1. We also considered leaving it alone for the "v1.10" release, and
switching styles for the next release.
Currently we use the "1." in "Tahoe-LAFS v1.10" to mean that it has
backward-compatibility with all of the stable Tahoe-LAFS releases since v1.0
(released March 25, 2008:
). I'm not sure that's accurate. While we have never deliberately violated
that goal, and we are not aware of any change that we've made which would
break that compatibility, on the other hand we don't have automated or manual
testing of backwards compatibility. Anyway, I suspect that there aren't any
users of Tahoe-LAFS versions older than 1.9.2:
tickets mentioned in this letter:
 use ipv6
 CLI: overzealous
quoting of error messages
 SFTP: handle
download failures correctly; remove use of IFinishableConsumer
 Nondeterministic
NoSharesError for direct CHK download in 1.8.3 and 1.9.1
 consider changes
to webapi "Move" API before release
 write test for
anti-Ubuntu-crash-reporter exception-catching code
 update
Announcement "timestamp": sequence number?
parse_abbreviated_size doesn't accept T for terabytes (and other
quibbles with the regex it uses)
 Failed to load
application: cannot import name IFinishableConsumer

@_subject: [tahoe-dev] Tahoe-LAFS Users Group Meeting, San Francisco, 
You are invited to the Tahoe-LAFS Users Group Meeting!
Tahoe-LAFS is a secure, fault-tolerant, scalable storage system. It is
a Free/Open Source Software project. It is also an idea: we want to
see a World Wide Web that can't be censored or surveilled; a Web with
no master.
when and where:
Tuesday, March 19, 2013, 6 PM to 9 PM
Rackspace, 620 Folsom, Suite 100, San Francisco, CA
There will be pizza, from Goat Hill Pizza. Thanks to Rackspace for the
location and food!
1. "Announcing Tahoe-LAFS v1.10"
2. "Tahoe-LAFS For Engineers Who Don't Care About Security"
A 20-minute demo of installing the Tahoe-LAFS software, deploying a
grid of storage servers, using them to upload, download and browse
files. Then the punch line: did you notice what we *didn't* do during
this demo? Screw around with certificates, keys, encryption, or
decryption! You don't have to spend your time messing with that stuff
in order to use Tahoe-LAFS.
3. "What Should We Put Into Tahoe-LAFS v1.11?"
Who is using Tahoe-LAFS, what are you using it for, and what would it
make it more useful for you?

@_subject: [zfs] [Review] 4185 New hash algorithm support 
A good way to do that is use an algorithm that has attracted interest
from a large number of independent cryptographers. If many
cryptographers have invested extensive effort trying to find
weaknesses in a algorithm, and haven't reported any, then we can feel
more confident that it is less likely to harbor undiscovered
Among the algorithms we've been talking about in this thread, SHA-256,
HMAC-MD5, Skein, Keccak, and BLAKE are all in this category of being
Cryptographers publish it if they find a weakness in a reduced-round
variant of an important algorithm. You can see a summary of the best
results against weakened variants of BLAKE in ¹ (Table 1).
¹ The rows labeled "perm." and "cf." are attacks on just one component
of the hash, not the whole algorithm. The "# Rounds" column shows how
many rounds of a reduced-round variant would be vulnerable to that
Don't forget to look at the "Complexity" column, too! That shows
(roughly) how many calculations would be necessary to implement the
attack. Yes, almost all of them are computations that are completely
impossible for anyone to actually execute in the forseeable future.
But still, they are the best attack that anyone has (publicly) come up
with against those weakened variants of BLAKE so they serve as a
heuristic indicator of how strong it is.
Among the well-studied algorithms listed above, BLAKE is one of the
best-studied. It was one of the five finalists in the SHA-3 contest,
and in the final report of the contest ², NIST wrote “The
cryptanalysis performed on BLAKE […] appears to have a great deal of
depth”. Here is a list of research reports that analyzed BLAKE: ³.
² ³ Now, BLAKE2 is not necessarily as secure as BLAKE. We could have
accidentally introduced weaknesses into BLAKE2 when making tweaks to
optimize it. The paper ¹ looked for such weaknesses and reported that
they found nothing to make them distrust BLAKE2.
We use a stream cipher named ChaCha ⁴,⁵ as the core of BLAKE and
BLAKE2, and nobody has found any weakness in ChaCha. Again, that
doesn't mean we didn't manage to screw it up somehow, but I think it
helps! If anyone found a weakness in ChaCha, it would *probably* also
show them a weakness in BLAKE2, and vice versa.
⁴ ⁵ In sum, there has been a lot of independent analysis of BLAKE2, BLAKE,
and ChaCha, and I hope there will be more in the future. If you use a
reduced-round version of BLAKE2, you can look at these results to see
whether anyone has published an attack that would break that
reduced-round version. Of course, more rounds is safer against future
It was in that context that I recommended that ZFS use the most rounds
of BLAKE2 that it can while still being faster than Edon-R. ☺ That
will probably be around 5 rounds.
