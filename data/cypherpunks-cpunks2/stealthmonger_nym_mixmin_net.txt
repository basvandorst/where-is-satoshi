No.  If we had won, (a) new p2p acquaintances would be wary until they
had a opportunity to verify each other's keys out-of-band (having
already exchanged them on first meeting); (b) merchants would proudly
include the Key ID of their signing key in every web page, print ad,
letterhead, and customers would instinctively recognize verification
failure as the sign of an impostor; (c) banks would require customers
to identify themselves by Key ID; (d) Verisign and the other CAs would
no longer exist; (e) thinly disguized government agents like Ted Smith
would be scorned into insignificance.

Hash: SHA1
US regulators eye Bitcoin supervision [1].  See also [2,3].  Sample:
     * Senior officials at a top U.S. financial regulator are
       discussing whether Bitcoin, the controversial cybercurrency,
       might fall under their regulatory remit.
     * Bitcoin "is for sure something we need to explore," Bart
       Chilton, one of the five commissioners at the Commodity Futures
       Trading Commission told the Financial Times.  A person familiar
       with the CFTC's thinking said that the regulator is "seriously"
       examining the issue.
Now the fun begins!  Enjoy the show!  Or better yet, be part of it!

@_subject: Replacing email with XMPP...why not? 
Because it's /connection based/ and therefore low latency, so cannot be
used by an untraceable pseudonym (endpoint IP packet correlation).
Contrast with email, where the security is /message based/ and can use
anonymizing remailers having deliberately long, random latency.
