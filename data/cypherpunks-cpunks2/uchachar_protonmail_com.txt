Joshua, I think you might've missed what Mike was trying to say. With mega corporate overlords taking over control of the internet, they can deny any unpopular speech from being put on the internet just by declaring that it's "hate speech."
Literally what I just said could be counted as "hate speech" because it's such a subjective term. It's a threat to freedom of speech.

I mean. I agree it's pretty strong (I guess). However, there is so much wrong with this manifesto. It's crying out for absolute chaos and a new world order, which is very paradoxical to itself and the anarchist part. The only thing more confusing than anarchy is anarcho-socialism lol
You guys need to read "On Revolution" by Hannah Ardent. Revolts by the working class or lower are often extremely bloody and last a very very long time.
And "Capitalism & Freedom" by Milton Friedman to actually understand that Capitalism isn't all that bad if you have a small government.

It's called WiFi-Aware (Neighbor Awareness Networking A.K.A NAN). Here is a link to what it is:
I can see some privacy concerns with this stuff. I was wondering what you all thought.

No problem. I recently ordered "The Omnious Parallels" by Leonard Peikoff. Let's see how that is :)

"Don't forget that "anarchy" does not necessarily imply "chaos".  I solved that problem 22 years ago.   I'll check it out once I get back home home :)
"THAT doesn't make a bit of sense."
I'm just saying that anarco-socialism is very paradoxical to itself since the idea of socialism depends on some form of government in itself (usually with extended powers over production, distribution, etc). And that anarchy doesn't fit with it properly.
"My solution should be far faster.  How bloody it will be, it's hard to say.  People have grudges, in many cases for excellent reasons. "
Your solution is in the link above?
"I have long objected to the way people use the term "capitalism".  Capitalism is merely the 1800's term for "crowd-funding" of business.  Great advance, then.  Problem is, people use that term when what they really mean is "free market".  And no, we don't have anything close to a free market today, in America or other Western nations. "
That's true, free market/enterprise has been corrupted in every nation on this world. I personally see a free market system to yield good results for the well-being of a country it is allowed to stay free.

No idea what you meant by your last Milton Friedman remark. Maybe you're trying to reference to my suggestion of Friedman. However, Capitalism got murdered in the recent years because of the left's unending desire for big government.
P.S: it's even more interesting seeing that it's coming from a " address lol

Completely agree. Most of these "certifications" are one way for corporate overlords to drain more money, and usually just keep pumping out more and more script kiddies (if that).

Depends on what you're reinstalling.
I prefer Arch Linux or Slackware (because of security specific updates), once installed (the bare minimum system) I harden it by auditing the system itself, and then I keep an ever watchful eye on advisories. Windows is a virus itself tbh.
