 Mr. Carboni,
Thank you for providing the information below.  We have conducted an
initial search within the organization that is most likely to hold records.
That organization advised that the request, as worded, is overly broad.
Querying any of our organizations would likely result in the same
response.  The phrase “malware transmitted through USB firmware” is overly
broad, such that any of our internal organizations would not be able to
determine which files to search or be able to conduct a search with a
reasonable amount of effort. Terms such as “malware” or “firmware” may turn
up in any number of NSA records and most likely would not be related to
securing home networks. Furthermore, added search without a clarification
of context and specific records sought, would incur significant fees which
would be passed on to you as an “all other” requester.
  A large facet of the NSA/CSS mission is to protect National Security
(i.e. government, DoD, Industry partners) information systems.  In doing
so, this Agency provides guidance on Information Assurance security
solutions to our Industry and Government customers regarding risk,
vulnerabilities, mitigations, and threats.  While it is not part of our
mission to provide guidance on securing home networks, we may occasionally
post information on our website as you may recall from our letter. Our
Information Assurance Directorate (IAD) has provided some information to
the public that may be of interest to you.  Here are some additional links
that you may peruse:
(this is a recent article the does provides a link regarding malware)
  The last paragraph provides a video
link under “IAD's Latest Security Guide Helps Customers Protect Home
Networks,” and there is also a fact sheet titled “Best Practices for
Keeping Your Home Network Secure.” Since the information you appear to be
requesting (protecting home networks) does not fall under the purview of
NSA/CSS missions, continued search of our files would not be productive.
Your request will be administratively closed as an improper FOIA.  If,
after reviewing the information on our website, you wish to submit a FOIA
request on similar topic(s), please provide enough detail to allow for an
accurate and focused search.

That's true. But they do in fact do research into malware, and it is infact
my right to request information for "personal noncommercial use" which

If the government produced records on how to best design a tree house, I am
still allowed to request records on how to build a tree house. I cannot
force them to create new records, but for records they have already
produced, they have the duty and obligation to make a reasonable search.

Chomsky seems to be doing quite well for himself, so I doubt this Rogaway

I think I will write on how cryptography is not a science.

@_date: 2015-12-05 15:13:21
@_author: Ryan Carboni 
@_subject: Cryptography is not a science currently 
Recently The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work was published online by
Philip Rogaway.
I am going to explain that the disciplinary culture of cryptography is not
a scientific discipline. Cryptography itself is a science. Cryptography in
many respects is the inverse of forensic science, while forensics follow a
protocol, their results are no better than guessing. While cryptography's
results are concrete, the culture is a serious failure.
Cryptographers are well aware of the moral implications of their work...
since Diffie and Hellman condemned DES's short key length (
 ). If according to Rogaway,
"Most academic cryptographers seem to think that our field is a fun, deep,
and politically neutral game—a set of puzzles involving communicating
parties and notional adversaries", the fault is not with most
cryptographers, but with all cryptographers.
Paranoid fear surrounded the AES competition, that a cipher might have a
backdoor (it turns out backdooring ciphers are more difficult than
expected). Yet after the AES report turns out the full of lies (
 ), that additions are
more vulnerable to timing attacks then... table lookups, one should do some
critical self analysis.
That a cryptographer calls for some sort of self-analysis long after the
AES competition, the SHA-3 competition, basically after all the currently
accepted ciphers have become entrenched is alarming.
Each and every cryptographer seems to fail to understand what the US
intelligence community actually does. They truly do, they do not seem to
understand that for anyone of import, they'd develop biographies on people,
if one is important enough, they might create a psychological profile.
Maybe this sounds paranoid. But given that the greatest intelligence
scandals involve what is believed to be true to be absolutely false and
what is believed to be false to be absolutely true, paranoia is to be
expected if the state takes an interest in your profession.
And all cryptographers know that the state is interested in cryptography.
What about the constant struggles of cryptographers getting their papers
published in the seventies and eighties? Maybe only Dan Bernstein remembers
that he went to court just to publish his own cipher.
Naturally for Philip Rogaway, these issues came to a head after the Snowden
disclosures (I'm still waiting for the next drip). For anyone to discredit
themselves in the first paragraph of a forty-six page PDF is amazing.
Potentially if all cryptographers somehow manage to ignore this immense
logical failing is an indictment against the entire cryptographic
profession. Especially given that it is commonly accepted that mathematics
requires logic.
Truly Rogaway is the Chomsky of Cryptography. Chomsky will deny the
Cambodian holocaust and claim that oppression in the US "isn't that bad".
For anyone to run out and say they are taking on the elite without knowing
a damn thing about anything, I wish them a lot of luck.
I might as well post a modest suggestion: cryptographers should support an
FPGA integrated into the CPU or the ability to use integrated graphics for
cryptography. This would remove entrenchment of standards, and allow people
to pick their own ciphers. It's possible the AES-NI instructions were
developed after the NSA panicked at seeing AES usage in TLS drop rapidly
after the timing attacks were revealed. The AES-NI instructions are
overkill, and seem to take CISC too literally. One only needs,
mixcolumn+subbytes, subbyte, reverse+mixcolumn+subbytes, AESIMC and
subbytes instructions of 32-bit sizes each (no need for AESENC, AESENCLAST,
AESKEYGENASSIST, AESDECLAST, AESDEC, AESIMC), it would save one
instruction, and the instruction will use only one operand. The way the
AES-NI instructions are designed precludes usage for Rijndael with 256 bit
blocks, and it seems odd that the AES-NI instructions only accept data from
the XMM registers.
Rigidity should be viewed with suspicion.

People talk badly about Hoover, but never about the CIA? Given the powers
of the FBI, Hoover was nothing like L. Ron Hubbard, Nixon, or Beria. The
CIA on the other hand.... stole a hard drive.
This year. Hoover's FBI constantly talked about discretion, and people even
wrote to Hoover! Some villain he is. He even blackmailed the elites, which
is pretty terrible. Strange that a senile war criminal like Ronald Reagan
is more admired than J. Edgar Hoover, true American hero.
 I assume Google now encrypts everything everywhere inside the corporation.
Excellent, except why didn't all the targets in Prism join all at the same
time?  I guess each corporation's plaintext are just that hard to crack,
they had to work a year per company to break their plaintext. Maybe instead
of encryption they should change their plaintext encoding? Maybe for
additional security everyone should proprietary plaintext?
So when the Snowden papers came out 20 years later they suddenly realized
Snowden isn't such a big deal.
Maybe no one cares about Nicholas Merril and his fight against a national
security letter.
Maybe no one cares about Mark Klein, or that Congress gave retroactive
immunity to telecommunications providers in cooperating with the government.
Maybe no one cares that Theo de Raadt lost a DARPA grant for criticizing
the Iraq war.
Maybe no one cares...
Why am I wasting my time? There are thousands of events that transpired
before Snowden, and Snowden is a big deal? How is he a big deal? If you
didn't know the NSA was spying on everyone before Snowden, you're a moron
or a shill. There's no respectful way to get this point across, it's
abundantly clear to anyone with half a brain and pays attention to anything
that this is all public knowledge. To pretend that there was some big
secret before Snowden is ridiculous. The only interesting new bit of
knowledge in 2013 was parallel construction. I had no idea that the federal
government was */that/* crooked.

Erm... it's possible to learn by watching enough CCC videos of

The logistics of it is impossible to hide. They have satellites next to
satellites to intercept data. The FBI has thirty thousand employees (and
operates DITU). The NSA has five times the budget and same number of
employees. The CIA has seven times the budget and twenty thousand
employees. This is just the US, the rest of Five Eyes puts in their fair
share as well.
To ensure staying on the topic of cryptography, how many cryptographers do
you think there are? Given the discovery of high level spies within
intelligence agencies (Redl, Ames, Hanssen), how could cryptographers hope
to assure security if the top spies can't? It has been alleged that
activist groups had been penetrated and the course of discussion
manipulated. If one million dollars per year is spent towards manipulating
cryptography, how would you think it would be used?
The only secure place is your brain. If you can think for yourself, then
you know your own thoughts are secure. Groupthink is the original cloud
Naturally, Rogaway doesn't mention any of this. He makes no frank
assessment of risks and possibilities. And I am the only person to engage

It would be trivial to hack into any such devices used by government

additional security everyone should proprietary plaintext?
So when the Snowden papers came out 20 years later they suddenly realized
Snowden isn't such a big deal.
Maybe no one cares about Nicholas Merril and his fight against a national
security letter.
Maybe no one cares about Mark Klein, or that Congress gave retroactive
immunity to telecommunications providers in cooperating with the government.
Maybe no one cares that Theo de Raadt lost a DARPA grant for criticizing
the Iraq war.
Maybe no one cares...
Why am I wasting my time? There are thousands of events that transpired
before Snowden, and Snowden is a big deal? How is he a big deal? If you
didn't know the NSA was spying on everyone before Snowden, you're a moron
or a shill. There's no respectful way to get this point across, it's
abundantly clear to anyone with half a brain and pays attention to anything
that this is all public knowledge. To pretend that there was some big
secret before Snowden is ridiculous. The only interesting new bit of
knowledge in 2013 was parallel construction. I had no idea that the federal
government was */that/* crooked.

We live in a democracy afterall.
Erm... it's possible to learn by watching enough CCC videos of
presentations to know all about the NSA and other five eyes intelligence.
The logistics of it is impossible to hide. They have satellites next to
satellites to intercept data. The FBI has thirty thousand employees (and
operates DITU). The NSA has five times the budget and same number of
employees. The CIA has seven times the budget and twenty thousand
employees. This is just the US, the rest of Five Eyes puts in their fair
share as well.
To ensure staying on the topic of cryptography, how many cryptographers do
you think there are? Given the discovery of high level spies within
intelligence agencies (Redl, Ames, Hanssen), how could cryptographers hope
to assure security if the top spies can't? It has been alleged that
activist groups had been penetrated and the course of discussion
manipulated. If one million dollars per year is spent towards manipulating
cryptography, how would you think it would be used?

Most consumer routers and modems are outdated, and use firmware that's
never or rarely updated.
It would be trivial to hack into any such devices used by government
employees at home and correlate the user to a database to gather additional
information on them.
Can foreign governments still teach blackmailed government employees how to

Seems like counterintelligence investigations now need to include labor

first heard that the guy was executed by his henchmen. After he saw the

It just simply doesn't matter.
To have a modern lifestyle, depends upon having devices of dubious or poor
security. The government has shown a willingness to accumulate dossiers
(seemingly including IRC chats), and then leak them when it serves their
own needs.
Our Congress is criminally incompetent. The chairman of the House Oversight
committee just had his secret service application leaked, and there is no
threat of the the most powerful tools that Congress has: appropriations
micromanagement (famously done in Congressional reconstruction) or
impeachment. The same goes for Benghazi (which probably was a meeting with
a rebel group that went sour). I think our government is more malicious and
less competent than Hoover's FBI.
For comparison:
“Another early Bureau practice was to index names on lists when the list
reflected possible association with a subversive group (e.g. Communist
Party petitions or subscriptions to the Daily People's World), or where the
names might have future reference value (American Legion contacts, loyalty
forms). The heavy demands on staff time and resources, however, and the
absence of substantial information about the individuals whose names
appeared in the this context caused the Bureau to limit indexing in these
areas. In 1949 the Executive Conference decided that names on Communist
Party petitions and subscription lists to the Daily Worker and Daily
People's World be indexed in the appropriate field office only.”

"I request the audio of the last Challenger shuttle mission. The
privacy interests since the New York Times v. NASA suit has
diminished, particularly after it was widely reported that they were
still alive and trapped within the shuttle. There remains a public
interest in knowing exactly when the astronauts died."
"I request records prepared for the 01-27-16 press conference
regarding Malheur Wildwife Refuge.
Greg Bretzing, SAC of the FBI Portland Field Office, made a statement
that the occupiers were outsiders, while wearing a wind breaker. I
infer that the statement was made based on advice from the Behavioral
Analysis Unit. The fact that the BAU assists in Media Strategies has
been publicly acknowledged in books by former FBI agents and on
federal government websites. The law enforcement exemption can only be
applied in limited circumstances with specificity, such as a specific
investigation. There is also a public interest in knowing how the
government is crafting messages for public consumption."
"I request statistics from 2001 to 2015 estimating the number of
individuals who have lost their security clearance because it was
discovered through a polygraph that they are not comfortable with
their work (including, but not limited to, a moral, ethical, or
emotional comfort). I believe that the DNI centrally compiles this or

ten times will be considered legal and reasonable.
It is not hard to figure out the reasoning behind these instructions. It is
hard to figure out why I'm giving them, as opposed to those ACLU executives
getting paid quarter million salaries. Or police oversight agencies.
No it's actually quite simple.
The Russians are running everything, and have implemented full communism.
I suggest that the ACLU and the EFF be liquidated into a non profit I run

And I will not seek to be a single point of failure.
Afterall, I reasonably believe that Edward Snowden has betrayed the ACLU,
by having Witte act as a secretary, meaning that the ACLU is not acting as
law firm for Snowden.
I think it's over, you know, the weeks when they have times, to get lawyers

The AES round function for instance is not the most optimal, just altering
add round key (Transposition of AES Key Schedule) can significantly improve
security. While cryptanalyzing one cipher is hard enough, cryptoanalyzing
any minor change in construction would be very difficult. Times have
changed since the only good cipher was DES, and cryptographers were
examining alternative DES constructions such as Ladder-DES proposed on
sci.crypt. It was a good thing that the Threefish team had to justify their
design decisions since it was very hard to prove security for an ARX cipher.
It still becomes an open question as to whether current knowledge is being
applied most optimally.
Just how much additional security does a tweakable block cipher provide?
Would Madryga even be secure under a tweak construction?
Would a CBC-MAC be immune to Simon’s algorithm if it was truncated?
Wouldn't for wide block encryption, instead of Bear and Lion, be better to
just use an envelope MAC over the plaintext and use half of the MAC output
as the encryption key and the other half as the MAC? Actually ZFS does
something similar.... A search for "zfs" on iacr doesn't reveal anything.
Could the Simon cipher use a stronger 3 to 1 function? Reuse the same

The AES round function for instance is not the most optimal, just altering
add round key (Transposition of AES Key Schedule) can significantly improve
security. While cryptanalyzing one cipher is hard enough, cryptoanalyzing
any minor change in construction would be very difficult. Times have
changed since the only good cipher was DES, and cryptographers were
examining alternative DES constructions such as Ladder-DES proposed on
sci.crypt. It was a good thing that the Threefish team had to justify their
design decisions since it was very hard to prove security for an ARX cipher.
It still becomes an open question as to whether current knowledge is being
applied most optimally.
Just how much additional security does a tweakable block cipher provide?
Would Madryga even be secure under a tweak construction?
Would a CBC-MAC be immune to Simon’s algorithm if it was truncated?
Wouldn't for wide block encryption, instead of Bear and Lion, be better to
just use an envelope MAC over the plaintext and use half of the MAC output
as the encryption key and the other half as the MAC? Actually ZFS does
something similar.... A search for "zfs" on iacr doesn't reveal anything.
Could the Simon cipher use a stronger 3 to 1 function? Reuse the same
function for the key schedule?

Pakistani diplomats)
When you ship alcohol, many states require showing ID proving the recipient

they take a step further and petition their representatives to make their

@_subject: new idea for random number generation 
I am reminded of an anecdote (of which, our entire history books are made
up of):
I have played a lot of Dungeons and Dragons, and related, games in my life.
Rolling dice are an intrinsic part of such games, because they allow
unusual things to happen, unusual results that surprise and amaze. Dice
also give people the illusion of control over Fate...dice are random, yet
people often feel like they are able to 'control' the probabilities, in a
kind of real magick, some unexplained ability. When highly improbable
events with dice occur, it is easy to believe such nonsense. Or perhaps we
humans can affect probability...I will let you be the judge, for yourself.
One time, during my days as a paid, professional DM, I had been running a
free game for some people I was involved with at the time, and the brother
of the person I was most involved with at the time came up to me and made a
rather incredible statement.
His friend was visiting, had heard of what fame I had back in those days,
and wanted to meet me...and by the way, this friend could ALWAYS roll
within one number of any target on a 20 sided die.  Without fail. On any
die. Any time.
Sheah, my ass! Still, since the fellow was visiting, and since it really
would not take any time to see for myself, and since he was a big fan of
mine, I agreed to put up with whatever farce would be tossed to me.
The first five or six rolls, each on a different die from my personal
collection were all perfect and exact. The value '20', time after time.
Then I borrowed the dice collection of an observing friend, doubting my own
dice, despite the fact that I had painted them myself (you had to in those
days) and knew my own dice inside and out (I have an enormous collection of
polyhedral dice). The next five or six rolled I called at random....just
picking numbers out of the blue. Whether it was an 18, or a 3, or a 12, or
20 again....this young man always, and without fail, on any die I gave him,
(so long as it was a twenty-sided die, he could not do it on any other die)
he could roll within one number. When I called 18, as I remember, he rolled
17, for instance. He never missed, not even once, and I must have tested
him several dozen times. I wanted more, but he was getting bored, besides,
I had run out of fresh, new d20's to use. We used every d20 anyone had. I
would not repeat using the same die, trying to see if somehow the dice were
He did not know how he did this trick. He just noticed, one day, that he
could do it. He was not that amazed by it anymore. He had been doing it for

I am glad I did not, in retrospect.
To this day I have no explanation whatsoever for what I saw. I tested the
lads claim as carefully as I could, given the situation, and there was no
shortage of witnesses from every angle. He did not palm the die, or do
anything odd....several times I asked him to simply hold out his hand, palm
up, where I deposited a d20, and had him just roll the die off of his palm,
without closing his fingers. Just let the die fall off and hit the table.
It made no difference.

whatever it was that he could do.

I've previously written about there was only a 40% chance OJ killed his

It also leads to arguments about how arguments on parallel construction is
not convincing, those arguments pretty much boil down to the government is
being suspiciously secretive and illegally dishonest.
I found the arguments on parallel construction to be more convincing than
the Clipper chip though, but upon further thought, I'm not longer convinced
by current arguments against parallel construction. The defendant still
committed the crime (ignoring selective enforcement), it is just that
classified information is used as hints to find a different set of
evidence. They were proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, a very high
bar to meet.
Or is it a very high bar to meet? The ACLU, the great absolutionists of our
time, insist on no death penalty. Because based on the number of people who
were exonerated before ever being executed should have instead been
sentenced to life imprisonment, who if exonerated, would still be released?
Well ignoring that, there is an alarming number of people convicted beyond
a reasonable doubt. Based on some circumstantial evidence here, prior
relationship there, lack of alibi, and having the same blood type (although
thanks to CSI, more exacting and numerous tests are demanded now), and you
have a pretty convincing story (which is all it takes).
Obviously the proper argument is to find that all murderers were
incorrectly convicted and should be retried under stricter procedures.
Everyone bemoans that Matthew Keys was convicted by... a jury. We have
fallen far, far, below our desired standard for "... ten guilty persons
escape than that one innocent suffer".
My argument about parallel construction is different, the defendants should
have access to classified information to prove their innocence if there is
a large scale program by the government to prove guilt using classified
information. It could give an edge to the defendant to find that one
pattern or one bit of evidence that would throw doubt onto the
prosecution's case. Because the defendant is not presumed innocent. If
there is no doubt as to the prosecution's case, the jury will convict, do
not delude yourself otherwise.

This talk about free speech runs contrary to libertarian values about not

principle, and so the risk of people entering a space to experience

The legend of the Special Forces Underground reaches back to the same
period. The story is that President Kennedy, an outspoken critic of the
military-industrial complex, pulled selected Special Forces officers aside
when he visited Fort Bragg in October of 1961. In a very informal
conversation he asked these officers to promise that if the US military was
ever used against the people of the United States the men of the Special
Forces would use their very unique training to assist the people. According
to the legend, this promise has been passed down through the decades to
some of the soldiers wearing the Green Beret today. These men make up what
the media and DOD investigations have referred to as “The Special Forces

Due to inflation my opinion has increased in value from two to three cents.
This talk about free speech runs contrary to libertarian values about not
having borders. Offending people is not protected by the non-aggression
principle, and so the risk of people entering a space to experience
undesired speech is too great a risk. As the number of rights expand, so
must the number of freedoms decrease.
It is too far to call the Daily Stormer vitriolic and abusive, it is
clearly only in bad taste and puerile. For some reason after the Reagan
administration, everyone became more puritan, and no one can even directly
discuss any subject matter so I will say it: Calling anyone who died a fat
slut is far outside civilized speech, and is certainly not something to be
joked about in public.
Yes, what GoDaddy, Google, and Cloudflare did was dangerous. So did what
Obama did (
). Yes, it is terrible that states and malicious actors censors others
through DDOS attacks, why are DDOS attacks ignored as speech? Those state
owned computers should be blocked from the internet.
I too agree with net neutrality and think "internet intermediaries"
shouldn't make much content based decisions, outside of that needed to

Cain’s attorney, Bill Seki, has denied his client had any knowledge of the
thefts. Seki has repeatedly accused the LAPD of using Cain as a “scapegoat”
and contends other officers were aware that the vehicles had been taken.
“They’re still trying to throw it at him, the easy target, protecting
others that would have been aware of it,” he said.
Basically he is pointing out the disingenuity of it all. I believe the ACLU

increased numbers of prosecutions of police brutality cases, and yet so
many times these cases yield not guilty verdicts. Even in the case where a

understood and should be avoided. For the entropy estimate only counts the
entropy of individual events, but not the total combinatorial complexity.
Since operating systems have no real time guarantee, and all entropy is a
product of unobserved events, the order in which events occur certainly
adds entropy. Given that combinatorial complexity is not factored in
entropy estimates, the entropy estimate should be considered flawed.
In fact, this combinatorial complexity significantly impacts one's ability
to manipulate the output of the generator without knowing the full state,
and it might be dangerous for /dev/random/ to treat any source of entropy
as 8 bits per byte.

Now Best has been writing quite a bit about spicy topics regarding the CIA.
But how does a limited hangout work, and when you see it in action, why is
it so effective? It is quite a mystery why no one has espoused this in
plain English. A limited hangout serves to satisfy people's curiosity in
predominant narratives or explanations in what is going on. It is only by
merely being curious that you can succeed against limited hangouts.
Sometimes a limited hangout serves multiple ends, it may even operate as
framing (  ),
and how something is framed can also display different points with the same
message to different audiences.
But to go into detail ( see attachment for PDF of article "One of the CIA’s
private press contacts was a suspected Soviet spy" ), this article presents
the best example of limited hangouts. It frames Tad Szulc's possible
communist ties as a surprise. Automatically one thinks that this was an
unfortunate situation, that the agency would have to disclose classified
information to make a case, or to at least tell the New York Times that he
shouldn't be allowed to deal with certain matters.
Now I guess Best can't help that some people form those sorts of initial
conclusions. You know how people treat responsibility, how the law treats
responsibility. It's just an unfortunate thing.
But the New York Times is clearly and obvious a pro-communist publication.
To digress, every liberal publication was repeating the same story from
Pyongyang on Otto Warmbier. But the New York Times has done worse than
defend trumped up charges on a poor kid. The matter of Walter Duranty is
available to anyone over the internet. Defended what is now known as the
Holodomor, which ranks around the Holocaust in deaths. He defended Stalin's
show trials.
His name was maintained on a list by George Orwell (!) as a person
unsuitable as a possible writer for the Foreign Office's Information
Research Department. And here's Sculc's real scoop :
 He wrote an article about "Anti-Castro units trained to fight at Florida
bases". Best mumbles about Sculc writing about AMTRUNK, but he leaked the
Bay of Pigs! Who is responsible for the Bay of Pigs disaster? Well, I
googled for what the CIA officially says, and they don't say anything about
Szulc (
In fact, I googled "new york times communist" I get this article:

Similar cases re-occur by numerous dishonest individuals, even those not
closely associated with the New York Times, Chomsky defends Pol Pot as not

There is no easier way to tweak the nose of a commie by defending

It's hard to say whether it should be surprising that Operation Northwoods
was committed to paper on government letterhead. An official government
document proposing terrorism against the American people. And throughout
history there were 53 admitted false flags:
 .
So it becomes fair to wonder what was so big about anthrax, and why Matt
deHart had to be arrested on trumped up charges.
On Page 88 of Part 10 of 59 on the FBI's released Amerithrax investigation,
a psychological profile without letterhead is provided. There are also
presumably letters from Ivins against fat people near the beginning of the
PDF file.
But if the CIA was responsible, would the FBI know, or would they have been
just doing their jobs? It's a pretty power argument for people just doing
their jobs when virtually every Nazi gave it as a reason. You'd have the
BAU giving facially a specific profile, but in reality about 1% or so would
qualify, so it'd fall under Schneier's arguments for no terrorist catching
system is effective (although clearly it won't be completely automated).
Then you'd have field agents under pressure to solve the case, they might
just be rationalizing why what their doing is correct.
For all it takes for Bruce Ivins to be falsely accused is for the CIA to
stay mum, and for the FBI to do their jobs?
In proportion to the punishment, murder convictions are inaccurate, one in
nine are exonerated based on retested DNA evidence. The CSI effect is quite
fortunate, or that rate would be higher, the police only gather enough
evidence to ensure a conviction, not to ensure they don't have an innocent
person. The probability that OJ was guilty was in all fairness, 40%.
Another 40% it was Jason. 20% it could've been anyone else. Legally, no
prosecution for murder should succeed by official standards.

No longer the niche concern of years past, Linux today underpins the server
farms that run the cloud, more than a billion Android phones, and not to
mention the coming tsunami of grossly insecure devices that will be hitched
to the Internet of Things. Today's world runs on Linux, and the security of
its kernel is a single point of failure that will affect the safety and
well-being of almost every human being on the planet in one way or another.

Connection number two is that Morris Ernst was J. Edgar Hoover's close

ACLU. There has been very little said on this topic.
Connection number three is that J.P. Barlow, founder of the EFF was
contacted by Robert Steele in 1992 (currently believes there is a child sex
slave colony on Mars) to speak at an intelligence conference.
  (but
it was pretty prescient "Nonetheless, I sallied forth, confidently telling

The Arms for Libya case ensued when a gang of CIA deep state operatives
were caught shipping a huge amount of weapons and explosives to Libya.
Edwin Wilson was hung out to dry by Ted Shackley and the rest of the cabal.
After a FOIA request revealed the CIA knew perfectly well what he was
doing, he was released after about 17 years in jail. He was never given
compensation and those responsible for the cover up were never brought to
Before his 1980 retirement, the CIA Inspector General John H. Waller
produced an internal investigation which exonerated Theodore Shackley and
his "career-long deputy and sidekick" Thomas Clines. This was the CIA's
official story for about 20 years, endorsed by Waller's successor, the man in the CIA, Charles A. Briggs who was called on to testify in Edwin
Wilson's court case. The CIA had blocked the defense from gaining access to
any contradictory paperwork, so the jury apparently believed the (perjured)
'Briggs Declaration' which said that Edwin Wilson has independently
collected almost the entire US stockpile of C-4 (plastic explosive) and
arranged to fly it to Libya, all without CIA knowledge, following up by
sending US troops to train of Muammar Gaddafi's military in bomb making,
and sold them a bunch of other weapons. This official narrative fell apart
about 20 years later when an internal document surfaced which proved that
the CIA Inspector Generals had been lying.
Frank Terpil was tried and found guilty in absentia. Douglas Schlachter
plead guilty to two charges in a plea deal, after providing testimony
directly linking Wilson to "senior Central Intelligence officials"
(presumably Ted Shackley and his sidekick Thomas Clines, who in 1981 both
admitted that they had kept in touch with Wilson, though they denied
knowing anything about the arms deals). Edwin Wilson was hung out to dry
and charged as the main culprit.
CIA officer, Edwin Wilson, brokered a number of weapons deals to Libya.
Michael Ruppert wrote that Wilson lived in Libya "for extended periods
between 1977 and 1981". The most extraordinary of these deals was in 1977,
when a 42,000 pound load of C-4 plastic explosive (an amount which
represented almost the entire US domestic supply) was flown out of Houston
International Airport to Muammar Gaddafi's Libya, followed by training in
bomb making by US Green Berets. Subsequent deals involved handguns and
other weapons. A scheme to ship more than a thousand M16 rifles to Gaddafi
put the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms onto Edwin Wilson back in
late 1977.
After about 17 years in jail, FOIA requests by Edwin Wilson came across
some internal paperwork which proved that those involved in the case knew
that the "Briggs Affidavit" was a lie. These sufficed to allow Wilson to
successfully appeal his conviction. In October 2003, his conviction on the
explosives charge was overturned and Wilson was released from prison on
September 14, 2004. He launched a legal claim for compensation against
those who perjured evidence against him, and those who knowingly stayed
silent on the matter, but they were granted legal immunity and he never
received compensation.
Copyright The CIA did a lot of dirty things. If Snowden was a Russian agent, not a
CIA agent, why was he insistent on protecting the CIA? The CIA did a lot of

hundreds of US government employees spent innumerable man-years dealing
with the aftermath of Snowden, but it served no real point.

Russia, there were allegations that he provided information that allowed
the U-2 to be shot down. More recently, CIA militias in Syria are fighting
Pentagon militias in Syria (

Department's peace deal with Russia. This has been characterized many ways,
Cowboy vs Yankee War, Moldbug's Red Empire vs Blue Empire. There is
certainly some sort of internal antagonism being played out in the world.
Regardless, nothing is quite what it seems, and searching for the truth is
unrewarding. Better to find it at the bottom of a bottle.

Okay, I'll give you an answer: The CIA is set up so that it's impossible
for a person as an individual to arrogate to himself the right to lie to a
congressional committee or to anyone else. But what he can or cannot say is
clearly specified from the day he is sworn in. He can lie to people who are
not his bosses, who do not have security clearances. Most congressmen do
not have security clearances. When Senator Frank Church asked me something,
and he said, "Will you take an oath," I said, "Senator, I'll take the oath,
and I wouldn't think of telling you the truth." Personally, I like Colby
very much. He's a very fine man, but he's just the wrong kind of guy to be

For unknown reasons, this has been totally forgotten. Fortunately we rely

historical government lies to the public, that'd make your brain lame.

If you read Miles Copeland's interview, you can understand how Snowden the

until the Public Support Test needs to be fulfilled. 5/6 of First Look's

Recently First Look has been reorganized a bit. Well, as a media
publication on the media says about it:
Topic.com is the product of First Look Media’s titular entertainment
studio, Topic, which officially went live earlier this year. Unlike the
nonprofit operations at First Look Media, like The Intercept, Topic and its
related operations are charged with building the company’s revenue
operations in part by financing and distributing independent projects such
as the documentary Nobody Speaks, which follows the Hulk Hogan trial that
helped take down Gawker. The documentary premiered on Netflix this month.
Topic itself is platform-agnostic: its productions will live on a variety
of platforms, including movie theater screens, podcast apps, television,
and, of course, Facebook and Twitter.
Looking at the staff of the for-profit First Look shows that it shares no
(or nearly no) staff with the non-profit first look.
Based on what I've read, I can guess that First Look and First Look are
unrelated organizations.
(unless as a foundation, maybe) unless *squints* it is selling
advertisements that further its program service like... a bar association
magazine to quote: "A bar association publishes a legal journal containing
opinions of the county court, articles of professional interest to lawyers,
advertisements for products and services used by the legal profession, and
legal notices. The legal notices are published to satisfy state laws
requiring publication of notices in connection with legal proceedings, such
as the administration of estates and actions to quiet title to real
So it isn't hard to see how First Look and First Look are unrelated in a
purely irrational sense. Recently First Look began asking for donations

Of course, public support requires essentially at least a third of all
money come from individuals providing less than 2% each. An interesting
question is if Pierre Omidyar offered to triple everyone's donations
(+200%), and had a few friends donate a few thousand dollars each that he
wouldn't triple. Would it qualify as public support? Probably. All this
seems very elaborate and rather silly.
Let's look at the ACLU. It uh. Has a related nonprofit foundation to fund
itself and it's affiliates.
Anyway, mimicry is stupid, but informed mimicry can improve one's own
survival function. I've said something about orienting the network of
privacy non-profits towards actually accomplishing things. You know
SuperPACs have a wink-wink relationship with their candidate.
And here is the reorganization of First Look, they hide the truth through
some pretty sophisticated means. You want to improve privacy, create
devices under the control of the public? Here's the blueprint.
Get a bunch of people together who are on the same page. Create for-profit
and non-profit corporations who aren't related. The designs and code must
be open-source to prevent co-option and unnecessary risk that corporation
could dominate and render the others irrelevant.
Pretty short blueprint huh? Wonder why no one hasn't come up with this
before... oh wait. Credit goes to Omidyar. The people in charge of your
freedom are not on your side. Only you can manufacture freedom.

Well, two scenes to be exact. The first scene was the new editor ordering
the journalists to investigate a case. The second scene was that the paper
did write about child molestation allegations in the past, but they put it
into the metro section. How easily are people manipulated? These
journalists went on to win prizes for their reporting, so clearly they are
not responsible for their own success. These are exceptional allegations,
the metro article was about a dozen alleged cases? Then it turned out to be
hundreds of children?
The part that really disturbed me is that no one reflected on this. This is
a thing that happened. The journalists unwittingly allowed it to occur.
Cardinal Law wittingly allowed it to occur.
The truth is out there. It is not hard to find.
Actually, all the journalists, with their intelligence contacts... they
have to be itching to ask one question. How could so many people in the
intelligence community be okay with the popular outrage from Snowden? How
do they rationalize it? Well. I don't know, but I think they are naive
enough to ignore past misdeeds, and they get told various things. Like how
it was Clapper's duty to lie to Congress (!) because no comment or this
should be in a closed hearing would be too suspicious. How could it be that
they think what they are doing is legal, but we think that hiding
information from the public is suspicious and sign of illegality? Maybe the
government does incidental collection with disk images and wiretaps on an
alarming scale. Maybe... maybe....

Such characters are a researcher's nemesis; they are meant to be. When the
CIA or other intelligence agencies need to hire a "contractor," who may be
required to carry out taks that are potentially dangerous and of
questionable legality, they look for three things: a specific and useful
skill (a knowledge of money-laundering, perhaps); a romantic streak that
glorifies both the secrecy and the risk; and a propensity for exageration
and trouble. One former CIA officer, David MacMichael, has said that the
agency looks for these freelancers at small community airports and gun
ranges - places where men go to excape the boredom of everyday life.
Looking for adventure, these men are fascinated by the imagined glamour and
excitement of the world of espionage. MacMichael said that often, after one
or two assignments, the agency will put a contractor on a case in which he
runs afoul of the law. The contractor finds himself in a compromising
position - nothing so major as to put him permanently out of commission,
but significant enough that if he ever starts telling tales out of school
about covert operations, his record will discredit his testimony.
Take, for instance, the case of Delmart Vreeland. A scoundrel by every
account, but also one with exceptional information for those with ears to
hear. He did pass on the "Let one happen, stop the rest" warning from a
Toronto jail cell before 9/11; his claim that Canadian diplomat Marc
Bastien had been poisoned in Moscow has been proven correct; the Pentagon
unwittingly acknowledged his lengthy service record when it was called in
open court, by relying on archived records undamaged by the 9/11 attack
from which he had not been purged (the prosecution argued, incredibly, that
Vreeland must have hacked into the Pentgon files from his jail cell); Leo
Wanta, longtime intelligence asset who destabilized the Soviet ruble in the
'80s at the White House request, confirmed Vreeland was an operative of the
Office of Naval Intelligence; his lawyers did receive death threats and
found their files vandalized; and Vreeland has vanished.
But none of that matters to the coincidentalists, who stubbornly refuse to
see deeper than the "legends" created for men like Vreeland, which is
precisely the point. So Lee Harvey Oswald is a "communist," and Barry Seal
just a drug runner. That Oswald was seen with the CIA's David Atlee
Phillips in September 1963, and Barry Seal was gunned down with Vice
President George Bush's personal phone number in his trunk, need to be
ignored. The coincidentalists can't make sense of such evidence, that
respectable men would have anything to do with such characters. But without
them, some respectable men would be able to do very little.
Well, Vreeland had since the essay been written, convicted of soliciting
child prostitution in Franklin County, which is a bit messed up if you
heard the backstory of Franklin County.
The moment we live in a free society is probably when Kiriakou is working
at an Apple Store and is visited by the Attorney General and when Thomas
Drake has a fellowship with a major think tank, and it is when Delmart
Vreeland is a free man not on trumped up charges.

Muckrock has long been publishing the writings of Michael Best, now Emma
Best. I have previously pointed out that Muckrock is unwilling to
contradict the powerful, who as I pointed out, includes John Young of
Now Best has been writing quite a bit about spicy topics regarding the CIA.
But how does a limited hangout work, and when you see it in action, why is
it so effective? It is quite a mystery why no one has espoused this in
plain English. A limited hangout serves to satisfy people's curiosity in
predominant narratives or explanations in what is going on. It is only by
merely being curious that you can succeed against limited hangouts.
Sometimes a limited hangout serves multiple ends, it may even operate as
framing (  ),
and how something is framed can also display different points with the same
message to different audiences.
But to go into detail ( see attachment for PDF of article "One of the CIA’s
private press contacts was a suspected Soviet spy" ), this article presents
the best example of limited hangouts. It frames Tad Szulc's possible
communist ties as a surprise. Automatically one thinks that this was an
unfortunate situation, that the agency would have to disclose classified
information to make a case, or to at least tell the New York Times that he
shouldn't be allowed to deal with certain matters.
Now I guess Best can't help that some people form those sorts of initial
conclusions. You know how people treat responsibility, how the law treats
responsibility. It's just an unfortunate thing.
But the New York Times is clearly and obvious a pro-communist publication.
To digress, every liberal publication was repeating the same story from
Pyongyang on Otto Warmbier. But the New York Times has done worse than
defend trumped up charges on a poor kid. The matter of Walter Duranty is
available to anyone over the internet. Defended what is now known as the
Holodomor, which ranks around the Holocaust in deaths. He defended Stalin's
show trials.
His name was maintained on a list by George Orwell (!) as a person
unsuitable as a possible writer for the Foreign Office's Information
Research Department. And here's Sculc's real scoop :
 He wrote an article about "Anti-Castro units trained to fight at Florida
bases". Best mumbles about Sculc writing about AMTRUNK, but he leaked the
Bay of Pigs! Who is responsible for the Bay of Pigs disaster? Well, I
googled for what the CIA officially says, and they don't say anything about
Szulc (
In fact, I googled "new york times communist" I get this article:
Still, more examples can be found here:
Similar cases re-occur by numerous dishonest individuals, even those not
closely associated with the New York Times, Chomsky defends Pol Pot as not
that bad and the news reports on Pol Pot as exaggerated.
Although the concept of modifying the limitation of a hangout is some piece
of linguistics.
I leave this for your to chew on, why is this Best person so protective of
the New York Times' reputation?
There is no easier way to tweak the nose of a commie by defending
conservatives (not fascists) they condemn so harshly, particularly since
conservatives make it so easy to be defended.

It's hard to say whether it should be surprising that Operation Northwoods
was committed to paper on government letterhead. An official government
document proposing terrorism against the American people. And throughout
history there were 53 admitted false flags:
 .
So it becomes fair to wonder what was so big about anthrax, and why Matt
deHart had to be arrested on trumped up charges.
On Page 88 of Part 10 of 59 on the FBI's released Amerithrax investigation,
a psychological profile without letterhead is provided. There are also
presumably letters from Ivins against fat people near the beginning of the
PDF file.
But if the CIA was responsible, would the FBI know, or would they have been
just doing their jobs? It's a pretty power argument for people just doing
their jobs when virtually every Nazi gave it as a reason. You'd have the
BAU giving facially a specific profile, but in reality about 1% or so would
qualify, so it'd fall under Schneier's arguments for no terrorist catching
system is effective (although clearly it won't be completely automated).
Then you'd have field agents under pressure to solve the case, they might
just be rationalizing why what their doing is correct.
For all it takes for Bruce Ivins to be falsely accused is for the CIA to
stay mum, and for the FBI to do their jobs?
In proportion to the punishment, murder convictions are inaccurate, one in
nine are exonerated based on retested DNA evidence. The CSI effect is quite
fortunate, or that rate would be higher, the police only gather enough
evidence to ensure a conviction, not to ensure they don't have an innocent
person. The probability that OJ was guilty was in all fairness, 40%.
Another 40% it was Jason. 20% it could've been anyone else. Legally, no
prosecution for murder should succeed by official standards.

The Linux kernel today faces an unprecedented safety crisis. Much like when
Ralph Nader famously told the American public that their cars were "unsafe

Linux Security Summit in Toronto that the operating system needs a total

No longer the niche concern of years past, Linux today underpins the server
farms that run the cloud, more than a billion Android phones, and not to
mention the coming tsunami of grossly insecure devices that will be hitched
to the Internet of Things. Today's world runs on Linux, and the security of
its kernel is a single point of failure that will affect the safety and
well-being of almost every human being on the planet in one way or another.
"Cars were designed to run but not to fail," Kees Cook, head of the Linux
Kernel Self Protection Project, and a Google employee working on the future

Connection number two is that Morris Ernst was J. Edgar Hoover's close

correspondence to him, so effectively Hoover had an informant within the
ACLU. There has been very little said on this topic.
Connection number three is that J.P. Barlow, founder of the EFF was
contacted by Robert Steele in 1992 (currently believes there is a child sex
slave colony on Mars) to speak at an intelligence conference.
  (but
it was pretty prescient "Nonetheless, I sallied forth, confidently telling
the gray throng that power lay not in concealing information but in
distributing it, that the Internet would endow small groups of zealots with
the capacity to wage credible assaults on nation-states, that young hackers
could easily run circles around old spies.")
Connection number four is that Morton Halperin negotiated with the CIA to

The Arms for Libya case ensued when a gang of CIA deep state operatives
were caught shipping a huge amount of weapons and explosives to Libya.
Edwin Wilson was hung out to dry by Ted Shackley and the rest of the cabal.
After a FOIA request revealed the CIA knew perfectly well what he was
doing, he was released after about 17 years in jail. He was never given
compensation and those responsible for the cover up were never brought to
Before his 1980 retirement, the CIA Inspector General John H. Waller
produced an internal investigation which exonerated Theodore Shackley and
his "career-long deputy and sidekick" Thomas Clines. This was the CIA's
official story for about 20 years, endorsed by Waller's successor, the man in the CIA, Charles A. Briggs who was called on to testify in Edwin
Wilson's court case. The CIA had blocked the defense from gaining access to
any contradictory paperwork, so the jury apparently believed the (perjured)
'Briggs Declaration' which said that Edwin Wilson has independently
collected almost the entire US stockpile of C-4 (plastic explosive) and
arranged to fly it to Libya, all without CIA knowledge, following up by
sending US troops to train of Muammar Gaddafi's military in bomb making,
and sold them a bunch of other weapons. This official narrative fell apart
about 20 years later when an internal document surfaced which proved that
the CIA Inspector Generals had been lying.
Frank Terpil was tried and found guilty in absentia. Douglas Schlachter
plead guilty to two charges in a plea deal, after providing testimony
directly linking Wilson to "senior Central Intelligence officials"
(presumably Ted Shackley and his sidekick Thomas Clines, who in 1981 both
admitted that they had kept in touch with Wilson, though they denied
knowing anything about the arms deals). Edwin Wilson was hung out to dry
and charged as the main culprit.
CIA officer, Edwin Wilson, brokered a number of weapons deals to Libya.
Michael Ruppert wrote that Wilson lived in Libya "for extended periods
between 1977 and 1981". The most extraordinary of these deals was in 1977,
when a 42,000 pound load of C-4 plastic explosive (an amount which
represented almost the entire US domestic supply) was flown out of Houston
International Airport to Muammar Gaddafi's Libya, followed by training in
bomb making by US Green Berets. Subsequent deals involved handguns and
other weapons. A scheme to ship more than a thousand M16 rifles to Gaddafi
put the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms onto Edwin Wilson back in
late 1977.
After about 17 years in jail, FOIA requests by Edwin Wilson came across
some internal paperwork which proved that those involved in the case knew
that the "Briggs Affidavit" was a lie. These sufficed to allow Wilson to
successfully appeal his conviction. In October 2003, his conviction on the
explosives charge was overturned and Wilson was released from prison on
September 14, 2004. He launched a legal claim for compensation against
those who perjured evidence against him, and those who knowingly stayed
silent on the matter, but they were granted legal immunity and he never
received compensation.

Pentagon militias in Syria (

Okay, I'll give you an answer: The CIA is set up so that it's impossible
for a person as an individual to arrogate to himself the right to lie to a
congressional committee or to anyone else. But what he can or cannot say is
clearly specified from the day he is sworn in. He can lie to people who are
not his bosses, who do not have security clearances. Most congressmen do
not have security clearances. When Senator Frank Church asked me something,
and he said, "Will you take an oath," I said, "Senator, I'll take the oath,
and I wouldn't think of telling you the truth." Personally, I like Colby
very much. He's a very fine man, but he's just the wrong kind of guy to be

For unknown reasons, this has been totally forgotten. Fortunately we rely
on Snowden to remember for us, and he says he revealed the truth for the

good with him?). But hey, I wrote something about the Pike Committee
vacuuming up information.

historical government lies to the public, that'd make your brain lame.

based on what little information is publicly available.
If you read Miles Copeland's interview, you can understand how Snowden the

Recently First Look has been reorganized a bit. Well, as a media
publication on the media says about it:
Topic.com is the product of First Look Media’s titular entertainment
studio, Topic, which officially went live earlier this year. Unlike the
nonprofit operations at First Look Media, like The Intercept, Topic and its
related operations are charged with building the company’s revenue
operations in part by financing and distributing independent projects such
as the documentary Nobody Speaks, which follows the Hulk Hogan trial that
helped take down Gawker. The documentary premiered on Netflix this month.
Topic itself is platform-agnostic: its productions will live on a variety
of platforms, including movie theater screens, podcast apps, television,
and, of course, Facebook and Twitter.
Looking at the staff of the for-profit First Look shows that it shares no
(or nearly no) staff with the non-profit first look.
Based on what I've read, I can guess that First Look and First Look are
unrelated organizations.

devices under the control of the public? Here's the blueprint.
Get a bunch of people together who are on the same page. Create for-profit
and non-profit corporations who aren't related. The designs and code must
be open-source to prevent co-option and unnecessary risk that corporation
could dominate and render the others irrelevant.
Pretty short blueprint huh? Wonder why no one hasn't come up with this
before... oh wait. Credit goes to Omidyar. The people in charge of your
freedom are not on your side. Only you can manufacture freedom.
P.S. /dev/random losing entropy when it is used only makes sense if the

Well, all my knowledge of hypnosis comes from an episode of Bull.
Repetition is a powerful thing, among other things it indicates success or
consensus if one approaches it from an evolutionary psychology perspective.
What I said a long time ago about how cryptography is incremental, that
easier to cryptanalyze provable ciphers would have less papers, and that
more complex ciphers would have more papers, it isn't an incredible
observation. But noting the observation would reduce the impact that the
deluge of papers on Simon and Speck would have (if it was simple to
cryptanalyze there'd be only two or three papers on each).
There was also a lot of repetition in the recent efforts to remove RC4 and
Triple DES. (nevermind the efforts to remove Saddam) RC4 in particular had
someone use it for a file encryption system for deniability?
Spotlight was a movie produced with assistance from First Look. There was a
scene that extremely disturbed me, more than all the child molestation.
Well, two scenes to be exact. The first scene was the new editor ordering
the journalists to investigate a case. The second scene was that the paper
did write about child molestation allegations in the past, but they put it
into the metro section. How easily are people manipulated? These
journalists went on to win prizes for their reporting, so clearly they are
not responsible for their own success. These are exceptional allegations,
the metro article was about a dozen alleged cases? Then it turned out to be
hundreds of children?
The part that really disturbed me is that no one reflected on this. This is
a thing that happened. The journalists unwittingly allowed it to occur.
Cardinal Law wittingly allowed it to occur.
The truth is out there. It is not hard to find.
Actually, all the journalists, with their intelligence contacts... they
have to be itching to ask one question. How could so many people in the
intelligence community be okay with the popular outrage from Snowden? How
do they rationalize it? Well. I don't know, but I think they are naive
enough to ignore past misdeeds, and they get told various things. Like how
it was Clapper's duty to lie to Congress (!) because no comment or this
should be in a closed hearing would be too suspicious. How could it be that
they think what they are doing is legal, but we think that hiding
information from the public is suspicious and sign of illegality? Maybe the
government does incidental collection with disk images and wiretaps on an
alarming scale. Maybe... maybe....
You are being manipulated. Only you can produce your freedom.

Gary Sick's is an interesting story. Sick is the author of October
Surprise, one of the best accounts of the covert deal struck in the Fall of
1980 between senior Republicans, arms merchants and Iranian mullahs to
delay the return of the American hostages until Ronald Reagan's
inauguration. But as interesting as it is, that's not the story I mean. I'm
talking about Sick's own story: his passage from career White House insider
to "conspiracy theorist."
My experience was not unlike that of a medieval scholar discovering traces
of a hidden text beneath the script of an old parchment.... I felt as if I
were wandering into a spy novel. The backgrounds and activies of some of
these individuals who were emerging from the shadows of this operation
seemed to come out of fiction, and yet they were real.... most of my
professional life had been spent as an analyst of political and military
intelligence. I knew that there were operatives for hire, ready to skirt
the law for money, perhaps out of habit or duty, or simply for the thrill
and sense of power illegal acts conveyed. But it was nonetheless a shock to
meet them....
Such characters are a researcher's nemesis; they are meant to be. When the
CIA or other intelligence agencies need to hire a "contractor," who may be
required to carry out taks that are potentially dangerous and of
questionable legality, they look for three things: a specific and useful
skill (a knowledge of money-laundering, perhaps); a romantic streak that
glorifies both the secrecy and the risk; and a propensity for exageration
and trouble. One former CIA officer, David MacMichael, has said that the
agency looks for these freelancers at small community airports and gun
ranges - places where men go to excape the boredom of everyday life.
Looking for adventure, these men are fascinated by the imagined glamour and
excitement of the world of espionage. MacMichael said that often, after one
or two assignments, the agency will put a contractor on a case in which he
runs afoul of the law. The contractor finds himself in a compromising
position - nothing so major as to put him permanently out of commission,
but significant enough that if he ever starts telling tales out of school
about covert operations, his record will discredit his testimony.
Take, for instance, the case of Delmart Vreeland. A scoundrel by every
account, but also one with exceptional information for those with ears to
hear. He did pass on the "Let one happen, stop the rest" warning from a
Toronto jail cell before 9/11; his claim that Canadian diplomat Marc
Bastien had been poisoned in Moscow has been proven correct; the Pentagon
unwittingly acknowledged his lengthy service record when it was called in
open court, by relying on archived records undamaged by the 9/11 attack
from which he had not been purged (the prosecution argued, incredibly, that
Vreeland must have hacked into the Pentgon files from his jail cell); Leo
Wanta, longtime intelligence asset who destabilized the Soviet ruble in the
'80s at the White House request, confirmed Vreeland was an operative of the
Office of Naval Intelligence; his lawyers did receive death threats and
found their files vandalized; and Vreeland has vanished.
But none of that matters to the coincidentalists, who stubbornly refuse to
see deeper than the "legends" created for men like Vreeland, which is
precisely the point. So Lee Harvey Oswald is a "communist," and Barry Seal
just a drug runner. That Oswald was seen with the CIA's David Atlee
Phillips in September 1963, and Barry Seal was gunned down with Vice
President George Bush's personal phone number in his trunk, need to be
ignored. The coincidentalists can't make sense of such evidence, that
respectable men would have anything to do with such characters. But without
them, some respectable men would be able to do very little.
Well, Vreeland had since the essay been written, convicted of soliciting
child prostitution in Franklin County, which is a bit messed up if you
heard the backstory of Franklin County.
The moment we live in a free society is probably when Kiriakou is working
at an Apple Store and is visited by the Attorney General and when Thomas
Drake has a fellowship with a major think tank, and it is when Delmart
Vreeland is a free man not on trumped up charges.
I think Marine One with Obama in it flew by my house once.

As of January 2017, WikiSpooks has withdrawn provision of an Anonymous file
upload upload facility.
Anonymous submissions are still welcome but, in view of low historical
usage of the secure upload-form facility, pgp-encrypted email (with or
without file attachments) is the only practical method available for the
site. Use of pgp-encryption with a single-use email address over a public
WiFi facility is probably as 'anonymous' as was the discontinued form.
Note: Unless anonymity is of fundamental importance, the best way to
publish a document file on Wikispooks is through the 'Regular file upload'

are immediately available to both view and edit on the WikiSpooks site.
Obviously if a news outlet is to publish a document, it should minimize any
information conveyed beyond the message. Actually US Gov FOI practices
typically involve printing out a redacted document before re-scanning it.
Ideally the best thing for the Intercept to have done is to use a low
resolution black-white copy machine, and mail the document again since
there is no urgency in this matter.
Naturally I am interested in when news organizations will publish

level that literally kept us up at night. For obvious reasons we couldn’t
publish what we found out but we took every opportunity to beg anyone who
could even tangentially influence the right people to do something about
this security problem. SemiAccurate explained the problem to literally
dozens of “right people” to seemingly no avail. We also strongly hinted
that it existed at every chance we had.
DMA access to the system. It can arbitrarily read and write to any memory
or storage on the system, can bypass disk encryption once it is unlocked
(and possibly if it has not, SemiAccurate hasn’t been able to 100% verify
this capability yet), read and write to the screen, and do all of this
completely unlogged. Due to the network access abilities, it can also send
whatever it finds out to wherever it wants, encrypted or not.
keep in mind, just how many computers run Intel. We don't backdoor
encryption. We backdoor everything.

Not shown by the mainstream media though.
Who decides for you what to think? Whoever it is, doesn't seem very
trustworthy right now.
Here's a simple law that congress could add that would decuple security:
"copyright is voided for software two years after the end of life, or if
after one year a critical vulnerability is unpatched"
Well, lawyers could go through it and convert it into legalcode for the
judicial architecture to parse.
Personally I am very much in favor of allowing free reverse engineering of
DOS and early Windows products.
Regardless, the most important use of non-government encryption is the
protection of trade secrets (hence the design of portable offline cipher
machines up to the late eighties). The rights of poor people never go into
the calculus of the powerful or the free market.
For some reason, this calculus currently seems to also exclude national
advantage. Everyone is hacking each other, but no one seems to really...

What would it take to convince you that your world view was entirely wrong?

Muckrock is clearly intimidated by John Young in this interview. They don't
seem to be asking many follow up questions, it appears as if it is half

Recently Cryptome has become a non profit.
Look at the Wau Holland Foundation.
John Young is one of the most powerful men alive.
Assange and anyone who genuinely supports him get crushed.
Recently the media has condemned Trump's condemnation of the Deep State,
but that hasn't occurred. What has occurred is several media personalities
and a member of the opposing party confirming a conspiracy theory to appeal
to the hopes of millions of overthrowing Trump. Strong responses to
imaginary events because it is media that controls reality, not you or I.
The ACLU protects the powerful by warping the definitions of power and
weakness, thereby allowing the powerful to crush the weak.
The obvious is right in front of you, if you dare look. If you dare listen.
If you simply dared to defy the interests of the powerful.
For the ACLU to think a certain kind of harassment is find is a pretty high
bar to meet. I mean afterall, they think you should be wiretapped by the
NSA, unless I have missed some repudiation of Jamal Jaffar's statements....
The ACLU is largely a criminal fraudulent organization, and the evidence is
quite strong to support it. Speak out of both sides of their mouths if you
The powerful have declared war on me, and I can, and will, single handedly

The simplest error correction code is a repetition code. This has escaped
many peoples attention.
" The frequency at which a key should be changed in order to maintain an
minimum level of protection depending on the number of unrolled rounds
computed per cycle is explored."
Here some attacks were made against Simon and Speck.
In my lay opinion, RC4 is more secure for the internet of things. The
greatest vulnerability for computers is memory bound errors, not... uh.
Malicious javascript sending a DDOS on an 100 megabit uplink to a server so
a passive adversary can collect ciphertexts and do statistical analysis.
Naturally everyone says that no one was fired for using AES, but who was
fired for not putting a password on a database?
I think if the RC4 round function was applied key length bytes more times
(128-bit key, 16 more key schedule rounds), the first few bytes will have
less bias, and the only related key recovery attacks apply to the first few
An additional xor to mask the output or input of a byte lookup may improve
Or use an ARX cipher as a NLFSR, like the Lex cipher.
In any case, don't use error correction codes in cryptography.
This is some kinda multidimensional chess.

Here,
Schneier commends the ACLU for improving civil liberties protections.
A John Conyers requested the DoJ view on the matter, to investigate it.
Governmentattic requested the documents in 2010, was released to them in
2012, and they finally posted it in 2014.
A large issue in our modern era is apparently how US laws are being
interpreted far outside what people expect.
The ACLU has done nothing in this matter. They are protecting civil
liberties through the most ineffective and indirect mechanisms imaginable,
anyone who spends millions of dollars per year with their lack of
accomplishments must be doing something wrong. The executive issues signing
statements saying that the judicial branch overrules Congress, whereas
Congress writes the laws. Congress will always overrule the Supreme Court
when it comes to reasonable interpretations of laws, it appears as if
Congress has to explicitly state it so, which Congress has not done.
I just thought everyone should be aware that the Holocaust was strictly
legal. So was the Soviet gulag. The law itself is not a prophylactic
against immorality.
Anyway, Seymour Hersh has done incredible reporting, he talks about it
He hears a rumor from one place, and then goes thoroughly investigates it.
(makes me wonder how anything was Top Secret with Bavarian fire drills)
Of course it doesn't seem like the ACLU ever asked him about any of it...
or famed Jason Leopold for that matter.
So what matters? Either federal intrusions are wholly legal, or they are
illegal. Somehow they have proven to be wholly legal over time, besides the
meek complaints by the ACLU that it's still illegal. Or maybe the NSA is
filled with thousands of men acting with impunity, who know what they are
doing is illegal. The most frightening possibility of all, no?
On a wholly different topic, I wonder why certain crimes are still possible
to commit through the internet. Congress can always mandate ID for some
services or cut funding for other services.

vulnerability for literally years now, it came up in research we were doing
on hardware backdoors over five years ago. What we found was scary on a
level that literally kept us up at night. For obvious reasons we couldn’t
publish what we found out but we took every opportunity to beg anyone who
could even tangentially influence the right people to do something about
this security problem. SemiAccurate explained the problem to literally
dozens of “right people” to seemingly no avail. We also strongly hinted
that it existed at every chance we had.
DMA access to the system. It can arbitrarily read and write to any memory
or storage on the system, can bypass disk encryption once it is unlocked
(and possibly if it has not, SemiAccurate hasn’t been able to 100% verify
this capability yet), read and write to the screen, and do all of this
completely unlogged. Due to the network access abilities, it can also send
whatever it finds out to wherever it wants, encrypted or not.
keep in mind, just how many computers run Intel. We don't backdoor
encryption. We backdoor everything.

I have previously told the Tor developers that they should work in PR, now
I believe that the NSA is also very good at PR. I shall decode Simon and
Speck: Block Ciphers for the Internet of Things for you.
" In a stable world, it’s a good strategy to specialize, but when
conditions change rapidly, specialists don’t always fare so well"
everyone uses AES. Or Keeloq. Or RC4. People select the protocol for the
application they will use, hence why the IoT won't use WPA2. Of course
digital signal processing requires many many gates so...
"For example, the consensus has long been that a budget of 2000 GE is all
the chip area that might reasonably be allocated for security on the most
constrained RFID tags"
Who sets the consensus? I believe Snowden and John Gilmore had something to
say about IPsec consensus?
Regardless, nearly 40% of the registers for 256-bit secure Simon is for the
temporary key. It isn't hard to beat Simon's security for better RFID
performance, but that would hurt it's performance on other applications.
Every cryptographer, particularly the ones who work on examining Keeloq
have totally failed to notice this.
"One further point about AES: not every application requires the same high
level of security that AES is designed to provide."
AES is the worst cipher to be adopted by American industry since DES.
Should've gone with Skipjack.
"that almost exactly matches PRINCE’s latency and area; it implements the
combinational logic for 5 rounds, and encrypts in b 44 / 5 c 9 cycles."
Yes, designing a hardware implementation with reasonable parameters will
reduce latency and area. Would you be surprised if Prince would be better
as a 2 cycle implementation?
"This is excellent performance relative to other block ciphers; indeed
CLEFIA realizes the 'world’s highest hardware gate e ciency'"
Other block ciphers may have been incompetently designed.
"The C implementations of Speck 128/256 have better overall performance
than the best C implementations of ChaCha20, a stream cipher especially
noted for its speed."
ChaCha is a 512-bit poorly keyed block cipher. To achieve diffusion over
such a large block size, more rounds and instructions are needed. To
achieve non-linear dependency on each key bit, more rounds are needed.
Naturally they said in a previous paper that ChaCha doesn't compare to
Speck because it is a stream cipher (weird meme). It is a sad comedy when a
protocol uses SHA-2-512 and truncates it to 256-bits to key a cipher when
to avoid slide and Meet in the Middle attacks one needs at least twice the
round keys.
Anyway, embedded micro controllers for storage devices are 100 MHz ARM CPUs
that cost half a cent each. There exists cheap FPGAs with a thousand slices.
"AES, on processors with cache memory can be particularly vulnerable to
these cache-timing attacks"
they just trolling you now and you don't see it
"Because of their simplicity (and perhaps because of their source!)"
The NSA is very sexy. Join us.
"Simon and Speck have been quite thoroughly vetted by the cryptographic
community in the two years since their publication."
Simon and Speck are very secure because numerous papers have incrementally
improved upon each other, fortunately there wasn't a major breakthrough
because that might halve the number of papers released. (oddly enough many
of the papers were from Chinese researchers)
The NSA manipulates you to your face, and you have failed. Each and every
one of you.
P.S. The phone system was a trade secret, but now WPA2 specification is a
paywall. All these bought off cryptographers are in a cover their ass
operation. They know they overlooked it, they have to explain to you why
they overlooked it so they can still appear valuable to you. We could've
had the Clipper chip, but now we may as well be using Tribler's OFB with
same IV (nothing to see here).
Anyway, WPA3 is needed for post-quantum eventually. Everything should head
towards some sort of post-quantum algorithm, now that NTRU's patent
expired. There is no reason why NTRU is not used, and I'd suggest
conservative parameters for a given amount of input entropy.
Smart cards and post-quantum for everything.
P.P.S. Binney is a pathological liar. Just watch A Good American on
Netflix. It is no wonder that the EFF is currently ineffectually
complaining about unconstitutional laws. John Schindler is right, he
doesn't express himself well, but I'm pretty sure he represents the
opinions of the intelligence community in that many of you are blind and
incompetent. (naturally the same could go for the intelligence community...)
Bonus round because a helicopter flew over my house:
Schneier said: "There is too much mistrust in the air. NIST risks
publishing an algorithm that no one will trust and no one (except those
forced) will use."
That means trust me, I am opposed to what is happening and I am an expert.
Schneier then said: I misspoke when I wrote that NIST made "internal
changes" to the algorithm. That was sloppy of me. The Keccak permutation
remains unchanged. What NIST proposed was reducing the hash function's
capacity in the name of performance. One of Keccak's nice features is that
it's highly tunable.
Oh, I was just exaggerating, trust me, I have gone over to the other's side.
When a familiar face changes their mind, will you go along with them if you
were wavering to begin with?

That means trust me, I am opposed to what is happening and I am an expert.
Schneier then said: I misspoke when I wrote that NIST made "internal
changes" to the algorithm. That was sloppy of me. The Keccak permutation
remains unchanged. What NIST proposed was reducing the hash function's
capacity in the name of performance. One of Keccak's nice features is that
it's highly tunable.
Oh, I was just exaggerating, trust me, I have gone over to the other's side.

the only thing that happened is that our phone companies are required to
store metadata instead the of the NSA (although I'm sure the NSA keeps a

1. Zero-day stockpiles. (cyber munitions shouldn't be used against enemies

2. Mass surveillance.
3. Public-private sector collusion.
The issues that GPL solves are:
1. I'm not contributing this code for free so others can profit off of it.

The issues that non-profits solves are:

the only thing that happened is that our phone companies are required to
store metadata instead the of the NSA (although I'm sure the NSA keeps a

I've been framed for heinous crimes, and denied any ability to disprove
them. For reasons not entirely clear to me, the ACLU and the EFF are okay
with me being harassed, and I believe my life has been ruined by the
government for over a decade, although it would be in the last half I

of times could be considered a misuse of government resources).
I cannot speak to the motivation of people I do not know why they would
frame someone developmentally delayed receiving special education support,
but I can say that anyone who investigated me and failed to realize that,
is themselves, severely retarded. In the era before scientific
investigation, people would have realized there is something wrong with
that picture, but people worship science now beyond all reason,
particularly if it means the advancement of their own profession. I met
with many psychologists and two psychiatrists under false pretenses, who
decided to put more weight in a diagnosis they wouldn't reveal to me, then
in what they could see before them.
Naturally four years ago, I figured anything this wide scale must involve
the deep state in some capacity, and there is nothing more deep state than
the backdoored nature of the entire architecture of the internet. I began
reading more about computers, and tried to get in with the cypherpunk

I've been framed for heinous crimes, and denied any ability to disprove
them. For reasons not entirely clear to me, the ACLU and the EFF are okay
with me being harassed, and I believe my life has been ruined by the
government for over a decade, although it would be in the last half I
considered it severe, as it began to include helicopters (which in the best
of times could be considered a misuse of government resources).
I cannot speak to the motivation of people I do not know why they would
frame someone developmentally delayed receiving special education support,
but I can say that anyone who investigated me and failed to realize that,
is themselves, severely retarded. In the era before scientific
investigation, people would have realized there is something wrong with
that picture, but people worship science now beyond all reason,
particularly if it means the advancement of their own profession. I met
with many psychologists and two psychiatrists under false pretenses, who
decided to put more weight in a diagnosis they wouldn't reveal to me, then
in what they could see before them.
Naturally four years ago, I figured anything this wide scale must involve
the deep state in some capacity, and there is nothing more deep state than
the backdoored nature of the entire architecture of the internet. I began
reading more about computers, and tried to get in with the cypherpunk
community. Unexpectantly, the cypherpunk community was aloof, and as I put
various insinuated accusations against me together, I discovered that the
cypherpunk community too was insinuated things in a casual indirect fashion.
I think there is nothing more deep state than Project Zero.
Have they asked for a list of opcodes that are speculatively executed from
Intel yet?
Will they ever investigate all the entries for Zerodium that cost $10,000?
The members of Project Zero are either idiots or shills. They are too smart
to be idiots, although there are smart idiots in the world.

@_subject: What everyone is saying about mobile OS security is wrong 
Google Play has given Google more control over security. Like Apple's App
Store, one central app distribution point gives Google more security
control. Google noted that Android devices that only download apps from
Google Play are nine times less likely to get a PHA than devices from other
sources. Google Play Protect protects almost two billion devices.
But is the above precisely correct?
While all Android devices benefit from protections built into the platform,
Android devices with Google Play services have an additional layer of
defense to keep them safe. Google protects these devices right out of the
box with Google Play Protect, our built-in device, data, and apps security
scanning technology.
No it is not, Google Play apps are scanned using a cloud anti-virus program.
What else is special about Google Play?
Manufacturers can be refused a licence if they do not meet Google's
requirements. Google does not charge for a GMS licence, but any company
producing an Android device will need a certificate from an authorised
testing facility in order to apply for the licence. That often incurs fees.
One source told the Guardian that the fee varies and is negotiated on a
case-by-case basis, with one example costing $40,000 for a batch of at
least 30,000 devices. A separate source said that in another deal, a
testing facility quoted $75,000 to test 100,000 devices.
And rather recently, Joseph Cox said in tweets within hours of each other
that the US government shutdown a phone maker that could only sell secure
Blackberries to drug dealers and that a judge signed a warrant for any
Google location enabled apps. For some reason, the Tor Project recieves
more free PR than any business providing a phone remotely resembling
anything that is desired by civil libertarians.
You people don't notice anything. At all. You people never accomplish
anything useful you want, ever.
It is extremely trivial for Google to make Android more secure, create an
app anti-virus API, require security updates within one month of the issue
being discovered for Google Play access, etc.
And the question about whether devices should be rooted or not by the user
is pretty simple. An unrooted device is a production environment designed
to be secure by hundreds of people, and the occasional bug bounty. A rooted
device is a development environment whose security is owed to anyone with
physical access to it.

While many x86 implementation vulnerabilities in the past involve either
electromagnetic emissions or cache timing attacks, I have not read anything
about instruction dispatch contention. According to anger fog’s research,
Intel’s implementation of the x86 instruction set does not dispatch more
than three of a single instruction, and it has been so for a long time.
Irregardless of their design decisions for instruction dispatch, this
provides a side channel in which two cooperating processes operating on the
same core can conduct half-duplex communication at the rate of 2 bits per
cycle by one process attempting to compete with another process for the
same capacity for dispatches over a single instruction (0, 1, 2, 3). While
I do not have the resources to know how x86 processors handles dispatch
contention issues, if it is handled in a regular and non-random manner, it
would reach that theoretical level of severity.
This violates certain access controls assumed to be imposed by the kernel.

assumptions and should be disabled by default. It is silly that OS updates
require reboots but spyware does not. It would be good interface design if
a computer crashed right after the moment of infection, it would even aid
the more tech savvy in debugging it.
Of course the sheer outrage from this is probably why the government will
never grant me a fair hearing to contest their claims against me.
I insist I was outrageously framed in order to authorize what has been a
decade long 'investigation' into me.

Making a Murderer has dramatic elements. When the defense attorney was

signed by Microsoft.
This should be the appropriate link: However when trying to archive the link, the link comes up as 404.
  I have a photograph of
the virustotal scan, while I believe I am pwned, the government is well
aware of the first amendment concerns of altering photographs in a person’s
possession as opposed to merely suppressing scans or whatever balancing
test they hide away from us. I could upload the screenshots, but I’m using
a different computer right now and I’m a bit on edge from all this.
It is not inconceivable that the FBI and virustotal are cooperating with
known file hashes and are suppressing them from public view, especially
given that virustotal gives access to uploaded files to major cyber
security and antivirus firms.
I would like to know the process in which these irregularities occur, and
whether or not there are consequences for misuse of valid activities for
corrupt ends and what checks are there on it.

In a very intriguing article entitled “The Nazi Religion: Views on
Religious Statism in Germany and America,” J.F.C. Moore argues
that Nazism and American conservatism are both deeply rooted
in the Illuminati conspiracy. According to Moore, (1) Nazism
emerged from the Thule Society, a right-wing occult lodge in
1920s Germany, which was influenced by the Illuminati, and (2)
Nazism has too many resemblances of right-wing movements in
America for the parallels to be coincidental.
Basically Moore’s theory holds that ever since the American
and French revolutions, certain rightist groups have seen anarchy
as the ultimate result of too much democracy and have tried to
prevent this by forming secret societies devoted to State-worship
and/or Christian Socialism, combined with a Gnostic mystique
of receiving guidance from heavenly or otherworldly beings. This
guidance produces the state called “Illumination” and causes the
initiate to feel a deep need to fight for Good and against Evil; the
problem is that Good and Evil are both defined in terms of the
ideology of Authoritarianism, with all rebels against “proper
authority” defined as devils incarnate. J. Edgar Hoover and
Congressman Otto Passman are named as members of such occult

"You fool yourself in the court," said the priest, "it talks about
this self-deceit in the opening paragraphs to the law. In front of the
law there is a doorkeeper. A man from the countryside comes up to the
door and asks for entry. But the doorkeeper says he can't let him in
to the law right now. The man thinks about this, and then he asks if
he'll be able to go in later on. 'That's possible,' says the
doorkeeper, 'but not now'. The gateway to the law is open as it always
is, and the doorkeeper has stepped to one side, so the man bends over
to try and see in. When the doorkeeper notices this he laughs and
says, 'If you're tempted give it a try, try and go in even though I
say you can't. Careful though: I'm powerful. And I'm only the lowliest
of all the doormen. But there's a doorkeeper for each of the rooms and
each of them is more powerful than the last. It's more than I can
stand just to look at the third one.' The man from the country had not
expected difficulties like this, the law was supposed to be accessible
for anyone at any time, he thinks, but now he looks more closely at
the doorkeeper in his fur coat, sees his big hooked nose, his long
thin tartar-beard, and he decides it's better to wait until he has
permission to enter. The doorkeeper gives him a stool and lets him sit
down to one side of the gate. He sits there for days and years. He
tries to be allowed in time and again and tires the doorkeeper with
his requests. The doorkeeper often questions him, asking about where
he's from and many other things, but these are disinterested questions
such as great men ask, and he always ends up by telling him he still
can't let him in. The man had come well equipped for his journey, and
uses everything, however valuable, to bribe the doorkeeper. He accepts
everything, but as he does so he says, 'I'll only accept this so that
you don't think there's anything you've failed to do'. Over many
years, the man watches the doorkeeper almost without a break. He
forgets about the other doormen, and begins to think this one is the
only thing stopping him from gaining access to the law. Over the first
few years he curses his unhappy condition out loud, but later, as he
becomes old, he just grumbles to himself. He becomes senile, and as he
has come to know even the fleas in the doorkeeper's fur collar over
the years that he has been studying him he even asks them to help him
and change the doorkeeper's mind. Finally his eyes grow dim, and he no
longer knows whether it's really getting darker or just his eyes that
are deceiving him. But he seems now to see an inextinguishable light
begin to shine from the darkness behind the door. He doesn't have long
to live now. Just before he dies, he brings together all his
experience from all this time into one question which he has still
never put to the doorkeeper. He beckons to him, as he's no longer able
to raise his stiff body. The doorkeeper has to bend over deeply as the
difference in their sizes has changed very much to the disadvantage of
the man. 'What is it you want to know now?' asks the doorkeeper,
'You're insatiable.' 'Everyone wants access to the law,' says the man,
'how come, over all these years, no- one but me has asked to be let
in?' The doorkeeper can see the man's come to his end, his hearing has
faded, and so, so that he can be heard, he shouts to him: 'Nobody else
could have got in this way, as this entrance was meant only for you.
Now I'll go and close it'."
They're only allowed to deal with that part of the trial which the law
allocates them, and they usually know less about the results of their
work after it's left them than the defence does, even though the
defence will usually stay in contact with the accused until the trial
is nearly at its end, so that the court officials can learn many
useful things from the defence.

The power of stingrays, and the lengths to which police will go to
conceal their use, are demonstrated by an ongoing case in Florida,
State v. Thomas. As revealed in a recent opinion of a Florida appeals
court, Tallahassee police used an unnamed device — almost certainly a
stingray — to track a stolen cell phone to a suspect’s apartment. (The
case’s association with stingrays was first pointed out by CNET’s
Declan McCullagh in January). They then knocked on the door, asked
permission to enter and, when the suspect’s girlfriend refused, forced
their way inside, conducted a search, and arrested the suspect in his
home. Police opted not to get warrants authorizing either their use of
the stingray or the apartment search. Incredibly, this was apparently
because they had signed a nondisclosure agreement with the company
that gave them the device. The police seem to have interpreted the
agreement to bar them even from revealing their use of stingrays to
judges, who we usually rely on to provide oversight of police

Contraband cellphones present an ongoing safety and correctional

negotiate a solution to problems that were threatening to break out
into war. The diplomats, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, John Marshall,
and Elbridge Gerry, were approached through informal channels by
agents of the French foreign minister, Talleyrand, who demanded bribes
and a loan before formal negotiations could begin. Although such
demands were not uncommon in mainland European diplomacy of the time,
the Americans were offended by them, and eventually left France
without ever engaging in formal negotiations.

In 1946, the series delivered a powerful blow against the Ku Klux
Klan's prospects in the northern US. The human rights activist Stetson
Kennedy infiltrated the KKK and other racist/terrorist groups.
Concerned that the organization had links to the government and police
forces, Kennedy decided to use his findings to strike at the Klan in a
different way. He contacted the Superman producers and proposed a
story where the superhero battles the Klan. Looking for new villains,
the producers eagerly agreed. To that end, he provided information—
including secret codewords and details of Klan rituals—to the writers.
The result was a series of episodes, “Clan of the Fiery Cross”, in
which Superman took on the Klan. Kennedy intended to strip away the
Klan's mystique. The trivialization of the Klan's rituals and
codewords had a negative impact on Klan recruiting and membership.

Marvin Washington Brooks had been terribly ill for nearly three
months. A year prior in early-1952, he had been diagnosed with cancer
and had been admitted as “a patient for treatment” to the University
of Texas Medical School’s M.D. Anderson Hospital. Brooks had served as
an infantryman in the Army during World War II. He had received a
Purple Heart for being wounded during the Battle of the Bulge. Not
long after he was admitted to the M.D. Anderson Hospital, Brooks began
to receive weekly treatment from a team of physicians led by an older
doctor with a heavy German accent and three distinctive scars across
his face. Brooks was told the treatment could significantly affect his
cancer in positive ways. But Brooks had become increasingly ill, with
constant vomiting, weight and hair loss, and patchy skin with large
areas appearing as if severely sunburned. Within about six months of
the weekly treatment, Brooks was in constant pain. He died the first
month of 1955, two days before what would have turned 47 years old.
Brooks was never informed that he was one of 263 cancer patients who
were secretly being experimented upon with “whole body irradiation.”
Brooks, nor his wife or family, had ever been consulted about the
experiments. Nor had Brooks, or anyone else, given the hospital
permission to experiment on him. Nobody ever told Brooks, or anyone in
his family, that the German physician who saw him weekly was Dr.
Herbert Bruno Gerstner, a former Nazi doctor who had been secretly
brought to the United States in 1949.
Dr. Orlando Daumy, a radiologist and president of the Cuban Cancer
Association, traveled to Puerto Rico to examine him. From his direct
physical examination of Albizu Campos, Dr. Daumy reached three
specific conclusions:
1) that the sores on Albizu Campos were produced by radiation burns
2) that his symptoms corresponded to those of a person who had
received intense radiation,
3) that wrapping himself in wet towels was the best way to diminish
the intensity of the rays.

In preparation for Ronald Reagan’s debate with President Jimmy Carter
in the presidential race 1980, Reagan’s campaign staff acquired under
mysterious circumstances a 200-page briefing book, including
information on Carter’s strategy, which staffers David Stockman and
David Gergen had used to prepare Reagan. The Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the Justice Department investigated to see how the
information had been obtained by the Reagan camp. Two law professors
filed suit in federal district court in Washington to request a
special investigation, based on the 1978 Ethics in Government Act.
Carter’s staff believed the book to have been stolen from the White
House, but the inquiry did not uncover any credible evidence that any
law had been violated. The House of Representatives conducted its own
investigation, and concluded in a 2,314-page report that the Reagan
staff had two copies of the book, one from Reagan’s campaign director
William J. Casey, future head of the Central Intelligence Agency.
James Baker attributed the acquisition of the documents to Casey, who
claimed to know nothing about them, and an analysis of Carter campaign
documents found in the “Afghanistan” files of Reagan aide David Gergen
indicated they came from three White House offices: the National
Security Council, Vice President Walter Mondale and Domestic Adviser
Stuart Eizenstat. Many years afterward, Carter himself stated in a PBS
interview that the book had been taken by columnist George Will, but
Will denied it, calling Carter "a recidivist liar."

THAT WHICH MAKES A KING LOSE THE KINGDOM THAT WAS INHERITED BY HIM
Tarquinius Superbus having killed Servius Tullus, and the latter not
leaving any heirs, he (Tarquinius) came to possess the kingdom with
security, not having to fear those things which had harmed his
predecessors. And although the manner of his occupying the kingdom was
irregular and odious, none the less had he observed the ancient
institutions of the other Kings, he would have been tolerated, and the
Senate and Plebs would never have arisen against him and taken the
State away from him. This man, therefore, was not driven out because
of his son Sextus having violated Lucretia, but for having broken the
laws and governed it (his Kingdom) tyrannically; having taken away all
authority from the Senate and assumed it himself, and those funds
which were marked for public improvements with which the Roman Senate
was satisfied, he diverted to the building of his own palace, with
disgust and envy for him resulting. So that in a very short time, he
despoiled Rome of all that liberty which she had maintained under the
other previous Kings. And it was not enough for him to make the
Fathers (Senators) his enemies, but he aroused the Plebs against
himself, working them hard in mechanical labor and all unlike those
which his predecessors had employed. So that by having filled Rome
with such cruel and haughty examples of his, he had already disposed
the minds of all the Romans to rebellion whenever they should have the
opportunity. And if the incident of Lucretia had not happened, even so
another would have arisen which would have produced the same result:
For if Tarquin had lived like the other Kings and his son Sextus had
not made that error, Brutus and Collatinus would have had recourse to
Tarquin for vengeance against Sextus, and to the Roman People.
Princes should understand, therefore, that they begin to lose the
State from that hour when they begin to break the laws and ancient
institutions under which men have lived for a long time. And if as
private citizens, having lost the State, they should ever become so
prudent to see with what facility Principalities are kept by those who
are counselled wisely, they would regret their loss much more, and
would condemn themselves to greater punishment than that to which
others have condemned them: For it is much more easy to be loved by
the good than the bad, and to obey the laws then to enforce them. And
in wanting to learn the course that they should have to hold to do
this, they do not have to endure any other hardship than to mirror for
themselves the lives of good Princes, such as Timoleon the Corinthian,
Aratus the Sicyonian, and similar ones, in the lives of whom they
would find as much security and satisfaction to him who ruled as to he
who is ruled; so that they ought to want to imitate him, being able to
do so for the reasons mentioned: For men when they are well governed,
do not seek or desire any other liberty; as happened to the people
governed by the above named (Princes), whom they constrained to be
Princes as long as they lived, even though they often had been tempted
to return to private life.
And as in this and the two preceding chapters, there has been
discussed the dispositions aroused against Princes, and of the
Conspiracy made by the sons of Brutus against their country, and of
those made against Tarquinius Priscus and Servius Tullus, it does not
appear to me to be something outside this subject to speak at length
of them in the following chapter, being a matter worthy of being noted
by Princes and Private Citizens.
OF CONSPIRACIES
And it does not appear proper to me to omit the discussion of
Conspiracies, being a matter of so much danger to Princes and Private
Citizens. For it is seen that many more Princes have lost their lives
and States through them, than by open war. For it is conceded only to
a few to be able to make open war against a Prince, but the ability to
conspire against them is conceded to everyone. On the other hand,
private citizens do not enter in an enterprise more perilous nor more
foolhardy than this, as it is difficult and most dangerous in all of
its parts. Whence it happens that many are attempted, and very few
have the desired ending. So that, therefore, Princes may learn to
guard themselves from these dangers, and that Private Citizens may
less rashly engage in them, and rather may learn to live contentedly
under the Rule that has been assigned to them by chance and by their
state, I shall speak widely, not omitting any notable case, in
documenting the one and the other. And truly that sentence of
Cornelius Tacitus is golden, which says that men have to honor things
past but obey the present, and ought to desire good Princes, but
tolerate the ones they have. And truly, whoever does otherwise, most
of the time will ruin himself and his country.
We ought, therefore, ((in entering on this matter)) to consider first
against whom conspiracies are made, and we will find them to be made
either against a country or against a Prince. It is of these two that
I want us to discuss at present; for those which are made to give a
town over to the enemy who besiege it, or that have some reason
similar to this, have been talked about above sufficiently. And in
this first part we shall treat of that against a Prince, and first we
will examine the reasons for it, which are many, but there is one
which is more important than all the others: and this is his being
hated by the general public; for in the case of that Prince who has
aroused this universal hatred, it is reasonable (to suppose) that
there are some particular individuals who have been injured by him
more (then others) and who desire to avenge themselves. This desire of
theirs is increased by that universal ill disposition that they see is
aroused against him. A Prince ought therefore to avoid these public
charges, but I do not want to talk here ((having treated of this
elsewhere)) of what he should do to avoid them. For by guarding
himself against this (hatred), the simple offenses against particular
individuals will make less war against him: One, because rarely is a
man met who thinks so much of an injury that he will put himself in so
much danger to avenge it: The other, even if they should be of a mind
and power to do so, they are held back by that universal benevolence
that they see the Prince to have. Injuries that happen to an
individual are of Possessions (taking them from him), of Blood
(physical injury), or of Honor. Of those of Blood, threats are most
dangerous, and there is no peril in the execution, because he who is
dead cannot think of vengeance, and those who remain alive most of the
time leave such thoughts to the dead: but he who is threatened, and
sees himself constrained by necessity either to act or to suffer,
becomes a most dangerous man for the Prince, as we shall relate in
detail in its place. Outside of this necessity, those (injuries) of
Possession and Honor, are matters that harm men more than any other
offense, and against which the Prince ought to guard himself, for he
can never despoil one so much that he does not leave a mind obstinate
to vengeance. And of (injuries) of honor, that are inflicted on men,
that against their women is most important, and after that, insult to
their person. This (kind of injury) armed Pausanias against Phillip of
Macedonia: this has armed many others against many other Princes: and
in our times, Julio Belanti would not have set in motion a conspiracy
against Pandolfo, Tyrant of Siena, except that the latter had given
him a daughter for his wife, and then took her away, as we will relate
in its place. The major cause that made the Pazzi conspire against the
Medici, was the inheritance of Giovanni Borromei, which was taken from
the former by the latter.

@_subject: The Fates of American Presidents Who Challenged the Deep State 
I believe that a significant shift in the relationship between public
and deep state power occurred in the 1960s and 1970s, culminating in
the Reagan Revolution of 1980. In this period five presidents sought
to curtail the powers of the deep state. And as we shall see, the
political careers of all five—Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford and
Carter—were cut off in ways that were unusual. One president, Kennedy,
was assassinated. Another, Nixon, was forced to resign.
To some extent the interplay of these two forms of power and political
organization is found in all societies. The two were defined by Hannah
Arendt in the 1960s as “persuasion through arguments” versus “coercion
by force.” Arendt, following Thucydides, traced these to the common
Greek way of handling domestic affairs, which was persuasion (πείθειν)
as well as the common way of handling foreign affairs, which was force
and violence (βία)." The two represent not just different techniques
of government but different cultures and mindsets, in fundamental
tension with each other.
This tension increases, and predictably tips toward violence, if a
well-organized open community expands beyond its own borders and is
increasingly occupied with the business of supervising an empire. It
is repeatedly the case that progressive societies (like America)
expand. As their influence expands, their democratic institutions,
based at bottom upon persuasive power among equals, are supplemented
by new, often secret, institutions of top-down violent power for the
control of alien populations abroad, often speaking different and
unfamiliar languages. The more the society expands, the more these
institutions of violent power encroach upon and supplant the original

Azolla has been deemed a "super-plant" as it can draw down as much as
a tonne of nitrogen per acre per year (0.25 kg/m2/yr); this is matched
by 6 tonnes per acre of carbon drawdown (1.5 kg/m2/yr). Its ability to
use atmospheric nitrogen for growth means that the main limit to its
growth is usually the availability of phosphorus: carbon, nitrogen and
sulphur being three of the key elements of proteins, and phosphorus
being required for DNA, RNA and in energy metabolism. The plant can
grow at great speed in favourable conditions – modest warmth and 20
hours of sunlight, both of which were in evidence at the poles during
the early Eocene – and can double its biomass over two to three days

Every society is run by an increasingly small number of cynical
decision-makers. Barring a change of circumstance where cynicism is
discouraged, their actions and plans are ultimately rewarded, and more
power is accrued to them. Success begets success.
Secrecy and immorality is incompatible with a free society, a free
press is necessary to provide the necessary information for which
society's members can decide the direction society may go. However if
the response to a given event is to claim that it isn't happening,
this constrains the freedom of action by which society's leaders can
devote resources to an issue.
Furthermore, it is the interests of cynical decision-makers in the
accrual of power to alter society so that various leaders are cowardly
and so unlikely to take an unprecedented action. Organizations that
operate in accordance to inertia can be easily predicted and
deviations from a course can be noticed and responded to accordingly.
This is paradoxically incompatible with long-term stability, the
people who desire access to the levers of power do not disappear, and
if they did, cynical decision-makers do not make up a majority of
society's members, they themselves are constrained from making public
decisions or actions that would in it self be threatening and lead to
a reaction by society's leaders to effect their removal out of a
desire for self-preservation (unless it was sufficiently clear that
ambition was not synonymous with hazard).
Thus even the response to threats to a political order is constrained
by perceptions, and this in turn constrains the allocation of
resources to respond. The press, if dedicated to preserving the
current political order, cannot describe a threat to the political
order in terms that would allow for the threat to expand in support
beyond society itself is willing to provide in responding to it.

CELINE'S LAWS
                      by  Hagbard Celine
   As  every thinking person has noticed, our national  life  has
become increasingly weird and surrealistic.  The waiting lines at
banks  and  post offices are growing longer all  the  time,  even
though  demographers tell us US population is no  longer  rising.
The  street  signs more often than not say WALK on  the  red  and
DON"T  WALK  on  the  green.  You can't  get  a  plumber  on  the
weekends.  Nobody has been able to explain the cattle mutilations
yet.   Every survey shows that the price of consumer  goods,  the
number  of violent crimes, and the eerie popularity of  THE  GONG
SHOW are ominously accelerating.
   I  believe  I  have found the  explanation  these  distressing
trends.   Needless to say, I cannot present, in a short  article,
all  the  evidence which I have accumulated in three  decades  of
careful  metasociological research; that will have to  await  the
publication  of  my three-volume study, "Why Everybody  Is  Going
Bonkers."   Here  I  can  only mention  the  thousands  of  depth
interviewws,   the   innumerable  flowcharts   and   helix-matrix
equations,  the  vast  files of computer readouts,  the  I  CHING
divinations,  and  other rigorous scientific techniques  used  in
developing  what I modestly call Celine's Laws of Chaos,  Discord
and Confusion.
   Celine's  First  Law is that National Security  is  the  chief
cause of national insecurity!
That may sound like a paradox, but I will explain it at one.
   Every secret police agency must be monitored by an elite corps
of secret-police-of-the-second-order.  There are numerous reasons
for this, but three are especially noteworthy.
NATIONAL SECURITY IS THE CHIEF CAUSE OF NATIONAL INSECURITY!!!
1).  Infiltration  of  the  secret police,  for  the  purpose  of
subversion,   will   always   be  a  prime   goal   of   internal
revolutionaries.  This is an ordinary part of the  spy-counterspy
game.   There  is nothing Weather Underground would  like  better
than having a few agents in the FBI or CIA, for the same  reasons
that  the FBI or CIA would like to have a few agents  in  Weather
2).   Such  infiltration  will also be a prime  goal  of  hostile
foreign powers, for the same reasons.
   Please  note that these are simple facts of the  secret-police
game, well-known even to the general public, the subject of  many
ingenious  plots  in  popular spy  films,  and  not  particularly
alarming...yet.    Nonetheless,  the  seeds  of  Chaos,  Discord,
Confusion,  and Paranoia are already here, for the simple  reason
that  once  a  human  being develops  the  habits  of  worry  and
suspicion,  he  or she finds increasing justifications  for  more
worry and more suspicion.  For instance, Richard Q. (not his real
initial),  one of my interview subjects, became concerned,  after
ten  years  in the CIA, with the possibility of  infiltration  by
"extraterrestrial"  agents.   He was eventually retired  when  he
began  to  claim that demons in the form of dogs  wanted  him  to
assassinate Laverne and Shirley.
3).   Secret-police  officials acquire  fantastic  capacities  to
blackmail and intimidate others in goverment.
   Stalin  executed three chiefs of his secret police in  a  row,
because  of this danger.  One of my informants claims that  every
president since the National Security Act was passed in 1947  has
learned  how to have sexual intercourse without making  a  single
audible sound, because of the possible electronic  eavesdroppers.
As Nixion says so wistfully on the Watergate transcripts,  "Well,
Hoover performed.  He would have fought.  That was the point.  He
would  have  defied a few people.  He would have scared  them  to
death.   HE HAS A FILE ON EVERYBODY!" .  Thus,  those
who  employ secret-police organizations MUST monitor them  th  be
sure they are not acquiring too much power.
   In  the United States today, the superelite that monitors  the
CIA  is the National Security Agency. ( And a group  called  "The
Store" monitors the NSA).
   Here  is  where a sinister infinite regress enters  the  game.
Any  such elite, second or third order secret-police agency  must
be, according to the above pragmatic and necessary rules, subject
to infiltration by native subversives or hostile foreign  powers,
or  to acquiring "too much power" in the opinion of its  masters.
(It  may  even  be  subject, if Richard Q.  was  correct  in  his
anxieties,  to extraterrestrial manipulation).  And so, it,  too,
must be monitored by a secret police of the third order.
    But this third-order secret-police (such as Nixon's notorious
"plumbers",  or more currently, "The Store"). is also subject  to
infiltration  or  to acquiring too much  power...and  thus,  with
relentless logic, the infinite regress builds.  Once a  goverment
has  n  orders  of secret police spying on each  other,  all  are
potentially suspect, and to be safe a secret police of order  n+1
must be created.  And so on, forever.
* THUS WHO EMPLOY SECRET                 *
* POLICE MUST MONITOR THEM TO            *
* BE SURE THEY ARE NOT ACQUIRING         *
* TOO MUCH POWER.                        *
   In  practice,  of  course,  this  cannot  really  regress   to
infinity,  but  only to the point where every other  citizen,  or
until the funding runs out, whichever comes first.
   National Security in practice, then, must always fall short of
the  logically  ideal  infinite regress which we  have  shown  is
necessary  to the achievement of its goal.  In that  gap  between
the  ideal  of "One nation under survillance, with  wiretaps  and
mail  covers for all" andthe strictly limited real  situation  of
finite funding, there is ample encouragement for paranoias of all
sorts  to  flourish.   In short, every  government  that  employs
secret-police agencies must grow more insecure, not more  secure,
as  the  strength, versatility, and power  of  the  secret-police
agencies grow.
   For  instance, a certain left-wing nation which  has  employed
secret-police  agencies  for 61 years has now reached  the  point
where  the  leaders  are terrified of  painters  and  poets.   In
another, right-wing nation infested with secret-police  agencies,
several  purges  have been caused by three practical  jokers  who
regularly  call  middle-rank officials on the phone and  talk  in
what appears to be a code.  The secret police, of course, are  no
fools,  and  are aware that this might be what it in fact  is,  a
form of anarchist humor; but they can't be sure.
   What  usually  happens  in such cases  is  this:  an  official
receives  one  of these mystery calls, saying  perhaps  "Pawn  to
queen rook five. No wife, no horse, no mustache.  A boy has never
wept  nor  dashed  a thousand kim."  He  knows  immediately  that
surveillance upon him will be increased tenfold.  In the next few
days,   while  memories  of  all  his  mistakes,  small   bribes,
incautious  remarks,  and other incriminating  events  haunt  his
imagination,  he observes the increased surveillance, and  begins
to  suspect even the most loyal of his subordinates  of  watching
him  with  eyes  that  miss  nothing  and  to  give  a   sinister
interpertation  to  everything.   Within  ten  days,  he  usually
attempts  to  contact  a  foreign  goverment  to  seek  political
sanctuary, and the secret-police net closes on him.
   By  the  same  process  of worry leading  to  more  worry  and
suspicion  leading to more suspicion, the very act of  joining  a
ecret-police  organization will eventually turn a man  or  woman
into a clinical paranoi; in layman's terms, "bananas" or  "wigged
out."   THE AGENT KNOWS WHOM HE IS SPYING ON; BUT HE NEVER  KNOWS
WHO IS SPYING ON HIM!  Could it be his wife, his girl friend, his
secretary, the newsboy, the Good Humor man?
   For these reasons, secret-police agents develop elaborate  and
complex  theories  to  account for what  is  actually  going  on.
According  to  one  of my tables of data, there  isn't  a  single
theory  held  by professional conspiracy buffs which  isn't  also
believed  by many members of our various secret-police  agencies.
In  fact, the exact percentages of believes in these  extravagant
scenarios are quite similar among a group of 1,000 CIA agents and
a  control  group of 1,000 readers of the underground  press,  as
shown in table 1.

   Now, Table 1 clearly gives a picture of a rather  schizzed-out
nation.   This is the result of the impossible  infinite  regress
and its resultant of worry leading to more worry.
   Furthermore, if there is a secret police at all, in any nation
you  care  to  imagine,  every  branch  and  department  of  that
country's government becomes suspect, in the eyes of cautious and
intelligent people, as a possible  front or funnel to the  secret
police.   (That is, the more shrewd citizens will recognize  that
something  titled a branch of the HEW or even PTA might  actually
be  run by the CIA).  Inevitably, the government as a whole,  and
many  nongovernmental  agencies, will be regarded  by  reasonable
persons  with fear and trepidation.  Proverbs like "One can't  be
too  careful  these days" and "Better safe than sorry"  become  a
kind of sinister folk wisdom.
   But  further  yet: any government which already has  a  secret
police  (and a secret police monitoring the secret police,  etc).
will   become  alarmed  on  observing  that  its  more  hip   and
intelligent citizens now regard it with loathing and  misgivings.
The government will therefore increase the size and powers of the
secret  police.   This  is the only  rational  move,  within  the
context of the secret-police game.
* SOMETHING PASSING AS A     *
* BRANCH OF HEW MIGHT BE A   *
* FRONT FOR THE CIA!         *
   (The  only  alternative was once  suggested  sarcastically  by
playwright  Bert  Brecht, who said, "If  the  government  doesn't
trust  the  people, why does'nt it dissovle them  and  elect  new
people?"  No way has yet been invented to elect a new people;  so
the  police  state will instead spy on the existing  people  even
more vigorously).
   This,  of  course,  creates additional paranoia  in  both  the
governors  and  the citizens, because  a  suffciently  pugnacious
secret  police  will  eventually  "have  a  file  on  everybody,"
including  its  own  creators.  This leads  to  another  infinite
regress:  the  more people will loathe the government,  the  more
power will be given to the secret police.
   Thus,  whether any of the hypothetical conspiracies  mentioned
earlier  really exist or not, a system of  clandestine  goverment
inevitably produces, in both the rulers and the ruled, a mood  of
paranoia in which such conspiracy theories flourish.
   This escalating sense of suspiciousness is accelerated by  the
fact  that every secret-police organization engages in  both  the
collection  of  information and  the  production  misinformation.
That  is,  you  score points in the secret-police  game  both  by
hoarding  signals (information units)---that is, by hiding  facts
from  competitive players---and by foisting false  signals  (fake
information  units)  on  the other  players.   This  creates  the
situation which I call Optimum Fuckup, in which every participant
has  rational  (not neurotic) cause to suspect that  every  other
player may be attempting to deceive him, gull him, con him,  dupe
him, and generally misinform him.  As Henry Kissinger is  rumored
to  have  said,  "Anybody  in Washington  these  days  who  isn't
paranoid is crazy!"
   One  could generalize the remark: anyone in the United  States
today who isn't paranoid must be crazy!!!
* "IF THE GOVERMENT DOESN'T      *
* TRUST THE PEOPLE, WHY DOESN'T  *
* IT DISSOLVE THEM AND ELECT A   *
* NEW PEOPLE?"                   *
   The   deliberate   production  of   misinformation   (or,   as
intelligence    agencies    more   euphemistically    call    it,
disinformation)  creates a situation profoundly  disorienting  to
the philosopher, the scientist, and the ordinary Joe who wants to
know  the  best time to go to the bank.  The desire  to  discover
"what-the-hell-is-really-going-on"  (the  definition  of  science
offered  by  physicist Saul-Paul Sirag) is  totally  incompatible
with  the circulation of disinformation; we all need to know,  at
least roughly, what the hell is really going on if we are not  to
stumble around like blind robots colliding with things we weren't
told were there.
   Maybe  the  UFO's  really  exist---or  maybe  the  whole   UFO
phenomenon is a cover for an intelligence operation.  Maybe there
are  black  holes  where space and time  implode---or  maybe  the
entire  black-hole cosmology was created to befuddle and  mislead
Russian scientists.  Maybe Jimmy Carter really exists---or  maybe
he  is,  as the National Lampoon claims, an  actor  named  Sidney
Goldfarb specially trained to project the down-home virtues  that
the  American people nostalgically seek.  Perhaps only three  men
at  the  top  of the National Security Angency  REALLY  know  the
answers  to  these questions---or perhaps those three  are  being
deceived by certain subordinates (as Lyndon Johnson was  deceived
by  the CIA about Vietnam) and are as disoriented as the rest  of
us. Such is the logic of a Disinformation Matrix.
   Personally, I find it easier to believe in UFO's than in black
holes  or Jimmy Carter; but that may just indicate the damage  to
my  own brain caused by the Optimum Fuckup of the  Disinformation
   According  to  a recent survey 19 per cent of  the  population
believe  the  moon landings were faked by Stanley Kubrick  and  a
gang of special effects experts.  Perhaps these archskeptics  are
the  sanest  ones left among us.  Who among the readers  of  this
file  has a security clearance high enough to be ABSOLUTELY  sure
that these ultraparanoids are wrong?
   This  general  tendency toward chaos discord,  and  confusion,
once  a  secret police has been established, is  complicated  and
accelerated   by   Celine's  Second  Law,   to   wit:   "Accurate
communication  is  only possible in  a  nonpunishing  situation."
This is a very simple statement of the obvious, and means no more
than  that  everybody  tends to lie a little, to  flatter  or  to
protect  themselves, when dealing with those who have power  over
them, especially the power to punish.  (this is why communication
between parents and children is notoriously befoolzled).
   Every authoritarian structure can be visualized as a  pyramid,
with  very few at the top and very many at the bottom, as in  the
flowchart  of  any  corperation or bureaucracy.   On  each  rung,
participants  bear  a burden of nescience in  relation  to  those
above them.  That is, they must be very, very careful that  their
natural  sensory activities as conscious organisms---the acts  of
seeing,  hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling, drawing  inferences
from  perception,  etc.---be in accord with the wishes  of  those
above  them.  This is absolutely vital; job security  depends  on
it.   It  is much less important---a luxury that  can  easily  be
discarded---that  these  perceptions  be in  accord  with  actual
* COMMUNICATION IS ONLY *
* BETWEEN EQUALS.       *
   For instance, in the FBI under J. Edgar Hoover, the agent  had
to  develop  the capacity to see godless  communists  everywhere.
Any  agent whose perceptions indicated that there  were  actually
very  few  godless  communists  anywhere  in  this  country  wold
experience  what psychologists call cognitive dissonance: his  or
her  reality grid was at variance with the official reality  grid
of  the  pyramidal  authority  structure.   To  talk  about  such
divergent  perceptions  at all would be to invite  suspicions  of
eccentricity, of intellectual wiseacreing, or of being oneself  a
godless  communist.   The  same  would  apply  to  any  Dominican
Inquisitor  of earlier centuries who lacked the capacity  to  see
witches  everywhere.   In such authoritarian  situations,  it  is
important  to see what the authorities see; it  is  inconvenient,
and possibly dangerous, to see what is actually there.
   But this leads to an equal and opposite burden of  omniscience
on  those  at the top, in the Eye of the  authoritarian  pyramid.
All  that  is forbidden to those at  the  bottom---the  conscious
activities  of perception andand evaluation---is demanded of  the
master classes, the elite and the super-elite.  They must attempt
to do the seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling,  thinking,
and decisionmaking for the whole society.
   But  a man with a gun (the power to punish) is told only  what
his  target thinks will not cause him to pull the  trigger.   The
elite,  with  their burden of omniscience, face  the  underlings,
with  their  burden  nescience, and  receive  only  the  feedback
consistent  with their own preconceived notions.  The  burden  of
omniscience becomes, in short, another and more complex burden of
nescience.  Nobody really knows anything anymore, or if they  do,
they are careful to hide the fact.
   As  the national security paradigm approaches (or attempts  to
approach)  the ideal infinite regress  of  spies-spying-on-spies-
spying-on-spies,  etc., the resultant general trepidation  causes
all  persons to hide anything they know (if it differs  from  the
official reality), not only from their superiors, but from  peers
and inferiors as well.  Anybody, after all, might be part of  the
nth-degree secret police.  "One can't be too careful these days."
The  burden of nescience becomes omnipresent.  More and  more  of
reality becomes unspeakable.
   But  as  Freud  noted, that  which  is  objectively  repressed
(unspeakable) soon becomes subjectively repressed  (unthinkable).
Nobody likes to feel like a coward and a liar constantly.  It  is
easier to cease to notice where the official reality grid differs
from  sensed experience.  Thus Optimun Fuckup  gradually  becomes
Terminal  Fuckup, and rigiditus bureaucraticus  sets in; this  is
the last stage before all brain activity ceases, and the  society
is intellectually dead.
   Celine's Third Law is like unto the first two, and holds  that
AN HONEST politician is a national calamity.
   At  first  glance,  this seems preposterous.   People  of  all
shades  of opinion agree that at least on the axiom that we  need
more honest politicians, not more crooked ones.  Please remember,
however,  that people of all shades of opinion once  agreed  that
the Earth is flat.
   Your  typical dishonest politician (bocca grande normalis)  is
interested  only  in enriching himself at the public  expense,  a
goal  he  shares  with most of his  fellow  citizens,  especially
doctors  and  lawyers.  This is normal behavior for  our  primate
species,  and society has always been able to endure and  survive
* NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING, OR IF *
* THEY DO, THEY ARE CAREFUL TO *
* HIDE THE FACT!               *
   An  honest  politician (bocca grande giganticus) is  far  more
dangerous.  He or she is sincerley commited to bettering  society
by  political  action.  In practice, that means  by  writing  and
enacting  more laws.  Indeed, many groups of idealistic  citizens
publish  rating sheets on politicians every year, and  those  who
have created more laws are estimated as having higher value  than
those  who are frequently absent when bills are voted upon.   The
assumption  is  that  adding  more laws to  statute  books  is  a
positive achievement, like adding more money to our paychecks  or
more art works to a museum.
   A  little thought, however, shows that this assumption is  not
tenable.   Every  law  creates a whole new  criminal  class;  for
instance, when marijuana was illegalized in 1937, several hundred
thousand   formerly   law-abiding   citizens   became   criminals
overnight, by Act of Congress.  As more and more laws are passed,
more and more citizens become criminals.  The chief cause of  the
rising crime rate is the rising number of laws being enacted.  An
honest   politician,  who keeps his nose to  the  grindstone  and
enacts several hundred laws in the course of his career, thereby
produces as many as several million new criminals.
   It  is furthermore mathematically demonstrable that  the  more
laws there are, the more restrictions there are on the freedom of
the  individual.  If there were, say, only three laws in a  given
society---e.g.,  Thou shalt not kill; thau shalt not steal;  thou
shalt not lie or defraud---there would be only three restrictions
on freedom, which all rational persons would accept as  obviously
necessary  to the maintenance of order.  When there  are  several
hundred thousand restrictions on freedom, most of which are  felt
as extremely irksome by large segments of the populace.
   In  fact,  it would take a brigade of lawyers  several  weeks,
minutely  examining  your  affairs, to determine  if  you  are  a
criminal.   Certainly,  no  ordinary  citizen  has  the  time  or
research facilities to discover if he or sshe is in violation  of
one out of skillions of laws currently on our statute books.   In
many  cases,  two  lawyers  consulted  independently  will   give
opposite  opinions about whether or not a given course of  action
is in violation of the statutes.
   And  new  laws  are being enacted all  the  time.   Obviously,
unless  there is a sudden paper shortage, the number of  laws  on
the books will eventually reach the point satirized by T.H.White,
in  which  "everything not prohibited is compulsory."   It  would
then  probably only take a few years or decades more for a  cadre
of honest politicians diligently writing even more laws to  reach
the  complementary  point  where "everything  not  compulsory  is
* EVERY LAW CREATES A WHOLE     *
* NEW CRIMINAL CLASS OVERNIGHT! *
   At  that  stage the nightmare world of Orwell's 1984  will  be
achieved.   Crooked politicians, merely interested in the  normal
human  activity of making themselves rich and comfortable,  could
never  create  that ultimate horror; but  honest  and  idealistic
politicians  bring us closer to it every day, with every new  law
they enact.
   These three generalizations---that national security  produces
national     insecurity;    that    authoritarianism     produces
miscommunication and eventual idiocy; and that honest politicians
are  a plague upon society---will be found to fully  explain  the
Decline  and  Fall of Rome, the Decline and Fall of  the  British
Empire, and the Decline and Fall of any country you care to name.

The Wuhan Flu can't be a bioweapon, it would be too absurd and stupid
for anyone to weaponize a contagious disease when warfare itself is a
dissolution of borders where nothing can be contained and everyone can
potentially be impacted equally.
As a private citizen, I think it absurd that Wuhan, the provincial
capital of Hubei, can't be mentioned when their own fellow Chinese in
Jiangxi distrust the Hubei police in regulating the flow of people
between provinces. To quote Thomas Jefferson: "To give praise which is
not due might be well from the venal, but would ill beseem those who
are asserting the rights of human nature."
I do not think that leadership involves much ability, it is mostly
cutting checks and telling people to do the obvious. I do believe in
free speech, wherever, including in the bedrooms, but ill-mannered
statements on certain topics should be a disqualifier for being in
certain positions of trust, or at least require checks against
potentially harmful decisions. It is unclear why genuine and valid
criticisms of authority has become so scarce.
I seriously hate you all, but not in that way, and hope everyone can
