@_subject: Should openssl accept weak DSA/DH keys with g = +/- 1 ? 
I am a noob at crypto.
IIRC similar attack was used against Tor
several years ago.
In DSA it is possible to force g=1 or g \equiv -1 \mod p.
The first is unit and the second is of multiplicative
order 2.
This are clearly weak and insane choices,
but this might have implications to MITM
(might be wrong on this).
For DH could generate key with g=1, though
couldn't test it.
Tested both 1 and -1 cases in DSA,
the probability of successful connection
was about 1/4 (or maybe 1/2), errors in the
other cases. (for $1$ I would expect probability
Attached are cacert.pem and cacert2.pem,
the magic word is 1234.
To test:
$ openssl s_server -accept 8888 -www -cert cacert.pem
$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:8888 -showcerts
To examine
$openssl x509 -text -in cacert2.pem
$openssl dhparam -text -in dHParam.pem
(not sure if dHParam.pem this is usable, forged generation).
Firefox refuses connections, Konqueror works
with same probability.
Suspect this might be related to EC refusing
the point at infinity.
Might have MITM implications, don't have
working exploit (If a MITM can forge $g=1$ in DH,
the private keys are useless).

Sorry, but I don't believe this.
I agree with juan that tor has many bugs and quite likely is
 _heavily_ backdoored, the bugs we see are probably just the top of
the iceberg.
I suppose sufficiently many people got busted because of trusting tor
The usa profits more from sniffing tor traffic than your alleged

Also some of the Snowden docs suggest "NSA can monitor tor, but
don't want to scare _all_ tor users" (almost literally quoted).

Currently in theory most people have right of

exceptions they rule and one can hardly exercise free speech without hitting limit/exception.

Agree with the main idea, but not sure agree
with the "limits".
Currently in theory most people have right of
free speech, but there are so many limits/
exceptions they rule and one can hardly exercise free speech without hitting limit/exception.
To paraphrase a quote:
First they came for the terrorists,
and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a terrorist,
Then they came for the communists,
and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a communist,
...{jews, trade unionists, protestants}
Then they came for me,
and by that time no one was left to speak up.

DISCLAIMER: I am noob at electronics, this is crazy or
at best a fishing expedition...
Let $f$ be some hash function, say md5. Restrict the size of input
to be equal to the output (128 bits for md5).
Cryptographer told be it is open problem if there is
solution to $f(x)=x$ (treated as sequence of bits).
Implement $f$ as pure combinatorial circuit (NO CLOCK),
with 128 $i_k$ inputs and 128 outputs $o_k$.
For all $j$, connect $i_j$ with $o_j$ so the circuit
doesn't have neither inputs nor inputs (basically
loop the circuit $f$).
Power on.
Measure (possibly with oscilloscope) $i_j=o_j$.
If you are lucky to hit stable state, you have solved
In an unstable stable (no solution), maybe one will measure very
high frequency.
Probably this is well studied, though an
engineer couldn't find reference for the general case.
1. Are there references for this?
2. If it fails why will it fail?
3. If a solution exists is it known for how long it
will be found?
4. If the question is not entirely insane, is there better
Partial experimental results:
It wasn't easy, but me convinced an engineer to test it
on bare metal.
Take $n$ inverters (logical negation) and loop them
in a cycle (basically this corresponds to the cycle
graph $C_n$).
There are no input and no outputs.
For even $n$ the circuit has exactly 2 stable
For odd $n$, there is no stable state since
the boolean formula is unsatisfiable.
The engineer worked with NAND gates on a stand.
Experimentally, for $n=4$, the engineer reached
stable state.  Depending on which NAND gates he chose,
the stable state differed.
For $n=3$ there was no stable state.
The voltage was in the middle between logical 0-1,
possibly with high frequency which his oscilloscope
couldn't measure.
The engineer told me these circuits don't make
sense in electronics. (So what?).
I wouldn't trust a software simulation for this,
might be wrong.
The experiments were too simple, so it is
possible electric current to solve easy problems
and not solve hard problems.

Partial experimental results:
It wasn't easy, but me convinced an engineer to test it
on bare metal.
Take $n$ inverters (logical negation) and loop them
in a cycle (basically this corresponds to the cycle
graph $C_n$).
There are no input and no outputs.
For even $n$ the circuit has exactly 2 stable
For odd $n$, there is no stable state since
the boolean formula is unsatisfiable.
The engineer worked with NAND gates on a stand.
Experimentally, for $n=4$, the engineer reached
stable state.  Depending on which NAND gates he chose,
the stable state differed.
For $n=3$ there was no stable state.
The voltage was in the middle between logical 0-1,
possibly with high frequency which his oscilloscope
couldn't measure.
The engineer told me these circuits don't make
sense in electronics. (So what?).
I wouldn't trust a software simulation for this,
might be wrong.
The experiments were too simple, so it is
possible electric current to solve easy problems
and not solve hard problems.

to be equal to the output (128 bits for md5).

solution to $f(x)=x$ (treated as sequence of bits).
Implement $f$ as pure combinatorial circuit (NO CLOCK),

Wouldn't argue about the title, but something like "Division by zero"
would be better. IIRC there is a novel with this exact name (I recommend it). By Ted Chiang.

This is old, but I don't do windows.
In addition the screenshot of the phone appears not
privacy friendly to me.
Those friends include their Outlook.com (nee Hotmail) contacts, Skype
contacts and, with an opt-in, their Facebook friends.
If you wander close to a wireless network, and your friend knows the
password, and you both have Wi-Fi Sense, you can log into that network.
Wi-Fi Sense doesn’t reveal the plaintext password to your family,
friends, acquaintances, and the chap at the takeaway who's an
Outlook.com contact, but it does allow them, if they are also running
Wi-Fi Sense, to log in to your Wi-Fi. The password must be stored
centrally by Microsoft, and is copied to a device for it to work;
Microsoft just tries to stop you looking at it. How successful that will
be isn't yet known.
The feature has been on Windows Phones since version 8.1. If you type
the password into your Lumia, you won’t then need to type it into your
laptop, because you are a friend of yourself.

Your model is very good on paper.
I am _very sceptical_ about _good_ real world implementation of
your model in the near future, even with the help of deities.
On paper the dear USA is good model, in practice it is a
Ponzi scheme (check the debt).
If you implement your model now, here are some difficulties
about implementation:
1. Software/hardware is full of batshit. This empowers
2. Your humans will include current mafia/overlords (unless
you manage to kill them all, which might be considered bad
by sheeple).
3. Humans are relatively easy to exploit, search for `clinton blowjob scandal` (no quotes).

I suppose I trolled about GHC:  Since I am in a trolling mood, let me give you the following
benchmark to check your favorite language for speed:
The fibonacci numbers: are defined by the linear recurrence:
F(0)=0,F(1)=1,F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) [1].
Using numerology, you can compute F(n) in O(log(n)).
Compute F(n) via the slow recurrence [1].
Question: In haskell (or in your favourite language), how
long does it take to compute F(2^32) modulo 2^32?
Modulo 2^32 means working with C int's.
The haskell fanatic called this "micro-benchmark".
If you work in excel, you don't care if the popup shows in
0.1 or in 0.9 seconds.
If you work with loops to 2^34, you might care if you use C
or haskell IMHO.

I suppose I trolled about GHC:  Since I am in a trolling mood, let me give you the following
benchmark to check your favorite language for speed:
The fibonacci numbers: are defined by the linear recurrence:
F(0)=0,F(1)=1,F(n)=F(n-1)+F(n-2) [1].
Using numerology, you can compute F(n) in O(log(n)).
Compute F(n) via the slow recurrence [1].
Question: In haskell (or in your favourite language), how
long does it take to compute F(2^32) modulo 2^32?
Modulo 2^32 means working with C int's.
The haskell fanatic called this "micro-benchmark".
If you work in excel, you don't care if the popup shows in
0.1 or in 0.9 seconds.
If you work with loops to 2^34, you might care if you use C
or haskell IMHO.

It is well known fact that Micro$oft used *BSD TCP stack in earlier

grepping for "Berkeley" returned the bsd license in userland, likely
in the shit called "ftp.exe".

Fiat Chrysler said exploiting the flaw "required unique and extensive

Dude, this is a rant.
Why do you want "free markets" when the real world is rooted?
The majority of actors are just "rooted", so they are not
rational, irrational, ... hyper-transcendental, they are "rooted".
Capitalism is good on paper. Socialism is good on paper.
It is the realword implementation that matters, not the ad.
About "free markets":
"free market" is a buzzword, commonly used for spam.
Are banks "free market"?
IMHO banks are pyramids (AKA ponzi scheme).
It is tempting to make a change by going banks go boom,
but this likely will have too much collateral damage for people and not for "rooters".
Are "stock markets" free markets?

If there is a negative real interest rate, it means that the inflation
rate is greater than the nominal interest rate. If the Federal funds
rate is 2% and the inflation rate is 10%, then the borrower would gain
7.27% of every dollar borrowed per year.
Since 2010, the U.S. Treasury has been obtaining negative real interest
rates on government debt, meaning the inflation rate is greater than the
interest rate paid on the debt.[29]

If there is a negative real interest rate, it means that the inflation
rate is greater than the nominal interest rate. If the Federal funds
rate is 2% and the inflation rate is 10%, then the borrower would gain
7.27% of every dollar borrowed per year.
Since 2010, the U.S. Treasury has been obtaining negative real interest
rates on government debt, meaning the inflation rate is greater than the
interest rate paid on the debt.[29]

To dumb me you appear utopist.
Please explain in simple words the IMPLEMENTATION of your New Order (in
case you have order).
In particular explain:
1. How do you distribute goods (food, shelter, shiny J-Pads, money? etc)
2. How do you deal with dishonest people and criminals?
3. How do you deal with people against your New Order?
4. How do you deal with current oligarchs in the New Order?
5. How do you prevent corruption?
IMHO a major problem is that sheeple are too buggy/easy to manipulate
and don't want freedom, they just want shiny J-Pads, facebook, etc.

If there is a negative real interest rate, it means that the inflation
rate is greater than the nominal interest rate. If the Federal funds
rate is 2% and the inflation rate is 10%, then the borrower would gain
7.27% of every dollar borrowed per year.

     2. Verify that when the p,q generation procedure of [FIPS-186]
        Appendix 2 is followed with seed 'seed', that p is found when
        'counter' = pgenCounter.
The main problem appears MAY.
As I read it, implementation MAY NOT verify it.
Sketch of the attack:
Chose $q$ product of small primes $p_i$.
Solve the discrete logarithm modulo $p_i$ for the public keys.
Apply the Chinese remainder theorem to get the privates keys.
(This is well known method for DL and for this reason
the group order must be prime [160 bits ;)]).
Would be interested how implementations implement this MAY.
Let me know if there is better list for this.

2631 is on wikipedia's page for DH.
Another concern for backdoor is the FIPS in this thread,
which requires small subgroup (as low as 160 bits).
Having in mind for generic primes DL is subexponential
(IIRC something like GNFS), the complexity of DL in
small subgroup is questionable.
Just to note so far this thread questions:
1. DH's RFC
2. DSA as implemented by openssl
3. FIPS requiring small subgroup.

If you feel like debugging RFC, start from:
RFC:  2119
5. MAY   This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is
truly optional.
This includes many backdoors per lack of formalism.
IMHO RFC must use only MUST or "MUST NOT" to make
the ``formal model'' soundly defined (recursively RFC compliant).
Suppose implementation X1 follows MAY and X2 does not.
Observe that in real world neither X1 nor X2 need be
RFC compliant (like malware).
Even if they are compliant, this might cause troubles.
In my DSA SSL example (which might be technical bug in openssl,
but not necessarily technical bug in hypothetical DH implementation),
the key/cert wasn't RFC compliant, but passed verification.

OK, you might be right.
Summary of my verbiage on this list is here:
besides DH:
2) openssl 1.0.1p accepts composite $q$ in DSA
3) fips 160? forces small subgroup as low as 160 bits
and openssl 1.0.1p insists on this.
The repeat, the DL is subexponential in the whole group
of order $p-1$ and I don't exclude the possibility to
be easier in the small forced subgroup.

Re "formal verification".
I am skidiot at formal verification (FW).
So far my best achievement in FW is
"Axiom free proof of False" in Coq (is it Cock?).
I did this by native code execution via plugins
in Coq (the plugins were part of the "pr00f"),
which in theory can falsify other proofs
depending on the file permissions.
Much letter I learned that the lovely micro$oft
heavily depend on plugins in their Cock "pr00fs" and
accidentally something broke the check of the
"pr00f" for result of significant importance (something like "coqchk") due to some fault in the plugin and/or Coq.
The p00f failure was discussed on academic site.
In short, I consider Coq a charlatan tool,
and likely security vulnerability, since a proof
can easily execute native code.

Summary:  libressl-2.2.3 and openssl-1.0.1p appear to accept elliptic
curves which might be broken by Pollard's rho DL in O(2^56) or O(2^82)
group operations
Pollard's rho DL algorithm [1] solves discrete logarithm in O(\sqrt{n})
where n is the group order. Equivalently the complexity is
Both libressl-2.2.3 and openssl-1.0.1p have curves with
log_2{n}=112 and NIST curve with log_2{n}=163.
Assuming Pollard's rho succeeds, the complexity is O(2^56) and O(2^82)
group operations.
The first is close to real time on ``nice hardware''.
To reproduce:
$ ~/inst/openssl-1.0.1p/apps/openssl ecparam -list_curves
 secp112r1 : SECG/WTLS curve over a 112 bit prime field
  sect163k1 : NIST/SECG/WTLS curve over a 163 bit binary field
$ ~/inst/libressl-2.2.3/apps/openssl ecparam -list_curves|grep -i ' 1'
   secp112r1 : SECG/WTLS curve over a 112 bit prime field
   sect163k1 : NIST/SECG/WTLS curve over a 163 bit binary field
For reference,
Bitcoin networks surpasses 2^80 hashes per week
I believe in an Edward model of EC, the group operation on the EC
isn't much slower than Bitcoin SHA hash, so someone with such
resources might break ...2r1 in nearly real time and ...3k1 in few
This resembles the ``DSA oddity'' of _forcing_ q as low as 160
bits, giving the same level (to ...3k1) of security compared to
DSA as shown at [2], search for "160"

secp112r1 : SECG/WTLS curve over a 112 bit prime field
secp112r2 : SECG curve over a 112 bit prime field

(CC'ing cypherpunks for trolling reasons).
Your argument raises the question about the soundness
of the so called ``theory of many eyes''.
libressl/openssl ship elliptic curves of low quality,
and they can be detected by man documented command.
The low quality of the curves can be checked by going
to wikipedia's page about ECC dlog records.
AFAICT they probably implemented backdoored RFC (don't know if they knew it is backdoored).
This raises the question about more obscure features
buried in, say, obscure macros, misleading comments, etc.
No math knowledge required, but the low quality curves are weaker
that the backdoored DSA via generic dlog attack, unless
DSA allows much faster dlog in the small subgroup by exploiting the sub-exponential attack of dlog modulo $p$
(or some other attack).

Volkswagen is being rightly condemned from all directions, as its
methods were particularly cynical: its engine software would sense when
the car was in a test environment and cut back NO_x output temporarily.
As soon as the car was no longer under test, the car would change mode
and emit huge amounts of NO_x. This wasn't done for no reason – if a
machine is allowed to generate NO_x freely, it can be very
fuel-efficient – and thus, of course, its carbon emissions can be very
low too.

AFAICT this was discovered by scholars, not regulators

Cheating EPA appears to be common practice:
In 1973, Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Toyota, and
Volkswagen had to remove ambient temperature switches which affected
emissions, though the companies denied intentional cheating and said
that strategies like enriching fuel mixture during cold engine warm-up
periods could reduce overall pollution.
In 1996 General Motors had to pay a near-record fine of $11 million, and
had to recall almost as many cars as Volkswagen's US TDI diesels,
470,000, when they, like Volkswagen, programmed ECU software to
disengage emissions controls during conditions known to exist when the
cars were not being lab tested by the EPA.
There are more cases linked.

I am n00b at crypto so this might not make any sense.
In DH, if one can select group parameters (g,q,p) he can break both parties
private very fast time IMHO.
The RFC:  The main problem appears:
2.2.2.  Group Parameter Validation
   The ASN.1 for DH keys in [PKIX] includes elements j and validation-
   Parms which MAY be used by recipients of a key to verify that the
   group parameters were correctly generated. Two checks are possible:
     1. Verify that p=qj + 1. This demonstrates that the parameters meet
        the X9.42 parameter criteria.
     2. Verify that when the p,q generation procedure of [FIPS-186]
        Appendix 2 is followed with seed 'seed', that p is found when
        'counter' = pgenCounter.
The main problem appears MAY.
As I read it, implementation MAY NOT verify it.
Sketch of the attack:
Chose $q$ product of small primes $p_i$.
Solve the discrete logarithm modulo $p_i$ for the public keys.
Apply the Chinese remainder theorem to get the privates keys.
(This is well known method for DL and for this reason
the group order must be prime [160 bits ;)]).

If you feel like debugging RFC, start from:
RFC:  2119
5. MAY   This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is
truly optional.
This includes many backdoors per lack of formalism.
IMHO RFC must use only MUST or "MUST NOT" to make
the ``formal model'' soundly defined (recursively RFC compliant).
Suppose implementation X1 follows MAY and X2 does not.
Observe that in real world neither X1 nor X2 need be
RFC compliant (like malware).
Even if they are compliant, this might cause troubles.
In my DSA SSL example (which might be technical bug in openssl,
but not necessarily technical bug in hypothetical DH implementation),
the key/cert wasn't RFC compliant, but passed verification.

OK, you might be right.
Summary of my verbiage on this list is here:
besides DH:
2) openssl 1.0.1p accepts composite $q$ in DSA
3) fips 160? forces small subgroup as low as 160 bits
and openssl 1.0.1p insists on this.
The repeat, the DL is subexponential in the whole group
of order $p-1$ and I don't exclude the possibility to
be easier in the small forced subgroup.

Re "formal verification".
I am skidiot at formal verification (FW).
So far my best achievement in FW is
"Axiom free proof of False" in Coq (is it Cock?).
I did this by native code execution via plugins
in Coq (the plugins were part of the "pr00f"),
which in theory can falsify other proofs
depending on the file permissions.
Much letter I learned that the lovely micro$oft
heavily depend on plugins in their Cock "pr00fs" and
accidentally something broke the check of the
"pr00f" for result of significant importance (something like "coqchk") due to some fault in the plugin and/or Coq.
The p00f failure was discussed on academic site.
In short, I consider Coq a charlatan tool,
and likely security vulnerability, since a proof
can easily execute native code.

Summary:  libressl-2.2.3 and openssl-1.0.1p appear to accept elliptic
curves which might be broken by Pollard's rho DL in O(2^56) or O(2^82)
group operations
Pollard's rho DL algorithm [1] solves discrete logarithm in O(\sqrt{n})
where n is the group order. Equivalently the complexity is
Both libressl-2.2.3 and openssl-1.0.1p have curves with
log_2{n}=112 and NIST curve with log_2{n}=163.
Assuming Pollard's rho succeeds, the complexity is O(2^56) and O(2^82)
group operations.
The first is close to real time on ``nice hardware''.
To reproduce:
$ ~/inst/openssl-1.0.1p/apps/openssl ecparam -list_curves
 secp112r1 : SECG/WTLS curve over a 112 bit prime field
  sect163k1 : NIST/SECG/WTLS curve over a 163 bit binary field
$ ~/inst/libressl-2.2.3/apps/openssl ecparam -list_curves|grep -i ' 1'
   secp112r1 : SECG/WTLS curve over a 112 bit prime field
   sect163k1 : NIST/SECG/WTLS curve over a 163 bit binary field
For reference,
Bitcoin networks surpasses 2^80 hashes per week
I believe in an Edward model of EC, the group operation on the EC
isn't much slower than Bitcoin SHA hash, so someone with such
resources might break ...2r1 in nearly real time and ...3k1 in few
This resembles the ``DSA oddity'' of _forcing_ q as low as 160
bits, giving the same level (to ...3k1) of security compared to
DSA as shown at [2], search for "160"

(CC'ing cypherpunks at cpunks.org for trolling reasons).
Your argument raises the question about the soundness
of the so called ``theory of many eyes''.
libressl/openssl ship elliptic curves of low quality,
and they can be detected by man documented command.
The low quality of the curves can be checked by going
to wikipedia's page about ECC dlog records.
AFAICT they probably implemented backdoored RFC (don't know if they knew it is backdoored).
This raises the question about more obscure features
buried in, say, obscure macros, misleading comments, etc.
No math knowledge required, but the low quality curves are weaker
that the backdoored DSA via generic dlog attack, unless
DSA allows much faster dlog in the small subgroup by exploiting the sub-exponential attack of dlog modulo $p$
(or some other attack).

New documents revealing GCHQ's mass-surveillance activities have

@_subject: Allegedly Volkswagen cheated to both governments and lusers 
Volkswagen is being rightly condemned from all directions, as its
methods were particularly cynical: its engine software would sense when
the car was in a test environment and cut back NO_x output temporarily.
As soon as the car was no longer under test, the car would change mode
and emit huge amounts of NO_x. This wasn't done for no reason – if a
machine is allowed to generate NO_x freely, it can be very
fuel-efficient – and thus, of course, its carbon emissions can be very
low too.
Probably best defense for VW lawyers is:
"We got hacked and the hack made this.
We take sickyouareity seriously"

AFAICT this was discovered by scholars, not regulators
(check wikipedia link).
Cheating EPA appears to be common practice:
In 1973, Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Toyota, and
Volkswagen had to remove ambient temperature switches which affected
emissions, though the companies denied intentional cheating and said
that strategies like enriching fuel mixture during cold engine warm-up
periods could reduce overall pollution.
In 1996 General Motors had to pay a near-record fine of $11 million, and
had to recall almost as many cars as Volkswagen's US TDI diesels,
470,000, when they, like Volkswagen, programmed ECU software to
disengage emissions controls during conditions known to exist when the
cars were not being lab tested by the EPA.
There are more cases linked.

Possible crypto backdoor in RFC-2631 Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Method
I am n00b at crypto so this might not make any sense.
In DH, if one can select group parameters (g,q,p) he can break both parties
private very fast time IMHO.
The RFC:  The main problem appears:
2.2.2.  Group Parameter Validation
   The ASN.1 for DH keys in [PKIX] includes elements j and validation-
   Parms which MAY be used by recipients of a key to verify that the
   group parameters were correctly generated. Two checks are possible:
     1. Verify that p=qj + 1. This demonstrates that the parameters meet
        the X9.42 parameter criteria.
     2. Verify that when the p,q generation procedure of [FIPS-186]
        Appendix 2 is followed with seed 'seed', that p is found when
        'counter' = pgenCounter.
The main problem appears MAY.
As I read it, implementation MAY NOT verify it.
Sketch of the attack:
Chose $q$ product of small primes $p_i$.
Solve the discrete logarithm modulo $p_i$ for the public keys.
Apply the Chinese remainder theorem to get the privates keys.
(This is well known method for DL and for this reason
the group order must be prime [160 bits ;)]).
Would be interested how implementations implement this MAY.

2631 is on wikipedia's page for DH.
Another concern for backdoor is the FIPS in this thread,
which requires small subgroup (as low as 160 bits).
Having in mind for generic primes DL is subexponential
(IIRC something like GNFS), the complexity of DL in
small subgroup is questionable.
Just to note so far this thread questions:
1. DH's RFC
2. DSA as implemented by openssl
3. FIPS requiring small subgroup.

If you feel like debugging RFC, start from:
RFC:  2119
5. MAY   This word, or the adjective "OPTIONAL", mean that an item is
truly optional.
This includes many backdoors per lack of formalism.
IMHO RFC must use only MUST or "MUST NOT" to make
the ``formal model'' soundly defined (recursively RFC compliant).
Suppose implementation X1 follows MAY and X2 does not.
Observe that in real world neither X1 nor X2 need be
RFC compliant (like malware).
Even if they are compliant, this might cause troubles.
In my DSA SSL example (which might be technical bug in openssl,
but not necessarily technical bug in hypothetical DH implementation),
the key/cert wasn't RFC compliant, but passed verification.

besides DH:
2) openssl 1.0.1p accepts composite $q$ in DSA
3) fips 160? forces small subgroup as low as 160 bits
and openssl 1.0.1p insists on this.
The repeat, the DL is subexponential in the whole group
of order $p-1$ and I don't exclude the possibility to
be easier in the small forced subgroup.

Re "formal verification".
I am skidiot at formal verification (FW).
So far my best achievement in FW is
"Axiom free proof of False" in Coq (is it Cock?).
I did this by native code execution via plugins
in Coq (the plugins were part of the "pr00f"),
which in theory can falsify other proofs
depending on the file permissions.
Much letter I learned that the lovely micro$oft
heavily depend on plugins in their Cock "pr00fs" and
accidentally something broke the check of the
"pr00f" for result of significant importance (something like "coqchk") due to some fault in the plugin and/or Coq.
The p00f failure was discussed on academic site.
In short, I consider Coq a charlatan tool,
and likely security vulnerability, since a proof
can easily execute native code.

Summary:  libressl-2.2.3 and openssl-1.0.1p appear to accept elliptic
curves which might be broken by Pollard's rho DL in O(2^56) or O(2^82)
group operations
Pollard's rho DL algorithm [1] solves discrete logarithm in O(\sqrt{n})
where n is the group order. Equivalently the complexity is
Both libressl-2.2.3 and openssl-1.0.1p have curves with
log_2{n}=112 and NIST curve with log_2{n}=163.
Assuming Pollard's rho succeeds, the complexity is O(2^56) and O(2^82)
group operations.
The first is close to real time on ``nice hardware''.
To reproduce:
$ ~/inst/openssl-1.0.1p/apps/openssl ecparam -list_curves
 secp112r1 : SECG/WTLS curve over a 112 bit prime field
  sect163k1 : NIST/SECG/WTLS curve over a 163 bit binary field
$ ~/inst/libressl-2.2.3/apps/openssl ecparam -list_curves|grep -i ' 1'
   secp112r1 : SECG/WTLS curve over a 112 bit prime field
   sect163k1 : NIST/SECG/WTLS curve over a 163 bit binary field
For reference,
Bitcoin networks surpasses 2^80 hashes per week
I believe in an Edward model of EC, the group operation on the EC
isn't much slower than Bitcoin SHA hash, so someone with such
resources might break ...2r1 in nearly real time and ...3k1 in few
This resembles the ``DSA oddity'' of _forcing_ q as low as 160
bits, giving the same level (to ...3k1) of security compared to
DSA as shown at [2], search for "160"

secp128r2 : SECG curve over a 128 bit prime field

(CC'ing cypherpunks at cpunks.org for trolling reasons).
Your argument raises the question about the soundness
of the so called ``theory of many eyes''.
libressl/openssl ship elliptic curves of low quality,
and they can be detected by man documented command.
The low quality of the curves can be checked by going
to wikipedia's page about ECC dlog records.
AFAICT they probably implemented backdoored RFC (don't know if they knew it is backdoored).
This raises the question about more obscure features
buried in, say, obscure macros, misleading comments, etc.
No math knowledge required, but the low quality curves are weaker
that the backdoored DSA via generic dlog attack, unless
DSA allows much faster dlog in the small subgroup by exploiting the sub-exponential attack of dlog modulo $p$
(or some other attack).

Volkswagen is being rightly condemned from all directions, as its
methods were particularly cynical: its engine software would sense when
the car was in a test environment and cut back NO_x output temporarily.
As soon as the car was no longer under test, the car would change mode
and emit huge amounts of NO_x. This wasn't done for no reason – if a
machine is allowed to generate NO_x freely, it can be very
fuel-efficient – and thus, of course, its carbon emissions can be very
low too.

Cheating EPA appears to be common practice:
In 1973, Chrysler, Ford Motor Company, General Motors, Toyota, and
Volkswagen had to remove ambient temperature switches which affected
emissions, though the companies denied intentional cheating and said
that strategies like enriching fuel mixture during cold engine warm-up
periods could reduce overall pollution.
In 1996 General Motors had to pay a near-record fine of $11 million, and
had to recall almost as many cars as Volkswagen's US TDI diesels,
470,000, when they, like Volkswagen, programmed ECU software to
disengage emissions controls during conditions known to exist when the
cars were not being lab tested by the EPA.

IIRC they are formed from some crypto stuff of the user and the user
has _some_ control of it at least via bruteforce.
I suspect the user can't chose the address directly.

I think the analogy shows that FTL (superluminal) speed exist and is
experimentally observed, this doesn't contradict relativity.
What contradicts relativity is _communication_ or clock synchronization

this light on Moon will move FTL at least from your point of view. Jim's horse was something like this.

Yeah -- a crash is still expected, even in a "good" build with the fix.  The difference is whether the crash is safe or not.  (Per beginning of comment 13, we'd like to avoid crashing at all, but it's simpler to just abort safely in the error condition for now.)
To validate the fix, you should load the interactive testcase and trigger the crash, and then go ahead and submit the crash and check the crash signature. A "bad" crash looks like this:
A "good" crash will look a bit different -- it should at least have a "crash address" of 0x0 or close to that, I think.  I'm not sure exactly how it'll look because I don't have a expected-"good" build handy. Do you have a link to the build that you're testing?
Hi Daniel,
I just tested it on Windows 10 pro (x64). The crash address is "0x7ff9fb1c05c0". I am not sure if we expected that. Thanks.
Thanks, Cynthia.  I believe the presence of "MOZ_RELEASE_ASSERT" in that crash report means all is well. (Additionally, the backtrace confirms that we're crashing on that new assertion line in AddMilestone, which is just before we set ourselves up for trouble.)
I guess MOZ_RELEASE_ASSERT produces a non-null crash address on Windows for some reason; not sure why. But I think that crash report is still fine -- MOZ_RELEASE_ASSERT should be all that we need to look for here.

First, the extended commit message has "MozReview-Commit-ID: 9 feedbacker at example.com" on its last line. That looks like a mistake? MozReview-Commit-ID is supposed to contain a longer UUID (longer than "9" :))
Yeah, the weird commit message is because Emacs dies while I was editing it while uploading, so there was some extra meta data in there. Sorry about that. I'll fix up the AutoRestore stuff, I was just being lazy.
Yeah -- a crash is still expected, even in a "good" build with the fix.  The difference is whether the crash is safe or not.  (Per beginning of comment 13, we'd like to avoid crashing at all, but it's simpler to just abort safely in the error condition for now.)
To validate the fix, you should load the interactive testcase and trigger the crash, and then go ahead and submit the crash and check the crash signature. A "bad" crash looks like this:
A "good" crash will look a bit different -- it should at least have a "crash address" of 0x0 or close to that, I think.  I'm not sure exactly how it'll look because I don't have a expected-"good" build handy. Do you have a link to the build that you're testing?
Hi Daniel,
I just tested it on Windows 10 pro (x64). The crash address is "0x7ff9fb1c05c0". I am not sure if we expected that. Thanks.
Thanks, Cynthia.  I believe the presence of "MOZ_RELEASE_ASSERT" in that crash report means all is well. (Additionally, the backtrace confirms that we're crashing on that new assertion line in AddMilestone, which is just before we set ourselves up for trouble.)
I guess MOZ_RELEASE_ASSERT produces a non-null crash address on Windows for some reason; not sure why. But I think that crash report is still fine -- MOZ_RELEASE_ASSERT should be all that we need to look for here.

At [2] Tor (and/or DoD) confess:
NSA and the like  definitely can "see" traffic almost everywhere,
so Tor doesn't protect against the NSA, right? (some people learnt
this the hard way).
IMHO the first fucking thing Tor must do is to make the user click
at least three times on the above disclaimer.

Is it theoretically possible at all to make low latency anonymity
of sufficiently decent quality?

"sufficiently decent" is not well defined i agree.
Replace "sufficiently decent" by "perfect", or define it to be "provably
intractable" and do not assume hardness not proved unconditionally, like
P != NP.

Is jitter/fill traffic full solution?
What if they disrupt or slow X times your traffic to Tor?
This will be observable at the other end.
Probably easier is to just own me via some application
sploit (as suggested in this thread).
RE:  cost of ownage/minor offenses.
Don't exclude the possibility single investment to result
in compromise of all of Tor and then deanonimizing will
be just a simple query.
In one Snowden slide there was something like:
"NSA can deanonimize some Tor users ...
but we don't want to scare all of them".
This is consistent with the fate of Lulzsec.
According to the official story (which I don't believe),
the first of them got caught because "he forgot to use

Searching the web for "tor timing attacks" (without quotes)

Short summary and PoC is at [1].
At [2] Tor (and/or DoD) confess:
NSA and the like  definitely can "see" traffic almost everywhere,
so Tor doesn't protect against the NSA, right? (some people learnt
this the hard way).
IMHO the first fucking thing Tor must do is to make the user click
at least three times on the above disclaimer.
Trying to make the rant on topic:
Is it theoretically possible at all to make low latency anonymity
of sufficiently decent quality?

As I asked in this thread:

"sufficiently decent" is not well defined i agree.
Replace "sufficiently decent" by "perfect", or define it to be "provably
intractable" and do not assume hardness not proved unconditionally, like

RE:  cost of ownage/minor offenses.
Don't exclude the possibility single investment to result
in compromise of all of Tor and then deanonimizing will
be just a simple query.
In one Snowden slide there was something like:
"NSA can deanonimize some Tor users ...
but we don't want to scare all of them".
This is consistent with the fate of Lulzsec.

GnuPG's ElGamal signing keys compromised
Phong Nguyen identified a severe bug in the way GnuPG creates and uses

which can lead to a compromise of almost all ElGamal keys used for
signing.  Note that this is a real world vulnerability which will

First they poison them, then they ``heal'' them...
In the years following the Vietnam War reports, of high rates of miscarriages, premature births, congenital birth defects, and infant mortality began to surface from regions in Vietnam where Agent Orange was used.
the United States Government passed the Agent Orange Act. This act mandates the US government to pay for the medical care of any Vietnam War veteran, regardless of length of service, related to an Agent Orange disease.
IIRC, the USA gave its Vietnamese soldiers psychoactive drugs (some
for being brave) and some of the drugs were found to have very
adverse side effects. Don't have better reference ATM than this:
The British philosopher Nick Land aptly described the Vietnam War as “a decisive point of intersection between pharmacology and the technology of violence.”
Committee on Crime revealed that from 1966 to 1969, the armed forces had used 225 million tablets of stimulants, mostly Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine), an amphetamine derivative that is nearly twice as strong as the Benzedrine used in the Second World War.

GnuPG's ElGamal signing keys compromised
Phong Nguyen identified a severe bug in the way GnuPG creates and uses
ElGamal keys for signing.  This is a significant security failure
which can lead to a compromise of almost all ElGamal keys used for
signing.  Note that this is a real world vulnerability which will
reveal your private key within a few seconds.
Do you mean to see more like this from gpg?
IIRC gpg used small number, to save picoseconds in computations
and the attack fucked them with lattice reduction in nanoseconds...

Long ago, an old man told me wars like in Vietnam were done for beta

First they poison them, then they ``heal'' them...
In the years following the Vietnam War reports, of high rates of miscarriages, premature births, congenital birth defects, and infant mortality began to surface from regions in Vietnam where Agent Orange was used.
the United States Government passed the Agent Orange Act. This act mandates the US government to pay for the medical care of any Vietnam War veteran, regardless of length of service, related to an Agent Orange disease.
IIRC, the USA gave its Vietnamese soldiers psychoactive drugs (some
for being brave) and some of the drugs were found to have very
adverse side effects. Don't have better reference ATM than this:
The British philosopher Nick Land aptly described the Vietnam War as “a decisive point of intersection between pharmacology and the technology of violence.”
Committee on Crime revealed that from 1966 to 1969, the armed forces had used 225 million tablets of stimulants, mostly Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine), an amphetamine derivative that is nearly twice as strong as the Benzedrine used in the Second World War.

GnuPG's ElGamal signing keys compromised
Phong Nguyen identified a severe bug in the way GnuPG creates and uses
ElGamal keys for signing.  This is a significant security failure
which can lead to a compromise of almost all ElGamal keys used for
signing.  Note that this is a real world vulnerability which will
reveal your private key within a few seconds.
Do you mean to see more like this from gpg?
IIRC gpg used small number, to save picoseconds in computations
and the attack fucked them with lattice reduction in nanoseconds...
Not to mention the compatibility with pgp 0.0001, which makes
keyid collisions trivial (the ubuntu comrades suffered from this
few times).

The protesters are protesting, the screwing is going on with some

Long ago, an old man told me wars like in Vietnam were done for beta
testing of weapons and dangerous stuff, especially the side effects.
First they poison them, then they ``heal'' them...
In the years following the Vietnam War reports, of high rates of miscarriages, premature births, congenital birth defects, and infant mortality began to surface from regions in Vietnam where Agent Orange was used.
the United States Government passed the Agent Orange Act. This act mandates the US government to pay for the medical care of any Vietnam War veteran, regardless of length of service, related to an Agent Orange disease.
IIRC, the USA gave its Vietnamese soldiers psychoactive drugs (some
for being brave) and some of the drugs were found to have very
adverse side effects. Don't have better reference ATM than this:
The British philosopher Nick Land aptly described the Vietnam War as “a decisive point of intersection between pharmacology and the technology of violence.”
Committee on Crime revealed that from 1966 to 1969, the armed forces had used 225 million tablets of stimulants, mostly Dexedrine (dextroamphetamine), an amphetamine derivative that is nearly twice as strong as the Benzedrine used in the Second World War.

RE:  cost of ownage/minor offenses.
Don't exclude the possibility single investment to result
in compromise of all of Tor and then deanonimizing will
be just a simple query.
In one Snowden slide there was something like:
"NSA can deanonimize some Tor users ...
but we don't want to scare all of them".
This is consistent with the fate of Lulzsec.

Yes, it is known that quantum computers will break at least most of today's
public key crypto (factoring, discrete logarithms) very efficiently.
Several years ago IBM tested this in practice with the toy experiment of
factoring 15.
Some cryptographers are preparing for the day when quantum computers
will come -- the buzzword is "post-quantum cryptography".
I am a newbie at this and suspect the full potential of quantum
computers is not currently known (AFAICT it is open if they will break SAT).

Yes, it is known that quantum computers will break at least most of today's
public key crypto (factoring, discrete logarithms) very efficiently.
Several years ago IBM tested this in practice with the toy experiment of
factoring 15.
Some cryptographers are preparing for the day when quantum computers
will come -- the buzzword is "post-quantum cryptography".
I am a newbie at this and suspect the full potential of quantum
computers is not currently known (AFAICT it is open if they will break SAT).

I think this could be some crypto/SSL issue, consider asking them.
This applies to straightforward implementation. openssl is
protecting against timing attacks, which additionally slows, but
unless there is bug, the load shouldn't jump so much.
A 2010 thread discusses timings with sign/verify with 100K bit RSA
keys, pycrypt (python + some libraries) is significantly faster than
openssl. The keys/certs are somewhere on the interwebs:
inconsistent timings for rsa sign/verify with 100K bit rsa keys

square root in the subexponential stuff or the constants
significantly lower.

It is strongly recommended that all cryptographic key material which has been generated by OpenSSL versions starting with 0.9.8c-1
on Debian systems is recreated from scratch. Furthermore, all DSA
keys ever used on affected Debian systems for signing or authentication purposes should be considered compromised; the Digital Signature Algorithm relies on a secret random value used during signature generation.

Mr. Kuhlmann decided that enough was enough, and he was going to take some action. As of mICQ 0.4.10.1, the code will, when built for the Debian distribution, print out a message which says some unflattering things about Mr. Loschwitz and encourages use of a different version; the program then exits. In other words, when built for Debian, mICQ thumbs its nose at the user and refuses to run. To help ensure that this code got into the official Debian version, it was written in an obfuscated manner, set to trigger only after February 11, and only if it was not being run by Mr. Loschwitz. For the curious, here is a posting containing the code in question.

Two distinct DSA keys sign a file with the same signature. Is this repudiation issue?
I have two distinct DSA keys k_1 and k_2, p_i are distinct 1024 bit
primes and q_i are 160 bit primes (easily can be made larger).
The other parameters of the keys are distinct, counting congruences.
On openssl 1.0.1t they produce exactly the same signature on a file:
$ openssl dgst -sha1 -verify key1.pub -signature file.txt.sig file.txt ; openssl dgst -sha1 -verify key2.pub -signature file.txt.sig file.txt
Verified OK
Verified OK
In addition I created with them two valid self signed x509 certificates.
The key owners can claim the other one made the signature,
which appears crypto repudiation issue.

Well, they are _distinct_, including congruence equivalence, but I have
other pairs with the same properties, so it is not the same key
definitely -- p_i and q_i are distinct primes and the rest parameters
too. I generated them with a proggie and checked, also with openssl -text.
Also the x509 self signed certs with the private keys work with
openssl s_client/s_server.

Posting the keys/certs/private keys, this is the README:
Distinct DSA keys produce valid single signature of single file
and the x509 certificates from the private keys work on openssl 1.0.2j
Tested on openssl 1.0.2j (latest and 1.0.1t latest) on Debian 8.
The keys (also private are attached).
Also at We got a triple of distinct DSA keys (key1,key2,key3) which
successfully verify a single signature of a single file.
By ``distinct" we count congruences, the p_i and q_i are distinct.
$ openssl dgst -sha1 -verify key1.pub -signature file.txt.sig2 file.txt ; openssl dgst -sha1 -verify key2.pub -signature file.txt.sig2 file.txt ;openssl dgst -sha1 -verify key3.pub -signature file.txt.sig2 file.txt

Slightly harder to reverse pair of keys with the same properties is
$ openssl dgst -sha1 -verify key3.pub -signature file.txt.sig3 file.txt ; openssl dgst -sha1 -verify key4.pub -signature file.txt.sig3 file.txt
Verified OK
Verified OK
To produce other signatures: choose a key from the two sets and do:
$openssl dgst -sign key1.priv -out file.txt.sig file.txt
Then verify, which may fail with probability about 1/2 for the first
set and about 8/9 for the second set because of the random DSA $k$.
Deterministic signatures are possible, but not possible with unpatched
For the x509 certs:
cert1 works always.
cert2 works with probability about 1/2, to check:
$ openssl s_server -accept 8080 -cert cert2 -key key2.priv  -www
$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:8080
For client lynx(1) works too, with innocent warning about self signed
and CN mismatch.
In case of error, repeat few times.
cert4 works with probability about 1/3.
Sketch of the numerology behind it.
For and overview of the simple DSA, check Wikipedia or better source.
The main idea is to use low multiplicative order of the generator $g$,
which is expected to be of multiplicative order $q$ (at least 160 bit)
prime modulo $p$.
The signature is (r,s), where for random $k$,
r=(g^k mod p) moq q
s=some function of x,k,r,MESSAGE
The public key is y=g^x mod p.
The signature is valid iff $r=v, v=g^f_1(r,s) y^f_2(r,s)=g^f_3(x,r,s)$
We choose $g_i$ of low multiplicative order modulo $p_i$, for (key3,key4)
it is $3$.
Whenever the "random" $k$ (for the first key of the pair)is multiple of $3$, r=1 mod p mod q
and $v=g^f_3_i(x_i,1,s_i)$. Since there are no congruence
obstructions, f_3_i(x_i,1,s_i) can both bi divisible by $3$,
giving $v_1=v_2=r=1$.
This is very easy to verify in a toy implementation or in python's
Choosing $g=1$ as in key1 works for all $p_i,q_i$ and the private
exponent $x$ doesn't matter.
Theoretically the keys are invalid, but the valid x509 certificates
working in |openssl s_client| and lynx suggest lack of key validation.

@_subject: 4096 bit SSL keys 
I think this could be some crypto/SSL issue, consider asking them.
This applies to straightforward implementation. openssl is
protecting against timing attacks, which additionally slows, but
unless there is bug, the load shouldn't jump so much.
A 2010 thread discusses timings with sign/verify with 100K bit RSA
keys, pycrypt (python + some libraries) is significantly faster than
openssl. The keys/certs are somewhere on the interwebs:
inconsistent timings for rsa sign/verify with 100K bit rsa keys
sign      verify
key1 5min  <1sec
key2 48min 21min
(tested on patched openssl1.0.0a)
Besides quantum computers, another threat is private factoring
algorithm, sufficiently faster than the public ones. Say one more
square root in the subexponential stuff or the constants
significantly lower.

It is strongly recommended that all cryptographic key material which has been generated by OpenSSL versions starting with 0.9.8c-1
on Debian systems is recreated from scratch. Furthermore, all DSA
keys ever used on affected Debian systems for signing or authentication purposes should be considered compromised; the Digital Signature Algorithm relies on a secret random value used during signature generation.

Mr. Kuhlmann decided that enough was enough, and he was going to take some action. As of mICQ 0.4.10.1, the code will, when built for the Debian distribution, print out a message which says some unflattering things about Mr. Loschwitz and encourages use of a different version; the program then exits. In other words, when built for Debian, mICQ thumbs its nose at the user and refuses to run. To help ensure that this code got into the official Debian version, it was written in an obfuscated manner, set to trigger only after February 11, and only if it was not being run by Mr. Loschwitz. For the curious, here is a posting containing the code in question.

Two distinct DSA keys sign a file with the same signature. Is this repudiation issue?
I have two distinct DSA keys k_1 and k_2, p_i are distinct 1024 bit
primes and q_i are 160 bit primes (easily can be made larger).
The other parameters of the keys are distinct, counting congruences.
On openssl 1.0.1t they produce exactly the same signature on a file:
$ openssl dgst -sha1 -verify key1.pub -signature file.txt.sig file.txt ; openssl dgst -sha1 -verify key2.pub -signature file.txt.sig file.txt
Verified OK
Verified OK
In addition I created with them two valid self signed x509 certificates.
The key owners can claim the other one made the signature,
which appears crypto repudiation issue.
How to try the signatures in other scenarios?

Well, they are _distinct_, including congruence equivalence, but I have
other pairs with the same properties, so it is not the same key
definitely -- p_i and q_i are distinct primes and the rest parameters
too. I generated them with a proggie and checked, also with openssl -text.
Also the x509 self signed certs with the private keys work with
openssl s_client/s_server.

Posting the keys/certs/private keys, this is the README:
Distinct DSA keys produce valid single signature of single file
and the x509 certificates from the private keys work on openssl 1.0.2j
Tested on openssl 1.0.2j (latest and 1.0.1t latest) on Debian 8.
The keys (also private are attached).
Also at We got a triple of distinct DSA keys (key1,key2,key3) which
successfully verify a single signature of a single file.
By ``distinct" we count congruences, the p_i and q_i are distinct.
$ openssl dgst -sha1 -verify key1.pub -signature file.txt.sig2 file.txt ; openssl dgst -sha1 -verify key2.pub -signature file.txt.sig2 file.txt ;openssl dgst -sha1 -verify key3.pub -signature file.txt.sig2 file.txt
Verified OK
Verified OK
Verified OK
Slightly harder to reverse pair of keys with the same properties is
$ openssl dgst -sha1 -verify key3.pub -signature file.txt.sig3 file.txt ; openssl dgst -sha1 -verify key4.pub -signature file.txt.sig3 file.txt
Verified OK
Verified OK
To produce other signatures: choose a key from the two sets and do:
$openssl dgst -sign key1.priv -out file.txt.sig file.txt
Then verify, which may fail with probability about 1/2 for the first
set and about 8/9 for the second set because of the random DSA $k$.
Deterministic signatures are possible, but not possible with unpatched
For the x509 certs:
cert1 works always.
cert2 works with probability about 1/2, to check:
$ openssl s_server -accept 8080 -cert cert2 -key key2.priv  -www
$ openssl s_client -connect localhost:8080
For client lynx(1) works too, with innocent warning about self signed
and CN mismatch.
In case of error, repeat few times.
cert4 works with probability about 1/3.
Sketch of the numerology behind it.
For and overview of the simple DSA, check Wikipedia or better source.
The main idea is to use low multiplicative order of the generator $g$,
which is expected to be of multiplicative order $q$ (at least 160 bit)
prime modulo $p$.
The signature is (r,s), where for random $k$,
r=(g^k mod p) moq q
s=some function of x,k,r,MESSAGE
The public key is y=g^x mod p.
The signature is valid iff $r=v, v=g^f_1(r,s) y^f_2(r,s)=g^f_3(x,r,s)$
We choose $g_i$ of low multiplicative order modulo $p_i$, for (key3,key4)
it is $3$.
Whenever the "random" $k$ (for the first key of the pair)is multiple of $3$, r=1 mod p mod q
and $v=g^f_3_i(x_i,1,s_i)$. Since there are no congruence
obstructions, f_3_i(x_i,1,s_i) can both bi divisible by $3$,
giving $v_1=v_2=r=1$.
This is very easy to verify in a toy implementation or in python's
Choosing $g=1$ as in key1 works for all $p_i,q_i$ and the private
exponent $x$ doesn't matter.
Theoretically the keys are invalid, but the valid x509 certificates
working in |openssl s_client| and lynx suggest lack of key validation.

(EC)DSA partial knowledge of nonces and existential forgery with with structured nonces There are attacks against the private key of (EC)DSA when partial
knowledge of the nonces $k$ is known, e.g. least significant bits [1]
or shared bits [2].
On the other hand, existential forgery with structured nonces is
possible. In DSA the public key is (p,q,g,y=g^x). To forge a
signature (r,s) of integer $h$ for all integers a,b != 0 set:
r=(g^a y^b mod p) mod q
s=r/b mod q
h=a s mod q
Since y=g^x mod p, the unknown nonce is $k=a + b x$ where $x$ is the
private key. If $b=1, a=a'+2^l a''$ and we brute force the $l$ LSBs of
$x$, we can generate efficiently many messages with known LSBs (a' + (x
mod 2^l)), which appears in the favorable case the unconditional [1].
Similar existential forgery exists for ECDSA.
Forgeries were tested in practice.
Could this approach give subexponential algorithm for breaking the
private key, possibly under other assumptions?

Allegedly Steven Hawking said:
“I think computer viruses should count as life ... I think it says something
 about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. We've created life in our own image.”
On a cold sunny winter day a worm destroyed half of the computers.
It exploited few zero days in the BIOS remote management system which is OS agnostic.
By design the worm was destructive. It flashed all firmware it could and did
physical damage turning the device into unbootable “brick”. Wiped all data from
device's storage too.
If the worm could connect to the management port the device was essentially
owned. Antivirus warez didn't help since they didn't have a change to note
any “anomaly”.
The implications on the real world were severe. Severely malfunctioning
were shops, hospitals and a lot of other stuff.
Older generation worms like ILOVEYOU, WannaCry looked like wanted security
updates compared to the worm.
Some service providers were so little screwed up, if they wanted to be up, they
had to offer free services to all. Cynics joked this was the first real
beta testing of communism.
Crazy people claimed Pink Floyd predicted the mess around 1980 by singing

extremely difficult if possible at all.

They claim they can do 15K transactions per second and scale to Visa's
50K tps. The issue of trust is not clear to me.

Investors optimize profit, not moral values.
What is disadvantage to you well could be an advantage to an investor.
Current bitcoin (and likely almost all of the decentralized crowd) is
unusable on large scale.
Numbers taken from Ripple's site, could be biased:
BTC does 3 to 6 transactions per second, ETH 15 tps, XRP 1.5K tps (and
claims to scale to Visa's 50K tps).
Too bad the Bitcoin founding father(s) didn't think about this outcome
and code the solution.

AI in real world is for profit. They are relying on corrupt humans

expect the AI to be "nice" (not counting purely AI issues).
"dumb" Internet of Things is already enough of shit even without
"intelligence". This won't be Asimov's robots, more like "technological

Proof of the Riemann Hypothesis utilizing the theory of Alternative Facts
Donald J. Trump January 24, 2017
Conway’s powerful theory of Alternative Facts can render many difficult problems tractable. Here we demonstrate the power of AF to prove the Riemann Hypothesis, one of the most important unsolved problems in mathematics. We further suggest applications of AF to other challenging unsolved problems such as the zero-equals-one conjecture (which is also true) and the side-counting problem of the circle. We determine the circle to have exactly 11 unique sides

Consider the following generic factoring algorithm for factoring
$n$ which is divisible by $p$. Suppose you known an elliptic curve
in Weierstrass form with known multiple $m$ of the order of $E$ modulo
$p$. Let $\psi_n$ denote the $n$-th division polynomial of $E$.
Choose random integer $X$. If $X$ is the $x$ coordinate on $E$ modulo
then $\psi_m(X) \equiv 0 \pmod{p}$. If it is not, $\psi_m(X)$ need not
vanish modulo $p$. By selecting few random $X$ we probabilistically find
$p$ from $\gcd(n,\psi_m(X))$.
that if $p=27a^2+27a+7$ and $kronecker(2k^3,p)= -1$ then the order of
$y^2=x^3+2k^3$ is $p$. In this case $n$ is multiple of the order, so we
can use the above algorithm by trying in addition random $k$.
We found $200$ bit factor with pari/gp in just few seconds.

linux "cancer". Another example of anti-opensource behavior
are the Halloween documents [2] from 1998 (some current

It is well known that microsoft is entirely money driven
and she will sell Gates' first born and Ballmer might even
deliver it.
First, a hostile kernel contributor is danger for the
future of linux kernel IMHO.
Unpopular suggestion for microsoft's request for private
bugs: Find something that requires windows compatibility
(say Wine, some cloud shit, whatever else). Tell microsoft:
You want our bugs? We want your bugs. You show first.
Probably more realistic price to ask is opening patents/DRM stuff.

Since the office was established in 1789, 44 persons have served as
President of the United States. Of these, eight presidents have died

8/44 ~ 1/5 so about one in five US presidents dies in office.
In Bulgaria (Eastern Europe) there is another statistical trend.
Of the five Bulgarian Presidents since 1990 [2] two lost a child
while alive. (If you add T. Jivkov from socialism time they become three). So the probability of losing a child is 2/5 = 0.4
The conclusion is left as an exercise for the reader, because the
