I'm so pissed off about this idea... You mean like I'd be sued for using
your name in this email? What if my name was "Robert" - do we "share" the
loot when we sue the cypherpunks node owner for using our names? Yuck.
Ownership is irrelevant to information; bits aren't naturally scarce. [What
if I'm using the number "32", which just happens to be your age? Or "174"
which happens to be your weight? What does "any information about any
citizen" mean?]
