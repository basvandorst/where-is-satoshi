For those of us in the US (and I assume many of the more invasive
European countries too), purchasing cryptocurrency anonymously is
getting increasingly difficult. Most US based exchanges requires at
least some ID verification and things like LocalBitcoins are generally
much more expensive to trade using.
Does anyone know of a trustable, no-questions asked, darknet based
crypto exchange?

Key Findings
Non-State Actors Can Use VCs to Disrupt Sovereignty and Increase Political and/or Economic Power, but Unlikely to Use Established VC; Many Challenges Posed by Creation of VCs
- VC deployments are attractive in developing countries and in countries undergoing internal turmoil, where the existing financial infrastructure is either insufficient or weakened.
- The rapid deployment of a VC over a large geographic area would likely be less complicated than deploying more common currencies, such as those based on commodities or paper-based currencies.
- A non-state actor's VC (including Bitcoin-like currencies) would likely be vulnerable to cyber attack by a sophisticated adversary; more generally, creating new, usable yet reliable VC may pose great challenges, particularly for a non-state actor without technical sophistication.
- Promoting adoption of VCs among population is difficult due to newness, lack of legitimacy, and familiarity with physical tangibility of currency.
- Deployment of a VC by non-state actors, such terrorist organizations, insurgent groups, drug cartels, and other criminal organizations, would be easier if supported by a nation-state with advanced cyber expertise.
- Despite numerous hurdles, trends indicate a future in which VCs could be deployed by non-state actors or other organizations.

@_subject: BIP200 - Mandatory de-activation of forced segwit deployment 
This BIP supercedes BIP148 and outlines the methods and actions necessary to prevent unwanted network segmentation and forced isolation caused by non-consensual BIP148 and Segregated Witness deployment.
The Bitcoin protocol was initially designed as a decentralized standard. Unfortunately BIP148 establishes and assigns significant standards-implementation authority to large and more influential commercial organizations and away from independent parties. The author of this proposal fully rejects BIP148 as being contrary to the spirit of Bitcoin and rejects the premise that overall Bitcoin consensus can be gained through a simple voting mechanism.
BIP148 (UASF) additionally creates the scaffolding required for large influential groups to take ownership of the global Bitcoin protocol which is a significant departure from the original decentralized nature of Bitcoin. The presence of this scaffolding creates extraordinary risk of centralization within the Bitcoin community and must be resisted.
This BIP takes a red-team-centric approach and proposes multiple legally acceptable covert and overt means to resist and eradicate BIP148 and SegWit from the global Bitcoin network in the event it is non-consensually activated.

I haven't really figured it out and there's lots of idiocy going on. It seems the marketers have told all the employees and contractors in the Blockchain industry to claim they are all decentralists and cypherpunks. I've only been full-time in the Bitcoin space for a few months and I don't think many carry the appropriate vision of Bitcoin.
There's a great deal of commercial enterprises seeking to capitalize on Bitcoin. Segregated Witness is just another commercially produced protocol that allows functions to work at higher levels of abstraction. Think of going from BIOS to OS...
In itself it's not such a bad thing... but there's major repercussions. This can also allow them to backdoor the Bitcoin Proposal process and further build upon the layer 2 platform.
The way I view it is that these corporate fucks are attempting to privatizing a community resource. And they need to fuck off.

Currently none of the cryptocurrency networks in existence are end-to-end encrypted and I'm working on resolving that. I'm prepping for the day the great firewall of China sees cryptocurrency as a threat. This new platform will be built from Zclassic/Zcash and transmissions will be secured with zero-knowledge proofs.

@_subject: Governance vs Decentralised Systems, Gold, Cash, Bitcoin 
There's some really good points here. We've been exploring the styles of governance ourselves with the Zen project and we've unintentionally mirrored the founding of the United States (for better or less). After a period of private collaboration we decided to use a synergistic model using Core Officers which are elected to provide governance for the project and also to govern initiatives that the DAO has funded. This is matched with a DAO which provides funding for projects and ultimately decides on Core officers (and their fate). Instead of absolute stalemate as seen with Bitcoin & Bitcoin Unlimited, there are many ways both the Core and DAO could incentivize and also resist change if they were to become oppositional.
And let's not lost sight here that Satoshi himself could probably be identified as a benevolent dictator because he did indeed build a system nearly by himself and there are persons today that still try to carry out his will. In fact, some believe that any alteration that breaks the current Bitcoin model is only a corruption of the true spirit of Bitcoin.
All hail Satoshi.

Governance problems which have allowed skeptics in the media to
latch on to the failures of decentralised systems. Decentralisation
isn't a Boolean, it's a range. Is it much more decentralised than
anything we've built before, including its governance? Yes. You
will not notice that developers and miners really don't have control
to effect change until something goes wrong, until there's a highly
contentious issue. They may want to offer a straightforward, direct,
and simple solution, but the system won't let them do that. Lead
developers can make limited decisions about what they include in
the code, but with blockchains you can either have opinions or
continue to make money; if your opinions get too strong, you stop
making money. Governance in these systems is tricky because by
making those explicit trade-offs, we get liberty. If you want to
have quick / simple / easy solutions, you will elect a dictator.
The trains may run on time, but the destination might be a death
camp, an efficient operation for killing people. Democracy is
incredibly inefficient, but we practice it anyway because we
appreciate the trade-offs that it gives us: self-expression;
self-determination; freedom of association, of religion, of
consciousness. Governance in network-centric systems are open to
permissionless access and innovation, systems which exhibit a very
high degree of autonomy and censorship resistance. The price we pay
is that our debates are loud, messy, and sometimes don't end, because
there's no centralised authority to filter everyone's opinions;
that's how corporations and governments run. We've tried that, and
if we want that kind of money, we have that kind of money. The
bottom line is that this not an accident, it's an explicit trade-off:
efficiency is the price we pay to buy liberty. I will pay that price
because I can apply engineering optimisation to efficiency; Bitcoin
and Ethereum were the first times I could apply engineering
optimisation to liberty.

Currently as Bitcoin argues aspects of self-accumulation and distribution (the exact same issues fiat currencies face), other competitors have emerged. Many have began to realize the supply of internet money is endless and any project designed to capture more ground in the fight for digital self-determination is a righteous one.
With the hybridization of cooperative blockchain projects and digital mints it is possible to build completely autonomous economic systems. In the near future these independent blockchain systems will become interoperable resulting in the overall decline of traditional economic systems and non-cooperative blockchain systems (such as Bitcoin).
The ultimate success of these systems directly relies on the mutual usage and transfer of the token.
