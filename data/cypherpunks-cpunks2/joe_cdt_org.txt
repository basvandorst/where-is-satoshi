Two things seem particularly interesting: apparently zero requests for
content were fulfilled for Skype and the associated FAQ [1] says CALEA
(the US law that mandates intercept capability) does not apply to Skype.
That seems particularly encouraging to me.
The FAQ is also interesting in that the non-content question mentions
"location" but then only lists state, country and ZIP code as fields
provided (I don't know how MSFT would have access to precise
geolocation, but that doesn't appear to be something they provide). Also
the NSL reporting in the FAQ is binned in terms of thousands of NSLs...
so in 2009 they report receiving 0-999 NSLs and in 2010 1000-1999 NSLs
(hard to tell if that was just one more NSL or a bunch).
best, Joe
