Hi Ian,
Yea. That won't work at all, there's no clear authority [sic!] on who
can decide a CA is not trustworthy. Experience has to show that, and in
that case a lot of the big CAs will fail an evaluation. If you ask me,
it's pretty easy, my list of trusted CAs is empty. Automated generation
of lists of CAs that are simply unused is just the first step. I think
certificate-transparency is a good way to do that, the rest is basically
automation. For example: one can provide chef, puppet, ansible recipies
for linux and mac clients, a similar solution for windows and mobile
devices should also be doable.
