Black people in early America weren’t slaves. After this lawsuit, they were.
The only date definitely connected to John Casor’s life is this day in
1654 or 1655. It’s not when he was born, when he achieved something or
when he died. It’s when he became a slave.
Casor was originally an indentured servant, which meant he was
practically a slave in some senses. But what was bought or sold wasn’t
him, it was his contract of indenture, which obligated him to work for
its holder for the period it set. At the end of that time, indentured
servants—who could be of any race—were considered legally free and sent
out into the world.
This might sound like a rough deal, but indenture was how the British
colonizers who lived in what would later become the United States
managed to populate the land and get enough people to do the
back-breaking work of farming crops like tobacco in the South.
People who survived their period of indenture (many didn’t) went on to
live free lives in the colonies, often after receiving some kind of
small compensation like clothes, land or tools to help set them up.
That was the incentive that caused many poor whites to indenture
themselves and their families and move to the so-called New World. But
Africans who were indentured were often captured and brought over
against their will. That's what happened to the holder of Casor’s
indenture, Anthony Johnson. Johnson served out his contract and went on
to run his own tobacco farm and hold his own indentured servants, among
them Casor. At this time, the colony of Virginia had very few black
people in it: Johnson was one of the original 20.
After a disagreement about whether or not Casor's contract was lapsed, a
court ruled in favor of Johnson and Casor saw the status of his
indenture turn into slavery, where he—not his contract—was considered
property. Casor claimed that he had served his indenture of “seven or
Eight years” and seven more years on top of that. The court sided with
Johnson, who claimed that Casor was his slave for life.
So Casor became the first person to be arbitrarily declared a slave for
life in the U.S. (An earlier case had ended with a man named John Punch
being declared a slave for life as a punishment for trying to escape his
indentured servitude. His fellow escapees, who were white, were not
punished in this way.) Of course, as Wesleyan University notes, “the
Transatlantic slave trade from Africa to the Americas had been around
for over a century already, originating around 1500.” Slaves, usually
captured and sold by other African tribes, were transported across the
Atlantic to the Americas. Around 11 million people were transported from
1500 to 1850, mostly to Brazil and the Caribbean islands. If they
arrived in America, originally they became indentured servants; if they
arrived elsewhere, they became slaves.
Casor’s story is particularly grim in hindsight. His slip into slavery
would be followed by many, many other people of African descent who were
declared property in what became the United States. It was a watershed
moment in the history of institutional slavery.
“About seven years later, Virginia made this practice legal for
everyone, in 1661, by making it state law for any free white, black or
Indian to be able to own slaves, along with indentured servants,”. The
step from there to a racialized idea of slavery wasn’t a huge one, she
writes, and by the time Johnson died in 1670, his race was used to
justify giving his plantation to a white man rather than Johnson’s
children by his wife, Mary. He was “not a citizen of the colony,” a
judge ruled, because he was black.

Do you mean to say that, in America, the word "slavery" has a specific
legal meaning and, by definition, Indo-Europeans are not included in it ?
Pic related.
Indo-European slaves were sent to British territories in the Caribbean.
They were categorized as "indentured" workers and "servants" of the
English colonial elites.
For other words, Slave (slav).

They came as slaves; vast human cargo transported on tall British ships
bound for the Americas. They were shipped by the hundreds of thousands
and included men, women, and even the youngest of children.
Whenever they rebelled or even disobeyed an order, they were punished in
the harshest ways. Slave owners would hang their human property by their
hands and set their hands or feet on fire as one form of punishment.
They were burned alive and had their heads placed on pikes in the
marketplace as a warning to other captives.
The Irish slave trade began when 30,000 Irish prisoners were sold as
slaves to the New World. The King James I Proclamation of 1625 required
Irish political prisoners be sent overseas and sold to English settlers
in the West Indies. By the mid 1600s, the Irish were the main slaves
sold to Antigua and Montserrat. At that time, 70% of the total
population of Montserrat were Irish slaves.
Ireland quickly became the biggest source of human livestock for English
merchants. The majority of the early slaves to the New World were
actually white.
another 300,000 were sold as slaves. Ireland’s population fell from
about 1,500,000 to 600,000 in one single decade. Families were ripped
apart as the British did not allow Irish dads to take their wives and
children with them across the Atlantic. This led to a helpless
population of homeless women and children. Britain’s solution was to
auction them off as well.
During the 1650s, over 100,000 Irish children between the ages of 10 and
14 were taken from their parents and sold as slaves in the West Indies,
Virginia and New England. In this decade, 52,000 Irish (mostly women and
children) were sold to Barbados and Virginia. Another 30,000 Irish men
and women were also transported and sold to the highest bidder. In 1656,
Cromwell ordered that 2000 Irish children be taken to Jamaica and sold
as slaves to English settlers.
Many people today will avoid calling the Irish slaves what they truly
were: Slaves. They’ll come up with terms like “Indentured Servants” to
describe what occurred to the Irish. However, in most cases from the
17th and 18th centuries, Irish slaves were nothing more than human cattle.
As an example, the African slave trade was just beginning during this
same period. It is well recorded that African slaves, not tainted with
the stain of the hated Catholic theology and more expensive to purchase,
were often treated far better than their Irish counterparts.
African slaves were very expensive during the late 1600s (50 Sterling).
Irish slaves came cheap (no more than 5 Sterling). If a planter whipped
or branded or beat an Irish slave to death, it was never a crime. A
death was a monetary setback, but far cheaper than killing a more
expensive African. The English masters quickly began breeding the Irish
women for both their own personal pleasure and for greater profit.
Children of slaves were themselves slaves, which increased the size of
the master’s free workforce. Even if an Irish woman somehow obtained her
freedom, her kids would remain slaves of her master. Thus, Irish moms,
even with this new found emancipation, would seldom abandon their kids
and would remain in servitude.
In time, the English thought of a better way to use these women (in many
cases, girls as young as 12) to increase their market share: The
settlers began to breed Irish women and girls with African men to
produce slaves with a distinct complexion. These new “mulatto” slaves
brought a higher price than Irish livestock and, likewise, enabled the
settlers to save money rather than purchase new African slaves. This
practice of interbreeding Irish females with African men went on for
several decades and was so widespread that, in 1681, legislation was
passed "forbidding the practice of mating Irish slave women to African
slave men for the purpose of producing slaves for sale". In short, it
was stopped only because it interfered with the profits of a large slave
transport company.
England continued to ship tens of thousands of Irish slaves for more
than a century. Records state that, after the 1798 Irish Rebellion,
thousands of Irish slaves were sold to both America and Australia. There
were horrible abuses of both African and Irish captives. One British
ship even dumped 1,302 slaves into the Atlantic Ocean so that the crew
would have plenty of food to eat.
None of the Irish victims ever made it back to their homeland to
describe their ordeal. These are the lost slaves; the ones that time and
history books forgot. As if to (unlike the African one) have the Irish
story utterly and completely disappear as if it never happened.
