@_subject: Russia and China crack Snowden Cache 
1. Crypto is broken in the sense that entire notion of trusted computing is
massively broken and nation states can compromise end devices at scale and
access plain text via device compromise.
2. There was a period of time when the Snowden cache was controlled
primarily by journalists with limited organizational support. Many bad
things could have happened. It is still mysterious if they did.
3.It also seems likely that competing services had access to many of the
same documents as Snowden did. It seems reasonable to assume there were
more people exfiltrating docs for private benefit than for public benefit
on the top secret network.
4. What standard should organizations who handle secret information be held
to? The Intercept has hired some of top practitioners in the field. Is that
good enough? Less well funded institutions?
