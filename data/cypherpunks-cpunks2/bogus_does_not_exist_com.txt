Forwarded message:
Press Release.
Hyperion have been working with Mondex International to develop a
smartcard-based electronic cash service which will be launched in the UK in
Mondex has been invented as an alternative to cash.  At the heart of the
system is a plastic smart card which stores electronic cash value.  Mondex
customers will be able to use specially adapted NatWest and Midland cash
machines (ATMs) or a new generation of BT telephones to transfer cash between
their bank accounts and their cards.
Once funds have been transferred onto the customer's Mondex card it can be
used to make purchases up to the total cash value held on the card or to make
payments by telephone.  The card can be used to make purchases for large or
small amounts.
Mondex cards can be locked by the cardholder and unlocked by using a personal
code.  Once locked, the money in the card cannot be spent without re-keying
this personal code.  Shoppers will not need to sign anything when using the
card and there will be no need for authorisation calls; the customer's card is
inserted into the terminal and the value is instantly moved from the card to
the terminal.  With Mondex, retailers will not have to account to the bank for
each individual transaction; their electronic terminal will simply accumulate
the total value of Mondex transactions, which can be banked by telephone line
at any time.
Cardholders will be able to check how much cash they have left on their card
at ATMs, a new range of BT payphones and home phones or by using a small
key-ring sized personal reader.  A pocket-sized electronic wallet will show
cash available as well as providing a record of the last ten transactions.  It
can also be used for transferring money from one card to another or for
transferring cash into the wallet for safer-keeping at home.  The card is
designed to be used by children as young as 5.
In summary, among the benefits consumers will see are: 24-hour electronic cash
at Mondex phones which may be available at home, in shops or at work and a
convenient, simple to operate alternative to cash that is inherently safer to
carry.  Retailers and other cash handling business will benefit from an
efficient, faster, and more secure way of handling money that is economic to
In 1990, National Westminster needed a consultancy capable of translating
radical business ideas into reality.  They chose Hyperion.  We have provided
resources to assist in:
*       The development of requirements, functional specifications and
architectural specifications for a variety of services.
*       The development of software specifications for a large variety of
*       The management of software implementations, performed by developers
commissioned by National Westminster Bank.
*       The management of testing and integration activities, including the
development of rigorous test specifications derived from the structured
analysis and design of products.
Hyperion's considerable expertise in the practical analysis and specification
of highly secure financial systems is well known and this appointment has
confirmed their position as world leaders in electronic payment systems
consultancy, following on as it does from their work for organisations such as
the Bank of England, APACS and SWIFT.
Notes for Editors-Why is this interesting?
1.  This is believed to be the world's first implementation of general
purpose, person-to-person electronic money-a genuine replacement for notes and
2.  Since electronic money works over the telephone, for the first time in
history people can exchange cash without being in the same place at the same
3.  Recent figures show the cost to UK banks of moving cash around is
approximately 4.5Bn/annum.
4.  A senior NatWest executive predicted that in 10-15 years' time, the
telephone will be the dominant way in which electronic money is deposited and
5.  Analysts estimate that the service, if successful, will add around
100M/annum to BT revenues (The Times, 9th December 1993).
Notes for Editors-Mondex
Mondex International is a joint venture between National Westminster Bank (the
UK's largest retail bank) and Midland Bank (part of the Hong Kong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation).  They are working with BT in the UK to introduce
domestic service next year, beginning with a trial in Swindon.
National Westminster will be actively seeking banking partners worldwide to
establish Mondex as the basis for a global electronic cash payment scheme.
A number of international technology companies, including Dai Nippon Printing
Co. Ltd., Hitachi Limited, NCR, Panasonic (Matsushita Electric
Industrial/Matsushita Battery), Oki Electric Industry Company Limited, SPOM
Japan Co. Ltd., and Texas Instruments Limited are working with National
Westminster developing suitable components and equipment for the Mondex
The public launch of the service will take place in Swindon in 1995.  All
40,000 of the banks' customers will be eligible and the banks plan to have all
1,000 or so retailers in Swindon taking part.

The 'Mark of the Toad'.
That's what the Channel Government's news releases had called
his grandfather's tattoo when they had displayed it in 3D color
on GraphiCubes around the world. Jonathan's grandfather had the
tattoo done in an era when there was little danger associated
with being a member of the loosely-knit crypto-anarchists group
known as the CypherPunks.
Even after the beginning stages of InfoWar stirred its ugly head,
Jonathan's grandfather refused to have his tattoo removed, as
did most of the original CypherPunks list members. He considered
it a badge of honor. For Jonathan, however, the Mark of the Toad
had remained a mark of disgrace, forcing his family to flee for
their lives and change their identities.
Jonathan had managed to rise above all of this and put it behind
him, becoming a normal, accepted member of the society around
him. Now, however, his life of normality was being threatened.
The original home of the CypherPunks mailing list.
Jonathan had recognized the format of the message header immediately,
having seen many like it in his grandfather's study as a child.
Normally, only the Masters of Antiquity would be capable of discerning
this header to be from a bygone era when InterNet transmissions
were still carried largely over land-lines, but even they would
probably not recognize the significance of the date, which was
burned into Jonathan's mind from the countless hours he had spent
poring over CypherPunks messages that he had purloined from his
grandfather's hidden files.
January 19, 1997.
The beginning date of the 'moderation experiment' on the legendary
CypherPunks mailing list. The beginning probe in preparation for
the launching of InfoWar-an experiment which had failed miserably
and had caused a delay in the plans of the Evil One. A delay caused
by the damnable insolence of the terminal misfits among the CypherPunks.
An insolence that was rumored to be fueled by the Circle of Eunuchs,
fanning the 'flames' of dissent among the CypherPunks, helping
them to resist the herding of their list members into the group-mindset
desired by the Evil One.
Jonathan sat frozen in his seat, once again, his brain locked
from the major dichotomies being produced as a result of his present-in
which the CypherPunks were a villainous band of rogues who had
instigated the launching of Channel War II-and his past, in which
his grandfather had been exposed both as one of the major players
in both the launching of Channel War II, and as traitorous scum
who had sabotaged the goals of the CypherPunks in that same historical
Jonathan's grandfather wasn't just a CypherPunk. He was the Fool.

that he had subconsciously come to a decision. He would seek out

A. None but the polar bear. At least, such is the claim
of the experts.

"Of course!"
A Player To Be Named Later slapped his forehead, amazed that he
had not seen the connection sooner between the 'mass murderer,
serial killer stalking humans from the North' email, the Not-News
threat singling out "a billionaire to be named later,"
and the email sent to the Internet Content Coalition players just
before they held the meeting where they effectively folded their
hand in their attempt to take over control over defining what
was 'official' news on the InterNet, and what was not.
He reread, once again, the anonymous post sent just hours before
the Internet Content Coalition's grand agenda bit the dust:
"In July, Anson Ng, a reporter for the Financial Times
of London was shot and KILLED in Guatemala. He had reportedly been trying
to interview an American there named Jimmy Hughes, a one-time
director of security for the Cabazon Indian Reservation secret
"In April, a Philadelphia attorney named Dennis Eisman was
found DEAD, killed by a single bullet in his chest. According to a former
federal official who worked with Eisman, the attorney was found
dead in the parking lot where he had been due to meet with a woman
who had crucial evidence to share substantiating Riconosciuto's claims.
"Both Eisman's and Ng's deaths were declared 'suicides' by
"Fred Alvarez, a Cabazon tribal leader who was in vocal opposition
to the developments on the reservation, was found SHOT TO DEATH
WITH TWO FRIENDS in 1981. Their murder remains unsolved.
At last, the whole bizarre, implausible scenario finally came
together in A Player To Be Named Later's mind.
The Author's presence near the belly of the beast in Indio had
not been a mere coincidence. When the Internet Content Coalition
made their move, the Circle of Eunuchs already had the information
they needed to connect several of the players in the proposed
news cartel with the trail of deaths surrounding both those involved
in the INSLAW debacle and the reporters closing in on the real
story involved.
And they had made it more than plain that some of those involved
in the Wackenhut-Cabazon arms deals were now playing for the oppositionï¿½and
that bullets don't discriminate between the rich and the poor.
A Player To Be Named Later was still mystified as to how the Magic
Circle had been able to pull off such a bold, in-your-face maneuver
on some of the Titans of the news and computer industries.
In the early days, after the dissemination of "The Xenix
Chainsaw Massacre" had begun in 1989, the Circle of Eunuchs
had come under fierce attack from a variety of sources from within
the secret government hunting them. Mysterious deaths, established
careers going up in flames, overnight. The Magic Circle had quickly
disappeared far into the underground of computer society.
Then, the Circle had begun to show their hand, more and more,
now reaching the point where they could apparently do battle with
the heavyweights working behind the scenes with Gomez and the
Dark Allies. But A Player To Be Named Later hadn't seen any indication
that the Circle of Eunuchs had managed to gain possession of a
hole-card that could account forï¿½unlessï¿½
"Casolaro!" A Player To Be Named Later whispered,
as if speaking the name aloud might bring down fire from the heavens.
Quickly, he did a disk search for a vaguely remembered article
from Conspiracy Nationï¿½
Conspiracy Nation -- Vol. 3 Num.
("Quid coniuratio est?")
THE OCTOPUS
By Karen Bixman
(For The People *News Reporter*, 11/14/94)
On the morning of August 11, 1991, Danny Casolaro was found
dead in the bathroom of his hotel room at the Sheraton Hotel in Martinsburg, West Virginia. His wrists had been slashed ten times; his briefcase and notes were missing. The authorities labeled the death a suicide, and before Casolaro's family had
been contacted, the body was embalmed.
Damn! He had nailed it!
Karen Bixman's article had confirmed everything that A Player
To Be Named Later had increasingly suspected as his mind pored
over the mountain of information which had seemed so tentatively,
but treacherously, related.
Bixman had laid down an utterly astounding, twisted trail of closely
connected, mysterious deaths and blatant murders surrounding the
INSLAW and Iran-Contra misdeeds that completed the connections
between the past and current players in the battle for control
of world supremacy in computer information and communications.
What's more, the timing of the disappearance of Danny Casolaro's
extensive notes on the winding serpent of evil surrounding these
affairs coincided with the Magic Circle's unmistakable reentry
into manifest participation in the battle against the Evil One
and the Dark Forces under his command.
The Coupe de Gras, however, was the source of the Conspiracy Nation
Prairienet.org! From whence sprang the apparently unrelated Bureau42
clique who had seized the opportunity to host 'The True Story
of the InterNet' transcripts, despite the troubled and bloody
history of those who had done so in the past.
Bianca had mentioned to Mike Denney, at Basis Inc., that she had
been prepared to hack the Bureau42 servers when they came under
attack upon placing 'Part II' and 'Part III' on their system,
but that they had managed to clear up the problems that developed
on their own, and had done so in a surprisingly short period of
Only one thing was still bothering A Player To Be Named Later.
Microsoft had been the first member of the Internet Content Coalition
to publicly fold their hand in the battle to control news and
information ratings across the InterNet, but Gates seemed, on
the surface, to be less visibly connected to the extremely messy
past misconduct of the others, and thus seemed to have the least
to lose if the shit hit the fan.
Gate's quick concession to the veiled threats had definitely been
the catalyst in causing the hasty retreat of the other members
of the news cartel that had seemed to be on the drawing board
for quite some time in the plans of Gomez and the Dark Alliesï¿½but
Bill Gates had not become the richest and most overtly powerful
individual on the face of the earth by fighting against the grand
designs of the Evil One, but he seemed to be playing his cards
close to his chest, in a manner that suggested that he had an
agenda of his own that might not run exactly parallel to that
of the Dark Forces.
What was BillyG's game?
A Player To Be Named Later had been involved in the grand battle
taking place behind the scenes of everyday reality for long enough
to know that it was all done with mirrors.
"And each man, in his time, plays many parts." he
said, perplexed for the moment.
"To Shakespeare!" A Player To Be Named Later
said, lifting his glass in toast. "A member of the Magic
Circle, if there ever was one."
"If there ever was oneï¿½" he repeated, smiling
at his unintentional inside joke.
The Shadow was watching Bad BillyG closely, for any sign of subterfuge
in his inner demeanor.
"You're certain about Blanc Weber?" he asked,
once again.
"Well, I could be wrong, but we've investigated her thoroughly,
and every indication is that all that nonsense about her development
of the HydroCube is just that-nonsense."
BillyG shrugged his shoulders, apparently unconcerned with what
he regarded as a small, internal company matter.
"I could have her isolated, but I don't really see much
point. If she is hiding something, then it's probably better
not to let her know how closely she is being monitored. Perhaps
you should put some of the Dark Allies on her tail for a while,
in case there is something that my people have missed."
"No, I don't think that will be necessary." the
Shadow replied, casually.
He had instructed his men to monitor Blanc Weber's movements and
activities months ago, as well as those of the spooks Bad BillyG
had assigned to watch her. His own spooks had likewise turned
up nothing positive, but he had pressed the matter with Gates
in order to judge his reaction just the same.
"Well, her digital implant went according to plan,"
BillyG added, "so we will be able to yank her chain
on a moment's notice, if it becomes necessary to do so, in the
The "billionaire to be named later" sat back and allowed
himself to indulge in the luxury of looking forward to the moment
when A Player To Be Named Later would find out much, much more
than he really wanted to know about Bad BillyG's plans for the
tattered remnants of the Magic Circle who were attempting to interfere
with his own vision of the direction the future of the InterNet
should take at this nadir point in time, when the battle for control
of virtual reality was about to explode into every single facet
of human life
Bubba Rom Dos thought about the forefather of his technical namesake,
who had so far managed to walk with the Evil One as far as the
bridge in his rise to riches, fame and power a hundred years in
the past.
The Cowboy, Priscilla, Alexis, Jonathan, and d'Shauneaux were
likewise joined with him in contemplation of this paradoxical
figure from the past whose role in the great battle between the
Forces of Light and the Forces of Darkness had remained an enigma
throughout the history and legends of the Circle of Eunuchs.
Friend or foe, there was no denying that Billy the Kid was going
to play a major role in the direction that the thundering train
of history was about to take as it approached the crossroads of
destiny on its way to an ElectroMagnetic Future where freedom
would hinge on the free flow of Taoist bytes routing around the

had been carefully laying in place since the dawn of the Computer

i buy the argument that transaction instantaneity is a solution to the
identity theft problem - my cash in your hands, at the same time (now) as
your goods in my hands, in a way that allows both of us to ensure we have
got what we wanted.  But there's a trade-off; I have to use money, not
credit, now - your point about the buyer 'lending' the seller cash at 0%
interest.  I'm not sure how "the system compensates" for that.  It seems to
me it becomes a risk-cost trade-off for the individual: I can work out the
cost to me of using real money not credit; then I know what I am paying to
insure myself against identity theft.  Of course I probably rely on the
credit people covering me against a lot of the risk of identity theft, and
I may not even pay them for that cost (if it is built into the APR they
charge and I can avoid interest by paying off the card quickly)... so to me
identity theft risk is almost costless.  Why then would I choose to insure
myself explicitly by using cash instead of credit?
What is it that makes all the individuals start thinking about the best
interests of "the system" (which should be cheaper without all these hidden
insurance costs) instead of thinking about their own interests?!

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----

More like the straw that broke the camel's back, admittedly.
A long time ago I came to the conclusion that the closer we get to
transaction instantaneity, the less counterparty identity matters at
all. That is, the fastest transaction we can think of is a
cryptographically secure glop of bits that is issued by an entity who
is responsible for the integrity of the transaction and the quality
of assets that the bits represent. Blind signature notes work fine
for a first-order approximation. In other words, an internet bearer
In such a scenario, nobody *cares* who the counterparties are for two
reasons. The first reason is existential: title to the asset has
transferred instantaneously. There is *no* float. I have it now, so I
don't *care* who you were, because, well, it's *mine* now. :-).
Second, keeping an audit trail when the title is never in question
is, in the best circumstances superfluous and expensive, and, in the
worst, even dangerous for any of a number of security reasons,
depending on the color of your adversary's hat, or the color your
adversary thinks his hat is, or whatever. Keeping track of credit
card numbers in a database is an extant problem, for instance, with a
known, shall we say, market cost. We'll leave political seizure  and
other artifacts of totalitarianism to counted by the actuaries.
I'm walking out on a limb here, in light of what I said above, and
saying that when there's *any* float in the process, your liability
for identity theft increases with the float involved. Furthermore,
book-entry transactions *require* float, somewhere. They are
debt-dependent. Someone has to *borrow* money to effect a
transaction. (In a bearer transaction, the shoe's on the other foot,
the purchaser is *loaning* money, at zero interest, but that's what
the buyer wants so the system compensates accordingly, but that's
another story.) Because the purchaser has to borrow money to pay, and
because you *cannot* wring the float out of a transaction (that is,
you can get instantaneous execution, but the transaction clears and
settles at a later date; 90 days is the maximum float time for a
non-repudiated credit-card transaction, for instance), I claim that
book-entry transactions will *always* be liable for "identity" theft.
Put another way, remember Doug Barnes' famous quip that "and then you
go to jail" is not an acceptable error handling step for a
transnational internet transaction protocol.
I would claim that enforcement of identity as a legal concept costs
too much in the long run to be useful, and that the cheapest way to
avoid the whole problem is to go to systems which not only don't
require identity, but they don't even require book-entry *accounts*
at all to function at the user level.
Financial cryptography has had that technology for more than two
decades now, so long that the patent's about expired on it, if it
hasn't already.
See above. When you use book-entry transactions, by definition, you
need identity. Biometric, is-a-person,
go-to-jail-if-you-lie-about-a-book-entry identity. With bearer
transactions, digital/internet or otherwise, you don't have identity.
You don't *need* identity to execute, clear, and settle the
transaction, primarily because all three happen at once. There's no
float between the three activities. You don't have to send someone to
jail if they lie, because the transaction never executes in the first
place if they do.
Now, there are tradeoffs. The first one is key management, which as
Schneier likes to point out, is a hard problem. Personally, I think
that if you don't have to associate a key with a flesh-and-blood body
in meatspace, a whole continent full of problems just disappears. In
a bearer transaction, it's orthogonal to the issue of security
anyway, and all it does is cost you money to do for no added benefit.
The second one is security of the digital bearer notes and coins
themselves, which, frankly, scares people in the finance business
most of all. However, I would claim that all organizations, and even
people :-), do their *database* and document backups already, and
that proper system hygiene will evolve, particularly if literal money
is involved. Frankly, there already is a market for distributed data
storage, and there are even working systems using m-of-n distributed
data storage, which would be the most secure way to solve the
problem. And, as we all know, digital bearer transactions are the
best *way* to pay for those kinds of m-of-n services anyway, so it
feeds on itself nicely.
I think that it's less of a chicken-and-egg problem than it used to
be, and I think that reality is catching up to all the theory we've
kicked around on these lists for more than a decade now.  The
ultimate solution to the problem of identity theft is to not use
identity at all, and, frankly, not even to use book-entries at all.

This bill does three things of note:
1. It adds "U.S. Attorney" to the list of officials who can authorize warantless surveillance.
2. It expands the "emergency situation" rule beyond serious bodily injury/organized crime. I described this in my article:
3. It rewrites pen register/trap and trace law and moves it from the telephone world to explicitly cover computer networks as well, which would permit Carnivore's use under this section (when operated in trap-and-trace/pen-register mode). Here are some excerpts from the bill:
Now, whether all this is, as Stu blandly suggests, "a bit alarmist," is up to IPers to decide. But I think Senator Patrick Leahy, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee, put it well during the floor debate last night. Here's a quote from the Congressional Record.

This has been done before. A town in Georgia, one in Ohio or

t is just as unconstitutional to _require_ a gun as it is to _ban_ guns.
The crap about "conscientious objector" is just that, crap. I shouldn't
have to fill out some bullshit form to say I have conscientious
objections to having a gun in my house.
Government may no more require a gun in a house than it may require a
television, or a telephone, or a toothbrush.
Yes, I know the law is pure fluff, and hence is moot, a nullity, as
they say. But the principle of _requiring_ a  gun is just as foolish
as the notion of banning guns. Frankly, those who pass such laws need
killing just as much as the tens of thousands who are banning guns
need killing.

I don't think this is usually the case. Spammers who talk seem to
indicate that they get commissions, not per message fees. In my mind,
this means that lowering delivery is good, but an arms race. For some
spam, driving up costs may be a short term good, but a long term evil -
if the commission is based on inquiries to a mortage refinance broker, lots of phony addresses will make for an extremely unprofitable
campaign which they hopefully won't try again, but that also puts money in the pocket of a spammer.
Yes. I'm writing up a rant about spam, that I'll send to the list

(PAPD) Case Study: Jim Choate
Old-Subject: The Passive-Aggressive (Negativistic) Personality Disorder
(PAPD) Case Study: Jim Choate
Reply-To: cypherpunks at ssz.com
Sender: owner-cypherpunks at ssz.com
Choate replies:
Sunder continues, along with Choate's replies:
Essential Feature-
The passive-aggressive (negativistic) personality disorder is located in
Appendix B: "Criteria Sets and Axes Provided for Further Study" of the DSM-
IV.  Millon (1996, p. 198) proposes a comprehensive concept of a
personality.  He asserts that the negativistic personality reflects both
this general contrariness and disinclination to do as others wish but also
presents with a capricious impulsiveness, an irritable moodiness, and an
unaccommodating, fault-finding pessimism.
The DSM-IV (1994, p. 733) describes the PAPD essential feature as a
pattern of negativistic attitudes and passive resistance to demands for
adequate performance in social and occupational settings.
The subject, Choate, demonstrates these traits clearly, particularly in
the context of responses to otherwise reasonable requests from the
social group "cypherpunks" from which the above samples are taken.
The general criteria of a personality disorder coupled with at least five
of the following is sufficient to warrant a diagnosis of Passive-Aggressive
Personality Disorder: procrastination and delay in completing essential
tasks -- particularly those that others seek to have completed; unjustified
protests that others make unreasonable demands; sulkiness, irritability
or argumentativeness when asked to do something that the individual does
not want to do; unreasonable criticism or scorn for authority figures;
slow or poor work on unwanted tasks; obstruction of the efforts of others
even as these individuals fail to do their share of the work; and avoidance
of obligations by claiming to have forgotten them.
Examining the small sample above it is clear that Choate meets at least
of these subset criteria.  (This author has little doubt that a fifth will
quickly emerge with further study).   Procrastination and delay in
any of the tasks requested of him (the addition of more substantive
which accompany his rote contributions to the mailing list), unjustified
protests that others make unreasonable demands (in the case of Sunder
Choate's responses to Sunder's request for a more digest format illustrates
this), irritability or argumentativeness when asked to do something that
the individual does not want to do (while Choate could easily have ignored
the request, he chose instead to reply in an increasingly inflammatory and
argumentative tone), unreasonable criticism or scorn for authority figures
(as evidenced by material in his signature - "Legislators and Judges are
the pimps of modern American society.")
The passive-aggressive personality disorder was first introduced in a U.S.
War Department technical bulletin in 1945. The term was coined by wartime
psychiatrists who found themselves dealing with reluctant and uncooperative
soldiers who followed orders with chronic, veiled hostility and smoldering
resentment. Their style was a mixture of passive resistance and grumbling
compliance (Stone, 1993, p. 361).
Choate's response seems to mirror this type of response quite closely and
further study under the reference of Stone's work should be pursued.
The current criteria for the passive-aggressive personality disorder as
proposed by the Personality Disorders Work Group for the DSM-IV includes:
1. passive resistance to fulfilling social and occupational tasks through
procrastination and inefficiency;
2. complaints of being misunderstood, unappreciated, and victimized by
3. sullenness, irritability, and argumentativeness in response to
4. angry and pessimistic attitudes toward a variety of events;
5. unreasonable criticism and scorn toward those in authority;
6. envy and resentment toward those who are more fortunate;
7. self-definition as luckless in life and an inclination to whine and
about being jinxed;
8. alternating behavior between hostile assertion of personal autonomy and
dependent contrition (Millon & Radovanov, Livesley, ed., 1995, p. 321).
Millon suggests that the most essential features of PAPD are irritable
behavioral contrariness, obstructiveness, and sulking; discontented self-
image, e.g. feels unappreciated and misunderstood; deficient regulatory
control, i.e. poorly modulated emotional expression; and interpersonal
They are noted for their interpersonal conflict, verbal aggressiveness,
and manipulative behavior. Suicidal gestures and a lack of attention to
everyday responsibilities are common (Millon, 1996, p. 198).
Little study is needed to recognize the diagnosis as a strong one for the
subject Choate.
PAPD resistance to external demands is manifested in oppositional and
behaviors. These individuals resent having to conform to the standards set
by others. On the other hand, they fear direct confrontation. The
of resentment and fear leads to passive, provocative behavior (as in the
case of the subject Choate and Sunder exchange- wherein subject Choate
Sunder and seeks to create a situation in which Sunder will escalate the
Individuals with PAPD view themselves as self-sufficient but feel
to control and interference from others (Pretzer & Beck, Clarkin &
eds., 1996, p. 60). They believe that they are misunderstood and
a view that is exacerbated by the negative responses they receive from
others for their consistent defeatist stance. They expect the worst in
even situations that are going well, and are inclined toward anger and
irritability (Beck & Freeman, 1990, p. 339) (DSM-IV, 1994, p. 734).
Choate demonstrates this classically, particularly in the context of his
often sardonically defeatist and pessimistic inclusions in the titles of
Individuals with PAPD are often disgruntled and declare that they are not
treated as they should be. On the other hand, they are just as likely to
express feeling unworthy of good fortune. They have a basic conflict
their self-worth; they oscillate between self-loathing and entitlement or
moral superiority. Either side of this oscillation can be projected onto
the environment. The chaotic nature of this experience of self and others
often leads to people beginning to avoid or minimize contact with people
with PAPD out of self-protection (Richards, 1993, p. 259).
Individuals with PAPD see others as intrusive, demanding, interfering,
and dominating. They believe that other people interfere with their
They experience control by others as intolerable; they have to do things
their own way (Pretzer & Beck, Clarkin & Lenzenweger, eds., 1996, p. 60).
These individuals are determined that they will not be subject to the rules
of others (Beck & Freeman, 1990, p. 227). They resent, oppose, and resist
demands to meet expectations from others in a behavioral pattern seen in
both work and social settings (DSM-IV, 1994, p. 733). Their main coping
strategies are passive resistance, surface submissiveness, evasion, and
circumventing of rules (Pretzer & Beck, Clarkin & Lenzenweger, eds., 1996,
p. 60).
Individuals with passive-aggressive (negativistic) personality disorder
are ambivalent within their relationships and conflicted between their
needs and their desire for self-assertion. They waver between expressing
hostile defiance toward people they see as causing their problems and
to mollify these people by asking forgiveness or promising to do better
in the future (DSM-IV, 1994, p. 734).
These individuals are noted for the stormy nature of their interpersonal
relationships. They engage in a combination of quarrelsomeness and
Their affect is sullen and they engage in deliberate rudeness. They are

to the disorder is a pervasive pattern of argumentativeness and
behavior with defeatist and negative attitudes (Millon & Radovanov,
ed., 1995, p. 317). Richards (1993, p. 260) believes that PAPD may be the
most miserable personality disorder. These individuals inflict a great deal
of discomfort on others through the use of their anxiety and emotional
They can become so destructive in their attitudes and so unable to provide
rewards to others that they become socially isolated.
For individuals with PAPD, authority figures can become the focus of their
discontentment. They often criticize and voice hostility toward authority
figures with minimal provocation. Their resistance toward authority is
by procrastination, forgetfulness, stubbornness, and intentional
These individuals are also envious of and resentful toward peers who
or are viewed positively by authority figures (DSM-IV, 1994, pp. 733-734).
Authority figures are seen by individuals with passive-aggressive
personality disorder as arbitrary and unfair. When they are faced with the
consequences of not adequately meeting obligations, these individuals will
become angry at those in authority rather than seeing how their own
has contributed to the situation (Beck & Freeman, 1990, p. 339). Authority
figures are defined as intrusive, demanding, interfering, controlling, and
dominating. On the other hand, individuals with PAPD also see authority
figures as capable of being approving, accepting, and caring. A key issue
for individuals with PAPD is the desire to get benefits from authority
while exerting their freedom and autonomy (Beck & Freeman, 1990, p. 45).
The conflict is intense. Individuals with PAPD have a tendency to see any
form of power as inconsiderate and neglectful. They are also likely to
that authorities or caregivers are incompetent, unfair, and cruel.
these individuals are not inclined to rebel directly. They will agree to
comply with demands or suggestions but will often fail to perform (or they
will perform while experiencing increasing resentment). Then, when there
is trouble, these individuals will complain of unfair treatment. They envy
and resent others who manage authority situations and who are able to
to authorities with less difficulty. These individuals believe that their
suffering indicts the negligent caregiver or authority figure. They fear
control in any form but long for nurturing restitution from those they
as having power (Benjamin, 1993, p. 272).
Origins of PAPD in the Subject Choate-
Stone (1993, p. 361) suggests that the contrary, sulking, and verbal
behaviors of PAPD appear to have their origin in unending power struggles
with parents. The comparative helplessness of youth made it impossible to
win in these struggles so the face-saving technique of passive resistance
was employed. Parental overcontrol, neglect, or favoring of a sibling can
all contribute to the development of the silent protest and grudging
associated with PAPD (Stone, 1993, p. 361).
It is reasonable to assume that Subject Choate experienced some level of
paternal angst and the description of unending power struggles seems apt
in this context.
There are two major ways for individuals with PAPD to enter treatment. The
first, and most common, is externally leveraged treatment for those
who do not see themselves as having a problem. Someone forced them into
treatment, e.g., family, employers, or the legal system. These clients with
PAPD have minimal insight; they fail to admit that they are a major factor
in the problems they have. The second method for individuals with PAPD to
enter treatment is via self-referral for vague complaints, e.g. "I'm just
not getting anywhere" (Turkat, 1990, pp. 87-88).
All of the personality disorders are composed mostly of abrasive traits
that are negative in nature. Maladaptive traits are usually favored over
adaptive traits (though there are adaptive traits within all personality
disorders) (Kantor, 1992, p. 10). PAPD is a particularly abrasive
and interpersonal problems are readily identifiable. However, individuals
with PAPD do not frequently seek treatment for relationship issues as they
consistently blame others for the problems they have. Even if they do come
in for treatment for a marital or parent and child problem, they will
demand that the treatment providers "fix" the other person or persons who
are at fault for the problems within the relationship.
Treatment for individuals with PAPD involves openly exploring the ways they
indirectly and unassertively express aggression and neediness toward others
by being contrary. Understanding this aggression can allow discovery of
the depressive and invalidating experiences underneath -- which lead to
a fear of loss of autonomy when others want to be close and a fear of loss
of connectedness when others want to be alone (Kubacki & Smith, Retzlaff,
 ed., 1995, p. 175).
This author believes that Subject Choate is unlikely to seek treatment
and should be compelled to seek treatment in whatever fashion is most
to produce results.
Study continues...

A common countertransference issue with these clients is outrage or
anger. They are manipulative individuals who are consistently stubborn,
demanding, help-rejecting, critical, and inclined to ridicule both the
process and the service providers.  Subject Choate has predictably
in exactly this fashion to the onset of treatment.
Identify all avoidance and anxiety-arousing situations. Address these
with anxiety-management behavioral intervention techniques (Turkat, 1990,
 pp. 88-89). Cognitive therapy can help these individuals understand that
they expect the worst from others and then proceed to behave in such a way
that brings out the worst from these same people (Stone, 1993, p. 363).
Group therapy provides individuals with PAPD with an opportunity to learn
how to manage their hostility. When their hostility emerges, group leaders
can comment on hostile behavior and encourage other group members to
The group leader can assist these individuals to process what it is they
want or need at that moment and to rehearse appropriate behavior within
the group context (Ries, TIP  1994, p. 72).

NeuDist is an Open Source Software framework for building applications
for the Neubia Distributed Clearing Platform.
This release contains early java libraries and documentation that would
primarily be of interest to developers.
Talking about documentation, it is still a bit slim and mainly oriented
towards people with experience in Java/XML development.
There are currently no sample applications, but they will be available
in the next release.
The framework currently contains the following:
- Classes for creating "Named Objects", which are authenticated using
digital signatures within a hierarchy.
- Storage framework for "Named Objects".
- Simple XML-Signature implementation (Almost certainly not yet
interoperable with other implementations)
- Simple SOAP client
- Simple Servlet API for handling SOAP requests based on "Named
  Objects".
- Current types of "Named Objects" include:
    NameSpace objects -- for maintaining the NameSpace Authentication
 	Framework
    AuthenticationTickets -- for doing web site authentication using
Next major release is scheduled to contain:
 - Core:
 - Signing Services:
 - Example User Authentication Application
 - Example Payment System based on NeuDist
I will be expanding the documentation over the next few weeks. This will
cover not only more indepth technical documentation, but also higher
level documentation about the business side of things.

EO 13526 CLASSIFIED NATIONAL SECURITY INFORMATION AND IMPLEMENTING DIRECTIVE
PART 1. DESCRIPTION OF SELF-INSPECTION PROGRAM: A description of the
DoD Components self-
inspection program should include activities assessed, program areas
covered, and methodology
utilized. The description must demonstrate how the self-inspection
program provides the senior
agency official with the information necessary to assess the
effectiveness of the classified national
security information program within the individual Component
activities and the Component as a
whole. It should include the following:
1. Responsibility for the program:
(1) Whom does the senior agency official designate to assist in
directing and administering the self-inspection
Answer . The Director of Security and Counterintelligence (DOS&CI) is
provided a Letter of Instruction by the
Director, NRO which assigns his responsibilities.
(2) How is the program structured to provide the senior agency
official with the information necessary to assess the
agency's classified national security information program?
Answer: The DOS&CI advises the Senior Agency Official (SAO) when the
DOS&CI believes events warrant
advising the SAO. The NRO Integrated Security Assessment Program
(ISAP) results are also reported to the SAO
thru the annual Management Control Plan Statement of Assurance (MCPSOA).
(b)(3) 10 USC 424
(3) Who conducts the self-inspections?
Answer: NRO self-inspections are part of the NRO ISAP. Because
contractors make upgAof the total NRO
workforce and have the overwhelming number of Sensitive Compartmented
Information Facilities (SCIFs), ISAP is
a collaborative process between Government and industry to identifi ,
and address security vulnerabilities, provide
e tmcuriyseand.Th
may lead to identification and
definition of risk mitigation practices, and enable sharing of best
security practices across government and
industry. The primary purpose of the ISAP is to ensure the proper
safeguarding of classified information through a
single comprehensive review by various components of the Office of
Security and Counterintelligence (OS&CI).
ISAP integrates reviews utilizing program security, classification
management, transportation and transmission of
classified information, physical and technical accreditation,
information systems security, personnel security, and
Counterintelligence (CI) perspectives. The integrated assessment
evaluates implementation of and ensures
compliance with, established security policies, procedures, and plans
at all NRO government and contractor
Site personnel conduct/document security self-assessments per
requirements stated in the NRO Security Manual
(NSM). Security Officers will conduct self-assessments of their SCIFs
at least annually. For the reporting period
there were 343 site self-assessments. The ISAP Manager or designee
reviews the site assessments and enters a
copy into an NRO database listing each NRO sponsored facility.
Based on the self-assessments, the ISAP Manager, Program Security
Officers (PSOs) and stakeholders discuss
findings and formulate recommendations for a formal assessment, if
required OS&CI stakeholders represent the
major OS&CI divisions and program office security staffs, including,
but not limited to, PSOs, Physical/Technical
Certification Officers, and Security Certification Officers.
Stakeholders will develop and provide ISAP candidates
to the ISAP Selection Board. Each ISAP recommendation shall contain
detailed factors used to formulate the
recommendation. Recommendation for site visits is then provided to the
selection board Sites are selected based
on ring proximity, resources, budgetary constraints, time since last
assessment, and random sampling. A team
composition is proposed for each site visit and a Lead PSO is selected
The Assessment Team will, at a minimum,
consist of a Government PSO and an OS&Cl/Facilities and Information
Security Division (F&ISD) representative.
Additional team members will be added as needed based on site size,
mission, facility risk, and subject areas being
assessed. An out-briefing is provided to site security site - and
other site senior management identfying security
program successes, observations, and any security "best practices"
discovered during the formal assessment. The
results are then loaded into the facility database that contains
information from all previous visits with any problem
areas or "best practices" noted. A final report requiring corrective
actionsto be taken within 90 days of the date of

report is issued by the DOS&CI. The assessed site is required to
provide follow-up reports of corrective action to
the responsible PSO and the ISAP Manager every 90 days until all
corrective actions are complete. The
responsible PSO monitors all mitigation actions. Reports of corrective
action are loaded into the NRO facilities
database for historical purposes. For the reporting period, 16 formal
team assessments were performed An
additional 9 formal specific-issue reviews were conducted There were
an additional 1,491 visits by OS&CI
stakeholders to contractor SCIFs.
(4) How is the senior agency official involved in the program?
Answer: The DOS&CI keeps the SAO advised of trends and issues
developed by the ISAP. The NRO ISAP results
are also reported to the SAO thru the annual MCPSOA.
2. Approach:
(1) What means and methods are employed in conducting self-inspections?
Answer: For formal assessments, the Assessment Team evaluates
implementation, and ensures compliance with,
established NRO security policies, procedures, and plans.
(2) Are different types of self-inspections conducted? If so, describe
each of them.
Answer: Formal assessments will vary based on the experience of the
lead PSO and the stakeholders with the
facility and items noted in the self-evaluation report as well as the
areas of responsibility of the attending subject
matter experts. However, the objective for all is to identify and
address security vulnerabilities, provide data for
analysis, and identift system security issues and trends.
(3) Do the self-inspections evaluate adherence to the principles and
requirements of E.O. 13526 and its implementing
directive and the effectiveness of agency programs covering:
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Original classification?
Answer: Since Original Classification items only apply to 13
government employees who are Original
Classification Authorities (OCA) at NRO Headquarters, a formal tasking
is sent to Program Security Officers
supporting the OCA to determine the date the OCA received their annual
briefing and the number of original
classification decisions they made during the reporting period.
Experience has shown that not all of the OCAs
make individual OCA decisions every year but most require their
authority to sign classification guides for
their area of responsibility. For the reporting period there, nine OCA
decisions were made.
Derivative classification?
Answer: Included. In NRO Implementing Instructions released on 31 May
2011, derivative classifiers were
instructed to include in the classification block a personal
identification number rather than their name to
protect their identity and association with the NRO. This
"Classification ID (CLID)" number exists in the
NRO Access Database so the specific individual with that number can
always be identyled Employees of other
agencies, who already have an ID number assigned by their parent
agency, will use that number instead
Headquarters NRO derivative classifiers have their PSO available for
questions regarding classification and
marking and to review their derivatively classified documents for
format and accuracy of classffication and
marking. Available on the OS&CI website are the Order, Information
Security Oversight Office (IS00)
Implementing Directive and Marking booklet, videos and documents that
explain the correct way to classify
and mark documents, the Controlled Access Program Coordination Office
(CAPCO) register and manual, over
120 Frequently Asked Questions with answers that are posted about
portion marking a Security Policy hotline
that will answer their questions in real-time, and numerous other
experts who are available to answer their
questions. Once the document is distributed, they face additional
scrutiny from any security or classification
management officer who reads it or from subject matter experts who
point out classification and marking
errors to security officers.
The ISAP team visiting a site will review a sample of derivatively
classified documents to point out errors in
classification and marking, omissions of required information, and to
make suggestions for improvement.
Answer: The NRO has a formal declassification program which restricts
to one office the authority to officially
declassify NRO information and release it to the public, and which is
not included in the self-inspection
program. The results of this program are reported in the SF 311 report
provided to USD(I) in October 2012.

(4) Do the self-inspections include a review of relevant security
directives and instructions, as well as interviews with
producers and users of classified information?
Answer: All directives and instructions are issued by the DOS&Cl and
are reviewed and updated annually. All
directives and instructions are maintained on-line and are accessible
to all government employees and contractors.
(5) Do the self-inspections include reviews of representative samples
of your Component's original and derivative
classification actions?
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Do these reviews encompass all Component activities that generate
classified information?
Answer: There are hundreds of individual activities that can generate
classified information. While the annual
self-assessment questionnaire covers 343 of these activities, the ISAP
formal assessment inspects only a small
percentage of these activities yearly. However, the Program Security
Officers, Contractor Program Security
Officers, and Classification Specialists review hundreds of classified
documents yearly and provide direction to
originators to correct those that are improperly marked.
o How do you identify the activities to which this applies?
Answer: Site personnel conduct/document security self-assessments per
requirements stated in the NSM
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Do the reviews include a sampling of various types of classified
information in document and electronic
o How do you ensure that the materials reviewed provide a
representative sample of the Component's
classified information?
Answer: Documents are selected for review in cooperation with site
personnel who are familiar with the type
of materials produced by the site. However, contractors are not
required to count classified pages produced
because of the additional costs that would be incurred by the NRO, so
the documents reviewed may not be a
representative sample.
o How do you determine that the sample is proportionally sufficient to
enable a credible assessment of your
Component's classified product?
Answer: We do not attempt to do this as it would increase costs to the
NRO (as explained above).
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Who conducts the review of the classified products?
o Are they knowledgeable of the classification and marking
requirements of E.O. 13526 and its
implementing directive?
Answer: Yes
o Do they have access to pertinent security classification guides?
Answer: Yes
Ã¢â¬Â¢ Have appropriate personnel been designated to correct
misclassification actions? If so, identify.
Answer: All Program Security Officers and Classification Managemeni
Specialists are authorized to correct
misclassification, incorrect use of SCI channels, and incorrect
dissemination restrictions.
(1) How frequently are self-inspections conducted?
Answer: Annually.
(2) What factors were considered in establishing this time period?
Answer: Time period is defined in the NSM.

4. Coverage:
(1) How do you determine what program elements and Component
activities are covered by your self-inspection
Answer: Self-assessments are to be completed on each contractor SCIF.
(2) What Component activities are assessed?
Answer: All contractor activities are assessed.
(3) How is the program structured to assess individual Component
activities and the Component as a whole?
Answer: Contractor locations far outnumber government locations in the
NRO. Government locations are
relatively few in number and have professional government security
officers assigned who can monitor
safeguarding and classified information production and correct errors
as they occur. We chose to concentrate on
contractorfacilities which are visited relatively infrequently. The
conditions at contractor locations are not directly
applicable to government locations.
(4) If your Component has any special access programs (SAP), are
self-inspections of the SAP programs conducted
Answer: Most SAPs are reviewed as part of the ISAP program. The ISAP
formal assessment team has PSOs
assigned that are briefed for most SAPs. In addition. the NRO conducts
special annual reviews (in some cases.
semi-annual) of the entire Sensitive Activities portfolio.
Do the self-inspections confirm that the Component head or principal
deputy has reviewed each special access
program annually to determine if it continues to meet the requirements
of E.O. 13526?
Answer: The NRO's entire Sensitive Activities portfolio is reviewed
and briefed annually to the DNI's Senior
Review Group (SRG) who then reports to Congress.
Do the self-inspections determine if officers and employees are aware
of the prohibitions and sanctions for
creating or continuing a special access program contrary to the
requirements of E.O. 13526?
Answer: Yes. In keeping with E.O. 13526, all Sensitive Activities'
compartments that are established
terminated, or transitioned (to another program or lower
classification) require NRO Special Activities
Management Board review and approval, followed by notification to the
DNI's Senior Review
Group/Controlled Access Program Oversight Committee.
5. Reporting:
(1) What format for documenting self-inspections in your Component?
Answer: Self assessments are documented using the self-assessment
review tool in the NSM, Appendix B. For
formal assessments, an out-briefing is provided to site security staff
and other site senior management identi&ing
security program successes, observations, and any security "best
practices" discovered during the formal
assessment. The results are then loaded into the facility database
that contains information from all previous visits
with any problem areas or "best practices" noted A final report
requiring corrective actions to be taken within 90
days of the date of report is issued by the DOS&CI. The assessed site
is required to provide follow-up reports of
corrective action to the responsible PSO and the ISAP Manager every 90
days until all corrective actions are
complete. The responsible PSO monitors all mitigation actions. Reports
of corrective action are loaded into the
NRO facilities database for historical purposes.
(2) Who receives the reports?
Answer: The OS&CI ISAP Manager.
(3) Who compiles/analyzes the reports?
Answer: The ISAP Manager and the responsible PSO analyze the report.
How are the findings analyzed to determine if there are problems of a
systemic nature?
Answer: The ISAP Manager provides to the sponsoring Government Program
Security Officer (GPSO) for review
and subsequent action.
(5) How and when are the results of the self-inspections reported to
the senior agency official?
Answer: The DOS&CI determines when results warrant informing the SAO.
(6) How is it determined if corrective actions are required?
Answer: The GPSO and security stalceholder(s) review.

Public Key Infrastructure: An Artifact Ill-Fitted to the Needs of the
Information Society
It has been conventional wisdom that, for e-commerce to fulfill its
potential, each party to a transaction must be confident in the identity of
the others. Digital signature technology, based on public key cryptography,
has been claimed as the means whereby this can be achieved. Digital
signatures do little, however, unless a substantial infrastructure is in
place to provide a basis for believing that the signature means something
of significance to the relying party.
Conventional, hierarchical PKI, built around the ISO standard X.509, has
been, and will continue to be, a substantial failure. This paper examines
that form of PKI architecture, and concludes that it is a very poor fit to
the real needs of cyberspace participants. The reasons are its inherently
hierarchical and authoritarian nature, the unreasonable presumptions it
makes about the security of private keys, a range of other technical
defects, confusions about what it is that a certificate actually
authenticates, and its inherent privacy-invasiveness. Alternatives are

@_subject: Honeytrap reveals mass monitoring of downloaders (Paul Marks) 
Paul Marks, *New Scientist*, 4 Sep 2012, via Dave Farber's IP
Anyone who has downloaded pirated music, video or ebooks using a BitTorrent
client has probably had their IP address logged by copyright-enforcement
authorities within 3 hours of doing so. So say computer scientists who
placed a fake pirate server online - and very quickly found monitoring
systems checking out who was taking what from the servers.
The news comes from this week's SecureComm conference in Padua, Italy, where
computer security researcher Tom Chothia and his colleagues at the
University of Birmingham, UK, revealed they have discovered "massive
monitoring" of BitTorrent download sites, such as the PirateBay, has been
taking place for at least three years.
BitTorrent is a data distribution protocol that splits an uploaded digital
media file into many parts and shares it around a swarm of co-operating
servers. Birmingham's fake server acted like a part of a file-sharing swarm
and the connections made to it quickly revealed the presence of file-sharing
monitors run by "copyright enforcement organisations, security companies and
even government research labs". ...

[Disclaimer: I was involved with the Reason article. --Declan]
Putting 40,000 Readers, One by One, on a Cover
DAVID CARR
Published: April 5, 2004
When the 40,000 subscribers to Reason, the monthly libertarian magazine,
receive a copy of the June issue, they will see on the cover a satellite
photo of a neighborhood - their own neighborhood. And their house will
be graphically circled.
On one level, the project, sort of the ultimate in customized
publishing, is unsurprising: of course a magazine knows where its
subscribers live. But it is still a remarkable demonstration of the
growing number of ways databases can be harnessed. Apart from the cover
image, several advertisements are customized to reflect the recipient's
Nick Gillespie, editor in chief of Reason, said the magazine, with an
editorial mission of "Free Minds, Free Markets,'' used the stunt to
illustrate the cover article about the power and importance of
"Our story is man bites dog," Mr. Gillespie said. "Everybody, including
our magazine, has been harping on the erosion of privacy and the fears
of a database nation. It is a totally legit fear. But they make our
lives unbelievably easier as well, in terms of commercial transactions,
credit, you name it."
Rodger Cosgrove, president of Entremedia, a direct marketing firm and a
member of Reason's board, assisted in coming up with a program that
allows the subscriber list to be integrated with satellite photographs.
He also worked with Xeikon, the manufacturer of the printer that made
the endless customization possible.

July 17, 2001
Please Distribute Widely
Dear Colleagues,
The Narco Newsroom is now in New York City preparing for our hearing at the
New York State Supreme Court on Friday, July 20th, 9:30 a.m. in the Drug War
on Trial case.
Please attend Friday's hearing at the Courthouse at 71 Thomas Street,
Manhattan, New York (three blocks east of Foley Square), court room 205,
Justice Paula Omansky presiding.
We are also very grateful and pleased to announce that the Electronic
Frontier Foundation (EFF) has filed an amicus brief in support of our motion
to dismiss the Banamex lawsuit against the free Internet speech of Narco
Enclosed, please find a copy of EFF's press release of today. Please pass it

York metropolitan area, and invite them to attend Friday's hearing.
Immediately after Friday's hearing, in front of the Courthouse, we will hold

Bank Pres Drags Journalist into NY Court Over Drug Expose
Electronic Frontier Foundation Urges U.S. Court to Respect Mexican Rulings

New York - The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) today urged a New York
state court to respect Mexican court rulings that have disallowed lawsuits
against independent journalist Al Giordano for publishing allegations of
drug trafficking by Banco Nacional de Mexico President Roberto Hernandez
EFF seeks to protect the First Amendment rights of online, independent
journalists against the abusive "shopping" by large, powerful corporations
for favorable jurisdictions. The Mexican bank brought the case against a
Mexican-based website, produced solely by Giordano, the Narco News Bulletin:
"The EFF is concerned that the bank resorted to New York courts to try to
shut down this website because it could not do so in Mexican courts," said
Cindy Cohn, Legal Director for the EFF. "This kind of forum shopping
threatens to shut down one of the greatest benefits of the Internet --
giving a voice to independent, Internet-based journalists. Faced with having
to defend themselves in far-flung jurisdictions, many independent
journalists will simply choose not to publish on the Internet."
The case arises from allegations published on the the Narco News Bulletin
website that the bank president was involved in illegal activities in
Mexico. The EFF filed an amicus brief urging the New York court to rule that
it was improper for the bank to force Mr. Giordano into New York state court
for the statements posted on the website. The hearing on the case is set for
July 20, 2001.
Since April 18, 2000, Al Giordano has produced the Narco News Bulletin, an
online newspaper devoted to spirited investigative journalism on the
US-Latin America drug trade. Articles posted on the Narco News Bulletin
website have discussed allegations by others that Roberto Hernandez Ramirez,
the president of the Banco Nacional de Mexico, is involved in drug
trafficking. Some of these stories were reprinted articles from the Mexican
newspaper Por Esto!, published in Mexico by Mario Renato Menendez.
After failing three times to successfully sue Menendez in Mexico over the
allegations, Banco Nacional de Mexico now seeks to force Menendez and
Giordano to defend themselves in New York state court against the same basic
claims. The New York case groups together the allegations against the
Mexican-based website, hosted in Maryland, with statements made by Menendez
and Giordano in New York City on a radio broadcast and at a Columbia
University Law School conference.
The EFF amicus brief asked the Court to adopt one of two courses of action.
First, in order to deter abusive forum shopping, the EFF asked the court to
dismiss the case since Mexican law governs the dispute.
Alternatively, since Narconews.com mainly republished investigative work
done by others, the EFF asked the New York court to apply a distinct legal
standard for libel claims related to republished statements. The legal
standard requires that a republisher had, or should have had substantial
reasons to question the accuracy of the articles. EFF believes that this
higher liability standard for republishing on the Internet is necessary to
encourage the growth of Internet journalism.

June 17, 2001
Please Spread the Word
Dear Colleagues,
Just a quick note, as we race toward Friday's New York Supreme Court hearing
in the Drug War on Trial case, to let you know that:
- Two new legal briefs are now linked from page one:
(Joint memorandum by Narco News Bulletin and I, and my own sworn affidavit
about the latest court Exhibit, "The Mexico Papers" with lots of interesting
drug war facts)
- Tomorrow we shall post the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) amicus
brief in support of Narco News' motion to dismiss the Banamex lawsuit.
- At press time, we have heard of another amicus (friend-of-the-court) brief
being filed on our behalf, and as soon as we receive it, we will post and
announce it.
Apologies for being so brief about the briefs. For a pro se defendant, this
is worse than cramming for the bar exam.

I found the FTU's recent report on concealable weapons
( interesting,
but find that it omitted a few possibilities, viz:
1. The pop-top steel lid on a can e.g., of catfood forms a sharp
edge when removed.  (I have a permenant scar on a finger
attesting to this.)  If half the disc were grasped in a cloth
it could be more effective than several of the items you list.
2. Similarly, the steel lid on e.g., a tuna can forms a sharp (and
flatter, and slightly more rigid) edge when removed with a can opening
tool.  A can opening tool can be very small, e.g., the military-style
can openers, which by itself is not dangerous.  Again, any piece of cloth forms a graspable handle on the resulting sharp-edged disc.
3. Even a beverage can, e.g., from a beer purchased in flight, can be
ripped into a sharp edge, although the thinness of the (typically soft
aluminum) metal makes this less effective than the above.
4. The large knitting (crochet) needles which I believe
the TSA admits could be filed into a sharp point, producing
a spike as effective as some you list.  As these are typically
aluminum, abrading them into a point would not be difficult.
5. It is possible that a skilled knife maker could chip a glass
bottle into a knife while in the restroom, producing something
comparable to the obsidian knife you list.  The production process
might be noisy however, unlike the above.
Comment, which you will no doubt ignore:
Given the facility with which weapons are improvised or concealed,
it might be a better idea to stop motivating the
actors, as distasteful as that might be to some in power.
Although some will enjoy the Israel-like police
state that foreign entanglement will otherwise drag the US
into, and some -perhaps your- careers might even advance faster
under such conditions.
Have a nice day

The Word example actually has other worrying problems not mentioned. A Word
document contains a lot of hidden information, including other versions. It
would be quite easy to sign a Word document that, when you viewed it, looks
significantly different then it could be displayed without violating the
signature. This is due to numerous problems, the most basic of which is that
we often don't sign what we view but instead some binary that we _believe_
represents what we viewed but often does not. This is not just theoretical
nor esoteric, but quite easy as the Word example shows.
In effect we have absolutely no idea what we are signing most of the time
even without comprimise of keys, programs and all that good stuff.

It's still early in the game to be so certain. But if you are right,
that in it self is an indictment of PKI. If there really is a market
for trust establishment and a form of PKI is the low cost producer of
trust, then someone should be able to make money by using their
expertise to assemble a technology suite and sell trust insurance
based on the spread between the risk perceived by the market and what
they know to be a lower risk. If such services never develop, it
either means there is no market or PKI doesn't have enough economic
impact to cover the costs of starting such a business.

And the annoying thing about this is that once we go to
needing an online trusted third party to allow us to have
secure communications, we may as well chuck the public key
stuff and just use symmetric ciphers and the key exchange
protocols worked out ten or fifteen years ago.  Which makes
me suspect that we're just not using public key mechanisms
very intelligently yet.  We've realized that screws are
better for many jobs than nails, it's just that they're so
damned hard to hammer in....
