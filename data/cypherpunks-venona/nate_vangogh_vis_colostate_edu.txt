The root of this thread was a complete copy of a posting that I made to
the list, and mailed to L.Detweiler.  Is "The Executioner" on the list,
if not, this is a lot of evidence that he is L.Detweiler.
BTW, this really pissed me off.  He, The Executioner, could not even
come up with his/her own post, they just cut and pasted mine.
