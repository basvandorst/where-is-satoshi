@_subject: New key 
Mess-DOS struck again. My PGP directory got scrunged, so any servers and
individuals who may have added my PGP public key that I posted last month
have it wrong. My error.
Sorry about that. My *new* key, which can be easily identified as the
proper one by noting that my moribund psilink account is not on it, is
available via fingering me ajay
Listfolks please note and remove my old key. Again, sorry.
