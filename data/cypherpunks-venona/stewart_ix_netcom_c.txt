Excerpts from internet.cypherpunks: 7-Jun-96 Re: OECD   by Bill Stewart I believe the OECD meetings are closed to the public and journalists. I
was thinking of going to one, but was told that I couldn't. (Even though
I'm fully accredited with U.S. Congress-issued press identification.)
Isn't there an OECD meeting soon in Paris? Marc Rotenberg from EPIC has
been following this closely and would be a good person to ask.
(somewhat tipsy, always a bad idea when posting to cypherpunks)

Excerpts from internet.cypherpunks: 22-Jun-96 Re: FW: Bashing "Wired" by
Bill Stewart Bashing Wired is, in fact, a bit tired itself. I recommend checking out
 for one treatment.
Now I'm no fan of Katz's front-pager -- I thought it maundered about and
was twice as long as it needed to be. But folks who write for Wired like
Jim Warren, Brock Meeks, and Mike Godwin (and Katz) do hang out online,
basically know what's going on, and are approachable.
Somehow, I suspect that cypherpunks aren't Wired's target audience...
