I am not an expert in these matters, but one could argue that electronic
communications is a form of speech, and that the use of the internet is
an implementation mechanism of free speech that correlates to media such
as magazines and papers, etc.  Perhaps this is why the net as a form of
electronic commerce is giving global governments regulatory fits.  The
laws were written with regard to tangible forms of media versus media in
the electronic age.
I would recommend that a watchful eye be cast about to monitor any
attempts at changes to the items identified as "speech" in the USC
sections outlined above, especially given the recent judicial decision
regarding the illegality of ITAR with respect to cryptographic systems.
Perhaps a worthy endeavor is to attempt a modification to the Trading

I just got off the phone with DDJ - according to the sales person "the
editors are preparing a letter to explain the delay". Seems kind of strange that it is taking so long.  Of note - The sales
person indicated that there has been no mention of pulling the product.
