UNIX  and  DEC VMS Security Reviews
I would like to take this opportunity to tell you about two of our audit software tools, PCUA and PCDA.
PCUA and PCDA are PC based software tools designed to review the security of Unix or DEC computers using only the stand-alone PC in your office. There is no need for connections to the system, user-IDs or even a knowledge of computer security.  Simply obtain a copy (usually on a floppy disk) of key files from the system under review, load these onto your PC and let our tools do all the work.
These packages are ideal for use by auditors, security officers and computer system managers - anyone who takes computer security seriously.  The programs produce a wide variety of reports which show the findings, explain the implications of the problems and then make recommendations about how to improve security.  Reports range from a full, detailed report which is user-definable to a brief list of the problems found.
Both packages are evolving products and we continue to add new tests to them, as well as keeping up to date with the latest releases of the operating systems.  If you would like further tests added, we would be pleased to include these in our next release.
To obtain more information or  demonstration disks then please contact us.
Thank you for taking the time to look through this email.
