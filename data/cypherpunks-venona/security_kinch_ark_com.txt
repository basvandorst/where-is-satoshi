I missed nothing, I simply don't agree. It seems to me that the US
military is much more the agressor than the defender. Just who is it that
you are believe you are defending against? What year do you live in?
The military is NOT the defender of laws, that is the job for the civilian
police. Are you really that confused? I actually live in Canada where I
enjoy the same or more freedoms that you do, funny thing though, we don't
find it necessary to have a large military force to `protect' us. What the fuck is this? When did the play end on broadway, mid-seventies?
Do you have a point? I thought not. The only reason I pointed out that it
was the movie is because I am not certain that that line IS in the play.
You see I practice something called honesty, something you might do well
to learn about yourself.

It seems to me that any such scheme is doomed to failure, unless I
misunderstand what people are talking about here. While I believe that
there really is a `sucker born every minute', and it is that which makes
pyramid schemes work, I don't believe that too many people would jump on
board unless they see real, verifiable names linked with the schemes. Isn't it just common sense to say that if people are hiding their identity
while offering to `make money fast' then there is something seriously
shady going on? Aren't people *less* likely to join in under such
circumstances?  Sure, it allows such schemes to work in theory but in
practice, how do you get people to join in? Who would/how could you
*trust* such a scheme? Perhaps I give people too much credit? cheers, kinch

So, you send all of your snail mail on post cards do you? No
sealed envelopes at all? Afterall you have nothing to hide, right?
Of course not, privacy isn't about being a criminal, its about being
private. It is not akin to anonymity, *perhaps* those who work
anonymously have `something to hide' (still doesn't necessarily make
them a criminal, however), I'll let someone else field that as I feel
that anonymity is rarely a good thing. Privacy, on the other hand, simply means that not everything I do is any
of your business and I would just as soon you not be tempted to even
bother trying to find out. Of course, if all of your personal mail (including financial statements
etc) is sent on post cards, then (while I think you would be crazy) I
will at least admit you are consistent. Else, I think you need to look
hard at the logic you are using.

No kidding, thanks for that information. Perhaps you can explain how it
is relevant?
Another irrelevant and completely inaccurate point. I utilize free
speech everyday yet I manage to do it without anonymity. ha ha ha, not by anybody huh. What world do you live in? I know plenty
of people who feel that if you must say something anonymously `you must
be hiding something, probably a criminal!'. I don't subscribe to this, I
feel that most people who post anonymously are just chicken-shits, but
that too is besides the point. It *is* questioned by many people.
 And as to PGP not being safe, perhaps you could expand a bit on this,
it hasn't hurt me or anyone I know, seems pretty safe to me. To address
what I assume your point was, it acts as a prefectly good sealed
envelope (and I believe quite a bit more), in the context of my original
reply, this is quite `safe'.
Nor will you see my post-card that I send to my mom, how does that
change the nature of a post-card OR email?
Paranoid? No, but why make it easy for anyone to do so? so how is it different, besides being electronic, from snail mail? I
repeat, why don't you use post-cards exclusively for mail? Oh yes, that
is `print', a totally different thing, geesh.
You appear to be confused, I look at what I wrote and I see nothing at
all that mentions courts. I am talking about personal privacy and the
analogy is not at all inconsistent. (and paper mail is nothing but atoms
in it's ultimate form, so what?)
Why do you think there is something magical about `cyberspace'? Privacy
is privacy, period. Communication is communication, period. There is no
reason to differentiate private communication via print and private
communication via cyberspace. Both are desirable for exactly the same
reasons.  > Thats how it landed on my plate, thats where I send it back, seems
reasonable to me.

I told myself that I wouldn't do this but ....
But I wasn't talking about evidence in court, ALL I was talking about
was personal privacy in a (wasted) reply to aga's assertion that only
criminals would want to use PGP for email. I made the simple observation
that I think it is reasonable for me to not want others to read personal
(e)mail, period. Nothing about courts, law, free speech or anything
else. That was aga's straw-man, not mine.
On the contrary, nothing and nobody has stopped me (or you apparently) from speaking openly and freely. You are just being silly.
I didn't even say I opposed anonymity, I just find it distasteful.
[...] Well, in case you missed it, I was simply having fun with the word
`safe'. As I do not do things illegal and there is nothing in my
encrypted or non-encrypted mail that would get me into trouble, it is of
course perfectly `safe' even if the encryption were broken. Much more
than adequate for the `envelope' that I want it for. Blah blah blah, this is your argument not mine. I won't help you here.

I couldn't disagree more (not that I necessarily agree or disagree with
Adam's approach). Sure, once you have root you don't need any other
access, until the hole is found and closed that gave root in the first
place. After that, that /etc/shadow file with the lousy passwords (that
seem inevitable with folks using /etc/shadow as they get complacent
with a false sense of security) provide the would-be cracker with a set
of local accounts to (try to) break in again. Local accounts are
definitely an advantage should you be looking for way to break any Unix
The moral of the story is: ALWAYS ensure that whatever passwords you
have on your unix system are not beatable by crack, don't rely upon
hiding them because if you are wrong you are in it up to your neck!

Well, this certainly *IS* a different statement than I read from you
before. I don't find anything to disagree with here. Though, if your
passwords can't be cracked, what is the need for shadow passwords? It
simply introduces more variables and offers no more security.

Agreed, for a large number of users (say >1,000) it is quite difficult
for one thing, running crack can be too time consuming to be feasible. For a small number of users (many of the LANs I administer have less
than 30 users), however, it is not at all difficult. It helps, of
course, if you can trust your local users --- possible when there are
only a few and you know them all, impossible when there are many and
they are faceless. The less work I have to do to keep the systems/network secure, the more
time I can make available for *real* work on those system. Few sites can
afford a full-time security person, that is the reality that I live in
anyway. cheers, kinch

I don't know how much people get on welfare in your country but I
suspect that it is even less than in this country (Canada). Anyone who
truly believes that people make the `economic decision to do nothing and
go on welfare vs. going to work' has, in my opinion, no &^%* idea what
they are talking about. Just try to *live* on a welfare wage for a few
months to see how silly this thought is. While there may well be a few
`welfare-moms' (which is not necessarily a bad thing, taking care of
children is an investment for society), the vast majority of people on
welfare (at least here)  would *much* rather get a decent job and work
for their money. There are, perhaps, a few people who would rather not
work for minimum wage (who find it impossible to feed their family on
that) but I suspect that those folks are few and far between. But you claim to know the motives of those on welfare: pot->kettle->black
Just to be clear, I don't really agree with the original points being
made, but your views seem just as far off as the ones you are opposing, perhaps further. cheers, kinch

@_subject: Re: wealth and property rights 
I am not in a position to argue with you, I simply don't have the facts.
My question is, do You? can you cite where this figure came from, it
sounds like Republican rhetoric to me. Of course, I will point out, that
minimum wage is simply not enough to feed a family. It is (or at least
it should be) reserved for single folks just starting out. Sure you do: "economic decision to do nothing and go on welfare vs.
going to work". It seems to me that you are claiming their motives are
econmic, is there some other way we should read that sentence?
It takes an awful lot to prove a causal relationship, empirical evidence
notwithstanding. You haven't made your case, as far as I am concerned
(not that you need to convince me), there are a myriad of other factors
involved. I have no doubt that given two (or three) poor choices, most
will choose the lesser evil and that *may* mean choosing welfare over
working, but I seriously doubt that this is anything but a small
minority of the cases of people who are actually using the system.
You suggest that what ought to be done is give less welfare. If your
thesis is correct, I suggest that better paying jobs is the real answer
(assuming you agree that minimum wage is too little for most to live
on). Shrinking welfare payouts may serve to get people off welfare but
it won't make it any easier to live on low wages. We DO have a duty to
help our neighbours, do we not? Or has greed taken over entirely?
I repeat, however, I do not know enough about your system and I am going
to just shut up about it now.

You are clearly an angry young man. I am sorry you have such a poor
opinion of people, I am even more sorry if it is justified. You can
believe me or not, but what you describe is *not* the ordinary case in
this country. Of course, in this country we have a disgusting 10+%
unemployment rate. Even if people DO want to work, there are no jobs.
All that aside, I can tell you do not have a family if you thing that
$6.50/hr is a living! Even accounting for the difference in our dollar,
I would say that is barely subsistence income for a single person. Are
we *all* not worthy of more than that?

I won't argue with your figures, I don't believe them but lets use them
for arguments sake. UI (or is it EI now?) + welfare increase the
unemployment rate by a combined 3%, that still leaves (at least) 7+%
unemployed, a significant number! Meanwhile, major corporations who are
significantly adding to the unemployment rate themselves (heard of
`downsizing') are making record profits. That too must be the poor
people's fault, yes?
You have a right to be angry about CPP, it pisses me too for I know I

FWIW, I agree with you about the Unions (for the most part). Many have
lost sight of the reasons they were formed in the first place. The
leaders of those unions, at least the biggies, have become the monster

Last I heard, the CAW was still refusing to allow a vote. I would love

I hardly want to be known as the champion of welfare, despite my recent

result of health care benefits (presumedly) being paid for whereas
ordinary folk in the states do not get such access.
Assuming these figures are accurate, there does appear to be a problem!
While I do believe that most people would rather work than not, there
really should not be any financial incentive to chose welfare over
honest work. FWIW, I don't *believe* these figures are representative of
Canadian welfare roles as we all get (more or less) free health care to
begin with, something I and most Canadians are proud of.
