Actually it very well could of happened.  I am ex-Navy and for military
peronell it is made clear that anyone military or not that slanders,
degrades, or in any way threatens or degrades the President (commander in
chief) is subject to arrest, imprissionment and/or fines.  Of course this
usually doesnt happen cause only the real wacked out Clinton rules gov.
employees would enforce this.  But you never know!
