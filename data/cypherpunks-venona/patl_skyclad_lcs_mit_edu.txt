Careful here.  Deliberately or not, you are marginalizing the hard
work of dozens of people, including me.  You are suggesting our work
should have been done for Netscape instead, a program that a) is not
free software (FSF sense); b) has no mail reader; and c) has no
extension language.  Oh, and d) is horrendous as a news reader.
The packages that you implicitly denigrate provide far and away the
best interfaces to PGP available today.  They are written with the
tools available, whether it's a Windows shell, a hacked version of
Elm, or an Emacs Lisp package.
Maybe Netscape will include a mail reader someday.  Maybe Netscape
will include Java as an extension language someday.  But until that
day, the only people who can put crypto into Netscape are the folks at
Netscape Communications.

Netscape is not a platform.  It is a browser.  It is only useful for
viewing content that others have created, with a user interface that
any idiot can use.  Consequently, yes, it is very popular with the
masses and will become more so.

Can you name a platform for which it is possible to write a PGP front
end, but for which none has been written?  If it is ever feasible to
do what you suggest, someone will do it; your musings will have no
effect on that.  If you want to make a difference, try writing some
code yourself...

The problem is that existing operating environments do not, in
general, provide good facilities for the kind of tight integration you
really want.
Besides, there is nothing wrong with a monolithic application, as long
as it provides a sufficiently rich extension language.  Take Emacs,
for example.  Emacs is a monolithic application, but I use different
Lisp packages to read news, handle mail, and develop software.  (I
occasionally even just edit text.)
Moreover, I have co-authored a Lisp package to hook PGP functions into
*every* Emacs mail and news package, without ever talking to the
authors of those packages.  In general, any package can be written to
seamlessly integrate with any other.  In addition, all of these
packages work without modification on every variant of Unix, on VMS,
on Windows NT, and sometimes even on DOS.  I can write in beautiful
(and safe) Lisp, and let the Emacs maintainers worry about the
idiosynchracies of each operating system.
The problem with Netscape currently is that all of their packages are
*built in* by Netscape Communications.  That is why they have no mail
handler, and why their news reader sucks, and why it is impossible for
any of us to fix these things or add a PGP front end.
Java looks somewhat promising; with it, perhaps Netscape can become a
platform-independent system for writing packages to manipulate and
display hypertext.  It would be like an Emacs for hypertext, but with
a crufty extension syntax and no source code.  And a user base 1000
times as large...

 pfarrell> programs as its development vision for 2+ years, Macs have

These approaches suffer for two reasons.  First, it's a pain to
incorporate the same basic display code into every package.  Second,
it's a pain to rewrite the same basic display code for every window
system.  (Especially when "every window system" means Microsoft,
Macintosh, and X.)  Other subsystems than display have similar
problems (networking comes to mind), but I think display is the major
pain in the groin.
What Netscape could do is provide the engine for hypertext display,
with a sufficiently rich and simple extension language that it would
be easy to write new modules.  Someone would probably write a decent
news reader.  Someone else would write a mail handling package.
Someone else would write a PGP interface.  And so on.  Netscape would
need to provide other functions across platforms, like TCP sockets,
but that isn't impossible: Emacs has done all of this (save graphical
display) for over a decade.
Gosh, we might find ourselves using 1980 technology by the year 2000.
I don't know enough about Netscape's plans for using Java to know
whether any of this is likely to happen.  I'm not even sure I want to
see it happen.  But it would be interesting.

While I largely disagree with Dr. Cohen's conclusions, I do think we
should extinguish the "Examine the source!" mantra.
I find it surprising that people so familiar with public key
cryptography would be reassured by the argument, "Here, this algorithm
has been examined by thousands and nobody has found a trap door."
Public key cryptography demonstrates that it is possible, in
principle, to construct an algorithm with a trap door that nobody else
is *ever* going to find.  I wonder whether Rivest could construct a
hash function which only he could invert...  :-)
When an algorithm is essentially defined by a tangle of C code, like
the PGP random number generator, the "Examine the source!" mantra
becomes even more hollow.  Ironically, the fact that it was designed
by competent cryptographers potentially makes it even more dangerous.
Of course, there is no practical alternative at this time.  Maybe
someday your entire operating environment will be formally proven
correct, and the cryptographic algorithms will be provably as hard as
factoring, and factoring will be proven hard, and the system will ask
you to flip a coin and type "0" or "1" every time it needs a random
bit.  But until that day, you will have to decide whom to trust.
Personally, I trust the authors of PGP.  So do most of the people on
this list, I suspect.  Maybe Dr. Cohen can convince me that my trust
is misplaced; but to do so, he will need something better than NSA
conspiracy theories.

Check my phrasing again.  Note the use of "in principle".
Whether the principle applies in practice is certainly a matter for
debate.  I would point out that 1) PGP is hardly well written code,
and 2) many current cryptographic algorithms make ideal places for
concealing all sorts of things.

By "cleanly written code", I presume you mean code which is either
formally proven to be a correct implementation, or code which is so
transparent that it is "obviously" a correct implementation.  PGP's
random number generator is neither.
Moreover, as I precisely mentioned, the algorithms themselves can
conceal back doors.  This has plenty to do with public key
cryptography.  A reduction proof from a known hard problem would make
this virtually impossible, but there is no such proof for PGP's random
number generator.  (Nor for any other algorithm used by PGP, although
I admit RSA comes close.)

As I suggested, you could 1) only use algorithms which are provably as
hard to break as known hard problems, and 2) only use implementations
which are proven correct.  PGP does neither.  In addition, the
complexity of the source makes  difficult even to approximate.
Now, we could certainly take care of  fairly easily by using a
different set of algorithms.  And as you suggest,  can be
approximated if the code is written cleanly.  But this would be a big
project, and it would not be PGP.
I personally would find such a project pointless, since I trust PGP
enough for my needs.  The availability of the source is a necessary
prerequisite for that trust, but it is by no means convincing.

@_subject: ANNOUNCEMENT: Mailcrypt 3.3 for GNU Emacs 
Mailcrypt version 3.3 is now available.
Mailcrypt is an Emacs Lisp package which provides a simple interface
to message encryption with PGP.  (You do use Emacs to handle your mail
and news, right?)
Features: Encryption, decryption, signing, adding keys, extracting
keys, passphrase caching with timeout, multiple secret key (identity)
support, a simple but flexible interface to Cypherpunk remailers
(including chaining, response blocks, pseudonyms, and Mixmaster
support), and an automatic keyserver interface via HTTP.
*We* think it's the best interface to these functions anywhere, but
then again, we're biased.
The NEWS file is appended to this message.
Obtain it through the Mailcrypt home page at
or from the FTP mirror at
and enjoy!

Noteworty changes in Mailcrypt version 3.3:
Numerous minor bugs have been fixed.
Mailcrypt now requires at least FSF Emacs version 19.28 or XEmacs
version 19.12.  Sorry, but anything else is too annoying.
Support has been added for reading mail under (ding) GNUS.
Noteworthy changes in Mailcrypt version 3.2:
Mailcrypt now uses "start-process" instead of "call-process-region" to
run PGP; this uses a pipe instead of a temp file for various inputs,
including your passphrase.  Ahem.
All Mailcrypt commands now start with the prefix `C-c /' to bring
Mailcrypt into line with documented GNU standards.
`mc-insert-public-key' is now bound to `C-c / x' (an in "extract")
instead of `C-c a'.
`mc-deactivate-passwd' is bound to `C-c / f' (as in "forget").
`mc-read-mode' and `mc-write-mode' are now full-blown minor modes.  So
you can do, for example, `M-x mc-install-write-mode' from a Text mode
buffer and have the normal encryption and signing commands available.
The keymaps for the modes are configurable variables.
Interactive commands `mc-encrypt-region', `mc-sign-region', etc. are
now defined.
If you use RMAIL and you say no to "Replace encrypted message with
decrypted?", you will be dropped into RMAIL mode for viewing.
RMAIL summary mode is now supported.
Documentation in the form of a Texinfo file is now part of the
Mailcrypt can now fetch a needed key from finger, HTTP, or any of a
list of locally stored keyrings.  `C-c / k' initiates a fetch
manually; Mailcrypt will offer to initiate one automatically as
appropriate during encryption or signature verification.
The remailer functions now support Mixmaster.
`C-c / d' can handle conventionally encrypted messages.

Assuming Carl is using Mailcrypt under Emacs (as he suggests above),
then he doesn't have the same problem.  When the signature fails to
verify for lack of a key, Mailcrypt will parse the PGP output and
offer to fetch the needed key automatically (and instantly) via HTTP
to the keyservers.
But then, Emacs only runs on "ghettoized" operating systems like Unix,
VMS, OS/2, and Windows 95...

tcmay> As Bill Stewart correctly claimed is my view, the "key is the

These discussions are missing the entire point of the Web of Trust.
Key signatures exist for one reason and one reason only: To thwart
man-in-the-middle attacks.  Whether your "persistent persona" is a
True Name (tm) or a pseudonym is irrelevant.
Suppose a sysadmin on your site installed a filter on your mail and
news that translated everything between your real public key and one
of her choosing.  Such a transformation could be done automatically
quite easily.  How long before you would notice?  Depending on how
careful you are, it could take quite a while.
Key signatures avoid this attack.  What a key signature *means* is
that the signer is personally vouching that no such attack has taken
place.  Each signer has his own level of paranoia, and you need some
knowledge of that paranoia level to evaluate the worth of a signature.
Requiring a True Name backed by state-appoved photo ID is a pretty
high level of paranoia.  (It would take a lot of effort to monitor
this exchange, edit it to arrange a meeting between us, show up with
photo ID for "Tim May", and continue editing every time one of us
mentioned our personal meeting...)
Pseudonyms *do* pose a problem here.  The problem is not whether
someone tries to use a name that "really" belongs to someone else.
Who cares?  The problem is making sure that your conversation with the
entity at the other end of the wire is secure.
This is what the Web of Trust provides.  If I take the time to have a
long conversation with a pseudonym (so that I "get to know him"), then
I arrange a personal or telephone meeting, and the person I talk to is
totally consistent with the person I know electronically, then I can
feel safe signing his key.  ("The entity calling itself 'Patrick J.
LoPresti' asserts that the entity it knows as 'John Doe' uses this
public key.") Of course, I need to know him pretty well before I can
do this, lest the man-in-the-middle deceive us.  The beauty of the Web
of Trust is that once I have done this, everyone else who trusts me
can use the pseudo's key with confidence and without going through the
same trouble.
Zimmermann clearly understood all of this, but I don't think he
documented it properly.  In my opinion, everyone should always think
in terms of man-in-the-middle attacks when signing a public key.
Mandating "True Names" is just an overconservative approach suitable
for people who don't fully understand the issue.
