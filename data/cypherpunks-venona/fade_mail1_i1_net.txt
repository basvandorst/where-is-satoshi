@_subject: Adobe Acrobat encryption details 
Hi all,
I was hoping someone might be able to point me to details on .PDF file
encryption.  I'm specifically interested in key-generation (which hash is
used?) and if there is consistant known-plaintext in .PDF file headers.
I've searched around, and all I can find is that Acrobat uses rc4, which
isn't very helpful...

Thanks to the people who responded, with their help, I was able to find a
very excellent page about the topic, which I thought I'd post here for
anyone else who might be interested.

@_subject: "Unbreakable Crypto" announcement?? 
Does anyone with access to the Financial Times know what the hell this
snippet is talking about??
ENCRYPTION BREAKTHROUGH ANNOUNCED TODAY
August 24, 1998
     According to the Financial Times a new "unbreakable" encryption
technology, called the "Cramer-Shoup cryptosystem," will be annouced today
by mathematicians from the International Federal Institute of Technology
which supposedly will thwart even the most aggressive Internet hackers.
They claim to have created the first "unbreakable protection" which would
reportedly be a breakthrough that could ensure the security of electronic
commerce. The Financial Times said, "The breakthrough comes amid growing
anxiety about the vulnerability of Internet transactions since the discovery by researchers earlier this year of a new way to break through
even the strongest encryption systems."
