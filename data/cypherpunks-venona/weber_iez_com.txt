no, "radikal" isn't a terrorist magazine.
it's just ridiculous kiddy stuff.

i absolutely agree with what you said, but let me correct
this misunderstanding:
it was *not* the german government, it was the public prosecutor
general, who pushed this blockage.
the german government recently said, that ISPs shouldn't (and aren't!)
be responsible for what they're transmitting.
but like other democratic states, in germany the public prosecutor
is independant from government...

i got a lot of replies to this. :-)
i did translate "government" word for word, but it's written
more in the meaning of "state".
and in this meaning, it's surely the right word.

how could you define childish?
i did read 'radical'.
my impression was that's childish, but don't ask from me to
start a discussion about it.
perhaps they translate it to english, so you can see by yourself.
that's the idea of free speech.

there was action.
press relaeses were published, and the public prosecuter general
has been informed about the technical background.
latest news say that german providers stopped the blockage.
i'm awaiting what happens after restoration of 'radical 154'. :-)
