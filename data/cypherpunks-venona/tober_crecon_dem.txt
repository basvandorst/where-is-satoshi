Bruce Tober is a generally good guy, but on copyright issues he's a
one-man net-police-bureau, filtering through various mailing lists for
suspected violations.
Bruce has a history of calling those whom he suspects misuse copyrighted
materials "copyright thieves" -- a term that I love, since it's so close
to the Church of Scientology's label of "copyright terrorists."
