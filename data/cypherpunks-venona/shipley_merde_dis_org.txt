  Subject: Digital Signature Scandal
  Organization: Free Software Foundation, 675 Mass Ave. Cambridge, MA 02139
[The following is an official announcement from the League for Programming
Freedom.  Please redistribute this as widely as possible.  [NF]]
                   Digital Signature Scandal
Digital signature is a technique whereby one person (call her J. R. Gensym)
can produce a specially encrypted number which anyone can verify could only
have been produced by her.  (Typically a particular signature number encodes
additional information such as a date and time or a legal document being
signed.)  Anyone can decrypt the number because that can be done with
information that is published; but producing such a number uses a "key" (a
password) that J. R. Gensym does not tell to anyone else.
Several years ago, Congress directed the NIST (National Institute of Standards
and Technology, formerly the National Bureau of Standards) to choose a single
digital signature algorithm as a standard for the US.
In 1992, two algorithms were under consideration.  One had been
developed by NIST with advice from the NSA (National Security Agency),
which engages in electronic spying and decoding.  There was widespread
suspicion that this algorithm had been designed to facilitate some
sort of trickery.
The fact that NIST had applied for a patent on this algorithm engendered
additional suspicion; despite their assurances that this would not be used to
interfere with use of the technique, people could imagine no harmless motive
for patenting it.
The other algorithm was proposed by a company called PKP, Inc., which not
coincidentally has patents covering its use.  This alternative had a
disadvantage that was not just speculation: if this algorithm were adopted as
the standard, everyone using the standard would have to pay PKP.
(The same patents cover the broader field of public key cryptography,
a technique whose use in the US has been mostly inhibited for a decade
by PKP's assiduous enforcement of these patents.  The patents were
licensed exclusively to PKP by the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and Stanford University, and derive from taxpayer-funded
PKP, Inc. made much of the suspect nature of the NIST algorithm and
portrayed itself as warning the public about this.
On June 8, NIST published a new plan which combines the worst of both
worlds: to adopt the suspect NIST algorithm, and give PKP, Inc. an
*exclusive* license to the patent for it.  This plan places digital
signature use under the control of PKP through the year 2010.
By agreeing to this arrangement, PKP, Inc. shows that its concern to protect
the public from possible trickery was a sham.  Its real desire was, as one
might have guessed, to own an official national standard.  Meanwhile, NIST has
justified past suspicion about its patent application by proposing to give
that patent (in effect) to a private entity.
Instead of making a gift to PKP, Inc., of the work all of us have paid for,
NIST and Congress ought to protect our access to it--by pursuing all possible
means, judicial and legislative, to invalidate or annul the PKP patents.  If
that fails, even taking them by eminent domain is better (and cheaper in the
long run!) than the current plan.
You can write to NIST to object to this giveaway.  Write to:

           58, No. 108, dated June 8, 1993 under Notices **
National Institute of Standards and Technology
Notice of Proposal for Grant of Exclusive Patent License
This is to notify the public that the National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST) intends to grant an exclusive world-wide license to Public
Key Partners of Sunnyvale, California to practice the Invention embodied in
U.S. Patent Application No.  07/738.431 and entitled "Digital Signature
Algorithm."  A PCT application has been filed.  The rights in the invention
have been assigned to the United States of America.
The prospective license is a cross-license which would resolve a patent
dispute with Public Key Partners and includes the right to sublicense.  Notice
of availability of this invention for licensing was waived because it was
determined that expeditious granting of such license will best serve the
interest of the Federal Government and the public.  Public Key Partners has
provided NIST with the materials contained in Appendix A as part of their
proposal to NIST.
Inquiries, comments, and other materials relating to the prospective license
shall be submitted to Michael R. Rubin, Active Chief Counsel for Technology,
Room A-1111, Administration Building, National Institute of Standards and
Technology, Gaithersburg, Maryland 20899.  His telephone number is (301)
975-2803.  Applications for a license filed in response to this notice will be
treated as objections to the grant of the prospective license.  Only written
comments and/or applications for a license which are received by NIST within
sixty (60) days for the publication of this notice will be considered.
The prospective license will be granted unless, within sixty (60) days of this
notice, NIST receives written evidence and argument which established that the
grant of the license would not be consistent with the requirements of 35
U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7.
  Dated:  June 2, 1993.

Acting Director, National Institute Standards and Technology.
Appendix "A"
The National Institute for Standards and Technology ("NIST") has announced its
intention to grant Public Key Partners ("PKP") sublicensing rights to NIST's
pending patent application on the Digital Signature Algorithm ("DSA").
Subject to NIST's grant of this license, PKP is pleased to declare its support
for the proposed Federal Information Processing Standard for Digital
Signatures (the "DSS") and the pending availability of licenses to practice
the DSA.  In addition to the DSA, licenses to practice digital signatures will
be offered by PKP under the following patents:
          Cryptographic Apparatus and Method ("Diffie-Hellman")
                No. 4,200,770
          Public Key Cryptographic Apparatus and Method
                ("Hellman-Merkle")   No. 4,315,552
          Exponential Cryptographic Apparatus and Method
                ("Hellman-Pohlig")   No. 4,434,414
          Method For Identifying Subscribers And For Generating
                And Verifying Electronic Signatures In A Data Exchange
                System ("Schnorr")   No. 4,995,082
It is PKP's intent to make practice of the DSA royalty free for personal,
noncommercial and U.S. Federal, state and local government use.  As explained
below, only those parties who enjoy commercial benefit from making or selling
products, or certifying digital signatures, will be required to pay royalties
to practice the DSA.
PKP will also grant a license to practice key management, at no additional
fee, for the integrated circuits which will implement both the DSA and the
anticipated Federal Information Processing Standard for the "key escrow"
system announced by President Clinton on April 16, 1993.
Having stated these intentions, PKP now takes this opportunity to publish its
guidelines for granting uniform licenses to all parties having a commercial
interest in practicing this technology:
First, no party will be denied a license for any reason other that the
          (i)    Failure to meet its payment obligations,
          (ii)   Outstanding claims of infringement, or
          (iii)  Previous termination due to material breach.
Second, licenses will be granted for any embodiment sold by the licensee or
made for its use, whether for final products software, or components such as
integrated circuits and boards, and regardless of the licensee's channel of
distribution.  Provided the requisite royalties have been paid by the seller
on the enabling component(s), no further royalties will be owned by the buyer

Third, the practice of digital signatures in accordance with the DSS may be
licensed separately from any other technical art covered by PKP's patents.

Yea right!  have you ever noticed the about of physical abuse the phone take

especialy when they have to repair/replace the phones every other week.
(note at we all know these phone are bulletproof, they are not broken/smashed

A NEW WORLD RECORD IN PASSWORD CHECKING HAS BEEN SET:

Roch Bourbonnais, a Thinking Machines Corporation engineer, has ported
and optimized the CM/2 port of the UFC-crypt to a CM/5 system.
The UFC-crypt (Ultra Fast Crypt) implementation on the CM/2 Connection
Machine (parallel computer) is a UNIX password checking routine (crypt())
ported by Michael Glad at UNI-C.
The port, that is written in CM-fortran, utilizes the CM/5 vector units
and is partly programmed in cdpeac (vector unit assembly language).
The package achieves 1560 encryptions/second/vector unit. This scales to
    6,4 million encryptions per second on a large  1024 node machine.
    800,000          -       -     -    - - small   128  -      -
With this impressive performance, all combinations of 6 letters can be
tried in less than an hour and all combinations of 6 lower-case letters
can be tried in less than one minute.

Today I ran into a situation that made me completely nausiated and feel like
my privacy had been completely invaded... It involves a chip which is implanted in animals and used for identification... Prehaps I over-reacted but my gut tells me that I haven't. That's what makes me still feel nausiated when I think about it. So I thought I would see what you thought about it.
My housemate and I are looking to get some cats for our house. We decided to
go to the Peninsula Humane Society (in the south San Francisco area) and see about adopting them from there as this is where lost or stray animals are kept and if unclaimed after a month, are put to sleep.
I fell in-love with a beautiful black simi-long hair cat named "Hawk", a five
year old male with yellow eyes.  We got along really well (I am a cat person by nature) and I decided to adopt him. He is very gental and loving which seems so strange for such a big male cat. I kept calling him "she" :).
So, I went to the front desk and spoke with the Animal Coordinator/Advisor.
Everything was going great and they were impressed that my dad's a veterinarian.
Said it sounded like we could provide Hawk with a wonderful home. Then the
woman said, "All we have to do is implant a microchip in the animal and you'll
be set". Well, I turned pale and said, "What's this chip and why is it needed?"
I was told that it was used to identify the animal in case it became lost. A
identifaction number is stored on this microchip and can be used to find
the pet's owner and home.
Well, I said I didn't want a chip in this cat and that it was a violation of privacy. There was a woman standing next to me, awaiting getting her pet, and she turned to me and said, "I don't see what the problem is?" I responded,
"Well, if their doing this to animals, how soon will it be before they implant the same sort of thing in us?" She said, "Oh, I hadn't thought about
it like that." and became quiet. I told the attendant that I was strongly
opposed to this chip implant and couldn't accept the cat with it. So she is
going to check with her boss tomorrow to see if I can get the cat without the chip. She said she understood my concerns about big brother and that a few people have had similar reactions.  I'll send you an update tomorrow and let you know if I can get the cat without the chip... I was really upset about this. My housemate asked me why and I said, "It's too
close. Don't forget that we are animals too! We can't really talk til we're
2 so I could see this I.D. microchip being used in human babies. And what
about people who might suffer from memory loss? A reason to use a chip in
adults would be to "identify" you if you forgot who you were or if you were
not using your born identity. The possiblities are endless!" And with the
NII coming, well it's as bad as the clipper chip, if not worse!
So, am I totally over-reacting? I really do feel like this chip is wrong and
don't know what to do...
Below is the brocure contents about the C.H.I.P. program. How do you feel about it?

Seventy percent of missing animals never come home because they have no permanent I.D. or their owners don't know how to find them. Here at PHS, only 3% of the stray cats and 57% of the stray dogs brought to the shelter ever return to their family.
Because you care about your animals, your home is as secure as possible. But thefts, accidents and natural desasters such as fires and earthquakes, do happen - even to caring and responsible pet owners like you. Despite your best efforts, your animal could get loose and become lost.
That's why your newly adopted friend has become part of our new Campaign to Help Identify Pets (CHIP).
PHS is working in conjunction with InfoPet, maker of computerized identification
microchips, to expand our lost and found services. With the new microchip implant program, we hope to reunite as many animals as possible with their High-Tech Identification:

What's this?  This is an updated announcement and invitation to DEF CON II,
a convention for the "underground" elements of the computer culture.  We try
to target the (Fill in your favorite word here): Hackers, Phreaks, Hammies,
Virii Coders, Programmers, Crackers, Cyberpunk Wannabees, Civil Liberties
Groups, CypherPunks, Futurists, Artists, Etc..
WHO:   You know who you are, you shady characters.
WHAT:  A convention for you to meet, party, and listen to some speeches
       that you would normally never hear.
WHEN:  July 22, 23, 24 - 1994 (Speaking on the 23rd and 24th)
WHERE: Las Vegas, Nevada @ The Sahara Hotel
So you heard about DEF CON I, and want to hit part II?  You heard about the
parties, the info discussed, the bizarre atmosphere of Las Vegas and want to
check it out in person?  Load up your laptop muffy, we're heading to Vegas!
Here is what Three out of Three people said about last years convention:
"DEF CON I, last week in Las Vegas, was both the strangest and the best
computer event I have attended in years." -- Robert X. Cringely, Info World
"Toto, I don't think we're at COMDEX anymore." -- CodeRipper, Gray Areas
"Soon we were at the hotel going through the spoils: fax sheets, catalogs,
bits of torn paper, a few McDonald's Dino-Meals and lots of coffee grounds.
The documents disappeared in seconds."  -- Gillian Newson, New Media Magazine
Last year we held DEF CON I, which went over great, and this year we are
planning on being bigger and better.  We have expanded the number of
speakers to included midnight tech talks and additional speaking on Sunday.
We attempt to bring the underground into contact with "legitimate" speakers.
Sure it's great to meet and party with fellow hackers, but besides that we
try to provide information and speakers in a forum that can't be found at
other conferences.
While there is an initial concern that this is just another excuse for the evil hackers to party and wreak havok, it's just not the case.  People come
to DEF CON for information and for making contacts.  We strive to distinguish
this convention from others in that respect.
WHAT'S NEW THIS YEAR:
This year will be much larger and more organized (hopefully) than last year.
We have a much larger meeting area, and have better name recognition.
Because of this we will have more speakers on broader topics.  Expect
speaking to run Saturday and Sunday, ending around 5 p.m.  Some of the new
things expected include:
  provide serial connections because terminals are too hard to ship.  So
  bring a laptop with communications software if you want to connect to the
  network.  Thanks to cyberlink communications for the connection.
  and a few "Forbidden Subjects" cd ROMs to give away, thanks to Dead Addict.
  give away.
  If you have anything you want distributed, feel free to leave it on the
  designated tables.  Yes, this year there will be a true 24 hour
  convention space.
  VHS Format.  Mail me with suggested titles to show, or bring your own.
  We'll use a wall projector when not in use by speakers.
  technical topics and leave the days free for more general discussions.
WHO IS SPEAKING:=============================================================
This list represents almost all of the speakers verified to date.  Some
people do not want to be announced until the event for various reasons, or
are waiting for approval from employers.  A speaking schedule will go out
in the next announcement.
Phillip Zimmerman, Notorious Cryptographer & author of PGP.
Dr. Ludwig, Author of "The Little Black Book of Computer Viruses," and
    "Computer Viruses, Artificial Life and Evolution"
Loyd Blankenship (The Mentor), Net Running in the 90's and RPG.

There should be a few round table discussions on Virus, Cellular, Unix and
something else surrounding the industry.
I'll name the rest of the the speakers as they confirm.  I'm still working on
a few (Two?) people and groups, so hopefully things will work out and I can
pass the good news on in the next announcement, or over our List Server.
WHERE THIS THING IS:
It's in Las Vegas, the town that never sleeps.  Really. There are no clocks
anywhere in an attempt to lull you into believing the day never ends.  Talk
about virtual reality, this place fits the bill with no clunky hardware.  If
you have a buzz you may never know the difference.  It will be at the Sahara
Hotel.  Intel is as follows:
        The Sahara Hotel: 1.800.634.6078
        Room Rates: Single/Double $55, Tripple $65, Suite $120
                    (Usually $200) + 8% tax
        Transportation: Shuttles from the airport for cheap.
   NOTE:  Please make it clear you are registering for the DEF CON II
   convention to get the room rates.  Our convention space price is
   based on how many people register.  Register under a false name if
   it makes you feel better, 'cuz the more that register the better for
   my pocket book.  No one under 21 can rent a room by themselves, so
   get your buddy who is 21 to rent for you and crash out.  Try to contact
   people on the Interactive Mailing List (More on that below) and
   hook up with people.  Don't let the hotel people get their hands on
   your baggage, or there is a mandatory $3 group baggage fee.  Vegas
   has killer unions.
OTHER STUFF:
I'll whip up a list of stuff that's cool to check out in town there so if for
some reason you leave the awesome conference you can take in some unreal
sites in the city of true capitalism.  If anyone lives in Las Vegas, I
would appreciate it if you could send a list of some cool places to check out
or where to go to see the best shows
 and I'll post it in the next
announcement or in the program
-> I am asking for people to submit to me any artwork, pictures, drawings,
   logos, etc. that they want me to try and include in this years program.
   I am tring to not violate any copywrite laws, but wat cool shit.  Send
   me your art or whatever and I'll try and use it in the program, giving you
   credit for the work, of course.  Please send it in .TIF format if it has
   more than eight bit color.  The program will be eight bit black and white,
-> in case you want to make adjustments on your side.
*** NEW MAILING LIST SERVER ***
We've finally gotten Major Dommo List Serv software working (Kinda) and it
is now ready for testing.  MTV spent alot of time hacking this thing to work
with BSDi, and I would like to thank him.  The purpose of the list is to
allow people interested in DEF CON II to chat with one another.  It would
be very sueful for people over 21 who want to rent hotel space, but split
costs with others.  Just mention you have room for 'x' number of people, and
I'm sure you'll get a response from somone wanting to split costs.  Someone
also suggested that people could organize a massive car caravan from Southern
Ca. to the Con.  My attitude is that the list is what you make of it.  Here
are the specifics:
Umm.. I TAKE THAT BACK!!  The mailing list is _NOT_ ready yet.  Due to
technical problems, etc.  I'll do another mass mailing to everyone letting
them know that the list is up and how to access it.  Sorry for the delay!
Some of the places you can look for information from last year include:
New Media Magazine, September 1993
InfoWorld, 7-12-1993 and also 7-19-1993 by Robert X. Cringely
Gray Areas Magazine, Vol 2,  (Fall 1993)
Unix World, ???,
Phrack Cost is whatever you pay for a hotel room split however many ways, plus
$15 if you preregister, or $30 at the door.  This gets you a nifty 24 bit
color name tag (We're gonna make it niftier this year) and your foot in the
door.  There are fast food places all over, and there is alcohol all over
the place but the trick is to get it during a happy hour for maximum
I wanted to thank whoever sent in the anonymous fax to Wired that
was printed in issue 1.5  Cool deal!
