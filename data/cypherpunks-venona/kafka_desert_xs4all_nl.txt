Note the CHANGE OF
ADDRESS ! I enjoyed my time in Spain, working as a DJ and
PR-person. I used the laptop only once, to look up an address....
There's also a new version of the remailer software for Waffle 1.65.
The current version is now 2.02, and it supports now "Anon-To",
"Anon-Alternate-ID" now (only in 'penet' mode), and it now uses
the SPAWNO routines by Ralf Brown to minimize memory use while
running other programs (e.g. PGP).

2. ig16_10x.zip for 16 bit sound cards.  Better quality, but more data

the latest source code is also available as igps_10x.zip.
