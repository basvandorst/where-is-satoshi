I know that this isn't precisely on subject, but...
 Most of the people on this list probally do some
 amount of programming, right? Does anyone have
 information about self-modifing programs/routines?
 Thanks for the help.

Odd thing, in fact. Of course, Win95 and Mac are almost the same. They
run with all of the same controls, near exact features and functions.
It should also be noted that while most Netscape releases come out on Win95
first, Mac versions are never far away. For that matter, Netscape has also
been ported to X-Win.
Does this mean Win is a Mac copy? Absolutely. Does it mean M$ is bad?
Depends. MCI and Sprint provide the same service that AT&T used to, but
with minor changes. Microsoft has done the same.
Fare trade? Inability to place money into research&development? A sublime
desire to have that apple pie that was gone by the time he got to it?
Who knows what ethics are in Mr. Gates mind.

Take a young child to the mall. He or she sits on santa's lap.
Does the brain change at this point? The simple fact that the brain has
been altered in some way only proves that the child is concious.

@_subject: Taxing Churches for their views? Bad idea. (fwd) 
Agian, yes.
'Political Agenda' and free speech are two seperate things. Nowadays, free
speech is constantly being challanged by racism, bias and such. People sue
each other because they say something that makes someone feel bad. Churches
lie at the center of free speech, being awarded for their views by tax
exemption. Should 3M have tax exemptions because it gives people jobs?
While I do not want a debate over tax exemptions in churches, 'Free Speech'
may very well involve supporting canidates for positions in a democracy.
This is the very basis for elections. However, one begins to question this
reasoning when a church leader attempts to get into the government, using
the church's tax exemptions, for either support of the church, support of
self, or some illegal (or, at least, unethical) mix.
Should churches be tax exempt? Without their long history of helping people,
I doubt they would have any benifits. However, even if their privillige was
removed, they would simply be able to donate less money to community causes.
Uncle Sam (and his son, IRS) really shouldn't be applied to this subject:

I wonder... does Iraq have a web site?
While third world contries seldom have computer specialists, it seemed
pretty easy for Iraq to get biological weapon specialists working for
them. [Other more sensible arguments exist...]
Iraq has more money than they can reasonably spend, but management
troubles. Solution: IntraIraq, the network with Sadam ads. While burning
papers has some flare to it, it's pretty likely that most of the
classified data not in Sadam's head must be in some computer system[s],
easily housed by the UN no-no sites for inspectors.
Also, can Iraq's people create [and display] web pages?

Asside from this, when everyone finally figures out how to MIME encrypt
images, movies, sounds, etc. into their E-Mails, the net will become a
sespool of junk mail w/ 16-bit images that only really use 16 colors,
constantly flowng to and fro in a broth. Try to go to world-famous sites?
Ha! Spam is there, too.
The net can only handle so much, and spam by tradition isn't high on the

 (1) people (not to forget Gov) will have a reason to break singing codes
 (2) confidence in the system will make signing fraud a very happy-day

I would suggest, we all send a bit of spam out, 'accidentally' freeze the net
and show people what can happen. Asside from this personality change, little
can be done to keep people from sending spam (or, for that matter, pesonal
