I hope you're not serious.
In case you are:
It seems to be typical of American beliefs that Israelis are good, and
everybody else "down there" is bad. On the other hand, Israel wouldn't stand
a chance if US weren't having them as a pet. They are getting more and more
fundamentalistic (yes, there are zionistic fundamentalists, big surprise)
and they are not one bit better than anyone around.
It seems to me, that a few hothead terrorists create the image of all arabic
people in western heads. Consider this: Islam is a lot younger then
Christianity. If the Islamic people act like the Christian people we will
have a huge problem. A few hundred years ago everybody who didn't agree with
the pope was killed (Earth is flat after all). Now, according to my
timekeeping, Islam should reach that state around 2100. So there is plenty
of time for them to get nastier. (I don't think they will, because Islam is
a bit more tolerant than christianity ever was).
ps: I'm not Islamic, nor will I ever be, but I don't like fundamentalists,
and your views, should they be serious, sound *VERY* fundamentalist to me.

I don't think any decent programmer has never tried such an aproach to crack
for example PKZIP archives (the one on CD-ROMs, where you have to pay to get
the passwords). I certainly did back in 1991. I don't want to put down the
usefullness of such a program, but since probably more than 50% of all
passwords are vulnerable to dictionary attacks, such a utility has not too
much value. (have you ever tried all combinations from "aaaaaa" to "zzzzzz"
(there are around 2'176'782'336 <36^6> if you concider all umlauts like the
German auml;, uuml;, ouml;, ...). On the other hand, there won't be much
more than 10'000 6-letter words in any dictionary.
So it seems, a wordlist generator and a wordlist using cracker works a lot
better (and is almost as trivial to do - if you keep aside nice features)

--- all the following points are based on swiss circumstances, they may not
apply to US ---
Well, from a users point of view, sending packet data over a packet mode
bearer service is more efficient (and cheaper). An interesting developement
in this direction is the PMBS-A/B modes of ISDN (packet switching to the
public switch). The existance of this service suggests its usability.
We have a well developed DQDB-MAN and ATM net around, and bandwidth is
available (and getting cheaper by the minute). Currently, a onetime
investment of around $2500 per client is necessary to provide >5MBit/s
transfer volume (via the cable TV networks or the existing broadband networks)
Not if you have a dedicated packet switching network for asynchronous packet
transfer only. If you use it for both you don't have to have a very fast
network, you have to have a network with predictable and constant packet
delay. (that's not the same as fast!)
I guess Internet-telephony is one of the bandwidth killers.
There are of course a lot of alternatives:
- Existing wiring (5 MBit/s over 6 copper wires is possible)
- Usage of the cable networks
- Radio transmissions (RITL - radio in the loop)
- Satellite transmissions
Neither am I, but isn't anyone?
