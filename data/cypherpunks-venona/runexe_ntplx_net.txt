I wonder what would happen if we created competition for the gov't. Say,
make each state compete with each other, attempting to 'sell' services
(roads, welfare, real estate, etc.) for the cheapest rates (taxes). That
might force the gov't to radically change. One might say that exists now,
as people can choose the state they're in. But what if the state were not
restricted to only 'selling' within state lines, and the federal gov't had
competition as well? A true capitialist-democrasy.
Just some random thoughts.

Personally I had one semester of American Gov't, we had to memorize the
preamble (I know longer remember all of it, but I know the general ideas),
we studied the Bill of Rights (and the 14th Amendment), and the general
ideas of the constitution. While I don't think I got all the questions
correct on the quiz (some of the specific details, etc.), I know the
general ideas.
