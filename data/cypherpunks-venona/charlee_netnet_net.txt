Does anybody have any information on the "Cookie Monster" technology
that Netscape and Microsoft are soon going to incorperate in their internet
browsers?  All I know is that they take cookies and "eat" (destroy) them.

Yeah, but if the REAL email bomber were such an accomplished hacker,
he did not alter the scripts well enough to make the SysAdmin overlook them...

There is a new and VERY dangerous virus called the HAZ-MAT virus!
it fucks up the sectors on your hd, and really messes up the partition
tables.  It does this once a week, picking a random time to do it.  99.9% of
virus scanners and other antivirus programs will not recognize it, for it is
a totally new strain, using a never before seen code.... Be warned!  The
HAZ-MAT virus usually resides in JPG, and GIF files... once the files are
viewed, the virus takes effect.
scan all images upon download!

I do not know how it is run by the JPG and GIF files, but I do know that the
code somehow loads into the image viewer itself..I am not sure how it works,
just that it is very destructive.. I had it destroy my 486 (using Lview Pro)
Oh, well, ENOUGH already.  if you have something to say that is related to
"image files cant execute a virus" please do not. there are too many spams
with those ideas out now
