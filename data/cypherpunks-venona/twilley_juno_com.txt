Hi all,
     I am anxious to find an E-mail list forum dealing
with financial matters.  Possibly, there exists a forum to find a forum.
     Here in New Jersey there are rumors running about; that 401K's, and
other corporation contribution plans are corporate assets: both their
contribution, and the monies deducted from your
pay, as well as, any other contributions you may
have made.
     In the event of reorganization, in any form, including bankruptcy,
these monies are available for redistribution to creditors.  Meaning, not us.
     If true, it's a bit frightening; all and all.
