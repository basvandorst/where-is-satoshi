Would PGP on CD-ROM truely gaurantee a corrupt/virus free executable? A virus already running in memory could tamper with what it's doing, perhaps extracting the necessary keys and dumping them to a log file.
This would be especially dangerous on a UNIX system where many people might be using PGP, thinking it is secure.
I think the only way to be safe is to actually boot up off of the CD-ROM, and hope that the hardware in your computer physically hasn't been tampered with :)

I've found mkpgp to be a very useful tool, and an easy to use add on for 'pine' and pgp. But for those that prefer a GUI E-Mail application,
I think it would be great if Netscape were to integrate some more security in that portion of their navigator. Or perhaps a third party could add this in by creating a PGP 'Plugin' for Netscape...

Great idea! I'm sure there is a cyberpunk on this list willing to write a patch to NCSA HTTPd to get the job done, in a configurable manor of course so that a template.html would be 'inserted' at the top of every document sent out to the specified browser. Any takers?

@_subject: Netscape, Mosaic, and other goodies. 
Are you sure Netscape browsers are the only ones that currently implement this tag? Other browsers will be implementing it soon enough I'm sure. I think the only fool-proof way of doing it is at the webserver.
Anyway, isn't 5 million bux a little too much for the government to give Netscape for the security improvements? I would think that for less than a million a group of programmers could be rounded up to create a stable multi-platform web navigator with VRML, MPEG, Audio, Postscript, and a zillion other features built in. :)
It's funny how one day we are raving about how great Netscape is, and the next day we hate them. If we aren't pleased with a particular piece of software, instead of argueing about it we should just go and make one that we are pleased with. Using the many libraries available such as MPEG, GIF, JPEG for example and releasing it under the GNU agreement is the way to go. Or perhaps we should just back the original browser, NCSA Mosaic. With some improvements it could once again be the best browser on the net.
I suppose I'm not clear about the implications of these eskrow keys... just because the government is supporting it, and Netscape will be implementing it doesn't mean that we have to use it. Is it against the law to encrypt data (using your own method) and send it over the Internet?
I don't think so.

A somewhat useful utility would be one that would compress C code into as small space as possible, stripping out all spaces and making variable names one character a piece when possible. And of course one to expand it back into 'formatted' text, style could even be incorporated.

I don't think that was a smart thing to do. Your real email is now registered in some database in Finland - how difficult would it be to retrieve it? From what I remember organizations like Scientology had no problem getting real emails from anon.penet.fi when they reported that anXXXXXX was causing trouble... couldn't the same be done for your account?
If that single system becomes compromised one day all the accounts could be posted on some web page somewhere and it would be a simple matter of looking you up! Signing your message with PGP and using Mixmaster would give yourself an identity while still keeping you anonymous.

@_subject: Is it possible? 
Suppose I have the source of a C program that I would like to distribute on the Internet. This program computes some data (perhaps attempting to to do a partial brute force) and sends it's results to a server. The problem is someone might modify the source to simply contact the server saying "ok, my part of the brute force failed" and not even do anything. How can I be sure that the source has not been modified from the original distribution before it is compiled?
My original plan was to compute many digits of PI using the new Plouffe formula (allows you to compute any Hex digit of PI in linear time) but
perhaps trying to brute force things in this way isn't such a bad idea.

So is the idea beyond this that if file or a group of files were to be distributed over many computers (possibly hundreds or more) then none of the computers would be "responsible" for their content? I would think that any participant in the network would have to claim full responsibility for the content, assuming the file(s) could be accessed from any of the participating servers.
I'd be interesting in joining the Unmuzzy (programmers) mailing list, does anyone know what the email is or where the home page is? A net search returned nothing.

Are you sure it's a bug in the DOS version? When I did a pgp -kg in my UNIX shell (US version 2.6.2) I also entered 2048 bits and it too created a 2047 bit key instead.
Why is there a limit to the size of the key anyway? It's too bad PGP doesn't support any size key (within reason).

PGP encrypting a file and putting it on an ftp site is unusable unless you have the key to unlock it.. in this sense the file is only partly on-line and therefore there would be no need to even split the file apart to various servers! Would the site containing this PGP encrypted data be responsible for it's content?

What if you encrypt the encrypted software and put it on a server, and then have the key to it printed out on paper... you take the key with you to another country and fetch the 'incomplete' software through the net. It only becomes useful data once you apply your legally obtained key.
I guess this would be the same as putting the software on a private ftp site though, where only you would know the password.

I thought I'd contribute some noise to the cypherpunks list too, so here
goes. Why not just subscribe to the PGPdomo list, and see what the traffic is like for a couple days? Its not like you will be locked into the mailing list forever.
FYI the traffic on the PGPdomo list has been very low lately. I haven't
received a message from the list in a few days. But then again there is
even more 'noise' on that list because every message I've seen posted on
it talks about PGPdomo, the mailing list, getting PGP software to work,
etc.. From what I've seen people just sign up to test it out with a test
message, and thats about it. Even with mkpgp for pine its still a bit
inconvenient to use, I think thats the reason for the low-traffic.

U.S. government forbids the distribution of all cryptographic programs in
binary form; source code can be freely distributed.
Please point me towards the source/binary, or further information. (define(RSA m e n)(list->string(u(r(s(string->list m))e n))))(define(u a)(if(>

@_subject: DSN 
Anyone heard of DSN? I think thats the right order of the initials...
... its supposedly the only crypto-hardware solution for protecting an entire network on the Internet. You put one of these $5,000 units at one end of a lan, and another one somewhere else on the Internet, and the company gaurantees secure, encrypted transmissions. The TCP/IP headers and data are mangled, encrypted, etc.
It uses 512bit keys and I was just wondering how the authentication is
done. Does anyone have any specs on these units? Supposedly it does not
require a 3rd party entity to verify that the two units are both valid,
when determining the initial public/key pairs. Perhaps there is hardcoded
data in the units that is used to verify this? The company supposedly has some proprierty method ... how can we be sure this expensive unit can do its job if information on the encryption has not been released. Is there any freeware software solution that has been put through more of
a torture test, and proven to work? It seems to be the best approach would
be to put such a program on a server that is acting as the
gateway/firewall on each network. (define(RSA m e n)(list->string(u(r(s(string->list m))e n))))(define(u
a)(if(> a 0)(cons(integer->char(modulo a 256))(u(quotient a

@_subject: Re: The Decense Project 
How is it possible to have an anonymous <-> anonymous transaction. The
only way I see this can be done is to have the http data (c2.jpg for
example) actually pass through your cgi-bin script so that the original
identity (location) of the image is not revealed. This may be ok for some
text files and documents, but who would set up this program on their
server knowing that all their bandwidth is going to be gobbled up? Perhaps if the files were spread out across many servers (fragmented) in
some way none of the individual pieces could be linked to any other, but
as a whole the file could be accessed.
If you decide to go ahead with the chaining method that you described
above, maybe it would be best to have the cgi-bin program mail the file to
your E-Mail account. If there is going to be any delay at all, you might
as well make it go through some more anonymous servers (more secure) and
have it show up a little bit later in your mailbox.
