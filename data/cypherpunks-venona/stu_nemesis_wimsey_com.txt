@_subject: New program to integrate encryption/signing with mail/news 
I have written a new program to help integrate encryption and
signature programs such as (but not limited to) PGP.  This is
the doc file that is included.  I am going to try to upload it
to ftp.csua.berkeley.edu, the cypherpunks ftp site, in directory
sure where it will end up, but if you can't find it or don't
have ftp, I will gladly mail it to you.
This is the first program of any sort, simple though it is, that
I have ever unleashed on the public at large, comments are
greatly appreciated - please be gentle :)
I'm biased of course, but I find it a rather elegant (ergonomic
is what I want to say :) way to let users encrypt or sign
messages.  Please give it a try, it is freeware and may be
distributed under the GNU Public License.
mess - automagic Mail Encryption and Signing System for mail & news
Copyright 1994 Stuart Smith
May be distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License.
This program is meant to be run in lieu of an editor from a mail or news
program.  The editor you want to use should be the first argument on
the command line.  The article or message to be edited should be the second.
mess first starts the editor with the specified file.  If you want your
message to be encrypted or signed, place one or more of the following strings
at the beginning of a line.  (i.e. each string must start at the beginning of
its own line)
 [encrypt]
 [encrypt]  [sign]
 [sign] Only the first encrypt or sign string will be acted on and removed from the
text.  Further copies are ignored.  If you add a space and a key ID,
these will be added to the PGP command line so that PGP will not ask
you for them.  A key ID (any text fragment unique to a public key
description) is considered as everything from one space after the [encrypt]/[sign] string.
mess now also scans headers, if they are included, for To: or From: headers
and will use these as key_ID's.  If you specify a key_ID after [sign] or
 [encrypt], it will override the key_ID found in the headers.  I use trn,
which does pass headers to the editor and it seems to work great.  Elm
doesn't though so I can't test it, but I assume it would work as well.  I
had to try and make the program smart enough to figure out if there even
are headers.  To do this, it first splits the file in two at the first blank
line.  Everything above is considered header lines.  If however, it does not
match From:, To:, or Subject:, then it assumes that headers were not in fact
included in the file and that it is really just parsing the first paragraph. In which case it throws it out and just uses the whole file as the body,
with no headers.
If a public or secret key is not found matching the key_ID found in the
header or entered manually, PGP will fail, leaving your message intact,
including the [encrypt]/[sign] strings, if present.
I've tried not to emphasize PGP to much because I wrote the program so
that it could be used with any encryption program. PGP is of course a
natural for the job.  Right now, the defaults for the encrypt and sign
strings, encrypt and sign options, and even the encryption program to call
are in  statements, so they're pretty easy to change.  In the
future I might add a configuration file for such things or allow them
to be specified on the command-line.
Ideas I have for the near future include somewhat better help for wrong
command-line args and such;  configuration file for some default or more
command-line options;  allow mailers or news readers that will do this to
pass sender & recipient information on the command line;  less moving
around of temp files - right now the plaintext of a message gets copied
into a temporary file before going to pgp, and while *that* temporary file
is wiped by pgp, the original file is only deleted.  I will try and
organize things better or perhaps if someone can point me to a portable
file wipe?
The executable included runs under OS/2 with the emx runtime package.
I've tried to avoid doing anything platform specific (I use OS/2),
if I messed up, let me know.
I have tested the program using Elm for OS/2 and TRN for OS/2 which I use
to read mail and news from the UUPC v1.2b program.  I got the idea for
the [encrypt] and [sign] bit from Elm_2 for OS/2 which had something
similar, but I tried to improve on it.  I would like to hear from people
using this on other computers or with other mail/news programs.  If you have
any suggestions, please forward them, thanks.
I hope you find this useful, I'd appreciate any comments & ideas.

In article <199406300128.SAA25746 you write:
This is what junk messages are for.  A good remailer should mail
out random packets at random times 24 hrs a day, only some of
which would contain valid messages.  Making the sender of the
message try to time its delivery to a "busy" time would be
Another thing that a good remailer should do, randomly pad
messages that it sends out.  I don't know if any of the current
crop actually do this though.
I can't really think of any criteria.  It doesn't matter if the
first remailer knows your address or even if they decide to tell
the NSA you're using their remailer - as long as the other
remailers ( or most of them anyways ) aren't compromised, it
should still be very hard to trace any given message.
Absolutely nothing.  If a message passes through x number of
people, and everyone of those people are working for the
government/intimitdated by the government - nothing on this
earth will keep your identity secret.  Think about it.  This is
another reason we should have *lots* of remailers - not only
does the difficulty in traffic analysis increase, but if one or
more remailers is compromised (read: bribed/threatened etc), you
should still be ok.
There is a possibility they are still sunk - we don't know what
they know, so they might know something we don't know - you
know?  But... if most (I don't know how many or what percentage)
of the remailers were secure (not compromised/working for the
gov't) when the messages were sent and they kept *no* logs, even
going so far as to wipe from memory and disk any trace of
incoming and outgoing messages, then the problem the gov't
agencies face is not a problem of "clout" - it is a problem of
cryptanalysis.  The only way, at this point, to find the sender
is to start decrypting messages send to/from remailers (the
gov't would have had to capture them previously or they would be
gone now) and track what messages went where.  This brings up
another point, even if the remailers aren't/weren't compromised,
they *do* have the secret keys that the message was encrypted
with along each hop, so theoretically, unless every remailer
operator wiped his secret key immediately after such an event,
the government could tap/bribe/intimidate/rubber-hose its way to
the remailer's secret key and track the sender (with its
previously tapped messages to and from every remailer) long
after the event.
Perhaps remailers should get in the habit of changing keys often
or automatically.  If you wanted, you could "subscribe" to a
remailer to use it, and it would send you a new key say, every
24 hours.  Perhaps there could be another key for casual users
who can't be bothered.
Nothing at all.. unless you can code PGE - Pretty Good Ethics
and get the Gov't to use it.

In article  you write:
... maybe I don't like paying for 20 copies of the EFF press
release coming down my UUCP link?
Just a thought...
Perhaps the EFF people would like to include a little header in
their releases explaining the groups/lists which already
receive the text automatically and explain the concept of
reference pointers.

In article <199407020841.AA23083 you write:
In general, multiple encryption does not signifigantly increase
security.  Just for starters, we don't know if IDEA is a group..
If it is, you can encrypt all you want and you won't get one
extra bit of security.  Trying to analyse just *one*
cryptosystem or algorithm for security holes and information
leaks is hard enough - trying to analyse the interaction between
several layers of said algorithm or even between different
algorithms seems harder and lacking in promise.  Of course you
could view this as defence of multiple-encryption: "if there
*is* some weird interaction that reveals my key when you xor the
secret-key file with any Nick Danger script, no one will ever
discover it because it will be too hard"  but this strikes me as
the security through obscurity myth.
You can't get something for nothing.  With a 12 bit pass phrase,
you have 12 bits of security - I don't see any known way to
increase this without increasing the pass phrase length.
I haven't looked into this alot, but I wonder how the approach
used with many unix passwd utilities would fare?  For instance,
checking password/phrase crackability if you will - comparing
against a dictionary, measuring entropy or just plain not
accepting pass phrases shorter than x.  Also, many passwd utils
will generate "pronouncable" random text.  Perhaps with several
short words generated thusly would get you the entropy you need.

@_subject: PGP Bastardization 
The time for constructive comments about a new algorithm such as
yours is *before* you release code.  IDEA and RSA were already
well respected ciphers before PGP was released.
You may be correct in that Phil Zimmermann has no legal
recourse, but I counldn't say for sure.  I am more concerned
with the ethical issues.  What have you called your new
super-duper pgp?  If you make it abundantly clear that it is
*your* hack of pgp, and not supported in any way by RSA, MIT, or
prz, I personally wouldn't have a problem with it.
It is my feeling that cryptographic software is an entirely
different beast from other software released under such free
licenses.  If I improve or port some one's mail reader for
instance, out of *common courtesy*, the first thing I would do
is contact the author to let him know.  Any bugs in such a
program would make themselves readily apparent and users would
quickly learn whether or not my version was really an
improvement.  How is a user to know that his data has less of a
chance of being compromised using super-kool-pgp than prz's own
version?  The people reading his compromised mail certainly
aren't going to tell him that his cryptographic software has a
bug in it.
I think a lot of this issue has less to do with the law and more
to do with courtesy to fellow software authors.

@_subject: Re: Please verify key for remailer@soda 
I hope we're all clever enough to realize that this is not very
good key verification.  If a spoofer has managed to spoof the
key to soda that you got, then he will spoof the fingerprints
that everyone sends you.  Finding a way to do this that can't be
spoofed is nontrivial.
However, you can take some reasurance, IMO, in the idea that if
someone was spoofing any given widely held key, such as that to
a remailer, someone would, eventually, smell something fishy. i.e.  one day you go to mail a message to a soda from a
different account only to have it fail because your other
account provider was spoofing you.

@_subject: Re: Remailer ideas (Was: Re: Latency vs. Reordering) 
In article <199407282120.RAA07884 you write:
I thought extra useless junk traffic was one main objective of a
remailing network?   The more the better..  As far as the idea
that an eavesdropper could tell which remailers you are going to
use - they already know.  They can ping the same sites you do
and as long as you ping *every* site you know of, instead of
just the ones you'd like to use on any given message, this
doesn't give the spooks one iota of new information.
As long as the key isn't trusted just because it was in the
newsgroup - this sounds workable.  Or, each remailer could have
a mailing list of addresses it sends the "i'm here" message to. Again, this gets the spooks no new information - if you use a
remailer even once, you have to assume that if some one was
watching closely enough, they *know* you used the system, and
they *know* your chosen destination received a message from the
system.  They just can't figure out who sent what to who.
This seems backwards to me - I think what you want is local
software that is smart enough to figure out the state of the
remailer-net.  You needn't rip apart nor rebuild the whole net,
just write some code :)
